an idiot!" she said.

"do you mind awfully?"

"no! that's what i mind!"

he changed to conversation. he was famous at conversation. he spoke
reasonably of psychoanalysis, long island polo, and the ming platter
he had found in vancouver. she promised to meet him in deauville, the
coming summer, "though," she sighed, "it's becoming too dreadfully
banal; nothing but americans and frowsy english baronesses."

and at that moment in zenith, a cocaine-runner and a prostitute were
drinking cocktails in healey hanson's saloon on front street. since
national prohibition was now in force, and since zenith was notoriously
law-abiding, they were compelled to keep the cocktails innocent
by drinking them out of tea-cups. the lady threw her cup at the
cocaine-runner's head. he worked his revolver out of the pocket in his
sleeve, and casually murdered her.

at that moment in zenith, two men sat in a laboratory. for thirty-seven
hours now they had been working on a report of their investigations of
synthetic rubber.

he drove from the severe rectangular streets of the modern business
center into the tangled byways of old town--jagged blocks filled with
sooty warehouses and lofts; on into the arbor, once a pleasant orchard
but now a morass of lodging-houses, tenements, and brothels. exquisite
shivers chilled his spine and stomach, and he looked at every policeman
with intense innocence, as one who loved the law, and admired the force,
and longed to stop and play with them. he parked his car a block from
healey hanson's saloon, worrying, "well, rats, if anybody did see me,
they'd think i was here on business."

he entered a place curiously like the saloons of ante-prohibition days,
with a long greasy bar with sawdust in front and streaky mirror behind,
a pine table at which a dirty old man dreamed over a glass of something
which resembled whisky, and with two men at the bar, drinking something
which resembled beer, and giving that impression of forming a large
crowd which two men always give in a saloon. the

 card, an engraved card, a card in the blackest black
and the sharpest red, announcing that mr. george f. babbitt was estates,
insurance, rents. the bartender held it as though it weighed ten pounds,
and read it as though it were a hundred words long. he did not bend from
his episcopal dignity, but he growled, "i'll see if he's around."

from the back room he brought an immensely old young man, a quiet
sharp-eyed man, in tan silk shirt, checked vest hanging open, and
burning brown trousers--mr. healey hanson. mr. hanson said only "yuh?"
but his implacable and contemptuous eyes queried babbitt's soul, and he
seemed not at all impressed by the new dark-gray suit for which (as he
had admitted to every acquaintance at the athletic club) babbitt had
paid a hundred and twenty-five dollars.

"glad meet you, mr. hanson. say, uh--i'm george babbitt of the
babbitt-thompson realty company. i'm a great friend of jake offutt's."

"well, what of it?"

"say, uh, i'm going to have a party, and jake told me you'd b

fix me up with a little gin." in alarm, in obsequiousness, as hanson's
eyes grew more bored, "you telephone to jake about me, if you want to."

hanson answered by jerking his head to indicate the entrance to the
back room, and strolled away. babbitt melodramatically crept into
an apartment containing four round tables, eleven chairs, a brewery
calendar, and a smell. he waited. thrice he saw healey hanson saunter
through, humming, hands in pockets, ignoring him.

by this time babbitt had modified his valiant morning vow, "i won't pay
one cent over seven dollars a quart" to "i might pay ten." on hanson's
next weary entrance he besought "could you fix that up?" hanson scowled,
and grated, "just a minute--pete's sake--just a min-ute!" in growing
meekness babbitt went on waiting till hanson casually reappeared with
a quart of gin--what is euphemistically known as a quart--in his
disdainful long whit

n. he stood
before the pier-glass, viewing his trim dinner-coat, his beautiful
triple-braided trousers; and murmured in lyric beatitude, "by golly,
i don't look so bad. i certainly don't look like catawba. if the hicks
back home could see me in this rig, they'd have a fit!"

he moved majestically down to mix the cocktails. as he chipped ice, as
he squeezed oranges, as he collected vast stores of bottles, glasses,
and spoons at the sink in the pantry, he felt as authoritative as the
bartender at healey hanson's saloon. true, mrs. babbitt said he was
under foot, and matilda and the maid hired for the evening brushed by
him, elbowed him, shrieked "pleasopn door," as they tottered through
with trays, but in this high moment he ignored them.

besides the new bottle of gin, his cellar consisted of one half-bottle
of bourbon whisky, a quarter of a bottle of italian vermouth, and
approximately one hundred drops of orange bitters. he did not possess
a cocktail-shaker. a shaker was proof of dissipation, the

he said, trying not to sound sullen.

"i'll tell you: i'll get minnie sonntag to drive down with you." tanis
was pointing to the thin, sarcastic young woman.

miss sonntag greeted him with an astringent "how d'you do, mr. babbitt.
tanis tells me you're a very prominent man, and i'm honored by being
allowed to drive with you. of course i'm not accustomed to associating
with society people like you, so i don't know how to act in such exalted
circles!"

thus miss sonntag talked all the way down to healey hanson's. to her
jibes he wanted to reply "oh, go to the devil!" but he never quite
nerved himself to that reasonable comment. he was resenting the
existence of the whole bunch. he had heard tanis speak of "darling
carrie" and "min sonntag--she's so clever--you'll adore her," but
they had never been real to him. he had pictured tanis as living in a
rose-tinted vacuum, waiting for him, free of all the complications of a
floral heights.

when they returned he had to endure the patronage of the young
