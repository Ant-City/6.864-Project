[CHARACTER] - 
                the
brave, noble general whose children, according to the witches' prophecy,
will inherit the scottish throne. like macbeth, [CHARACTER] thinks ambitious
thoughts, but he does not translate those thoughts into action.
in a sense, [CHARACTER]'s character stands as a rebuke to macbeth, since
he represents the path macbeth chose not to take: a path in which
ambition need not lead to betrayal and murder. appropriately, then,
it is [CHARACTER]'s ghost--and not duncan's--that haunts macbeth. in addition
to embodying macbeth's guilt for killing [CHARACTER], the ghost also
reminds macbeth that he did not emulate [CHARACTER]'s reaction to the
witches' prophecy.
