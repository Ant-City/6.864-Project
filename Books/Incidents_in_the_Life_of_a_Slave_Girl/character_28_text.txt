de open. every evening i examined the newspapers carefully, to see what southerners had put up at the hotels. i did this for my own sake, thinking my young mistress and her husband might be among the list; i wished also to give information to others, if necessary; for if many were "running to and fro," i resolved that "knowledge should be increased."

        this brings up one of my southern reminiscences,

page 288
which i will here briefly relate. i was somewhat acquainted with a slave named luke, who belonged to a wealthy man in our vicinity. his master died, leaving a son and daughter heirs to his large fortune. in the division of the slaves, luke was included in the son's portion. this young man became a prey to the vices growing out of the "patriarchal institution," and when he went to the north, to complete his education, he carried his vices with him. he was brought home, deprived of the use of his limbs, by excessive dissipation. luke was appointed to wait upon his bed-ridden mas

ration at his own helplessness. he kept a cowhide beside him, and, for the most trivial occurrence, he would order his attendant to bare his back, and kneel beside the couch, while he whipped him till his strength was exhausted. some days he was not allowed to wear any thing but his shirt, in order to be in readiness to be flogged. a day seldom passed without his receiving more or less blows. if the slightest resistance was offered, the town constable was sent for to execute the punishment, and luke learned from experience how much more the constable's strong arm was to be dreaded than the comparatively feeble one of his master. the arm of his tyrant grew weak, and was finally palsied; and then the constable's services were in constant requisition. the fact that he was entirely dependent on luke's care, and was obliged to be tended like an infant, instead of inspiring any gratitude or compassion towards his poor slave, seemed only to increase his irritability and cruelty. as he lay there o

he took into his head the strangest freaks of despotism; and if luke hesitated to submit to his orders, the constable was immediately sent for. some of these freaks were of a nature too filthy to be repeated. when i fled from the house of bondage, i left poor luke still chained to the bedside of this cruel and disgusting wretch.

        one day, when i had been requested to do an errand for mrs. bruce, i was hurrying through back streets, as usual, when i saw a young man approaching, whose face was familiar to me. as he came nearer, i recognized luke. i always rejoiced to see or hear of any one who had escaped from the black pit; but, remembering this poor fellow's extreme hardships, i was peculiarly glad to see him on northern soil, though i no longer

        this is a fair specimen of how the moral sense is educated by slavery. when a man has his wages stolen from him, year after year, and the laws sanction and enforce the theft, how can he be expected to have more regard to honesty than has the man who robs him? i have become somewhat enlightened, but i confess that i agree with poor, ignorant, much-abused luke, in thinking he had a right to that money, as a portion of his unpaid wages. he went to canada forthwith, and i have not since heard from him.

        all that winter i lived in a state of anxiety. when i took the children out to breathe the air, i closely observed the countenances of all i met. i dreaded the approach of summer, when snakes and slaveholders make their appearance. i was, in fact, a slave in new york, as subject to slave laws as i had been in a slave state. strange incongruity i
