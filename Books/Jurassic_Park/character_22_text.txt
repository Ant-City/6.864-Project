 bag on a commercial airline flight. morris often wondered what would have happened
if the capsule had broken open during the flight. everybody on the plane might have been
infected with rabies.
it was outrageous. it was irresponsible. it was criminally negligent. but no action was taken
against biosyn. the chilean farmers who unwittingly risked their lives were ignorant peasants;
the government of chile had an economic crisis to worry about; and the american authorities had
no jurisdiction. so lewis dodgson, the geneticist responsible for the test, was still working at
biosyn. biosyn was still as reckless as ever. and other american companies were hurrying to set
up facilities in foreign countries that lacked sophistication about genetic research. countries that
perceived genetic engineering to be like any other high-tech development, and thus welcomed it to
their lands, unaware of the dangers posed.
"so that's why we began our investigation of ingen," morris said. "about three weeks ago."
"and wh

target of opportunity
the biosyn corporation of cupertino, california, had never called an emergency meeting of its
board of directors. the ten directors now sitting in the conference room were irritable and
impatient. it was 8:00 p.m. they had been talking among themselves for the last ten minutes, but
slowly had fallen silent. shuffling papers. looking pointedly at their watches.
"what are we waiting for?" one asked.
"one more," lewis dodgson said. "we need one more." he glanced at his watch. ron meyer's
office had said he was coming up on the six o'clock plane from san diego. he should be here by
now, even allowing for traffic from the airport.
"you need a quorum?" another director asked.
"yes," dodgson said. "we do."
that shut them up for a moment. a quorum meant that they were going to be asked to make
an important decision. and god knows they were, although dodgson would have preferred not to
call a meeting at all. but steingart

en, the head of biosyn, was adamant. "you'll have to get their
agreement for this one, lew," he had said.
depending on who you talked to, lewis dodgson was famous as the most aggressive
geneticist of his generation, or the most reckless. thirty-four, balding, hawk-faced, and intense,
he had been dismissed by johns hopkins as a graduate student, for planning gene therapy on
human patients without obtaining the proper fda protocols. hired by biosyn, he had conducted
the controversial rabies vaccine test in chile. now he was the head of product development at
biosyn, which supposedly consisted of "reverse engineering": taking a competitor's produ

a long silence descended over the room. the men looked at the secretary, taking notes, and
the tape recorder on the table in front of her.
"i don't see the need for a formal resolution on this," dodgson said. "just a sense of the room,
as to whether you feel i should proceed. . . ."
slowly the heads nodded.
nobody spoke. nobody went on record. they just nodded silently.
"thank you for coming, gentlemen," dodgson said. "i'll take it from here."
airport
lewis dodgson entered the coffee shop in the departure building of the san francisco airport
and looked around quickly. his man was already there, waiting at the counter. dodgson sat down
next to him and placed the briefcase on the floor between them.
"you're late, pal," the man said. he looked at the straw hat dodgson was wearing and laughed.
"what is this supposed to be, a disguise?"
"you never know," dodgson said, suppressing his anger. for six months, dodgson had
patiently cultivated this man, who had gr

yed with the jurassic park project;
late in the schedule, ingen had demanded extensive modifications to the system but hadn't been
willing to pay for them, arguing they should be included under the original contract. lawsuits were
threatened; letters were written to nedry's other clients, implying that nedry was unreliable. it was
blackmail, and in the end nedry had been forced to eat his overages on jurassic park and to
make the changes that hammond wanted.
but later, when he was approached by lewis dodgson at biosyn, nedry was ready to listen.
and able to say that he could indeed get past jurassic park security. he could get into any room,
any system, anywhere in the park. because he had programmed it that way. just in case.
he entered the fertilization room. the lab was deserted; as he had anticipated, all the staff was
at dinner. nedry unzipped his shoulder bag and removed the can of gillette shaving cream. he
unscrewed the base, and saw the interior was divided into a series of cylindrical slo
