â€œtrue,â€ replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree at
the tragic remembrance thus called up; â€œbut bear in mind, if you please,
that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from
diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which i may remark, that
while my family remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled
princes, your father lost no time in joining the new government; and
that while the citizen noirtier was a girondin, the count noirtier
became a senator.â€

â€œdear mother,â€ interposed renÃ©e, â€œyou know very well it was agreed that
all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.â€

â€œsuffer me, also, madame,â€ replied villefort, â€œto add my earnest request
to mademoiselle de saint-mÃ©ranâ€™s, that you will kindly allow the veil of
oblivion to cover and conceal the past. what avails recrimination over

fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences
was based upon sound and excellent principles. then the king, who,
without our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted
us by saying, â€˜villefortâ€™--observe that the king did not pronounce the
word noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on
that of villefort--â€˜villefort,â€™ said his majesty, â€˜is a young man of

â€œi am free, then, sir?â€ cried dantÃ¨s joyfully.

â€œyes; but first give me this letter.â€

â€œyou have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which i
see in that packet.â€

â€œstop a moment,â€ said the deputy, as dantÃ¨s took his hat and gloves. â€œto
whom is it addressed?â€

_â€œto monsieur noirtier, rue coq-hÃ©ron, paris.â€_ had a thunderbolt fallen
into the room, villefort could not have been more stupefied. he sank
into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the fatal
letter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror.

â€œm. noirtier, rue coq-hÃ©ron, no. 13,â€ murmured he, growing still paler.

â€œyes,â€ said dantÃ¨s; â€œdo you know him?â€

â€œno,â€ replied villefort; â€œa faithful servant of the king does not know
conspirators.â€


â€œit is a conspiracy,

â€œyes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,â€
 said villefort.

â€œi was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.â€

â€œhave you shown this letter to anyone?â€ asked villefort, becoming still
more pale.

â€œto no one, on my honor.â€

â€œeverybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the
island of elba, and addressed to m. noirtier?â€

â€œeverybody, except the person who gave it to me.â€

â€œand that was too much, far too much,â€ murmured villefort. villefortâ€™s
brow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched teeth filled
dantÃ¨s with apprehension. after reading the letter, villefort covered
his face with his hands.

â€œoh,â€ said dantÃ¨s timidly, â€œwhat is the matter?â€ villefort made no
answer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and
again perused the letter.

â€œand you say that you

â€œi want none; it was a temporary indisposition. attend to yourself;
answer me.â€ dantÃ¨s waited, expecting a question, but in vain. villefort
fell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with
perspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.

â€œoh, if he knows the contents of this!â€ murmured he, â€œand that noirtier
is the father of villefort, i am lost!â€ and he fixed his eyes upon
edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.

â€œoh, it is impossible to doubt it,â€ cried he, suddenly.

â€œin heavenâ€™s name!â€ cried the unhappy young man, â€œif you doubt me,
question me; i will answer you.â€ villefort made a violent effort, and in
a tone he strove to render firm,--

the most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. the boat they
were in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor
outside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on
some distant point. he was not bound, nor had they made any attempt to
handcuff him; this seemed a good augury. besides, had not the deputy,
who had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not pronounce
the dreaded name of noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend? had not
villefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof
against him?

he waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.

â€œin person.â€

â€œwhy did you not mention his name at once?â€ replied the king, betraying
some uneasiness.

â€œsire, i thought his name was unknown to your majesty.â€

â€œno, no, blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding,
ambitious, too, and, _pardieu!_, you know his fatherâ€™s name!â€

m. noirtier--for it was, indeed, he who entered--looked after the
servant until the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he
might be overheard in the antechamber, he opened the door again, nor was
the precaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain,
who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first
parents. m. noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the
antechamber door, then that of the bedchamber, and then extended his
hand to villefort, who ha

â€œwell, now, my dear gÃ©rard,â€ said he to the young man, with a very

see me?â€

â€œmy dear father,â€ said villefort, â€œi am, on the contrary, delighted; but
i so little expected your visit, that it has somewhat overcome me.â€

â€œbut, my dear fellow,â€ replied m. noirtier, seating himself, â€œi might
say the same thing to you, when you announce to me your wedding for the

â€œthe king himself.â€

â€œwell, then, in return for your story,â€ continued noirtier, â€œi will tell

â€œi burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that
letter must have led to your condemnation.â€

â€œand the destruction of your future prospects,â€ replied noirtier; â€œyes,

â€œdark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers black; blue frock-coat,
buttoned up to the chin; rosette of an officer of the legion of honor in
his button-hole; a hat with wide brim, and a cane.â€

â€œah, ha, thatâ€™s it, is it?â€ said noirtier; â€œand why, then, have they not
laid hands on him?â€

â€œbecause yesterday, or the day before, they lost sight of him at the
corner of the rue coq-hÃ©ron.â€

â€œdidnâ€™t i say that your police were good for nothing?â€

â€œyes; but they may catch him yet.â€

villefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration.

his whiskers cut off, noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took,
instead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top
of an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned
frock-coat, a coat of villefortâ€™s of dark brown, and cut away in front;
tried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his sonâ€™s, which
appeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner where
he had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the air with

â€œwell,â€ he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise
was completed, â€œwell, do you think your police will recognize me now.â€

â€œno, father,â€ stammered villefort; â€œat least, i hope not.â€

â€œand now, my dear boy,â€ continued noirtier, â€œi rely on your prudence to
remove all the things which i leave in your care.â€

saved my life; be assured i will return the favor hereafter.â€ villefort
shook his head.

another turn, and cast you aloft while hurling me down. adieu, my dear
gÃ©rard, and at your next journey alight at my door.â€ noirtier left the
room when he had finished, with the same calmness that had characterized
him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation.

of man with ambition and its first successes.



chapter 13. the hundred days

m. noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he had
predicted. everyone knows the history of the famous return from elba, a
return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably remain
without a counterpart in the future.

louis xviii. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow; the
monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious
foundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of
ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the gro

therefore, gained nothing save the kingâ€™s gratitude (which was rather
likely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the legion of
honor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although m. de blacas had
duly forwarded the brevet.

napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived villefort of his office had it
not been for noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the
girondin of â€˜93 and the senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had
been his protector. all villefortâ€™s influence barely enabled him to
stifle the secret dantÃ¨s had so nearly divulged. the kingâ€™s procureur
alone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.

however, scarcely was the imperial power established--that is, scarcely
had the emperor re-entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from
the closet into which we have

dantÃ¨s obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which
consisted only of the account of a voyage to india, and two or three
voyages to the levant, until he arrived at the recital of his last
cruise, with the death of captain leclere, and the receipt of a packet
to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with that
personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a letter
addressed to a monsieur noirtier--his arrival at marseilles, and
interview with his father--his affection for mercÃ©dÃ¨s, and their nuptual
feast--his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary detention at
the palais de justice, and his final imprisonment in the chÃ¢teau dâ€™if.
from this point everything was a blank to dantÃ¨s--he knew nothing more,
not even the length of time he had been imprisoned. his recital
finished, the abbÃ© reflected long and earnestly.

â€œthere is,â€ said he, at the end of his meditations, â

â€œyes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more
dangerous than the others.â€

â€œnever mind; let us go on.â€

â€œwith all my heart! you tell me he burned the letter?â€

â€œhe did; saying at the same time, â€˜you see i thus destroy the only proof
existing against you.â€™â€

â€œthis action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.â€

â€œyou think so?â€

â€œi am sure of it. to whom was this letter addressed?â€

â€œto m. noirtier, no. 13 coq-hÃ©ron, paris.â€

â€œnow can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could
possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?â€

â€œwhy, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me
promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring
me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he
insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in
the address.â€

gazed on him in utter astonishment.

â€œdo you see that ray of sunlight?â€

â€œi do.â€

â€œwell, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you.

noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed?
noirtier was his father.â€

had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of dantÃ¨s, or hell opened its
yawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely
transfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected
words. starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to
prevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, â€œhis father! his

seemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him
greatly, for after having perused the first documents he turned over the

he found everything arranged in due order,--the accusation, examination,
morrelâ€™s petition, m. de villefortâ€™s marginal notes. he folded up the
accusation quietly, and put it as quietly in his pocket; read the
examination, and saw that the name of noirtier was not mentioned in it;
perused, too, the application dated 10th april, 1815, in which morrel,
by the deputy procureurâ€™s advice, exaggerated with the best intentions
(for napoleon was then on the throne) the services dantÃ¨s had rendered
to the imperial cause--services which villefortâ€™s certificates rendered
indisputable. then he saw through the whole thing. this petition to
napoleon, kept back by villefort, had become, under the second
restoration, a terrible weapon against him in the han

â€œand where is she, then? if you know, why donâ€™t you tell?â€

â€œshe is under the big chestnut-tree,â€ replied the spoiled brat, as he
gave, in spite of his motherâ€™s commands, live flies to the parrot, which
seemed keenly to relish such fare. madame de villefort stretched out her
hand to ring, intending to direct her waiting-maid to the spot where she

 said madame de villefort, evidently agitated. â€œvalentine, will you not
go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner?â€ valentine rose, and
saluting the count, left the apartment without speaking.

â€œoh, madame,â€ said the count, when valentine had left the room, â€œwas it
on my account that you sent mademoiselle de villefort away?â€

â€œby no means,â€ replied the young lady quickly; â€œbut this is the hour
when we usually give m. noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his
pitiful existence. you are aware, sir, of the deplorable condition of my
husbandâ€™s father?â€

â€œyes, madame, m. de villefort spoke of it to me--a paralysis, i think.â€

â€œalas, yes; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless; the mind alone
is still active in this human machine, and that is faint and flickering,
like the light of a lamp about to expire. but excuse me, sir, for

beautiful portraits out of a splendid album, â€œthe individual who took

mutilated book from the urchinâ€™s grasp, â€œyou are positively past

â€œi wonâ€™t go unless you give me the album,â€ said the boy, seating himself
doggedly in an armchair, according to his habit of never giving way.

my grandmother, the marquis and marquise de saint-mÃ©ran, will leave me

be poor in comparison with me. now, if i had taken the veil, all this

â€œoh, yes!â€ valentine mounted on a bench, and passed not only her finger
but her whole hand through the opening. maximilian uttered a cry of
delight, and, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards him,
and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss. the little hand was
then immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw valentine hurrying
towards the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own
sensations.



chapter 58. m. noirtier de villefort

we will now relate what was passing in the house of the kingâ€™s attorney
after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter, and during the
time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine, which we have
just detailed. m. de villefort entered his fatherâ€™s room, followed by
madame de villefort. both of the visitors, after saluting the old man
and speaking to barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five
years in his service, took their places on either side

 of the paralytic.

m. noirtier was sitting in an armchair, which moved upon casters, in
which he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way
drawn out again at night. he was placed before a large glass, which
reflected the whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move,
which would have been impossible, he could see all who entered the room
and everything which was going on around him. m. noirtier, although
almost as immovable as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick
and intelligent expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious
courtesy, that they were come on business of an unexpected and official
character. sight and hearing were the only senses remaining, and they,
like two solitary sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which
seemed fit for nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of
one of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feeli

ngs that
still occupied his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his
inner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees
by night across some desert place, and knows that a living being dwells
beyond the silence and obscurity. noirtierâ€™s hair was long and white,
and flowed over his shoulders; while in his eyes, shaded by thick black
lashes, was concentrated, as it often happens with an organ which is
used to the exclusion of the others, all the activity, address, force,
and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body; and
so although the movement of the arm, the sound of the voice, and the
agility of the body, were wanting, the speaking eye sufficed for all. he
commanded with it; it was the medium through

persons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic; these
were villefort, valentine, and the old servant of whom we have already
spoken. but as villefort saw his father but seldom, and then only when
absolutely obliged, and as he never took any pains to please or gratify
him when he was there, all the old manâ€™s happiness was centred in his
granddaughter. valentine, by means of her love, her patience, and her
devotion, had learned to read in noirtierâ€™s look all the varied feelings
which were passing in his mind. to this dumb language, which was so
unintelligible to others, she answered by throwing her whole soul into
the expression of her countenance, and in this manner were the
conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless
invalid, whose body could scarcely be called a living one, but who,
nevertheless, possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration, united with
a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body re

impulses. valentine had solved the problem, and
was able easily to understand his thoughts, and to convey her own in
return, and, through her untiring and devoted assiduity, it was seldom
that, in the ordinary transactions of every-day life, she failed to
anticipate the wishes of the living, thinking mind, or the wants of the
almost inanimate body. as to the servant, he had, as we have said, been
with his master for five and twenty years, therefore he knew all his
habits, and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for
anything, so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of
the invalid. villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the
domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation
which he was about to begin. as we have said, he perfectly understood
the old manâ€™s vocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was
only indifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing. he
therefore allowed valentine to go into the gar

den, sent away barrois,
and after having seated himself at his fatherâ€™s right hand, while madame
de villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:--

â€œi trust you will not be displeased, sir, that valentine has not come
with us, or that i dismissed barrois, for our conference will be one
which could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.
madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you.â€

noirtierâ€™s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,
while, on the contrary, villefortâ€™s eye was endeavoring to penetrate
into the inmost recesses of the old manâ€™s heart.

â€œthis communication,â€ continued the procureur, in that cold and decisive
tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, â€œwill, we are
sure, meet with your approbation.â€ the eye of the invalid still retained
that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any
knowledge of the feel

ings which were passing in his mind; he listened,
nothing more. â€œsir,â€ resumed villefort, â€œwe are thinking of marrying
valentine.â€ had the old manâ€™s face been moulded in wax it could not have
shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there. â€œthe
marriage will take place in less than three months,â€ said villefort.
noirtierâ€™s eye still retained its inanimate expression.

madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added,--
â€œwe thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have
always entertained a great affection for valentine; it therefore only
now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is
destined. it is one of the most desirable connections which could
possibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in society, and
every personal qualificati

happy,--his name, moreover, cannot be wholly unknown to you. it is m.
franz de quesnel, baron dâ€™epinay.â€

while his wife was speaking, villefort had narrowly watched the old
manâ€™s countenance. when madame de villefort pronounced the name of
franz, the pupil of m. noirtierâ€™s eye began to dilate, and his eyelids
trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an
individual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at madame de
villefort and his son. the procureur, who knew the political hatred
which had formerly existed between m. noirtier and the elder dâ€™epinay,
well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had
produced; but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed
the narrative begun by his wife. â

d that valentineâ€™s future husband will
consent, not to live in this house, for that might not be pleasant for
the young people, but that you should live with them; so that you and
valentine, who are so attached to each other, would not be separated,
and you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which
you have hitherto done, and thus, instead of losing, you will be a
gainer by the change, as it will secure to you two children instead of
one, to watch over and comfort you.â€

noirtierâ€™s look was furious; it was very evident that something
desperate was passing in the old manâ€™s mind, for a cry of anger and
grief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance,
appeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple
with the struggle. villefort quietly opened a window, saying, â€œit is
very warm, and the heat affects m. noirtier.â€ he then returned to his
place, but did not sit down. â€œthis marriage,â€ added madame de villefort,

â€œthat assassination was a mysterious affair,â€ said villefort, â€œand the
perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has
fallen on the head of more than one person.â€ noirtier made such an
effort that his lips expanded into a smile.

â€œnow,â€ continued villefort, â€œthose to whom the guilt really belongs, by
whom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may
probably descend here, and the certain judgment of god hereafter, would
rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace-
offering as valentine on the son of him whose life they so ruthlessly
destroyed.â€ noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion more than

 was sufficient to tell her that her
grandfather was suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he
was wishing to communicate to her. â€œdear grandpapa,â€ cried she, â€œwhat
has happened? they have vexed you, and you are angry?â€ the paralytic
closed his eyes in token of assent. â€œwho has displeased you? is it my
father?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œmadame de villefort?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œme?â€ the former sign was repeated. â€œare you displeased with me?â€ cried
valentine in astonishment. m. noirtier again closed his eyes. â€œand what
have i done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with me?â€ cried
valentine.

there was no answer, and she continued. â€œi have not seen you all day.
has anyone been speaking to you against me?â€

â€œyes,â€ said the old manâ€™s look, with eagerness.

â€œlet me think a moment. i do assure you, grandpapa--ah--m. and madame de

â€œyes.â€

â€œand it was they who told you something which made you angry?

think what it could be.

â€œah, i know,â€ said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old
man. â€œthey have been speaking of my marriage,--have they not?â€

â€œyes,â€ replied the angry look.

â€œi understand; you are displeased at the silence i have preserved on the
subject. the reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping the
matter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it.

€ said valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and
putting her arm round her grandfatherâ€™s neck, â€œi am vexed, too, for i do
not love m. franz dâ€™epinay.â€ an expression of intense joy illumined the
old manâ€™s eyes. â€œwhen i wished to retire into a convent, you remember
how angry you were with me?â€ a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid.
â€œwell,â€ continued valentine, â€œthe reason of my proposing it was that i
might escape this hateful marriage, which drives me to despair.â€
 noirtierâ€™s breathing came thick and short. â€œthen the idea of this
marriage really grieves you too? ah, if you could but help me--if we
could both together defeat their plan! but you are unable to oppose
them,--you, whose mind is so quick, and whose will is so firm are
nevertheless, as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself. alas,
you, who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days of
your health and strength, can now only sympathize in my joys and
sorrows, without being able

at these words there appeared in noirtierâ€™s eye an expression of such
deep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words
there: â€œyou are mistaken; i can still do much for you.â€

â€œdo you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?â€ said valentine.

â€œyes.â€ noirtier raised his eyes, it was the sign agreed on between him
and valentine when he wanted anything.

â€œwhat is it you want, dear grandpapa?â€ said valentine, and she
endeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to
need; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind, she repeated
them aloud, then,--finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a
constant _â€œno,â€_--she said, â€œcome, since this plan does not answer, i
will have recourse to another.â€ she then recit

made her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing
he wanted. â€œah,â€ said valentine, â€œthe thing you desire begins with the
letter n; it is with n that we have to do, then. well, let me see, what
can you want that begins with n? na--ne--ni--noâ€--

â€œyes, yes, yes,â€ said the old manâ€™s eye.

â€œah, it is no, then?â€

â€œyes.â€ valentine fetched a dictionary, which she placed on a desk before
noirtier; she opened it, and, seeing that the odd manâ€™s eye was
thoroughly fixed on its pages, she ran her finger quickly up and down
the columns. during the six years which had passed since noirtier first
fell into this sad state, valentineâ€™s powers of invention had been too
often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients
for gaining a knowledge of his wishes, and the constant practice had so
perfected her in the art that she guessed the old manâ€™s meaning as
quickly as if he

 himself had been able to seek for what he wanted. at
the word _notary_, noirtier made a sign to her to stop.

â€œnotary,â€ said she, â€œdo you want a notary, dear grandpapa?â€ the old man
again signified that it was a notary he desired.


â€œyou would wish a notary to be sent for then?â€ said valentine.

â€œyes.â€

â€œshall my father be informed of your wish?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œdo you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?â€

young girl smiled on her grandfather, as if he had been a child. m. de

declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant, who both
knew what his wishes were, he was quite prepared to maintain the
contest. â€œdo you wish for a notary?â€ asked villefort.

â€œyes.â€

â€œwhat to do?â€

noirtier made no answer. â€œwhat do you want with a notary?â€ again
repeated villefort. the invalidâ€™s eye remained fixed, by which
expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable.
â€œis it to do us some ill turn? do you think it is worth while?â€ said
villefort.

person who dares to refuse my request.â€

â€œyou shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir,â€ said
villefort; â€œbut i shall explain to him your state of health, and make

chapter 59. the will

as soon as barrois had left the room, noirtier looked at valentine with
a malicious expression that said many things. the young girl perfectly
understood the look, and so did villefort, for his countenance became
clouded, and he knitted his eyebrows angrily. he took a seat, and
quietly awaited the arrival of the notary. noirtier saw him seat himself
with an appearance of perfect indifference, at the same time giving a
side look at valentine, which made her understand that she also was to
remain in the room. three-quarters of an hour after, barrois returned,
bringing the notary with him. â€œsir,â€ said villefort, after the first
salutations were over, â€œyou were sent for by m. noirtier, whom you see
here. all his limbs have become completely paralysed, he has lost his
voice also, and we ourselves find much trouble in

valentine, which look was at once so earnest and imperative, that she
answered immediately. â€œsir,â€ said she, â€œi perfectly understand my
grandfatherâ€™s meaning at all times.â€

â€œthat is quite true,â€ said barrois; â€œand that is what i told the
gentleman as we walked along.â€

â€œpermit me,â€ said the notary, turning first to villefort and then to
valentine--â€œpermit me to state that the case in question is just one of
those in which a public officer like

useless, and cannot be legally exercised.â€ the notary then prepared to
retire. an imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of
the procureur. noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full
of grief, that she arrested the departure of the notary. â€œsir,â€ said
she, â€œthe language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily
learnt, and i can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it almost as
well as i can myself. will you tell me what you require, in order to set
your conscience quite at ease on the subject?â€

â€œin order to render an act valid, i must be certain of the approbation

validity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite.â€

â€œwell, sir, by the help of two signs, with which i will acquaint you
presently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather
is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties. m.
noirtier, being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey
his meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify â€˜yes,â€™ and to
wink when he means â€˜no.â€™ you now know quite enough to enable you to
converse with m. noirtier;--try.â€ noirtier gave valentine such a look of
tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary
himself. â€œyou have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been
saying, sir, have you?â€ asked the notary. noirtier closed his eyes. â

â€œyes.â€

â€œto make your will?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œand you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original
intentions?â€ the old man winked violently. â€œwell, sir,â€ said the young
girl, â€œdo you understand now, and is your conscience perfectly at rest
on the subject?â€ but before the notary could answer, villefort had drawn
him aside. â€œsir,â€ said he, â€œdo you suppose for a moment that a man can
sustain a physical shock, such as m. noirtier has received, without any
detriment to his mental faculties?â€

â€œit is not exactly that, sir,â€ said the notary, â€œwhich makes me uneasy,
but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so as
to be able to get his answers.â€

â€œyou must see that to be an utter impossibility,â€ said villefort.
valentine and the old man heard this conversation, and noirtier fixed
his eye so earnestly on valentine that she felt bound to answer to the
look.

young lady as your interpreter, m. noirtier?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwell, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that you
wish to be drawn up?â€ valentine named all the letters of the alphabet

her notice that she was to stop. â€œit is very evident that it is the

valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she repeated, â€œwa--we--wiâ€--
the old man stopped her at the last syllable. valentine then took the
dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages.
she passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when she came to the
word â€œwill,â€ m. noirtierâ€™s eye bade her stop. â€œwill,â€ said the notary;
â€œit is very evident that m. noirtier is desirous of making his will.â€

â€œyes, yes, yes,â€ motioned the invalid.

astonished notary, turning to m. de villefort. â€œyes,â€ said the

ging to know what his fatherâ€™s intentions
were. he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent, but
barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his masterâ€™s wishes,
and had already gone to fetch one. the procureur then told his wife to
come up. in the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had assembled in
the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also arrived. a few
words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of
the law. they read to noirtier the formal copy of a will, in order to
give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally
couched; then, in order to test the capacity of the testator, the first
notary said, turning towards him,--â€œwhen an individual makes his will,
it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person.â€

â€œyes.â€

.â€ there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation. never had
the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now, and if
it was not a sublime, it was, at least, a curious spectacle. they had
formed a circle round the invalid; the second notary was sitting at a
table, prepared for writing, and his colleague was standing before the
testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have
alluded. â€œyour fortune exceeds 300,000 francs, does it not?â€ asked he.
noirtier made a sign that it did. â€œdo you possess 400,000 francs?â€
 inquired the notary. noirtierâ€™s eye remained immovable.

â€œfive hundred thousand?â€ the same expression continued.

â€œ600,000--700,000--800,000--900,000?â€

noirtier stopped him at the last-named sum.

â€œyou are then in possession of 900,000 francs?â€ asked the notary.

francs in bank scrip. the first notary handed over each note, as he
examined it, to his colleague.

the total amount was found to be as m. noirtier had stated. â€œit is all
as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still retains its full
force and vigor.â€ then, turning towards the paralytic, he said, â€œyou
possess, then, 900,000 francs of capital, which, according to the manner
in which you have invested it, ought to bring in an income of about
40,000 livres?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œto whom do you desire to leave this fortune?â€

â€œoh,â€ said madame de villefort, â€œthere is not much doubt on that
subject. m. noirtier tenderly love

has, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, i had almost
said the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that she
should reap the fruit of her devotion.â€ the eye of noirtier clearly
showed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent
given by madame de villefortâ€™s words and manner to the motives which she
supposed him to entertain. â€œis it, then, to mademoiselle valentine de
villefort that you leave these 900,000 francs?â€ demanded the notary,
thinking he had only to insert this clause, but waiting first for the
assent of noirtier, which it was necessary should be given before all
the witnesses of this singular scene. valentine, when her name

r eyes were cast down, and she was crying. the old man
looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest
tenderness, then, turning towards the notary, he significantly winked
his eye in token of dissent.

â€œwhat,â€ said the notary, â€œdo you not intend making mademoiselle
valentine de villefort your residuary legatee?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œyou are not making any mistake, are you?â€ said the notary; â€œyou really
mean to declare that such is not your intention?â€

â€œno,â€ repeated noirtier; â€œno.â€ valentine raised her head, struck dumb
with astonishment. it was not so much the conviction that she was
disinherited that caused her grief, but her total inability to account
for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act. but
noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she
exclaimed, â€œoh, grandpapa, i see now that it is only your fortune of
which you deprive me; you still leave me the love which i have always
enjoyed.â€

â€œah, yes, most

assuredly,â€ said the eyes of the paralytic, for he closed
them with an expression which valentine could not mistake. â€œthank you,
thank you,â€ murmured she. the old manâ€™s declaration that valentine was
not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of
madame de villefort; she gradually approached the invalid, and said:
â€œthen, doubtless, dear m. noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune to
your grandson, edward de villefort?â€ the winking of the eyes which
answered this speech was most decided and terrible, and expressed a
feeling almost amounting to hatred.

â€œno?â€ said the notary; â€œthen, perhaps, it is to your son, m. de
villefort?â€

â€œno.â€ the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and
inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator. villefort
and his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other from a

 said valentine; â€œyou no

villefort and his wife, and rested on valentine with a look of
unutterable fondness. â€œwell,â€ said she; â€œif you love me, grandpapa, try
and bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment.
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never thought of
your fortune; besides, they say i am already rich in right of my mother-
-too rich, even. explain yourself, then.â€ noirtier fixed his intelligent
eyes on valentineâ€™s hand.

â€œmy hand?â€ said she.

â€œyes.â€

â€œher hand!â€ exclaimed everyone.

â€œoh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my fatherâ€™s mind is
really impaired,â€ said villefort.

â€œah,â€ cried valentine suddenly, â€œi understand. it is my marriage you
mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?â€

â€œyes, yes, yes,â€ signed the paralytic, casting on valentine a look of
joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning.

â€œyou are angry with us

 all on account of this marriage, are you not?â€

â€œyes?â€

â€œreally, this is too absurd,â€ said villefort.

â€œexcuse me, sir,â€ replied the notary; â€œon the contrary, the meaning of
m. noirtier is quite evident to me, and i can quite easily connect the
train of ideas passing in his mind.â€

â€œyou do not wish me to marry m. franz dâ€™epinay?â€ observed valentine.


â€œi do not wish it,â€ said the eye of her grandfather.

â€œand you disinherit your granddaughter,â€ continued the notary, â€œbecause
she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œso that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?â€

â€œyes.â€ there was a profound silence. th

â€œno.â€

â€œdo you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?â€ pursued the
notary.

â€œyes.â€

â€œbut,â€ said the notary, â€œyou are aware that the law does not allow a son
to be entirely deprived of his patrimony?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œyou only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which
the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?â€
 noirtier made no answer. â€œdo you still wish to dispose of all?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œbut they will contest the will after your death?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œmy father knows me,â€ replied villefort; â€œhe is quite sure that his
wishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands that in my
position i cannot plead against the poor.â€ the eye of noirtier beamed
with triumph. â€œwhat do you decide on, sir?â€ asked the notary of
villefort.

â€œnothing, sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and

power which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune, and may blast the
prospects of my child also, as it is all occasioned by an old man
relapsed into second childhood.â€

â€œwhat do you say?â€ said the count; â€œ900,000 francs? it is indeed a sum
which might be regretted even by a philosopher. and who is the cause of
all this annoyance?â€

â€œmy father, as i told you.â€

â€œm. noirtier? but i thought you told me he had become entirely
paralyzed, and that all his faculties were completely destroyed?â€

â€œyes, his bodily faculties, for he can neither move nor speak,
nevertheless he thinks, acts, and wills in the manner i have described.
i left him about five minutes ago, and he is now occupied in dictating
his will to two notaries.â€

superiority. the name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be
reverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to
obey. but, under the present circumstances, i am justified in doubting
the wisdom of an old man who, because he hated the father, vents his
anger on the son. it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by
such caprices. i shall still continue to preserve the same respect
toward m. noirtier; i will suffer, without complaint, the pecuniary
deprivation to which he has subjected me; but i shall remain firm in my
determination, and the world shall see which party has reason on his
side. consequently i shall marry my daughter to the baron franz
dâ€™epinay, because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for
her to make, and, in short, because i choose to bestow my daughterâ€™s
hand on whomever i please.â€

noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort because she is going to
marry m. le baron franz dâ€™epinay?â€

â€œyes, sir, that is the reason,â€ said villefort, shrugging his shoulders.

â€œthe apparent reason, at least,â€ said madame de villefort.

â€œthe _real_ reason, madame, i can assure you; i know my father.â€

â€œbut i want to know in what way m. dâ€™epinay can have displeased your
father more than any other person?â€

â€œi believe i know m. franz dâ€™epinay,â€ said the count; â€œis he not

of general de quesnel, who was created baron dâ€™epinay by charles x.?â€

â€œthe same,â€ said villefort.

â€œwell, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.â€

â€œhe is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of m. noirtier
to prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in
their affection,â€ said madame de villefort.

â€œbut,â€ said monte cristo â€œdo you not know any cause for this hatred?â€

â€œah, _ma foi_, who is to know?â€

â€œperhaps it is some political difference?â€

â€œmy father and the baron dâ€™epinay lived in the stormy times of which i
only saw the ending,â€ said villefort.

â€œwas not your father a bonapartist?â€ asked monte cristo; â€œi think i
remember that you told me

something of that kind.â€

â€œmy father has been a jacobin more than anything else,â€ said villefort,
carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; â€œand the senatorâ€™s
robe, which napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to disguise the
old man without in any degree changing him. when my father conspired, it
was not for the emperor, it was against the bourbons; for m. noirtier
possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any utopian schemes which
could never be realized, but strove for possibilities, and he applied to
the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the
mountain,--theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed
necessary to bring about the desired result.â€

â€œwell,â€ said monte cristo, â€œit is just as i thought; it was politics
which brought noirtier and m. dâ€™epinay into personal contact. although

at the count almost with terror. â€œam i mistaken, then?â€ said monte
cristo.

â€œno, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,â€ said madame de
villefort; â€œand it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that m. de
villefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two
children of these inveterate enemies.â€

â€œit was a sublime and charitable thought,â€ said monte cristo, â€œand the
whole world should applaud it. it would be noble to see mademoiselle
noirtier de villefort assuming the title of madame franz dâ€™epinay.â€
 villefort shuddered and looked at monte cristo as if he wished to read
in his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he had
just uttered. but the count completely baffled the procureur, and
prevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying smile
he was so constantly in the habit of assuming. â€œalthough,â€ said
villefort, â€œit will be a serious thing for valentine to lose her

rtune, i do not think that m. dâ€™epinay will be
frightened at this pecuniary loss. he will, perhaps, hold me in greater
esteem than the money itself, seeing that i sacrifice everything in
order to keep my word with him. besides, he knows that valentine is rich
in right of her mother, and that she will, in all probability, inherit
the fortune of m. and madame de saint-mÃ©ran, her motherâ€™s parents, who
both love her tenderly.â€

â€œand who are fully as well worth loving and tending as m. noirtier,â€
 said madame de villefort; â€œbesides, they are to come to paris in about a
month, and valentine, after the affront she has received, need not
consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up
with m. noirtier.â€ the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of
wounded self-love and defeated ambition. â€œbut it seems to me,â€ said
monte cristo, â€œand i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am
about to say, that if m. noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de v

because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested, he cannot
have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward.â€

â€œtrue,â€ said madame de villefort, with an intonation of voice which it
is impossible to describe; â€œis it not unjust--shamefully unjust? poor
edward is as much m. noirtierâ€™s grandchild as valentine, and yet, if she
had not been going to marry m. franz, m. noirtier would have left her
all his money; and supposing valentine to be disinherited by her
grandfather, she will still be three times richer than he.â€ the count
listened and said no more. â€œcount,â€ said villefort, â€œwe will not
entertain you any longer with our family misfortunes. it is true that my
patrimony will go to endow charitable institutions, and my father will
have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing
so, but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i

arm, and her bonnet in her hand. the white hair was thrown back from her
yellow forehead, and her eyes, already sunken by the furrows of age, now
almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief. â€œoh, sir,â€
 she said; â€œoh, sir, what a misfortune! i shall die of it; oh, yes, i
shall certainly die of it!â€

and then, falling upon the chair nearest the door, she burst into a
paroxysm of sobs. the servants, standing in the doorway, not daring to
approach nearer, were looking at noirtierâ€™s old servant, who had heard
the noise from his masterâ€™s room, and run there also, remaining behind
the others. villefort rose, and ran towards his mother-in-law, for it
was she.

â€œwhy, what can have happened?â€ he exclaimed, â€œwhat has thus disturbed
you? is m. de saint-mÃ©ran with you?â€

â€œm. de saint-mÃ©ran is dead,â€ answered the old marchioness, without
preface and without expression; she appeared to be stupefied. villefort
drew back, and clasping his hands together, exclaimed-

t only replied by offering his arm to his daughter. it was
just in time, for valentineâ€™s head swam, and she staggered; madame de
villefort instantly hastened to her assistance, and aided her husband in
dragging her to the carriage, saying--â€œwhat a singular event! who could
have thought it? ah, yes, it is indeed strange!â€ and the wretched family
departed, leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of the
evening. at the foot of the stairs, valentine found barrois awaiting
her.

â€œm. noirtier wishes to see you tonight, he said, in an undertone.

â€œtell him i will come when i leave my dear grandmamma,â€ she replied,
feeling, with true delicacy, that the person to whom she could be of the
most service just then was madame de saint-mÃ©ran. valentine found her
grandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung sobs, broken sighs,
burning tears, were all that passed in this sad interview, while madame
de villefort, leaning on her husbandâ€™s arm, maintained all outward forms
of respect, a

husband, â€œi think it would be better for me to retire, with your
permission, for the sight of me appears still to afflict your mother-in-
law.â€ madame de saint-mÃ©ran heard her. â€œyes, yes,â€ she said softly to
valentine, â€œlet her leave; but do you stay.â€ madame de villefort left,
and valentine remained alone beside the bed, for the procureur, overcome
with astonishment at the unexpected death, had followed his wife.
meanwhile, barrois had returned for the first time to old noirtier, who
having heard the noise in the house, had, as we have said, sent his old
servant to inquire the cause; on his return, his quick intelligent eye
interrogated the messenger. â€œalas, sir,â€ exclaimed barrois, â€œa great
misfortune has happened. madame de saint-mÃ©ran has arrived, and her
husband is dead!â€

m. de saint-mÃ©ran and noirtier had never been on strict terms of
friendship; still, the death of one old man always considerably affects
another. noirtier let his head fall upon his che

overwhelmed and thoughtful; then he closed one eye, in token of inquiry.
â€œmademoiselle valentine?â€ noirtier nodded his head. â€œshe is at the ball,
as you know, since she came to say good-bye to you in full dress.â€
 noirtier again closed his left eye. â€œdo you wish to see her?â€ noirtier
again made an affirmative sign. â€œwell, they have gone to fetch her, no
doubt, from madame de morcerfâ€™s; i will await her return, and beg her to
come up here. is that what you wish for?â€

â€œyes,â€ replied the invalid.

barrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for valentine, and informed
her of her grandfatherâ€™s wish. consequently, valentine came up to
noirtier, on leaving madame de saint-mÃ©ran, who in the midst of her
grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish

 sleep.
within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a
bottle of orangeade, her usual beverage, and a glass. then, as we have
said, the young girl left the bedside to see m. noirtier. valentine
kissed the old man, who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes
again filled with tears, whose sources he thought must be exhausted. the
old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression.
â€œyes, yes,â€ said valentine, â€œyou mean that i have yet a kind grandfather
left, do you not.â€ the old man intimated that such was his meaning. â€œah,
yes, happily i have,â€ replied valentine. â€œwithout that, what would
become of me?â€

orning. barrois, who wished to go to bed
himself, observed that after such sad events everyone stood in need of
rest. noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see his
child, but wished her good-night, for grief and fatigue had made her
appear quite ill. the next morning she found her grandmother in bed; the
fever had not abated, on the contrary her eyes glistened and she
appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability. â€œoh, dear
grandmamma, are you worse?â€ exclaimed valentine, perceiving all these
signs of agitation.

assassinated some days before the usurper returned from the island of
elba?â€

â€œthe same.â€

â€œdoes he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a
jacobin?â€

â€œour civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother,â€ said
villefort; â€œm. dâ€™epinay was quite a child when his father died, he knows
very little of m. noirtier, and will meet him, if not with pleasure, at
least with indifference.â€

â€œis it a suitable match?â€

â€œin every respect.â€

â€œand the young man?â€

â€œis regarded with universal esteem.â€

â€œyou approve of him?â€

â€œhe is one of the most well-bred young men i know.â€ during the whole of
this conversation valentine had remained silent. â€œwell, sir,â€ said

â€œfrom an apoplectic stroke.â€

â€œyes, and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband, whom she never
left, has called her, and that she must go and join him. oh, m.

â€œwhere is she?â€

â€œin her room with the notary.â€

moving or speaking.â€

â€œand the same love for you--eh, my dear child?â€

â€œyes,â€ said valentine, â€œhe was very fond of me.â€

â€œwho does not love you?â€ valentine smiled sadly. â€œwhat are your
grandmotherâ€™s symptoms?â€

that the contract is to be signed this evening.â€

morrel went also to the notary, who confirmed the news that the contract
was to be signed that evening. then he went to call on monte cristo and
heard still more. franz had been to announce the ceremony, and madame de
villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting

widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should

â€œof whom?--how?--of what?â€

â€œmay not barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have given

â€œyes.â€

â€œbut how could a dose prepared for m. noirtier poison madame de saint-

â€œnothing is more simple. you know poisons become remedies in certain
diseases, of which paralysis is one. for instance, having tried every
other remedy to restore movement and speech to m. noirtier, i resolved
to try one last means, and for three months i have been giving him

grains. this quantity, which is perfectly safe to administer to the

motionless, grief seeming to deprive her of all fear. m. de villefort
passed on to his own room. â€œnow,â€ said valentine, â€œyou can neither go
out by the front door nor by the garden.â€ morrel looked at her with
astonishment. â€œthere is but one way left you that is safe,â€ said she;
â€œit is through my grandfatherâ€™s room.â€ she rose, â€œcome,â€ she added.

young girlâ€™s wishes; â€œi now see my error--i acted like a madman in

crossed the corridor, and led the way down a narrow staircase to m.
noirtierâ€™s room; morrel followed her on tiptoe; at the door they found
the old servant. â€œbarrois,â€ said valentine, â€œshut the door, and let no
one come in.â€ she passed first. noirtier, seated in his chair, and
listening to every sound, was watching the door; he saw valentine, and
his eye brightened. there was something grave and solemn in the approach
of the young girl which struck the old man, and immediately his bright
eye began to interrogate. â€œdear grandfather.â€ said she hurriedly, â€œyou

world but you.â€ his expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness. â€œto

that he recollected him. â€œwell, grandpapa,â€ said valentine, kneeling
before him, and pointing to maximilian, â€œi love him, and will be only
his; were i compelled to marry another, i would destroy myself.â€

the eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts.
â€œyou like m. maximilian morrel, do you not, grandpapa?â€ asked valentine.

â€œyes.â€

â€œand you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of my
father?â€--noirtier cast an intelligent glance at morrel, as if to say,
â€œperhaps i may.â€ maximilian understood him.

â€œmademoiselle,â€ said he, â€œyou have a sacred duty to fulfil in your
deceased grandmotherâ€™s room, will you allow me the honor of a few
minutesâ€™ conversation with m. noirtier?â€

â€œthat is it,â€ said the old manâ€™s eye. then he looked anxiously at
valentine.

â€œdo you fear he will not understand?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œoh, we have so often spoken of you, that he knows exactly how i talk

to
you.â€ then turning to maximilian, with an adorable smile; although
shaded by sorrow,--â€œhe knows everything i know,â€ said she.

valentine arose, placed a chair for morrel, requested barrois not to
admit anyone, and having tenderly embraced her grandfather, and
sorrowfully taken leave of morrel, she went away. to prove to noirtier
that he was in valentineâ€™s confidence and knew all their secrets, morrel
took the dictionary, a pen, and some paper, and placed them all on a
table where there was a light.

â€œbut first,â€ said morrel, â€œallow me, sir, to tell you who i am, how much
i love mademoiselle valentine, and what are my designs respecting her.â€
 noirtier made a sign that he would listen.

it was an imposing sight to witness this old man, apparently a mere
useless burden, becoming the sole protector, support, and

â€œand now,â€ said morrel, when he had finished the first part of his
recital, â€œnow i have told you of my love and my hopes, may i inform you
of my intentions?â€

â€œyes,â€ signified the old man.

â€œthis was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in
which i intended to carry off valentine to my sisterâ€™s house, to marry
her, and to wait respectfully m. de villefortâ€™s pardon.â€

â€œno,â€ said noirtier.

â€œwe must not do so?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œyou do not sanction our project?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œthere is another way,â€ said morrel. the old manâ€™s interrogative eye
said, â€œwhat?â€

â€œi will go,â€ continued maximilian, â€œi will seek m. franz dâ€™epinay--i am
happy to be able to mention this in mademoiselle de villefortâ€™s absence-
-and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge
me.â€ noirtierâ€™s look continued to interrogate. â€œyou wish to know what i
will do?â€

renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure
my friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through
interest or ridiculous pride, after i have proved to him that he would
be forcing my wife from me, that valentine loves me, and will have no
other, i will fight with him, give him every advantage, and i shall kill
him, or he will kill me; if i am victorious, he will not marry
valentine, and if i die, i am very sure valentine will not marry him.â€
 noirtier watched, with indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere
countenance, on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted,
adding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to
a sound and faithful drawing. still, when morrel had finished, he shut
his eyes several times, which was his manner of saying â€œno.â€

â€œno?â€ said morrel; â€œyou disapprove of this second project, as you did of
the first?â€

â€œi do,â€ signified the old man.

last request was, that the marriage might not be delayed; must i let
things take their course?â€ noirtier did not move. â€œi understand,â€ said
morrel; â€œi am to wait.â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œbut delay may ruin our plan, sir,â€ replied the young man. â€œalone,
valentine has no power; she will be compelled to submit. i am here
almost miraculously, and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to
occur again. believe me, there are only the two plans i have proposed to
you; forgive my vanity, and tell me which you prefer. do you authorize
mademoiselle valentine to intrust herself to my honor?â€

oubt his will, if they did his power. â€œoh,
thank you a thousand times! but how, unless a miracle should restore
your speech, your gesture, your movement, how can you, chained to that
armchair, dumb and motionless, oppose this marriage?â€ a smile lit up the
old manâ€™s face, a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face. â€œthen i
must wait?â€ asked the young man.

â€œyes.â€

â€œbut the contract?â€ the same smile returned. â€œwill you assure me it
shall not be signed?â€

â€œyes,â€ said noirtier.

â€œthe contract shall not be signed!â€ cried morrel. â€œoh, pardon me, sir; i
can scarcely realize so great a happiness. will they not sign it?â€

â€œno,â€ said the paralytic. notwithstanding that assurance, morrel still
hesitated. this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that,
instead of being the result of the power of his will, it might emanate
from enfeebled organs. is it not natural that the madman, ignorant of
his folly, should attempt things beyond his power? the weak man

talks of
burdens he can raise, the timid of giants he can confront, the poor of
treasures he spends, the most humble peasant, in the height of his
pride, calls himself jupiter. whether noirtier understood the young
manâ€™s indecision, or whether he had not full confidence in his docility,
he looked uneasily at him. â€œwhat do you wish, sir?â€ asked morrel; â€œthat
i should renew my promise of remaining tranquil?â€ noirtierâ€™s eye
remained fixed and firm, as if to imply that a promise did not suffice;
then it passed from his face to his hands.

â€œshall i swear to you, sir?â€ asked maximilian.

â€œyes,â€ said the paralytic with the same solemnity. morrel understood
that the old man attached great importance to an oath. he extended his
hand.

â€œi swear to you, on my honor,â€ said he, â€œto await your decision
respecting the course i am to pursue with m. dâ€™epinay.â€

â€œthat is right,â€ said the old man.

€œnow,â€ said morrel, â€œdo you wish me to retire?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwithout seeing mademoiselle valentine?â€

â€œyes.â€

morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey. â€œbut,â€ said he, â€œfirst
allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now.â€ noirtierâ€™s
expression could not be understood. the young man pressed his lips on
the same spot, on the old manâ€™s forehead, where valentineâ€™s had been.
then he bowed a second time and retired.

he found outside the door the old servant, to whom valentine had given
directions. morrel was conducted along a dark passage, which led to a
little door opening on the garden, soon found the spot where he had
entered, with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall,
and by his ladder was in an i

of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could hardly
produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint-

â€œat any rate,â€ said albert, â€œwhatever disease or doctor may have killed
her, m. de villefort, or rather, mademoiselle valentine,--or, still
rather, our friend franz, inherits a magnificent fortune, amounting, i
believe, to 80,000 livres per annum.â€

â€œand this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin,
noirtier.â€

â€œthat is a tenacious old grandfather,â€ said beauchamp. â€œ_tenacem
propositi virum_. i think he must have made an agreement with death to
outlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed. he resembles
the old conventionalist of â€˜93, who said to napoleon, in 1814, â€˜you bend

the notary, after having, according to the customary method, arranged
the papers on the table, taken his place in an armchair, and raised his
spectacles, turned towards franz:

â€œare you m. franz de quesnel, baron dâ€™epinay?â€ asked he, although he
knew it perfectly.

â€œyes, sir,â€ replied franz. the notary bowed.

â€œi have, then, to inform you, sir, at the request of m. de villefort,
that your projected marriage with mademoiselle de villefort has changed
the feeling of m. noirtier towards his grandchild, and that he
disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her. let me
hasten to add,â€ continued he, â€œthat the testator, having only the right
to alienate a part of his fortune, and having alienated it all, the will
will not bear scrutiny, and is declared null and void.â€

â€œyes.â€ said villefort; â€œbut i warn m. dâ€™epinay, that during my life-time
my fatherâ€™s will shall never be questioned, my position forbidding any
doubt to be entertained.â€

amount of her fortune, which, however limited it may be, exceeds mine.
my family has sought consideration in this alliance with m. de
villefort; all i seek is happiness.â€ valentine imperceptibly thanked
him, while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks. â€œbesides, sir,â€ said
villefort, addressing himself to his future son-in-law, â€œexcepting the
loss of a portion of your hopes, this unexpected will need not
personally wound you; m. noirtierâ€™s weakness of mind sufficiently
explains it. it is not because mademoiselle valentine is going to marry
you that he is angry, but because she will marry, a union with any other
would have caused him the same sorrow. old age is selfish, sir, and
mademoiselle de villefort has been a faithful companion to m. noirtier,
which she cannot be when she becomes the baroness dâ€™epinay. my fatherâ€™s
melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects, which the
weakness of his mind would inca

perfectly convinced that at the present time, although, he knows that
his granddaughter is going to be married, m. noirtier has even forgotten
the name of his intended grandson.â€ m. de villefort had scarcely said
this, when the door opened, and barrois appeared.

â€œgentlemen,â€ said he, in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to
his masters under such solemn circumstances,--â€œgentlemen, m. noirtier de
villefort wishes to speak immediately to m. franz de quesnel, baron
dâ€™epinay;â€ he, as well as the notary, that there might be no mistake in
the person, gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect.

villefort started, madame de villefort let her son slip from her knees,
valentine rose, pale and dumb as a statue. albert and chÃ¢teau-renaud
exchanged a second look, more full of amazement than the first. the
notary looked at villefort. â€œit is impossible,â€ said the procureur. â€œm.

â€œit is at this moment,â€ replied barrois with the same firmness, â€œthat m.

â€œgrandpapa noirtier can speak now, then,â€ said edward, with his habitual
quickness. however, his remark did not make madame de villefort even
smile, so much was every mind engaged, and so solemn was the situation.
astonishment was at its height. something like a smile was perceptible
on madame de villefortâ€™s countenance. valentine instinctively raised her
eyes, as if to thank heaven.

â€œpray go, valentine,â€ said; m. de villefort, â€œand see what this new
fancy of your grandfatherâ€™s is.â€ valentine rose q

hastening joyfully towards the door, when m. de villefort altered his
intention.

â€œstop,â€ said he; â€œi will go with you.â€

to attend to his wish; besides, i shall be happy to pay my respects to
him, not having yet had the honor of doing so.â€

â€œpray, sir,â€ said villefort with marked uneasiness, â€œdo not disturb
yourself.â€


â€œforgive me, sir,â€ said franz in a resolute tone. â€œi would not lose this
opportunity of proving to m. noirtier how wrong it would be of him to
encourage feelings of dislike to me, which i am determined to conquer,
whatever they may be, by my devotion.â€ and

villefort he arose, and followed valentine, who was running downstairs
with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to. m.
de villefort followed them. chÃ¢teau-renaud and morcerf exchanged a third
look of still increasing wonder.



chapter 75. a signed statement

noirtier was prepared to receive them, dressed in black, and installed
in his armchair. when the three persons he expected had entered, he
looked at the door, which his valet immediately closed.

â€œlisten,â€ whispered villefort to valentine, who could not conceal her
joy; â€œif m. noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay
your marriage, i forbid you to understand him.â€ valentine blushed, but
did not answer. villefort, approaching noirtier--â€œhere is m. franz
dâ€™epinay,â€ said he; 
 
 ___________________________
 
â€œyou requested to see him. we have all wished for
this interview, and i trust it will convince you how ill-formed are your
objections to valentineâ€™s marriage.â€

noirtier answered only by a look which made villefortâ€™s blood run cold.
he motioned to valentine to approach. in a moment, thanks to her habit
of conversing with her grandfather, she understood that he asked for a
key. then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the
windows. she opened the drawer, and found a key; and, understanding that
was what he wanted, again watched his eyes, which turned toward an old
secretary which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to
contain
 
 ___________________________
 
 nothing but useless documents. â€œshall i open the secretary
desk?â€ asked valentine.

â€œyes,â€ said the old man.

â€œand the drawers?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œthose at the side?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œthe middle one?â€

â€œyes.â€ valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers. â€œis that
what you wish for?â€ asked she.

â€œno.â€

she took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was
empty. â€œbut there are no more,â€ said she. noirtierâ€™s eye was fixed on
the dictionary. â€œyes, i understand, grandfather,â€ said the young girl.


she pointed to each letter of the alphabet. at the letter s the old man
stopped her. she opened, and found the word â€œsecret.â€

â€œah, is there a secret spring?â€ said valentine.

â€œyes,â€ said noirtier.

â€œand who knows it?â€ noirtier looked at the door where the servant had
gone out. â€œbarrois?â€ said she.

â€œyes.â€

â€œshall i call him?â€

â€œyes.â€

valentine went to the door, and
 
 ___________________________
 
 called barrois. villefortâ€™s impatience
during this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead, and
franz was stupefied. the old servant came. â€œbarrois,â€ said valentine,
â€œmy grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretary desk,
but there is a secret spring in it, which you know--will you open it?â€

barrois looked at the old man. â€œobey,â€ said noirtierâ€™s intelligent eye.
barrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a
bundle of papers tied with a black string.

â€œis that what you wish for?â€ said barrois.

â€œyes.â€

â€œshall i give these papers to m. de villefort?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œto mademoiselle valentine?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œto m. franz dâ€™epinay?â€

â€œyes.â€

franz, astonished, advanced a step. â€œto me, sir?â€ said he.

â€œyes.â€ franz took them from barrois and casting a glance at the cover,
read:--

â€œâ€˜

packet to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as containing an

â€œwell, sir,â€ asked franz, â€œwhat do you wish me to do with this paper?â€

â€œto preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless,â€ said the procureur.

â€œno,â€ replied noirtier eagerly.

â€œdo you wish him to read it?â€ said valentine.

â€œyes,â€ replied the old man. â€œyou understand, baron, my grandfather
wishes you to read this paper,â€ said valentine.

â€œthen let us sit down,â€ said villefort impatiently, â€œfor it will take
some time.â€

â€œsit down,â€ said the old man. villefort took a chair, but valentine
remained standing by her fatherâ€™s side, and franz before him, holding
the mysterious paper in his hand. â€œread,â€ said the old man. franz untied
it

, and in the midst of the most profound silence read:


â€œâ€˜_extract from the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the
rue saint-jacques, held february 5th, 1815_.â€™â€

franz stopped. â€œfebruary 5th, 1815!â€ said he; â€œit is the day my father
was murdered.â€ valentine and villefort were dumb; the eye of the old man
alone seemed to say clearly, â€œgo on.â€

â€œbut it was on leaving this club,â€ said he, â€œmy father disappeared.â€
 noirtierâ€™s eye continued to say, â€œread.â€ he resumed:--

â€œâ€˜the undersigned louis jacques beaurepaire, lieutenant-colonel of
artillery, Ã©tienne duchampy, general of brigade, and claude lecharpal,
keeper of woods and forests, declare, that on the 4th of february, a
letter arrived from the island of elba, recommending to the kindness and
the confidence of the bonapartist club, general flavien de quesnel, who
having served the emperor from 1804 to 1814 was supposed to be devoted
to the interests o

â€œâ€˜â€œyou would call acting generously, knowing your conspiracy and not
informing against you, that is what i should call becoming your
accomplice. you see i am more candid than you.â€â€™â€

â€œah, my father!â€ said franz, interrupting himself. â€œi understand now why
they murdered him.â€ valentine could not help casting one glance towards
the young man, whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold.
villefort walked to and fro behind them. noirtier watched the expression
of each one, and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude. franz
returned to the manuscript, and continued:--

â€œâ€˜â€œsir,â€ said the president, â€œyou have been invited to join this
assembly--you were not forced here; it was proposed to you to come
blindfolded--you accepted. when you complied with this twofold request

we should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police. it

general tore the handkerchief from his eyes. â€œat last,â€ said he, â€œi
shall know with whom i have to do.â€ they opened the door and the four
men alighted.â€™â€

franz again interrupted himself, and wiped the cold drops from his brow;
there was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling
pallor these details of his fatherâ€™s death, which had hitherto been a
mystery. valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer. noirtier looked at
villefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride. franz
continued:--

â€œâ€˜it was, as we said, the fifth of february. for three days the mercury
had been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered
with ice. the general was stout and tall, the president offered him the
side of the railing to assist him in getting down. the two witnesses
followed. it was a dark night. the ground from the steps to the river
was covered with snow and hoarfrost, the wat

should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws

â€œâ€˜signed, beaurepaire, duchampy, and lecharpal.â€™â€

when franz had finished reading this account, so dreadful for a son;
when valentine, pale with emotion, had wiped away a tear; when
villefort, trembling, and crouched in a corner, had endeavored to lessen
the storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man,--â€œsir,â€
 said dâ€™epinay to noirtier, â€œsince you are well acquainted with all these
details, which are attested by honorable signatures,--since you appear
to take some interest in me, although you have only manifested it
hitherto by causing me sorrow, refuse me not one final satisfaction--
tell me the name of the president of the club, that i may at least know
who killed my father.â€ villefort mechanically felt for the handle of the
door; valentine, who understood sooner than anyone her grandfatherâ€™s
answer, and who had often

â€œhold, sir,â€ said villefort, â€œdo not prolong this dreadful scene. the
names have been purposely concealed; my father himself does not know who
this president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you; proper names
are not in the dictionary.â€

â€œoh, misery,â€ cried franz: â€œthe only hope which sustained me and enabled
me to read to the end was that of knowing, at least, the name of him who
killed my father! sir, sir,â€ cried he, turning to noirtier, â€œdo what you
can--make me understand in some way!â€

â€œyes,â€ replied noirtier.

â€œoh, mademoiselle,--mademoiselle!â€ cried franz, â€œyour grandfather says
he can indicate the person. help me,--lend me your assistance!â€ noirtier
looked at the dictionary. franz took it with a nervous trembling, and
repeated the letters of the alphabet successively, until he came to m.
at that letter the old man signified â€œyes.â€

â€œm,â€ repeated franz. the young manâ€™s finger, glided over the wor

ds, but
at each one noirtier answered by a negative sign. valentine hid her head
between her hands. at length, franz arrived at the word myself.


â€œyes!â€

â€œyou?â€ cried franz, whose hair stood on end; â€œyou, m. noirtier--you
killed my father?â€

â€œyes!â€ replied noirtier, fixing a majestic look on the young man. franz
fell powerless on a chair; villefort opened the door and escaped, for
the idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the
heart of this terrible old man.



chapter 76. progress of cavalcanti the younger

meanwhile m. cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service, not in
the army of his majesty the emperor of austria, but at the gaming-table
of the baths of lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous
courtiers. he had

 albert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard.
â€œcome, finish your cup of coffee,â€ said monte cristo; â€œthe history is
ended.â€



chapter 78. we hear from yanina

if valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance
of franz when he quitted the chamber of m. noirtier, even she would have
been constrained to pity him. villefort had only just given utterance to
a few incoherent sentences, and then retired to his study, where he
received about two hours afterwards the following letter:--

â€œafter all the disclosures which were made this morning, m. noirtier de
villefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed
between his family and that of m. franz dâ€™epinay. m. dâ€™epinay must say
that he is shocked and astonished that m. de villefort,
 
 ___________________________
 
 circumstances detailed this morning, should not have
anticipated him in this announcement.â€

no one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly
unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would
have supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance;
although it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would
carry candor, or rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history.
and in justice to villefort, it must be understood that m. noirtier, who
never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject, had always
omitted to explain the affair to villefort, so that he had all his life
entertained the belief that general de quesnel, or the baron dâ€™epinay,
as he was alternately styled, according as the speaker wished to
identify him by his own family name, or by the title which had been
conferred on him, fell the victim of assassination, and not that he was
killed fairly in a duel. this harsh letter, coming as it did from a man
genera
 
 ___________________________
 
lly so polite and respectful, struck a mortal blow at the pride of
villefort. hardly had he read the letter, when his wife entered. the
sudden departure of franz, after being summoned by m. noirtier, had so
much astonished everyone, that the position of madame de villefort, left
alone with the notary and the witnesses, became every moment more
embarrassing. determined to bear it no longer, she arose and left the
room; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his
sudden disappearance.

m. de villefortâ€™s communications on the subject were very limited and
concise; he told her, in fact, that an explanation had taken place
between m. noirtier, m. dâ€™epinay, and himself,
 
 ___________________________
 
 and that the marriage of
valentine and franz would consequently be broken off. this was an
awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were
waiting. she therefore contented herself with saying that m. noirtier
having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of
apoplectic fit, the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days
longer. this news, false as it was following so singularly in the train
of the two similar misfortunes which had so recently occurred, evidently
astonished the auditors, and they retired without a word. during this
time valentine, at once terrified and happy, after having embraced and
thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the
ch
 
 ___________________________
 
ain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable, asked
leave to retire to her own room, in order to recover her composure.
noirtier looked the permission which she solicited. but instead of going
to her own room, valentine, having once gained her liberty, entered the
gallery, and, opening a small door at the end of it, found herself at
once in the garden.

in the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the
other, an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of
valentineâ€™s mind. she expected every moment that she should see morrel
appear, pale and trembling, to forbid the signing of the contract,
 
 ___________________________
 
 such as he
just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day.
however, he would not leave without the promise of seeing valentine
again the next night. valentine promised all that morrel required of
her, and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she
should marry maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that
she should not marry franz.

during the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed, madame
de villefort had gone to visit m. noirtier. the old man looked at her
with that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed
to receive her.

â€œsir,â€ said she, â€œit is superfluous for me to tell you that valentineâ€™s
marriage is broken off, since it was here that the affair was
concluded.â€ noirtierâ€™s countenance remained immovable. â€œbut one thing i
can tell you, of which i do not think you are aware; that is, that i
have always been opposed to this marriage, and that the contract was
entered into entirely with
 
 ___________________________
 
out my consent or approbation.â€ noirtier
regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring an
explanation. â€œnow that this marriage, which i know you so much disliked,
is done away with, i come to you on an errand which neither m. de
villefort nor valentine could consistently undertake.â€ noirtierâ€™s eyes
demanded the nature of her mission. â€œi come to entreat you, sir,â€
 continued madame de villefort, â€œas the only one who has the right of
doing so, inasmuch as i am the only one who will receive no personal
benefit from the transaction,--i come to entreat you to restore, not
your love, for that she has always possessed, but to restore your
fortune to your granddaughter.â€

there was a doubtful expression in noirtierâ€™s eyes; he was evidently

proceeding, and he could not
succeed in doing so. â€œmay i hope, sir,â€ said madame de villefort, â€œthat
your intentions accord with my request?â€ noirtier made a sign that they
did. â€œin that case, sir,â€ rejoined madame de villefort, â€œi will leave
you overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence
to my wishes.â€ she then bowed to m. noirtier and retired.

the next day m. noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was torn up
and a second made, in which he left the whole of his fortune to
valentine, on condition that she should never be separated from him. it
was then generally reported that mademoiselle de villefort, the heiress
of the marquis and marchioness of saint-mÃ©ran, had regained the good
graces of her grandfather, and that she would ultimately be in
possession of an income of 300,000 livres.

while all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the marri

e had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his
discomfiture, as he was crossing the barrier he perceived morrel, who
was walking with a quick step and a bright eye. he was passing the
chinese baths, and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte
saint-martin, and to be going towards the madeleine. â€œah,â€ said morcerf,
â€œthere goes a happy man!â€ and it so happened albert was not mistaken in
his opinion.



chapter 79. the lemonade

morrel was, in fact, very happy. m. noirtier had just sent for him, and
he was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not
stopped to take a cab, placing infinitely more dependence on his own two
legs than on the four legs of a cab-horse. he had therefore set off at a
furious rate from the rue meslay, and was hastening with rapid strides
in the direction of the faubourg saint-honorÃ©.

morrel advanced with a firm, manly tread, and poor barrois followed him
as he best might. morrel was only thirty-one, barrois was sixt

y years of
age; morrel was deeply in love, and barrois was dying with heat and
exertion. these two men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled
two parts of a triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet
nevertheless possessing their point of union. this point of union was
noirtier, and it was he who had just sent for morrel, with the request
that the latter would lose no time in coming to him--a command which
morrel obeyed to the letter, to the great discomfiture of barrois. on
arriving at the house, morrel was not even out of breath, for love lends
wings to our desires; but barrois, who had long forgotten what it was to
love, was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to
use.

the old servant introduced morrel by a private entrance, closed the door
of

 the study, and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of
valentine. she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress,
and morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he
felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her
grandfather. but the easy-chair of the old man was heard rolling along
the floor, and he soon made his appearance in the room. noirtier
acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks
which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of
valentine and himself--an intervention which had saved them from
despair. morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the
new favor which he designed to bestow on him. valentine was sitting at a
little distance from them, timidly awaiting the moment when she should
be obliged to speak. noirtier fixed his eyes on her. â€œam i to say what
you 
 
 ___________________________
 
told me?â€ asked valentine. noirtier made a sign that she was to do
so.

â€œmonsieur morrel,â€ said valentine to the young man, who was regarding
her with the most intense interest, â€œmy grandfather, m. noirtier, had a
thousand things to say, which he told me three days ago; and now, he has
sent for you, that i may repeat them to you. i will repeat them, then;
and since he has chosen me as his interpreter, i will be faithful to the
trust, and will not alter a word of his intentions.â€

â€œoh, i am listening with the greatest impatience,â€ replied the young
man; â€œspeak, i beg of you.â€ valentine cast down her eyes; this was a
good omen for morrel, for he knew that nothing but happiness could have
t

he power of thus overcoming valentine. â€œmy grandfather intends leaving
this house,â€ said she, â€œand barrois is looking out for suitable
apartments for him in another.â€

â€œbut you, mademoiselle de villefort,--you, who are necessary to m.
noirtierâ€™s happiness----â€

â€œi?â€ interrupted valentine; â€œi shall not leave my grandfather,--that is
an understood thing between us. my apartment will be close to his. now,
m. de villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his
refusal; in the first case, i shall leave directly, and in the second, i
shall wait till i am of age, which will be in about ten months. then i
shall be free, i shall have an independent fortune, andâ€--

â€œand what?â€ demanded morrel.

â€œand with my grandfa
 
 ___________________________
 
therâ€™s consent i shall fulfil the promise which i
have made you.â€ valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low
tone, that nothing but morrelâ€™s intense interest in what she was saying
could have enabled him to hear them. â€œhave i not explained your wishes,
grandpapa?â€ said valentine, addressing noirtier. â€œyes,â€ looked the old
man.--â€œonce under my grandfatherâ€™s roof, m. morrel can visit me in the
presence of my good and worthy protector, if we still feel that the
union we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and
happiness; in that case i shall expect m. morrel to come and claim me at
my own hands. but, alas, i have heard it said that hearts inflamed by
obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security; i trust we
shall never find it so in our experience!â€

â€

œoh,â€ cried morrel, almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before
noirtier and valentine, and to adore them as two superior beings, â€œwhat
have i ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness?â€

â€œuntil that time,â€ continued the young girl in a calm and self-possessed
tone of voice, â€œwe will conform to circumstances, and be guided by the
wishes of our friends, so long as those wishes do not tend finally to
separate us; in a word, and i repeat it, because it expresses all i wish
to convey,--we will wait.â€

â€œand i swear to make all the sacrifices wh

ich this word imposes, sir,â€
 said morrel, â€œnot only with resignation, but with cheerfulness.â€

â€œtherefore,â€ continued valentine, looking playfully at maximilian, â€œno
more inconsiderate actions--no more rash projects; for you surely would
not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as
destined, honorably and happily, to bear your name?â€

morrel looked obedience to her commands. noirtier regarded the lovers
with a look of ineffable tenderness, while barrois, who had remained in
the room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that
passed, smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from
his bald forehead. â€œhow hot you look, my good barrois,â€ said valentine.

â€œah, i have been running very fast, mademoiselle, but i must do m.
morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster.â€ noirtier directed
their attention to a waiter, on which was plac

ed a decanter containing
lemonade and a glass. the decanter was nearly full, with the exception
of a little, which had been already drunk by m. noirtier.

â€œcome, barrois,â€ said the young girl, â€œtake some of this lemonade; i see
you are coveting a good draught of it.â€

â€œthe fact is, mademoiselle,â€ said barrois, â€œi am dying with thirst, and
since you are so kind as to offer it me, i cannot say i should at all
object to drinking your health in a glass of it.â€

â€œtake some, then, and come back immediately.â€ barrois took away the
waiter, and hardly was he outside the door, which in his haste he forgot
to shut, than they saw him th

row back his head and empty to the very
dregs the glass which valentine had filled. valentine and morrel were
exchanging their adieux in the presence of noirtier when a ring was
heard at the door-bell. it was the signal of a visit. valentine looked
at her watch.

â€œit is past noon,â€ said she, â€œand today is saturday; i dare say it is
the doctor, grandpapa.â€ noirtier looked his conviction that she was
right in her supposition. â€œhe will come in here, and m. morrel had
better go,--do you not think so, grandpapa?â€

â€œyes,â€ signed the old man.

â€œbarrois,â€ cried valentine, â€œbarrois!â€


â€œi am coming, mademoiselle,â€ replied he.

â€œbarrois will open the door for you,â€ said valentine, addressing morrel.
â€œand now remember one thing, monsieur officer, that my grandfather
commands you not to take any rash or ill-advised step which would be

 if he would fall.

â€œwhat is the matter, barrois?â€ said valentine. the old man did not
answer, but looked at his master with wild staring eyes, while with his
cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand
upright. â€œhe is going to fall!â€ cried morrel. the rigors which had
attacked barrois gradually increased, the features of the face became
quite altered, and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to
indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder. noirtier,
seeing barrois in this pitiable condition, showed by his looks all the
various emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of
man. barrois made some steps towards his master.

â€œah, sir,â€ said he, â€œtell me what is the matter with me. i am suffering-
-i cannot see. a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain. ah, donâ€™t
touch me, pray donâ€™t.â€ by this time his haggard eyes had the appearance
of being ready to start from their sockets; his head fell back, and the
lower

extremities of the body began to stiffen. valentine uttered a cry
of horror; morrel took her in his arms, as if to defend her from some
unknown danger. â€œm. dâ€™avrigny, m. dâ€™avrigny,â€ cried she, in a stifled
voice. â€œhelp, help!â€ barrois turned round and with a great effort
stumbled a few steps, then fell at the feet of noirtier, and resting his
hand on the knee of the invalid, exclaimed, â€œmy master, my good master!â€
 at this moment m. de villefort, attracted by the noise, appeared on the
threshold. morrel relaxed his hold of valentine, and retreating to a
distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain. pale
as if he had been gazing on a serpent, he fixed his terrified eye on the
agonized sufferer.

noirtier, burning with impatience and terror, was in despair at his
utter inability to help his old

â€œcome quick, quick!--and bring your bottle of
smelling-salts with you.â€

â€œwhat is the matter?â€ said madame de villefort in a harsh and
constrained tone.

â€œoh, come, come!â€

â€œbut where is the doctor?â€ exclaimed villefort; â€œwhere is he?â€ madame de
villefort now deliberately descended the staircase. in one hand she held
her handkerchief, with which she appeared to be wiping her face, and in
the other a bottle of english smelling-salts. her first look on entering
the room was at noirtier, whose face, independent of the emotion which
such a scene could not fail of producing, proclaimed him to be in
possession of his usual health; her second glance was at the dying man.
she turned pale, and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested
on the master.

â€œin the name of heaven, madame,â€ said villefort, â€œwhere is the doctor?
he was with you just now. you see this is a fit of apoplexy, and he
might be saved if he could but be bled!â€

â€œhas he eaten anything lately?â€ as

 â€œmadame,â€ replied valentine, â€œhe has not even
breakfasted. he has been running very fast on an errand with which my
grandfather charged him, and when he returned, took nothing but a glass
of lemonade.â€

â€œah,â€ said madame de villefort, â€œwhy did he not take wine? lemonade was
a very bad thing for him.â€

â€œgrandpapaâ€™s bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side; poor
barrois was very thirsty, and was thankful to drink anything he could
find.â€ madame de villefort started. noirtier looked at her with a glance
of the most profound scrutiny. â€œhe has such a short neck,â€ said she.
â€œmadame,â€ said villefort, â€œi ask where is m. dâ€™avrigny? in godâ€™s name
answer me!â€

â€œhe is with edward, who is not quite well,â€ replied madame de villefort,
no longer being able to avoid answering.

villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him. â€œtake this,â€ said madame de
villefort, giving her smelling-bottle to valentine. â€œthey will, no
doubt, bleed him; therefore i will retire,

for i cannot endure the sight

from his hiding-place, where he had remained quite unperceived, so great
had been the general confusion. â€œgo away as quick as you can,
maximilian,â€ said valentine, â€œand stay till i send for you. go.â€

morrel looked towards noirtier for permission to retire. the old man,
who had preserved all his usual coolness, made a sign to him to do so.
the young man pressed valentineâ€™s hand to his lips, and then left the
house by a back staircase. at the same moment that he quitted the room,
villefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door. barrois was now
showing signs of returning consciousness. the crisis seemed past, a low
moaning was heard, and he raised himself on one knee. dâ€™avrigny and
villefort laid him on a couch. â€

â€œdo you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œany noise in the ears?â€

â€œfrightful.â€


â€œwhen did you first feel that?â€

â€œjust now.â€

â€œsuddenly?â€

â€œyes, like a clap of thunder.â€

â€œdid you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?â€

â€œnothing.â€

â€œno drowsiness?â€

â€œnone.â€

â€œwhat have you eaten today?â€

â€œi have eaten nothing; i only drank a glass of my masterâ€™s lemonade--
thatâ€™s all;â€ and barrois turned towards noirtier, who, immovably fixed
in his armchair, was contemplating this terrible scene without allowing
a word or a movement to escape him.

â€œwhere is this lemonade?â€ asked the doctor eagerly.

â€œdownstairs in the decanter.â€

â€œwhereabouts downstairs?â€

â€œin the kitchen.â€

â€œshall i go and fetch it, doctor?â€ inquired villefort.

â€œno, stay here and try to make barrois drink the rest of this glass of
ether and water. i will go myself and fetch the lemonade.â€ dâ€™avrigny

 room. â€œis this
the decanter you spoke of?â€ asked dâ€™avrigny.

â€œyes, doctor.â€

â€œis this the same lemonade of which you partook?â€

â€œi believe so.â€

â€œwhat did it taste like?â€

â€œit had a bitter taste.â€

the doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand,
put his lips to it, and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when
he is tasting wine, he spat the liquor into the fireplace.

â€œit is no doubt the same,â€ said he. â€œdid you drink some too, m.
noirtier?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œand did you also discover a bitter taste?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œoh, doctor,â€ cried barrois, â€œthe fit is coming on again. oh, do
something for me.â€ the doctor flew to his patient. â€œthat emetic,
villefort--see if it is coming.â€ villefort sprang into the passage,
exclaiming, â€œthe emetic! the emetic!--is it come yet?â€ no one answered.
the most profound terror reigned throughout the house. â€œif i had

pen!â€ said the doctor. there was one lying on the table; he
endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient, who, in the
midst of his convulsions, was making vain attempts to vomit; but the
jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them. this second
attack was much more violent than the first, and he had slipped from the
couch to the ground, where he was writhing in agony. the doctor left him
in this paroxysm, knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it, and,
going up to noirtier, said abruptly, â€œhow do you find yourself?--well?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œhave you any weight on the chest; or does your stomach feel light and
comfortable--eh?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œthen you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the
dose which i am accustomed to give you every sunday?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œdid barrois make your lemonade?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwas it you who asked him to drink some of it?â€

€œit was your granddaughter, then, was it not?â€

â€œyes.â€ a groan from barrois, accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack
the very jawbones, attracted the attention of m. dâ€™avrigny; he left m.
noirtier, and returned to the sick man. â€œbarrois,â€ said the doctor, â€œcan
you speak?â€ barrois muttered a few unintelligible words. â€œtry and make
an effort to do so, my good man.â€ said dâ€™avrigny. barrois reopened his
bloodshot eyes. â€œwho made the lemonade?â€

â€œi did.â€

â€œdid you bring it to your master directly it was made?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œyou left it somewhere, then, in the meantime?â€

â€œyes; i left it in the pantry, because i was called away.â€

â€œwho brought it into this ro

shall i suffer like this long?â€

â€œno, no, friend,â€ replied the doctor, â€œyou will soon cease to suffer.â€

â€œah, i understand you,â€ said the unhappy man. â€œmy god, have mercy upon
me!â€ and, uttering a fearful cry, barrois fell back as if he had been
struck by lightning. dâ€™avrigny put his hand to his heart, and placed a
glass before his lips.

â€œwell?â€ said villefort. â€œgo to the kitchen and get me some syrup of
violets.â€ villefort went immediately. â€œdo not be alarmed, m. noirtier,â€
 said dâ€™avrigny; â€œi am going to take my patient into the next room to
bleed him; this sort of attack is very frightful to witness.â€

and taking barrois under the arms, he dragged him into an adjoining
room; but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade. noirtier
closed his right eye. â€œyou want valentine, do you not? i will tell them
to send her to you.â€ villefort returned, and dâ€™avrigny met him in the
passage. â€œwell, how is he now?â€ asked he. â€œcome in here,â€ s

s-paper, but, see, here they come with
the syrup of violets.â€

the doctor was right; steps were heard in the passage. m. dâ€™avrigny
opened the door, and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which
contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup, he then carefully closed
the door. â€œlook,â€ said he to the procureur, whose heart beat so loudly
that it might almost be heard, â€œhere is in this cup some syrup of
violets, and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of
which m. noirtier and barrois partook. if the lemonade be pure and
inoffensive, the syrup will retain its color; if, on the contrary, the
lemonade be drugged with poison, the syrup will become green. look
closely!â€

the doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the
decanter into the cup, and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began
to form at the bottom of the cup; this sediment first took a blue shade,
then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal, and from opal
to emerald. arri

â€œoh, man,â€ murmured dâ€™avrigny, â€œthe most selfish of all animals, the
most personal of all creatures, who believes the earth turns, the sun
shines, and death strikes for him alone,--an ant cursing god from the
top of a blade of grass! and have those who have lost their lives lost
nothing?--m. de saint-mÃ©ran, madame de saint-mÃ©ran, m. noirtier----â€

â€œhow? m. noirtier?â€

â€œyes; think you it was the poor servantâ€™s life was coveted? no, no; like
shakespeareâ€™s â€˜polonius,â€™ he died for another. it was noirtier the
lemonade was intended for--it is noirtier, logically speaking, who drank
it. the other drank it only by accident, and, although barrois is dead,
it was noirtier whose death was wished for.â€

â€œbut why did it not kill my father?â€

chapter 93. valentine

we may easily conceive where morrelâ€™s appointment was. on leaving monte
cristo he walked slowly towards villefortâ€™s; we say slowly, for morrel
had more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps, but he had
hastened to take leave of monte cristo because he wished to be alone
with his thoughts. he knew his time well--the hour when valentine was
giving noirtier his breakfast, and was sure not to be disturbed in the
performance of this pious duty. noirtier and valentine had given him
leave to go twice a week, and he was now availing himself of that
permission. he had arrived; valentine was expecting him. uneasy and
almost crazed, she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather. this
uneasiness, amounting almost to frenzy, arose from the report morcerfâ€™s
adventure had made in the world, for the affair at the opera was
generally known. no one at vil

 his footstool,--â€œnow let us talk
about our own affairs. you know, maximilian, grandpapa once thought of
leaving this house, and taking an apartment away from m. de
villefortâ€™s.â€

â€œyes,â€ said maximilian, â€œi recollect the project, of which i highly
approved.â€

â€œwell,â€ said valentine, â€œyou may approve again, for grandpapa is again
thinking of it.â€

â€œbravo,â€ said maximilian.


â€œand do you know,â€ said valentine, â€œwhat reason grandpapa gives for
leaving this house.â€ noirtier looked at valentine to impose silence, but
she did not notice him; her looks, her eyes, her smile, were all for
morrel.

â€œoh, whatever may be m. noirtierâ€™s reason,â€ answered morrel, â€œi can
readily believe it to be a good one.â€

â€œan excellent one,â€ said valentine. â€œhe pretends the air of the faubourg
saint-honorÃ© is not good for me.â€

â€œindeed?â€ said morrel; â€œin that m. noirtier may be right; you have not
seemed to be well for the last fortnight.â€

â€œnot very,â€ said

valentine. â€œand grandpapa has become my physician, and
i have the greatest confidence in him, because he knows everything.â€

â€œdo you then really suffer?â€ asked morrel quickly.

â€œoh, it must not be called suffering; i feel a general uneasiness, that
is all. i have lost my appetite, and my stomach feels as if it were
struggling to get accustomed to something.â€ noirtier did not lose a word
of what valentine said. â€œand what treatment do you adopt for this
singular complaint?â€

â€œa very simple one,â€ said valentine. â€œi swallow every morning a spoonful
of the mixture prepared for my grandfather. when i say one spoonful, i
began by one--now i take four. grandpapa says it is a panacea.â€
 valentine smiled, but it was evident that she suffered.

maximilian, in his devotedness, gazed silently at her. she was very
beautiful, but her usual pallor had increased

mother-of-pearl, now more resembled wax, to which time was adding a
yellowish hue. from valentine the young man looked towards noirtier. the
latter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl, absorbed
by her affection, and he also, like morrel, followed those traces of
inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer
that they escaped the notice of everyone but the grandfather and the
lover.

â€œbut,â€ said morrel, â€œi thought this mixture, of which you now take four
spoonfuls, was prepared for m. noirtier?â€

â€œi know it is very bitter,â€ said valentine; â€œso bitter, that all i drink

sign that he wished to speak. valentine rose to fetch the dictionary.
noirtier watched her with evident anguish. in fact, the blood was
rushing to the young girlâ€™s head already, her cheeks were becoming red.
â€œoh,â€ cried she, without losing any of her cheerfulness, â€œthis is
singular! i canâ€™t see! did the sun shine in my eyes?â€ and she leaned
against the window.

â€œthe sun is not shining,â€ said morrel, more alarmed by noirtierâ€™s
expression than by valentineâ€™s indisposition. he ran towards her. the
young girl smiled. â€œcheer up,â€ said she to noirtier. â

€œdo not be alarmed,
maximilian; it is nothing, and has already passed away. but listen! do i
not hear a carriage in the courtyard?â€ she opened noirtierâ€™s door, ran
to a window in the passage, and returned hastily. â€œyes,â€ said she, â€œit
is madame danglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us. good-
bye;--i must run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather,
farewell till i see you again. stay with grandpapa, maximilian; i
promise you not to persuade them to stay.â€


morrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little
staircase which led both to madame de villefortâ€™s apartments and to
hers. as soon

 as she was gone, noirtier made a sign to morrel to take
the dictionary. morrel obeyed; guided by valentine, he had learned how
to understand the old man quickly. accustomed, however, as he was to the
work, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find
every word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before the
thought of the old man was translated by these words, â€œfetch the glass
of water and the decanter from valentineâ€™s room.â€

morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken barr

returned. the decanter and the glass were completely empty. noirtier
made a sign that he wished to speak. â€œwhy are the glass and decanter
empty?â€ asked he; â€œvalentine said she only drank half the glassful.â€ the
translation of this new question occupied another five minutes. â€œi do
not know,â€ said the servant, â€œbut the housemaid is in mademoiselle
valentineâ€™s room: perhaps she has emptied them.â€

â€œask her,â€ said morrel, translating noirtierâ€™s thought this time by his
look. the servant went out, but returned almost immediately.

what remained in the glass; as for the decanter, master edward had
emptied that to make a pond for his ducks.â€ noirtier raised his eyes to
heaven, as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke. from that
moment the old manâ€™s eyes were fixed on the door, and did not quit it.

it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen;
they had been ushered into madame de villefortâ€™s room, who had said she
would receive them there. that is why valentine passed through her room,
which was on a level with valentineâ€™s, and only separated from it by
edwardâ€™s. the two ladies entered the drawing

monte cristo at the opera yesterday, he apologized on the ground today.â€

â€œimpossible,â€ said madame de villefort.

â€œah, my dear friend,â€ said madame danglars, with the same simplicity we
before noticed, â€œit is a fact. i heard it from m. debray, who was
present at the explanation.â€ valentine also knew the truth, but she did
not answer. a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her
in m. noirtierâ€™s room. deeply engaged with a sort of inward
contemplation, valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the
conversation. she would, indeed, have found it impossible to repeat what
had been said the last few minutes, when suddenly madame danglarsâ€™ hand,
pressed on her arm, aroused her from her lethargy.

â€œwhat is it?â€ said she, starting at madame danglarsâ€™ touch as she would
have done from an electric shock.

â€œit is, my dear valentine,â€ said the baroness, â€œthat you are, doubtle

bottom of the stairs. quick as a flash, he raised her in his arms and
placed her in a chair. valentine opened her eyes.

â€œoh, what a clumsy thing i am,â€ said she with feverish volubility; â€œi
donâ€™t know my way. i forgot there were three more steps before the
landing.â€

â€œyou have hurt yourself, perhaps,â€ said morrel. â€œwhat can i do for you,
valentine?â€ valentine looked around her; she saw the deepest terror
depicted in noirtierâ€™s eyes. â€œdonâ€™t worry, dear grandpapa,â€ said she,
endeavoring to smile; â€œit is nothing--it is nothing; i was giddy, that
is all.â€

â€œanother attack of giddiness,â€ said morrel, clasping his hands. â€œoh,
attend to it, valentine, i entreat you.â€

â€œbut no,â€ said valentine,--â€œno, i tell you it is all past, and it was
nothing. now, let me tell you some news; eugÃ©nie is to be married in a
week, and in three days there is to be a grand feast, a betrothal
festival. we are all inv

y of grandpapa?â€

â€œyes,â€ cried morrel, â€œmake haste. so long as you are not mine,
valentine, i shall always think i may lose you.â€

â€œoh,â€ replied valentine with a convulsive movement, â€œoh, indeed,
maximilian, you are too timid for an officer, for a soldier who, they
say, never knows fear. ha, ha, ha!â€

she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh, her arms stiffened and
twisted, her head fell back on her chair, and she remained motionless.
the cry of terror which was stopped on noirtierâ€™s lips, seemed to start
from his eyes. morrel understood it; he knew he must call assistance.
the young man rang the bell violently; the housemaid who had been in
mademoiselle valentineâ€™s room, and the servant who had replaced barrois,
ran in at the same moment. valentine was so pale, so cold, so inanimate
that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with
the fear which pervaded that house, and they flew into the passage
crying for help. madame danglars and eugÃ©nie were

chapter 94. maximilianâ€™s avowal

at the same moment m. de villefortâ€™s voice was heard calling from his
study, â€œwhat is the matter?â€ morrel looked at noirtier who had recovered
his self-command, and with a glance indicated the closet where once
before under somewhat similar circumstances, he had taken refuge. he had
only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet
when the procureurâ€™s footstep was heard in the passage. villefort sprang
into the room, ran to valentine, and took her in his arms. â€œa physician,
a physician,--m. dâ€™avrigny!â€ cried villefort; â€œor rather i will go for
him myself.â€ he flew from the apartment,

baptistin, whom he saw in the rue matignon, and who was running.

meanwhile, villefort and dâ€™avrigny had made all possible haste,
valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival, and
the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances
demanded, and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret
intensified twofold. villefort, closely watching his countenance and his
lips, awaited the result of the examination. noirtier, paler than even
the young girl, more eager than villefort for the decision, was watching
also intently and affectionately. at last dâ€™avrigny slowly uttered these
words:--â€œshe is still alive!â€

â€œstill?â€ cried villefort; â€œoh, doctor, what a dreadful word is that.â€

â€œyes,â€ said the physician, â€œi repeat it; she is still alive, and i am
astonished at it.â€

â€œbut is she safe?â€ asked the father.

â€œyes, since she lives.â€ at that moment dâ€™avrignyâ€™s glance met noirtierâ€

eye. it glistened with such extraordinary joy, so rich and full of
thought, that the physician was struck. he placed the young girl again
on the chair,--her lips were scarcely discernible, they were so pale and
white, as well as her whole face,--and remained motionless, looking at
noirtier, who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did. â€œsir,â€ said
dâ€™avrigny to villefort, â€œcall mademoiselle valentineâ€™s maid, if you
please.â€ villefort went himself to find her; and dâ€™avrigny approached
noirtier. â€œhave you something to tell me?â€ asked he. the old man winked
his eyes expressively, which we may remember was his only way of
expressing his approval.

â€œprivately?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwell, i will remain with you.â€ at this moment villefort returned,
followed by the

â€œwhat is the matter, then, with this dear child? she has just left me,
and she complained of being indisposed, but i did not think seriously of
it.â€ the young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection
of a true mother, approached valentine and took her hand. dâ€™avrigny
continued to look at noirtier; he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and
become round, his cheeks turn pale and tremble; the perspiration stood
in drops upon his forehead. â€œah,â€ said he, involuntarily following
noirtierâ€™s eyes, which were fixed on madame de villefort, who repeated,-
-â€œthis poor child would be better in bed. come, fanny, we will put her
to bed.â€ m. dâ€™avrigny, who saw that would be a means of his remaining
alone with noirtier, expressed his opinion that it was the best thing
that could be done; bu

power to give one parting look to her grandfather, who in losing her
seemed to be resigning his very soul. dâ€™avrigny followed the invalid,
wrote a prescription, ordered villefort to take a cabriolet, go in
person to a chemistâ€™s to get the prescribed medicine, bring it himself,
and wait for him in his daughterâ€™s room. then, having renewed his
injunction not to give valentine anything, he went down again to
noirtier, shut the doors carefully, and after convincing himself that no
one was listening,--â€œdo you,â€ said he, â€œknow anything of this young
ladyâ€™s illness?â€

â€œyes,â€ said the old man.

â€œwe have no time to lose; i will question, and do you answer me.â€
 noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer. â€œdid you anticipate
the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?â€

â€œyes.â€ dâ€™avrigny reflected a moment; then approaching noirtier,--â€œpardon

 added he, â€œbut no indication should be
neglected in this terrible situation. did you see poor barrois die?â€
 noirtier raised his eyes to heaven. â€œdo you know of what he died!â€ asked
dâ€™avrigny, placing his hand on noirtierâ€™s shoulder.

â€œyes,â€ replied the old man.

â€œdo you think he died a natural death?â€ a sort of smile was discernible
on the motionless lips of noirtier.

â€œthen you have thought that barrois was poisoned?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œdo you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œdo you think the same hand which unintentionally struck barrois has now
attacked valentine?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œthen will she die too?â€ asked dâ€™avrigny, fixing his penetrating gaze on
noirtier. he watched the effect of this question on the old man. â€œno,â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwhat do you hope?â€ the old man made him understand with his eyes that
he could not answer. â€œah, yes, it is true,â€ murmured dâ€™avrigny. then,
turning to noirtier,--â€œdo you hope the assassin will be tried?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œthen you hope the poison will take no effect on valentine?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œit is no news to you,â€ added dâ€™avrigny, â€œto tell you that an attempt
has been made to poison her?â€ the old man made a sign that he
entertained no doubt upon the subject. â€œthen how do you hope valentine
will escape?â€ noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot.

 said dâ€™avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, â€œhas it occurred to youâ€--

to resist poison?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œyes, yes, yes,â€ said noirtier, delighted to be understood.

â€œof course. i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give

â€œyes.â€

â€œand by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to
neutralize the effect of a similar poison?â€ noirtierâ€™s joy continued.
â€œand you have succeeded,â€ exclaimed dâ€™avrigny. â€œwithout that precaution
valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured.

him. but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the
same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of
health. indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and confused
forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented themselves before
her eyes.

during the daytime valentineâ€™s perceptions remained tolerably clear,
owing to the constant presence of m. noirtier, who caused himself to be
carried to his granddaughterâ€™s room, and watched her with his paternal
tenderness; villefort also, on his return from the law courts,
frequently passed an hour or two with his father and child. at six
oâ€™clock villefort retired to his study, at eight m. dâ€™avrigny himself
arrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl, and
then m. noirtier was carried away. a nurse of the doctorâ€™s choice
succeeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven oâ€

valentine was asleep. as she went downstairs she gave the keys of
valentineâ€™s room to m. de villefort, so that no one could reach the
sick-room excepting through that of madame de villefort and little
edward.

every morning morrel called on noirtier to receive news of valentine,
and, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.
certainly, though valentine still labored under dreadful nervous
excitement, she was better; and moreover, monte cristo had told him
when, half distracted, he had rushed to the countâ€™s house, that if she
were not dead in two hours she would be saved. now four days had
elapsed, and valentine still lived.

the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued valentine even in her
sleep, or rather in that

hen morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes
mere strangers, like the count of monte cristo came to visit her; even
the very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and
this state lasted till about three oâ€™clock in the morning, when a deep,
heavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake till
daylight. on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of
the flight of eugÃ©nie and the arrest of benedetto,--villefort having
retired as well as noirtier and dâ€™avrigny,--her thoughts wandered in a
confused maze, alternately reviewing her own situation and the events
she had just heard.

eleven oâ€™clock had struck. the nurse, having placed the beverage
prepared by the doctor within reach of the patient, and locked the door,
was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the
kitchen, and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had
for some months past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the
house of the king

repeated the young girl. â€œyes,â€ repeated the count.

â€œwhat you tell me is horrible, sir. you wish to make me believe
something too dreadful. what?--attempt to murder me in my fatherâ€™s
house, in my room, on my bed of sickness? oh, leave me, sir; you are
tempting me--you make me doubt the goodness of providence--it is
impossible, it cannot be!â€

â€œare you the first that this hand has stricken? have you not seen m. de
saint-mÃ©ran, madame de saint-mÃ©ran, barrois, all fall? would not m.
noirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has been
pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the
poison?â€

â€œoh, heaven,â€ said valentine; â€œis this the reason why grandpapa has made
me share all his beverages during the last month?â€

â€œand have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of
dried orange-peel?â€

â€œoh, yes, yes!â€

â€œthen that explains all,â€ said monte cristo. â€œyour grandfather knows,
then, that a poisoner lives here; perh

â€œbut,â€ exclaimed the young girl, â€œwhy am i thus pursued?â€

â€œwhy?--are you so kind--so good--so unsuspicious of ill, that you cannot
understand, valentine?â€

â€œno, i have never injured her.â€

â€œbut you are rich, valentine; you have 200,000 livres a year, and you
prevent her son from enjoying these 200,000 livres.â€

â€œhow so? the fortune is not her gift, but is inherited from my
relations.â€

â€œcertainly; and that is why m. and madame de saint-mÃ©ran have died; that
is why m. noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir; that is
why you, in your turn, are to die--it is because your father would
inherit your property, and your brother, his only son, succeed to his.â€

â€œedward? poor child! are all these crimes committed on his account?â€

â€œah, then you at length understand?â€

â€œheaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!â€

â€œvalentine, you are an angel!â€

â€œbut why is my grandfather allowed to live?â€

â€œit was considered, that you dead, the for

â€œsince she is dead.â€

â€œdead,--dead!â€ groaned forth villefort, in a paroxysm of grief, which
was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron
heart of that man.

â€œdead!â€ repeated a third voice. â€œwho said valentine was dead?â€

the two men turned round, and saw morrel standing at the door, pale and
terror-stricken. this is what had happened. at the usual time, morrel
had presented himself at the little door leading to noirtierâ€™s room.
contrary to custom, the door was open, and having no occasion to ring he
entered. he waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to
conduct him to m. noirtier; but no one answered, the servants having, as
we know, deserted the house. morrel had no particular reason for
uneasiness; monte cristo had promised him that valentine should live,
and so far he had always fulfilled his word. every night the count had
given him news, which was the next morning confirmed by noirtier.
 
 ___________________________
 
 still
this extraordinary silence appeared strange to him, and he called a
second and third time; still no answer. then he determined to go up.
noirtierâ€™s room was opened, like all the rest. the first thing he saw
was the old man sitting in his armchair in his usual place, but his eyes
expressed alarm, which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his
features.

â€œhow are you, sir?â€ asked morrel, with a sickness of heart.

â€œwell,â€ answered the old man, by closing his eyes; but his appearance
manifested increasing uneasiness.

â€œyou are thoughtful, sir,â€ continued morrel; â€œyou want something; shall
i call one of the servants?â
 
 ___________________________
 
€

â€œyes,â€ replied noirtier.

morrel pulled the bell, but though he nearly broke the cord no one
answered. he turned towards noirtier; the pallor and anguish expressed
on his countenance momentarily increased.

â€œoh,â€ exclaimed morrel, â€œwhy do they not come? is anyone ill in the
house?â€ the eyes of noirtier seemed as though they would start from
their sockets. â€œwhat is the matter? you alarm me. valentine? valentine?â€

â€œyes, yes,â€ signed noirtier. maximilian tried to speak, but he could
articulate nothing; he staggered, and supported himself against the
wainscot. then he pointed to the door.


â€œyes, yes, yes!â€ continued the old man. maximilian rushed up the little
staircase, while noirtierâ€™s eyes seemed to say,--â€œquicker, quicker!â€

in a minute the young man darted through several rooms, till at length
he reached valentineâ€™s. there was no occasion to push the door, it was
wide open. a sob was the only sound he heard. he saw 
 
 ___________________________
 
wo men; he opened his
mouth to speak, but finding it impossible to give utterance to the
innumerable ideas that occupied his brain, he went out, thrusting his
hands through his hair in such a manner that villefort and dâ€™avrigny,
for a moment diverted from the engrossing topic, exchanged glances,
which seemed to say,--â€œhe is mad!â€

but in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an
extraordinary weight. morrel was seen carrying, with superhuman
strength, the armchair containing noirtier upstairs. when he reached the
landing he placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into
valentineâ€™s room. this could only have been accomplished by means of
unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement. but the most fearful
spectacle was noirtier being pushed towards the bed, his face expressing
all his meaning, and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty.
that pale face and flaming glance appeared to villefort like a frightful
apparition. each time he had been b
 
 ___________________________
 
rought into contact with his father,
something terrible had happened. â€œsee what they have done!â€ cried
morrel, with one hand leaning on the back of the chair, and the other
extended towards valentine. â€œsee, my father, see!â€

villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who,
almost a stranger to him, called noirtier his father. at this moment the
whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became
bloodshot; the veins of the throat swelled; his cheeks and temples
became purple, as though he was struck with epilepsy; nothing was
wanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry. and the cry issued
from his pores, if we may thus speak--a cry frightful in its silence.
dâ€™avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful
restorative.

â€œsir,â€ cried morrel, seizing the moist 
 
 ___________________________
 
hand of the paralytic, â€œthey ask
me who i am, and what right i have to be here. oh, you know it, tell
them, tell them!â€ and the young manâ€™s voice was choked by sobs. as for
the old man, his chest heaved with his panting respiration. one could
have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death. at
length, happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping, tears
glistened in the eyes of noirtier. â€œtell them,â€ said morrel in a hoarse
voice, â€œtell them that i am her betrothed. tell them she was my beloved,
my noble girl, my only blessing in the world. tell them--oh, tell them,
that corpse belongs to me!â€

the young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish, fell heavily on
his knees before the bed, which his fingers grasped with convulsive
energy. dâ€™avrigny, unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion,
turned away; and villefort, without seeking any further explanation

on one knee,
his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt--â€œyou
are mistaken; valentine, dying as she has, not only requires a priest,
but an avenger. _you_, m. de villefort, send for the priest; _i_ will be
the avenger.â€

â€œwhat do you mean, sir?â€ asked villefort, trembling at the new idea
inspired by the delirium of morrel.

â€œi tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned
sufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office.â€

the eyes of noirtier glistened, and dâ€™avrigny approached.

â€œgentlemen,â€ said morrel, reading all that passed through the minds of
the witnesses to the scene, â€œi know what i am saying, and you know as
well as i do what i am about to say--valentine has been assassinated!â€
 villefort hung his head, dâ€™avrigny approached nearer, and noirtier said
â€œyesâ€ with his eyes. â€œnow, sir,â€ continued morrel, â€œin these days no one
can disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to
the cause

of her disappearance, even were she not a young, beautiful,
and adorable creature like valentine. mr. procureur,â€ said morrel with
increasing vehemence, â€œno mercy is allowed; i denounce the crime; it is
your place to seek the assassin.â€ the young manâ€™s implacable eyes
interrogated villefort, who, on his side, glanced from noirtier to
dâ€™avrigny. but instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor and
his father, he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of
maximilian. â€œyes,â€ indicated the old man.

â€œassuredly,â€ said dâ€™avrigny.

â€œsir,â€ said villefort, striving to struggle against this triple force
and his own emotion,--â€œsir, you are deceived; no one commits crimes
here. i am stricken by fate. it is horrible, indeed, but no one
assassinates.â€

the eyes of noirtier lighted up with rage, and dâ

€™avrigny prepared to
speak. morrel, however, extended his arm, and commanded silence. â€œand i
say that murders _are_ committed here,â€ said morrel, whose voice, though
lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: â€œi tell you that
this is the fourth victim within the last four months. i tell you,
valentineâ€™s life was attempted by poison four days ago, though she
escaped, owing to the precautions of m. noirtier. i tell you that the
dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time it has
succeeded. i tell you that you know these things as well as i do, since
this gentleman has forewarned you, both as a doctor and as a friend.â€

â€œoh, you rave, sir,â€ exclaimed villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape
the net in which he was taken.


â€œi rave?â€ said morrel; â€œwell, then, i appeal to m. dâ€™avrigny himself.

knees by the side of the bed.

then dâ€™avrigny spoke. â€œand i, too,â€ he exclaimed in a low voice, â€œi
unite with m. morrel in demanding justice for crime; my blood boils at
the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession.â€

â€œoh, merciful heavens!â€ murmured villefort. morrel raised his head, and
reading the eyes of the old man, which gleamed with unnatural lustre,--
â€œstay,â€ he said, â€œm. noirtier wishes to speak.â€

â€œyes,â€ indicated noirtier, with an expression the more terrible, from
all his faculties being centred in his glance.

â€œdo you know the assassin?â€ asked morrel.

â€œyes,â€ replied noirtier.

â€œand will you direct us?â€ exclaimed the young man. â€œlisten, m.
dâ€™avrigny, listen!â€ noirtier looked upon morrel with one of those
melancholy smiles which had so often made valentine happy, and thus
fixed his attention. then, having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor

n his own, he glanced towards the door.

â€œdo you wish me to leave?â€ said morrel, sadly.

â€œyes,â€ replied noirtier.

â€œalas, alas, sir, have pity on me!â€

the old manâ€™s eyes remained fixed on the door.

â€œmay i, at least, return?â€ asked morrel.

â€œyes.â€

â€œmust i leave alone?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œwhom am i to take with me? the procureur?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œthe doctor?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œyou wish to remain alone with m. de villefort?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œbut can he understand you?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œoh,â€ said villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that the
inquiries were to be made by him alone,

--â€œoh, be satisfied, i can
understand my father.â€ dâ€™avrigny took the young manâ€™s arm, and led him
out of the room. a more than deathlike silence then reigned in the
house. at the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep was
heard, and villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where
dâ€™avrigny and morrel had been staying, one absorbed in meditation, the
other in grief. â€œyou can come,â€ he said, and led them back to noirtier.
morrel looked attentively on villefort. his face was livid, large drops
rolled down his face, and in his fingers he held the fragments of a
quill pen which he had torn to atoms.

â€œgentlemen,â€ he said in a hoarse voice, â€œgive me your word of honor that
this horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves!â€ the
two men drew back.

â€œi entreat you----â€ continued villefort.

â€œbut,â€ said morrel, â€œthe culprit--the murderer--the assassin.â€

father has revealed the culpritâ€™s name; my father thirsts for revenge as
much as you do, yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this secret. do
you not, father?â€

â€œyes,â€ resolutely replied noirtier. morrel suffered an exclamation of
horror and surprise to escape him. â€œoh, sir,â€ said villefort, arresting
maximilian by the arm, â€œif my father, the inflexible man, makes this
request, it is because he knows, be assured, that valentine will be
terribly revenged. is it not so, father?â€ the old man made a sign in the
affirmative. villefort continued: â€œhe knows me, and i have pledged my
word to him. rest assured, gentlemen, that within three days, in a less
time than justice would demand

murder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble;â€
 and as he spoke these words he ground his teeth, and grasped the old
manâ€™s senseless hand.

â€œwill this promise be fulfilled, m. noirtier?â€ asked morrel, while
dâ€™avrigny looked inquiringly.

â€œyes,â€ replied noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.

â€œswear, then,â€ said villefort, joining the hands of morrel and
dâ€™avrigny, â€œswear that you will spare the honor of my house, and leave
me to avenge my child.â€ dâ€™avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble
â€œyes,â€ but morrel, disengaging his hand, rushed to the bed, and after
having pressed the cold lips of valentine with his own, hurriedly left,
uttering a long, deep groan of despair and anguish. we have before
stated that all the servants h

obliged to request m. dâ€™avrigny to superintend all the arrangements

such suspicious circumstances.

it was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair
of noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks. villefort
retired to his study, and dâ€™avrigny left to summon the doctor of the
mayoralty, whose office it is to examine bodies after decease, and who
is expressly named â€œthe doctor of the dead.â€ m. noirtier could not be
persuaded to quit his grandchild. at the end of a quarter of an hour m.
dâ€™avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate closed,

to them. but he stopped on the landing; he had not the courage
to again visit the death chamber. the two doctors, therefore, entered
the room alone. noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless, and silent
as the corpse. the district doctor approached with the indifference of a
man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead; he then lifted
the sheet which was placed over the face, and just unclosed the lips.

â€œalas,â€ said dâ€™avrigny, â€œshe is indeed dead, poor child!â€


â€œyes,â€ answered the doctor laconically, dropping the sheet he had
raised. noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old manâ€™s
eyes sparkled, and the

â€œi am going, sir; and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be
more fervent than mine.â€ dâ€™avrigny took the priestâ€™s hand, and without
meeting villefort, who was engaged in his study, they reached
valentineâ€™s room, which on the following night was to be occupied by the
undertakers. on entering the room, noirtierâ€™s eyes met those of the
abbÃ©, and no doubt he read some particular expression in them, for he
remained in the room. dâ€™avrigny recommended the attention of the priest
to the living as well as to the dead, and the abbÃ© promised to devote
his prayers to valentine and his attentions to noirtier. in order,
doubtless, that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred
mission, the priest rose as soon as dâ€™avrigny departed, and not only
bolted the door through which the doctor had just

the next morning dawned dull and cloudy. during the night the
undertakers had executed their melancholy office, and wrapped the corpse
in the winding-sheet, which, whatever may be said about the equality of
death, is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life. this
winding-sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric, which
the young girl had bought a fortnight before. during the evening two
men, engaged for the purpose, had carried noirtier from valentineâ€™s room
into his own, and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in
withdrawing him from his child. the abbÃ© busoni had watched till
daylight, and then left without calling anyone. dâ€™avrigny returned about
eight oâ€™clock in the morning; he met villefort on his way to noirtierâ€™s
room, and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept. they found
him in the large armchair, which served him for a bed, enjoying a calm,
nay, almost a smiling sleep. they both sto

â€œsee,â€ said dâ€™avrigny to villefort, â€œnature knows how to alleviate the
deepest sorrow. no one can say that m. noirtier did not love his child,
and yet he sleeps.â€

â€œyes, you are right,â€ replied villefort, surprised; â€œhe sleeps, indeed!
and this is the more strange, since the least contradiction keeps him
awake all night.â€

â€œgrief has stunned him,â€ replied dâ€™avrigny; and they both returned
thoughtfully to the procureurâ€™s study.

â€œsee, i have not slept,â€ said villefort, showing his undisturbed bed;
â€œgrief does not stun me. i have not been in bed for two nights; but then

money. â€œthatâ€™s what i mean,â€ said andrea, endeavoring to smile, quite
overcome by the strange tranquillity of bertuccio. â€œcan i be deceived?â€
 he murmured, as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they
call â€œthe salad basket.â€ â€œnever mind, we shall see! tomorrow, then!â€ he
added, turning towards bertuccio.

â€œtomorrow!â€ replied the steward.



chapter 108. the judge

we remember that the abbÃ© busoni remained alone with noirtier in the
chamber of death, and that the old man and the priest were the sole
guardians of the young girlâ€™s body. perhaps it was the christian
exhortations of the abbÃ©, perhaps his kind charity, perhaps his
persuasive words, which had restored the courage of noirtier, for ever
since he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded
to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive
affection for valentine. m. de villefort had not seen his father since

 the death. the whole establishment had been changed;
another valet was engaged for himself, a new servant for noirtier, two
women had entered madame de villefortâ€™s service,--in fact, everywhere,
to the concierge and coachmen, new faces were presented to the different
masters of the house, thus widening the division which had always
existed between the members of the same family.

the assizes, also, were about to begin, and villefort, shut up in his
room, exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case
against the murderer of caderousse. this affair, like all those in which

brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season. more than once
he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded gate
stood overlooking the deserted enclosure, always returning by the same
path, to begin his walk again, at the same pace and with the same
gesture, when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house, whence
he heard the noisy play of his son, who had returned from school to
spend the sunday and monday with his mother. while doing so, he observed
m. noirtier at one of the open windows, where the old man had been
placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded
some heat, and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of
the creeper which twined around the balcony.

the eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which villefort could
scarcely distinguish. his glance was so full of hate, of ferocity, and
savage impatience, that villefort turned out of the path he had been
pursuing, to see upon what person this dark loo

k was directed. then he
saw beneath a thick clump of linden-trees, which were nearly divested of
foliage, madame de villefort sitting with a book in her hand, the
perusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son, or to
throw back his elastic ball, which he obstinately threw from the
drawing-room into the garden. villefort became pale; he understood the
old manâ€™s meaning. noirtier continued to look at the same object, but
suddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband, and
villefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes,
which, while changing their direction and even their language, had lost
none of their menacing expression. madame de villefort, unconscious of
the passions that exhausted their fire over her head, at that moment
held her sonâ€™s ball, and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a
kiss. edward begged for a long

ficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain
it; however at length he decided, leaped out of the window into a
cluster of heliotropes and daisies, and ran to his mother, his forehead
streaming with perspiration. madame de villefort wiped his forehead,
pressed her lips upon it, and sent him back with the ball in one hand
and some bonbons in the other.

villefort, drawn by an irresistible attraction, like that of the bird to
the serpent, walked towards the house. as he approached it, noirtierâ€™s
gaze followed him, and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that
villefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart. in that earnest
look might be read a deep reproach, as well as a terrible menace. then
noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to remind his son of a
forgotten oath. â€œit is well, sir,â€ replied villefort from below,--â€œit is
well; have patience but one day longer; what i have said i will do.â€
 noirtier seemed to be calmed by these words, and turned his

crossed the sky, and seemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood
out in black relief on the horizon. in the clover-fields beyond the
chestnut-trees, a lark was mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her
clear morning song. the damps of the dew bathed the head of villefort,
and refreshed his memory. â€œtoday,â€ he said with an effort,--â€œtoday the
man who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt.â€
 involuntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of noirtierâ€™s room,
where he had seen him the preceding night. the curtain was drawn, and
yet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed
the closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the
opening he had beheld the menacing old man. â€œyes,â€ he murmured,--â€œyes,
be satisfied.â€

his head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his
study; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to
sleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold

enormously, to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in
that house. well, now listen.â€

â€œwe are listening.â€

â€œit appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle
containing some drug, which he every now and then uses against those who
have displeased him. first, m. and madame de saint-mÃ©ran incurred his
displeasure, so he poured out three drops of his elixir--three drops
were sufficient; then followed barrois, the old servant of m. noirtier,
who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch--he therefore received the
same quantity of the elixir; the same happened to valentine, of whom he
was jealous; he gave her the same dose as the others, and all was over
for her as well as the rest.â€

â€œwhy, what nonsense are you telling us?â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œyes, it is an extraordinary story,â€ said beauchamp; â€œis it not?â€

â€œit is absurd,â€ said debray.

the carriage stopped at the door of the house. villefort leaped out of
the carriage, and saw that his servants were surprised at his early
return; he could read no other expression on their features. neither of
them spoke to him; they merely stood aside to let him pass by, as usual,
nothing more. as he passed by m. noirtierâ€™s room, he perceived two
figures through the half-open door; but he experienced no curiosity to
know who was visiting his father: anxiety carried him on further.

â€œcome,â€ he said, as he ascended the stairs leading to his wifeâ€™s room,
â€œnothing is changed here.â€ he then closed the door of the landing. â€œno
one must disturb us,â€ he said; â€œi must speak freely to her, accuse
myself, and sayâ€--he approached the door, touched the crystal handle,
which yielded to his hand. â€œnot loc

his strength of mind, by despair, by the supreme agony which led the
titans to scale the heavens, and ajax to defy the gods. he now arose,
his head bowed beneath the weight of grief, and, shaking his damp,
dishevelled hair, he who had never felt compassion for anyone determined
to seek his father, that he might have someone to whom he could relate
his misfortunes,--some one by whose side he might weep.

he descended the little staircase with which we are acquainted, and
entered noirtierâ€™s room. the old man appeared to be listening
attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the
abbÃ© busoni, who looked cold and calm, as usual. villefort, perceiving
the abbÃ©, passed his hand across his brow.

he recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at
auteuil, and then the visit the abbÃ© had himself paid to his house on
the day of valentineâ€™s death. â€œyou here, sir!â€ he exclaimed; â€œdo you,
then, never appear but to act as an escort to dea

ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb. â€œprepare

â€œno,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œgod grant i may not have done too much
already.â€

taken away ali, and bertuccio remained with noirtier.

and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf, danglars, and villefort.

â€œand have you placed the letter before him, as i ordered you to do?â€

the slave respectfully signalized that he had. â€œand what did he say, or
rather do?â€ ali placed himself in the light, so that his master might
see him distinctly, and then imitating in his intelligent manner the
countenance of the old man, he closed his eyes, as noirtier was in the
custom of doing when saying â€œyes.â€

â€œgood; he accepts,â€ said monte cristo. â€œnow let us go.â€


these words had scarcely escaped him, when the carriage was on its way,
and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement.

â€œah, it is jacopo,â€ she said, â€œthe captain of the yacht;â€ and she
beckoned him towards them.

â€œdo you wish to speak to us?â€ asked morrel.

â€œi have a letter to give you from the count.â€

â€œfrom the count!â€ murmured the two young people.

â€œyes; read it.â€


morrel opened the letter, and read:

â€œmy dear maximilian,

â€œthere is a felucca for you at anchor. jacopo will carry you to leghorn,
where monsieur noirtier awaits his granddaughter, whom he wishes to
bless before you lead her to the altar. all that is in this grotto, my
friend, my house in the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es, and my chÃ¢teau at trÃ©port, are
the marriage gifts bestowed by edmond dantÃ¨s upon the son of his old
