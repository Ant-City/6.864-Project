hostess.  i only wanted to show that it isn't the least
what we expected.  why did we settle that their house would
be all gables and wiggles, and their garden all
gamboge-coloured paths?  i believe simply because we
associate them with expensive hotels--mrs. wilcox trailing
in beautiful dresses down long corridors, mr. wilcox
bullying porters, etc.  we females are that unjust.

i shall be back saturday; will let you know train
later.  they are as angry as i am that you did not come too;
really tibby is too tiresome, he starts a new mortal disease
every month.  how could he have got hay fever in london?
and even if he could, it seems hard that you should give up
a visit to hear a schoolboy sneeze.  tell him that charles
wilcox (the son who is here) has hay fever too, but he's
brave, and gets quite cross when we inquire after it.  men
like the wilcoxes would do tibby a power of good.  but you
won't agree, and i'd better change the subject.

original structure.  we wasted a whole day, and came across
the wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public
gardens.  they too, poor things, had been taken in--they
were actually stopping at speyer--and they rather liked
helen insisting that they must fly with us to heidelberg.
as a matter of fact, they did come on next day.  we all took
some drives together.  they knew us well enough to ask helen
to come and see them--at least, i was asked too, but tibby's
illness prevented me, so last monday she went alone.  that's
all.  you know as much as i do now.  it's a young man out
the unknown.  she was to have come back saturday, but put
off till monday, perhaps on account of--i don't know.

it was rather difficult.  something must be done about
helen.  she must be assured that it is not a criminal
offence to love at first sight.  a telegram to this effect
would be cold and cryptic, a personal visit seemed each
moment more impossible.  now the doctor arrived, and said
that tibby was quite bad.  might it really be best to accept
aunt juley's kind offer, and to send her down to howards end
with a note?

certainly margaret was impulsive.  she did swing rapidly
from one decision to another.  running downstairs into the
library, she cried--"yes, i have changed my mind; i do wish
that you would go."

there was a train from king's cross at eleven.  at
half-past ten tibby, with rare self-effacement, fell asleep,
and margaret was able to drive her aunt to the station.

but aunt juley was gone--gone irrevocably, and no power
on earth could stop her.


chapter 3

most complacently did mrs. munt rehearse her mission.  her
nieces were independent young women, and it was not often
that she was able to help them.  emily's daughters had never
been quite like other girls.  they had been left motherless
when tibby was born, when helen was five and margaret
herself but thirteen.  it was before the passing of the
deceased wife's sister bill, so mrs. munt could without
impropriety offer to go and keep house at wickham place.
but her brother-in-law, who was peculiar and a german, had
referred the question to margaret, who with the crudity of
youth had answered, "no, they could manage much better
alone." five years later mr. schlegel had died too, and mrs.
munt had repeated her offer.  margaret, crude no long

it was settling again, but not all into the road from which
he had taken it.  some of it had percolated through the open
windows, some had whitened the roses and gooseberries of the
wayside gardens, while a certain proportion had entered the
lungs of the villagers.  "i wonder when they'll learn wisdom
and tar the roads," was his comment.  then a man ran out of
the draper's with a roll of oilcloth, and off they went again.

"margaret could not come herself, on account of poor
tibby, so i am here to represent her and to have a good talk."

"i'm sorry to be so dense," said the young man, again
drawing up outside a shop.  "but i still haven't quite understood."

"helen, mr. wilcox--my niece and you."

he pushed up his goggles and gazed at her, absolutely
bewildered.  horror smote her to the heart, for even she
began to suspect that they were at cross-purposes, and that
she had commenced her mission by some hideous blunder.

"miss schlegel and myself." he asked, compressing h

but looks have their influence upon character.  the sisters
were alike as little girls, but at the time of the wilcox
episode their methods were beginning to diverge; the younger
was rather apt to entice people, and, in enticing them, to
be herself enticed; the elder went straight ahead, and
accepted an occasional failure as part of the game.

little need be premised about tibby.  he was now an
intelligent man of sixteen, but dyspeptic and difficile.


chapter 5

it will be generally admitted that beethoven's fifth
symphony is the most sublime noise that has ever penetrated
into the ear of man.  all sorts and conditions are satisfied
by it.  whether you are like mrs. munt, and tap
surreptitiously when the tunes come--of course, not so as to
disturb the others--; or like helen, who can see heroes and
shipwrecks in the music's flood; or like margaret, who can

in counterpoint, and holds the full score open on his knee;
or like their cousin, fraulein mosebach, who remembers all
the time that beethoven is "echt deutsch"; or like fraulein
mosebach's young man, who can remember nothing but fraulein
mosebach: in any case, the passion of your life becomes more
vivid, and you are bound to admit that such a noise is cheap
at two shillings.  it is cheap, even if you hear it in the

applause, and a round of "wunderschoning" and
"prachtvolleying" from the german contingent.  margaret
started talking to her new young man; helen said to her
aunt: "now comes the wonderful movement: first of all the
goblins, and then a trio of elephants dancing;" and tibby
implored the company generally to look out for the
transitional passage on the drum.

"on the what, dear?"

"on the drum, aunt juley."

"no; look out for the part where you think you have done
with the goblins and they come back," breathed helen, as the
music started with a goblin walking quietly over the
universe, from end to end.  others followed him.  they were
not aggressive creatures; it was that that made them so
terrible to helen.  they merely observed in passing that

had happened or could happen in her career.  she read it as
a tangible statement, which could never be superseded.  the
notes meant this and that to her, and they could have no
other meaning, and life could have no other meaning.  she
pushed right out of the building, and walked slowly down the
outside staircase, breathing the autumnal air, and then she
strolled home.

"margaret," called mrs. munt, "is helen all right?"

"oh yes."

"she is always going away in the middle of a programme,"
said tibby.

"the music has evidently moved her deeply," said
fraulein mosebach.

"excuse me," said margaret's young man, who had for some
time been preparing a sentence, "but that lady has, quite
inadvertently, taken my umbrella."

"oh, good gracious me! --i am so sorry.  tibby, run
after helen."

"i shall miss the four serious songs if i do."

"tibby love, you must go."

"it isn't of any consequence," said the young man, in
truth a little uneasy about his umbrella.

"but of course it is.  tibby!  tibby!

"

tibby rose to his feet, and wilfully caught his person
on the backs of the chairs.  by the time he had tipped up
the seat and had found his hat, and had deposited his full
score in safety, it was "too late" to go after helen.  the
four serious songs had begun, and one could not move during
their performance.

"my sister is so careless," whispered margaret.

"not at all," replied the young man; but his voice was
dead and cold.

"if you would give me your address--"

"oh, not at all, not at all;" and h

then the four serious songs rang shallow in margaret's
ears.  brahms, for all his grumbling and grizzling, had
never guessed what it felt like to be suspected of stealing
an umbrella.  for this fool of a young man thought that she
and helen and tibby had been playing the confidence trick on
him, and that if he gave his address they would break into
his rooms some midnight or other and steal his walkingstick
too.  most ladies would have laughed, but margaret really
minded, for it gave her a glimpse into squalor.  to trust
people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can indulge;
the poor cannot afford it.  as soon as brahms had grunted
himself out, she gave him her card and said, "that is where
we live; if you preferred, you could call for t

 the gallery at covent garden, but she
did not "attend" it, preferring the more expensive seats;
still less did she love it.  so she made no reply.

"this year i have been three times--to faust, tosca,
and--" was it "tannhouser" or "tannhoyser"?  better not risk
the word.

margaret disliked tosca and faust.  and so, for one
reason and another, they walked on in silence, chaperoned by
the voice of mrs. munt, who was getting into difficulties
with her nephew.

"i do in a way remember the passage, tibby, but when
every instrument is so beautiful, it is difficult to pick
out one thing rather than another.  i am sure that you and
helen take me to the very nicest concerts.  not a dull note
from beginning to end.  i only wish that our german friends
would have stayed till it finished."

"but surely you haven't forgotten the drum steadily
beating on the low c, aunt juley?" came tibby's voice.  "no
one could.  it's unmistakable."

"a specially loud part?" hazarded mrs. munt.  "of course

in for being musical," she added, the shot
failing.  "i only care for music--a very different thing.
but still i will say this for myself--i do know when i like
a thing and when i don't.  some people are the same about
pictures.  they can go into a picture gallery--miss conder
can--and say straight off what they feel, all round the
wall.  i never could do that.  but music is so different to
pictures, to my mind.  when it comes to music i am as safe
as houses, and i assure you, tibby, i am by no means pleased
by everything.  there was a thing--something about a faun in
french--which helen went into ecstasies over, but i thought
it most tinkling and superficial, and said so, and i held to
my opinion too."

"do you agree?" asked margaret.  "do you think music is
so different to pictures?"

"i--i should have thought so, kind of," he said.

"so should i. now, my sister declares they're just the
same.  we have great arguments over it.  she says i'm dense;
i say she's sloppy." ge

the light was turned on, and they began to search the
hall, helen, who had abruptly parted with the fifth
symphony, commenting with shrill little cries.

"don't you talk, meg!  you stole an old gentleman's silk
top-hat.  yes, she did, aunt juley.  it is a positive fact.
she thought it was a muff.  oh, heavens!  i've knocked the
in and out card down.  where's frieda?  tibby, why don't you
ever--no, i can't remember what i was going to say.  that
wasn't it, but do tell the maids to hurry tea up.  what
about this umbrella?"  she opened it.  "no, it's all gone
along the seams.  it's an appalling umbrella.  it must be mine."

but it was not.

he took it from her, murmured a few words of thanks, and
then fled, with the lilting step of the clerk.

"but if you will stop--" cried margaret.  "now, helen,
how stupid you've been!"

"whatever have i done?"

"don't you see tha

their brother, finding the incident commonplace, had
stolen upstairs to see whether there were scones for tea.
he warmed the teapot--almost too deftly--rejected the orange
pekoe that the parlour-maid had provided, poured in five
spoonfuls of a superior blend, filled up with really boiling
water, and now called to the ladies to be quick or they
would lose the aroma.

"all right, auntie tibby," called helen, while margaret,
thoughtful again, said: "in a way, i wish we had a real boy
in the house--the kind of boy who cares for men.  it would
make entertaining so much easier."

"so do i," said her sister.  "tibby only cares for
cultured females singing brahms." and when they joined him
she said rather sharply: "why didn't you make that young man
welcome, tibby?  you must do the host a little, you know.
you ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into
stopping, instead of letting hi

tibby sighed, and drew a long strand of hair over his forehead.

"oh, it's no good looking superior.  i mean what i say."

"leave tibby alone!" said margaret, who could not bear
her brother to be scolded.

"here's the house a regular hen-coop!" grumbled helen.

"oh, my dear!" protested mrs. munt.  "how can you say
such dreadful things!  the number of men you get here has
always astonished me. if there is any danger it's the other
way round."

"yes, but it's the wrong sort of men, helen means."

"no, i don't," corrected helen.  "we get the right sort
of man, but the wrong side of him, and i say that's tibby's
fault.  there ought

 to be a something about the house--an--i
don't know what."

"a touch of the w.'s, perhaps?"

helen put out her tongue.

"who are the w.'s?" asked tibby.

"the w.'s are things i and meg and aunt juley know about
and you don't, so there!"

"i suppose that ours is a female house," said margaret,
"and one must just accept it.  no, aunt juley, i don't mean
that this house is full of women.  i am trying to say
something much more clever.  i mean that it was irrevocably
feminine, even in father's time.  now i'm sure you
understand!  well, i'll give you another example.  it'll
shock you, but i don't care.  suppose queen victoria gave a
dinner-party, a

you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have

sat would have seen to that.  so with our house--it must be
feminine, and all we can do is to see that it isn't
effeminate.  just as another house that i can mention, but i
won't, sounded irrevocably masculine, and all its inmates
can do is to see that it isn't brutal."

"that house being the w.'s house, i presume," said tibby.

"you're not going to be told about the w.'s, my child,"
helen cried, "so don't you think it.  and on the other hand,
i don't the least mind if you find out, so don't you think
you've done anything clever, in either case.  give me a cigarette."

"you do what you can for the house," said margaret.
"the drawing-room reeks of smoke."

"if you smoked too, the house might suddenly turn
masculine.  atmosphere is probably a question of touch and
go.  even at queen victoria's dinner-party--if somethin

ast june, if helen and paul wilcox had been poor
people, and couldn't invoke railways and motor-cars to part them."

"that's more like socialism," said mrs. munt suspiciously.

"call it what you like.  i call it going through life
with one's hand spread open on the table.  i'm tired of
these rich people who pretend to be poor, and think it shows
a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their
feet above the waves.  i stand each year upon six hundred
pounds, and helen upon the same, and tibby will stand upon
eight, and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea
they are renewed--from the sea, yes, from the sea.  and all
our thoughts are the thoughts of six-hundred-pounders, and
all our speeches; and because we don't want to steal
umbrellas ourselves, we forget that below the sea people do
want to steal them, and do steal them sometimes, and that
what's a joke up here is down there reality--"

"there they go--there goes fraulein mosebach.  really,

hen helen simulated tears, and fraulein mosebach, who
thought her extremely amusing, did the same.  "oh, boo hoo!
boo hoo hoo!  meg's going to return the call, and i can't.
'cos why?  'cos i'm going to german-eye."

"if you are going to germany, go and pack; if you
aren't, go and call on the wilcoxes instead of me."

"but, meg, meg, i don't love the young gentleman; i
don't love the young--0 lud, who's that coming down the
stairs?  i vow 'tis my brother. 0 crimini!"

a male--even such a male as tibby--was enough to stop
the foolery.  the barrier of sex, though decreasing among
the civilized, is still high, and higher on the side of
women.  helen could tell her sister all, and her cousin much
about paul; she told her brother nothing.  it was not
prudishness, for she now spoke of "the wilcox ideal" with
laughter, and even with a growing brutality.  nor was it
precaution, for tibby seldom repeated any news that did not
concern himself.  it was rather the feeling that she
betrayed a secret into

at, however
trivial it was on this side of the barrier, it would become
important on that.  so she stopped, or rather began to fool
on other subjects, until her long-suffering relatives drove
her upstairs.  fraulein mosebach followed her, but lingered
to say heavily over the banisters to margaret, "it is all
right--she does not love the young man--he has not been
worthy of her."

"yes, i know; thanks very much."

"i thought i did right to tell you."

"ever so many thanks."

"what's that?" asked tibby.  no one told him, and he
proceeded into the dining-room, to eat elvas plums.

that evening margaret took decisive action.  the house
was very quiet, and the fog--we are in november now--pressed
against the windows like an excluded ghost.  frieda and
helen and all their luggage had gone.  tibby, who was not
feeling well, lay stretched on a sofa by the fire.  margaret
sat by him, thinking.  her mind darted from impulse to
impulse, and finally marshalled them all in review.  the

property.  she was bored when too minute an account was
given of the fussell family, of the anxieties of charles
concerning naples, of the movements of mr. wilcox and evie,
who were motoring in yorkshire.  margaret could not bear
being bored.  she grew inattentive, played with the
photograph frame, dropped it, smashed dolly's glass,
apologized, was pardoned, cut her finger thereon, was
pitied, and finally said she must be going--there was all
the housekeeping to do, and she had to interview tibby's
riding-master.

then the curious note was struck again.

"good-bye, miss schlegel, good-bye.  thank you for
coming.  you have cheered me up."

"i'm so glad!"

"i--i wonder whether you ever think about yourself.?"

"i think of nothing else," said margaret, blushing, but
letting her hand remain in that of the invalid.

"i wonder.  i wondered at heidelberg."

"i'm sure!"

"i almost think--"

"yes?" asked margaret, for there was a long pause--a
pause that was somehow akin to the flicker of the fi

es, and margaret watched the tall, lonely figure
sweep up the hall to the lift.  as the glass doors closed on
it she had the sense of an imprisonment.  the beautiful head
disappeared first, still buried in the muff, the long
trailing skirt followed.  a woman of undefinable rarity was
going up heaven-ward, like a specimen in a bottle.  and into
what a heaven--a vault as of hell, sooty black, from which
soots descended!

at lunch her brother, seeing her inclined for silence,
insisted on talking.  tibby was not ill-natured, but from
babyhood something drove him to do the unwelcome and the
unexpected.  now he gave her a long account of the
day-school that he sometimes patronized.  the account was
interesting, and she had often pressed him for it before,
but she could not attend now, for her mind was focussed on
the invisible.  she discerned that mrs. wilcox, though a
loving wife and mother, had only one passion in life--her
house--and that the moment was solemn when she invited a
friend to shar

she was deficient.  once past the rocks of emotion, they
knew so well what to do, whom to send for; their hands were
on all the ropes, they had grit as well as grittiness, and
she valued grit enormously.  they led a life that she could
not attain to--the outer life of "telegrams and anger,"
which had detonated when helen and paul had touched in june,
and had detonated again the other week.  to margaret this
life was to remain a real force.  she could not despise it,
as helen and tibby affected to do.  it fostered such virtues
as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second
rank, no doubt, but they have formed our civilization.  they
form character, too; margaret could not doubt it: they keep
the soul from becoming sloppy.  how dare schlegels despise
wilcoxes, when it takes all sorts to make a world?

"don't brood too much," she wrote to helen, "on the
superiority of the unseen to the seen.  it's true, but to
brood on it is mediaeval.  our business is not to contr

which it lay.  she had exclaimed, "oh, how lovely!  that's
the place for me!" and in the evening frieda appeared in her
bedroom.  "i have a message, dear helen," etc., and so she
had, but had been very nice when helen laughed; quite
understood--a forest too solitary and damp--quite agreed,
but herr forstmeister believed he had assurance to the
contrary.  germany had lost, but with good-humour; holding
the manhood of the world, she felt bound to win.  "and there
will even be someone for tibby," concluded helen.  "there
now, tibby, think of that; frieda is saving up a little girl
for you, in pig-tails and white worsted stockings, but the
feet of the stockings are pink, as if the little girl had
trodden in strawberries.  i've talked too much.  my head
aches.  now you talk."

tibby consented to talk.  he too was full of his own
affairs, for he had just been up to try for a scholarship at
oxford.  the men were down, and the candidates had been
housed in various colleges, and had dined i

was sensitive to beauty, the experience was new, and he gave
a description of his visit that was almost glowing.  the
august and mellow university, soaked with the richness of
the western counties that it has served for a thousand
years, appealed at once to the boy's taste: it was the kind
of thing he could understand, and he understood it all the
better because it was empty.  oxford is--oxford: not a mere
receptacle for youth, like cambridge.  perhaps it wants its
inmates to love it rather tha

n to love one another: such at
all events was to be its effect on tibby.  his sisters sent
him there that he might make friends, for they knew that his
education had been cranky, and had severed him from other
boys and men.  he made no friends.  his oxford remained
oxford empty, and he took into life with him, not the memory
of a radiance, but the memory of a colour scheme.

it pleased margaret to hear her brother and sister
talking.  they did not get on overwell as a rule.  for a few
moments she listened to them, feeling elderly and benign.
then something occurred

illionaire who owned the freehold of wickham
place, and desired to erect babylonian flats upon it--what
right had he to stir so large a portion of the quivering
jelly?  he was not a fool--she had heard him expose
socialism--but true insight began just where his
intelligence ended, and one gathered that this was the case
with most millionaires.  what right had such men--but
margaret checked herself.  that way lies madness.  thank
goodness she, too, had some money, and could purchase a new home.

tibby, now in his second year at oxford, was down for
the easter vacation, and margaret took the opportunity of
having a serious talk with him.  did he at all know where he
wanted to live?  tibby didn't know that he did know.  did he
at all know what he wanted to do?  he was equally uncertain,
but when pressed remarked that he should prefer to be quite
free of any profession.  margaret was not shocked, but went
on sewing for a few minutes before she replied:

"i was thinking of mr. vyse.  he never st

particularly happy."

"ye-es," said tibby, and then held his mouth open in a
curious quiver, as if he, too, had thoughts of mr. vyse, had
seen round, through, over, and beyond mr. vyse, had weighed
mr. vyse, grouped him, and finally dismissed him as having
no possible bearing on the subject under discussion.  that
bleat of tibby's infuriated helen.  but helen was now down
in the dining-room preparing a speech about political
economy.  at times her voice could be heard declaiming
through the floor.

"but mr. vyse is rather a wretched, weedy man, don't you
think?  then there's guy.  that was a pitiful business.

eve that in the last century men have developed the
desire for work, and they must not starve it.  it's a new
desire.  it goes with a great deal that's bad, but in itself
it's good, and i hope that for women, too, 'not to work'
will soon become as shocking as 'not to be married' was a
hundred years ago."

"i have no experience of this profound desire to which
you allude," enunciated tibby.

"then we'll leave the subject till you do.  i'm not
going to rattle you round.  take your time.  only do think
over the lives of the men you like most, and see how they've
arranged them."

"i like guy and mr. vyse most," said tibby faintly, and
leant so far back in his chair that he extended in a
horizontal line from knees to throat.

"and don't think i'm not serious because i don't use the
traditional arguments--making money, a sphere awaiting you,

boy.  look at the wilcoxes, look at mr. pembroke.  with all
their defects of temper and understanding, such men give me
more pleasure than many who are better equipped and i think
it is because they have worked regularly and honestly.

"spare me the wilcoxes," he moaned.

"i shall not.  they are the right sort."

"oh, goodness me, meg!" he protested, suddenly sitting
up, alert and angry.  tibby, for all his defects, had a
genuine personality.

"well, they're as near the right sort as you can imagine."

"no, no--oh, no!"

"i was thinking of the younger son, whom i once classed
as a ninny, but who came back so ill from nigeria.  he's
gone out there again, evie wilcox tells me--out to his duty."

"duty" always elicited a groan.

it is beastly work--dull country, dishonest natives, an

"i can't bother over results," said margaret, a little
sadly.  "they are too difficult for me.  i can only look at
the men.  an empire bores me, so far, but i can appreciate
the heroism that builds it up.  london bores me, but what
thousands of splendid people are labouring to make london--"

"what it is," he sneered.

"what it is, worse luck.  i want activity without
civilization.  how paradoxical!  yet i expect that is what
we shall find in heaven."

"and i," said tibby, "want civilization without
activity, which, i expect, is what we shall find in the
other place."

"you needn't go as far as the other place, tibbi-kins,
if you want that.  you can find it at oxford."

"stupid--"

"if i'm stupid, get me back to the house-hunting.  i'll
even live in oxford if you like--north oxford.  i'll live

in in a state of extreme excitement.

"oh, my dears, what do you think?  you'll never guess.
a woman's been here asking me for her husband.  her what?"
(helen was fond of supplying her own surprise.)  "yes, for
her husband, and it really is so."

"not anything to do with bracknell?" cried margaret, who
had lately taken on an unemployed of that name to clean the
knives and boots.

"i offered bracknell, and he was rejected.  so was
tibby. (cheer up, tibby!) it's no one we know.  i said,

"now, helen, what did happen really?"

"what i say.  i was, as it were, orating my speech.

"lan or len.  we were not nice about our vowels.  lanoline."

"but what an extraordinary--"

"i said, 'my good mrs. lanoline, we have some grave
misunderstanding here.  beautiful as i am, my modesty is
even more remarkable than my beauty, and never, never has
mr. lanoline rested his eyes on mine.'"

"i hope you were pleased," said tibby.

"of course," helen squeaked.  "a perfectly delightful
experience.  oh, mrs. lanoline's a dear--she asked for a
husband as if he was an umbrella.  she mislaid him saturday
afternoon--and for a long time suffered no inconvenience.
but all night, and all this morning her apprehensions grew.

"her figure may have been good once."

the flats, their only outlook, hung like an ornate
curtain between margaret and the welter of london.  her
thoughts turned sadly to house-hunting.  wickham place had
been so safe.  she feared, fantastically, that her own
little flock might be moving into turmoil and squalor, into
nearer contact with such episodes as these.

"tibby and i have again been wondering where we'll live
next september," she said at last.

"tibby had better first wonder what he'll do," retorted
helen; and that topic was resumed, but with acrimony.  then
tea came, and after tea helen went on preparing her speech,
and margaret prepared one, too, for they were going out to a
discussion society on the morrow.  but her thoughts were
poisoned.  mrs. lanoline had risen out of the abyss, like a
faint smell, a goblin football, telling of a life where love

the mystery, like so many mysteries, was explained.  next
day, just as they were dressed to go out to dinner, a mr.
bast called.  he was a clerk in the employment of the
porphyrion fire insurance company.  thus much from his
card.  he had come "about the lady yesterday." thus much
from annie, who had shown him into the dining-room.

"cheers, children!" cried helen.  "it's mrs. lanoline."

tibby was interested.  the three hurried downstairs, to
find, not the gay dog they expected, but a young man,
colourless, toneless, who had already the mournful eyes
above a drooping moustache that are so common in london, and
that haunt some streets of the city like accusing
presences.  one guessed him as the third generation,
grandson to the shepherd or ploughboy whom civilization had
sucked into the town; as one of the thousands who have lost
the life of the body and failed to reach the life of th

 don't understand."

an air of evasion characterized mr. bast.  he explained
again, but was obviously lying, and helen didn't see why he
should get off.  she had the cruelty of youth.  neglecting
her sister's pressure, she said, "i still don't understand.
when did you say you paid this call?"

"call?  what call?" said he, staring as if her question
had been a foolish one, a favourite device of those in mid-stream.

"this afternoon call."

"in the afternoon, of course!" he replied, and looked at
tibby to see how the repartee went.  but tibby, himself a
repartee, was unsympathetic, and said, "saturday afternoon
or sunday afternoon?"

"s-saturday."

"really!" said helen; "and you were still calling on
sunday, when your wife came here.  a long visit."

"i don't call that fair," said mr. bast, going scarlet
and handsome.  there was fight in his eyes."  i know what
you mean, and it isn't so."

"oh, don't let us mind," said margaret, distressed again
by odours from the abyss.

"it was something el

manner breaking down.  "i was somewhere else to what you
think, so there!"

"it was good of you to come and explain," she said.
"the rest is naturally no concern of ours."

"yes, but i want--i wanted--have you ever read the
ordeal of richard feverel?"

margaret nodded.

"it's a beautiful book.  i wanted to get back to the
earth, don't you see, like richard does in the end.  or have
you ever read stevenson's prince otto?"

helen and tibby groaned gently.

"that's another beautiful book.  you get back to the
earth in that.  i wanted--" he mouthed affectedly.  then
through the mists of his culture came a hard fact, hard as a
pebble.  "i walked all the saturday night," said leonard.
"i walked." a thrill of approval ran through the sisters.
but culture closed in again.  he asked whether they had ever
read e. v. lucas's open road.

said helen, "no doubt it's another beautiful book, but
i'd rather hear about your road."

"oh, i walked

at the office lately about these things.  the fellows there
said one steers by the pole star, and i looked it up in the
celestial atlas, but once out of doors everything gets so mixed--"

"don't talk to me about the pole star," interrupted
helen, who was becoming interested.  "i know its little
ways.  it goes round and round, and you go round after it."

"well, i lost it entirely.  first of all the street
lamps, then the trees, and towards morning it got cloudy."

tibby, who preferred his comedy undiluted, slipped from
the room.  he knew that this fellow would never attain to
poetry, and did not want to hear him trying.  margaret and
helen remained.  their brother influenced them more than
they knew: in his absence they were stirred to enthusiasm
more easily.

"where did you start from?" cried margaret.  "do tell us
more."

"i took the underground to wimbledon.  as i came out of
the office i said to myself, 'i must have a walk once in a

"i should like to know how he got hold of your card."

"but he said--something about a concert and an umbrella--"

"then did the card see the wife--"

"helen, come to bed."

"no, just a little longer, it is so beautiful.  tell me;
oh yes; did you say money is the warp of the world?"

"yes."

"then what's the woof?"

"very much what one chooses," said margaret.  "it's
something that isn't money--one can't say more."

"walking at night?"

"probably."

"for tibby, oxford?"

"it seems so."

"for you?"

"now that we have to leave wickham place, i begin to
think it's that.  for mrs. wilcox it was certainly howards end."

one's own name will carry immense distances.  mr.
wilcox, who was sitting with friends many seats away, heard
his, rose to his feet, and strolled along towards the speakers.

"it is sad to suppose that places may ever be more
important than people," continued margaret.

"why, meg?  they're so much nicer generally.  i'd rather

margaret crushed complacency down because she was
civilized.  mr. wilcox, uncivilized, continued to feel anger
long after he had rebuilt his defences, and was again
presenting a bastion to the world.

"miss schlegel, you're a pair of dear creatures, but you
really must be careful in this uncharitable world.  what
does your brother say?"

"i forget."

"surely he has some opinion?"

"he laughs, if i remember correctly."

"he's very clever, isn't he?" said evie, who had met and
detested tibby at oxford.

"yes, pretty well--but i wonder what helen's doing."

"she is very young to undertake this sort of thing,"
said mr. wilcox.

margaret went out into the landing.  she heard no sound,
and mr. bast's topper was missing from the hall.

"helen!" she called.

"yes!" replied a voice from the library.

"you in there?"

"yes--he's gone some time."

margaret went to her.  "why, you're all alone," she said.

"yes--it's all right, meg--poor, poor creature--"

toppling into the sea.  but there were all their father's
books--they never read them, but they were their father's,
and must be kept.  there was the marble-topped
chiffonier--their mother had set store by it, they could not
remember why.  round every knob and cushion in the house
sentiment gathered, a sentiment that was at times personal,
but more often a faint piety to the dead, a prolongation of
rites that might have ended at the grave.

it was absurd, if you came to think of it; helen and
tibby came to think of it: margaret was too busy with the
house-agents.  the feudal ownership of land did bring
dignity, whereas the modern ownership of movables is
reducing us again to a nomadic horde.  we are reverting to
the civilization of luggage, and historians of the future
will note how the middle classes accreted possessions
without taking root in the earth, and may find in this the
secret of their imaginative poverty.  the schlegels were
certainly the poorer for the loss of wickham place.

timate acquaintance.  it had begun long ago.  she had
been his wife's friend, and, as such, he had given her that
silver vinaigrette as a memento.  it was pretty of him to
have given that vinaigrette, and he had always preferred her
to helen--unlike most men.  but the advance had been
astonishing lately.  they had done more in a week than in
two years, and were really beginning to know each other.

she did not forget his promise to sample eustace miles,
and asked him as soon as she could secure tibby as his
chaperon.  he came, and partook of body-building dishes with
humility.

next morning the schlegels left for swanage.  they had
not succeeded in finding a new home.


chapter 18

as they were seated at aunt juley's breakfast-table at the
bays, parrying her excessive hospitality and enjoying the
view of the bay, a letter came for margaret and threw her
into perturbation.  it was from mr. wilcox.  it announced an
"important change" in his plans.  owing to evie's marriage,
he had decided to

the street.  we don't know what we want, that's the mischief
with us--"

"no, we have no real ties," said helen, helping herself
to toast.

"shan't i go up to town today, take the house if it's
the least possible, and then come down by the afternoon
train tomorrow, and start enjoying myself.  i shall be no
fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind."

"but you won't do anything rash, margaret?"

"there's nothing rash to do."

"who are the wilcoxes?" said tibby, a question that
sounds silly, but was really extremely subtle, as his aunt
found to her cost when she tried to answer it.  "i don't
manage the wilcoxes; i don't see where they come in."

"no more do i," agreed helen.  "it's funny that we just
don't lose sight of them.  out of all our hotel
acquaintances, mr. wilcox is the only one who has stuck.  it
is now over three years, and we have drifted away from far
more interesting people in that time.

"interesting people don't get one houses."

"meg

, if you start in your honest-english vein, i shall
throw the treacle at you."

"it's a better vein than the cosmopolitan," said
margaret, getting up. "now, children, which is it to be?
you know the ducie street house.  shall i say yes or shall i
say no?  tibby love--which?  i'm specially anxious to pin
you both."

"it all depends what meaning you attach to the word 'possi--'"

"it depends on nothing of the sort.  say 'yes.'"

"say 'no.'"

then margaret spoke rather seriously.  "i think," she
said, "that our race is degenerating.  we cannot settle even
this little thing; what will it be like when we have to
settle a big one?"

"it will be as easy as eating," returned helen.

"i was thinking of father.  how could he settle to leave

was signed, and emily took train with baby--who was margaret
then--and the smaller luggage for london, without so much as
knowing where her new home would be.  getting away from that
house may be hard, but it is nothing to the misery that we
all went through getting you into it."

helen, with her mouth full, cried: "and that's the man
who beat the austrians, and the danes, and the french, and
who beat the germans that were inside himself.  and we're
like him."

"speak for yourself," said tibby.  "remember that i am
cosmopolitan, please."

"helen may be right."

"of course she's right," said helen.

helen might be right, but she did not go up to london.
margaret did that.  an interrupted holiday is the worst of
the minor worries, and one may be pardoned for feeling
morbid when a business letter snatches one away from the sea
and friends.  she could not believe that her father had ever
felt the same.  her eyes had been troubling her lately, so
that she could not read in the train, and

"evie!" he echoed in injured tones.  "you won't see
her.  she's gone out with cahill.  it's no fun, i can tell
you, being left so much alone.  i've got my work all
day--indeed, a great deal too much of it--but when i come
home in the evening, i tell you, i can't stand the house."

"in my absurd way, i'm lonely too," margaret replied.
"it's heart-breaking to leave one's old home.  i scarcely
remember anything before wickham place, and helen and tibby
were born there.  helen says--"

"you, too, feel lonely?"

"horribly.  hullo, parliament's back!"

mr. wilcox glanced at parliament contemptuously.  the
more important ropes of life lay elsewhere.  "yes, they are
talking again." said he. "but you were going to say--"

"only some rubbish about furniture.  helen says it alone
endures while men and houses perish, and that in the end the
world will be a desert of chairs and sofas--just imagine
it! --rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon

idiot though she might be, surely mr. wilcox was more--how
should one put it? --more psychological than usual.  always
a good judge of character for business purposes, he seemed
this afternoon to enlarge his field, and to note qualities
outside neatness, obedience, and decision.

"i want to go over the whole house," she announced when
they arrived.  "as soon as i get back to swanage, which will
be tomorrow afternoon, i'll talk it over once more with
helen and tibby, and wire you 'yes' or 'no.'"

"right.  the dining-room." and they began their survey.

the dining-room was big, but over-furnished.  chelsea
would have moaned aloud.  mr. wilcox had eschewed those
decorative schemes that wince, and relent, and refrain, and
achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and pluck.  after so
much self-colour and self-denial, margaret viewed with
relief the sumptuous dado, the frieze, the gilded
wall-paper, amid whose foliage parrots sang.  it would never

frieda assented, and in a few minutes they had crossed
the ridge and exchanged the greater view for the lesser.
rather a dull valley lay below, backed by the slope of the
coastward downs.  they were looking across the isle of
purbeck and on to swanage, soon to be the most important
town of all, and ugliest of the three.  margaret's train
reappeared as promised, and was greeted with approval by her
aunt.  it came to a standstill in the middle distance, and
there it had been planned that tibby should meet her, and
drive her, and a tea-basket, up to join them.

"you see," continued helen to her cousin, "the wilcoxes
collect houses as your victor collects tadpoles.  they have,
one, ducie street; two, howards end, where my great rumpus
was; three, a country seat in shropshire; four, charles has
a house in hilton; and five, another near epsom; and six,
evie will have a house when she marries, and probably a
pied-a-terre in the country--which makes seven.  oh yes, and

was a landscape of bocklin's beside a landscape of leader's,
strident and ill-considered, but quivering into supernatural
life.  it sharpened idealism, stirred the soul.  it may have
been a bad preparation for what followed.

"look!" cried aunt juley, hurrying away from
generalities over the narrow summit of the down.  "stand
where i stand, and you will see the pony-cart coming.  i see
the pony-cart coming."

they stood and saw the pony-cart coming.  margaret and
tibby were presently seen coming in it.  leaving the
outskirts of swanage, it drove for a little through the
budding lanes, and then began the ascent.

"have you got the house?" they shouted, long before she
could possibly hear.

helen ran down to meet her.  the highroad passed over a
saddle, and a track went thence at right angles along the
ridge of the down.

"have you got the house?"

margaret shook her head.

"oh, what a nuisance!  so we're as we were?"

"not exactly."

she got out, looking tired

"some mystery," said tibby.  "we are to be enlightened presently."

margaret came close up to her and whispered that she had
had a proposal of marriage from mr. wilcox.

helen was amused.  she opened the gate on to the downs
so that her brother might lead the pony through.  "it's just
like a widower," she remarked.  "they've cheek enough for
anything, and invariably select one of their first wife's friends."

margaret's face flashed despair.

"that type--" she broke off with a cry.  "meg, not

"but you've never conceivably--you've never--" she
pulled herself together.  "tibby, hurry up through; i can't

juley, make the tea, will you, and frieda; we've got to talk
houses, and i'll come on afterwards." and then, turning her
face to her sister's, she burst into tears.

margaret was stupefied.  she heard herself saying, "oh,
really--"  she felt herself touched with a hand that trembled.

"don't," sobbed helen, "don't, don't, meg, don't!"  she
seemed incapable of saying any other word.  margaret,

"by the way--"

"--a suggestion, a seed," she concluded; and the thought
flew away into darkness.

"i was thinking, if you didn't mind, that we ought to
spend this evening in a business talk; there will be so much
to settle."

"i think so too.  tell me, in the first place, how did
you get on with tibby?"

"with your brother?"

"yes, during cigarettes."

"oh, very well."

"i am so glad," she answered, a little surprised.  "what

lowering his voice and infusing a hint of reproof into
it, he said: "evie will probably be married in september.
we could scarcely think of anything before then."

"the earlier the nicer, henry.  females are not supposed
to say such things, but the earlier the nicer."

"how about september for us too?" he asked, rather dryly.

"right.  shall we go into ducie street ourselves in
september?  or shall we try to bounce helen and tibby into
it?  that's rather an idea.  they are so unbusinesslike, we
could make them do anything by judicious management.  look
here--yes.  we'll do that.  and we ourselves could live at
howards end or shropshire."

bridge would be built and span their lives with beauty.

but she failed.  for there was one quality in henry for
which she was never prepared, however much she reminded
herself of it: his obtuseness.  he simply did not notice
things, and there was no more to be said.  he never noticed
that helen and frieda were hostile, or that tibby was not
interested in currant plantations; he never noticed the
lights and shades that exist in the grayest conversation,
the finger-posts, the milestones, the collisions, the
illimitable views.  once--on another occasion--she scolded
him about it.  he was puzzled, but replied with a laugh: "my
motto is concentrate.  i've no intention of frittering away
my strength on that sort of thing." "it isn't frittering
away the strength," she protested.  "it's enlarging the

go on and fight with him and help him.  don't ask me for
help, or even for sympathy.  henceforward i'm going my own
way.  i mean to be thorough, because thoroughness is easy.
i mean to dislike your husband, and to tell him so.  i mean
to make no concessions to tibby.  if tibby wants to live
with me, he must lump me.  i mean to love you more than
ever.  yes, i do.  you and i have built up something real,
because it is purely spiritual.  there's no veil of mystery
over us.  unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches
the body.  the popular view is, as usual, exactly the wrong
one.  our bothers are over tangible things--money, husbands,
house-hunting.  but heaven will work of itself."

margaret was grateful for this expression of affection,

talked till midnight, but margaret, with her packing to do,
focussed the conversation on henry.  she might abuse henry
behind his back, but please would she always, be civil to
him in company?  "i definitely dislike him, but i'll do what
i can," promised helen.  "do what you can with my friends in
return."

this conversation made margaret easier.  their inner
life was so safe that they could bargain over externals in a
way that would have been incredible to aunt juley, and
impossible for tibby or charles.  there are moments when the
inner life actually "pays," when years of self-scrutiny,
conducted for no ulterior motive, are suddenly of practical
use.  such moments are still rare in the west; that they
come at all promises a fairer future.  margaret, though
unable to understand her sister, was assured against
estrangement, and returned to london with a more peaceful mind.

the following morning, at eleven o'clock, she presented
herself at the offices of the imperial and west african

plynlimmon and lady edser, mrs. warrington wilcox and her
daughter, and lastly, the little girl, very smart and quiet,
who figures at so many weddings, and who kept a watchful eye
on margaret, the bride-elect, dolly was absent--a domestic
event detained her at hilton; paul had cabled a humorous
message; charles was to meet them with a trio of motors at
shrewsbury.  helen had refused her invitation; tibby had
never answered his.  the management was excellent, as was to
be expected with anything that henry undertook; one was
conscious of his sensible and generous brain in the
background.  they were his guests as soon as they reached
the train; a special label for their luggage; a courier; a
special lunch; they had only to look pleasant and, where
possible, pretty.  margaret thought with dismay of her own
nuptials--presumably under the management of tibby.  "mr.

folded hands, tragical, while the servant shouted, and was
misunderstood by another servant in the garden.  then came a
difficulty about a spring-board, and soon three people were
running backwards and forwards over the meadow, with orders
and counter orders and recriminations and apologies.  if
margaret wanted to jump from a motor-car, she jumped; if
tibby thought paddling would benefit his ankles, he paddled;

margaret went forward, smiling socially.  she supposed
that these were unpunctual guests, who would have to be
content with vicarious civility, since evie and charles were
gone, henry tired, and the others in their rooms.  she
assumed the airs of a hostess; not for long.  for one of the
group was helen--helen in her oldest clothes, and dominated
by that tense, wounding excitement that had made her a
terror in their nursery days.

"what is it?" she called.  "oh, what's wrong?  is tibby ill?"

helen spoke to her two companions, who fell back.  then
she bore forward furiously.

"they're starving!" she shouted.  "i found them starving!"

"who?  why have you come?"

"the basts."

"oh, helen!" moaned margaret.  "whatever have you done now?"

"he has lost his place.  he has been turned out of his
bank.  yes, he's done for.  we upper classes have ruined
him, and i suppose you'll tell me it's the battle of life.

she never saw it again.  day and night the river flows
down into england, day after day the sun retreats into the
welsh mountains, and the tower chimes, "see the conquering
hero." but the wilcoxes have no part in the place, nor in
any place.  it is not their names that recur in the parish
register.  it is not their ghosts that sigh among the alders
at evening.  they have swept into the valley and swept out
of it, leaving a little dust and a little money behind.


chapter 30

tibby was now approaching his last year at oxford.  he had
moved out of college, and was contemplating the universe, or
such portions of it as concerned him, from his comfortable
lodgings in long wall.  he was not concerned with much.
when a young man is untroubled by passions and sincerely
indifferent to public opinion, his outlook is necessarily
limited.  tibby neither wished to strengthen the position of
the rich nor to improve that of the poor, and so was well
content to watch the elms nodding be

consent to qualify as a student interpreter.  to him thus
employed helen entered.  a telegram had preceded her.

he noticed, in a distant way, that his sister had
altered.  as a rule he found her too pronounced, and had
never come across this look of appeal, pathetic yet
dignified--the look of a sailor who has lost everything at sea.

"i have come from oniton," she began.  "there has been a
great deal of trouble there."

"who's for lunch?" said tibby, picking up the claret,
which was warming in the hearth.  helen sat down
submissively at the table.  "why such an early start?" he asked.

"sunrise or something--when i could get away."

"so i surmise.  why?"

"i don't know what's to be done, tibby.  i am very much
upset at a piece of news that concerns meg, and do not want
to face her, and i am not going back to wickham place.  i
stopped here to tell you this."

the landlady came in with the cutlets.  tibby put a

is that everything may just as well be sold.  what does one
want with dusty economic, books, which have made the world
no better, or with mother's hideous chiffoniers?  i have
also another commission for you.  i want you to deliver a
letter."  she got up.  "i haven't written it yet.  why
shouldn't i post it, though?"  she sat down again.  "my head
is rather wretched.  i hope that none of your friends are
likely to come in."

tibby locked the door.  his friends often found it in
this condition.  then he asked whether anything had gone
wrong at evie's wedding.

"not there," said helen, and burst into tears.

he had known her hysterical--it was one of her aspects
with which he had no concern--and yet these tears touched
him as something unusual.  they were nearer the things that
did concern him, such as music.  he laid down his knife and
looked at her curiously.  then, as she continued to sob, he
went on with his lunch.

e time came for the second course, and she was still
crying.  apple charlotte was to follow, which spoils by
waiting.  "do you mind mrs. martlett coming in?" he asked,
"or shall i take it from her at the door?"

"could i bathe my eyes, tibby?"

he took her to his bedroom, and introduced the pudding
in her absence.  having helped himself, he put it down to
warm in the hearth.  his hand stretched towards the grammar,
and soon he was turning over the pages, raising his eyebrows
scornfully, perhaps at human nature, perhaps at chinese.  to
him thus employed helen returned.  she had pulled herself
together, but the grave appeal had not vanished from her eyes.

"now for the explanation," she said.  "why didn't i
begin with it?  i have fou

"i gather he has had a mistress," said tibby.

two notes came from her late that evening--one for me, one
for leonard, dismissing him with barely a reason.  i
couldn't understand.  then it comes out that mrs. bast had
spoken to mr. wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get
rooms, and was still speaking about him when leonard came
back to her.  this leonard knew all along.  he thought it
natural he should be ruined twice.  natural!  could you have
contained yourself?.

"it is certainly a very bad business," said tibby.

his reply seemed to calm his sister.  "i was afraid that
i saw it out of proportion.  but you are right outside it,
and you must know.  in a day or two--or perhaps a week--take
whatever steps you think fit.  i leave it in your hands."

she concluded her charge.

"the facts as they touch meg are all before you," she
added; and tibby sighed and felt it rather hard that,
because of his open mind, he should be empanelled to serve
as a juror.  he had never been interested in human beings,
for whic

ought margaret to know what helen knew the basts to know?
similar questions had vexed him from infancy, and at oxford
he had learned to say that the importance of human beings
has been vastly overrated by specialists.  the epigram, with
its faint whiff of the eighties, meant nothing.  but he
might have let it off now if his sister had not been
ceaselessly beautiful.

"you see, helen--have a cigarette--i don't see what i'm

"this part is in confidence," said helen.  "it has

i have already decided on the minimum sum.  as soon as
possible i am placing it to your account, and when i am in
germany you will pay it over for me.  i shall never forget
your kindness, tibbikins, if you do this."

"what is the sum?"

"five thousand."

"good god alive!" said tibby, and went crimson.

"now, what is the good of driblets?  to go through life
having done one thing--to have raised one person from the
abyss: not these puny gifts of shillings and
blankets--making the grey more grey.  no doubt people will
think me extraordinary."

"i don't care a damn what people think!" cried he,
heated to unusual manliness of diction.  "but it's half what
you have."

soiled skirt.  "i have far too much, and we settled at

it is convenient to follow him in the discharge of his
duties.  margaret summoned him the next day.  she was
terrified at helen's flight, and he had to say that she had
called in at oxford.  then she said: "did she seem worried
at any rumour about henry?"  he answered, "yes." "i knew it
was that!" she exclaimed.  "i'll write to her."  tibby was relieved.

he then sent the cheque to the address that helen gave
him, and stated that later on he was instructed to forward
five thousand pounds.  an answer came back, very civil and
quiet in tone--such an answer as tibby himself would have
given.  the cheque was returned, the legacy refused, the
writer being in no need of money.  tibby forwarded this to
helen, adding in the fulness of his heart that leonard bast
seemed somewhat a monumental person after all.  helen's
reply was frantic.  h

and had not mistaken culture for an end.

the furniture, with a few exceptions, went down into
hertfordshire, mr. wilcox having most kindly offered howards
end as a warehouse.  mr. bryce had died abroad--an
unsatisfactory affair--and as there seemed little guarantee
that the rent would be paid regularly, he cancelled the
agreement, and resumed possession himself.  until he relet
the house, the schlegels were welcome to stack their
furniture in the garage and lower rooms.  margaret demurred,
but tibby accepted the offer gladly; it saved him from
coming to any decision about the future.  the plate and the
more valuable pictures found a safer home in london, but the
bulk of the things went country-ways, and were entrusted to
the guardianship of miss avery.

shortly before the move, our hero and heroine were
married.  they have weathered the storm, and may reasonably
expect peace.  to have no illusions and yet to love--what
stronger surety can a woman find?  she had seen her
husband's past as w

lose a good charwoman for his wife.

margaret judged it better to settle the little trouble
herself.  parties were evidently ruffled.  with henry's
permission, she wrote a pleasant note to miss avery, asking
her to leave the cases untouched.  then, at the first
convenient opportunity, she went down herself, intending to
repack her belongings and store them properly in the local
warehouse: the plan had been amateurish and a failure.
tibby promised to accompany her, but at the last moment
begged to be excused.  so, for the second time in her life,
she entered the house alone.


chapter 33

the day of her visit was exquisite, and the last of
unclouded happiness that she was to have for many months.
her anxiety about helen's extraordinary absence was still
dormant, and as for a possible brush with miss avery--that
only gave zest to the expedition.  she had also eluded
dolly's invitation to luncheon.  walking straight up from

it was a senseless remark, but with a queer feeling of
disloyalty margaret rose from her chair.  she felt that
henry had been obscurely censured.  they went into the
dining-room, where the sunlight poured in upon her mother's
chiffonier, and upstairs, where many an old god peeped from
a new niche.  the furniture fitted extraordinarily well.  in
the central room--over the hall, the room that helen had
slept in four years ago--miss avery had placed tibby's old
bassinette.

"the nursery," she said.

margaret turned away without speaking.

at last everything was seen.  the kitchen and lobby were
still stacked with furniture and straw, but, as far as she
could make out, nothing had been broken or scratched.  a
pathetic display of ingenuity!  then they took a friendly
stroll in the garden.  it had gone wild since her last
visit.  the gravel sweep was weedy, and grass had sprung up
at the very jaws of the garage.  and evie's rockery was only
bumps.

but before this could be done an unexpected trouble fell
upon her.


chapter 34

it was not unexpected entirely.  aunt juley's health had
been bad all the winter.  she had had a long series of colds
and coughs, and had been too busy to get rid of them.  she
had scarcely promised her niece "to really take my tiresome
chest in hand," when she caught a chill and developed acute
pneumonia.  margaret and tibby went down to swanage.  helen
was telegraphed for, and that spring party that after all
gathered in that hospitable house had all the pathos of fair
memories.  on a perfect day, when the sky seemed blue
porcelain, and the waves of the discreet little bay beat
gentlest of tattoos upon the sand, margaret hurried up
through the rhododendrons, confronted again by the
senselessness of death.  one death may explain itself, but
it throws no light upon another: the groping inquiry must
begin anew.  prea

th
odd little laughs and apologies for having stopped in it so
long.  she was very weak; she could not rise to the
occasion, or realize the great mystery which all agree must
await her; it only seemed to her that she was quite done
up--more done up than ever before; that she saw and heard
and felt less every moment; and that, unless something
changed, she would soon feel nothing.  her spare strength
she devoted to plans: could not margaret take some steamer
expeditions?  were mackerel cooked as tibby liked them?  she
worried herself about helen's absence, and also that she
could be the cause of helen's return.  the nurses seemed to
think such interests quite natural, and perhaps hers was an
average approach to the great gate.  but margaret saw death
stripped of any false romance; whatever the idea of death
may contain, the process can be trivial and hideous.

"important--margaret dear, take the lulworth when helen comes."

"helen won't be able to stop, aunt juley.  she has
telegraphed that

mrs. munt did not die.  quite outside her will, a more
dignified power took hold of her and checked her on the
downward slope.  she returned, without emotion, as fidgety
as ever.  on the fourth day she was out of danger.

"margaret--important," it went on: "i should like you to
have some companion to take walks with.  do try miss conder."

"i have been a little walk with miss conder."

"but she is not really interesting.  if only you had helen."

"i have tibby, aunt juley."

"no, but he has to do his chinese.  some real companion
is what you need.  really, helen is odd."

"helen is odd, very," agreed margaret.

"not content with going abroad, why does she want to go
back there at once?"

"no doubt she will change her mind when she sees us.
she has not the least balance."

that was the stock criticism about helen, but margaret's
voice trembled as she made it.  by now she was deeply pained
at her sister's behaviour.  it may be unbalanced to fly out

it was a tiresome letter, for it tempted margaret to
tell a lie.  if she wrote that aunt juley was still in
danger her sister would come.  unhealthiness is contagious.
we cannot be in contact with those who are in a morbid state
without ourselves deteriorating.  to "act for the best"
might do helen good, but would do herself harm, and, at the
risk of disaster, she kept her colours flying a little
longer.  she replied that their aunt was much better, and
awaited developments.

tibby approved of her reply.  mellowing rapidly, he was
a pleasanter companion than before.  oxford had done much
for him.  he had lost his peevishness, and could hide his
indifference to people and his interest in food.  but he had
not grown more human.  the years between eighteen and
twenty-two, so magical for most, were leading him gently
from boyhood to middle age.  he had never known
young-manliness, that quality which warms the heart till
death, and gives mr. wilcox an imperishable charm.  he w

was characteristic.

"why don't you tell mr. wilcox?"

"about helen?"

"perhaps he has come across that sort of thing."

"he would do all he could, but--"

"oh, you know best.  but he is practical."

it was the student's belief in experts.  margaret
demurred for one or two reasons.  presently helen's answer
came.  she sent a telegram requesting the address of the
furniture, as she would now return at once.  margaret
replied, "certainly not; meet me at the bankers at four."
she and tibby went up to london.  helen was not at the
bankers, and they were refused her address.  helen had
passed into chaos.

margaret put her arm round her brother.  he was all that
she had left, and never had he seemed more unsubstantial.

"tibby love, what next?"

he replied: "it is extraordinary."

"dear, your judgment's often clearer than mine.  have
you any notion what's at the back?"

"none, unless it's something mental."

"oh--that!" said margaret.  "quite impossible." but the
suggestion had been
 
 ___________________________
 
 uttered, and in a few minutes she took
it up herself.  nothing else explained.  and london agreed
with tibby.  the mask fell off the city, and she saw it for
what it really is--a caricature of infinity.  the familiar
barriers, the streets along which she moved, the houses
between which she had made her little journeys for so many
years, became negligible suddenly.  helen seemed one with
grimy trees and the traffic and the slowly-flowing slabs of
mud.  she had accomplished a hideous act of renunciation and
returned to the one.  margaret's own faith held firm.  she
knew the human soul will be merged, if
 
 ___________________________
 
 it be merged at all,
with the stars and the sea.  yet she felt that her sister
had been going amiss for many years.  it was symbolic the
catastrophe should come now, on a london afternoon, while
rain fell slowly.

henry was the only hope.  henry was definite.  he might
know of some paths in the chaos that were hidden from them,
and she determined to take tibby's advice and lay the whole
matter in his hands.  they must call at his office.  he
could not well make it worse.  she went for a few moments
into st. paul's, whose dome stands out of the welter so
bravely, as if preaching the gospel of form.  but within,
st.  paul's is as its surroundings--echoes and whispers,
inaudible songs, invisible mosaics, wet footmarks crossing
and recrossing the floor.  si monumentum requiris,
circumspice: it points us back to london.  there was no hope
of helen here.

henry was unsatisfactory at first.  that she had
expected.  he was overjoyed to see her back from swanage,
and slow to admit the growth of a new trouble.  when they
told him of their search, he only chaffed tibby and the
schlegels generally, and declared that it was "just like
helen" to lead her relatives a dance.

"that is what we all say," replied margaret.  "but why
should it be just like helen?  why should she be allowed to
be so queer, and to grow queerer?"

"don't ask me.  i'm a plain man of business.  i live and
let live.  my advice to you both is, don't worry.  margaret,
you've got black marks again under your eyes.  you know
that's strictly forbidden.  first your aunt--then your
sister.  no, we

 aren't going to have it.  are we,
theobald?"  he rang the bell.  "i'll give you some tea, and
then you go straight to ducie street.  i can't have my girl
looking as old as her husband."

"all the same, you have not quite seen our point," said tibby.

mr. wilcox, who was in good spirits, retorted, "i don't
suppose i ever shall."  he leant back, laughing at the
gifted but ridiculous family, while the fire flickered over
the map of africa.  margaret motioned to her brother to go
on.  rather diffident, he obeyed her.

"margaret's point is this," he said.  "our sister may be
mad."

charles, who was working in the inner room, looked round.

"come in, charles," said margaret kindly.  "could you
help us at all?  we are again in trouble."

"i'm af

raid i cannot.  what are the facts?  we are all
mad more or less, you know, in these days."

"the facts are as follows," replied tibby, who had at
times a pedantic lucidity.  "the facts are that she has been
in england for three days and will not see us.  she has
forbidden the bankers to give us her address.  she refuses
to answer questions.  margaret finds her letters
colourless.  there are other facts, but these are the most
striking."

"she has never behaved like this before, then?" asked henry.

"of course not!" said his wife, with a frown.

"well, my dear, how am i to know?"

a senseless spasm of annoyance came over her.

elf.  then you can meet her there."

"but, henry, that's just what she won't let me do.  it's
part of her--whatever it is--never to see me."

"of course you won't tell her you're going.  when she is
there, looking at the cases, you'll just stroll in.  if
nothing is wrong with her, so much the better.  but there'll
be the motor round the corner, and we can run her up to a
specialist in no time."

margaret shook her head.  "it's quite impossible."

"why?"

"it doesn't seem impossible to me," said tibby; "it is
surely a very tippy plan."

"it is impossible, because--" she looked at her husband
sadly.  "it's not the particular language that helen and i
talk if you see my meaning.  it would do splendidly for
other people, whom i don't blame."

"but helen doesn't talk," said tibby.  "that's our whole
difficulty.  she won't talk your particular language, and on
that account you think she's ill."

"no, henry; it's sweet of you, but i couldn't."

"i see," he said; "you have scruples."

"i suppose so

ood trying."

something had come between them.  perhaps it was
society, which henceforward would exclude helen.  perhaps it
was a third life, already potent as a spirit.  they could
find no meeting-place.  both suffered acutely, and were not
comforted by the knowledge that affection survived.

"look here, meg, is the coast clear?"

"you mean that you want to go away from me?"

"i suppose so--dear old lady!  it isn't any use.  i knew
we should have nothing to say.  give my love to aunt juley
and tibby, and take more yourself than i can say.  promise
to come and see me in munich later."

"certainly, dearest."

"for that is all we can do."

it seemed so.  most ghastly of all was helen's common
sense: monica had been extraordinarily good for her.

"i am glad to have seen you and the things."  she looked
at the bookcase lovingly, as if she was saying farewell to
the past.

margaret unbolted the door.  she remarked: "the car has
gone, and here's your cab."

she led the way to it, glancing at the

"ye-es.  the window's too high."

"try a drawing-room chair."

"no, i don't like the drawing-room so much.  the beam
has been match-boarded.  it would have been so beautiful
otherwise. "

"helen, what a memory you have for some things!  you're
perfectly right.  it's a room that men have spoilt through
trying to make it nice for women.  men don't know what we
want--"

"and never will."

"i don't agree.  in two thousand years they'll know."

"but the chairs show up wonderfully.  look where tibby
spilt the soup."

"coffee.  it was coffee surely."

helen shook her head.  "impossible.  tibby was far too
young to be given coffee at that time."

"was father alive?"

"yes."

"then you're right and it must have been soup.  i was
thinking of much later--that unsuccessful visit of aunt
juley's, when she didn't realize that tibby had grown up.
it was coffee then, for he threw it down on purpose.  there
was some rhyme, 'tea, coffee--coffee, tea,' that she said to
him every morning at breakfast.

wait a minute--how did it go?"

"i know--no, i don't.  what a detestable boy tibby was!"

"but the rhyme was simply awful.  no decent person could
have put up with it."

"ah, that greengage tree," cried helen, as if the garden
was also part of their childhood.  "why do i connect it with
dumbbells?  and there come the chickens.  the grass wants
cutting.  i love yellow-hammers--"

margaret interrupted her.  "i have got it," she
announced.

  'tea, tea, coffee, tea,<br>

"that every morning for three weeks.  no wonder tibby

"the house will be locked up then."

"in the morning would i bring eggs, too?"

"are you the boy whom i saw playing in the stacks last week?"

the child hung his head.

"well, run away and do it again."

"nice little boy," whispered helen.  "i say, what's your
name?  mine's helen."

"tom."

that was helen all over.  the wilcoxes, too, would ask a
child its name, but they never told their names in return.

"tom, this one here is margaret.  and at home we've
another called tibby."

"mine are lop-eared," replied tom, supposing tibby to be
a rabbit.

"you're a very good and rather a clever little boy.
mind you come again.--isn't he charming?"

"undoubtedly," said margaret. "he is probably the son of
madge, and madge is dreadful.  but this place has wonderful powers."

"what do you mean?"

"i don't know."

"because i probably agree with you."

"it kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live."

"i do agree," said helen, as she sipped the milk.  "but

husband.  my rule through life has been never to pay the
least attention to threats, and i can only repeat what i
said before: i do not give you and your sister leave to
sleep at howards end."

margaret loosed his hands.  he went into the house,
wiping first one and then the other on his handkerchief.
for a little she stood looking at the six hills, tombs of
warriors, breasts of the spring.  then she passed out into
what was now the evening.


chapter 39

charles and tibby met at ducie street, where the latter was
staying.  their interview was short and absurd.  they had
nothing in common but the english language, and tried by its
help to express what neither of them understood.  charles
saw in helen the family foe.  he had singled her out as the
most dangerous of the schlegels, and, angry as he was,
looked forward to telling his wife how right he had been.
his mind was made up at once: the girl must be got out of
the way before she disgraced them farther.  if oc

sitor.  as if they were heads
in a note-book, he ran through all the incidents of the
schlegels' campaign: the attempt to compromise his brother,
his mother's legacy, his father's marriage, the introduction
of the furniture, the unpacking of the same.  he had not yet
heard of the request to sleep at howards end; that was to be
their master-stroke and the opportunity for his.  but he
already felt that howards end was the objective, and, though
he disliked the house, was determined to defend it.

tibby, on the other hand, had no opinions.  he stood
above the conventions: his sister had a right to do what she
thought right.  it is not difficult to stand above the
conventions when we leave no hostages among them; men can
always be more unconventional than women, and a bachelor of
independent means need encounter no difficulties at all.
unlike charles, tibby had money enough; his ancestors had
earned it for him, and if he shocked the people in one set
of lodgings he had only to move into another

.  his was the
leisure without sympathy--an attitude as fatal as the
strenuous: a little cold culture may be raised on it, but no
art.  his sisters had seen the family danger, and had never
forgotten to discount the gold islets that raised them from
the sea.  tibby gave all the praise to himself, and so
despised the struggling and the submerged.

hence the absurdity of the interview; the gulf between
them was economic as well as spiritual.  but several facts
passed: charles pressed for them with an impertinence that
the undergraduate could not withstand.  on what date had
helen gone abroad?  to whom?  (charles was anxious to fasten
the scandal on germany.) then, changing his tactics, he said
roughly: "i suppose you realize that you are your sister's

ctor?"

"in what sense?"

"if a man played about with my sister, i'd send a bullet
through him, but perhaps you don't mind."

"i mind very much," protested tibby.

"who d'ye suspect, then?  speak out, man.  one always
suspects someone."

"no one.  i don't think so." involuntarily he blushed.
he had remembered the scene in his oxford rooms.

"you are hiding something," said charles.  as interviews
go, he got the best of this one.  "when you saw her last,
did she mention anyone's name?  yes, or no!" he thundered,
so that tibby started.

"in my rooms she mentioned some friends, called the basts--"

"who are the basts?"

"people--friends of hers at evie's w

edding."

"i don't remember.  but, by great scott!  i do.  my aunt
told me about some tag-rag.  was she full of them when you
saw her?  is there a man?  did she speak of the man?
or--look here--have you had any dealings with him?"

tibby was silent.  without intending it, he had betrayed
his sister's confidence; he was not enough interested in
human life to see where things will lead to.  he had a
strong regard for honesty, and his word, once given, had
always been kept up to now.  he was deeply vexed, not only
for the harm he had done helen, but for the flaw he had
discovered in his own equipment.

"i see--you are in his confidence.  they met at your
rooms.  oh, what a family, what a family!  god help the poor
pater--"

with his back propped against the wall.  when the
parlourmaid came he could not see her face; the brown rain
had descended suddenly.

"does mrs. wilcox live here?" he asked.

"she's out," was the answer.

"when will she be back?"

"i'll ask," said the parlourmaid.

margaret had given instructions that no one who
mentioned her name should ever be rebuffed.  putting the
door on the chain--for leonard's appearance demanded
this--she went through to the smoking-room, which was
occupied by tibby.  tibby was asleep.  he had had a good
lunch.  charles wilcox had not yet rung him up for the
distracting interview.  he said drowsily: "i don't know.

"i'll ask, sir."

"no, don't bother."

"they have taken the car to howards end," said the
parlourmaid to leonard.

he thanked her, and asked whereabouts that place was.

"you appear to want to know a good deal," she remarked.
but margaret had forbidden her to be mysterious.  she told
him against her better judg
