[CHARACTER] - 
                	[CHARACTER]
is a cynical scholar whom candide befriends as a travel companion.
[CHARACTER] has suffered a great deal in his life and preaches a philosophy
of undiluted pessimism. more knowledgeable and intelligent than either
candide or pangloss, [CHARACTER] is nonetheless a flawed philosopher.
because he always expects nothing but the worst from the world,
he often has trouble seeing the world as it really is.
