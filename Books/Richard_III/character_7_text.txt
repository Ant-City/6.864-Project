  son. good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
  duchess. no, boy.
  daughter. why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
    and cry 'o clarence, my unhappy son!'?
  son. why do you look on us, and shake your head,
    and call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
    if that our noble father were alive?
  duchess. my pretty cousins, you mistake me both;
    i do lament the sickness of the king,

argaret

  queen margaret. so now prosperity begins to mellow
    and drop into the rotten mouth of death.
    here in these confines slily have i lurk'd
    to watch the waning of mine enemies.
    a dire induction am i witness to,
    and will to france, hoping the consequence
    will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
    withdraw thee, wretched margaret. who comes here?
                                                       [retires]

           enter queen elizabeth and the duchess of york

  queen elizabeth. ah, my poor princes! ah, my tender
    babes!
    my unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
    if yet your gentle souls fly in the air
    and be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
    hover about me with your airy wings
    and hear your mother's lamentation.
  queen margaret. hover about her; say that right for right
    hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
  duchess. so many miseries have craz'd my voice
    that my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.
