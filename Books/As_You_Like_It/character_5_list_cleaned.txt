[CHARACTER] - 
                 the
brother of duke senior and usurper of his throne. [CHARACTER]'s
cruel nature and volatile temper are displayed when he banishes
his niece, rosalind, from court without reason. that celia, his own
daughter, cannot mitigate his unfounded anger demonstrates the intensity
of the duke's hatefulness. frederick mounts an army against his
exiled brother but aborts his vengeful mission after he meets an
old religious man on the road to the forest of ardenne. he immediately
changes his ways, dedicating himself to a monastic life and returning
the crown to his brother, thus testifying to the ease and elegance
with which humans can sometimes change for the better.
