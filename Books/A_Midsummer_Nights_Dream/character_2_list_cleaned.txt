[CHARACTER] - 
                the
beautiful queen of the fairies, [CHARACTER] resists the attempts of
her husband, oberon, to make a knight of the young indian prince
that she has been given. [CHARACTER]'s brief, potion-induced love for
nick bottom, whose head puck has transformed into that of an ass, yields
the play's foremost example of the contrast motif.
