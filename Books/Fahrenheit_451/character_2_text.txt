 hair and soot-coloured brows and bluish-ash-smeared cheeks where they had 
shaven close; but their heritage showed. montag started up, his mouth opened. had he ever seen 
a fireman that didn't have black hair, black brows, a fiery face, and a blue-steel shaved but 
unshaved look? these men were all mirror-images of himself! were all firemen picked then for 
their looks as well as their proclivities? the colour of cinders and ash about them, and the 
continual smell of burning from their pipes. captain beatty there, rising in thunderheads of 
tobacco smoke. beatty opening a fresh tobacco packet, crumpling the cellophane into a sound of 
fire. 

montag looked at the cards in his own hands. "i-i've been thinking. about the fire last week. 
about the man whose library we fixed. what happened to him?" 
"they took him screaming off to the asylum" 



"he. wasn't insane." 

beatty arranged his cards quietly. "any man's insane who thinks he can fool the government and 

us." " 

"i've tried to imagine," sa

"no," she said. "thank you, anyway." 

"i'm counting to ten," said beatty. "one. two." 

"please," said montag. 

"go on," said the woman. 

"three. four." 

"here." montag pulled at the woman. 

the woman replied quietly, "i want to stay here" 

"five. six." 

"you can stop counting," she said. she opened the fingers of one hand slightly and in the palm of 

the hand was a single slender object. 

an ordinary kitchen match. 

the sight of it rushed the men out and down away from the house. captain beatty, keeping his 

dignity, backed slowly through the front door, his pink face burnt and shiny from a thousand 

fires and night excitements. god, thought montag, how true! always at night the alarm comes. 

never by day! is it because the fire is prettier by night? more spectacle, a better show? the pink 

face of beatty now showed the faintest panic in the door. the woman's hand twitched on the 

single matchstick. the fumes of kerosene bloomed up about her. montag felt the hidden book

moving in their mouths when they talked. but that was another mildred, that was a mildred so 

deep inside this one, and so bothered, really bothered, that the two women had never met. he 

turned away. 

mildred said, "well, now you've done it. out front of the house. look who's here.". 

"i don't care." 

"there's a phoenix car just driven up and a man in a black shirt with an orange snake stitched on 

his arm coming up the front walk." 

"captain beauty?" he said, 

"captain beatty." 

montag did not move, but stood looking into the cold whiteness of the wall immediately before 

him. 

"go let him in, will you? tell him i'm sick." 

"tell him yourself! " she ran a few steps this way, a few steps that, and stopped, eyes wide, when 

the front door speaker called her name, softly, softly, mrs. montag, mrs. montag, someone here, 

someone here, mrs. montag, mrs. montag, someone's here. fading. 

montag made sure the book was well hidden behind the pillow, climbed slowly bac

k into bed, 

arranged the covers over his knees and across his chest, half-sitting, and after a while mildred 

moved and went out of the room and captain beatty strolled in, his hands in his pockets. 

"shut the 'relatives' up," said beatty, looking around at everything except montag and his wife. 

this time, mildred ran. the yammering voices stopped yelling in the parlour. 



captain beatty sat down in the most comfortable chair with a peaceful look on his ruddy face. 

he took time to prepare and light his brass pipe and puff out a great smoke cloud. "just thought 

i'd come by and see how the sick man is." 

"how'd you guess?" 

beatty smiled his smile which showed the candy pinkness of his gums and the tiny candy 

whiteness of his teeth. "i've seen it all. you were going to call for a night off." 

montag sat in bed. 

"well," said beatty, "take the night off!" he examined his

ll of blue electricity blowing under the locked door. 

"let's get back to work," said montag quietly. 

mildred kicked at a book. "books aren't people. you read and i look around, but there isn't 

anybody!" 

he stared at the parlour that was dead and grey as the waters of an ocean that might teem with 

life if they switched on the electronic sun. 

"now," said mildred, "my "family' is people. they tell me things; i laugh, they laugh! and the 

colours ! " 

"yes, i know." 

"and besides, if captain beatty knew about those booksâ€”" she thought about it. her face grew 

amazed and then horrified. "he might come and bum the house and the "family.' that's awful! 

think of our investment. why should i read? what for?" 

"what for! why!" said montag. "i saw the damnedest snake in the world the other night. it was 

dead but it was alive. it could see but it couldn't see. you want to see that snake. it's at 

emergency hospital where they filed a report on all the junk the snake got out of you! would

faber hung up. 

montag put down the phone. none. a thing he knew of course from the firehouse listings. but 

somehow he had wanted to hear it from faber himself. 

in the hall mildred's face was suffused with excitement. "well, the ladies are coming over!" 

montag showed her a book. "this is the old and new testament, and-" 

"don't start that again!" 

"it might be the last copy in this part of the world." 

"you've got to hand it back tonight, don't you know? captain beatty knows you've got it, doesn't 

he?" 

"i don't think he knows which book i stole. but how do i choose a substitute? do i turn in mr. 

jefferson? mr. thoreau? which is least valuable? if i pick a substitute and beatty does know 

which book i stole, he'll guess we've an entire library here!" 



mildred's mouth twitched. "see what you're doing? you'll ruin us! who's more important, me or 

that bible?" she was beginning to shriek now, sitting there like a wax doll melting in its own 

heat.

comfort and a minimum of chance. see how safe i play it, how contemptible i am?" 

montag placed the green bullet in his ear. the old man inserted a similar object in his own ear 

and moved his lips. 

"montag! " 

the voice was in montag's head. 

"i hear you!" 

the old man laughed. "you're coming over fine, too!" faber whispered, but the voice in 

montag's head was clear. "go to the firehouse when it's time. i'll be with you. let's listen to this 

captain beatty together. he could be one of us. god knows. i'll give you things to say. we'll 

give him a good show. do you hate me for this electronic cowardice of mine? here i am sending 

you out into the night, while i stay behind the lines with my damned ears listening for you to get 

your head chopped off." 

"we all do what we do," said montag. he put the bible in the old man's hands. "here. i'll chance 

turning in a substitute. tomorrow--" 

"i'll see the unemployed printer, yes; that much i can do

"montag, old men who stay at home, afraid, tending their peanut-brittle bones, have no right to 
criticize. yet you almost killed things at the start. watch it! i'm with you, remember that. i 
understand how it happened. i must admit that your blind raging invigorated me. god, how 
young i felt! but now-i want you to feel old, i want a little of my cowardice to be distilled in you 
tonight. the next few hours, when you see captain beatty, tiptoe round him, let me hear him for 
you, let me feel the situation out. survival is our ticket. forget the poor, silly women ...." 
"i made them unhappier than they have been in years, ithink," said montag. "it shocked me to 
see mrs. phelps cry. maybe they're right, maybe it's best not to face things, to run, have fun. i 
don't know. i feel guilty--" 

"no, you mustn't! if there were no war, if there was peace in the world, i'd say fine, have fun! 
but, montag, you mustn't go back to being

most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom, the solid unmoving cattle of the majority. oh, god, 

the terrible tyranny of the majority. we all have our harps to play. and it's up to you now to 

know with which ear you'll listen." 

montag opened his mouth to answer faber and was saved this error in the presence of others 

when the station bell rang. the alarm-voice in the ceiling chanted. there was a tacking-tacking 

sound as the alarm-report telephone typed out the address across the room. captain beatty, his 

poker cards in one pink hand, walked with exaggerated slowness to the phone and ripped out the 

address when the report was finished. he glanced perfunctorily at it, and shoved it in his pocket. 

he came back and sat down. the others looked at him. 

"it can wait exactly forty seconds while i take all the money away from you," said beatty, 

happily. 

montag put his cards down. 

"tired, montag? going out of this game?" 



"yes." 

"hold on. well, come to think of it, we can finish t
