Celia - 
                	The
daughter of Duke Frederick and Rosalind's dearest friend. Celia's
devotion to Rosalind is unmatched, as evidenced by her decision
to follow her cousin into exile. To make the trip, Celia assumes
the disguise of a simple shepherdess and calls herself Aliena. As elucidated
by her extreme love of Rosalind and her immediate devotion to Oliver,
whom she marries at the end of the play, Celia possesses a loving
heart, but is prone to deep, almost excessive emotions.
