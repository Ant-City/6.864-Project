stronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his
bodily strength, that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who
are weaker than he is, and right and just for us?

that's abominable of you, socrates; you take the words in the sense
which is most damaging to the argument.

not at all, my good sir, i said; i am trying to understand them; and i
wish that you would be a little clearer.

well, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ;
there are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are
aristocracies?

yes, i know.

and the government is the ruling power in each state?

certainly.

and the different forms of government make laws democratical,
aristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests;
and these laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the
justice which they deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses
them they punish as a breaker of the law, an

never mind, i replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept his
statement. tell me, thrasymachus, i said, did you mean by justice what
the stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?

certainly not, he said. do you suppose that i call him who is mistaken
the stronger at the time when he is mistaken?

yes, i said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that
the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.

you argue like an informer, socrates. do you mean, for example, that he
who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?
or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or
grammarian at the time when he is making the mistake, in respect of the
mistake? true, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian
has made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is
that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a
mistake in so far as he is

e is commonly said to err, and i adopted the
common mode of speaking. but to be perfectly accurate, since you are
such a lover of accuracy, we should say that the ruler, in so far as he
is a ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring, always commands that which
is for his own interest; and the subject is required to execute his
commands; and therefore, as i said at first and now repeat, justice is
the interest of the stronger.

indeed, thrasymachus, and do i really appear to you to argue like an
informer?

certainly, he replied.

and do you suppose that i ask these questions with any design of
injuring you in the argument?

nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word--i know it; but you will be
found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.

i shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any
misunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what
sense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were
saying, he being the superior, it is j

term?

in the strictest of all senses, he said. and now cheat and play the

be able, never.

and do you imagine, i said, that i am such a madman as to try and cheat,
thrasymachus? i might as well shave a lion.

why, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.

enough, i said, of these civilities. it will be better that i should ask
you a question: is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which
you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? and remember
that i am now spe

the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other losses,
and getting nothing out of the public, because he is just; moreover he
is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them in
unlawful ways. but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man.
i am speaking, as before, of injustice on a large scale in which the
advantage of the unjust is most apparent; and my meaning will be most
clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the
criminal is the happiest of men, and the sufferers or those who refuse
to do injustice are the most miserable--that is to say tyranny, which by
fraud and force takes away the property of others, not little by little
but wholesale; comprehending in one, things sacred as well as profane,
private and public; for which acts of wrong, if he were detected
perpetrating any one of them singly, he would be punished and incur
great disgrace--they who do such wrong in particular

certainly, he confers a benefit.

then now, thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts
nor governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before
saying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who
are the weaker and not the stronger--to their good they attend and
not to the good of the superior. and this is the reason, my dear
thrasymachus, why, as i was just now saying, no one is willing to
govern; because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils
which are not his concern without remuneration. for, in the execution of
his work, and in giving his orders to another, the true artist does not
regard his own interest, but always that of his subjects; and therefore
in order that rulers may be willing to rule, they must be paid in one of
three modes of payment, money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing.

what do you mean, socrates? said glaucon. the first two modes of payment
are intelligible enough, but what the penalty is i d

those of which i was just now speaking.

i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning, thrasymachus, i
replied; but still i cannot hear without amazement that you class
injustice with wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.

certainly i do so class them.

now, i said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground;
for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had
been admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer
might have been given to you on received principles; but now i perceive
that you will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust
you will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before
to the just, seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with
wisdom and virtue.

you have guessed most infallibly, he replied.

then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the
argument so long as i have reason to think that you, thrasymachus, are

can exist or be exercised without justice or only with justice.

if you are right in your view, and justice is wisdom, then only with
justice; but if i am right, then without justice.

i am delighted, thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent and
dissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.

that is out of civility to you, he replied.

you are very kind, i said; and would you have the goodness also to
inform me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of
robbers and thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if
they injured one another?

no indeed, he said, they could not.

but if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act
together better?

yes.

and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and
fighting, and justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true,
thrasymachus?

i agree, he said, because i do not wish to quarrel with y

just will best appear if we imagine something
of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power to do
what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them;
then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be
proceeding along the same road, following their interest, which all
natures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the path of
justice by the force of law. the liberty which we are supposing may be
most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said
to have been possessed by gyges, the ancestor of croesus the lydian.
according to the tradition, gyges was a shepherd in the service of
the king of lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake made an
opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock. amazed
at the sight, he descended into the opening, where, among other marvels,
he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors, at which he stooping and
looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appear

ore profitable to the individual than
justice, and he who argues as i have been supposing, will say that they
are right. if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming
invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what was another's, he
would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most wretched idiot, although
they would praise him to one another's faces, and keep up appearances
with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice.
enough of this.

now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and
unjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the
isolation to be effected? i answer: let the unjust man be entirely
unjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from
either of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work
of their respective lives. first, let the unjust be like other
distinguished masters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician, who
knows intuitively his own powers and keeps

 and command of money and friends. and at
his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity,
wishing, as aeschylus says, to be and not to seem good. there must be no
seeming, for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded, and
then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or
for the sake of honours and rewards; therefore, let him be clothed in
justice only, and have no other covering; and he must be imagined in a
state of life the opposite of the former. let him be the best of men,
and let him be thought the worst; then he will have been put to the
proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of
infamy and its consequences. and let him continue thus to the hour of
death; being just and seeming to be unjust. when both have reached the
uttermost extreme, the one of justice and the other of injustice, let
judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two.

and a tedious and uphill road: then citing homer as a witness that the
gods may be influenced by men; for he also says:--

'the gods, too, may be turned from their purpose; and men pray to them
and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by
libations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed.'

and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus,
who were children of the moon and the muses--that is what they
say--according to which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only
individuals, but whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin
may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and
are equally at the service of the living and the dead; the latter sort
they call mysteries, and they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if
we neglect them no one knows what awaits us.

he proceeded: and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and
vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are

they will.

not to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?

yes.

then we shall want merchants?

we shall.

and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors will
also be needed, and in considerable numbers?

yes, in considerable numbers.

then, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?
to secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our
principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a
state.

clearly they will buy and sell.

then they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes of
exchange.

certainly.

suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production
to market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with
him,--is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?

not at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake
the office of salesmen. in well-ordered states

painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion, and gold and

true, he said.

then we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy state is
no longer sufficient. now will the city have to fill and swell with a
multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want; such
as the whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class
have to do with forms and colours; another will be the votaries of
music--poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists, players, dancers,
contractors; also makers of divers kinds of articles, including women's
dresses. and we shall want more servants. will not tutors be also in
request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well as
confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed and
therefore had no place in the former edition of our state, but are
needed now? they must not be forgot

now, i said, that we begin by telling children stories which,
though not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious;
and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn
gymnastics.

very true.

that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before
gymnastics.

quite right, he said.

you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work,
especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the time
at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is
more readily taken.

quite true.

and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales
which may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds
ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish
them to have when they are grown up?

we cannot.

then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of
fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good,
and reject the bad; and w

indelible and unalterable; and therefore it is most important that the
tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts.

there you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such
models to be found and of what tales are you speaking--how shall we
answer him?

i said to him, you and i, adeimantus, at this moment are not poets,
but founders of a state: now the founders of a state ought to know the
general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits
which must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their
business.

very true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you mean?

something of this kind, i replied:--god is always to be represented as
he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, in
which the representation is given.

right.

and is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as such?

certainly.

but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be
strenuously denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or

such a fiction is suicidal, ruinous, impious.

i agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to the law.

let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods, to
which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform,--that god is
not the author of all things, but of good only.

that will do, he said.

and what do you think of a second principle? shall i ask you whether god
is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape,
and now in another--sometimes himself changing and passing into
many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such
transformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own
proper image?

i cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.

things--furniture, houses, garments: when good and well made, they are
least altered by time and circumstances.

very true.

then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both,
is least liable to suffer change from without?

true.

but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect?

of course they are.

then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many
shapes?

he cannot.

but may he not change and transform himself?

clearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.

and will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the
worse and more unsightly?

if he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot
suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.

very true, adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether god or man,
desire to make himself worse?

impossible.

then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change; being,
as is supposed, t

he fairest and best that is conceivable, every god
remains absolutely and for ever in his own form.

that necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.

then, i said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that

'the gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands, walk up
and down cities in all sorts of forms;'

and let no one slander proteus and thetis, neither let any one, either
in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry, introduce here disguised in
the likeness of a priestess asking an alms

'for the life-giving daughters of inachus the river of argos;'

--let us have no more lies of that sort. neither must we have mothers
under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad
version of these myths--telling how certain gods, as they say, 'go about
by night in the likeness of so many

 strangers and in divers forms;' but
let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children, and at the
same time speak blasphemy against the gods.

heaven forbid, he said.

but although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft
and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms?

perhaps, he replied.

well, but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie, whether in
word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?

i cannot say, he replied.

do you not know, i said, that the true lie, if such an expression may be
allowed, is hated of gods and men?

what do you mean? he said.

i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and
highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters; there,
above all, he is most afraid of a lie hav

still, he said, i do not comprehend you.

the reason is, i replied, that you attribute some profound meaning to
my words; but i am only saying that deception, or being deceived
or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of
themselves, which is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to
hold the lie, is what mankind least like;--that, i say, is what they
utterly detest.

there is nothing more hateful to them.

and, as i was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him who
is deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only a
kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul,
not pure unadulterated falsehood.

friends who are senseless or mad?

but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god.

then no motive can be imagined why god should lie?

none whatever.

then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?

yes.

then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes
not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking vision.

your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own.

you agree with me then, i said, that this is the second type or form in
which we should write and speak about divine things. the gods are not
magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in
any way.

i grant that.

then, although we are admirers of homer, we do not admire the lying
dream which zeus sends to agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses
of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials

'was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long,
and to know no sickness. and when he had spoken of my lot

then, i said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages,
beginning with the verses,

rule over all the dead who have come to nought.'

we must also expunge the verse, which tells us how pluto feared,

'lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should be seen
both of mortals and immortals.'

and again:--

'o heavens! verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form
but no mind at all!'

again of tiresias:--

'(to him even after death did persephone grant mind,) that he alone
should be wise; but the other souls are flitting shades.'

again:--

'the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades, lamenting her fate,
leaving manhood and youth.'

again:--

'and the soul, with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the earth.'

narrative of his insolence to apollo, where he says,

'thou hast wronged me, o far-darter, most abominable of deities. verily
i would be even with thee, if i had only the power;'

or his insubordination to the river-god, on whose divinity he is ready
to lay hands; or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair,
which had been previously dedicated to the other river-god spercheius,
and that he actually performed this vow; or that he dragged hector round
the tomb of patroclus, and slaughtered the captives at the pyre; of all
this i cannot believe that he was guilty, any more than i can allow
our citizens to believe that he, the wise cheiron's pupil, the son of a
goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent
from zeus, was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave
of two seemingly inconsistent passions, meanness, not untainted by

im; whereupon
chryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger of the god against the
achaeans. now as far as these lines,

'and he prayed all the greeks, but especially the two sons of atreus,
the chiefs of the people,'

the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose
that he is any one else. but in what follows he takes the person of
chryses, and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the
speaker is not homer, but the aged priest himself. and in this double
form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at
troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey.

yes.

and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites
from time to time and in the intermediate passages?

quite true.

but when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say that
he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs you,
is going to speak?

certainly.

and this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voi

 as, for example, the writers of tragedy
and comedy--did you not just now call them imitations?

yes, i did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot
succeed in both.

any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?

true.

neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things are
but imitations.

they are so.

and human nature, adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet
smaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well, as
of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.

quite true, he replied.

if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that
our guardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate
themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state, making
this their craft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this
end, they ought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they
imitate at all, they should imitate from youth upward only those
characters which

body, voice, and mind?

yes, certainly, he said.

then, i said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of
whom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether
young or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting
against the gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she is in
affliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in
sickness, love, or labour.

very right, he said.

neither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the
offices of slaves?

they must not.

and surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the
reverse of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or
revile one another in drink or out of drink, or who in any other manner
sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as the
manner of such is. neither should they be trained to imitate the action
or speech of men or women who are mad or bad; for madness, like vice, is
to be known but not to be practised o

n,--i should
imagine that he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of
this sort of imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the
good man when he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when
he is overtaken by illness or love or drink, or has met with any other
disaster. but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him, he
will not make a study of that; he will disdain such a person, and will
assume his likeness, if at all, for a moment only when he is performing
some good action; at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which
he has never practised, nor will he like to fashion and frame himself
after the baser models; he feels the employment of such an art, unless
in jest, to be beneath him, and his mind revolts at it.

so i should expect, he replied.

then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated
out of homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and
narrative; but there will be very little of the former, an

ch the same in style, and he will keep
within the limits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great),
and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?

that is quite true, he said.

whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of
rhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the style
has all sorts of changes.

that is also perfectly true, he replied.

and do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all
poetry, and every form of expression in words? no one can say anything
except in one or other of them or in both together.

they include all, he said.

and shall we receive into our state all the three styles, or one only of
the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?

i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.

yes, i said, adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: and
indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you,
is the most popular style with childr

shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a
husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a
soldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?

true, he said.

and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are so
clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a proposal
to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship him as
a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also inform him that
in our state such as he are not permitted to exist; the law will not
allow them. and so when we have anointed him with myrrh, and set a
garland of wool upon his head, we shall send him away to another city.
for we mean to employ for our souls' health the rougher and severer poet
or story-teller, who will imitate the style of the virtuous only, and
will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the
education of our soldiers.

we certainly will, he said, if we have t

be consistent with ourselves.

i fear, said glaucon, laughing, that the word 'every one' hardly
includes me, for i cannot at the moment say what they should be; though
i may guess.

at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts--the words,
the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge i may presuppose?

yes, he said; so much as that you may.

and as for the words, there will surely be no difference between words
which are and which are not set to music; both will conform to the same
laws, and these have been already determined by us?

yes.

and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?

certainly.

we were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no need
of lamentation and strains of sorrow?

true.

and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow? you are musical, and
can tell me.

the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian, and the
full-toned or bass lydian, and such like.

these then, i said, must be banished; even to

but shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only to
be required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on
pain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our state? or is the

and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other
creative arts; and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be
prevented from practising his art in our state, lest the taste of our
citizens be corrupted by him? we would not have our guardians grow up
amid images of moral deformity, as in some noxious pasture, and there
browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little

educate, can ever become musical until we and they know the essential
forms of temperance, courage, liberality, magnificence, and their
kindred, as well as the contrary forms, in all their combinations,
and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found, not
slighting them either in small things or great, but believing them all
to be within the sphere of one art and study.

are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who has

hero eurypylus, after he has been wounded in homer, drinks a posset of
pramnian wine well besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese, which
are certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of asclepius who were
at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink, or
rebuke patroclus, who is treating his case.

well, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a
person in his condition.

not so extraordinary, i replied, if you bear in mind that in former
days, as is commonly said, before the time of herodicus, the guild of
asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine, which may be
said to educate diseases. but herodicus, being a trainer, and himself of
a sickly constitution, by a combination of training and doctoring found
out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself, and secondly the rest
of the world.

how was that? he said.

by the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease which
he perpetually tended, and a

habits, and either gets well and lives and does his business, or, if his
constitution fails, he dies and has no more trouble.

yes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of
medicine thus far only.

has he not, i said, an occupation; and what profit would there be in his
life if he were deprived of his occupation?

quite true, he said.

but with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that he
has any specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would
live.

he is generally supposed to have nothing to do.

then you never heard of the saying of phocylides, that as soon as a man
has a livelihood he should practise virtue?

nay, he said, i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.

let us not have a dispute with him about this, i said; but rather ask
ourselves: is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man, or
can he live without it? and if obligatory on him, then let us raise
a further question, whether this dieting o

 the mind, and the mind which has become and is sick can cure
nothing.

that is very true, he said.

but with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind; he
ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to
have associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through
the whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer
the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own
self-consciousness; the honourable mind which is to form a healthy
judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits
when young. and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to
be simple, and are easily practised upon by the dishonest, because they
have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.

yes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.

therefore, i said, the judge should not be young; he should have learned
to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation
of the nature of evil

d you are quite right.

and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change
their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the
sterner influence of fear?

yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.

therefore, as i was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best
guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest
of the state is to be the rule of their lives. we must watch them from
their youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are
most likely to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is
not deceived is to be selected, and he who fails in the trial is to be
rejected. that will be the way?

yes.

and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for
them, in which they will be made to give further proof of the same
qualities.

very right, he replied.

and then, i said, we must try them with enchantments--that is the third
sort of test--and see what will be their behavio

i replied, at my hesitation when you have heard.

speak, he said, and fear not.

well then, i will speak, although i really know not how to look you
in the face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which
i propose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the
soldiers, and lastly to the people. they are to be told that their youth
was a dream, and the education and training which they received from
us, an appearance only; in reality during all that time they were being
formed and fed in the womb of the earth, where they themselves and their
arms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were completed, the
earth, their mother, sent them up; and so, their country being their
mother and also their nurse, they are bound to advise for her good, and
to defend her against attacks, and her citizens they are to regard as
children of the earth and their own brothers.

you had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you were
going to tell.

tling them.

also, i said, the state, if once started well, moves with accumulating
force like a wheel. for good nurture and education implant good
constitutions, and these good constitutions taking root in a good
education improve more and more, and this improvement affects the breed
in man as in other animals.

very possibly, he said.

then to sum up: this is the point to which, above all, the attention of
our rulers should be directed,--that music and gymnastic be preserved in
their original form, and no innovation made. they must do their utmost
to maintain them intact. and when any one says that mankind most regard

'the newest song which the singers have,'

they will be afraid that he may be praising, not new songs, but a new
kind of song; and this ought not to be praised, or conceived to be the
meaning of the poet; for any musical innovation is full of danger to the
whole state, and ought to be prohibited. so damon tells me, and i
can quite believe him;--he says that when modes of m

usic change, the
fundamental laws of the state always change with them.

yes, said adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to damon's and your
own.

then, i said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress
in music?

yes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in.

yes, i replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears
harmless.

why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by
little this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates
into manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades
contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to laws and
constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last, socrates, by an
overthrow of all rights, private as well as public.

is that true? i said.

the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are

what do you mean? i said; you should have more feeling for them. when a
man cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare
that he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?

nay, he said, certainly not in that case.

well, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as a
play, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing; they
are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds
in contracts, and the other rascalities which i was mentioning, not
knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra?

yes, he said; that is just what they are doing.

i conceive, i said, that the true legislator will not trouble
himself with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the
constitution either in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered state; for

contriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the
laws in perfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and
of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture
and training, not to be washed away by such potent lyes as
pleasure--mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye;
or by sorrow, fear, and desire, the mightiest of all other solvents. and
this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity with
law about real and false dangers i call and maintain to be courage,
unless you disagree.

but i agree, he replied; for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere
uninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave--this,
in your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to
have another name.

most certainly.

then i may infer courage to be such as you describe?

you will not be far wrong;--h

he is temperate who has these same elements
in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and
the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason
ought to rule, and do not rebel?

certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in
the state or individual.

and surely, i said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue
of what quality a man will be just.

that is very certain.

and is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or
is she the same which we found her to be in the state?

there is no difference in my opinion, he said.

because, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few commonplace
instances will satisfy us of the truth of what i am saying.

what sort of instances do you mean?

if the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just state, or
the man who is trained in the principles of such a state, will be less
likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?

and the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business,
whether in ruling or being ruled?

exactly so.

are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such
states is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?

not i, indeed.

then our dream has been realized; and the suspicion which we entertained
at the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power
must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been
verified?

yes, certainly.

and the division of labour which required the carpenter and the
shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own
business, and not another's, was a shadow of justice, and for that
reason it was of use?

clearly.

but in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned
however, not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the
true self and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit the
several
 
 ___________________________
 
we say so, then?

let us say so.

and now, i said, injustice has to be considered.

clearly.

must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three
principles--a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part
of the soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which
is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the
natural vassal,--what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice,
and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every form of vice?

exactly so.

and if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning of
acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly, will also
be perfectly clear?

what do you mean? he said.

why, i said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just
what disease and health are in the body.

how so? he said.

why, i said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is
unhealthy causes disease.

yes.

and just actions cause justice, and unjust actions

er in the parts of the body; and the creation
of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this
natural order?

true.

and is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order
and government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the
creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance
with the natural order?

exactly so, he said.

then virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and
vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?

true.

and do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?

assuredly.

still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and
injustice has not been answered: which is the more profitable, to be
just and act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of
gods and men, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and
unreformed?

in my judgment, socrates, the question has now become ridiculous. we
know that, when the bodily constitut

still worth having to a man, if only he be allowed to do whatever he
likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and
virtue, or to escape from injustice and vice; assuming them both to be
such as we have described?

yes, i said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous. still, as we are
near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with
our own eyes, let us not faint by the way.

certainly not, he replied.

come up hither, i said, and behold the various forms of vice, those of
them, i mean, which are worth looking at.

i am following you, he replied: proceed.

i said, the argument seems to have reached a height from which, as from
some tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue
is one, but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four
special ones which are deserving of note.

what do you mean? he said.

i mean, i replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as
there are distinct forms of the state.

how 
 
 ___________________________
 
many?

there are five of the state, and five of the soul, i said.

what are they?

the first, i said, is that which we have been describing, and which may
be said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as rule
is exercised by one distinguished man or by many.

true, he replied.

but i regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether the
government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been
trained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of
the state will be maintained.

that is true, he replied.

i was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared
to me to succeed one another, when polemarchus, who was sitting a little
way off, just beyond adeimantus, began to whisper to him: stretching
forth his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the
shoulder, and drew him towards him, leaning forward himself so as to be
quite close and saying something in his ear, of which i only caught the
words, 'shall we let him off, or what shall we do?'

certainly not, said adeimantus, raising his voice.

opinion, of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and
use of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally
started, when we said that the men were to be the guardians and
watchdogs of the herd.

true.

let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be
subject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see
whether the result accords with our design.

what do you mean?

what i mean may be put into the form of a question, i said: are dogs
divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and
in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust to
the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave
the females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their
puppies is labour enough for them?

no, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is that
the males are stronger and the females weaker.

certainly, if i am not mistaken, such an admission was made by us. 'and
do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?' and we
shall reply: of course they do. then we shall be asked, 'whether the
tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different, and such as
are agreeable to their different natures?' certainly they should. 'but
if so, have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that
men and women, whose natures are so entirely different, ought to perform
the same actions?'--what defence will you make for us, my good sir,
against any one who offers these objections?

that is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and i shall
and i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.

these are the objections, glaucon, and there are many others of a like
kind, which i foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant to
take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and
children.

true.

and the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices are
to be held by women as well as by men--

yes--

the proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the
pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who
dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of
the better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some
mysterious, unknown place, as they should be.

yes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be
kept pure.

they will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to the
fold when they are full of milk, taking the greatest possible care that
no mother recognises her own child; and other wet-nurses may be engaged
if more are required. care will also be taken that the process of
suckling shall not be protracted too long; and the mothers w

good and useful parents, whereas his child will be the offspring of
darkness and strange lust.

very true, he replied.

and the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed
age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without
the sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up a
bastard to the state, uncertified and unconsecrated.

very true, he replied.

this applies, however, only to those who are within the specified age:
after that we allow them to range at will, except that a man may not
marry his daughter or his daughter's daughter, or his mother or his
mother's mother; and women, on the other hand, are prohibited from

such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of
the terms 'mine' and 'not mine,' 'his' and 'not his.'

exactly so.

and is not that the best-ordered state in which the greatest number of
persons apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to the
same thing?

quite true.

or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the
individual--as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt, the
whole frame, drawn towards the soul as a centre and forming one kingdom
under the ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all
together with the part affected, and we say that the man has a pain in
his finger; and the same expression is used about any other part of the
body, which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the
alleviation of suffering.

very true, he replied; and i agree with you that in the best-ordered
state there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you
describe.

then when any one of the ci

whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these
fundamental principles.

true.

all of whom will call one another citizens?

of course.

but is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other
states?

generally they call them masters, but in democratic states they simply
call them rulers.

and in our state what other name besides that of citizens do the people
give the rulers?

they are called saviours and helpers, he replied.

he would be none the worse.

well, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect state?

to be sure.

and is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the
possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?

surely not, he replied.

that is the truth, i said. but if, at your request, i am to try and show
how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, i must ask
you, having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.

what admissions?

i want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language?
does not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual,
whatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of
the truth? what do you say?

i agree.

then you must not insist on my proving that the actual state will in
every respect coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover
how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that we
hav

i am sure that i should be contented--will not you?

yes, i will.

let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in states which is the
cause of their present maladministration, and what is the least change
which will enable a state to pass into the truer form; and let the
change, if possible, be of one thing only, or, if not, of two; at any
rate, let the changes be as few and slight as possible.

certainly, he replied.

i think, i said, that there might be a reform of the state if only one
change were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible
one.

what is it? he said.

they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything like

arts, are philosophers?

certainly not, i replied; they are only an imitation.

and this is the distinction which i draw between the sight-loving,

alone worthy of the name of philosophers.

how do you distinguish them? he said.

the lovers of sounds and sights, i replied, are, as i conceive, fond of

are made out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving

and will you be so very good as to answer one more question? would you
say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?

certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.

and is opinion also a faculty?

certainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form
an opinion.

and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not
the same as opinion?

why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that which
is infallible with that which errs?

an excellent answer, proving, i said, that we are quite conscious of a
distinction between them.

yes.

then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct
spheres or subject-matters?

that is certain.

in him lies, desire all truth?

assuredly.

but then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong
in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a
stream which has been drawn off into another channel.

true.

he whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be
absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily
pleasure--i mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.

that is most certain.

such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for the
motives which make another man desirous of having and spending, have no
place in his character.

very true.

another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered.

what is that?

to these only you will entrust the state.

here adeimantus interposed and said: to these statements, socrates, no
one can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange feeling
passes over the minds of your hearers: they fancy that they are led
astray a little at each step in the argument, owing to their own want of
skill in asking and answering questions; these littles accumulate, and
at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty
overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned upside down.
and as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up by their
more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move, so they too find
themselves shut up at last; for they have nothing to say in this new
game of which words are the counters; and yet all the time they are in
the right. the observation is suggested to me by what is now occurring.
for any one of us might say, that although in words he is not able

sation? and
nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this.

it is most unbecoming.

for he, adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely no
time to look down upon the affairs of earth, or to be filled with malice
and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed towards
things fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor injured
by one another, but all in order moving according to reason; these he
imitates, and to these he will, as far as he can, conform himself. can a
man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse?

impossible.

and the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, becomes
orderly and divine, as far as the nature of man allows; but like every
one else, he will suffer from detraction.

of course.

but human nature generally, whether in states or individuals, into

at absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the human
copy; and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the
image of a man; and this they will conceive according to that other
image, which, when existing among men, homer calls the form and likeness
of god.

very true, he said.

and one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, until
they have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the
ways of god?

indeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.

and now, i said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you described
as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions
is such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant
because to his hands we comm

made.

very good.

would you not admit that both the sections of this division have
different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the
sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?

most undoubtedly.

next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the
intellectual is to be divided.

in what manner?

thus:--there are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses
the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only
be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends
to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of
hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making
no use of images as in the former case, but proceeding only in and
through the ideas themselves.

i do not quite understand your meaning, he said.

then i will try again; you will understand me better when i have made
some preliminary remarks. yo

iences assume the odd and the even and the
figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches
of science; these are their hypotheses, which they and every body are
supposed to know, and therefore they do not deign to give any account of
them either to themselves or others; but they begin with them, and go
on until they arrive at last, and in a consistent manner, at their
conclusion?

yes, he said, i know.

and do you not know also that although they make use of the visible
forms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the
ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw, but
of the absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on--the forms
which they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water
of their own, are converted by them into images, but they are really
seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the
eye of the mind?

that is true.

and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible,

?

no question, he replied.

to them, i said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of
the images.

that is certain.

and now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners
are released and disabused of their error. at first, when any of them is
liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and
walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare
will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which
in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one
saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now,
when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards
more real existence, he has a clearer vision,--what will be his reply?
and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the
objects as they pass and requiring him to name them,--will he not be
perplexed? will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are
truer than the object

to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision
of their souls upon the things that are below--if, i say, they had been
released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction,
the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as
they see what their eyes are turned to now.

very likely.

yes, i said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather a
necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated
and uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of
their education, will be able ministers of state; not the former,
because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their
actions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will
not act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already
dwelling apart in the islands of the blest.

very true, he replied.

then, i said, the business of us who are the founders of the state
will be to compel the best mind

rue philosophy?

quite so.

and should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of
effecting such a change?

certainly.

what sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming
to being? and another consideration has just occurred to me: you will
remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?

yes, that was said.

then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?

what quality?

usefulness in war.

yes, if possible.

there were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?

just so.

there was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the
body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and
corruption?

true.

then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?

no.

but what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent
into our former scheme?

music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,
and trained the guardians by the influences of habit

 geometry, we should employ problems,
and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right
way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use.

that, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.

yes, i said; and there are many other things which must also have a
similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any
value. but can you tell me of any other suitable study?

no, he said, not without thinking.

motion, i said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are
obvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others,
as i imagine, which may be left to wiser persons.

but where are the two?

there is a second, i said, which is the counterpart of the one already
named.

and what may that be?

the second, i said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the
first is to the eyes; for i conceive that as the eyes are designed to
look up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and
these

t perhaps, in thus turning jest into
earnest i am equally ridiculous.

in what respect?

i had forgotten, i said, that we were not serious, and spoke with too
much excitement. for when i saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled
under foot of men i could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the
authors of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.

indeed! i was listening, and did not think so.

but i, who am the speaker, felt that i was. and now let me remind you
that, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must not do
so in this. solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he
grows old may learn many things--for he can no more learn much than he
can run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.

of course.

and, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of
instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented
to the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our
system of education.

ranch of knowledge come at
last to their consummation: the time has now arrived at which they must
raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all
things, and behold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according
to which they are to order the state and the lives of individuals, and
the remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief
pursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics and ruling
for the public good, not as though they were performing some heroic
action, but simply as a matter of duty; and when they have brought up in
each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to
be governors of the state, then they will depart to the islands of the
blest and dwell there; and the city will give them public memorials and
sacrifices and honour them, if the pythian oracle consent, as demigods,
but if not, as in any case blessed and divine.

state.

true, i said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, let
us find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the old
path.

there is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that you
had finished the description of the state: you said that such a state
was good, and that the man was good who answered to it, although, as now
appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of state and man.
and you said further, that if this was the true form, then the others
were false; and of the false forms, you said, as i remember, that there
were four principal ones, and that their defects, and the defects of
the individuals corresponding to them, were worth examining. when we had
seen all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was the best and
who was the worst of them, we were to consider whether the best was not
also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable. i asked you
what were the four forms of government of which you spoke, 
 
 ___________________________
 
nd let me ask the same questions, and do you give me the
same answer which you were about to give me then.

yes, if i can, i will, i said.

i shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of
which you were speaking.

that question, i said, is easily answered: the four governments of which
i spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of crete
and sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed oligarchy
comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of government
which teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally follows
oligarchy, although very different: and lastly comes tyranny, great
and famous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and worst
disorder of a state. i do not know, do you? of any other constitution
which can be said to have a distinct character. there are lordships and
principalities which are bought and sold, and some other intermediate
forms of government. but these are nondescripts and may be found equ

among hellenes and among barbarians.

yes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government
which exist among them.

do you know, i said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men
vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the
other? for we cannot suppose that states are made of 'oak and rock,' and
not out of the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure
turn the scale and draw other things after them?

yes, he said, the states are as the men are; they grow out of human
characters.

then if the constitutions of states are five, t

ses say next?

when discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the
iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and
silver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the
true riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the ancient
order of things. there was a battle between them, and at last they
agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual owners;
and they enslaved their friends and maintainers, whom they had formerly
protected in the condition of freemen, and made of them subjects and
servants; and they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch
against them.

i believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change.

and the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate
between oligarchy and aristocracy?

very true.

such will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will
they proceed? clearly, the new state, being in a mean between oligarchy
and the
 
 ___________________________
 
 perfect state, will partly follow one and partly the other, and
will also have some peculiarities.

true, he said.

in the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class
from agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution
of common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military
training--in all these respects this state will resemble the former.

true.

but in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they are no
longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements;
and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters, who
are by nature fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value set
by them upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in the waging of
everlasting wars--this state will be for the most part peculiar.

yes.

yes, i said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of mone
 
 ___________________________
 
, he said.

and they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the
money which they prize; they will spend that which is another man's on
the gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures and running
away like children from the law, their father: they have been schooled
not by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected her
who is the true muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and have
honoured gymnastic more than music.

undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a
mixture of good and evil.

why, there is a mixture, i said; but one thing, and one thing only, is
predominantly seen,--the spirit of contention and ambition; and these
are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.

assuredly, he said.

such is the origin and such the character of this state, which has been
described in outline only; the more perfect execution was not required,
for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly 
 
 ___________________________
 
just and
most perfectly unjust; and to go through all the states and all the
characters of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable
labour.

very true, he replied.

now what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into
being, and what is he like?

i think, said adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which
characterises him, he is not unlike our friend glaucon.

perhaps, i said, he may be like him in that one point; but there are
other respects in which he is very different.

in what respects?

he should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet
a friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker.
such a person is apt to be rough with
 
 ___________________________
 
 slaves, unlike the educated man,
who is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen, and
remarkably obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a lover of
honour; claiming to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or on any
ground of that sort, but because he is a soldier and has performed feats
of arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase.

yes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.

such an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he gets
older he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a
piece of the avaricious nature in him, and is not single-minded towards
virtue, having lost his best guardian.

who was that? said adeimantus.

philosophy, i said, tempered with music, who comes and takes up her
abode in

is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul, the
others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive; and he being not
originally of a bad nature, but having kept bad company, is at last
brought by their joint influence to a middle point, and gives up the
kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness
and passion, and becomes arrogant and ambitious.

you seem to me to have described his origin perfectly.

then we have now, i said, the second form of government and the second
type of character?

we have.

next, let us look at another man who, as aeschylus says,

'is set over against another state;'

or rather, as our plan requires, begin with the state.

by all means.

i believe that oligarchy follows next in order.

and what manner of government do you term oligarchy?

a government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich have
power and the poor man is deprived of it.

i understand, he replied.

ought i not to begin by desc
 
 ___________________________
 
oney as the
qualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower
in another, as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow
no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in
the government. these changes in the constitution they effect by force
of arms, if intimidation has not already done their work.

very true.

and this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is
established.

yes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of
government, and what are the defects of which we were speaking?

first of all, i said, consider the nature of the qualification. just
think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their
property, and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though
he were a better pilot?

you mean that they would shipwreck?

yes; and is not this true of the government of anything?

i should imagine so.

except a city?--or would you include a city?

nay, he said, the case of a city
 
 ___________________________
 

clearly.

well, i said, and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers?

yes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.

and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to
be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities are
careful to restrain by force?

certainly, we may be so bold.

the existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education,
ill-training, and an evil constitution of the state?

true.

such, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there
may be many other evils.

very likely.

then oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are
elected for their wealth, may now be dismissed. let us next proceed to
consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this
state.

by all means.

does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?

how?

a time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first
he begins by emulating his fath

er and walking in his footsteps, but
presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the state as upon
a sunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been
a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a
prejudice raised by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or
deprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken from
him.

nothing more likely.

and the son has seen and known all this--he is a ruined man, and his
fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his
bosom's throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by mean
and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. is not such
an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the

e illness, of which
the occasion may be very slight, the one party introducing from without
their oligarchical, the other their democratical allies, and then
the state falls sick, and is at war with herself; and may be at times
distracted, even when there is no external cause.

yes, surely.

and then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their
opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder
they give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of
government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot.

yes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution
has been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite party
to withdraw.

and now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government have
they? for as the government is, such will be the man.

clearly, he said.

in the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of
freedom and frankness--a man may say and do what he likes?

e of some rarely gifted nature,
there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used
to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study--how
grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet,
never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and
promoting to honour any one who professes to be the people's friend.

yes, she is of a noble spirit.

these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which
is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and
dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.

we know her well.

consider now, i said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather
consider, as in the case of the state, how he comes into being.

very good, he said.

is not this the way--he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical
father who has trained him in his own habits?

exactly.

and, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of
the spending and 
 
 ___________________________
 
said, i know it too well.

such, my friend, i said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of which
springs tyranny.

glorious indeed, he said. but what is the next step?

the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease
magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy--the truth
being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in
the opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and
in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.

true.

the excess of liberty, whether in states or individuals, seems only to
pass into excess of slavery.

yes, the natural order.

and so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most
aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of
liberty?

as we might expect.

that, however, was not, as i believe, your question--you rather desired
to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and
democracy, and is the ruin of both?

jus
 
 ___________________________
 
t for themselves?

why, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share.

and the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to
defend themselves before the people as they best can?

what else can they do?

and then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge
them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?

true.

and the end is that when they see the people, not of their own accord,
but through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers,
seeking to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become
oligarchs in reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the
drones torments them and breeds revolution in them.

that is exactly the truth.

then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another.

true.

the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse
into greatness.

yes, that is their way.

this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first
appears above ground he

beat his father if he opposes him?

yes, he will, having first disarmed him.

then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and this
is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as the
saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of
freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves. thus
liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest
and bitterest form of slavery.

true, he said.

very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently
discussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from
democracy to tyranny?

yes, quite enough, he said.




book ix.

last of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more to
ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in
happiness or in misery?

yes, he said, he is the only one remaining.

there is, however, i said, a previous question which remai

 him.

yes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.

and when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and
garlands and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let
loose, come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of
desire which they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this
lord of the soul, having madness for the captain of his guard, breaks
out into a frenzy: and if he finds in himself any good opinions or
appetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense of
shame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, and casts
them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to
the full.

yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.

and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?

i should not wonder.

further, i said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?

he has.

and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mi
 
 ___________________________
 
ful, passionate? o my friend, is not that so?

assuredly.

such is the man and such is his origin. and next, how does he live?

suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.

i imagine, i said, at the next step in his progress, that there will be
feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort
of thing; love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the
concerns of his soul.

that is certain.

yes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,
and their demands are many.

they are indeed, he said.

his revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.

true.

then comes debt and the cutting down of his property.

of course.

when he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest
like young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by them,
and especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them,
is in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil
of his property, in order that h
 
 ___________________________
 
these in his democratic days, when he was
still subject to the laws and to his father, were only let loose in
the dreams of sleep. but now that he is under the dominion of love, he
becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in
a dream only; he will commit the foulest murder, or eat forbidden food,
or be guilty of any other horrid act. love is his tyrant, and lives
lordly in him and lawlessly, and being himself a king, leads him on, as
a tyrant leads a state, to the performance of any reckless deed by which
he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates, whether those
whom evil communications have brought in from without, or those whom
he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar
evil nature in himself. have we not here a picture of his way of life?

yes, indeed, he said.

and if there are only a few of them in the state, and the rest of the
people are well disposed, they go away and become the body-guard or
mercenary soldiers

of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a
war; and if there is no war, they stay at home and do many little pieces
of mischief in the city.

what sort of mischief?

for example, they are the thieves, burglars, cut-purses, foot-pads,
robbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able
to speak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take bribes.

a small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are few in
number.

yes, i said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all these
things, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state, do not
come within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class and
their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength,
assisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among
themselves the one who

 which, and therefore
i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision
about their relative happiness and misery. and here we must not allow
ourselves to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is
only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us
go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about, and
then we will give our opinion.

a fair invitation, he replied; and i see, as every one must, that a
tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king
the happiest.

and in estimating the men too, may i not fairly make a like request,
that i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through
human nature? he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and
is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to
the beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. may i suppose
that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able
to judge, and has dwel

from what has been said, i gather that you are right.

yes, i replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more
certain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this
respecting good and evil is the greatest.

very true, he said.

let me then offer you an illustration, which may, i think, throw a light
upon this subject.

what is your illustration?

the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from
them you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have
slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.

yes, that is the difference.

you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from
their servants?

what should they fear?

nothing. but do you observe the reason of this?

yes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the
protection of each individual.

very true, i said. but imagine one of these owners, the master say of
some fifty slaves, together wi

 that?

the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that
the individual soul, like the state, has been divided by us into three
principles, the division may, i think, furnish a new demonstration.

of what nature?

it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures
correspond; also three desires and governing powers.

how do you mean? he said.

there is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,
another with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has no
special name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from
the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and
drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of
it; also money-loving, because such desires are generally satisfied by
the help of money.

that is true, he said.

if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were
concerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single
notion; and might truly and

nd quality of justice and
injustice, let us have a little conversation with him.

what shall we say to him?

let us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words
presented before his eyes.

of what sort?

an ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient
mythology, such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus, and there are many
others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one.

there are said of have been such unions.

then do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster,
having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he
is able to generate and metamorphose at will.

you suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is more
pliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model as
you propose.

suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third of a
man, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than the
second.

that, he said, is an easier task

yes, said glaucon, far worse--i will answer for him.

has not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge
multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large?

clearly.

and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent
element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?

yes.

and luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this
same creature, and make a coward of him?

very true.

ur question.

can you tell me what imitation is? for i really do not know.

a likely thing, then, that i should know.

why not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the
keener.

very true, he said; but in your presence, even if i had any faint
notion, i could not muster courage to utter it. will you enquire
yourself?

well then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: whenever a
number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a
corresponding idea or form:--do you understand me?

i do.

let us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the
world--plenty of them, are there not?

yes.

but there are only two ideas or forms of them--one the idea of a bed,
the other of a table.

true.

and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our
use, in accordance with the idea--that is our way of speaking in this
and similar instances--but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how
could he?

impossible.

and there is anoth

 the imitator, i said, is a long way off the truth, and can do all
things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that part
an image. for example: a painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter, or
any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if he is
a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows
them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy
that they are looking at a real carpenter.

certainly.

and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all
the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing
with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man--whoever tells us
this, i think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who
is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and
whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyse
the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.

most true.

and so, when we hear persons sayin

blooming; and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?

exactly.

here is another point: the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing
of true existence; he knows appearances only. am i not right?

yes.

then let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half
an explanation.

proceed.

of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?

yes.

and the worker in leather and brass will make them?

certainly.

but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? nay,
hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the
horseman who knows how to use them--he knows their right form.

most true.

and may we not say the same of all things?

what?

that there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one which
uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?

yes.

and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate or
inanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which

nature or the artist has intended them.

true.

then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and
he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop
themselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the
flute-maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he
will tell him how he ought to make them, and the other will attend to
his instructions?

of course.

the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and
badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is
told by him?

true.

the instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it
the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain
from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what
he has to say,

ion that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only
poetry which ought to be admitted into our state. for if you go beyond
this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or lyric verse,
not law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent have ever
been deemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state.

that is most true, he said.

and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this our
defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in
sending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we have
described; for reason constrained us. but that she may not impute to us
any harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there is an
ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry; of which there are many
proofs, such as the saying of 'the yelping hound howling at her lord,'
or of one 'mighty in the vain talk of fools,' and 'the mob of sages
circumventing zeus,' and the 'subtle thinkers who are beggar

more clearly. thus
far, we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present,
but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition
which may be compared to that of the sea-god glaucus, whose original
image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken
off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways, and
incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones, so
that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form.
and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition, disfigured by
ten thousand ills. but not there, glaucon, not there must we look.

where then?

at her love of wisdom. let us see whom she affects, and what society and
converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal
and eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly
following this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out of
the ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and

 shells
and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her
because she feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good things of
this life as they are termed: then you would see her as she is, and know
whether she have one shape only or many, or what her nature is. of her
affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think
that we have now said enough.

true, he replied.

and thus, i said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument; we
have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which, as you
were saying, are to be found in homer and hesiod; but justice in her own
nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature. let a
man do what is just, whether he have the ring of gyges or not, and even
if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on

the demand, he said, is just.

in the first place, i said--and this is the first thing which you will
have to give back--the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known
to the gods.

granted.

and if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the other
the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?

true.

and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all
things at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary
consequence of former sins?

certainly.

then this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in
poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will
in the end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods
have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like
god, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of
virtue?

yes, he said; if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him.

ay's journey brought them to
the place, and there, in the midst of the light, they saw the ends of
the chains of heaven let down from above: for this light is the belt
of heaven, and holds together the circle of the universe, like the
under-girders of a trireme. from these ends is extended the spindle of
necessity, on which all the revolutions turn. the shaft and hook of this
spindle are made of steel, and the whorl is made partly of steel and
also partly of other materials. now the whorl is in form like the whorl
used on earth; and the description of it implied that there is one large
hollow whorl which is quite scooped out, and into this is fitted another
lesser one, and another, and another, and four others, making eight
in all, like vessels which fit into one another; the whorls show their
edges on the upper side, and on their lower side all together form one
continuous whorl. this is pierced by the spindle, which is driven home
through the centre of the eighth. the first and outermost

the fourth; the third appeared fourth and the second fifth. the spindle
turns on the knees of necessity; and on the upper surface of each circle
is a siren, who goes round with them, hymning a single tone or note. the
eight together form one harmony; and round about, at equal intervals,
there is another band, three in number, each sitting upon her throne:
these are the fates, daughters of necessity, who are clothed in white
robes and have chaplets upon their heads, lachesis and clotho

the future; clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right

ot perceived the number which he had obtained. then the
interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives; and
there were many more lives than the souls present, and they were of all
sorts. there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition.
and there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the tyrant's life,
others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and
exile and beggary; and there were lives of famous men, some who were
famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and
success in games, or, again, for their birth and the qualities of their
ancestors; and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite
qualities. and of women likewise; there was not, however, any definite
character in them, because the soul, when choosing a new life, must of
necessity become different. but there was every other quality, and
the all mingled with one another, and also with elements of wealth and
poverty, and disease and health; a

thought out the whole matter before he chose, and did not at first
sight perceive that he was fated, among other evils, to devour his own
children. but when he had time to reflect, and saw what was in the lot,
he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice, forgetting the
proclamation of the prophet; for, instead of throwing the blame of his
misfortune on himself, he accused chance and the gods, and everything
rather than himself. now he was one of those who came from heaven, and
in a former life had dwelt in a well-ordered state, but his virtue was
a matter of habit only, and he had no philosophy. and it was true of
others who were similarly overtaken, that the greater number of them
came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial,
whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and
seen others suffer, were not in a hurry to choose. and owing to this
inexperience of theirs, and also because the lot was a chance, many of

arms. the next was agamemnon, who took the life of an eagle, because,
like ajax, he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings. about
the middle came the lot of atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of
an athlete, was unable to resist the temptation: and after her there
followed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature
of a woman cunning in the arts; and far away among the last who chose,
the soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey.
there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice, and
his lot happened to be the last of them all. now the recollection of
former toils had disenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for
a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no
cares; he had some difficulty in finding this, which was lying about and
had been neglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that
he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of la
