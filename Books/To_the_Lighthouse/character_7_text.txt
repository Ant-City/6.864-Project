at the line, at the colour, at mrs. ramsay sitting in the window with
james, she kept a feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep
up, and suddenly she should find her picture looked at. but now, with all
her senses quickened as they were, looking, straining, till the colour of
the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes, she was aware of
someone coming out of the house, coming towards her; but somehow divined,
from the footfall, william bankes, so that though her brush quivered, she
did not, as she would have done had it been mr. tansley, paul rayley,
minta doyle, or practically anybody else, turn her canvas upon the grass,
but let it stand. william bankes stood beside her.

they had rooms in the village, and so, walking in, walking out, parting
late on door-mats, had said little things about the soup, about the
children, about one thing and another which made them allies; so that when
he stood beside her now in his judicial way (he

inadequacy, her insignificance, keeping house for
her father off the brompton road, and had much ado to control her impulse
to fling herself (thank heaven she had always resisted so far) at
mrs. ramsay's knee and say to her--but what could one say to her? "i'm in
love with you?" no, that was not true. "i'm in love with this all,"
waving her hand at the hedge, at the house, at the children. it was
absurd, it was impossible. so now she laid her brushes neatly in the box,
side by side, and said to william bankes:

"it suddenly gets cold. the sun seems to give less heat," she said,
looking about her, for it was bright enough, the grass still a soft deep
green, the house starred in its greenery with purple passion flowers, and
rooks dropping cool cries from the high blue. but something moved,
flashed, turned a silver wing in the air. it was september after all,
the middle of september, and past six in the evening. so off they

let its sails drop down; and then, with a natural instinct to complete the
picture, after this swift movement, both of them looked at the dunes
far away, and instead of merriment felt come over them some
sadness--because the thing was completed partly, and partly because
distant views seem to outlast by a million years (lily thought) the gazer
and to be communing already with a sky which beholds an earth entirely
at rest.

looking at the far sand hills, william bankes thought of ramsay: thought
of a road in westmorland, thought of ramsay striding along a road by
himself hung round with that solitude which seemed to be his natural air.
but this was suddenly interrupted, william bankes remembered (and this
must refer to some actual incident), by a hen, straddling her wings out in
protection of a covey of little chicks, upon which ramsay, stopping,
pointed his stick and said "pretty--pretty," an odd illumination in to
his heart, bankes had thought it, which sho

and lily briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments (for she was in
love with them all, in love with this world) he weighed ramsay's case,
commiserated him, envied him, as if he had seen him divest himself of all
those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to
cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking
domesticities. they gave him something--william bankes acknowledged that;
it would have been pleasant if cam had stuck a flower in his coat or
clambered over his shoulder, as over her father's, to look at a picture
of vesuvius in eruption; but they had also, his old friends could not but
feel, destroyed something. what would a stranger think now? what did
this lily briscoe think? could one help noticing that habits grew on him?
eccentricities, weaknesses perhaps? it was astonishing that a man of his
intellect could stoop so low as he did--but that

something of this delicious emotion, this impure rhapsody of which he was
ashamed, but in which he revelled--he turned abruptly, slammed his private
door on them; and, lily briscoe and mr. bankes, looking uneasily up into
the sky, observed that the flock of starlings which jasper had routed with
his gun had settled on the tops of the elm trees.

"and even if it isn't fine tomorrow," said mrs. ramsay, raising her eyes
to glance at william bankes and lily briscoe as they passed, "it will be
another day. and now," she said, thinking that lily's charm was her
chinese eyes, aslant in her white, puckered little face, but it would take
a clever man to see it, "and now stand up, and let me measure your leg,"
for they might go to the lighthouse after all, and she must see if the
stocking did not need to be an inch or two longer in the leg.

of his person, as if he wrapped himself about and needed privacy into
which to regain his equilibrium, that he was outraged and anguished. she
stroked james's head; she transferred to him what she felt for her
husband, and, as she watched him chalk yellow the white dress shirt of a
gentleman in the army and navy stores catalogue, t

hey must know that of the two he was
infinitely the more important, and what she gave the world, in comparison
with what he gave, negligable. but then again, it was the other thing
too--not being able to tell him the truth, being afraid, for instance,
about the greenhouse roof and the expense it would be, fifty pounds
perhaps to mend it; and then about his books, to be afraid that he might
guess, what she a little suspected, that his last book was not quite his
best book (she gathered that from william bankes); and then to hide small
daily things, and the children seeing it, and the burden it laid on
them--all this diminished the entire joy, the pure joy, of the two notes
sounding together, and let the sound die on her ear now with a dismal
flatness.

human ignorance, how we know nothing and the sea eats away the ground we

dismounted, all gestures and fripperies, all trophies of nuts and roses,
and shrunk so that not only fame but even his own name was forgotten

he inspired in william bankes (intermittently) and in charles tansley

gratitude for the duty it is taking upon itself of marking the channel out
there in the floods alone.

made, in the ardour of youth, in his wife's beauty, in the tributes that
reached him from swansea, cardiff, exeter, southampton, kidderminster,
oxford, cambridge--all had to be deprecated and concealed under the phrase
"talking nonsense," because, in effect, he had not done the thing he might
have done. it was a disguise; it was the refuge of a man afraid to own
his own feelings, who could not say, this is what i like--this is what i
am; and rather pitiable and distasteful to william bankes and lily briscoe,
who wondered why such concealments should be necessary; why he needed
always praise; why so brave a man in thought should be so timid in life;
how strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time.

putting away her things.) if you are exalted you must somehow come a

lodgings except for tonight; and in pity for him, life being now strong
enough to bear her on again, she began all this business, as a sailor
not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants
to be off again and thinks how, had the ship sunk, he would have
whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of the sea.

"did you find your letters? i told them to put them in the hall for
you," she said to william bankes.

lily briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no-man's land where
to follow people is impossible and yet their going inflicts such a
chill on those who watch them that they always try at least to follow
them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have
sunk beneath the horizon.

how old she looks, how worn she looks, lily thought, and how remote.
then when she turned to william bankes, smiling, it was as if the ship
had turned and the sun had struck its sails again,

with some amusement because she was relieved, why does she pity him?
for that was the impression she gave, when she told him that his
letters were in the hall. poor william bankes, she seemed to be

life in her, her resolve to live again, had been stirred by pity. and
it was not true, lily thought; it was one of those misjudgments of hers
that seemed to be instinctive and to arise from some need of her own
rather than of other people's. he is not in the least pitiable. he has

miss briscoe properly; he wished it had not come out all in a jerk like
that. "you'd be sick." he wished he could think of something to say to
mrs. ramsay, something which would show her that he was not just a dry
prig. that was what they all thought him. he turned to her. but mrs.
ramsay was talking about people he had never heard of to william
bankes.

"yes, take it away," she said briefly, interrupting what she was saying
to william bankes to speak to the maid. "it must have been fifteen--
no, twenty years ago--that i last saw her," she was saying, turning
back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of their talk, for
she was absorbed by what they were saying. so he had actually heard
from her this evening! and was carrie still living at marlow, and was
everything still the same? oh, she could remember it as if it were

satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the mannings
and the ramsays. he had not drifted apart he thought, laying down his
spoon and wiping his clean-shaven lips punctiliously. but perhaps he
was rather unusual, he thought, in this; he never let himself get into
a groove. he had friends in all circles... mrs. ramsay had to break
off here to tell the maid something about keeping food hot. that was
why he preferred dining alone. all those interruptions annoyed him.
well, thought william bankes, preserving a demeanour of exquisite
courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the
table-cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and
ready for use in an interval of leisure, such are the sacrifices one's
friends ask of one. it would have hurt her if he had refused to come.
but it was not worth it for him. looking at his hand he thought that
if he had been alone dinner would have been almost over now; he would
have been free to work. yes, he thought, it is a

ly to fill up space, thinking what an
old maid william was becoming. conscious of his treachery, conscious
of her wish to talk about something more intimate, yet out of mood for
it at present, he felt come over him the disagreeableness of life,
sitting there, waiting. perhaps the others were saying something
interesting? what were they saying?

that the fishing season was bad; that the men were emigrating. they
were talking about wages and unemployment. the young man was abusing
the government. william bankes, thinking what a relief it was to catch
on to something of this sort when private life was disagreeable, heard
him say something about "one of the most scandalous acts of the present
government." lily was listening; mrs. ramsay was listening; they were
all listening. but already bored, lily felt that something was lacking;
mr. bankes felt that something was lacking. pulling her shawl round her

said "we." "we did this, we did that." they'll say that all their
lives, she thought, and an exquisite scent of olives and oil and juice
rose from the great brown dish as marthe, with a little flourish, took
the cover off. the cook had spent three days over that dish. and she
must take great care, mrs. ramsay thought, diving into the soft mass, to
choose a specially tender piece for william bankes. and she peered into
the dish, with its shiny walls and its confusion of savoury brown and
yellow meats and its bay leaves and its wine, and thought, this will
celebrate the occasion--a curious sense rising in her, at once freakish
and tender, of celebrating a festival, as if two emotions were called
up in her, one profound--for what could be more serious than the love
of man for woman, what more commanding, more impressive, bearing in its
bosom the seeds of death; at the same time these lovers

t her was so small. yet, thought mrs.
ramsay, comparing her with minta, as she claimed her help (for lily
should bear her out she talked no more about her dairies than her
husband did about his boots--he would talk by the hour about his boots)
of the two, lily at forty will be the better. there was in lily a
thread of something; a flare of something; something of her own which
mrs. ramsay liked very much indeed, but no man would, she feared.
obviously, not, unless it were a much older man, like william bankes.
but then he cared, well, mrs. ramsay sometimes thought that he cared,
since his wife's death, perhaps for her. he was not "in love" of
course; it was one of those unclassified affections of which there are
so many. oh, but nonsense, she thought; william must marry lily. they
have so many things in common. lily is so fond of flowers. they are
both cold and aloof and rather self-sufficing. she must arrange for
them to take a long walk together.

foolishly, she had set them opposite each other. t

g seemed right. just now (but this cannot
last, she thought, dissociating herself from the moment while they were
all talking about boots) just now she had reached security; she hovered
like a hawk suspended; like a flag floated in an element of joy which
filled every nerve of her body fully and sweetly, not noisily, solemnly
rather, for it arose, she thought, looking at them all eating there,
from husband and children and friends; all of which rising in this
profound stillness (she was helping william bankes to one very small
piece more, and peered into the depths of the earthenware pot) seemed
now for no special reason to stay there like a smoke, like a fume
rising upwards, holding them safe together. nothing need be said;
nothing could be said. there it was, all round them. it partook, she
felt, carefully helping mr. bankes to a specially tender piece, of
eternity; as she had already felt about something different once before
that afternoon; there is a coherence in things, a stability; something,

she meant, is immune from change, and shines out (she glanced at the
window with its ripple of reflected lights) in the face of the flowing,
the fleeting, the spectral, like a ruby; so that again tonight she had
the feeling she had had once today, already, of peace, of rest. of
such moments, she thought, the thing is made that endures.

"yes," she assured william bankes, "there is plenty for everybody."

"andrew," she said, "hold your plate lower, or i shall spill it." (the
boeuf en daube was a perfect triumph.) here, she felt, putting the
spoon down, where one could move or rest; could wait now (they were all
helped) listening; could then, like a hawk which lapses suddenly from
its high station, flaunt and sink on laughter easily, resting her whole
weight upon what at the other end of the table her husband was saying
about the square root of one thousand two

land tenure; on lord rosebery; on creevey's memoirs: she let it uphold
her and sustain her, this admirable fabric of the masculine
intelligence, which ran up and down, crossed this way and that, like
iron girders spanning the swaying fabric, upholding the world, so that
she could trust herself to it utterly, even shut her eyes, or flicker
them for a moment, as a child staring up from its pillow winks at the
myriad layers of the leaves of a tree. then she woke up. it was still
being fabricated. william bankes was praising the waverly novels.

he read one of them every six months, he said. and why should that make
charles tansley angry? he rushed in (all, thought mrs. ramsay, because
prue will not be nice to him) and denounced the waverly novels when he
knew nothing about it, nothing about it whatsoever, mrs. ramsay thought,
observing him rather than listening to what he said. she could see how
it was from his manner--he wanted to assert himself, and so it would
always be with him till he got his pro

his wife had been fond of her. he had been a little out of temper too
at breakfast. and then, and then--this was one of those moments when
an enormous need urged him, without being conscious what it was, to
approach any woman, to force them, he did not care how, his need was so
great, to give him what he wanted: sympathy.

lily stepped back to get her canvas--so--into perspective. it was an
odd road to be walking, this of painting. out and out one went,
further, until at last one seemed to be on a narrow plank, perfectly
alone, over the sea. and as she dipped into the blue paint, she
dipped too into the past there. now mrs. ramsay got up, she
remembered. it was time to go back to the house--time for
luncheon. and they all walked up from the beach together, she walking
behind with william bankes, and there was minta in front of them with a
hole in her stocking. how that little round hole of pink heel seemed
to flaunt itself before them! how william bankes deplored it, without,
so far as she could remember, saying anything about it! it meant to
him the annihilation of womanhood, and dirt and disorder, and servants
leaving and beds not made at mid-day--all the things he most abhorred.

all gone against your wishes. they're happy like that; i'm happy like
this. life has changed completely. at that all her being, even her
beauty, became for a moment, dusty and out of date. for a moment lily,
standing there, with the sun hot on her back, summing up the rayleys,
triumphed over mrs. ramsay, who would never know how paul went to
coffee-houses and had a mistress; how he sat on the ground and minta
handed him his tools; how she stood here painting, had never married,
not even william bankes.

mrs. ramsay had planned it. perhaps, had she lived, she would have
compelled it. already that summer he was "the kindest of men." he was
"the first scientist of his age, my husband says." he was also "poor
william--it makes me so unhappy, when i go to see him, to find nothing
nice in his house--no one to arrange the flowers." so they were sent
for walks together, and she was told, with that faint touch of irony
that made mrs. ramsay slip through one's fingers, that she had a

she had only escaped by the skin of her teeth though, she thought. she
had been looking at the table-cloth, and it had flashed upon her that
she would move the tree to the middle, and need never marry anybody,
and she had felt an enormous exultation. she had felt, now she could
stand up to mrs. ramsay--a tribute to the astonishing power that mrs.
ramsay had over one. do this, she said, and one did it. even her
shadow at the window with james was full of authority. she remembered
how william bankes had been shocked by her neglect of the significance
of mother and son. did she not admire their beauty? he said. but
william, she remembered, had listened to her with his wise child's eyes
when she explained how it was not irreverence: how a light there needed
a shadow there and so on. she did not intend to disparage a subject
which, they agreed, raphael had treated divinely. she was not cynical.

indeed, his friendship had been one of the pleasures of her life. she
loved william bankes.

they went to hampton court and he always left her, like the perfect
gentleman he was, plenty of time to wash her hands, while he strolled
by the river. that was typical of their relationship. many things were
left unsaid. then they strolled through the courtyards, and admired,
summer after summer, the proportions and the flowers, and he would tell
her things, about perspective, about architecture, as they walked, and
he would stop to look at a tree, or the view over the lake, and admire

under the window where she sat writing letters or talking, for she
would take care to be busy when he passed, and evade him, and pretend
not to see him. then he would turn smooth as silk, affable, urbane,
and try to win her so. still she would hold off, and now she would
assert for a brief season some of those prides and airs the due
of her beauty which she was generally utterly without; would turn
her head; would look so, over her shoulder, always with some
minta, paul, or william bankes at her side. at length, standing
outside the group the very figure of a famished wolfhound (lily got up
off the grass and stood looking at the steps, at the window, where she
had seen him), he would say her name, once only, for all the world like
a wolf barking in the snow, but still she held back; and he would say
it once more, and this time something in the tone would rouse her, and
she would go to him, leaving them all of a sudden, and they would walk
off together among the pear trees, the c
