    let us be lead within thy bosom, richard,
    and weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
    thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die.
    [to richmond]  sleep, richmond, sleep in peace, and
    wake in joy;
    good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
    live, and beget a happy race of kings!
    edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.

          enter the ghost of lady anne, his wife

  ghost.  [to richard]  richard, thy wife, that wretched
    anne thy wife
    that never slept a quiet hour with thee
    now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
    to-morrow in the battle think on me,
    and fall thy edgeless sword. despair and die.
    [to richmond]  thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep;
    dream of success and happy victory.
    thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.

                   enter the ghost of buckingham

  ghost.  [to richard]
