you all.
  first gentleman. who's that, i pray thee?
  mrs. overdone. marry, sir, that's claudio, signior claudio.
  first gentleman. claudio to prison? 'tis not so.
  mrs. overdone. nay, but i know 'tis so: i saw him arrested; saw
him
    carried away; and, which is more, within these three days his
    head to be chopp'd off.
  lucio. but, after all this fooling, i would not have it so. art
    thou sure of this?
  mrs. overdone. i am too sure of it; and it is for getting madam
    julietta with child.
  lucio. believe me, this may be; he promis'd to meet me two
hours
    since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.
  second gentleman. besides, you know, it draws something near to
the
    speech we had to such a purpose.
  first gentleman. but most of all agreeing with the
proclamation.
  lucio. away; let's go learn the truth of it.

you;
    you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
will

  mrs. overdone. what's to do here, thomas tapster? let's
withdraw.
  pompey. here comes signior claudio, led by the provost to
prison;
    and there's madam juliet.                             exeunt

  claudio. fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th' world?
    bear me to prison, where i am committed.
  provost. i do it not in evil disposition,
    but from lord angelo by special charge.
  claudio. thus can the demigod authority
    make us pay down for our offence by weight

    what's thy offence, claudio?
  claudio. what but to speak of would offend again.
  lucio. what, is't murder?
  claudio. no.
  lucio. lechery?
  claudio. call it so.
  provost. away, sir; you must go.
  claudio. one word, good friend. lucio, a word with you.
  lucio. a hundred, if they'll do you any good. is lechery so
look'd
    after?
  claudio. thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
    i got possession of julietta's bed.
    you know the lady; she is fast my wife,
    save that we do the denunciation lack
    of outward order; this we came not to,
    only for propagation of a dow'r
    remaining in the coffer of her friends.
    from whom we thought it meet to hide our love
    till time had made them for us. but it chances
    the stealth of our most mutual entertainment,
    with character too gross, is writ on juliet.

  claudio. unhappily, even so.

ed as a friar, and provost

  duke. hail to you, provost! so i think you are.
  provost. i am the provost. what's your will, good friar?
  duke. bound by my charity and my blest order,
    i come to visit the afflicted spirits
    here in the prison. do me the common right
    to let me see them, and to make me know
    the nature of their crimes, that i may minister
    to them accordingly.
  provost. i would do more than that, if more were needful.

                          enter juliet

    look, here comes one; a gentlewoman of mine,
    who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
    hath blister'd her report. she is with child;
    and he that got it, sentenc'd- a young man
    more fit to do another such offence
    than die for this.
  duke. when must he die?
  provost. as i do think, to-morrow.
    [to juliet] i have provided for you; stay awhile
    and you shall be conducted.
  duke. repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
  juliet. i do; and bear the

 shame most patiently.
  duke. i'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
    and try your penitence, if it be sound
    or hollowly put on.
  juliet. i'll gladly learn.
  duke. love you the man that wrong'd you?
  juliet. yes, as i love the woman that wrong'd him.
  duke. so then, it seems, your most offenceful act
    was mutually committed.
  juliet. mutually.
  duke. then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
  juliet. i do confess it, and repent it, father.
  duke. 'tis meet so, daughter; but lest you do repent
    as that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
    which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,
    showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
    but as we stand in fear-
  juliet. i do repent me as it is an evil,
    and take the shame with joy.
  duke. there rest.
    your partner, as i hear, must die to-morrow,
    and i am going with instruction to him.

xit provost
  escalus. i am sorry one so learned and so wise
    as you, lord angelo, have still appear'd,
    should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood
    and lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
  angelo. i am sorry that such sorrow i procure;
    and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
    that i crave death more willingly than mercy;
    'tis my deserving, and i do entreat it.

  provost. this, my lord.
  duke. there was a friar told me of this man.
    sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul,
    that apprehends no further than this world,
    and squar'st thy life according. thou'rt condemn'd;
    but, for those earthly faults, i quit them all,
    and pray thee take this mercy to provide
    for better times to come. friar, advise him;
    i leave him to your hand. what muffl'd fellow's that?
  provost. this is a
