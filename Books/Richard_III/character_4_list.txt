Queen Elizabeth - 
 The wife of King Edward IV and the mother of the
two young princes (the heirs to the throne) and their older sister,
young Elizabeth. After Edward's death, Queen Elizabeth (also called
Lady Gray) is at Richard's mercy. Richard rightly views her as an
enemy because she opposes his rise to power, and because she is intelligent
and fairly strong-willed. Elizabeth is part of the Woodeville family;
her kinsmen--Dorset, Rivers, and Gray--are her allies in the court.
