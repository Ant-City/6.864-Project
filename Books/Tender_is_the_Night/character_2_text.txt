she demurred.
‘jolly good. my name is campion. here is a lady who says
she saw you in sorrento last week and knows who you are
and would so like to meet you.’

saw the untanned people were waiting. reluctantly she got
up and went over to them.
‘mrs. abrams—mrs. mckisco—mr. mckisco—mr.

‘we know who you are,’ spoke up the woman in evening
dress. ‘you’re rosemary hoyt and i recognized you in
sorrento and asked the hotel clerk and we all think you’re
perfectly marvellous and we want to know why you’re not
back in america making another marvellous moving picture.’
they made a superfluous gesture of moving over for her.
the woman who had recognized her was not a jewess, despite
her name. she was one of those elderly ‘good sports’
preserved by an imperviousness to experience and a good
digestion into another generation.
‘we wanted to warn you about g

he strolled into the bedchamber and lay down on her bed,
opening albert mckisco’s novel. presently rosemary came
in and sat beside him.
‘you have the longest eyelashes,’ she remarked.
‘we are now back at the junior prom. among those present
are miss rosemary hoyt, the eyelash fancier—‘
she kissed him and he pulled her down so that they lay
side by side, and then they kissed till they were both breathless.
her breathing was young and eager and exciting. her
lips were faintly chapped but soft in the corners.
when they were still limbs and feet and clothes, struggles
of his arms and back, and her throat and breasts, she
whispered, ‘no, not now—those things are rhythmic.’

rosemary interrupted him. ‘but is that really mary
north?’ she was regarding a woman sauntering in their direction
followed by a small group who behaved as if they
were accustomed to being looked at. when they were ten
feet away, mary’s glance flickered fractionally over the divers,
one of those unfortunate glances that indicate to the
glanced-upon that they have been observed but are to be
overlooked, the sort of glance that neither the divers nor
rosemary hoyt had ever permitted themselves to throw at
any one in their lives. dick was amused when mary perceived

he scarcely seemed to know what she was talking

‘where’s dick—is he lunching with us?’
seeing that his remark had meant comparatively little to
him she suddenly laughed away its effect.
‘dick’s on a tour,’ she said. ‘rosemary hoyt turned up,
and either they’re together or she upset him so much that he
wants to go away and dream about her.’
‘you know, you’re a little complicated after all.’
‘oh no,’ she assured him hastily. ‘no, i’m not really—i’m
