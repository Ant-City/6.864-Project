    be hung with caesar's trophies. i'll about
    and drive away the vulgar from the streets;
    so do you too, where you perceive them thick.
    these growing feathers pluck'd from caesar's wing
    will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
    who else would soar above the view of men
    and keep us all in servile fearfulness.              exeunt.

    of that quick spirit that is in antony.

    i'll leave you.
  cassius. brutus, i do observe you now of late;
    i have not from your eyes that gentleness
    and show of love as i was wont to have;
    you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
    over your friend that loves you.

    what hath proceeded worthy note today.
  brutus. i will do so. but, look you, cassius,
    the angry spot doth glow on caesar's brow,
    and all the rest look like a chidden train:
    calpurnia's cheek is pale, and cicero
    looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
    as we have seen him in the capitol,
    being cross'd in conference by some senators.
  cassius. casca will tell us what the matter is.
  caesar. antonio!
  antony. caesar?
  caesar. let me have men about me that are fat,
    sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
    yond cassius has a lean and hungry look;
    he thinks too much; such men are dangerous.
  antony. fear him not, caesar; he's not dangerous;
    he is a noble roman and well given.
  caesar. would he were fatter! but i fear him not,
    yet if my name were liable to fear,
    i do not know the man i should avoid
    so soon as that spare cassius. he reads much,
    he is a

 great observer, and he looks
    quite through the deeds of men. he loves no plays,
    as thou dost, antony; he hears no music;
    seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
    as if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
    that could be moved to smile at anything.
    such men as he be never at heart's ease
    whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
    and therefore are they very dangerous.
    i rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
    than what i fear, for always i am caesar.
    come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
    and tell me truly what thou think'st of him.

    he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the
     people fell ashouting.
  brutus. what was the second noise for?
  casca. why, for that too.
  cassius. they shouted thrice. what was the last cry for?
  casca. why, for that too.
  brutus. was the crown offered him thrice?
  casca. ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time
gentler
    than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbors
    shouted.
  cassius. who offered him the crown?
  casca. why, antony.
  brutus. tell us the manner of it, gentle casca.
  casca. i can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. it was
    mere foolery; i did not mark it. i saw mark antony offer him
a
    crown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these
    coronets) and, as i told you, he put it by once. but for all
    that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. then he
offered
    it to him again; then he put it by again. but, to my
thinking, he

    our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
    but all be buried in his gravity.
  brutus. o, name him not; let us not break with him,
    for he will never follow anything
    that other men begin.
  cassius. then leave him out.
  casca. indeed he is not fit.
  decius. shall no man else be touch'd but only caesar?
  cassius. decius, well urged. i think it is not meet
    mark antony, so well beloved of caesar,
    should outlive caesar. we shall find of him
    a shrewd contriver; and you know his means,
    if he improve them, may well stretch so far
    as to annoy us all, which to prevent,
    let antony and caesar fall together.
  brutus. our course will seem too bloody, caius cassius,
    to cut the head off and then hack the limbs
    like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
    for antony is but a limb of caesar.
    let us be sacrificers, but not butchers

, alas,
    caesar must bleed for it! and, gentle friends,
    let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
    let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
    not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;
    and let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
    stir up their servants to an act of rage
    and after seem to chide 'em. this shall make
    our purpose necessary and not envious,
    which so appearing to the common eyes,
    we shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
    and for mark antony, think not of him,
    for he can do no more than caesar's arm
    when caesar's head is off.
  cassius. yet i fear him,
    for in the ingrated love he bears to caesar-
  brutus. alas, good cassius, do not think of him.
    if he love caesar, all that he can do
    is to himself, take thought and die for caesar.
    and that were much he should, for he is given
    to sports, to wildness, and much company.
