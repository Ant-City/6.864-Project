[CHARACTER]  - 
      barabas's slave, whom the protagonist vows to make the heir to his estate after abigail's conversion to christianity. the men share a similar hatred for christians and vow to cause them as much disruption as they can. similarly, both are obsessed by money and the power that it affords. however, while barabas is a criminal mastermind, [CHARACTER] is more of a common thief and cutthroat. the slave fails his great test of loyalty when he falls for the prostitute bellamira, bribes barbabas, and confesses barabas's crimes to the governor. once again, marlowe shows how another person close to the protagonist abandons barabas. as with abigail, the merchant responds to this betrayal by killing [CHARACTER], along with his cohorts bellamira and pilia-borza.
