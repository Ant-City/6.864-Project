 it is a
gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old
hearts fresh: they that went on crutches ere he was born desire
yet their life to see him a man.

archidamus.
would they else be content to die?

camillo.
yes, if there were no other excuse why they should desire to
live.

archidamus.
if the king had no son, they would desire to live on crutches
till he had one.

nine changes of the watery star hath been
the shepherd's note since we have left our throne
without a burden: time as long again
would be fill'd up, my brother, with our thanks;
and yet we should, for perpetuity,
go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
yet standing in rich place, i multiply
with one we-thank-you many thousands more
that go before it.

leontes.
                   stay your thanks a while,
and pay them when

polixenes.
                    press me not, beseech you, so,
there is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
so soon as yours, could win me: so it should now,
were there necessity in your request, although
'twere needful i denied it. my affairs
do even drag me homeward: which to hinder,
were, in your love a whip to me; my stay
to you a charge and trouble: to save both,
farewell, our brother.

leontes.
                       tongue-tied, our queen? speak you.

hermione.
i had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
you had drawn oaths from him not to stay. you, sir,
charge him too coldly. tell him you are sure
all in bohemia's well: this satisfaction
the by-gone day proclaimed: say this to him,
he's beat from his best ward.

leontes.
                              well said, hermione.

hermione.
to tell he longs to see his son were strong:
but let him say so then, and let him go;
but let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
we'll thwack him he

yet of your royal presence i'll adventure
the borrow of a week. when at bohemia
you take my lord, i'll give him my commission
to let him there a month behind the gest
prefix'd for's parting:--yet, good deed, leontes,
i love thee not a jar of the clock behind
what lady she her lord.--you'll stay?

polixenes.
                        no, madam.

hermione.
nay, but you will?

polixenes.
                   i may not, verily.

hermione.
verily!
you put me off with limber vows; but i,
though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths,
should yet say 'sir, no going.' verily,
you shall not go; a lady's verily is
as potent as a lord's. will go yet?
force me to keep you as a prisoner,
not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees
when you depart, and save your thanks. how say you?
my prisoner or my guest? by your dread 'verily,'
one of them you shall be.

polixenes.
                     your guest, then, madam:

hermione.
                    not your gaoler then,
but your kind hostess. come, i'll question you
of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys.
you were pretty lordings then.

polixenes.
                     we were, fair queen,
two lads that thought there was no more behind
but such a day to-morrow as to-day,
and to be boy eternal.

hermione.
was not my lord the verier wag o' the two?

polixenes.
we were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun
and bleat the one at th' other. what we chang'd
was innocence for innocence; we knew not
the doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
that any did. had we pursu'd that life,
and our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
with stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
boldly 'not guilty,' the imposition clear'd
hereditary ours.

hermione.

polixenes.
                        o my most sacred lady,
temptations have since then been born to 's! for
in those unfledg'd days was my wife a girl;
your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
of my young play-fellow.

hermione.
                         grace to boot!
of this make no conclusion, lest you say
your queen and i are devils: yet, go on;
the offences we have made you do we'll answer;
if you first sinn'd with us, and that with us
you did continue fault, and that you slipp'd not
with any but with us.

leontes.
                      is he won yet?

hermione.
he'll stay, my lord.

leontes.
               at my request he would not.
hermione, my dearest, thou never spok'st
to better purpose.

slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.

with spur we heat an acre. but to the goal:--

                            why, that was when
three crabbèd months had sour'd themselves to death,
ere i could make thee open thy white hand
and clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter
'i am yours for ever.'

hermione.
                       it is grace indeed.
why, lo you now, i have spoke to the purpose twice;
the one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
th' other for some while a friend.

leontes.
                        no, in good earnest.--

you had a bastard by polixenes,

those of your fact are so,--so past all truth:

the bug which you would fright me with, i seek.
to me can life be no commodity:
the crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
i do give lost; for i do feel it gone,
but know not how it went: my second joy,
and first-fruits of my body, from his presence
