Sweet	 - 
                A
prostitute with whom Milkman has a brief affair. Unlike Milkman's
affairs with other women, especially Hagar, his relationship with
Sweet is mutually respectful and entirely reciprocal. His interactions
with her demonstrate that the most gratifying relationships in the
novel are those in which both partners treat each other as equals.
