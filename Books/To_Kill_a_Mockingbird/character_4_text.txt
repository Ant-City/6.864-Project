œif i didnâ€™t go to school tomorrow, youâ€™d force me to.â€
â€œlet us leave it at this,â€ said atticus dryly. â€œyou, miss scout finch, are of the
common folk. you must obey the law.â€ he said that the ewells were members of
an exclusive society made up of ewells. in certain circumstances the common
folk judiciously allowed them certain privileges by the simple method of
becoming blind to some of the ewellsâ€™ activities. they didnâ€™t have to go to
school, for one thing. another thing, mr. bob ewell, burrisâ€™s father, was
permitted to hunt and trap out of season.
â€œatticus, thatâ€™s bad,â€ i said. in maycomb county, hunting out of season was a
misdemeanor at law, a capital felony in the eyes of the populace.
â€œitâ€™s against the law, all right,â€ said my father, â€œand itâ€™s certainly bad, but when a
man spends his relief checks on green whiskey his children have a way of crying
from hunger pains. i donâ€™t know of any landowner around here who begrudges
those children any game their

â€œcal, i know tom robinsonâ€™s in jail anâ€˜ heâ€™s done somethinâ€™ awful, but why
wonâ€™t folks hire helen?â€ i asked.
calpurnia, in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat, walked between jem and me.
â€œitâ€™s because of what folks say tomâ€™s done,â€ she said. â€œfolks arenâ€™t anxious toâ€”

â€œjust what did he do, cal?â€
calpurnia sighed. â€œold mr. bob ewell accused him of rapinâ€˜ his girl anâ€™ had him
arrested anâ€˜ put in jailâ€”â€
â€œmr. ewell?â€ my memory stirred. â€œdoes he have anything to do with those
ewells that come every first day of school anâ€˜ then go home? why, atticus said
they were absolute trashâ€”i never heard atticus talk about folks the way he talked
about the ewells. he said-â€
â€œyeah, those are the ones.â€
â€œwell, if everybody in maycomb knows what kind of folks the ewells are theyâ€™d
be glad to hire helenâ€¦ whatâ€™

looking at a person when he was actually doing nothing of the kind, thus he was
hell on juries and witnesses. the jury, thinking themselves under close scrutiny,
paid attention; so did the witnesses, thinking likewise.
â€œâ€¦in your own words, mr. tate,â€ mr. gilmer was saying.
â€œwell,â€ said mr. tate, touching his glasses and speaking to his knees, â€œi was
calledâ€”â€
â€œcould you say it to the jury, mr. tate? thank you. who called you?â€
mr. tate said, â€œi was fetched by bobâ€”by mr. bob ewell yonder, one nightâ€”â€
â€œwhat night, sir?â€
mr. tate said, â€œit was the night of november twenty-first. i was just leaving my
office to go home when bâ€”mr. ewell came in, very excited he was, and said get

out to his house quick, some niggerâ€™d raped his girl.â€
â€œdid you go?â€
â€œcertainly. got in the car and went out as fast as i could.â€
â€œand what did you find?â€

â€œwho beat you up? tom robinson or your father?â€

when atticus turned away from mayella he looked like his stomach hurt, but
mayellaâ€™s face was a mixture of terror and fury. atticus sat down wearily and
polished his glasses with his handkerchief.
suddenly mayella became articulate. â€œi got somethinâ€˜ to say,â€ she said.
atticus raised his head. â€œdo you want to tell us what happened?â€
but she did not hear the compassion in his invitation. â€œi got somethinâ€˜ to say anâ€™

at that moment aunt alexandra came to the door and called us, but she was too

late. it was miss stephanieâ€™s pleasure to tell us: this morning mr. bob ewell
stopped atticus on the post office corner, spat in his face, and told him heâ€™d get
him if it took the rest of his life.

â€œi wish bob ewell wouldnâ€™t chew tobacco,â€ was all atticus said about it.
according to miss stephanie crawford, however, atticus was leaving the post
office when mr. ewell approached him, cursed him, spat on him, and threatened
to kill him. miss stephanie (who, by the time she had told it twice was there and
had seen it allâ€”passing

estroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he
had any to begin with. the man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind
always does. so if spitting in my face and threatening me saved mayella ewell
one extra beating, thatâ€™s something iâ€™ll gladly take. he had to take it out on
somebody and iâ€™d rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. you
understand?â€
jem nodded.
aunt alexandra entered the room as atticus was saying, â€œwe donâ€™t have anything
to fear from bob ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning.â€
â€œi wouldnâ€™t be so sure of that, atticus,â€ she said. â€œhis kindâ€™d do anything to pay
off a grudge. you know how those people are.â€
â€œwhat on earth could ewell do to me, sister?â€
â€œsomething furtive,â€ aunt alexandra said. â€œyou may count on that.â€
â€œnobody has much chance to be furtive in maycomb,â€ atticus answered.
after that, we were not afraid. summer was melting away, and we made the most
of it. atticus assured us that n

things did settle down, after a fashion, as atticus said they would. by the middle
of october, only two small things out of the ordinary happened to two maycomb
citizens. no, there were three things, and they did not directly concern usâ€”the
finchesâ€”but in a way they did.
the first thing was that mr. bob ewell acquired and lost a job in a matter of days
and probably made himself unique in the annals of the nineteen-thirties: he was
the only man i ever heard of who was fired from the wpa for laziness. i suppose

his brief burst of fame brought on a briefer burst of industry, but his job lasted
only as long as his notoriety: mr. ewell found himself as forgotten as tom
robinson. thereafter, he resumed his regular weekly appearances at the welfare
office for his check, and received it with no grace amid

 obscure mutterings that
the bastards who thought they ran this town wouldnâ€™t permit an honest man to
make a living. ruth jones, the welfare lady, said mr. ewell openly accused
atticus of getting his job. she was upset enough to walk down to atticusâ€™s office
and tell him about it. atticus told miss ruth not to fret, that if bob ewell wanted
to discuss atticusâ€™s â€œgettingâ€ his job, he knew the way to the office.
the second thing happened to judge taylor. judge taylor was not a sunday-night
churchgoer: mrs. taylor was. judge taylor savored his sunday night hour alone
in his big house, and churchtime found him holed up in his study reading the
writings of bob taylor (no kin, but the judge would have been proud to claim it).
one sunday night, lost in fruity metaphors and florid diction, judge taylorâ€™s
attention was wrenc

thought heâ€™d be a hero, but all he got for his pain wasâ€¦ was, okay, weâ€™ll convict
this negro but get back to your dump. heâ€™s had his fling with about everybody
now, so he ought to be satisfied. heâ€™ll settle down when the weather changes.â€
â€œbut why should he try to burgle john taylorâ€™s house? he obviously didnâ€™t know
john was home or he wouldnâ€™tâ€˜ve tried. only lights john shows on sunday nights
are on the front porch and back in his denâ€¦â€
â€œyou donâ€™t know if bob ewell cut that screen, you donâ€™t know who did it,â€ said
atticus. â€œbut i can guess. i proved him a liar but john made him look like a fool.
all the time ewell was on the stand i couldnâ€™t dare look at john and keep a
straight face. john looked at him as if he were a three-legged chicken or a square
egg. donâ€™t tell me judges donâ€™t try to prejudice juries,â€ atticus chuckled.
by the end of october, our lives had become the familiar routine of school, play,
study. jem seemed to have put out o

state or defense, and sometimes it took him a while.
â€œi found some funny-looking pieces of muddy-colored clothâ€”â€
â€œthatâ€™s mâ€™costume, mr. tate.â€
mr. tate ran his hands down his thighs. he rubbed his left arm and investigated
jemâ€™s mantelpiece, then he seemed to be interested in the fireplace. his fingers
sought his long nose.
â€œwhat is it, heck?â€ said atticus.
mr. tate found his neck and rubbed it. â€œbob ewellâ€™s lyinâ€˜ on the ground under
that tree down yonder with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs. heâ€™s dead, mr.
finch.â€

aunt alexandra got up and reached for the mantelpiece. mr. tate rose, but she
declined assistance. for once in his life, atticusâ€™s instinctive courtesy failed him:
he sat where he was.
somehow, i could think of nothing but mr. bob ewell saying heâ€™d get atticus if it
took him the rest of his life. mr. ewell almost got him, and it

rubbed his chin. â€œi wondered why he had those marks on him, his
sleeves were perforated with little holes. there were one or two little puncture

marks on his arms to match the holes. let me see that thing if you will, sir.â€
atticus fetched the remains of my costume. mr. tate turned it over and bent it
around to get an idea of its former shape. â€œthis thing probably saved her life,â€ he
said. â€œlook.â€
he pointed with a long forefinger. a shiny clean line stood out on the dull wire.
â€œbob ewell meant business,â€ mr. tate muttered.
â€œhe was out of his mind,â€ said atticus.
â€œdonâ€™t like to contradict you, mr. finchâ€”wasnâ€™t crazy, mean as hell. low-down
skunk with enough liquor in him to make him brave enough to kill children. heâ€™d
never have met you face to face.â€
atticus shook his head. â€œi canâ€™t conceive of a man whoâ€™dâ€”â€
â€œmr. finch, thereâ€™s just some kind of men you have to shoot before you can say
hidy to â€˜em. even then, they ainâ€™t worth the bullet it ta

 atticus was saying, â€œi guess the thing to doâ€”good lord, iâ€™m
losing my memoryâ€¦â€ atticus pushed up his glasses and pressed his fingers to his
eyes. â€œjemâ€™s not quite thirteenâ€¦ no, heâ€™s already thirteenâ€”i canâ€™t remember.
anyway, itâ€™ll come before county courtâ€”â€
â€œwhat will, mr. finch?â€ mr. tate uncrossed his legs and leaned forward.
â€œof course it was clear-cut self defense, but iâ€™ll have to go to the office and hunt
upâ€”â€
â€œmr. finch, do you think jem killed bob ewell? do you think that?â€
â€œyou heard what scout said, thereâ€™s no doubt about it. she said jem got up and
yanked him off herâ€”he probably got hold of ewellâ€™s knife somehow in the
darkâ€¦ weâ€™ll find out tomorrow.â€
â€œmis-ter finch, hold on,â€ said mr. tate. â€œjem never stabbed bob ewell.â€
atticus was silent for a moment. he looked at mr. tate as if he appreciated what
he said. but atticus shook his head.
â€œheck, itâ€™s mighty kind of you and i know youâ€™re doing it from that good he

thoughtâ€¦ iâ€”â€
â€œsee there, heck? thank you from the bottom of my heart, but i donâ€™t want my
boy starting out with something like this over his head. best way to clear the air is
to have it all out in the open. let the county come and bring sandwiches. i donâ€™t
want him growing up with a whisper about him, i donâ€™t want anybody saying,
â€˜jem finchâ€¦ his daddy paid a mint to get him out of that.â€™ sooner we get this
over with the better.â€
â€œmr. finch,â€ mr. tate said stolidly, â€œbob ewell fell on his knife. he killed
himself.â€
atticus walked to the corner of the porch. he looked at the wisteria vine. in his
own way, i thought, each was as stubborn as the other. i wondered who would
give in first. atticusâ€™s stubbornness was quiet and rarely evident, but in some
ways he was as set as the cunninghams. mr. tateâ€™s was unschooled and blunt, but
it was equal to my fatherâ€™s.
â€œheck,â€ atticusâ€™s back was turned. â€œif this thingâ€™s hushed up itâ€™ll be a simple
denial to jem

way iâ€™ve tried to raise him. sometimes i think iâ€™m a total
failure as a parent, but iâ€™m all theyâ€™ve got. before jem looks at anyone else he
looks at me, and iâ€™ve tried to live so i can look squarely back at himâ€¦ if i
connived at something like this, frankly i couldnâ€™t meet his eye, and the day i
canâ€™t do that iâ€™ll know iâ€™ve lost him. i donâ€™t want to lose him and scout, because
theyâ€™re all iâ€™ve got.â€

â€œmr. finch.â€ mr. tate was still planted to the floorboards. â€œbob ewell fell on his
knife. i can prove it.â€
atticus wheeled around. his hands dug into his pockets. â€œheck, canâ€™t you even
try to see it my way? youâ€™ve got children of your own, but iâ€™m older than you.
when mine are grown iâ€™ll be an old man if iâ€™m still around, but right now iâ€™mâ€”if
they donâ€™t trust me they wonâ€™t trust anybody. jem and scout know what
happened. if they hear of me saying downtown something different happenedâ€”

rdâ€™s lights went on. atticus and mr. tate looked
across the street, then at each other. they waited.
when mr. tate spoke again his voice was barely audible. â€œmr. finch, i hate to
fight you when youâ€™re like this. youâ€™ve been under a strain tonight no man should
ever have to go through. why you ainâ€™t in the bed from it i donâ€™t know, but i do
know that for once you havenâ€™t been able to put two and two together, and weâ€™ve
got to settle this tonight because tomorrowâ€™ll be too late. bob ewellâ€™s got a
kitchen knife in his craw.â€
mr. tate added that atticus wasnâ€™t going to stand there and maintain that any boy
jemâ€™s size with a busted arm had fight enough left in him to tackle and kill a
grown man in the pitch dark.
â€œheck,â€ said atticus abruptly, â€œthat was a switchblade you were waving. whereâ€™d
you get it?â€
â€œtook it off a drunk man,â€ mr. tate answered coolly.

between his knees. he was looking at the floor. he had moved with the same
slowness that night in front of the jail, when i thought it took him forever to fold
his newspaper and toss it in his chair.
mr. tate clumped softly around the porch. â€œit ainâ€™t your decision, mr. finch, itâ€™s
all mine. itâ€™s my decision and my responsibility. for once, if you donâ€™t see it my
way, thereâ€™s not much you can do about it. if you wanta try, iâ€™ll call you a liar to
your face. your boy never stabbed bob ewell,â€ he said slowly, â€œdidnâ€™t come near
a mile of it and now you know it. all he wanted to do was get him and his sister
safely home.â€

mr. tate stopped pacing. he stopped in front of atticus, and his back was to us.
â€œiâ€™m not a very good man, sir, but i am sheriff of maycomb county. lived in this
town all my life anâ€˜ iâ€™m goinâ€™ on forty-three years old. know everything thatâ€™s

on my head. if it was any other man, itâ€™d be different. but not this man, mr.
finch.â€
mr. tate was trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his boot. he pulled
his nose, then he massaged his left arm. â€œi may not be much, mr. finch, but iâ€™m
still sheriff of maycomb county and bob ewell fell on his knife. good night, sir.â€
mr. tate stamped off the porch and strode across the front yard. his car door
slammed and he drove away.
atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time. finally he raised his head.
â€œscout,â€ he said, â€œmr. ewell fell on his knife. can you possibly understand?â€
atticus looked like he needed cheering up. i ran to him and hugged him and
kissed him with all my might. â€œyes sir, i understand,â€ i reassured him. â€œmr. tate
was right.â€
atticus diseng
