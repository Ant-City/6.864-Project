and bashfull henry depos'd, whose cowardize
hath made vs by-words to our enemies

   plant. then leaue me not, my lords be resolute,
i meane to take possession of my right

   warw. neither the king, nor he that loues him best,
the prowdest hee that holds vp lancaster,
dares stirre a wing, if warwick shake his bells.
ile plant plantagenet, root him vp who dares:
resolue thee richard, clayme the english crowne.

westmerland, exeter,

  henry. my lords, looke where the sturdie rebell sits,
euen in the chayre of state: belike he meanes,
backt by the power of warwicke, that false peere,
to aspire vnto the crowne, and reigne as king.
earle of northumberland, he slew thy father,
and thine, lord clifford, & you both haue vow'd reuenge
on him, his sonnes, his fauorites, and his friends

   northumb. if i be not, heauens be reueng'd on me

   clifford. the hope thereof, makes clifford mourne in
steele
