red-brown, so unsheltered and unshaded, that i remember wondering how he
went to sleep. he was high-shouldered and bony; dressed in decent black,
with a white wisp of a neckcloth; buttoned up to the throat; and had a
long, lank, skeleton hand, which particularly attracted my attention, as
he stood at the ponyâ€™s head, rubbing his chin with it, and looking up at
us in the chaise.

â€˜is mr. wickfield at home, uriah heep?â€™ said my aunt.

â€˜mr. wickfieldâ€™s at home, maâ€™am,â€™ said uriah heep, â€˜if youâ€™ll please to
walk in thereâ€™--pointing with his long hand to the room he meant.

we got out; and leaving him to hold the pony, went into a long low
parlour looking towards the street, from the window of which i caught a
glimpse, as i went in, of uriah heep breathing into the ponyâ€™s nostrils,
and immediately covering them with his hand, as if he were putting
some spell upon him. opposite to the

my aunt seemed disposed to contest the point; but to facilitate matters
i said i would gladly remain behind, if they pleased; and returned into
mr. wickfieldâ€™s office, where i sat down again, in the chair i had first
occupied, to await their return.

it so happened that this chair was opposite a narrow passage, which
ended in the little circular room where i had seen uriah heepâ€™s pale
face looking out of the window. uriah, having taken the pony to a
neighbouring stable, was at work at a desk in this room, which had a
brass frame on the top to hang paper upon, and on which the writing he
was making a copy of was then hanging. though his face was towards me, i
thought, for some time, the writing being between us, that he could not
see me; but looking that way more attentively, it made me uncomfortable
to observe that, every now and then, his sleepless eyes woul

in his arms and kissed her, and, she being gone, ordered candles in his
office. then i went to bed too.

but in the course of the evening i had rambled down to the door, and a
little way along the street, that i might have another peep at the old
houses, and the grey cathedral; and might think of my coming through
that old city on my journey, and of my passing the very house i lived
in, without knowing it. as i came back, i saw uriah heep shutting up
the office; and feeling friendly towards everybody, went in and spoke
to him, and at parting, gave him my hand. but oh, what a clammy hand his
was! as ghostly to the touch as to the sight! i rubbed mine afterwards,
to warm it, and to rub his off.

it was such an uncomfortable hand, that, when i went to my room, it was
still cold and wet upon my memory. leaning out of the window, and seeing
one of the faces on the beam-ends looking at me sideways, i fancied it
was uriah heep

anything. he is the least suspicious of mankind; and whether thatâ€™s
a merit, or whether itâ€™s a blemish, it deserves consideration in all
dealings with the doctor, great or small.â€™

he spoke, i thought, as if he were weary, or dissatisfied with
something; but i did not pursue the question in my mind, for dinner was
just then announced, and we went down and took the same seats as before.

we had scarcely done so, when uriah heep put in his red head and his
lank hand at the door, and said:

â€˜hereâ€™s mr. maldon begs the favour of a word, sir.â€™

â€˜i am but this moment quit of mr. maldon,â€™ said his master.

â€˜yes, sir,â€™ returned uriah; â€˜but mr. maldon has come back, and he begs
the favour of a word.â€™

as he held the door open with his hand, uriah looked at me, and looked
at agnes, and looked at the dishes, and looked at the plates, and looked
at every object in the room, i thought,--yet seemed to

at night after agnes had left us, or when i wished to read for my own
pleasure, i was free to come down to his room, if he were there and if
i desired it for companyâ€™s sake, and to sit with him. i thanked him for
his consideration; and, as he went down soon afterwards, and i was
not tired, went down too, with a book in my hand, to avail myself, for
half-an-hour, of his permission.

but, seeing a light in the little round office, and immediately feeling
myself attracted towards uriah heep, who had a sort of fascination for
me, i went in there instead. i found uriah reading a great fat book,
with such demonstrative attention, that his lank forefinger followed up
every line as he read, and made clammy tracks along the page (or so i
fully believed) like a snail.

â€˜you are working late tonight, uriah,â€™ says i.

â€˜yes, master copperfield,â€™ says uriah.

as i was getting on the stool opposite, to talk to him more
conveniently, i observed that he had not such a thing a

for some time.

â€˜me, master copperfield?â€™ said uriah. â€˜oh, no! iâ€™m a very umble person.â€™

it was no fancy of mine about his hands, i observed; for he frequently
ground the palms against each other as if to squeeze them dry and
warm, besides often wiping them, in a stealthy way, on his
pocket-handkerchief.

â€˜i am well aware that i am the umblest person going,â€™ said uriah heep,
modestly; â€˜let the other be where he may. my mother is likewise a very
umble person. we live in a numble abode, master copperfield, but have
much to be thankful for. my fatherâ€™s former calling was umble. he was a
sexton.â€™

â€˜what is he now?â€™ i asked.

â€˜he is a partaker of glory at present, master copperfield,â€™ said uriah
heep. â€˜but we have much to be thankful for. how much have i to be
thankful for in living with mr. wickfield!â€™

myself, though he was a friend of my auntâ€™s.

â€˜oh, indeed, master copperfield,â€™ said uriah. â€˜your aunt is a sweet
lady, master copperfield!â€™

he had a way of writhing when he wanted to express enthusiasm, which was
very ugly; and which diverted my attention from the compliment he had
paid my relation, to the snaky twistings of his throat and body.

â€˜a sweet lady, master copperfield!â€™ said uriah heep. â€˜she has a great
admiration for miss agnes, master copperfield, i believe?â€™

i said, â€˜yes,â€™ boldly; not that i knew anything about it, heaven forgive
me!

â€˜i hope you have, too, master copperfield,â€™ said uriah. â€˜but i am sure
you must have.â€™

â€˜everybody must have,â€™ i returned.

â€˜oh, thank you, master copperfield,â€™ said uriah heep, â€˜for that remark!

â€˜i have discovered my friend copperfield,â€™ said mr. micawber genteelly,
and without addressing himself particularly to anyone, â€˜not in solitude,
but partaking of a social meal in company with a widow lady, and one who
is apparently her offspring--in short,â€™ said mr. micawber, in another
of his bursts of confidence, â€˜her son. i shall esteem it an honour to be
presented.â€™

i could do no less, under these circumstances, than make mr. micawber
known to uriah heep and his mother; which i accordingly did. as they
abased themselves before him, mr. micawber took a seat, and waved his
hand in his most courtly manner.

â€˜any friend of my friend copperfieldâ€™s,â€™ said mr. micawber, â€˜has a
personal claim upon myself.â€™

â€˜we are too umble, sir,â€™ said mrs. heep, â€˜my son and me, to be the
friends of master copperfield. he has been so good as take his tea with
us, and we are thankful to him for his company, also to you, sir, for
your notice.â€

would arrive by that post), and propose the day after, if it would suit
me better. accordingly i was called out of school next forenoon, and
found mr. micawber in the parlour; who had called to say that the dinner
would take place as proposed. when i asked him if the remittance had
come, he pressed my hand and departed.

as i was looking out of window that same evening, it surprised me, and
made me rather uneasy, to see mr. micawber and uriah heep walk past, arm
in arm: uriah humbly sensible of the honour that was done him, and mr.
micawber taking a bland delight in extending his patronage to uriah. but
i was still more surprised, when i went to the little hotel next day at
the appointed dinner-hour, which was four oâ€™clock, to find, from what
mr. micawber said, that he had gone home with uriah, and had drunk
brandy-and-water at mrs. heepâ€™s.

but morning brought with it my parting from the old house, which agnes
had filled with her influence; and that occupied my mind sufficiently.
i should be there again soon, no doubt; i might sleep again--perhaps
often--in my old room; but the days of my inhabiting there were gone,
and the old time was past. i was heavier at heart when i packed up such
of my books and clothes as still remained there to be sent to dover,
than i cared to show to uriah heep; who was so officious to help me,
that i uncharitably thought him mighty glad that i was going.

i got away from agnes and her father, somehow, with an indifferent show
of being very manly, and took my seat upon the box of the london coach.
i was so softened and forgiving, going through the town, that i had half
a mind to nod to my old enemy the butcher, and throw him five shillings
to drink. but he looked such a very obdurate butcher as he stood
scraping the great block in the shop, an

agnes laughed again at her own penetration, and told me that if i were
faithful to her in my confidence she thought she should keep a little
register of my violent attachments, with the date, duration, and
termination of each, like the table of the reigns of the kings and
queens, in the history of england. then she asked me if i had seen
uriah.

â€˜uriah heep?â€™ said i. â€˜no. is he in london?â€™

â€˜he comes to the office downstairs, every day,â€™ returned agnes. â€˜he
was in london a week before me. i am afraid on disagreeable business,
trotwood.â€™

â€˜on some business that makes you uneasy, agnes, i see,â€™ said i. â€˜what
can that be?â€™

agnes laid aside her work, and replied, folding her hands upon one
another, and looking pensively at me out of those beautiful soft eyes of
hers:

mrs. henry spiker was this ladyâ€™s name; and her husband was there
too: so cold a man, that his head, instead of being grey, seemed to
be sprinkled with hoar-frost. immense deference was shown to the henry
spikers, male and female; which agnes told me was on account of mr.
henry spiker being solicitor to something or to somebody, i forget what
or which, remotely connected with the treasury.

i found uriah heep among the company, in a suit of black, and in deep
humility. he told me, when i shook hands with him, that he was proud
to be noticed by me, and that he really felt obliged to me for my
condescension. i could have wished he had been less obliged to me, for
he hovered about me in his gratitude all the rest of the evening; and
whenever i said a word to agnes, was sure, with his shadowless eyes and
cadaverous face, to be looking gauntly down upon us from behind.

mrs. crupp with particular directions to leave the windows open, that my
sitting-room might be aired, and purged of his presence.

at the coach office to take leave of her and see her go; and there was
he, returning to canterbury by the same conveyance. it was some small
satisfaction to me to observe his spare, short-waisted, high-shouldered,
mulberry-coloured great-coat perched up, in company with an umbrella
like a small tent, on the edge of the back seat on the roof, while
agnes was, of course, inside; but what i underwent in my efforts to be

commons rejected; and still, more or less conscious of my own room, i
was always tossing about like a distressed ship in a sea of bed-clothes.

my aunt was restless, too, for i frequently heard her walking to and

a disturbed ghost, in my room, and came to the side of the sofa on which

she had stated therein that she had fallen into adversity, and was
leaving dover for good, but had quite made up her mind to it, and was
so well that nobody need be uncomfortable about her. agnes had come to
london to see my aunt, between whom and herself there had been a mutual
liking these many years: indeed, it dated from the time of my taking up
my residence in mr. wickfieldâ€™s house. she was not alone, she said. her
papa was with her--and uriah heep.

â€˜and now they are partners,â€™ said i. â€˜confound him!â€™

â€˜yes,â€™ said agnes. â€˜they have some business here; and i took advantage
of their coming, to come too. you must not think my visit all friendly
and disinterested, trotwood, for--i am afraid i may be cruelly
prejudiced--i do not like to let papa go away alone, with him.â€™ â€˜does he

i looked at agnes when she said these words, without detecting in her
any consciousness of uriahâ€™s design. her mild but earnest eyes met
mine with their own beautiful frankness, and there was no change in her
gentle face.

â€˜the chief evil of their presence in the house,â€™ said agnes, â€˜is that i
cannot be as near papa as i could wish--uriah heep being so much between
us--and cannot watch over him, if that is not too bold a thing to say,
as closely as i would. but if any fraud or treachery is practising
against him, i hope that simple love and truth will be strong in the
end. i hope that real love and truth are stronger in the end than any
evil or misfortune in the world.â€™

bore a prominent part, was being effected in every corner of my rooms,
in regard of this pepper; and i was looking on, thinking how little even
peggotty seemed to do with a good deal of bustle, and how much agnes did
without any bustle at all, when a knock came at the door.

â€˜i think,â€™ said agnes, turning pale, â€˜itâ€™s papa. he promised me that he
would come.â€™

i opened the door, and admitted, not only mr. wickfield, but uriah heep.
i had not seen mr. wickfield for some time. i was prepared for a great
change in him, after what i had heard from agnes, but his appearance
shocked me.

it was not that he looked many years older, though still dressed
with the old scrupulous cleanliness; or that there was an unwholesome
ruddiness upon his face; or that his eyes were full and bloodshot; or
that there was a nervous trembling in his hand, the cause of which i
knew, and had for some years seen at work. it was not that he

his good looks, or his old bearing of a gentleman--for that he had
not--but the thing that struck me most, was, that with the evidences of
his native superiority still upon him, he should submit himself to that
crawling impersonation of meanness, uriah heep. the reversal of the
two natures, in their relative positions, uriahâ€™s of power and mr.
wickfieldâ€™s of dependence, was a sight more painful to me than i can
express. if i had seen an ape taking command of a man, i should hardly
have thought it a more degrading spectacle.

he appeared to be only too conscious of it himself. when he came in, he
stood still; and with his head bowed, as if he felt it. this was
only for a moment; for agnes softly said to him, â€˜papa! here is miss

time. â€˜i have been telling your daughter how well i have been disposing
of my money for myself, because i couldnâ€™t trust it to you, as you were
growing rusty in business matters. we have been taking counsel together,
and getting on very well, all things considered. agnes is worth the
whole firm, in my opinion.â€™

â€˜if i may umbly make the remark,â€™ said uriah heep, with a writhe, â€˜i
fully agree with miss betsey trotwood, and should be only too appy if
miss agnes was a partner.â€™

â€˜youâ€™re a partner yourself, you know,â€™ returned my aunt, â€˜and thatâ€™s
about enough for you, i expect. how do you find yourself, sir?â€™

in acknowledgement of this question, addressed to him with extraordinary
curtness, mr. heep, uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried,
replied that he was pretty well, he thanked my aunt, and hoped she was
the same.

of knowing her, when i was a numble clerk, before you did, master

quicker by present circumstances. the wonder is, that it isnâ€™t much
worse! i only called to say that if there was anything we could do, in
present circumstances, mother or self, or wickfield and heep,--we should
be really glad. i may go so far?â€™ said uriah, with a sickly smile at his
partner.

â€˜uriah heep,â€™ said mr. wickfield, in a monotonous forced way, â€˜is active
in the business, trotwood. what he says, i quite concur in. you know
i had an old interest in you. apart from that, what uriah says i quite
concur in!â€™

â€˜oh, what a reward it is,â€™ said uriah, drawing up one leg, at the risk
of bringing down upon himself another visitation from my aunt, â€˜to be so
trusted in! but i hope i am able to do something to relieve him from the
fatigues of business, master copperfield!â€™

â€˜uriah heep is a great relief to me,â€™ said mr. wickfield, in the same

the red fox made him say all this, i knew, to exhibit him to me in the
light he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest. i saw the
same ill-favoured smile upon his face again, and saw how he watched me.

who had gazed upon them; the still nooks, where the ivied growth of

softening spirit.

mr. micawber plying his pen with great assiduity. he was dressed in a
legal-looking suit of black, and loomed, burly and large, in that small
office.

mr. micawber was extremely glad to see me, but a little confused too.
he would have conducted me immediately into the presence of uriah, but i
declined.

â€˜i know the house of old, you recollect,â€™ said i, â€˜and will find my way

imaginative powers, the objection to legal studies is the amount of

said mr. micawber, glancing at some letters he was writing, â€˜the mind is
not at liberty to soar to any exalted form of expression. still, it is a
great pursuit. a great pursuit!â€™

he then told me that he had become the tenant of uriah heepâ€™s old house;
and that mrs. micawber would be delighted to receive me, once more,
under her own roof.

â€˜it is humble,â€™ said mr. micawber, â€˜--to quote a favourite expression
of my friend heep; but it may prove the stepping-stone to more ambitious
domiciliary accommodation.â€™

i asked him whether he had reason, so far, to be satisfied with his
friend heepâ€™s treatment of him? he got up to ascertain if the door were
close shut, before he replied, in a lower voice:

i had no longer any doubt on the subject. with a lightened heart, though
with a profound sense of the weighty importance of my task, i devoted
the whole afternoon to the composition of the draft of this letter; for
which great purpose, agnes relinquished her desk to me. but first i went
downstairs to see mr. wickfield and uriah heep.

i found uriah in possession of a new, plaster-smelling office, built out
in the garden; looking extraordinarily mean, in the midst of a quantity
of books and papers. he received me in his usual fawning way, and
pretended not to have heard of my arrival from mr. micawber; a
pretence i took the liberty of disbelieving. he accompanied me into mr.
wickfieldâ€™s room, which was the shadow of its former self--having been
divested of a variety of conveniences, for the accommodation of the ne

i had not an opportunity of speaking to agnes, for ten minutes. i could
barely show her my letter. i proposed to her to walk out with me; but
mrs. heep repeatedly complaining that she was worse, agnes charitably
remained within, to bear her company. towards the twilight i went out
by myself, musing on what i ought to do, and whether i was justified
in withholding from agnes, any longer, what uriah heep had told me in
london; for that began to trouble me again, very much.

i had not walked out far enough to be quite clear of the town, upon the
ramsgate road, where there was a good path, when i was hailed, through
the dust, by somebody behind me. the shambling figure, and the scanty
great-coat, were not to be mistaken. i stopped, and uriah heep came up.

â€˜well?â€™ said i.

had been roused was leaving him. uriah came out of his corner.

putting out his hands, as if to deprecate my condemnation. â€˜he knows

whispering me. you see the millstone that he is about my neck. you

i have exposed one whom i hold in my heart, to trials and aspersions--i
call them aspersions, even to have been conceived in anybodyâ€™s inmost

uriah heep gave a kind of snivel. i think to express sympathy.

the handsomest and most romantic figure ever imagined by painter,

of having known that he was not quite in his wits, taking account of the
utmost i have done with mine.

â€˜nobody but myself, trot, knows what that man is!â€™ my aunt would proudly
remark, when we conversed about it. â€˜dick will distinguish himself yet!â€™

i must refer to one other topic before i close this chapter. while the
visit at the doctorâ€™s was still in progress, i observed that the postman
brought two or three letters every morning for uriah heep, who remained
at highgate until the rest went back, it being a leisure time; and that
these were always directed in a business-like manner by mr. micawber,
who now assumed a round legal hand. i was glad to infer, from these
slight premises, that mr. micawber was doing well; and consequently was
much surprised to receive, about this time, the following letter from
his amiable wife.



                         â€˜canterbury, monday evening.

â€˜you will doubtless be surprised, my dear

our hands. i trust it
confidently to your not suppressing anything. i know beforehand that
nothing you, or anyone, can tell me, will show my husbandâ€™s noble heart
in any other light than one. howsoever it may seem to you to touch me,
disregard that. i will speak for myself, before him, and before god
afterwards.â€™

thus earnestly besought, i made no reference to the doctor for his
permission, but, without any other compromise of the truth than a little
softening of the coarseness of uriah heep, related plainly what had
passed in that same room that night. the staring of mrs. markleham
during the whole narration, and the shrill, sharp interjections with
which she occasionally interrupted it, defy description.

when i had finished, annie remained, for some few moments, silent, with
her head bent down, as i have described. then, she took the doctorâ€™s
hand (he was sitting in the same attitude as when we had entered the
room), and pressed it to her breast, and kissed it. mr. dic

â€˜is miss wickfield at home?â€™ said i.

â€˜mr. wickfield is unwell in bed, sir, of a rheumatic fever,â€™ he
returned; â€˜but miss wickfield, i have no doubt, will be happy to see old
friends. will you walk in, sir?â€™

he preceded us to the dining-room--the first room i had entered in that
house--and flinging open the door of mr. wickfieldâ€™s former office,
said, in a sonorous voice:

â€˜miss trotwood, mr. david copperfield, mr. thomas traddles, and mr.
dixon!â€™

i had not seen uriah heep since the time of the blow. our visit
astonished him, evidently; not the less, i dare say, because it
astonished ourselves. he did not gather his eyebrows together, for he
had none worth mentioning; but he frowned to that degree that he almost
closed his small eyes, while the hurried raising of his grisly hand to
his chin betrayed some trepidation or surprise. this was only when we
were in the act of entering his room, and when i caught a glance at him
over my auntâ€™s shoulder. a moment

their style of composition, he began to read as follows:


â€˜â€œdear miss trotwood and gentlemen--â€œâ€™

â€˜bless and save the man!â€™ exclaimed my aunt in a low voice. â€˜heâ€™d write
letters by the ream, if it was a capital offence!â€™

mr. micawber, without hearing her, went on.

â€˜â€œin appearing before you to denounce probably the most consummate
villain that has ever existed,â€â€™ mr. micawber, without looking off the
letter, pointed the ruler, like a ghostly truncheon, at uriah heep,
â€˜â€œi ask no consideration for myself. the victim, from my cradle, of
pecuniary liabilities to which i have been unable to respond, i have
ever been the sport and toy of debasing circumstances. ignominy,
want, despair, and madness, have, collectively or separately, been the
attendants of my career.â€â€™

the relish with which mr. micawber described himself as a prey to these
dismal calamities, was only to be equalled by the emphasis with which he
read his letter; and the kind of ho

self with the ruler. â€˜i did, when i got the key
from you as usual--but a little earlier--and opened it this morning.â€™

â€˜donâ€™t be uneasy,â€™ said traddles. â€˜they have come into my possession. i
will take care of them, under the authority i mentioned.â€™

â€˜you receive stolen goods, do you?â€™ cried uriah.

â€˜under such circumstances,â€™ answered traddles, â€˜yes.â€™

what was my astonishment when i beheld my aunt, who had been profoundly
quiet and attentive, make a dart at uriah heep, and seize him by the
collar with both hands!

â€˜you know what i want?â€™ said my aunt.

â€˜a strait-waistcoat,â€™ said he.

â€˜no. my property!â€™ returned my aunt. â€˜agnes, my dear, as long as
i believed it had been really made away with by your father, i
wouldnâ€™t--and, my dear, i didnâ€™t, even to trot, as he knows--breathe a
syllable of its having been placed here for investment. but, now i know
this fellowâ€™s answerable for it, and iâ€™ll have it! trot, come and take

n which he has been diving, day and night, among
papers and books; to say nothing of the immense number of letters he has
written me between this house and mr. wickfieldâ€™s, and often across the
table when he has been sitting opposite, and might much more easily have
spoken; is quite extraordinary.â€™

â€˜letters!â€™ cried my aunt. â€˜i believe he dreams in letters!â€™

â€˜thereâ€™s mr. dick, too,â€™ said traddles, â€˜has been doing wonders! as soon
as he was released from overlooking uriah heep, whom he kept in such
charge as i never saw exceeded, he began to devote himself to mr.
wickfield. and really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations we
have been making, and his real usefulness in extracting, and copying,
and fetching, and carrying, have been quite stimulating to us.â€™

â€˜dick is a very remarkable man,â€™ exclaimed my aunt; â€˜and i always said
he was. trot, you know it.â€™

â€˜i am happy to say, miss wickfield,â€™ pursued traddles, at once with

. â€˜many
people can be very mean, when they give their minds to it.â€™

â€˜and now, touching mr. micawber,â€™ said my aunt.

â€˜well, really,â€™ said traddles, cheerfully, â€˜i must, once more, give mr.
micawber high praise. but for his having been so patient and persevering
for so long a time, we never could have hoped to do anything worth
speaking of. and i think we ought to consider that mr. micawber did
right, for rightâ€™s sake, when we reflect what terms he might have made
with uriah heep himself, for his silence.â€™

â€˜i think so too,â€™ said i.

â€˜now, what would you give him?â€™ inquired my aunt.

â€˜oh! before you come to that,â€™ said traddles, a little disconcerted,
â€˜i am afraid i thought it discreet to omit (not being able to carry
everything before me) two points, in making this lawless adjustment--for
itâ€™s perfectly lawless from beginning to end--of a difficult affair.
those i.o.u.â€™s, and so forth, which mr. micawber gave him for the
advances he had--

s did so, shortly afterwards, with perfect good will
and harmony.

seeing that traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again, i reminded
him of the second and last point to which he had adverted.

â€˜you and your aunt will excuse me, copperfield, if i touch upon a
painful theme, as i greatly fear i shall,â€™ said traddles, hesitating;
â€˜but i think it necessary to bring it to your recollection. on the day
of mr. micawberâ€™s memorable denunciation a threatening allusion was made
by uriah heep to your auntâ€™s--husband.â€™

my aunt, retaining her stiff position, and apparent composure, assented
with a nod.

â€˜perhaps,â€™ observed traddles, â€˜it was mere purposeless impertinence?â€™

â€˜no,â€™ returned my aunt.

â€˜there was--pardon me--really such a person, and at all in his power?â€™
hinted traddles.

â€˜yes, my good friend,â€™ said my aunt.

traddles, with a perceptible lengthening of his face, explained that he
had not been able to approach this subject; that it h

ad shared the fate
of mr. micawberâ€™s liabilities, in not being comprehended in the terms he
had made; that we were no longer of any authority with uriah heep; and
that if he could do us, or any of us, any injury or annoyance, no doubt
he would.

my aunt remained quiet; until again some stray tears found their way to
her cheeks. â€˜you are quite right,â€™ she said. â€˜it was very thoughtful to
mention it.â€™

â€˜can i--or copperfield--do anything?â€™ asked traddles, gently.

â€˜nothing,â€™ said my aunt. â€˜i thank you many times. trot, my dear, a vain
threat! let us have mr. and mrs. micawber back. and donâ€™t any of you
speak to me!â€™ w

sent,--and so much to the
awakening of mr. micawberâ€™s punctual habits in the opening stage of
all bill transactions, that he could not be dissuaded from immediately
rushing out, in the highest spirits, to buy the stamps for his notes of
hand. but, his joy received a sudden check; for within five minutes,
he returned in the custody of a sheriff â€˜s officer, informing us, in
a flood of tears, that all was lost. we, being quite prepared for this
event, which was of course a proceeding of uriah heepâ€™s, soon paid the
money; and in five minutes more mr. micawber was seated at the table,
filling up the stamps with an expression of perfect joy, which only
that congenial employment, or the making of punch, could impart in full
completeness to his shining face. to see him at work on the stamps, with
the relish of an artist, touching them like pictures, looking at them
sideways, taking weighty notes of dates and amounts in his pocket-book,

i cannot say that i was yet quite happy, in the hope that i was gaining
a victory over myself; even in the prospect of so soon looking on her
face again.

the well-remembered ground was soon traversed, and i came into the quiet
streets, where every stone was a boyâ€™s book to me. i went on foot to the
old house, and went away with a heart too full to enter. i returned; and
looking, as i passed, through the low window of the turret-room where
first uriah heep, and afterwards mr. micawber, had been wont to sit,
saw that it was a little parlour now, and that there was no office.
otherwise the staid old house was, as to its cleanliness and order,
still just as it had been when i first saw it. i requested the new maid
who admitted me, to tell miss wickfield that a gentleman who waited on
her from a friend abroad, was there; and i was shown up the grave old
staircase (cautioned of the steps i knew so well), into the unchanged
drawing-room. the boo

here was such a rush of heads immediately, to see number twenty seven
reading his hymn book, that the little hole was blocked up, six or seven
heads deep. to remedy this inconvenience, and give us an opportunity of
conversing with twenty seven in all his purity, mr. creakle directed the
door of the cell to be unlocked, and twenty seven to be invited out into
the passage. this was done; and whom should traddles and i then behold,
to our amazement, in this converted number twenty seven, but uriah heep!

he knew us directly; and said, as he came out--with the old writhe,--

â€˜how do you do, mr. copperfield? how do you do, mr. traddles?â€™

this recognition caused a general admiration in the party. i rather
thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud, and taking
notice of us.

â€˜well, twenty seven,â€™ said mr. creakle, mournfully admiring him. â€˜how do
you find yourself today?â€™

â€˜i am very umble, sir!â€™ replied uriah heep.

â€˜you are always so, twenty seven,

here, another gentleman asked, with extreme anxiety: â€˜are you quite
comfortable?â€™

â€˜yes, i thank you, sir!â€™ said uriah heep, looking in that direction.
â€˜far more comfortable here, than ever i was outside. i see my follies,
now, sir. thatâ€™s what makes me comfortable.â€™

several gentlemen were much affected; and a third questioner, forcing
himself to the front, inquired with extreme feeling: â€˜how do you find
the beef?â€™

â€˜thank you, sir,â€™ replied uriah, glancing in the new direction of this
voice, â€˜it was tougher yesterday than i could wish; but itâ€™s my duty to
bear. i have committed follies,
