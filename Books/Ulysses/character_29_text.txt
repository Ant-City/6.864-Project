his joyful fingers in the air.

show you the new beauty rock has for a bailiff. heâ€™s a cross between
lobengula and lynchehaun. heâ€™s well worth seeing, mind you. come along.

of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.

through with a crack.)

a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

indicates vaguely lynch and bloom.) we are all in the same sweepstake,

adds his head to the group.)

florry: (strives heavily to rise.) ow! my footâ€™s asleep. (she limps over
to the table. bloom approaches.)

throws it in the grate.)

the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of father dolan springs up.)
