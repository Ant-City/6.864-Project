interpreter of maladies
attheteastall mr. and mrs. das bickered about who should take tina to the toilet.
eventually mrs. das relented when mr. das pointed out that he had given the girl her
bath the night before. in the rearview mirror mr. kapasi watched as mrs. das emerged
slowly from his bulky white ambassador, dragging her shaved, largely bare legs across
the back seat. she did not hold the little girlâ€™s hand as they walked to the rest room.
they were on their way to see the sun temple at konarak. it was a dry, bright
saturday, the mid-july heat tempered by a steady ocean breeze, ideal weather for
sightseeing. ordinarily mr. kapasi would not have stopped so soon along the way, but
less than five minutes after heâ€™d picked up the f

amily that morning in front of hotel
sandy villa, the little girl had complained. the first thing mr. kapasi had noticed when
he saw mr. and mrs. das, standing with their children under the portico of the hotel, was
that they were very young, perhaps not even thirty. in addition to tina they had two
boys, ronny and bobby, who appeared very close in age and had teeth covered in a
network of flashing silver wires. the family looked indian but dressed as foreigners did,
the children in stiff, brightly colored clothing and caps with translucent visors. mr. kapasi
was accustomed to foreign tourists; he was

 assigned to them regularly because he
could speak english. yesterday he had driven an elderly couple from scotland, both
with spotted faces and fluffywhite hair so thin it exposed their sunburnt scalps. in
comparison, the tanned, youthful faces of mr. and mrs. das were all the more striking.
when heâ€™d introduced himself, mr. kapasi had pressed his palms together in greeting,
but mr. das squeezed hands like an american so that mr. kapasi felt it in his elbow.
mrs. das, for her part, had flexed one side of her mouth, smiling dutifully at mr. kapasi,
without displaying any interest in him.
as they waited at the tea stall, ronny, who looked like the older of the two boys,
clambered suddenly out of the back seat, intrigued by a goat tied to a stake in the
ground.
â€œdonâ€™t touch it,â€mr. das said. he glanced up from his paperback tour book, which said
â€œindiaâ€in yellow letters and looked as if it had been published abroad. his

und his neck, with an impressive telephoto lens and numerous buttons and
markings, was the only complicated thing he wore. he frowned, watching as ronny
rushed toward the goat, but appeared to have no intention of intervening. â€œbobby, make
sure that your brother doesnâ€™t do anything stupid.â€
â€œidonâ€™t feel like it,â€bobby said, not moving. he was sitting in the front seat beside mr.
kapasi, studying a picture of the elephant god taped to the glove compartment.
â€œno need to worry,â€ mr. kapasi said. â€œthey are quite tame.â€ mr. kapasi was forty-six
years old, with receding hair that had gone completely silver, but his butterscotch
complexion and his unlined brow, which he treated in spare moments to dabs of lotusoil
balm, made it easy to imagine what he must have looked like at an earlier age. he
wore gray trousers and a matching jacket-style shirt, tapered at the waist, with short
sleeves and a large pointed collar, made of a thin but durable synthetic material. he had

oth the cut and the fabric to his tailorâ€”it was his preferred uniform for giving
tours because it did not get crushed during his long hours behind the wheel. through
the windshield he watched as ronny circled around the goat, touched it quickly on its
side, then trotted back to the car.
â€œyou left india as a child?â€ mr. kapasi asked when mr. das had settled once again into
the passenger seat.
â€œoh, mina and i were both born in america,â€ mr. das announced with an air of sudden
confidence. â€œborn and raised. our parents live here now. they retired. we visit them
every couple years.â€ he turned to watch as the little girl ran toward the car, the wide
purple bows of her sundress flopping on her narrow brown shoulders. she was holding
to her chest a doll with yellow hair that looked as if it had been chopped, as a pu

measure, with a pair of dull scissors. â€œthis is tinaâ€™s first trip to india, isnâ€™t it, tina?â€
â€œidonâ€™t have to go to the bathroom anymore,â€ tina announced.
â€œwhereâ€™s mina?â€ mr. das asked.
mr. kapasi found it strange that mr. das should refer to his wife by her first name when
speaking to the little girl. tina pointed to where mrs. das was purchasing something
from one of the shirtless men who worked at the tea stall. mr. kapasi heard one of the
shirtless men sing a phrase from a popular hindi love song as mrs. das walked back to
the car, but she did not appear to understand the words of the song, for she did not
express irritation, or embarrassment, or react in any other way to the manâ€™s
declarations.
he observed her. she wore a red-and-white-checkered skirt that stopped above her
knees, slip-on shoes with a square wooden heel, and a close-fitting blouse styled like a
manâ€™s undershirt. the blouse was decorated at

paws, her frosty
pink fingernails painted to match her lips, and was slightly plump in her figure. her hair,
shorn only a little longer than her husbandâ€™s, was parted far to one side. she was
wearing large dark brown sunglasses with a pinkish tint to them, and carried a big straw
bag, almost as big as her torso, shaped like a bowl, with a water bottle poking out of it.
she walked slowly, carrying some puffed rice tossed with peanuts and chili peppers in a
large packet made from newspapers. mr. kapasi turned to mr. das.
â€œwhere in america do you live?â€
â€œnew brunswick, new jersey.â€
â€œnext to new york?â€
â€œexactly. i teach middle school there.â€
â€œwhat subject?â€
â€œscience. in fact, every year i take my students on a trip to the museum of natural
history in new york city. in a way we have a lot in common, you could say, you and i.
how long have you been a tour guide, mr. kapasi?â€
â€œfive years.â€
mrs. das reached the car. â€œhow longâ€™s the trip?â€ she asked, shutting the do

or.
â€œabout two and a half hours,â€ mr. kapasi replied.
at this mrs. das gave an impatient sigh, as ifshe had been traveling her whole life
without pause. she fanned herself with a folded bombay film magazine written in
english.
â€œithought that the sun temple is only eighteen miles north of puri,â€ mr. das said,
tapping on the tour book.
â€œthe roads to konarak are poor. actually it is a distance of fifty-two miles,â€ mr. kapasi
explained.
mr. das nodded, readjusting the camera strap where it had begun to chafe the back of
his neck.
before starting the ignition, mr. kapasi reached back to make sure the cranklike locks
on the inside of each of the back doors were secured. as soon as the car began to
move the little girl began to play with the lock on her side, clicking it with some effort
forward and backward, but mrs. das said nothing to stop her. she sat a bit slouched at
one end of the back seat, not offering her puf

obby said as the car began to gather speed. he pointed with his finger to the
tall trees that lined the road. â€œlook.â€
â€œmonkeys!â€ ronny shrieked. â€œwow!â€
they were seated in groups along the branches, with shining black faces, silver bodies,
horizontal eyebrows, and crested heads. their long gray tails dangled like a series of
ropes among the leaves. a few scratched themselves with black leathery hands, or
swung their feet, staring as the car passed.
â€œwe call them the hanuman,â€ mr. kapasi said. â€œthey are quite common in the area.â€
as soon as he spoke, one of the monkeys leaped into the middle of the road, causing
mr. kapasi to brake suddenly. another bounced onto the hood of the car, then sprang
away. mr. kapasi beeped his horn. the children began to get excited, sucking in their
breath and covering their faces partly with their hands. they had never seen monkeys
outside of a zoo, mr. das explained. he asked mr. kapasi to stop the car so that he
could take a picture.

the car rattled considerably as it raced along the dusty road, causing them all to pop up
from their seats every now and then, but mrs. das continued to polish her nails. mr.
kapasi eased up on the accelerator, hoping to produce a smoother ride. when he
reached for the gearshift the boy in front accommodated him by swinging his hairless
knees out of the way. mr. kapasi noted that this boy was slightly paler than the other
children. â€œdaddy, why is the driver sitting on the wrong side in this car, too?â€ the boy
asked.
â€œthey all do that here, dummy,â€ ronny said.
â€œdonâ€™t call your brother a dummy,â€ mr. das said. he turned to mr. kapasi. â€œin america,
you know â€¦ it confuses them.â€
â€œoh yes, i am well aware,â€ mr. kapasi said. as delicately as he could, he shifted gears
again, accelerating as they approached a hill in the road. â€œisee it on dal

they were all like siblings, mr. kapasi thought as they passed a row of date trees. mr.
and mrs. das behaved like an older brother and sister, not parents. it seemed that they
were in charge of the children only for the day; it was hard to believe they were regularly
responsible for anything other than themselves. mr. das tapped on his lens cap, and his
tour book, dragging his thumbnail occasionally across the pages so that they made a
scraping sound. mrs. das continued to polish her nails. she had still not removed her

â€œitold you to get a car with air-conditioning,â€ mrs. das continued. â€œwhy do you do this,

their accents sounded just like the ones mr. kapasi heard on american television
programs, though not like the ones on dallas.
â€œdoesnâ€™t it get tiresome, mr. kapasi, showing people the same thing every day?â€ mr.
das asked, rolling down his own window all the way. â€œhey, do you mind stopping the
car. i just want to get a shot of this guy.â€
mr. kapasi pulled over to the side of the road as mr. das took a picture of a barefoot
man, his head wrapped in a dirty turban, seated on top of a cart of grain sacks pulled by
a pair of bullocks. both

the man and the bullocks were emaciated. in the back seat mrs.

quickly in front of one another.

fridays and saturdays only. i have another job during the week.â€

â€œyouâ€™re a doctor?â€
â€œi am not a doctor. i work with one. as an interpreter.â€
â€œwhat does a doctor need an interpreter for?â€
â€œhe has a number of gujarati patients. my father was gujarati, but many people do not

his office, interpreting what the patients say.â€
â€œinteresting. iâ€™ve never heard of anything like that,â€ mr. das said.
mr. kapasi shrugged. â€œitis a job like any other.â€
â€œbut so romantic,â€ mrs. das said dreamily, breaking her extended silence. she lifted her
pinkish brown sunglasses and arranged them on top of her head like a tiara. for the first
time, her eyes met mr. kapasiâ€™s in the rearview mirror: pale, a bit small, their gaze fixed
but drowsy.
mr. das craned to look at her. â€œwhatâ€™s so romantic about it?â€
â€œidonâ€™t know. something.â€ she shrugged, knitting her brows together for an instant.
â€œwould you like a piece of gum, mr. kapasi?â€ she asked brightly. she reached into her
straw bag and handed him a small square wrapped in green-and-white-striped paper.
as soon as mr. kapasi put the gum in his mouth a thick sweet liquid burst onto his
tongue.

mustard oil from the corners of her mouth. â€œtellus a typical situation.â€ she settled back
in her seat, her head tilted in a patch of sun, and closed her eyes. â€œiwant to picture

stuck in his throat. when i told the doctor he was able to prescribe the proper
medication.â€
â€œthatâ€™s so neat.â€
â€œyes,â€ mr. kapasi agreed after some hesitation.
â€œso these patients are totally dependent on you,â€ mrs. das said. she spoke slowly, as if
she were thinking aloud. â€œin a way, more dependent on you than the doctor.â€
â€œhow do you mean? how could it be?â€
â€œwell, for example, you could tell the doctor that the pain felt like a burning, not straw.
the patient would never know what you had told the doctor, and the doctor wouldnâ€™t
know that you had told the wrong thing. itâ€™s a big responsibility.â€
â€œye
 
 ___________________________
 
s, a big responsibility you have there, mr. kapasi,â€ mr. das agreed.
mr. kapasi had never thought of his job in such complimentary terms. to him it was a
thankless occupation. he found nothing noble in interpreting peopleâ€™s maladies,
assiduously translating the symptoms of so many swollen bones, countless cramps of
bellies and bowels, spots on peopleâ€™s palms that changed color, shape, or size. the
doctor, nearly half his age, had an affinity for bell-bottom trousers and made humorless
jokes about the congress party. together they worked in a stale little infirmary wher

the job was a sign of his failings. in his youth heâ€™d been a devoted scholar of foreign
languages, the owner of an impressive collection of dictionaries. he had dreamed of
being an interpreter for diplomats and dignitaries, resolving conflicts between people
and nations, settling disputes of which he alone could understand both sides. he was a
self-educated man.

ebooks, in the evenings before his parents settled
his marriage, he had listed the common etymologies of words, and at one point in his
life he was confident that he could converse, if given the opportunity, in english, french,
russian, portuguese, and italian, not to mention hindi, bengali, oriya, and gujarati.
now only a handful of european phrases remained in his memory, scattered words for
things like saucers and chairs. english was the only non-indian language he spoke
fluently anymore. mr. kapasi knew it was not a remarkable talent. sometimes he feared
that his children knew better english than he did, just from watching television. still, it
came in handy for the tours.
he had taken the job as an interpreter after his first son, at the age of seven, contracted
typhoidâ€”that was how he had first made the acquaintance of the doctor. at the time mr.
kapasi had been teaching english in a grammar school, and he bartered his skills as an
interpreter to pay the increasingly exorbitant medica

ls. in the end the boy had died
one evening in his motherâ€™s arms, his limbs burning with fever, but then there was the
funeral to pay for, and the other children who were born soon enough, and the newer,
bigger house, and the good schools and tutors, and the fine shoes and the television,
and the countless other ways he tried to console his wife and to keep her from crying in
her sleep, and so when the doctor offered to pay him twice as much as he earned at the
grammar school, he accepted. mr. kapasi knew that his wife had little regard for his
career as an interpreter. he knew it reminded her of the son sheâ€™d lost, and that she
resented the other lives he helped, in his own small way, to save. if ever she referred to
his position, she used the phrase â€œdoctorâ€™s assistant,â€ as if the process of interpretation
were equal to taking someoneâ€™s temperature, or changing a bedpan. she never asked
him about the patients who came to the doctorâ€™s office, or said that his job was a big

onsibility.
for this reason it flattered mr. kapasi that mrs. das was so intrigued by his job. unlike
his wife, she had reminded him of its intellectual challenges. she had also used the
word â€œromantic.â€ she did not behave in a romantic way toward her husband, and yet
she had used the word to describe him. he wondered if mr. and mrs. das were a bad
match, just as he and his wife were. perhaps they, too, had little in common apart from
three children and a decade of their lives. the signs he recognized from his own
marriage were thereâ€”the b

ickering, the indifference, the protracted silences. her
sudden interest in him, an interest she did not express in either her husband or her
children, was mildly intoxicating. when mr. kapasi thought once again about how she
had said â€œromantic,â€ the feeling of intoxication grew.
he began to check his reflection in the rearview mirror as he drove, feeling grateful that
he had chosen the gray suit that morning and not the brown one, which tended to sag a
little in the knees. from time to time he glanced through the mirror at mrs. das. in
addition to glancing at her face he glanced at the strawberry between her breasts, and
the golden brown hollow in her throat. he decided to tell

as about another patient,
and another: the young woman who had complained of a sensation of raindrops in her
spine, the gentleman whose birthmark had begun to sprout hairs. mrs. das listened
attentively, stroking her hair with a small plastic brush that resembled an oval bed of
nails, asking more questions, for yet another example. the children were quiet, intent
on spotting more monkeys in the trees, and mr. das was absorbed by his tour book, so
it seemed like a private conversation between mr. kapasi and mrs. das. in this manner
the next half hour passed, and when they stopped for lunch at a roadside restaurant
that sold fritters and omelette sandwiches, usually something mr. kapasi looked forward
to on his tours so that he could sit in peace and enjoy some hot tea, he was
disappointed. as the das family settled together under a magenta umbrella fringed with
white and orange tassels, and placed their orders with one of the waiters who marched
about in tricornered caps, mr. kapasi reluctantl

y headed toward a neighboring table.
â€œmr.kapasi, wait. thereâ€™s room here,â€ mrs. das called out. she gathered tina onto her
lap, insisting that he accompany them. and so, together, they had bottled mango juice
and sandwiches and plates of onions and potatoes deep-fried in graham-flour batter.
after finishing two omelette sandwiches mr. das took more pictures of the group as they
ate.
â€œhow much longer?â€ he asked mr. kapasi as he paused to load a new roll of film in the
camera.
â€œabout half an hour more.â€
by now the children had gotten up from the table to look at more monkeys perched in a
nearby tree, so there was a considerable space between mrs. das and mr. kapasi. mr.
das placed the camera to his face and squeezed one eye shut, his tongue exposed at
one corner of his mouth. â€œthis looks funny. mina, you need to lean in closer to mr.
kapasi.â€
she did. he could smell a scent on her skin, like a mixture of

whiskey and rosewater.
he worried suddenly that she could smell his perspiration, which he knew had collected
beneath the synthetic material of his shirt. he polished off his mango juice in one gulp
and smoothed his silver hair with his hands. a bit of the juice dripped onto his chin. he
wondered if mrs. das had noticed.
she had not. â€œwhatâ€™s your address, mr. kapasi?â€ she inquired, fishing for something
inside her straw bag.
â€œyouwould like my address?â€
â€œso we can send you copies,â€ she said. â€œof the pictures.â€ she handed him a scrap of
paper which she had hastily ripped from a page of her film magazine. the blank portion
was limited, for the narrow strip was crowded by lines of text and a tiny picture of a hero
and heroine embracing under a eucalyptus tree.
the paper curled as mr. kapasi wrote his address in clear, careful letters. she would

respond eloquently, choosing only the most entertaining anecdotes, ones that would
make her laugh out loud as she read them in her house in new jersey. in time she
would reveal the disappointment of her marriage, and he his. in this way their friendship
would grow, and flourish. he would possess a picture of the two of them, eating fried
onions under a magenta umbrella, which he would keep, he decided, safely tucked
between the pages of his russian grammar. as his mind raced, mr. kapasi experienced
a mild and pleasant shock. it was similar to a feeling he used to experience long ago
when, after months of translating with the aid of a dictionary, he would finally read a
passage from a french novel, or an italian sonnet, and understand the words, one after
another, unencumbered by his own efforts. in those moments mr. kapasi used to
believe that all was right with the world, that all struggles were rewarded, that all of lifeâ€™s
mistakes made sense in the end. the promise that h

e would hear from mrs. das now
filled him with the same belief.
when he finished writing his address mr. kapasi handed her the paper, but as soon as
he did so he worried that he had either misspelled his name, or accidentally reversed
the numbers of his postal code. he dreaded the possibility of a lost letter, the
photograph never reaching him, hovering somewhere in orissa, close but ultimately
unattainable. he thought of asking for the slip of paper again, just to make sure he had
written his address accurately, but mrs. das had already dropped it into the jumble of
her bag.

thirty. the temple, made of sandstone, was a massive
pyramid-like structure in the shape of a chariot. it was dedicated to the great master of
life, the sun, which struck three sides of the edifice as it made its journey each day
across the sky. twenty-four giant wheels were carved on the north and south sides of
the plinth. the whole thing was drawn by a team of seven horses, speeding as if
through the heavens. as they approached, mr. kapasi explained that the temple had
been built between a.d. 1243 and 1255, with the efforts of twelve hundred artisans, by
the great ruler of the ganga dynasty, king narasimhadeva the first, to commemorate
his victory against the muslim army.
â€œitsays the temple occupies about a hundred and seventy acres of land,â€ mr. das said,
reading from his book.
â€œitâ€™slike a desert,â€ ronny said, his eyes wandering across the sand that stretched on all
sides beyond the temple.

they got out and walked toward the temple, posing first for pictures by the pair of lions
that flanked the steps. mr. kapasi led them next to one of the wheels of the chariot,
higher than any human being, nine feet in diameter.
â€œâ€˜the wheels are supposed to symbolize the wheel of life,â€™â€mr. das read. â€œâ€˜they depict
the cycle of creation, preservation, and achievement of realization.â€™ cool.â€ he turned the
page of his book. â€œâ€˜each wheel is divided into eight thick and thin spokes, dividing the
day into eight equal parts. the rims are carved with designs of birds and animals,

 countless friezes of entwined naked bodies, making love
in various positions, women clinging to the necks of men, their knees wrapped eternally
around their loversâ€™ thighs. in addition to these were assorted scenes from daily life, of
hunting and trading, of deer being killed with bows and arrows and marching warriors
holding swords in their hands.
it was no longer possible to enter the temple, for it had filled with rubble years ago, but
they admired the exterior, as did all the tourists mr. kapasi brought there, slowly
strolling along each of its sides. mr. das trailed behind, taking pictures. the children ran
ahead, pointing to figures of naked people, intrigued in particular by the nagamithunas,
the half-human, half-serpentine couples who were said, mr. kapasi told them, to live in
the deepest waters of the sea. mr. kapasi was pleased that they liked the temple,
pleased especially that it appealed to mrs. das. she stopped every three or four paces,
staring silently at the carved lovers

female musicians beating on two-sided drums.
though mr. kapasi had been to the temple countless times, it occurred to him, as he,
too, gazed at the topless women, that he had never seen his own wife fully naked. even
when they had made love she kept the panels of her blouse hooked together, the string
of her petticoat knotted around her waist. he had never admired the backs of his wifeâ€™s
legs the way he now admired those of mrs. das, walking as if for his benefit alone. he
had, of course, seen plenty of bare limbs before, belonging to the american and

women, who had an interest only in the temple, and kept their noses buried in a
guidebook, or their eyes behind the lens of a camera, mrs. das had taken an interest in
him.
mr. kapasi was anxious to be alone with her, to continue their private conversation, yet
he felt nervous to walk at her side. she was lost behind her sunglasses, ignoring her
husbandâ€™s requests that she pose for another picture, walking past her children as if
they were strangers. worried that he might disturb her, mr. kapasi walked ahead, to
admire, as he always did, the three life-sized bronze avatars of surya, the sun god,
each emerging from its own niche on the temple facade to greet the sun at dawn

, noon,
and evening. they wore elaborate headdresses, their languid, elongated eyes closed,
their bare chests draped with carved chains and amulets. hibiscus petals, offerings from
previous visitors, were strewn at their gray-green feet. the last statue, on the northern
wall of the temple, was mr. kapasiâ€™s favorite. this surya had a tired expression, weary
after a hard day of work, sitting astride a horse with folded legs. even his horseâ€™s eyes
were drowsy. around his body were smaller sculptures of women in pairs, their hips
thrust to one side.
â€œwhoâ€™s that?â€ mrs. das asked. he was startled to see that she was standing beside him.
â€œhe is the astachala-surya,â€ mr. kapasi said. â€œthe setting sun.â€
â€œso in a couple of hours the sun willset right here?â€ she slipped a foot out of

â€œthat is correct.â€
she raised her sunglasses for a moment, then put them back on again. â€œneat.â€
mr. kapasi was not certain exactly what the word suggested, but he had a feeling it was
a favorable response. he hoped that mrs. das had understood suryaâ€™s beauty, his
power. perhaps they would discuss it further in their letters. he would explain things to
her, things about india, and she would explain things to him about america. in its own
way this correspondence would fulfillhis dream, of serving as an interpreter between
nations. he looked at her straw bag, delighted that his address lay nestled am

her, even for an instant, in an embrace witnessed by his favorite surya. but mrs. das
had already started walking.
â€œwhen do you return to america?â€ he asked, trying to sound placid.
â€œin ten days.â€
he calculated: a week to settle in, a week to develop the pictures, a few days to
compose her letter, two weeks to get to india by air. according to his schedule, allowing
room for delays, he would hear from mrs. das in approximately six weeksâ€™ time.
the family was silent as mr. kapasi drove them back, a little past four-thirty, to hotel
sandy villa. the children had bought miniature granite versions of the chariotâ€™s wheels
at a souvenir stand, and they turned them round in their hands. mr. das continued to
read his book. mrs. das untangled tinaâ€™s hair with her brush and divided it into two little
ponytails.
mr. kapasi was beginning to dread the thought of dropping them off. he was not

ing a shortcut,
eager to return home, scrub his feet and hands with sandalwood soap, and enjoy the
evening newspaper and a cup of tea that his wife would serve him in silence. the
thought of that silence, something to which heâ€™d long been resigned, now oppressed
him. it was then that he suggested visiting the hills at udayagiri and khandagiri, where a
number of monastic dwellings were hewn out of the ground, facing one another across
a defile. it was some miles away, but well worth seeing, mr. kapasi told them.
â€œoh yeah, thereâ€™s something mentioned about it in this book,â€ mr. das said. â€œbuiltby a
jain king or something.â€
â€œshall we go then?â€ mr. kapasi asked. he paused at a turn in the road. â€œitâ€™sto the left.â€
mr. das turned to look at mrs. das. both of them shrugged.
â€œleft, left,â€ the children chanted.
mr. kapasi turned the wheel, almost delirious with relief. he did not know what he would
do or say to mrs. das once they arrived at the hills. perhaps he would tell he

s, as well as on the branches of the trees. their hind legs were
stretched out in front and raised to shoulder level, their arms resting on their knees.
â€œmylegs are tired,â€ she said, sinking low in her seat. â€œiâ€™llstay here.â€
â€œwhy did you have to wear those stupid shoes?â€ mr. das said. â€œyouwonâ€™t be in the
pictures.â€
â€œpretend iâ€™m there.â€
â€œbut we could use one of these pictures for our christmas card this year. we didnâ€™t get
one of all five of us at the sun temple. mr. kapasi could take it.â€
â€œiâ€™mnot coming. anyway, those monkeys give me the creeps.â€
â€œbut theyâ€™re harmless,â€ mr. das said. he turned to mr. kapasi. â€œarenâ€™t they?â€
â€œthey are more hungry than dangerous,â€ mr. kapasi said. â€œdo not provoke them with
food, and they willnot bother you.â€
mr. das headed up the defile with the children, the boys at his side, the little girl on his
shoulders. mr. kapasi watched as they crossed paths with a japanese man and
woman, the only other tourists

ay. as the car disappeared out of view some of the
monkeys called out, emitting soft whooping sounds, and then walked on their flat black
hands and feet up the path. at one point a group of them formed a little ring around mr.
das and the children. tina screamed in delight. ronny ran in circles around his father.
bobby bent down and picked up a fat stick on the ground. when he extended it, one of
the monkeys approached him and snatched it, then briefly beat the ground.
â€œiâ€™lljoin them,â€ mr. kapasi said, unlocking the door on his side. â€œthere is much to
explain about the caves.â€
â€œno. stay a minute,â€ mrs. das said. she got out of the back seat and slipped in beside
mr. kapasi. â€œraj has his dumb book anyway.â€ together, through the windshield, mrs.
das and mr. kapasi watched as bobby and the monkey passed the stick back and forth
between them.
â€œabrave little boy,â€ mr. kapasi commented.
â€œitâ€™snot so surprising,â€ mrs. das said.
â€œno?â€
â€œheâ€™s not his.â€
â€œibeg your

pardon?â€
â€œrajâ€™s. heâ€™s not rajâ€™s son.â€
mr. kapasi felt a prickle on his skin. he reached into his shirt pocket for the small tin of
lotus-oil balm he carried with him at all times, and applied it to three spots on his
forehead. he knew that mrs. das was watching him, but he did not turn to face her.
instead he watched as the figures of mr. das and the children grew smaller, climbing up
the steep path, pausing every now and then for a picture, surrounded by a growing
number of monkeys.
â€œare you surprised?â€ the way she put it made him choose

 his words with care.
â€œitâ€™snot the type of thing one assumes,â€ mr. kapasi replied slowly. he put the tin of
lotus-oil balm back in his pocket.
â€œno, of course not. and no one knows, of course. no one at all. iâ€™ve kept it a secret for
eight whole years.â€ she looked at mr. kapasi, tilting her chin as if to gain a fresh
perspective. â€œbut now iâ€™ve told you.â€
mr. kapasi nodded. he felt suddenly parched, and his forehead was warm and slightly
numb from the balm. he considered asking mrs. das for a sip of water, then decided
against it.
â€œwe met when we were very young,â€ she said. she reached into her straw bag in
search of something, then pulled out a packet of puffed rice. â€œwant some?â€
â€œno, thank you.â€
she put a fistful in her mouth, sank into the seat a little, and looked away from mr.
kapasi, out the window on her side of the car. â€œwe married wh

ght of being separated, not for a day, not
for a minute. our parents were best friends who lived in the same town. my entire life i

together while our parents joked about our marriage. imagine! they never caught us at
anything, though in a way i think it was all more or less a setup. the things we did those
friday and saturday nights, while our parents sat downstairs drinking tea â€¦ i could tell
you stories, mr. kapasi.â€
as a result of spending all her time in college with raj, she continued, she did not make
many close friends. there was no one to confide in about him at the end of a difficult
day, or to share a passing thought or a worry. her parents now lived on the other side of
the world, but she had never been very close to them, anyway. after marrying so young
she was overwhelmed by it all, having a child so quickly, and nursing, and warming up
bottles of milk and testing their temperature against he

 an expertise she had
never known, without the meaningful expressions and smiles raj always insisted on
afterward. the next day raj drove the friend to jfk. he was married now, to a punjabi
girl, and they lived in london still, and every year they exchanged christmas cards with
raj and mina, each couple tucking photos of their families into the envelopes. he did
not know that he was bobbyâ€™s father. he never would.
â€œibeg your pardon, mrs. das, but why have you told me this information?â€ mr. kapasi
asked when she had finally finished speaking, and had turned to face him once again.
â€œfor godâ€™s sake, stop calling me mrs. das. iâ€™m twenty-eight. you probably have children
my age.â€
â€œnot quite.â€ it disturbed mr. kapasi to learn that she thought of him as a parent. the
feeling he had had toward her, that had made him check his reflection in the rearview
mirror as they drove, evaporated a little.
â€œitold you because of your talents.â€ she put the packet of puffed rice back into her

without folding over the top.
â€œidonâ€™t understand,â€ mr. kapasi said.
â€œdonâ€™t you see? for eight years i havenâ€™t been able to express this to anybody, not to
friends, certainly not to raj. he doesnâ€™t even suspect it. he thinks iâ€™m still in love with
him. well, donâ€™t you have anything to say?â€
â€œabout what?â€
â€œabout what iâ€™ve just told you. about my secret, and about how terrible it makes me feel.
i feel terrible looking at my children, and at raj, always terrible. i have terrible urges, mr.
kapasi, to throw things away. one day i had the

â€œmr.kapasi, donâ€™t you have anything to say? i thought that was your job.â€
â€œmyjob is to give tours, mrs. das.â€
â€œnot that. your other job. as an interpreter.â€
â€œbut we do not face a language barrier. what need is there for an interpreter?â€
â€œthatâ€™s not what i mean. i would never have told you otherwise. donâ€™t you realize what it
means for me to tell you?â€
â€œwhat does it mean?â€
â€œitmeans that iâ€™m tired of feeling so terrible all the time. eight years, mr. kapasi, iâ€™ve

he looked at her, in her red plaid skirt and strawberry t-shirt, a woman not yet thirty,
who loved neither her husband nor her children, who had already fallen out of love with
life. her confession depressed him, depressed him all the more when he thought of mr.
das at the top of the path, tina clinging to his shoulders, taking pictures of ancient
monastic cells cut

 into the hills to show his students in america, unsuspecting and
unaware that one of his sons was not his own. mr. kapasi felt insulted that mrs. das
should ask him to interpret her common, trivial little secret. she did not resemble the
patients in the doctorâ€™s office, those who came glassy-eyed and desperate, unable to
sleep or breathe or urinate with ease, unable, above all, to give words to their pains.
still, mr. kapasi believed it was his duty to assist mrs. das. perhaps he ought to tell her
to confess the truth to mr. das. he would explain that honesty was the best policy.
honesty, surely, would help her feel better, as sheâ€™d put it. perhaps he would offer to
preside over the discussion, as a mediator. he decided to begin with the most obvious
question, to get to the heart of the matter, and so he asked, â€œis it really pain you feel,
mrs. das, or is it guilt?â€
she turned to him and glared, mustard oil t

hick on her frosty pink lips. she opened her
mouth to say something, but as she glared at mr. kapasi some certain knowledge
seemed to pass before her eyes, and she stopped. it crushed him; he knew at that
moment that he was not even important enough to be properly insulted. she opened the
car door and began walking up the path, wobbling a little on her square wooden heels,
reaching into her straw bag to eat handfuls of puffed rice. it fell through her fingers,
leaving a zigzagging trail, causing a monkey to leap down from a tree and devour the
little white grains. in search of more, the monkey

 began to follow mrs. das. others
joined him, so that she was soon being followed by about half a dozen of them, their
velvety tails dragging behind.
mr. kapasi stepped out of the car. he wanted to holler, to alert her in some way, but he
worried that ifshe knew they were behind her, she would grow nervous. perhaps she
would lose her balance. perhaps they would pull at her bag or her hair. he began to jog
up the path, taking a fallen branch in his hand to scare away the monkeys. mrs. das
continued walking, oblivious, trailing grains of puffed rice. near the top of the incline,
before a group of cells fronted by a row of squat stone pillars, mr. das was

 kneeling on
the ground, focusing the lens of his camera. the children stood under the arcade, now
hiding, now emerging from view.
â€œwait for me,â€ mrs. das called out. â€œiâ€™mcoming.â€
tina jumped up and down. â€œhere comes mommy!â€
â€œgreat,â€ mr. das said without looking up. â€œjust in time. weâ€™ll get mr. kapasi to take a
picture of the five of us.â€
mr. kapasi quickened his pace, waving his branch so that the monkeys scampered
away, distracted, in another direction.
â€œwhereâ€™s bobby?â€ mrs. das asked when she stopped.
mr. das looked up from the camera. â€œidonâ€™t know. ronny, whereâ€™s bobby?â€
ronny shrugged. â€œithought he was right here.â€
â€œwhere is he?â€ mrs. das repeated sharply. â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with all of you?â€
they began calling his name, wandering up and down the path a bit. because they
were calling, they did not initially hear

 earlier.
â€œdaddy, the monkeyâ€™s hurting bobby,â€ tina said.
mr. das wiped his palms on the front of his shorts. in his nervousness he accidentally
pressed the shutter on his camera; the whirring noise of the advancing film excited the
monkeys, and the one with the stick began to beat bobby more intently. â€œwhat are we
supposed to do? what if they start attacking?â€
â€œmr.kapasi,â€ mrs. das shrieked, noticing him standing to one side. â€œdo something, for
godâ€™s sake, do something!â€
mr. kapasi took his branch and shooed them away, hissing at the ones that remained,
stomping his feet to scare them. the animals retreated slowly, with a measured gait,
obedient but unintimidated. mr. kapasi gathered bobby in his arms and brought him
back to where his parents and siblings were standing. as he carried him he was
tempted to whisper a secret into the boyâ€™s ear. but bobby was stunned, and shivering
with fright, his legs bleeding slightly where the stick had broken the skin. when mr.
kapasi

of his head.
â€œgod, letâ€™s get out of here,â€ mrs. das said. she folded her arms across the strawberry
on her chest. â€œthis place gives me the creeps.â€
â€œyeah. back to the hotel, definitely,â€ mr. das agreed.
â€œpoor bobby, â€ mrs. das said. â€œcome here a second. let mommy fix your hair.â€ again
she reached into her straw bag, this time for her hairbrush, and began to run it around
the edges of the translucent visor. when she whipped out the hairbrush, the slip of
paper with mr. kapasiâ€™s address on it fluttered away in the wind. no one but mr. kapasi
noticed. he watched as it rose, carried higher and higher by the breeze, into the trees
where the monkeys now sat, solemnly observing the scene below. mr. kapasi observed
it too, knowing that this was the picture of the das family he would preserve forever in
his mind.
