Mencius - 
                	A
Chinese sage of the fourth century B.C. and
a disciple of Confucius. Mencius was best known for his anthology
of sayings and stories collected under the title The Book
of Mencius, and did much to promote the reputation of Confucius,
although he himself was not widely venerated until more than a thousand
years later. Like his master's work, Mencius's combination of respect
for social harmony and the inward reconciliation with the universe
exerted a powerful influence on Thoreau.
