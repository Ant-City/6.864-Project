her almost screamed, "i know you're a good man. you don't look a bit like you have com- mon blood. i know you must come from nice people!"

"yes mam," he said, "finest people in the world." when he smiled he showed a row of strong white teeth. "god never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy's heart was pure gold," he said. the boy with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was standing with his gun at his hip. the misfit squatted down on the ground. "watch them children, bobby lee," he said. "you know they make me nervous." he looked at the six of them huddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn't think of anything to say. "ain't a cloud in the sky," he remarked, looking up at it. "don't see no sun but don't see no cloud neither."

"yes, it's a beautiful day," said the grandmother. "listen," she said, "you shouldn't call yourself the misfit because i know you're a good man at heart. i can just look at you and tell "

lled. "hush! everybody shut up and let me handle this!" he was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn't move.

"i prechate that, lady," the misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.

"it'll take a half a hour to fix this here car," hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.

"well, first you and bobby lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you," the misfit said, pointing to bailey and john wesley. "the boys want to ast you some- thing," he said to bailey. "would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?"

"listen," bailey began, "we're in a terrible predicament! nobody realizes what this is," and his voice cracked. his eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained perfectly still.

the grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if s

he were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. she stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on the ground. hiram pulled bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. john wesley caught hold of his father's hand and bobby lee followed. they went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, "i'll be back in a minute, mamma, wait on me!"

"come back this instant!" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.

"bailey boy!" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at the misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. "i just know you're a good man," she said desperately. "you'

"if you would pray," the old lady said, "jesus would help you."

"that's right," the misfit said.

"well then, why don't you pray?" she asked trembling with delight suddenly.

"i don't want no hep," he said. "i'm doing all right by myself."

bobby lee and hiram came ambling back from the woods. bobby lee was dragging a yellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it.

"thow me that shirt, bobby lee," the misfit said. the shirt came flying at him and landed on his shoulder and he put it on. the grandmother couldn't name what the shirt reminded her of. "no, lady," the misfit said while he was buttoning it up, "i found out the crime don't matter. you can do one thing or you can do another, kill a man or take a tire off his car, because sooner or la

the children's mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn't get her breath. "lady," he asked, "would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with bobby lee and hiram and join your husband?"

"yes, thank you," the mother said faintly. her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. "hep that lady up, hiram," the misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, "and bobby lee, you hold onto that little girl's hand."

"i don't want to hold hands with him," june star said. "he reminds me of a pig."

the fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods afte

 like i am now." his voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother's head cleared for an instant. she saw the man's face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured, "why you're one of my babies. you're one of my own children!" she reached out and touched him on the shoulder. the misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. then he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to clean them.

hiram and bobby lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down at the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under her like a child's and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky.

without his glasses, the misfit's eyes were red-rimmed and pale and defenseless-looking. "take her off and thow her where you shown the others," he said, picking up the cat that was rubbing itself against his leg.

"she was a talker, wasn't she

?" bobby lee said, sliding down the ditch with a yodel.

"she would of been a good woman," the misfit said, "if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life."

"some fun!" bobby lee said.

"shut up, bobby lee" the misfit said. "it's no real pleasure in life."
