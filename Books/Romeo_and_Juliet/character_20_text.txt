  chor. two households, both alike in dignity,
    in fair verona, where we lay our scene,
    from ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    a pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
    doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
    the fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    and the continuance of their parents' rage,

the only son of your great enemy.

  jul. my only love, sprung from my only hate!
    too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    prodigious birth of love it is to me
    that i must love a loathed enemy.

  nurse. what's this? what's this?

  jul. a rhyme i learnt even now
    of one i danc'd withal.
                                     one calls within, 'juliet.'

  nurse. anon, anon!
    come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        exeunt.




prologue

enter chorus.


  chor. now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
    and young affection gapes to be his heir;
    that fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    with tender juliet match'd, is now not fair.
    now romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
    alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
    but to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
    and she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
    being held a foe, he may not have access
    to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
