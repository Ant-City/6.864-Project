something—just boom, then down—not  like  the  movies  where  the  dead
guy  rolls  around  and  does  fancy  spins  and  goes  ass  over  teakettle—not
like  that,  kiowa  said,  the  poor  bastard  just  flat-fuck  fell.  boom.  down.
nothing else. it was a bright morning in mid-april. lieutenant cross felt
the pain. he blamed himself. they stripped off lavender's canteens and
ammo,  all  the  heavy  things,  and  rat  kiley  said  the  obvious,  the  guy's
dead, and mitchell sanders used his radio to report one u.s. kia and to
request  a  chopper.  then  they  wrapped  lavender  in  his  poncho.  they



carried him out to a dry paddy, established security, and sat smoking the
dead  man's  dope  until  the  chopper  came.  lieutenant  cross  kept  to
himself. he pictured martha's smooth young face, thinking he loved her
more  than  anything,  more  than  his  men,  and  now  ted  lavender  was
dead  because  he  loved  her  so  much  and  could  not  stop  thinking  about

out  matters  of
security. he was beyond that. he was just a kid at war, in love. he was
twenty-four years old. he couldn't help it.

a  few  moments  later  lee  strunk  crawled  out  of  the  tunnel.  he  came
up grinning, filthy but alive. lieutenant cross nodded and closed his eyes
while the others clapped strunk on the back and made jokes about rising
from the dead.

worms, rat kiley said. right out of the grave. fuckin' zombie.
the men laughed. they all felt great relief.
spook city, said mitchell sanders.
lee  strunk  made  a  funny  ghost  sound,  a  kind  of  moaning,  yet  very
happy,  and  right  then,  when  strunk  made  that  high  happy  moaning

head on his way back from peeing. he lay with his mouth open. the teeth
were broken. there was a swollen black bruise under his left eye.

the cheekbone was gone. oh shit, rat kiley said, the guy's dead. the
guy's  dead,  he  kept  saying,  which  seemed  profound—the  g

at  had  been  presented  to  him  as  a  gift  by  mitchell
sanders. the thumb was dark brown, rubbery to the touch, and weighed
4 ounces at most. it had been cut from a vc corpse, a boy of fifteen or
sixteen.  they'd  found  him  at  the  bottom  of  an  irrigation  ditch,  badly
burned,  flies  in  his  mouth  and  eyes.  the  boy  wore  black  shorts  and
sandals. at the time of his death he had been carrying a pouch of rice, a
rifle, and three magazines of ammunition.

you want my opinion, mitchell sanders said, there's a definite moral

here.

he put his hand on the dead boy's wrist. he was quiet for a time, as if
counting a pulse, then he patted the stomach, almost affectionately, and
used kiowa's hunting hatchet to remove the thumb.

henry dobbins asked what the moral was.
moral?
you know. moral.
sanders  wrapped  the  thumb  in  toilet  paper  and  handed  it  across  to
norman bowker. there was no blood. smiling, he kicked the boy's head,
watched  the  flies  scatter,  and  said,  it's  like

their  lines  mostly  memorized,  irony  mixed  with  tragedy,  and  because
they  called  it  by  other  names,  as  if  to  encyst  and  destroy  the  reality  of
death itself. they kicked corpses. they cut off thumbs. they talked grunt
lingo.  they  told  stories  about  ted  lavender's  supply  of  tranquilizers,
how the poor guy didn't feel a thing, how incredibly tranquil he was.

there's a moral here, said mitchell sanders.
they  were  waiting  for  lavender's  chopper,  smoking  the  dead  man's

dope.

the moral's pretty obvious, sanders said, and winked. stay away from

drugs. no joke, they'll ruin your day every time.

many years after the war jimmy cross came to visit me at my home in
massachusetts, and for a full day we drank coffee and smoked cigarettes
and  talked  about  everything  we  had  seen  and  done  so  long  ago,  all  the
things  we  still  carried  through  our  lives.  spread  out  across  the  kitchen
table were maybe a hundred old photographs. there were pictures of rat
kiley and kiowa and mitchell sanders, all of us, the faces incredibly soft
and young. at one point, i remember, we paused over a snapshot of ted
lavender, and after a while jimmy rubbed his eyes and said he'd never
forgiven himself for lavender's death. it was something that would never
go away, he said quietly, and i nodded and told him i felt the same about
certain things. then for a long time neither of us could think of much to
say. the thing to do, we decided, was to forget the coffee and switch to
gin,  which  improved  the

new angles. but then one day he rejoins his unit in the bush. can't wait to
get back into action. finally one of his buddies asks what happened with
the nurse, why so hot for combat, and the guy says, "all that peace, man,

i remember mitchell sanders smiling as he told me that story. most of
it  he  made  up,  i'm  sure,  but  even  so  it  gave  me  a  quick  truth-goose.
because it's all relative. you're pinned down in some filthy hellhole of a
paddy,  getting  your  ass  delivered  to  kingdom  come,  but  then  for  a  few
seconds everything goes quiet and you look up and see the sun and a few
puffy  white  clouds,  and  the  immense  serenity  flashes  against  your
eyeballs—the  whole  world  gets  rearranged—and  even  though  yo

were  tiny  white  blossoms,  but  no  sunlight  at  all,  and  i  remember  the
shadows spreading out under the trees where curt lemon and rat kiley
were  playing  catch  with  smoke  grenades.  mitchell  sanders  sat  flipping
his yo-yo. norman bowker and kiowa and dave jensen were dozing, or
half dozing, and all around us were those ragged green mountains.

except for the laughter things were quiet.
at one point, i remember, mitchell sanders turned and looked at me,
not  quite  nodding,  as  if  to  warn  me  about  something,  as  if  he  already
knew, then after a while he rolled up his yo-yo and moved away.

it's hard to tell you what happened next.
they  were  just  goofing.  there  was  a  noise,  i  suppose,  which  must've
been  the  detonator,  so  i  glanced  behind  me  and  watched  lemon  step

hard and exact truth as it seemed.


in many cases a true war story cannot be believed. if you believe it, be
skeptical.  it's  a  question  of  credibility.  often  the  crazy  stuff  is  true  and
the normal stuff isn't, because the normal stuff is necessary to make you
believe the truly incredible craziness.



in other cases you can't even tell a true war story. sometimes it's just

beyond telling.

i heard this one, for example, from mitchell sanders. it was near dusk
and  we  were  sitting  at  my  foxhole  along  a  wide  muddy  river  north  of
quang ngai. i remember how peaceful the twilight was. a deep pinkish
red  spilled  out  on  the  river,  which  moved  without  sound,  and  in  the
morning  we  would  cross  the  river  and  march  west  into  the  mountains.
the occasion was right for a good story.

"god's  truth,"  mitchell  sanders  said.  "a  six-man  patrol  goes  up  into
the mountains on a basic listening-post operation.

funny like, sort of amazed, and the whole war is right there in that stare.
it  says  everything  you  can't  ever  say.  it  says,  man,  you  got  wax  in  your
ears.  it  says,  poor  bastard,  you'll  never  know—wrong  frequency—you
don't even want to hear this. then they salute the fucker and walk away,
because certain stories you don't ever tell."




you  can  tell  a  true  war  story  by  the  way  it  never  seems  to  end.  not
then, not ever. not when mitchell sanders stood up and moved off into
the dark.

it all happened.
even now, at this instant, i remember that yo-yo. in a way, i suppose,
you had to be there, you had to hear it, but i could tell how desperately
sanders wanted me to believe him, his frustration at not quite getting the
details right, not quite pinning down the final and definitive truth.

and  i  remember  sitting  at  my  foxhole  that  night,  watching  the
shadows  of  quang  ngai,  thinking  about  the  coming  day  and  how  we

late in the night mitchell sanders touched my shoulder. "just came to
me,"  he  whispered.  "the  moral,  i  mean.  nobody  listens.  nobody  hears
nothin'.  like  that  fatass  colonel.  the  politicians,  all  the  civilian  types.
your  girlfriend.  my  girlfriend.  everybody's  sweet  little  virgin  girlfriend.
what they need is to go out on lp. the vapors, man. trees and rocks—
you got to listen to your enemy."


and then again, in the morning, sanders came up to me. the platoon
was preparing to move out, checking weapon

rifle and went off by himself.

the rest of us stood in a ragged circle around the baby buffalo. for a
time  no  one  spoke.  we  had  witnessed  something  essential,  something
brand-new and profound, a piece of the world so startling there was not
yet a name for it.

somebody kicked the baby buffalo.
it was still alive, though just barely, just in the eyes.
"amazing,"  dave  jensen  said.  "my  whole  life,  i  never  seen  anything

like it."

"never?"
"not hardly. not once."
kiowa and mitchell sanders picked up the baby buffalo. they hauled it

across the open square, hoisted it up, and dumped it in the village well.

afterward, we sat waiting for rat to get himself together.
"amazing," dave jensen kept saying. "a new wrinkle. i never seen it

before."



mitchell  sanders  took  out  his  yo-yo.  "well,  that's  nam,"  he  said.

"garden of evil. over here, man, every sin's real fresh and original."


how do you generalize?
war  is  hell,  but  that's  not  the  half  of  it,  because  war

be lost. at the hour of dusk you sit at your foxhole and look out on a wide
river turning pinkish red, and at the mountains beyond, and although in
the morning you must cross the river and go into the mountains and do
terrible things and maybe die, even so, you find yourself studying the fine
colors on the river, you feel wonder and awe at the setting of the sun, and
you  are  filled  with  a  hard,  aching  love  for  how  the  world  could  be  and
always should be, but now is not.

mitchell sanders was right. for the common soldier, at least, war has
the  feel—the  spiritual  texture—of  a  great  ghostly  fog,  thick  and
permanent.  there  is  no  clarity.  everything  swirls.  the  old  rules  are  no
longer  binding,  the  old  truths  no  longer  true.  right  spills  over  into
wrong. order blends into chaos, love into hate, ugliness into beauty, law
into anarchy, civility into savagery. the vapors suck you in. you can't tell
where  you  are,  or  why  you're  there,  and  the

 he felt. for rat kiley, i think, facts were
formed by sensation, not the other way around, and when you listened to
one  of  his  stories,  you'd  find  yourself  performing  rapid  calculations  in
your  head,  subtracting  superlatives,  figuring  the  square  root  of  an
absolute and then multiplying by maybe.

still, with this particular story, rat never backed down. he claimed to
have  witnessed  the  incident  with  his  own  eyes,  and  i  remember  how
upset he became one morning when mitchell sanders challenged him on
its basic premise.

"it can't happen," sanders said. "nobody ships his honey over to nam.
it  don't  ring  true.  i  mean,  you  just  can't  import  your  own  personal
poontang."

rat shook his head. "i saw it, man. i was right there. this guy did it."



"his girlfriend?"
"straight on. it's a fact." rat's voice squeaked a little. he paused and
looked at his hands. "listen, the guy sends her the money. flies her over.

the  boonies.  i  swear  to  god,  man,  she's  got  on  culottes.  white  culottes
and this sexy pink sweater. there she is."

i remember mitchell sanders folding his arms. he looked over at me
for a second, not quite grinning, not saying a word, but i could read the
amusement in his eyes.

rat saw it, too.
"no lie," he muttered. "culottes."



when he first arrived in-country, before joining alpha company, rat
had  been  assigned  to  a  small  medical  detachment  up  in  the  mountains
west  of  chu  lai,  near  the  village  of  tra  bong,  where  along  with  eight
other enlisted men he ran an aid station that provided basic emergency

though, but a bright glowing jungle green. she did not pause at fossie's
bunker. she cradled her weapon and moved swiftly to the special forces
hootch and followed the others inside.

briefly,  a  light  came  on,  and  someone  laughed,  then  the  place  went

dark again.


whenever he told the story, rat had a tendency to stop now and then,
interrupting the flow, inserting little clarifications or bits of analysis and
personal opinion. it was a bad habit, mitchell sanders said, because all
that matters is the raw material, the stuff itself, and you can't clutter it up
with  your  own  half-baked  commentary.  that  just  breaks  the  spell.  it
destroys the magic. what you have to do, sanders said, is trust your own
story. get the hell out of the way and let it tell itself.

but rat kiley couldn't help it. he wanted to bracket the full range of

meaning.

"i know it sounds far-out," he'd tell us, "but it's not like impossible or
anything. we all heard plenty of

"man, you must be deaf. she's already gone."



rat kiley stopped there, almost in midsentence, which drove mitchell

sanders crazy.

"what next?" he said.
"next?"
"the girl. what happened to her?"
rat  made  a  small,  tired  motion  with  his  shoulders.  "hard  to  tell  for
sure.  maybe  three,  four  days  later  i  got  orders  to  report  here  to  alpha
company. jumped the first chopper out, that's the last i ever seen of the
place. mary anne, too."

mitchell sanders stared at him.
"you can't do that."
"do what?"
"jesus christ, it's against the rules," sanders said.
"against  human  nature.  this  elaborate  story,  you  can't  say,  hey,  by

the way, i don't know the ending. i mean, you got certain obligations."



rat gave a quick smile. "patience, man. up to now, everything i told
you is from personal experience, the exact truth, but there's a few other
things i heard secondhand. thirdhand, actually. from here on it gets to
be ... i don't know what the

his eyes.

"you know," he said abruptly, "i loved her."
"say again?"
"a lot. we all did, i guess. the way she looked, mary anne made you
think about those girls back home, how clean and innocent they all are,
how they'll never understand any of this, not in a billion years. try to tell
them about it, they'll just stare at you with those big round candy eyes.
they  won't  understand  zip.  it's  like  trying  to  tell  somebody  what
chocolate tastes like."

mitchell sanders nodded. "or shit."
"there  it  is,  you  got  to  taste  it,  and  that's  the  thing  with  mary  anne.
she  was  there.  she  was  up  to  her  eyeballs  in  it.  after  the  war,  man,  i
promise you, you won't find nobody like her."

suddenly, rat pushed up to his feet, moved a few steps away from us,

then stopped and stood with his back turned. he was an emotional guy.

"got  hooked,  i  guess,"  he  said.  "i  loved  her.  so  when  i  heard  from

he  felt  some  pity  come  on  him.  for  a  moment  the  day  seemed  to
soften. so much hurt, he thought. he watched the young soldier wading
through  the  water,  bending  down  and  then  standing  and  then  bending
down again, as if something might finally be salvaged from all the waste.

jimmy cross silently wished the boy luck.
then  he  closed  his  eyes  and  went  back  to  working  on  the  letter  to

kiowa's father.




across the field azar and norman bowker and mitchell sanders were
wading alongside a narrow dike at the edge of the field. it was near noon
now.

norman  bowker  found  kiowa.  he  was  under  two  feet  of  water.

nothing showed except the heel of a boot.

"that's him?" azar said.
"who else?"
"i don't know." azar shook his head. "i don't know."
norman  bowker  touched  the  boot,  covered  his  eyes  for  a  moment,

then stood up and looked at azar.
"so where's the joke?" he said.
"no joke."
"eating shit. let's hear that one."
"forget it."

old  tight.  the  rain  had  come  back
harder  now.  mitchell  sanders  reached  down  and  found  kiowa's  other
boot, and they waited a moment, then sanders sighed and said, "okay,"
and they took hold of the two boots and pulled up hard. there was only a
slight give. they tried again, but this time the body did not move at all.
after the third try they stopped and looked down for a while. "one more
time," norman bowker said. he counted to three and they leaned back
and pulled.

"stuck," said mitchell sanders.
"i see that. christ."
they tried again, then called over henry dobbins and rat kiley, and
all  five  of  them  put  their  arms  and  backs  into  it,  but  the  body  was
jammed in tight.

azar moved to the dike and sat holding his stomach. his face was pale.
the  others  stood  in  a  circle,  watching  the  water,  then  after  a  time
somebody said, "we can't just leave him there," and the men nodded and
got  out  their  entrenching  tools  and  began  digging.  it  was  hard,  sloppy

"what we should do, i guess," norman bowker said, "is tell the lt."
mitchell  sanders  shook  his  head.  "just  mess  things  up.  besides,  the

man looks happy out there, real content. let him be."

after  ten  minutes  they  uncovered  most  of  kiowa's  lower  body.  the
corpse was angled steeply into the muck, upside down, like a diver who
had plunged headfirst off a high tower. the men stood quietly for a few
seconds. there was a feeling of awe. mitchell sanders finally nodded and
said,  "let's  get  it  done,"  and  they  took  hold  of  the  legs  and  pulled  up
hard, then pulled again, and after a moment kiowa came sliding to the
surface. a piece of his shoulder was missing; the arms and chest and face
were  cut  up  with  shrapnel.  he  was  covered  with  bluish  green  mud.
"well," henry dobbins said, "it could be worse," and dave jensen said,
"how, man? tell me how." carefully, trying not to look at the body, they
carried kiowa over to the dike

recognized the soft,
fat feel of the bottom. the water here was eight inches deep.

kathleen  seemed  nervous.  she  squinted  at  me,  her  hands  fluttering.
"listen, this is stupid," she said, "you can't even hardly get wet. how can
you swim out there?"

"i'll manage."
"but  it's  not  ...  i  mean,  god,  it's  not  even  water,  it's  like  mush  or

something."

she  pinched  her  nose  and  watched  me  wade  out  to  where  the  water
reached my knees. roughly here, i decided, was where mitchell sanders
had found kiowa's rucksack. i eased myself down, squatting at first, then
sitting.  there  was  again  that  sense  of  recognition.  the  water  rose  to
midchest, a deep greenish brown, almost hot. small water bugs skipped
along  the  surface.  right  here,  i  thought.  leaning  forward,  i  reached  in
with the moccasins and wedged them into the soft bottom, letting them
slide  away.  tiny  bubbles  broke  along  the  surface.  i  tried  to  think  of
something  decent  to  say,  something

passion  that  my  friend  kiowa  had  once  believed  in  jesus  christ,  or  the

"maybe polio."
"no way," said dobbins. "not polio."
"well, hey," bowker said, "i'm just saying what jorgenson says. maybe
fuckin'  polio.  or  that  weird  elephant  disease.  elephantiasshole  or
whatever."

"yeah, but not polio."
across the hootch, sitting off by himself, azar grinned and snapped his
fingers.  "either  way,"  he  said,  "it  goes  to  show  you.  don't  throw  away
luck on little stuff. save it up."

"there it is," said mitchell sanders.
"morty was due," dave jensen said.
"overdue," sanders said.
norman bowker nodded solemnly. "you don't mess around like that.

you just don't fritter away all your luck."

"amen," said sanders.
"fuckin' polio," said henry dobbins.
we sat quietly for a time. there was no need to talk, because we were
thinking the same things: about morty phillips and the way luck worked
and didn't work and how it was impossible to calculate the odds. there
were  a  million  ways  to  die.  getting  shot  was  on

the others weren't quite so funny.

during the first full day of alpha's stand-down, i didn't run into bobby
jorgenson  once.  not  at  chow,  not  at  the  em  club,  not  even  during  our
long booze sessions in the alpha company hootch. at one point i almost
went looking for him, but my friend mitchell sanders told me to forget it.
"let it ride," he said. "the kid messed up bad, for sure, but you have to
take  into  account  how  green  he  was.  brand-new,  remember?  thing  is,
he's  doing  a  lot  better  now.  i  mean,  listen,  the  guy  knows  his  shit.  say
what you want, but he kept morty phillips alive."

"and that makes it okay?"
sanders  shrugged.  "people  change.  situations  change.  i  hate  to  say

it was anger, partly, but it was also a
sense  of  pure  and  total  loss:  i  didn't  fit  anymore.  they  were  soldiers,  i
wasn't. in a few days they'd saddle up and head back into the bush, and
i'd  stand  up  on  the  helipad  to  watch  them  march  away,  and  then  after
they were gone i'd spend the day loading resupply choppers until it was
time  to  catch  a  movie  or  play  cards  or  drink  myself  to  sleep.  a  funny
thing, but i felt betrayed.

for a long while i just stared at mitchell sanders.
"loyalty," i said. "such a pal."



in the morning i ran into bobby jorgenson. i was loading hueys up on
the helipad, and when the last bird took off, while i was putting on my
shirt, i looked over and saw him leaning against my jeep, waiting for me.



it was a surprise. he seemed smaller than i remembered, a little squirrel
of a guy, short and stumpy-looking.

he nodded nervously.
"well," he said.
at  first  i  just  looked  down  at  his  boots.  those  boots:  i  remembered
them from when

i  thought,  and  i  tried  to  tell  him  that,  but  my  tongue
wouldn't make the connection. i wanted to yell, "you jerk, it's shock—i'm
dying" but all i could do was whinny and squeal. i remembered that, and
the hospital, and the nurses. i even remembered the rage. but i couldn't
feel  it  anymore.  in  the  end,  all  i  felt  was  that  coldness  down  inside  my
chest.  number  one:  the  guy  had  almost  killed  me.  number  two:  there
had to be consequences.

that afternoon i asked mitchell sanders to give me a hand.
"no  pain,"  i  said.  "basic  psychology,  that's  all.  mess  with  his  head  a

little."

"negative," sanders said.



"spook the fucker."
sanders shook his head. "man, you're sick."
"all i want is—"
"sick."
quietly, sanders looked at me for a second and then walked away.
i had to get azar in on it.
he  didn't  have  mitchell  sanders's  intelligence,  but  he  had  a  keener
sense  of  justice.  after  i  explained  the  plan,  azar  gave  me  a  long  white
smile.

could pass through barbed wire and melt away like ice and creep up
on you without sound or footsteps. he was scary. in the daylight, maybe,
you didn't believe in this stuff. you laughed it off. you made jokes. but at
night you turned into a believer: no skeptics in foxholes.



azar  was  wound  up  tight.  all  afternoon,  while  we  made  the
preparations, he kept chanting, "halloween, halloween." that, plus the
finger snapping, almost made me cancel the whole operation. i went hot
and cold. mitchell sanders wouldn't speak to me, which tended to cool it
off,  but  then  i'd  start  remembering  things.  the  result  was  a  kind  of
numbness. no ice, no heat. i just went through the motions, rigidly, by
the numbers, without any heart or real emotion. i rigged up my special
effects,  checked  out  the  terrain,  measured  distances,  collected  the
ordnance and equipment we'd need. i was professional enough about it, i
didn't make mistakes, but somehow it felt as if i were gearing up to fight

ar  occupied.  he
was crazy about jane fonda. "sweet janie," he kept saying. "sweet janie
boosts a man's morale." then, with his hand, he showed me which part
of  his  morale  got  boosted.  it  was  an  old  joke.  everything  was  old.  the
movie, the heat, the booze, the war. i fell asleep during the second reel—a
hot, angry sleep—and forty minutes later i woke up to a sore ass and a
foul temper.

it wasn't yet midnight.
we hiked over to the em club and worked our way through a six-pack.
mitchell sanders was there, at another table, but he pretended not to see
me.

around closing time, i nodded at azar.
"well, goody gumdrop," he said.
we  went  over  to  my  hootch,  picked  up  our  gear,  and  then  moved
through the night down to the wire. i felt like a soldier again. back in the
bush, it seemed. we observed good field discipline, not talking, keeping
to the shadows and joining in with the darkness. when we came up on
bunker six, azar lifted his thumb and peeled away from me and began

sandbag. his face was filthy.

up at the medic's hootch, he cleaned and bandaged my forehead, then
we went to chow. we didn't have much to say. i told him i was sorry; he
told me the same thing.

afterward, in an awkward moment, i said, "let's kill azar."
jorgenson smiled. "scare him to death, right?"
"right," i said.
"what a movie!"
i shrugged. "sure. or just kill him."


night life


a  few  words  about  rat  kiley.  i  wasn't  there  when  he  got  hurt,  but
mitchell sanders later told me the essential facts. apparently he lost his
cool.

the  platoon  had  been  working  an  ao  out  in  the  foothills  west  of
quang  ngai  city,  and  for  some  time  they'd  been  receiving  intelligence
about  an  nva  buildup  in  the  area.  the  usual  crazy  rumors:  massed
artillery and russian tanks and whole divisions of fresh troops. no one



took  it  seriously,  including  lieutenant  cross,  but  as  a  precaution  the
platoon  moved  only  at  night,  staying  of

voice—that  hum  in  your
ears—and  in  the  hours  after  midnight  you'd  swear  you  were  walking
through some kind of soft black protoplasm, vietnam, the blood and the
flesh.

it  was  no  joke,  sanders  said.  the  monkeys  chattered  death-chatter.

the nights got freaky.

rat kiley finally hit a wall.
he couldn't sleep during the hot daylight hours; he couldn't cope with

the nights.

late  one  afternoon,  as  the  platoon  prepared  for  another  march,  he
broke down in front of mitchell sanders. not crying, but up against it. he
said he was scared. and it wasn't normal scared. he didn't know what it
was:  too  long  in-country,  probably.  or  else  he  wasn't  cut  out  to  be  a
medic. always policing up the parts, he said. always plugging up holes.
sometimes he'd stare at guys who were still okay, the alive guys, and he'd
start to picture how they'd look dead. without arms or legs—that sort of
thing. it was ghoulish, he knew that, but he couldn't shut off the pictures.



he'd b

bad, but at night the pictures
get to be a bitch. i start seeing my own body. chunks of myself. my own
heart, my own kidneys. it's like—i don't know—it's like staring into this
huge black crystal ball. one of these nights i'll be lying dead out there in
the  dark  and  nobody'll  find  me  except  the  bugs—i can see it—i can see
the  goddamn  bugs  chewing  tunnels  through  me—i  can  see  the
mongooses munching on my bones. i swear, it's too much. i can't keep
seeing myself dead."

mitchell sanders nodded. he didn't know what to say. for a time they

sat watching the shadows come, then rat shook his head.

he said he'd done his best. he'd tried to be a decent medic. win some
and lose some, he said, but he'd tried hard. briefly then, rambling a little,
he talked about a few of the guys who were gone now, curt lemon and
kiowa and ted lavender, and how crazy it was that people who were so
incredibly alive could get so incredibly dead.

then he almost laughed.
"this whole war," he said. "you

own.

for  a  while  nobody  said  much.  then  mitchell  sanders  laughed  and

looked over at the green plastic poncho.

"hey, lavender," he said, "how's the war today?"
there was a short quiet.
"mellow," somebody said.
"well,  that's  good,"  sanders  murmured,  "that's  real,  real  good.  stay

cool now."

"hey, no sweat, i'm mellow."
"just  ease  on  back,  then.  don't  need  no  pills.  we  got  this  incredible

chopper on call, this once in a lifetime mind-trip."

"oh, yeah—mellow!"
mitchell sanders smiled. "there it is, my man, this chopper gonna take
you  up  high  and  cool.  gonna  relax  you.  gonna  alter  your  whole
perspective on this sorry, sorry shit."

we  could  almost  see  ted  lavender's  dreamy  blue  eyes.  we  could

almost hear him.

"roger that," somebody said. "i'm ready to fly."
there  was  the  sound  of  the  wind,  the  sound  of  birds  and  the  quiet

afternoon, which was the world we were in.

 the  arms,  and  we
counted to three, working up momentum, and then we tossed the body
high  and  watched  it  bounce  and  come  to  rest  among  the  other  bodies.
the  dead  had  been  dead  for  more  than  a  day.  they  were  all  badly
bloated. their clothing was stretched tight like sausage skins, and when
we picked them up, some made sharp burping sounds as the gases were
released.  they  were  heavy.  their  feet  were  bluish  green  and  cold.  the
smell was terrible. at one point mitchell sanders looked at me and said,
"hey, man, i just realized something."

"what?"
he  wiped  his  eyes  and  spoke  very  quietly,  as  if  awed  by  his  own

wisdom.

"death sucks," he said.



lying in bed at night, i made up elaborate stories to bring linda alive
in  my  sleep.  i  invented  my  own  dreams.  it  sounds  impossible,  i  know,
but i did it. i'd picture somebody's birthday party—a crowded room, i'd
think, and a big chocolate cake with pink candles—and then soon i'd be
dreaming  it,
