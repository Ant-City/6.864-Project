help them as much as possible. not only did he owe langdon a favor, but teabing
was a grail researcher, and sophie claimed her grandfather was the actual grand master of the
priory of sion. if teabing heard that, he would salivate at the thought of helping them figure this
out.

"teabing could be a powerful ally," langdon said. depending on how much you want to tell him.

"fache probably will be offering a monetary reward."

langdon laughed. "believe me, money is the last thing this guy needs." leigh teabing was
wealthy in the way small countries were wealthy. a descendant of britain's first duke of
lancaster, teabing had gotten his money the old-fashioned way — he'd inherited it. his estate
outside of paris was a seventeenth-century palace with two private lakes.

langdon had first met teabing several years ago through the british broadcasting corporation.
teabing had approached the bbc with a proposal for a historical documentary in which he would
expose the explosive history of the holy grail

philadelphia. the card simply read: et tu, robert?

"robert," sophie asked, "you're certain we can trust this man?"

"absolutely. we're colleagues, he doesn't need money, and i happen to know he despises the
french authorities. the french government taxes him at absurd rates because he bought a historic
landmark. he'll be in no hurry to cooperate with fache."

sophie stared out at the dark roadway. "if we go to him, how much do you want to tell him?"

langdon looked unconcerned. "believe me, leigh teabing knows more about the priory of sion
and the holy grail than anyone on earth. "

sophie eyed him. "more than my grandfather?"

"i meant more than anyone outside the brotherhood."

"how do you know teabing isn't a member of the brotherhood?"

"teabing has spent his life trying to broadcast the truth about the holy grail. the priory's oath is to
keep its true nature hidden. "

"sounds to me like a conflict of interest."

langdon understood her concerns. sauniere had given the cryptex directly to s

"nice friends."

"you know the estate?"

"i've passed it. it's in the castle district. twenty minutes from here."

langdon frowned. "that far?"

"yes, which will give you enough time to tell me what the holy grail really is."

langdon paused. "i'll tell you at teabing's. he and i specialize in different areas of the legend, so
between the two of us, you'll get the full story." langdon smiled. "besides, the grail has been
teabing's life, and hearing the story of the holy grail from leigh teabing will be like hearing the
theory of relativity from einstein himself."

"let's hope leigh doesn't mind late-night visitors."

"for the record, it's sir leigh." langdon had made that mistake only once. "teabing is quite a
character. he was knighted by the queen several years back after composing an extensive history
on the house of york."

sophie looked over. "you're kidding, right? we're going to visit a knight?"

langdon gave an awkward smile. "we're on a grail quest, sophie. who better to help

s northwest of
paris in the environs of versailles. designed by francois mansart in 1668 for the count of aufflay,
it was one of paris's most significant historical chateaux. complete with two rectangular lakes and
gardens designed by le notre, chateau villette was more of a modest castle than a mansion. the
estate fondly had become known as la petite versailles.

langdon brought the armored truck to a shuddering stop at the foot of the mile-long driveway.
beyond the imposing security gate, sir leigh teabing's residence rose on a meadow in the
distance. the sign on the gate was in english: private property. no trespassing.

as if to proclaim his home a british isle unto itself, teabing had not only posted his signs in
english, but he had installed his gate's intercom entry system on the right-hand side of the



truck — the passenger's side everywhere in europe except england.

sophie gave the misplaced intercom an odd look. "and if someone arrives without a passenger?"

"don't ask." langdon had

langdon shifted his position, leaning out across sophie to press the intercom button. as he did, an
alluring whiff of sophie's perfume filled his nostrils, and he realized how close they were. he
waited there, awkwardly prone, while a telephone began ringing over the small speaker.

finally, the intercom crackled and an irritated french accent spoke. "chateau villette. who is
calling?"

"this is robert langdon," langdon called out, sprawled across sophie's lap. "i'm a friend of sir
leigh teabing. i need his help."

"my master is sleeping. as was i. what is your business with him?"

"it is a private matter. one of great interest to him."

"then i'm sure he will be pleased to receive you in the morning."

langdon shifted his weight. "it's quite important."

"as is sir leigh's sleep. if you are a friend, then you are aware he is in poor health."

sir leigh teabing had suffered from polio as a child and now wore leg braces and walked with
crutches, but langdon had found him such a lively a

sophie shook her head. "parisienne. "

"your english is superb."

"thank you. i studied at the royal holloway."

"so then, that explains it." teabing hobbled lower through the shadows. "perhaps robert told you i
schooled just down the road at oxford." teabing fixed langdon with a devilish smile. "of course, i
also applied to harvard as my safety school."



their host arrived at the bottom of the stairs, appearing to sophie no more like a knight than sir
elton john. portly and ruby-faced, sir leigh teabing had bushy red hair and jovial hazel eyes that
seemed to twinkle as he spoke. he wore pleated pants and a roomy silk shirt under a paisley vest.
despite the aluminum braces on his legs, he carried himself with a resilient, vertical dignity that
seemed more a by-product of noble ancestry than any kind of conscious effort.

teabing arrived and extended a hand to langdon. "robert, you've lost weight."

langdon grinned. "and you've found some."

teabing laughed heartily, patting his rotund belly. "t

 scandalous look. "robert, i thought you were a gentleman.
you've robbed her of the climax!"

"i know, i thought perhaps you and i could..." langdon apparently decided the unseemly metaphor
had gone far enough.

teabing already had sophie locked in his twinkling gaze. "you are a grail virgin, my dear. and
trust me, you will never forget your first time."



chapter 55

seated on the divan beside langdon, sophie drank her tea and ate a scone, feeling the welcome
effects of caffeine and food. sir leigh teabing was beaming as he awkwardly paced before the
open fire, his leg braces clicking on the stone hearth.

"the holy grail," teabing said, his voice sermonic. "most people ask me only where it is. i fear
that is a question i may never answer." he turned and looked directly at sophie. "however... the far
more relevant question is this: what is the holy grail?"

sophie sensed a rising air of academic anticipation now in both of her male companions.

"to fully understand the grail," teabing continued,

when her grandfather came into the kitchen, he saw sophie with the paper and frowned. "you're

sophie said, "you think jesus christ had a girlfriend?"

"no, dear, i said the church should not be allowed to tell us what notions we can and can't
entertain. "

"did jesus have a girlfriend?"

her grandfather was silent for several moments. "would it be so bad if he did?"

sophie considered it and then shrugged. "i wouldn't mind."



sir leigh teabing was still talking. "i shan't bore you with the countless references to jesus and
magdalene's union. that has been explored ad nauseum by modern historians. i would, however,
like to point out the following." he motioned to another passage. "this is from the gospel of mary
magdalene."

sophie had not known a gospel existed in magdalene's words. she read the text:

and peter said, "did the saviour really speak with a woman without our knowledge ?

now, langdon and the others had adjourned suddenly to another room, extinguishing the study
lights as they went. feeling like a panther stalking prey, silas crept to the glass doors. finding
them unlocked, he slipped inside and closed the doors silently behind him. he could hear muffled
voices from another room. silas pulled the pistol from his pocket, turned off the safety, and inched
down the hallway.

lieutenant collet stood alone at the foot of leigh teabing's driveway and gazed up at the massive
house. isolated. dark. good ground cover. collet watched his half-dozen agents spreading silently
out along the length of the fence. they could be over it and have the house surrounded in a matter
of minutes. langdon could not have chosen a more ideal spot for collet's men to make a surprise
assault.

collet was about to call fache himself when at last his phone rang.

fache sounded not nearly as pleased with the developments as collet would have imagined.

inlay he had removed from the lid.

"it covered an engraving on the box. i think the text might tell us how to open the keystone."

before sophie and teabing could respond, a sea of blue police lights and sirens erupted at the
bottom of the hill and began snaking up the half-mile driveway.

teabing frowned. "my friends, it seems we have a decision to make. and we'd better make it fast."



chapter 66

collet and his agents burst through the front door of sir leigh teabing's estate with their guns
drawn. fanning out, they began searching all the rooms on the first level. they found a bullet hole
in the drawing room floor, signs of a struggle, a small amount of blood, a strange, barbed leather
belt, and a partially used roll of duct tape. the entire level seemed deserted.

just as collet was about to divide his men to search the basement and grounds behind the house, he
heard voices on the level above them.

"they're upstairs!"

"i don't know. i haven't yet heard from him."

"well, don't hold your breath. i've got to run, but this explains a lot thanks."

"robert—"

but langdon was gone.

faukman hung up the phone, shaking his head in disbelief authors, he thought. even the sane ones
are nuts.



inside the range rover, leigh teabing let out a guffaw. "robert, you're saying you wrote a
manuscript that delves into a secret society, and your editor sent a copy to that secret society?"

langdon slumped. "evidently."

"a cruel coincidence, my friend."



coincidence has nothing to do with it, langdon knew. asking jacques sauniere to endorse a
manuscript on goddess worship was as obvious as asking tiger woods to endorse a book on golf.
moreover, it was virtually guaranteed that any book on goddess worship would have to mention t

he began to feel the initial frustration resurfacing. "leigh, i just can't seem to

from where sophie was seated across the table, she could not yet see the text, but langdon's
inability to immediately identify the language surprised her. my grandfather spoke a language so
obscure that even a symbologist can't identify it? she quickly realized she should not find this
surprising. this would not be the first secret jacques sauniere had kept from his granddaughter.



opposite sophie, leigh teabing felt ready to burst. eager for his chance to see the text, he
quivered with excitement, leaning in, trying to see around langdon, who was still hunched over the
box.

"i don't know," langdon whispered intently. "my first guess is a semitic, but now i'm not so sure.
most primary semitics include nekkudot. this has none."

"probably ancient," teabing offered.

"nekkudot?" sophie inquired.

teabing never took his eyes from the box. "most modern semitic alphabets have no vowels and

debating whether the nation's police captain was a hero or a menace. that question had just been
answered.



"wait!" the controller heard himself whimper at the sight of the handcuffs. "i can tell you this
much. sir leigh teabing makes frequent trips to london for medical treatments. he has a hangar
at biggin hill executive airport in kent. on the outskirts of london."

fache waved off the man with the cuffs. "is biggin hill his destination tonight?"

"i don't know," the controller said honestly. "the plane left on its usual tack, and his last radar
contact suggested the united kingdom. biggin hill is an extremely likely guess."

"did he have others onboard?"

teabing said, wondering how much it would cost him to persuade his pilot to
perform one highly irregular maneuver.



chapter 81

the hawker is on final approach.

simon edwards — executive services officer at biggin hill airport — paced the control tower,
squinting nervously at the rain-drenched runway. he never appreciated being awoken early on a
saturday morning, but it was particularly distasteful that he had been called in to oversee the arrest
of one of his most lucrative clients. sir leigh teabing paid biggin hill not only for a private
hangar but a "per landing fee" for his frequent arrivals and departures. usually, the airfield had
advance warning of his schedule and was able to follow a strict protocol for his arrival. teabing
liked things just so. the custom-built jaguar stretch limousine that he kept in his hangar was to be



fully gassed, polished, and the day's london times laid out on the back seat. a customs official
was to be waiting for the plane at the hangar to expedite the

on for later departure. as the plane completed its 180-degree
turn and rolled toward the front of the hangar, edwards could see the pilot's face, which
understandably looked surprised and fearful to see the barricade of police cars.

the pilot brought the plane to a final stop, and powered down the engines. the police streamed in,
taking up positions around the jet. edwards joined the kent chief inspector, who moved warily
toward the hatch. after several seconds, the fuselage door popped open.

leigh teabing appeared in the doorway as the plane's electronic stairs smoothly dropped down. as
he gazed out at the sea of weapons aimed at him, he propped himself on his crutches and scratched
his head. "simon, did i win the policemen's lottery while i was away?" he sounded more
bewildered than concerned.

simon edwards stepped forward, swallowing the frog in his throat. "good morning, sir. i apologize
for the confusion. we've had a gas leak and your pilot said he was coming to the terminal."

"yes, yes, w

 you will stay off my plane. i am offering you a reasonable option here. mr.
edwards can perform the inspection."

"no deal."

teabing's demeanor turned frosty. "inspector, i'm afraid i don't have time to indulge in your games.
i'm late, and i'm leaving. if it is that important to you to stop me, you'll just have to shoot me."
with that, teabing and remy walked around the chief inspector and headed across the hangar
toward the parked limousine.



the kent chief inspector felt only distaste for leigh teabing as the man hobbled around him in
defiance. men of privilege always felt like they were above the law.

they are not. the chief inspector turned and aimed at teabing's back. "stop! i will fire!"

"go ahead," teabing said without breaking stride or glancing back. "my lawyers will fricassee
your testicles for breakfast. and if you dare board my plane without a warrant, your spleen will
follow."



no stranger to power plays, the chief inspector was unimpressed. technically, teabing was correct

arriving at the hatch, he peered inside. after a moment, he stepped into the cabin. what the devil?

with the exception of the frightened-looking pilot in the cockpit, the aircraft was empty. entirely
devoid of human life. quickly checking the bathroom, the chairs, and the luggage areas, the
inspector found no traces of anyone hiding... much less multiple individuals.

what the hell was bezu fache thinking? it seemed leigh teabing had been telling the truth.

the kent chief inspector stood alone in the deserted cabin and swallowed hard. shit. his face
flushed, he stepped back onto the gangway, gazing across the hangar at leigh teabing and his
servant, who were now under gunpoint near the limousine. "let them go," the inspector ordered.
"we received a bad tip."

teabing's eyes were menacing even across the hangar. "you can expect a call from my lawyers.
and for future reference, the french police cannot be trusted. "

ryptex. he had a hard time imagining what they might find inside.

langdon eyed the poem again. it was like some kind of primordial crossword puzzle. a five-letter
word that speaks of the grail? on the plane, they had already tried all the obvious
passwords— grail, graal, greal, venus, maria, jesus, sarah— but the cylinder had
not budged. far too obvious. apparently there existed some other five-letter reference to the rose's
seeded womb. the fact that the word was eluding a specialist like leigh teabing signified to
langdon that it was no ordinary grail reference.



"sir leigh?" remy called over his shoulder. he was watching them in the rearview mirror through
the open divider. "you said fleet street is near blackfriars bridge?"

"yes, take victoria embankment."

"i'm sorry. i'm not sure where that is. we usually go only to the hospital."

teabing rolled his eyes at langdon and sophie and grumbled, "i swear, sometimes it's like baby-

silas was amazed. "i don't understand. if you work for the teacher, why did langdon bring the

"not my home. the home of the world's foremost grail historian, sir leigh teabing."

"but you live there. the odds..."

remy smiled, seeming to have no trouble with the apparent coincidence of langdon's chosen
refuge. "it was all utterly predictable. robert langdon was in possession of the keystone, and he
needed help. what more logical place to run than to the home of leigh teabing? that i happen to
live there is why the teacher approached me in the first place." he paused. "how do you think the
teacher knows so much about the grail?"

now it dawned, and silas was stunned.

the teacher had recruited a servant who had access to all
of sir leigh teabing's research. it was brilliant.

"there is much i have to tell you," remy said, handing silas the loaded heckler koch pistol. then
he reached through the open partition and retrieved a small, palm-sized revolver from the glove
box. "but first, you and i have a job to do."

kent chief inspector's account of what had happened in teabing's hangar.

"take me to the plane."

arriving at the hangar, fache needed only sixty seconds to locate an anomalous smear of blood on
the pavement near where the limousine had been parked. fache walked up to the plane and rapped
loudly on the fuselage.

"this is the captain of the french judicial police. open the door!"

silas's gun.

the monk's red eyes filled with anger and frustration, and remy tightened with fear that silas
might actually shoot langdon while he was holding the cryptex. the cryptex cannot fall!

the cryptex was to be remy's ticket to freedom and wealth. a little over a year ago, he was simply
a fifty-five-year-old manservant living within the walls of chateau villette, catering to the whims
of the insufferable cripple sir leigh teabing. then he was approached with an extraordinary
proposition. remy's association with sir leigh teabing — the preeminent grail historian on
earth — was going to bring remy everything he had ever dreamed of in life. since then, every
moment he had spent inside chateau villette had been leading him to this very instant.

in the temple church, with langdon threatening to break the keystone,
remy's future was at risk. unable to bear the thought of coming this close only to lose it all, remy
made the decision to take bold action. the gun in his hand was a concealable, small-caliber, j-
frame medusa, but it would be plenty deadly at close range.

stepping from the shadows, remy marched into the circular chamber and aimed the gun directly at
teabing's head. "old man, i've been waiting a long time to do this."



sir leigh teabing's heart practically stalled to see remy aiming a gun at him. what is he doing!
teabing recognized the tiny medusa revolver as his own, the one he kept locked in the limousine
glove box for safety.

"remy?" teabing sputtered in shock. "what is going on?"

langdon and sophie looked equally dumbstruck.



remy circled behind teabing and rammed the pistol barrel into his back, high and on the left,
directly behind his heart.

teabing felt his muscles seize with terror. "remy, i don't — "

silas sat in the passenger seat of the parked jaguar limousine near the temple church. his hands
felt damp on the keystone as he waited for remy to finish tying and gagging teabing in back with
the rope they had found in the trunk.

finally, remy climbed out of the rear of the limo, walked around, and slid into the driver's seat
beside silas.

"secure?" silas asked.

remy chuckled, shaking off the rain and glancing over his shoulder through the open partition at
the crumpled form of leigh teabing, who was barely visible in the shadows in the rear. "he's not
going anywhere."

silas could hear teabing's muffled cries and realized remy had used some of the old duct tape to
gag him.

"ferme ta gueule!" remy shouted over his shoulder at teabing. reaching to a control panel on the
elaborate dash, remy pressed a button. an opaque partition raised behind them, sealing off the
back. teabing disappeared, and his voice was silenced. remy glanced at silas. "i've been listening

gettum shifted, looking uncertain. "normally our services are by petition and appointment only,

unfortunately, their only chance to recover the keystone seemed to be here and now... at the tomb
of isaac newton. whoever held the cryptex would have to pay a visit to the tomb to decipher the
final clue, and if they had not already come and gone, sophie and langdon intended to intercept
them.

striding toward the left wall to get out of the open, they moved into an obscure side aisle behind a
row of pilasters. langdon couldn't shake the image of leigh teabing being held captive, probably
tied up in the back of his own limousine. whoever had ordered the top priory members killed
would not hesitate to eliminate others who stood in the way. it seemed a cruel irony that
teabing — a modern british knight — was a hostage in the search for his own countryman, sir isaac
newton.

"which way is it?" sophie asked, looking around.

they were standing in an enormous dead end.



the creaking of a heavy door behind them made them turn, just as the door closed with a
resounding thud and the latch fell into place.

the lone man who had been standing behind the door looked calm as he aimed a small revolver at

for a moment langdon thought he must be dreaming.

it was leigh teabing.

sir leigh teabing felt rueful as he gazed out over the barrel of his medusa revolver at robert
langdon and sophie neveu. "my friends," he said, "since the moment you walked into my home
last night, i have done everything in my power to keep you out of harm's way. but your persistence
has now put me in a difficult position."

he could see the expressions of shock and betrayal on sophie's and langdon's faces, and yet he
was confident that soon they would both understand the chain

robert langdon had given up trying to get his bearings. despite the torrent of questions running
through his mind, he knew only one thing mattered now — getting sophie out of here alive. all the
guilt langdon had mistakenly felt earlier for involving teabing had now been transferred to
sophie.

langdon could not fathom that leigh teabing would be capable of killing them in cold blood here
in the chapter house, and yet teabing certainly had been involved in killing others during his
misguided quest. langdon had the uneasy feeling that gunshots in this secluded, thick-walled
chamber would go unheard, especially in this rain. and leigh just admitted his guilt to us.

langdon glanced at sophie, who looked shaken. the church murdered sophie 's family to silence
the priory? langdon felt certain the modern church did not murder people

aringarosa closed his eyes. "silas, you must pray."

robert langdon stood beneath the lofty cupola of the deserted chapter house and stared into the



barrel of leigh teabing's gun.

robert, are you with me, or against me? the royal historian's words echoed in the silence of
langdon's mind.

there was no viable response, langdon knew. answer yes, and he would be selling out sophie.
answer no, and teabing would have no choice but to kill them both.

confrontations at gunpoint, but the classroom had taught him something about answering

were everywhere. like a taunting silhouette emerging from the fog, the branches of britain's oldest
apple tree burgeoned with five-petaled blossoms, all glistening like venus. the goddess was in the
garden now. she was dancing in the rain, singing songs of the ages, peeking out from behind the
bud-filled branches as if to remind langdon that the fruit of knowledge was growing just beyond
his reach.



across the room, sir leigh teabing watched with confidence as langdon gazed out the window as
if under a spell.

exactly as i hoped, teabing thought. he will come around.

for some time now, teabing had suspected langdon might hold the key to the grail. it was no
coincidence that teabing launched his plan into action on the same night langdon was scheduled
to meet jacques sauniere. listening in on the curator, teabing was certain the man's eagerness to
meet privately with langdon could mean only one thing. langdon' s mysterious

langdon had almost shouted out in desperation. but i cannot see how!

the stark moments of disillusionment had brought with them a clarity unlike any he had ever felt.
the truth is right before your eyes, robert. he knew not from where the epiphany came. the grail
is not mocking you, she is calling out to a worthy soul.

now, bowing down like a subject several yards in front of leigh teabing, langdon lowered the
cryptex to within inches of the stone floor.

"yes, robert," teabing whispered, aiming the gun at him. "set it down."

langdon's eyes moved heavenward, up into the gaping void of the chapter house cupola.
crouching lower, langdon lowered his gaze to teabing's gun, aimed directly at him.

"i'm sorry, leigh."



in one fluid motion, langdon leapt up, swinging his arm skyward, launching the cryptex straight
up toward the dome above.

face.

he knows! teabing's heart craved that knowledge. his life's dream was right in front of him. "tell
me!" teabing demanded. "please! oh god, please! it's not too late!"

as the sound of heavy footsteps thundered down the hall toward the chapter house, langdon
quietly rolled the papyrus and slipped it back in his pocket.



"no!" teabing cried out, trying in vain to stand.

when the doors burst open, bezu fache entered like a bull into a ring, his feral eyes scanning,
finding his target — leigh teabing — helpless on the floor. exhaling in relief, fache holstered his
manurhin sidearm and turned to sophie. "agent neveu, i am relieved you and mr. langdon are
safe. you should have come in when i asked."

the british police entered on fache's heels, seizing the anguished prisoner and placing him in
handcuffs.

sophie seemed stunned to see fache. "how did you find us?"

fache pointed to teabing. "he made the mistake of showing his id when he entered the abbey.

und him now, and silas felt so light that he was sure the wisps would
carry him away. closing his eyes, he said a final prayer.

from somewhere in the mist, the voice of manuel aringarosa whispered to him.

our lord is a good and merciful god.

silas's pain at last began to fade, and he knew the bishop was right.



chapter 103

it was late afternoon when the london sun broke through and the city began to dry. bezu fache
felt weary as he emerged from the interrogation room and hailed a cab. sir leigh teabing had
vociferously proclaimed his innocence, and yet from his incoherent rantings about the holy grail,



secret documents, and mysterious brotherhoods, fache suspected the wily historian was setting the
stage for his lawyers to plead an insanity defense.

sure, fache thought. insane. teabing had displayed ingenious precision in formulating a plan that
protected his innocence at every turn. he had exploited both the vatican and opus dei, two groups
that turned out to be completely innocent. his

stop the horrific chain of events he had helped put in motion was to confess everything to fache,
and from that moment on, aringarosa and fache had been racing to catch up with silas before the
teacher persuaded him to kill again.

feeling bone weary, aringarosa closed his eyes and listened to the television coverage of the arrest
of a prominent british knight, sir leigh teabing. the teacher laid bare for all to see. teabing had
caught wind of the vatican's plans to disassociate itself from opus dei. he had chosen aringarosa
as the perfect pawn in his plan. after all, who more likely to leap blindly after the holy grail than
a man like myself with everything to lose? the grail would have brought enormous power to
anyone who possessed it.

leigh teabing had protected his identity shrewdly — feigning a french accent and a pious heart,

will endure this. there are always those waiting to move up and rebuild."

all evening langdon had suspected that sophie's grandmother was closely tied to the operations of
the priory. after all, the priory had always had women members. four grand masters had been
women. the senechaux were traditionally men — the guardians — and yet women held far more
honored status within the priory and could ascend to the highest post from virtually any rank.

langdon thought of leigh teabing and westminster abbey. it seemed a lifetime ago. "was the
church pressuring your husband not to release the sangreal documents at the end of days?"

"heavens no. the end of days is a legend of paranoid minds. there is nothing in the priory
doctrine that identifies a date at which the grail should be unveiled. in fact the priory has always
maintained that the grail should never be unveiled."

"never?" langdon was stunned.

"it is the mystery and wonderment that serve our souls, not the grail its
