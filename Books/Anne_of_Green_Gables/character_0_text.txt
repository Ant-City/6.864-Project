the child hesitated for a moment.

â€œwill you please call me cordelia?â€ she said eagerly.

â€œ_call_ you cordelia? is that your name?â€

â€œno-o-o, itâ€™s not exactly my name, but i would love to be called
cordelia. itâ€™s such a perfectly elegant name.â€

â€œi donâ€™t know what on earth you mean. if cordelia isnâ€™t your name, what
is?â€

â€œanne shirley,â€ reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name, â€œbut,
oh, please do call me cordelia. it canâ€™t matter much to you what you
call me if iâ€™m only going to be here a little while, can it? and anne is
such an unromantic name.â€

â€œunromantic fiddlesticks!â€ said the unsympathetic marilla. â€œanne is a
real good plain sensible name. youâ€™ve no need to be ashamed of it.â€

â€œoh, iâ€™m not ashamed of it,â€ explained anne, â€œonly i like cordelia

a little girl to adopt. i was certainly told so. but it seems it was a
boy they wanted. so if youâ€™re still of the same mind you were yesterday,

mrs. blewett darted her eyes over anne from head to foot.

â€œhow old are you and whatâ€™s your name?â€ she demanded.

â€œanne shirley,â€ faltered the shrinking child, not daring to make any
stipulations regarding the spelling thereof, â€œand iâ€™m eleven years old.â€

have made it much more flowery if iâ€™d had a little more time to think it
over.â€

poor marilla was only preserved from complete collapse by remembering
that it was not irreverence, but simply spiritual ignorance on the part
of anne that was responsible for this extraordinary petition. she tucked
the child up in bed, mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer
the very next day, and was leaving the room with t

she did not think she liked miss rogerson, and she felt very miserable;
every other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. anne felt that
life was really not worth living without puffed sleeves.

â€œwell, how did you like sunday school?â€ marilla wanted to know when anne
came home. her wreath having faded, anne had discarded it in the lane,
so marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.

â€œi didnâ€™t like it a bit. it was horrid.â€

â€œanne shirley!â€ said marilla rebukingly.

anne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of bonnyâ€™s
leaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.

â€œthey might have been lonesome while i was away,â€ she explained. â€œand
now about the sunday school. i behaved well, just as you told me. mrs.

they went over to orchard slope by the short cut across the brook and up
the firry hill grove. mrs. barry came to the kitchen door in answer to
marillaâ€™s knock. she was a tall black-eyed, black-haired woman, with a
very resolute mouth. she had the reputation of being very strict with
her children.

â€œhow do you do, marilla?â€ she said cordially. â€œcome in. and this is the
little girl you have adopted, i suppose?â€

â€œyes, this is anne shirley,â€ said marilla.

â€œspelled with an e,â€ gasped anne, who, tremulous and excited as she was,
was determined there should be no misunderstanding on that important
point.

mrs. barry, not hearing or not comprehending, merely shook hands and
said kindly:

â€œhow are you?â€

â€œi am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit, thank you

â€œthere wasnâ€™t anything startling in that, was there, marilla?â€

hour more â€˜n i gave her leave to; and now sheâ€™s perched out there on
the woodpile talking to matthew, nineteen to the dozen, when she knows
perfectly well she ought to be at her work. and of course heâ€™s listening
to her like a perfect ninny. i never saw such an infatuated man.
the more she talks and the odder the things she says, the more heâ€™s
delighted evidently. anne shirley, you come right in here this minute,

a series of staccato taps on the west window brought anne flying in from
the yard, eyes shining, cheeks faintly flushed with pink, unbraided hair
streaming behind her in a torrent of brightness.

â€œoh, marilla,â€ she exclaimed breathlessly, â€œthereâ€™s going to be a

near the lake of shining waters. and mrs. superintendent bell and mrs.

â€œyes, i suppose i am,â€ agreed anne tranquilly. â€œand i know iâ€™ll have to
be punished. itâ€™ll be your duty to punish me, marilla. wonâ€™t you please
get it over right off because iâ€™d like to go to the picnic with nothing

â€œpicnic, indeed! youâ€™ll go to no picnic today, anne shirley. that shall
be your punishment. and it isnâ€™t half severe enough either for what
youâ€™ve done!â€

â€œnot go to the picnic!â€ anne sprang to her feet and clutched marillaâ€™s
hand. â€œbut you _promised_ me i might! oh, marilla, i must go to the
picnic. that was why i confessed. punish me any way you like but that.
oh, marilla, please, please, let me go to the picnic. think of the ice

minute. i suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow. well!â€

marilla betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand. anne had cried
herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window.

â€œanne shirley,â€ said marilla solemnly, â€œiâ€™ve just found my brooch
hanging to my black lace shawl. now i want to know what that rigmarole
you told me this morning meant.â€

â€œwhy, you said youâ€™d keep me here until i confessed,â€ returned anne
wearily, â€œand so i decided to confess because i was bound to get to the

but it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.

mr. phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to
prissy andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as
they pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their
slates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle.
gilbert blythe was trying to make anne shirley look at him and failing
utterly, because anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only
to the very existence of gilbert blythe, but of every other scholar in
avonlea school itself. with her chin propped on her hands and her eyes
fixed on the blue glimpse of the lake of shining waters that the west
window afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and
seeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.

gilbert blythe wasnâ€™t used to putting himself out to make a girl look

thwack! anne had brought her slate down on gilbertâ€™s head and
cracked it--slate not head--clear across.

avonlea school always enjoyed a scene. this was an especially enjoyable
one. everybody said â€œohâ€ in horrified delight. diana gasped. ruby
gillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. tommy
sloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared
open-mouthed at the tableau.

mr. phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on anneâ€™s
shoulder.

â€œanne shirley, what does this mean?â€ he said angrily. anne returned no
answer. it was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell
before the whole school that she had been called â€œcarrots.â€ gilbert it
was who spoke up stoutly.

â€œit was my fault mr. phillips. i teased her.â€

mr. phillips paid no heed to gilbert.

a vindictive spirit,â€ he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of
being a pupil of his ought to ro

and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as mr.
phillips was in the act of hanging up his hat.

mr. phillipsâ€™s brief reforming energy was over; he didnâ€™t want the
bother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something
to save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it
in anne, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a
forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a
particularly rakish and disheveled appearance.

â€œanne shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boysâ€™ company we
shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,â€ he said sarcastically.
â€œtake those flowers out of your hair and sit with gilbert blythe.â€

the other boys snickered. diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the
wreath from anneâ€™s hair and squeezed her hand. anne stared at the master
as if turned to stone.

â€œdid you hear what i said, anne?â€ queried mr. phillips sternly.

â€œyes, sir,â€ said anne slowly â€œbut i didnâ€™t suppose y

breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face. and then bidding diana
goodbye-e-e--â€ here anne broke down entirely and wept with increasing
bitterness.

marilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no
use; she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and
unusual peal of laughter that matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted
in amazement. when had he heard marilla laugh like that before?

â€œwell, anne shirley,â€ said marilla as soon as she could speak, â€œif you
must borrow trouble, for pityâ€™s sake borrow it handier home. i should
think you had an imagination, sure enough.â€

afternoon marilla sent her down to mrs. lyndeâ€™s on an errand. in a very
short space of time anne came flying back up the lane with tears rolling
down her cheeks. into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face
downward on the sofa in an agony.

â€œwhatever has gone wrong now, anne?â€ queried marilla in doubt and
dismay. â€œi do hope you havenâ€™t gone and been saucy to mrs. lynde again.â€

no answer from anne save more tears and stormier sobs!

â€œanne shirley, when i ask you a question i want to be answered. sit
right up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about.â€

anne sat up, tragedy personified.

â€œmrs. lynde was up to see mrs. barry today and mrs. barry was in an
awful state,â€ she wailed. â€œshe says that i set diana _drunk_ saturday

anything to do with the fortunes of little anne shirley at green gables.

it was a january the premier came, to address his loyal supporters and
such of his nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass
meeting held in charlottetown. most of the avonlea people were on
premierâ€™s side of politics; hence on the night of the meeting nearly

wouldnâ€™t wake you up. she says you saved minnie mayâ€™s life, and she is
very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine. she
says she knows now you didnâ€™t mean to set diana drunk, and she hopes
youâ€™ll forgive her and be good friends with diana again. youâ€™re to go
over this evening if you like for diana canâ€™t stir outside the door

the warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was anneâ€™s
expression and attitude as she sprang to her feet, her face irradiated
with the flame of her spirit.

â€œoh, marilla, can i go right now--without washing my dishes? iâ€™ll wash
them when i come back, but i cannot tie myself down to anything so
unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment.â€

â€œi guess once is enough to say them. this is matthewâ€™s doings and i

i donâ€™t care. but father and mother do.â€

â€œwhy didnâ€™t you tell them it was my fault?â€ demanded anne.

â€œitâ€™s likely iâ€™d do such a thing, isnâ€™t it?â€ said diana with just scorn.
â€œiâ€™m no telltale, anne shirley, and anyhow i was just as much to blame
as you.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™m going in to tell her myself,â€ said anne resolutely.

diana stared.

â€œanne shirley, youâ€™d never! why--sheâ€™ll eat you alive!â€

â€œdonâ€™t frighten me any more than i am frightened,â€ implored anne. â€œiâ€™d
rather walk up to a cannonâ€™s mouth. but iâ€™ve got to do it, diana. it
was my fault and iâ€™ve got to confess. iâ€™ve had practice in confessing,
fortunately.â€

â€œoh--itâ€™s--itâ€™s too dark,â€ cried anne.

â€œtoo dark? why, itâ€™s only twilight. and goodness knows youâ€™ve gone over
often enough after dark.â€

â€œiâ€™ll go over early in the morning,â€ said anne eagerly. â€œiâ€™ll get up at
sunrise and go over, marilla.â€

â€œwhat has got into your head now, anne shirley? i want that pattern to
cut out your new apron this evening. go at once and be smart too.â€

â€œiâ€™ll have to go around by the road, then,â€ said anne, taking up her hat
reluctantly.

â€œgo by the road and waste half an hour! iâ€™d like to catch you!â€

â€œi canâ€™t go through the haunted wood, marilla,â€ cried anne desperately.

marilla stared.

â€œthe haunted wood! are you crazy? what under the canopy is the haunted
wood?â€

â€œthe spruce wood over the brook,â€ said anne in a whisper.

thereâ€™s a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower

haunted wood after dark now for anything. iâ€™d be sure that white things
would reach out from behind the trees and grab me.â€

â€œdid ever anyone hear the like!â€ ejaculated marilla, who had
listened in dumb amazement. â€œanne shirley, do you mean to tell me you
believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?â€

â€œnot believe _exactly_,â€ faltered anne. â€œat least, i donâ€™t believe it in

walk.â€

â€œthere are no such things as ghosts, anne.â€

a plump triangle, as did also the minister and marilla.

mrs. allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression
crossed her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away

it all rank foolishness.

things like that are of no importance now because i donâ€™t suppose iâ€™ll

anne had slid to the floor in despairing obedience.

â€œlook at my hair, marilla,â€ she whispered.

accordingly, marilla lifted her candle and looked scrutinizingly at
anneâ€™s hair, flowing in heavy masses down her back. it certainly had a
very strange appearance.

â€œanne shirley, what have you done to your hair? why, itâ€™s _green!_â€

marilla, you little know how utterly wretched i am.â€

â€œi little know how you got into this fix, but i mean to find out,â€ said
marilla. â€œcome right down to the kitchen--itâ€™s too cold up here--and
tell me just what youâ€™ve done. iâ€™ve been expecting something queer for
some time. you havenâ€™t got into any scrape for over two months, and i
was sure another one was due. now, then, what did you do to your hair?â€

â€œi dyed it.â€

â€œdyed it! dyed your hair! anne shirley, didnâ€™t you know it was a wicked
thing to do?â€

â€œyes, i knew it was a little wicked,â€ admitted anne. â€œbut i thought it
was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair. i counted
the cost, marilla. besides, i meant to be extra good in other ways to
make up for it.â€

â€œwell,â€ said marilla sarcastically, â€œif iâ€™d decided it was worth while
to dye my hair iâ€™d have dyed it a decent color at least. i wouldnâ€™t have
dyed it green.â€

â€œbut i didnâ€™t mean to dye it

positively assured me that it
would. how could i doubt his word, marilla? i know what it feels like
to have your word doubted. and mrs. allan says we should never suspect
anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that theyâ€™re
not. i have proof now--green hair is proof enough for anybody. but i
hadnâ€™t then and i believed every word he said _implicitly_.â€

â€œwho said? who are you talking about?â€

â€œthe peddler that was here this afternoon. i bought the dye from him.â€

â€œanne shirley, how often have i told you never to let one of those
italians in the house! i donâ€™t believe in encouraging them to come
around at all.â€

â€œoh, i didnâ€™t let him in the house. i remembered what you told me, and i
went out, carefully shut the door, and looked at his things on the step.
besides, he wasnâ€™t an italian--he was a german jew. he had a big box
full of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to
make enough money to bring his wife and children out from germany.

 at the
wicked green depths below her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and
shivered. her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome
possibilities to her.

then, just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her
arms and wrists another moment, gilbert blythe came rowing under the
bridge in harmon andrewsâ€™s dory!

gilbert glanced up and, much to his amazement, beheld a little white
scornful face looking down upon him with big, frightened but also
scornful gray eyes.

â€œanne shirley! how on earth did you get there?â€ he exclaimed.

without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended
his hand. there was no help for it; anne, clinging to gilbert blytheâ€™s
hand, scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious,
in the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe. it was
certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!

â€œwhat has happened, anne?â€ asked gilbert, taking up his oars. â€œwe were

otsâ€ and had brought about her disgrace before the whole
school. her resentment, which to other and older people might be as
laughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened by time
seemingly. she hated gilbert blythe! she would never forgive him!

â€œno,â€ she said coldly, â€œi shall never be friends with you, gilbert
blythe; and i donâ€™t want to be!â€

â€œall right!â€ gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his
cheeks. â€œiâ€™ll never ask you to be friends again, anne shirley. and i
donâ€™t care either!â€

he pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and anne went up the steep,
ferny little path under the maples. she held her head very high, but
she was conscious of an odd feeling of regret. she almost wished she had
answered gilbert differently. of course, he had insulted her terribly,
but still--! altogether, anne rather thought it would be a relief to
sit down and have a good cry. she was really quite unstrung, for the
reaction from her fright and cramped clinging

eviously the
rivalry had been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt
that gilbert was as determined to be first in class as anne was. he was
a foeman worthy of her steel. the other members of the class tacitly
acknowledged their superiority, and never dreamed of trying to compete
with them.

since the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea
for forgiveness, gilbert, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry,
had evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of anne shirley. he
talked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with
them, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the
other of them from prayer meeting or debating club. but anne shirley
he simply ignored, and anne found out that it is not pleasant to be
ignored. it was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head
that she did not care. deep down in her wayward, feminine little heart
she knew that she did care, and that if she had that chance of the lake

low white bed.

anne was dressing for a concert at the white sands hotel. the guests had
got it up in aid of the charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all
the available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it
along. bertha sampson and pearl clay of the white sands baptist choir
had been asked to sing a duet; milton clark of newbridge was to give a
violin solo; winnie adella blair of carmody was to sing a scotch ballad;
and laura spencer of spencervale and anne shirley of avonlea were to
recite.

as anne would have said at one time, it was â€œan epoch in her life,â€ and
she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. matthew was in
the seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his
anne and marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather
than admit it, and said she didnâ€™t think it was very proper for a lot
of young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible
person with them.

walked home with her from the train, over the
crisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and
merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening
around them and their hopes and ambitions therein. gilbert was a clever
young fellow, with his own thoughts about things and a determination to
get the best out of life and put the best into it. ruby gillis told jane
andrews that she didnâ€™t understand half the things gilbert blythe said;
he talked just like anne shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on
and for her part she didnâ€™t think it any fun to be bothering about books
and that sort of thing when you didnâ€™t have to. frank stockley had lots
more dash and go, but then he wasnâ€™t half as good-looking as gilbert and
she really couldnâ€™t decide which she liked best!

in the academy anne gradually drew a little circle of friends about
her, thoughtful, imaginative, ambitious students like herself. with the
â€œrose-redâ€ girl, stella maynard, and the â

as aerial and rainbow-like as anneâ€™s own.

after the christmas holidays the avonlea students gave up going home
on fridays and settled down to hard work. by this time all the queenâ€™s
scholars had gravitated into their own places in the ranks and
the various classes had assumed distinct and settled shadings of
individuality. certain facts had become generally accepted. it was
admitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down
to three--gilbert blythe, anne shirley, and lewis wilson; the avery
scholarship was more doubtful, any one of a certain six being a possible
winner. the bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as
won by a fat, funny little up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a
patched coat.

ruby gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the academy; in the
second year classes stella maynard carried off the palm for beauty, with
small but critical minority in favor of anne shirley. ethel marr was
admitted by all competent judges

you go pitying me. i donâ€™t like to be pitied, and there is no need
for it. iâ€™m heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear green
gables. nobody could love it as you and i do--so we must keep it.â€

â€œyou blessed girl!â€ said marilla, yielding. â€œi feel as if youâ€™d given me
new life. i guess i ought to stick out and make you go to college--but
i know i canâ€™t, so i ainâ€™t going to try. iâ€™ll make it up to you though,
anne.â€

when it became noised abroad in avonlea that anne shirley had given up
the idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there
was a good deal of discussion over it. most of the good folks, not
knowing about marillaâ€™s eyes, thought she was foolish. mrs. allan did
not. she told anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure
to the girlâ€™s eyes. neither did good mrs. lynde. she came up one evening
and found anne and marilla sitting at the front door in the warm,
scented summer dusk. they liked to sit there when the twilight

real glad to hear it. youâ€™ve got as much education now as a woman can be
comfortable with. i donâ€™t believe in girls going to college with the men
and cramming their heads full of latin and greek and all that nonsense.â€

â€œbut iâ€™m going to study latin and greek just the same, mrs. lynde,â€ said
anne laughing. â€œiâ€™m going to take my arts course right here at green
gables, and study everything that i would at college.â€

mrs. lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.

â€œanne shirley, youâ€™ll kill yourself.â€

â€œnot a bit of it. i shall thrive on it. oh, iâ€™m not going to overdo
things. as â€˜josiah allenâ€™s wife,â€™ says, i shall be â€˜mejumâ€™. but iâ€™ll
have lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and iâ€™ve no
vocation for fancy work. iâ€™m going to teach over at carmody, you know.â€

â€œi donâ€™t know it. i guess youâ€™re going to teach right here in avonlea.
