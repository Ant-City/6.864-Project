Mr. Brocklehurst - 
 The cruel, hypocritical master of the Lowood School,
Mr. Brocklehurst preaches a doctrine of privation, while stealing
from the school to support his luxurious lifestyle. After a typhus
epidemic sweeps Lowood, Brocklehurst's shifty and dishonest practices are
brought to light and he is publicly discredited.
