[CHARACTER] - 
 a harvard history professor and the official u.s.
air force historian who is laid up by a skiing accident in the same
vermont hospital as billy after his plane crash. rumfoord's reluctance
to believe that billy was present during the dresden raid embodies
the bureaucratic attitude that seeks to glorify the war and its
heroes instead of realistically portraying war's destructiveness
and its haphazard selection of survivors.
