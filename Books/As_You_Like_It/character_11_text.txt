 get you with him, you old dog.

  adam. is 'old dog' my reward? most true, i have lost my teeth in
    your service. god be with my old master! he would not have spoke
    such a word.
                                         exeunt orlando and adam

  oliver. is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? i will physic
    your rankness, and yet give no thousand crowns neither.
    holla, dennis!

                          enter dennis


  dennis. calls your worship?

  oliver. not charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?

  dennis. so please you, he is here at the door and importunes access
    to you.

  oliver. call him in. [exit dennis] 'twill be a good way; and
    to-morrow the wrestling is.

                          enter charles


  charles. good morrow to your worship.

  oliver. good monsieur charles! what's the new news at the new
    court?

  charles. there's no news at the court, sir, but the old news; that
    is, the old duke is banis

hed by his younger brother the new duke;
    and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
    exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
    therefore he gives them good leave to wander.

  oliver. can you tell if rosalind, the duke's daughter, be banished
    with her father?

  charles. o, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,
    being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have
    followed her exile, or have died to stay behind her. she is at
    the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
    daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.

  oliver. where will the old duke live?

  charles. they say he is already in the forest of arden, and a many
    merry men with him; and there they live like the old robin hood

   of england. they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,
    and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.

  oliver. what, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?

  charles. marry, do i, sir; and i came to acquaint you with a
    matter. i am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger
    brother, orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
    me to try a fall. to-morrow, sir, i wrestle for my credit; and he
    that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
    your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, i would
    be loath to foil him, as i must, for my own honour, if he come
    in; therefore, out o

f my love to you, i came hither to acquaint
    you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,
    or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is
    thing of his own search and altogether against my will.

  oliver. charles, i thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt
    find i will most kindly requite. i had myself notice of my
    brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to
    dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. i'll tell thee,
    charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of france; full of
    ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret
    and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.
    therefore use thy discretion: i had as lief

or if he do not mightily grace
    himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap
    thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he
    hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, i
    assure thee, and almost with tears i speak it, there is not one
    so young and so villainous this day living. i speak but brotherly
    of him; but should i anatomize him to thee as he is, i must blush
    and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.

  charles. i am heartily glad i came hither to you. if he come
    to-morrow i'll give him his payment. if ever he go alone again,
    i'll never wrestle for prize more. and so, god keep your worship!

 exit

  oliver. farewell, good charles. now will i stir this gamester.
    i hope i shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet i know not why,
    hates nothing more than he. yet he's gentle; never school'd and
    yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly
    beloved; and, ind

you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and
    here, where you are, they are coming to perform it.

  celia. well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

  le beau. there comes an old man and his three sons-

  celia. i could match this beginning with an old tale.

  le beau. three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.

  rosalind. with bills on their necks: 'be it known unto all men by
    these presents'-

  le beau. the eldest of the three wrestled with charles, the duke's
    wrestler; which charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
    his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. so he serv'd
    the second, and so the third. yonder they lie; the poor old man,
    their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the
    beholders take his part with weeping.

  rosalind. alas!

  touchstone. but what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
    lost?

  le beau. why, this that i speak of.

  rosalind. but is there any else longs to see this broken music in
    his sides? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking?
    shall we see this wrestling, cousin?

  le beau. you must, if you stay here; for here is the place
    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.

  celia. yonder, sure, they are coming. let us now stay and see it.

  rosalind. is yonder the man?

  le beau. even he, madam.

  celia. alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.

  frederick. how now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither to
    see the wrestling?

  rosalind. ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.

  frederick. you will take little delight in it, i can tell you,

    there is such odds in the

  rosalind. young man, have you challeng'd charles the wrestler?

  orlando. no, fair princess; he is the general challenger. i come
    but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.

  celia. young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
    you have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw
    yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the
    fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal
    enterprise. we pray you, for your own sake, to embrace your own
