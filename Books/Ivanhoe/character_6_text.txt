well seconded by the exertions of the domestics, to silence this canine
clamour.

was so much appeased that the dependants could hear his voice. â€œsee what
tidings that horn tells us of--to announce, i ween, some hership [12]
and robbery which has been done upon my lands.â€

returning in less than three minutes, a warder announced â€œthat the prior
aymer of jorvaulx, and the good knight brian de bois-guilbert, commander
of the valiant and venerable order of knights templars, with a small
retinue, requested hospitality and lodging for the night, being on
their way to a tournament which was to be held not far from
ashby-de-la-zouche, on the second day from the present.â€

â€œaymer, the prior aymer? brian de bois-guilbert?â€--muttered cedric;
â€œnormans both;--but norman or saxon, the hospitality of rotherwood must
not be impeached; they are welcome, since they have chosen to halt--more

oswald made a respectful sign of assent. â€œhis brother sits in the

middleham; but what norman lord doth not the same? this prior is, they
say, a free and jovial priest, who loves the wine-cup and the bugle-horn
better than bell and book: good; let him come, he shall be welcome. how

â€œbrian de bois-guilbert.â€

â€œbois-guilbert,â€ said cedric, still in the musing, half-arguing tone,
which the habit of living among dependants had accustomed him to employ,
and which resembled a man who talks to himself rather than to those
around him--â€œbois-guilbert? that name has been spread wide both for
good and evil. they say he is valiant as the bravest of his order;
but stained with their usual vices, pride, arrogance, cruelty, and
voluptuousness; a hard-hearted man, who knows neither fear of earth,

a mute gesture of salutation, she moved gracefully forward to assume her

the prior, â€œi shall wear no collar of gold of yours at the tournament.
the chian wine is your own.â€

â€œsaid i not so?â€ answered the prior; â€œbut check your raptures, the
franklin observes you.â€

unheeding this remonstrance, and accustomed only to act upon the
immediate impulse of his own wishes, brian de bois-guilbert kept
his eyes riveted on the saxon beauty, more striking perhaps to his
imagination, because differing widely from those of the eastern
sultanas.

formed in the best proportions of her sex, rowena was tall in stature,
yet not so much so as to attract observation on account of superior
height. her complexion was exquisitely fair, but the noble cast of her
head and features prevented the insipidity which sometimes attaches
to fair beauties. her clear blue eye, which sat enshrined beneath a

â€œthe lady rowena,â€ said the prior, â€œhas punished us all, in chastising
the boldness of my friend. let me hope she will be less cruel to the
splendid train which are to meet at the tournament.â€

â€œour going thither,â€ said cedric, â€œis uncertain. i love not these
vanities, which were unknown to my fathers when england was free.â€

â€œlet us hope, nevertheless,â€ said the prior, â€œour company may determine
you to travel thitherward; when the roads are so unsafe, the escort of
sir brian de bois-guilbert is not to be despised.â€

â€œsir prior,â€ answered the saxon, â€œwheresoever i have travelled in this
land, i have hitherto found myself, with the assistance of my good sword
and faithful followers, in no respect needful of other aid. at present,
if we indeed journey to ashby-de-la-zouche, we do so with my noble
neighbour and countryman athelstane of coningsburgh, and with such a
train as would set outlaws and feudal enemies at defiance.--i drink

the holy land. i say besides, for i saw it, that king richard himself,
and five of his knights, held a tournament after the taking of st
john-de-acre, as challengers against all comers. i say that, on that
day, each knight ran three courses, and cast to the ground three
antagonists. i add, that seven of these assailants were knights of the
temple--and sir brian de bois-guilbert well knows the truth of what i
tell you.â€

it is impossible for language to describe the bitter scowl of rage
which rendered yet darker the swarthy countenance of the templar. in the
extremity of his resentment and confusion, his quivering fingers griped
towards the handle of his sword, and perhaps only withdrew, from the
consciousness that no act of violence could be safely executed in that
place and presence. cedric, whose feelings were all of a right onward
and simple kind, and were seldom

â€œthe sixth,â€ said the palmer, after a pause, in which he seemed to
recollect himself, â€œwas a young knight of lesser renown and lower rank,
assumed into that honourable company, less to aid their enterprise than
to make up their number--his name dwells not in my memory.â€

â€œsir palmer,â€ said sir brian de bois-guilbert scornfully, â€œthis assumed
forgetfulness, after so much has been remembered, comes too late to
serve your purpose. i will myself tell the name of the knight before
whose lance fortune and my horseâ€™s fault occasioned my falling--it was
the knight of ivanhoe; nor was there one of the six that, for his years,

any reverence for the alleged sanctity of the relic, took from his neck
a gold chain, which he flung on the board, saying--â€œlet prior aymer

triumph, and teach fair ladies to prize the love of valiant knights, who

â€œbois-guilbert,â€ answered de bracy, â€œis a good lance; but there are
others around these lists, sir prior, who will not fear to encounter
him.â€

at the champions choosing the arms of courtesy. for the same sort
of persons, who, in the present day, applaud most highly the deepest
tragedies, were then interested in a tournament exactly in proportion to
the danger incurred by the champions engaged.

having intimated their more pacific purpose, the champions retreated
to the extremity of the lists, where they remained drawn up in a line;
while the challengers, sallying each from his pavilion, mounted their
horses, and, headed by brian de bois-guilbert, descended from the
platform, and opposed themselves individually to the knights who had
touched their respective shields.

at the flourish of clarions and trumpets, they started out against
each other at full gallop; and such was the superior dexterity or
good fortune of the challengers, that those opposed to bois-guilbert,
malvoisin, and front-de-boeuf, rolled on the ground. the antagonist of

having expressed himself thus confidently, he reined his horse backward
down the slope which he had ascended, and compelled him in the same
manner to move backward through the lists, till he reached the
northern extremity, where he remained stationary, in expectation of his
antagonist. this feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause of
the multitude.

however incensed at his adversary for the precautions which he
recommended, brian de bois-guilbert did not neglect his advice; for
his honour was too nearly concerned, to permit his neglecting any means
which might ensure victory over his presumptuous opponent. he changed
his horse for a proved and fresh one of great strength and spirit. he
chose a new and a tough spear, lest the wood of the former might have
been strained in the previous encounters he had sustained. lastly,
he laid aside his shield, which had received some little damage, and
received another from his squires. his first had

the disinherited knight, therefore, stept boldly forth to the front of
his tent, and found in attendance the squires of the challengers, whom
he easily knew by their russet and black dresses, each of whom led
his masterâ€™s charger, loaded with the armour in which he had that day
fought.

â€œaccording to the laws of chivalry,â€ said the foremost of these men, â€œi,
baldwin de oyley, squire to the redoubted knight brian de bois-guilbert,
make offer to you, styling yourself, for the present, the disinherited
knight, of the horse and armour used by the said brian de bois-guilbert
in this dayâ€™s passage of arms, leaving it with your nobleness to retain
or to ransom the same, according to your pleasure; for such is the law
of arms.â€

the other squires repeated nearly the same formula, and then stood to
await the decision of the disinherited knight.

distribute one moiety among yourselves, sir squires, and divide the

the squires, with cap in hand, and low reverences, expressed their deep
sense of a courtesy and generosity not often practised, at least upon a
scale so extensive. the disinherited knight then addressed his discourse
to baldwin, the squire of brian de bois-guilbert. â€œfrom your master,â€
 said he, â€œi will accept neither arms nor ransom. say to him in my name,
that our strife is not ended--no, not till we have fought as well with
swords as with lances--as well on foot as on horseback. to this
mortal quarrel he has himself defied me, and i shall not forget the

â€œhow much is there?â€ demanded the robber.

â€œtwo hundred zecchins.â€

â€œonly two hundred zecchins!â€ said the bandit; â€œyour master hath dealt
liberally by the vanquished, and put them to a cheap ransom. name those

gurth did so.

courteous intercourse together.â€

word. â€œand what wert thou now doing at ashby with such a charge in thy

situation for viewing the continuation of the expected games.

the marshals and their attendants appeared next on the field, together
with the heralds, for the purpose of receiving the names of the knights
who intended to joust, with the side which each chose to espouse. this
was a necessary precaution, in order to secure equality betwixt the two
bodies who should be opposed to each other.

according to due formality, the disinherited knight was to be considered
as leader of the one body, while brian de bois-guilbert, who had been
rated as having done second-best in the preceding day, was named first
champion of the other band. those who had concurred in the challenge
adhered to his party of course, excepting only ralph de vipont, whom his
fall had rendered unfit so soon to put on his armour. there was no want
of distinguished and noble candidates to fill up the ranks on either
side.

at once, was more dangerous than single encounters, th

extricate themselves from the tumult. the mounted knights, whose lances
had been almost all broken by the fury of the encounter, were now
closely engaged with their swords, shouting their war-cries, and
exchanging buffets, as if honour and life depended on the issue of the
combat.

the tumult was presently increased by the advance of the second rank
on either side, which, acting as a reserve, now rushed on to aid their
companions. the followers of brian de bois-guilbert shouted--â€œha!
beau-seant! beau-seant! [20]

â€œ--for the temple--for the temple!â€ the opposite party shouted in
answer--â€œdesdichado! desdichado!â€--which watch-word they took from the
motto upon their leaderâ€™s shield.

with alternate success, the tide of battle seemed to flow now toward the
southern, now toward the northern extremity of the lists, as the one
or the other party prevailed. meantime the clang of the blow

nched from the hand of the bulky
saxon the battle-axe which he wielded, and, like one familiar with
the use of the weapon, bestowed him such a blow upon the crest, that
athelstane also lay senseless on the field. having achieved this double
feat, for which he was the more highly applauded that it was totally
unexpected from him, the knight seemed to resume the sluggishness of
his character, returning calmly to the northern extremity of the lists,
leaving his leader to cope as he best could with brian de bois-guilbert.
this was no longer matter of so much difficulty as formerly. the
templars horse had bled much, and gave way under the shock of the
disinherited knightâ€™s charge. brian de bois-guilbert rolled on the
field, encumbered with the stirrup, from which he was unable to draw his
foot. his antagonist sprung from horseback, waved his fatal sword over
the head of his adversary, and commanded him to yield himself; when

been by that o

aymer, â€œthe superior decency and decorum of their manners.â€

â€œby which they distinguished themselves at hastings and elsewhere.â€

while, with smooth and smiling cheek, the courtiers, each in turn,
followed their princeâ€™s example, and aimed a shaft of ridicule at
cedric, the face of the saxon became inflamed with passion, and
he glanced his eyes fiercely from one to another, as if the quick
succession of so many injuries had prevented his replying to them in
turn; or, like a baited bull, who, surrounded by his tormentors, is at

seconds,--â€œthe treasure shall be told down on this very floor.â€

â€œthy daughter!â€ said front-de-boeuf, as if surprised,--â€œby heavens,
isaac, i would i had known of this. i deemed that yonder black-browed
girl had been thy concubine, and i gave her to be a handmaiden to sir
brian de bois-guilbert, after the fashion of patriarchs and heroes of
the days of old, who set us in these matters a wholesome example.â€

the yell which isaac raised at this unfeeling communication made the
very vault to ring, and astounded the two saracens so much that they let
go their hold of the jew. he availed himself of his enlargement to throw
himself on the pavement, and clasp the knees of front-de-boeuf.

land uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken. thou art no outlaw, but

dropping the mantle from his face, â€œart no true daughter of israel,

to hang thy neck and arms with pearls and diamonds, which so well become
them, than to deprive thee of these ornaments.â€

devoted to the lady of his love than brian de bois-guilbert. she, the

â€œsafe thou art,â€ replied de bracy; â€œand for christianity, here is the

and the good knight templar, brian de bois-guilbert, whose trade is to
slay saracens--if these are not good marks of christianity, i know no
other which they bear about them.â€

â€œye are friends and allies of our reverend father in god, aymer, prior
of jorvaulx,â€ said the monk, without noticing the tone of de bracyâ€™s
reply; â€œye owe him aid both by knightly faith and holy charity; for what

the apprehensions of isaac, however, were not ill founded; and the
generous and grateful benevolence of his daughter exposed her, on her
return to ashby, to the unhallowed gaze of brian de bois-guilbert. the
templar twice passed and repassed them on the road, fixing his bold
and ardent look on the beautiful jewess; and we have already seen the
consequences of the admiration which her charms excited when accident
threw her into the power of that unprincipled voluptuary.

them, tempering all to that pitch of courage which was necessary in
making an open declaration of their purpose. but their enterprise was
delayed by the absence of more than one main limb of the confederacy.
the stubborn and daring, though brutal courage of front-de-boeuf; the
buoyant spirits and bold bearing of de bracy; the sagacity, martial
experience, and renowned valour of brian de bois-guilbert, were
important to the success of their conspiracy; and, while cursing in
secret their unnecessary and unmeaning absence, neither john nor his
adviser dared to proceed without them. isaac the jew also seemed to have
vanished, and with him the hope of certain sums of money, making up the
subsidy for which prince john had contracted with that israelite and his
brethren. this deficiency was likely to prove perilous in an emergency
so critical.

he then explained to nathan the pressing cause of his journey. the rabbi
listened with interest, and testified his sympathy after the fashion of
his people, rending his clothes, and saying, â€œah, my daughter!--ah, my
daughter!--alas! for the beauty of zion!--alas! for the captivity of
israel!â€

â€œthou seest,â€ said isaac, â€œhow it stands with me, and that i may not

he doth meditate, and that he may deliver to me my beloved daughter

â€œis it not more seemly,â€ said the grand master, â€œto see this damian,
clothed in the garments of christian humility, thus appear with reverend
silence before his superior, than but two days since, when the fond fool
was decked in a painted coat, and jangling as pert and as proud as any
popinjay?--speak, damian, we permit thee--what is thine errand?â€

â€œa jew stands without the gate, noble and reverend father,â€ said the
squire, â€œwho prays to speak with brother brian de bois-guilbert.â€

â€œthou wert right to give me knowledge of it,â€ said the grand master; â€œin
our presence a preceptor is but as a common compeer of our order, who
may not walk according to his own will, but to that of his master--even
according to the text, â€˜in the hearing of the ear he hath obeyed
me.â€™--it imports us especially to know of this bois-guilbertâ€™s
proceedings,â€ said he, turning to his companion.

isaac gasped with terror and uncertainty. to tell his tale might be
interpreted into scandalizing the order; yet, unless he told it, what
hope could he have of achieving his daughterâ€™s deliverance? beaumanoir
saw his mortal apprehension, and condescended to give him some
assurance.

â€œfear nothing,â€ he said, â€œfor thy wretched person, jew, so thou dealest
uprightly in this matter. i demand again to know from thee thy business
with brian de bois-guilbert?â€

â€œi am bearer of a letter,â€ stammered out the jew, â€œso please your

no more fitting messenger than an unbelieving jew.--give me the letter.â€

concerning it.â€

conrade read the letter, which was in these words: â€œaymer, by divine
grace, prior of the cistertian house of saint maryâ€™s of jorvaulx, to
sir brian de bois-guilbert, a knight of the holy order of the temple,
wisheth health, with the bounties of king bacchus and of my lady venus.

our person, and put us to ransom; whereby we have also learned of

jewish sorceress, whose black eyes have bewitched thee. we are heartily

men towards those whom they loved â€˜par amoursâ€™; but the explanation did
not satisfy the bigoted beaumanoir.

â€œthere is more in it than thou dost guess, conrade; thy simplicity is
no match for this deep abyss of wickedness. this rebecca of york was a
pupil of that miriam of whom thou hast heard. thou shalt hear the jew

â€œay, reverend valorous sir,â€ stammered poor isaac, â€œand whatsoever
ransom a poor man may pay for her deliverance---â€

â€œpeace!â€ said the grand master. â€œthis thy daughter hath practised the
art of healing, hath she not?â€

â€œay, gracious sir,â€ answered the jew, with more confidence; â€œand knight

albert malvoisin, president, or, in the language of the order, preceptor
of the establishment of templestowe, was brother to that philip
malvoisin who has been already occasionally mentioned in this history,
and was, like that baron, in close league with brian de bois-guilbert.

amongst dissolute and unprincipled men, of whom the temple order
included but too many, albert of templestowe might be distinguished; but
with this difference from the audacious bois-guilbert, that he knew how
to throw over his vices and his ambition the veil of hypocrisy, and to
assume in his exterior the fanaticism which he internally despised.
had not the arrival of the grand master been so unexpectedly sudden,
he would have seen nothing at templestowe which might have appeared to

â€œay, brother, a jewish sorceress!â€ said the grand master, sternly. â€œi
have said it. darest thou deny that this rebecca, the daughter of that
wretched usurer isaac of york, and the pupil of the foul witch
miriam, is now--shame to be thought or spoken!--lodged within this thy
preceptory?â€

â€œyour wisdom, reverend father,â€ answered the preceptor, â€œhath rolled
away the darkness from my understanding. much did i wonder that so good
a knight as brian de bois-guilbert seemed so fondly besotted on the
charms of this female, whom i received into this house merely to place a
bar betwixt their growing intimacy, which else might have been cemented
at the expense of the fall of our valiant and religious brother.â€

â€œhath nothing, then, as yet passed betwixt them in breach of his vow?â€
 demanded the grand master.

â€œwhat! under this roof?â€ said the preceptor, crossing himself; â€œsaint
magdalene and the ten thousand virgins forbid!--no! if i have sinned in

ch was begun by idleness and folly. it may be that our brother
bois-guilbert does in this matter deserve rather pity than severe
chastisement; rather the support of the staff, than the strokes of the
rod; and that our admonitions and prayers may turn him from his folly,
and restore him to his brethren.â€

â€œit were deep pity,â€ said conrade mont-fitchet, â€œto lose to the order
one of its best lances, when the holy community most requires the aid of
its sons. three hundred saracens hath this brian de bois-guilbert slain
with his own hand.â€

â€œthe blood of these accursed dogs,â€ said the grand master, â€œshall be a
sweet and acceptable offering to the saints and angels whom they despise
and blaspheme; and with their aid will we counteract the spells and
charms with which our brother is entwined as in a net. he shall burst
the bands of this delilah, as sampson burst the two new cords with which
the philistines had bound him, and shall slaughter the infidels, even
heaps upon heaps. but concerning this f

and shall that power be denied to the grand master of the temple within
a preceptory of his order?--no!--we will judge and condemn. the witch
shall be taken out of the land, and the wickedness thereof shall be
forgiven. prepare the castle-hall for the trial of the sorceress.â€

albert malvoisin bowed and retired,--not to give directions for
preparing the hall, but to seek out brian de bois-guilbert, and
communicate to him how matters were likely to terminate. it was not
long ere he found him, foaming with indignation at a repulse he had
anew sustained from the fair jewess. â€œthe unthinking,â€ he said, â€œthe
ungrateful, to scorn him who, amidst blood and flames, would have saved
her life at the risk of his own! by heaven, malvoisin! i abode until

and must exchange all thy brilliant visions of ambition and power, to

flanders and burgundy.â€

â€œthou speakest the truth, malvoisin,â€ said brian de bois-guilbert, after
a momentâ€™s reflection. â€œi will give the hoary bigot no advantage over
me; and for rebecca, she hath not merited at my hand that i should
expose rank and honour for her sake. i will cast her off--yes, i will

the necessary orders, when he was joined
by conrade mont-fitchet, who acquainted him with the grand masterâ€™s
resolution to bring the jewess to instant trial for sorcery.

â€œit is surely a dream,â€ said the preceptor; â€œwe have many jewish
physicians, and we call them not wizards though they work wonderful
cures.â€

â€œthe grand master thinks otherwise,â€ said mont-fitchet; â€œand, albert,
i will be upright with thee--wizard or not, it were better that this
miserable damsel die, than that brian de bois-guilbert should be lost to
the order, or the order divided by internal dissension. thou knowest his
high rank, his fame in arms--thou knowest the zeal with which many of
our brethren regard him--but all this will not avail him with our grand
master, should he consider brian as the accomplice, not the victim, of
this jewess. were the souls of the twelve tribes in her single body, it
were better she suffered alone, than that bois-guilbert were partner in
her destruction.â€

appropriate to introduce the approaching triumph, for such he deemed
it, over the powers of darkness. the deep prolonged notes, raised by
a hundred masculine voices accustomed to combine in the choral chant,
arose to the vaulted roof of the hall, and rolled on amongst its arches
with the pleasing yet solemn sound of the rushing of mighty waters.

when the sounds ceased, the grand master glanced his eye slowly around
the circle, and observed that the seat of one of the preceptors was
vacant. brian de bois-guilbert, by whom it had been occupied, had left
his place, and was now standing near the extreme corner of one of the
benches occupied by the knights companions of the temple, one hand
extending his long mantle, so as in some degree to hide his face;
while the other held his cross-handled sword, with the point of which,
sheathed as it was, he was slowly drawing lines upon the oaken floor.

â€œunhappy man!â€ said the grand master, after favouring him with a glance
of compassion. â€œthou seest, conrade,

herman of goodalricke was the fourth preceptor present; the other
three were conrade, malvoisin, and bois-guilbert himself. herman was an
ancient warrior, whose face was marked with scars inflicted by the
sabre of the moslemah, and had great rank and consideration among his
brethren. he arose and bowed to the grand master, who instantly granted
him license of speech. â€œi would crave to know, most reverend father,
of our valiant brother, brian de bois-guilbert, what he says to these
wondrous accusations, and with what eye he himself now regards his
unhappy intercourse with this jewish maiden?â€

â€œbrian de bois-guilbert,â€ said the grand master, â€œthou hearest the
question which our brother of goodalricke desirest thou shouldst answer.
i command thee to reply to him.â€

bois-guilbert turned his head towards the grand master when thus
addressed, and remained silent.

â€œhe is possessed by a dumb devil,â€ said the grand master. â€œavoid thee,

bois-guilbert made an effort to suppress his rising scorn and
indignation, the expression of which, he was well aware, would have
little availed him. â€œbrian de bois-guilbert,â€ he answered, â€œreplies not,
most reverend father, to such wild and vague charges. if his honour be
impeached, he will defend it with his body, and with that sword which
has often fought for christendom.â€

â€œwe forgive thee, brother brian,â€ said the grand master; â€œthough that

thine own deeds, and cometh of the enemy, who tempteth us to exalt our

n, and shame it were to us upon any pretence, to
refuse proffered combat. thus, therefore, stands the case. rebecca,
the daughter of isaac of york, is, by many frequent and suspicious
circumstances, defamed of sorcery practised on the person of a noble
knight of our holy order, and hath challenged the combat in proof of her
innocence. to whom, reverend brethren, is it your opinion that we should
deliver the gage of battle, naming him, at the same time, to be our
champion on the field?â€

â€œto brian de bois-guilbert, whom it chiefly concerns,â€ said the
preceptor of goodalricke, â€œand who, moreover, best knows how the truth
stands in this matter.â€

â€œbut if,â€ said the grand master, â€œour brother brian be under the
influence of a charm or a spell--we speak but for the sake of
precaution, for to the arm of none of our holy order would we more
willingly confide this or a more weighty cause.â€

â€œreverend father,â€ answered the preceptor of goodalricke, â€œno spell can

â€œthou sayest right, brother,â€ said the grand master. â€œalbert malvoisin,

thee, brother,â€ he continued, addressing himself to bois-guilbert, â€œthat
thou do thy battle manfully, nothing doubting that the good cause shall
triumph.--and do thou, rebecca, attend, that we assign thee the third
day from the present to find a champion.â€

â€œthat is but brief space,â€ answered rebecca, â€œfor a stranger, who is
also of another faith, to find one who will do battle, wagering life

being unable to combat in her own behalf, she doth offer, by a champion
instead thereof, to avouch her case, he performing his loyal â€˜devoirâ€™ in
all knightly sort, with such arms as to gage of battle do fully
appertain, and that at her peril and cost. and therewith she proffered
her gage. and the gage having been delivered to the noble lord and
knight, brian de bois-guilbert, of the holy order of the temple of zion,
he was appointed to do this battle, in behalf of his order and himself,
as injured and impaired by the practices of the appellant. wherefore the
most reverend father and puissant lord, lucas marquis of beaumanoir, did
allow of the said challenge, and of the said â€˜essoineâ€™ of the
appellantâ€™s body, and assigned the third day for the said combat, the
place being the enclosure called the lists of saint george, near to the
preceptory of templestowe. an

when the sounds of rebeccaâ€™s devotional hymn had died away in silence,
the low knock at the door was again renewed. â€œenter,â€ she said, â€œif
thou art a friend; and if a foe, i have not the means of refusing thy
entrance.â€

â€œi am,â€ said brian de bois-guilbert, entering the apartment, â€œfriend or
foe, rebecca, as the event of this interview shall make me.â€

alarmed at the sight of this man, whose licentious passion she
considered as the root of her misfortunes, rebecca drew backward with
a cautious and alarmed, yet not a timorous demeanour, into the farthest
corner of the apartment, as if determined to retreat as far as she
could, but to stand her ground when retreat became no longer possible.
she drew herself into an attitude not of defiance, but

lled with awe the hearts of the assembled
multitude, whose eyes were now turned to the preceptory, expecting the
approach of the grand master, the champion, and the criminal.

at length the drawbridge fell, the gates opened, and a knight, bearing
the great standard of the order, sallied from the castle, preceded by
six trumpets, and followed by the knights preceptors, two and two, the
grand master coming last, mounted on a stately horse, whose furniture
was of the simplest kind. behind him came brian de bois-guilbert, armed
cap-a-pie in bright armour, but without his lance, shield, and sword,
which were borne by his two esquires behind him. his face, though partly
hidden by a long plume which floated down from his barrel-cap, bore
a strong and mingled expression of passion, in which pride seemed to
contend with irresolution. he looked ghastly pale, as if he had not
slept for several nights, yet reined his pawing war-horse with the
habitual ease and grace proper to the best lance of the order of the
temple.

her head.

meanwhile, the grand master had assumed his seat; and when the chivalry
of his order was placed around and behind him, each in his due rank,
a loud and long flourish of the trumpets announced that the court
were seated for judgment. malvoisin, then, acting as godfather of the
champion, stepped forward, and laid the glove of the jewess, which was
the pledge of battle, at the feet of the grand master.

â€œvalorous lord, and reverend father,â€ said he, â€œhere standeth the good
knight, brian de bois-guilbert, knight preceptor of the order of the
temple, who, by accepting the pledge of battle which i now lay at your
reverenceâ€™s feet, hath become bound to do his devoir in combat this
day, to maintain that this jewish maiden, by name rebecca, hath justly
deserved the doom passed upon her in a chapter of this most holy order
of the temple of zion, condemning her to die as a sorceress;--here, i
say, he standeth, such battle to do, knightly and honourable, if such be
your noble and sanctified pleasure.

x and the â€˜te igiturâ€™.â€

â€œsir, and most reverend father,â€ answered malvoisin, readily, â€œour
brother here present hath already sworn to the truth of his accusation
in the hand of the good knight conrade de mont-fitchet; and otherwise he
ought not to be sworn, seeing that his adversary is an unbeliever, and
may take no oath.â€

this explanation was satisfactory, to albertâ€™s great joy; for the wily
knight had foreseen the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of
prevailing upon brian de bois-guilbert to take such an oath before the
assembly, and had invented this excuse to escape the necessity of his
doing so.

the grand master, having allowed the apology of albert malvoisin,
commanded the herald to stand forth and do his devoir. the trumpets
then again flourished, and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed
aloud,--â€œoyez, oyez, oyez.--here standeth the good knight, sir brian

himself in the saddle.

to the summons of the herald, who demanded his rank, his name, and
purpose, the stranger knight answered readily and boldly, â€œi am a good
knight and noble, come hither to sustain with lance and sword the just
and lawful quarrel of this damsel, rebecca, daughter of isaac of york;
to uphold the doom pronounced against her to be false and truthless, and
to defy sir brian de bois-guilbert, as a traitor, murderer, and liar; as
i will prove in this field with my body against his, by the aid of god,
of our lady, and of monseigneur saint george, the good knight.â€

â€œthe stranger must first show,â€ said malvoisin, â€œthat he is good knight,
and of honourable lineage. the temple sendeth not forth her champions
against nameless men.â€

note b.--negro slaves.

the severe accuracy of some critics has objected to the complexion of
the slaves of brian de bois-guilbert, as being totally out of costume
and propriety. i remember the same objection being made to a set of
sable functionaries, whom my friend, mat lewis, introduced as the
guards and mischief-doing satellites of the wicked baron, in his castle
spectre. mat treated the objection with great contempt, and averred
in reply, that he made the slaves black in order to obtain a striking
effect of contrast, and that, could he have derived a similar advantage
from making his heroine blue, blue she should have
