“were you in italy?” 
“in sicily, about the time this happened. all through the time we came up the adriatic behind the troops i thought of it. i had 
continued conversations with the child. i worked very hard in the hospitals and retreated from everybody around me. except 
the child, who i shared everything with. in my head. i was talking to him while i bathed and nursed patients. i  was a little 
crazy.” 

“and then your father died.” 
“yes. then patrick died. i was in pisa when i heard.” 
she was awake. sitting up. 
“you knew, huh?” 
“i got a letter from home.” 
“is that why you came here, because you knew?” 
“no.” 
“good. i don’t think that  he  believed in  wakes and such things. patrick  used to say  he  wanted a duet by two  women on 

musical instruments when he died. squeeze-box and violin. that’s all. he was so damn sentimental.” 

“yes. you could really make him do anything. find him a woman in distress and

if  falling  into  the  arms  of  a  stranger  you  discover  the  mirror  of  your  choice.  unlike  the  sapper,  her  father  was  never  fully

mother had complained, you lost two or three crucial words. but hana liked that about him, there seemed to be no feudal 
spirit around him. he had a vagueness, an uncertainty that allowed him tentative charm. he was unlike most men. even the 
wounded english patient had the familiar purpose of the feudal. but her father was a hungry ghost, liking those around him to 
be confident, even raucous.

patient  recommended,  and  that  was  the  way  she  remembered  her  father—whenever  she  collected  the  moments  of  him—
stopping his car under one specific bridge in toronto north of pottery road at midnight and telling her that this was where the 
starlings and pigeons  uncomfortably and not  too happily  shared the rafters during the  night. so they  had paused there on a 
summer night and leaned their heads out into the racket of noise and sleepy chirpings. 

i was told patrick died in a dove-cot, caravaggio said. 
her father loved a city of his own invention, whose streets and walls and borders he and his friends had painted. he never 
truly  stepped  out  of  that  world.  she  realizes  everything  she  knew  about  the  real  world  she  learned  on  her  own  or  from 
caravaggio  or,  during  the  time  they  lived  together,  from  her  stepmother,  clara.  clara,  who  had  once  been  an  actress,  the 
articulate one,  who  had articulated fury  when they al

written on a pink rock on an island in georgian bay, written with the wind coming 
over the  water and curling the paper of her notebook before she finally tore the pages  out and put them in an envelope for 
hana. she carried them in her suitcase, each containing a flake of pink rock and that wind. but she has never answered them. 
she has missed clara with a woe but is unable to write to her, now, after all that has happened to her. she cannot bear to talk of 
or even acknowledge the death of patrick. 

and now, on this continent, the  war having travelled elsewhere, the  nunneries and churches that  were turned briefly into 
hospitals are solitary, cut off in the hills of tuscany and umbria. they hold the remnants of war societies, small moraines left 
by a vast glacier. all around them now is the holy forest. 

she tucks her feet under her thin frock and rests her arms along her thighs. everything is still. she hears the familiar hollow 
churn, restless in the pipe that is buried in the c

dy, a khaki wing he folds over 
himself during the night. it is his world. she feels displaced out of canada during these nights. he asks her why she cannot 
sleep. she lies there irritated at his self-sufficiency, his ability to turn so easily away from the world. she wants a tin roof for 
the rain, two poplar trees to shiver outside her window, a noise she can sleep against, sleeping trees and sleeping roofs that she 
grew up with in the east end of toronto and then for a couple of years with patrick and clara along the skootamatta river and 
later georgian bay. she has not found a sleeping tree, even in the density of this garden. 

“kiss  me.  it’s  your  mouth  i’m  most  purely  in  love  with.  your  teeth.”  and  later,  when  his  head  has  fallen  to  one  side, 
towards the air by the tent’s opening, she has whispered aloud, heard only by herself, “perhaps we should ask caravaggio. my 
father told me once that caravaggio was a man always in love. not just in love but a

“i thought so. kip and i are both sure he is english. kip thinks the best people are eccentrics, he worked with one.” 
“i think kip is the eccentric myself. where is he, anyway?” 
“he’s plotting something on the terrace, doesn’t want me out there. something for my birthday.” hana stood up from her 

crouch at the grate, wiping her hand on the opposite forearm. 

“for your birthday i’m going to tell you a small story,” he said. 
she looked at him. 
“not about patrick, okay?” 
“a little about patrick, mostly about you.” 
“i still can’t listen to those stories, david.” 
“fathers die. you keep on loving them in any way you can. you can’t hide him away in your heart.” 
“talk to me when the morphia wears off.” 
she came up to him and put her arms around him, reached up and kissed his cheek. his embrace tightened around her, his 
stubble like sand against her skin. she loved that about him now; in the past he had always been meticulous. the

parting in his 
hair like yonge street at midnight, patrick had said. caravaggio had in the past moved like a god in her presence. now, with 
his face and his trunk filled out and this greyness in him, he was a friendlier human. 

 
tonight dinner was being prepared by the sapper. caravaggio was not looking forward to it. one meal in three was a loss as 
far as he was concerned. kip found vegetables and presented them barely cooked, just briefly boiled into a soup. it was to be 
another purist meal, not what caravaggio wished for after a day such as thi

evasive, veering caravaggio away from stories that involved some moment of her life. she wanted kip to know her only in the 
present, a person perhaps more flawed or more compassionate or harder or more obsessed than the girl or young woman she 
 

 
had  been  then.  in  her  life  there  was  her  mother  alice  her  father  patrick  her  stepmother  clara  and  caravaggio.  she  had 
already admitted these names to kip as if they were her credentials, her dowry. they were faultless and needed no discussion. 
she used them like authorities in a book she could refer to on the right way to boil an egg, or the correct way to slip garlic into 
a lamb. they were not to be questioned.

and now—because he was quite drunk—caravaggio told the story of hana’s singing the “marseillaise,” which he had told 
her before.

the year is 194-. what? for a second i forget. but i know the month and the day. one day after we heard the bombs were 

dropped  in  japan,  so  it  feels  like  the  end  of  the  world.  from  now  on  i  believe  the  personal  will  forever  be  at  war  with  the

patrick died in a dove-cot in france. in france in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they built them huge, larger than 

most houses. like this. 

 

the horizontal line one-third of the way down was called the rat ledge—to stop rats running up the brick, so the doves would 
be  safe. safe as  a dove-cot. a  sacred  place.  like  a  church  in  many  ways. a  comforting  place.  patrick died  in  a  comforting 
place.

from him, from whatever was machine and mortal, part of the element of air. 

the motorbike and the soldier stilled in midair, then pivoted down into the water, the metal body between his legs as they 
slammed into it, jarring a white path through it, disappearing, the rain too entering the river. “he will toss thee like a ball into a 
large country.” 

 
how did patrick end up in a dove-cot, clara? his unit had left him, burned and wounded. so burned the buttons of his shirt 

were part of his skin, part of his dear chest. that i kissed 

and you kissed. and how was my father burned? he who could swerve like an eel, or like your canoe, as if charmed, from 
the real world. in his sweet and complicated innocence. he was the most unverbal of men, and i am always surprised women 
liked  him.  we  tend  to  like  a  verbal  man  around  us.  we  are  the  rationali
