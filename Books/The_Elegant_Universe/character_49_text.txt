ss closely akin to radioactive
decay, in an average of about two millionths of a second. this disintegration is an experimental fact
supported by an enormous amount of evidence. it's as if a muon lives its life with a gun to its head;
when  it  reaches  two  millionths  of  a  second  in  age,  it  pulls  the  trigger  and  explodes  apart  into
electrons and neutrinos. but if these muons are not sitting at rest in the laboratory and instead are
traveling through a piece of equipment known as a particle accelerator that boosts them to just shy of
light-speed,  their  average  life  expectancy  as  measured  by  scientists  in  the  laboratory  increases
dramatically. this really happens. at 667 million miles per hour (about 99.5 percent of light speed),
the muon lifetime is seen to increase by a factor of about ten. the explanation, according to special
relativity, is that "wristwatches" worn by the muons tick much more slowly than the clocks in the
laboratory, so long after the laboratory clocks say that

ory is right, each of the infinitely many resonant patterns of string
vibration should correspond to an elementary particle. an essential point, however, is that the high
string tension ensures that all but a few of these vibrational patterns will correspond to extremely
heavy particles (the few being the lowest-energy vibrations that have near-perfect cancellations with
quantum string jitters). and again, the term "heavy" here means many times heavier than the planck
mass. as our most powerful particle accelerators can reach energies only on the order of a thousand
times the proton mass, less than a millionth of a billionth of the planck energy, we are very far from
being able to search in the laboratory for any of these new particles predicted by string theory.

there are more indirect approaches by which we could search for them, though. for instance,
the  energies  involved  at  the  birth  of  the  universe  would  have  been  high  enough  to  produce  these
particles copiously. in general one would

superstring  revolution  (discussed  in  chapter
12),  witten  and,  most  notably,  joe  lykken  of  the  fermi  national  accelerator  laboratory  have
identified a subtle, yet possible, loophole in this conclusion. lykken, exploiting this realization, has
suggested  that  it  might  be  possible  for  strings  to  be  under  far  less  tension,  and  therefore  be
substantially larger in size, than originally thought. so large, in fact, that they might be observable by
the next generation of particle accelerators. if this long-shot possibility turns out to be the case, there
is the exciting prospect that many of the remarkable implications of string theory discussed in this and
the following chapters will be verifiable experimentally within the next decade. but even in the more

"conventional" scenario espoused by string theorists, in which strings are typically on the order of 10-
33 centimeters in length, there are indirect ways to search for them experimentally, as we will discuss
in chapter 9.
