Oedipus - 
                	The
protagonist of Oedipus the King and Oedipus
at Colonus. Oedipus becomes king of Thebes before the action
of Oedipus the King begins. He is renowned for his
intelligence and his ability to solve riddles--he saved the city
of Thebes and was made its king by solving the riddle of the Sphinx,
the supernatural being that had held the city captive. Yet Oedipus
is stubbornly blind to the truth about himself. His name's literal
meaning ("swollen foot") is the clue to his identity--he was taken
from the house of Laius as a baby and left in the mountains with
his feet bound together. On his way to Thebes, he killed his biological father,
not knowing who he was, and proceeded to marry Jocasta, his biological
mother.
