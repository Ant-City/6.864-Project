t. his soul was at
peace, now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his
black thread and getting him into trouble.

tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the
back of his auntï¿½s cow-stable. he presently got safely beyond the reach
of capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the
village, where two ï¿½militaryï¿½ companies of boys had met for conflict,
according to previous appointment. tom was general of one of these
armies, joe harper (a bosom friend) general of the other. these two
great commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being better
suited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence
and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
aides-de-camp. tomï¿½s army won a great victory, after a long and
hard-fought battle. then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,
the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the
necessary battle appointed; after which the a

fetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the

midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when itï¿½s
midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you canï¿½t see

the percussion-cap box came out. he released the tick and put him on
the long flat desk. the creature probably glowed with a gratitude that
amounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when
he started thankfully to travel off, tom turned him aside with a pin and
made him take a new direction.

tomï¿½s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as tom had been, and
now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in
an instant. this bosom friend was joe harper. the two boys were sworn
friends all the week, and embattled enemies on saturdays. joe took a
pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.
the sport grew in interest momently. soon tom said that they were
interfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit
of the tick. so he put joeï¿½s slate on the desk and drew a line down the
middle of it from top to bottom.

ï¿½now,ï¿½ said he, ï¿½as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and
iï¿½ll let him a

possession. at last tom could stand it no longer. the temptation was too
strong. so he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. joe was angry in
a moment. said he:

ï¿½tom, you let him alone.ï¿½

ï¿½i only just want to stir him up a little, joe.ï¿½

ï¿½no, sir, it ainï¿½t fair; you just let him alone.ï¿½

ï¿½blame it, i ainï¿½t going to stir him much.ï¿½

ï¿½let him alone, i tell you.ï¿½

ï¿½i wonï¿½t!ï¿½

ï¿½you shall--heï¿½s on my side of the line.ï¿½

ï¿½look here, joe harper, whose is that tick?ï¿½

ï¿½i donï¿½t care whose tick he is--heï¿½s on my side of the line, and you
shaï¿½nï¿½t touch him.ï¿½

ï¿½well, iï¿½ll just bet i will, though. heï¿½s my tick and iï¿½ll do what i
blame please with him, or die!ï¿½

a tremendous whack came down on tomï¿½s shoulders, and its duplicate on
joeï¿½s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from
the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. the boys had been
too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen

ff his jacket and trousers, turned
a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,
disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and
in a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,
with fluttering shirt. he presently halted under a great elm, blew an
answering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way
and that. he said cautiously--to an imaginary company:

ï¿½hold, my merry men! keep hid till i blow.ï¿½

now appeared joe harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as tom.
tom called:

ï¿½hold! who comes here into sherwood forest without my pass?ï¿½

ï¿½guy of guisborne wants no manï¿½s pass. who art thou that--that--ï¿½

ï¿½dares to hold such language,ï¿½ said tom, prompting--for they talked ï¿½by
the book,ï¿½ from memory.

ï¿½who art thou that dares to hold such language?ï¿½

ï¿½then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? right gladly will i dis

rse than a thousand whippings, and tomï¿½s heart was sorer now
than his body. he cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform
over and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that
he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble
confidence.

he left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward
sid; and so the latterï¿½s prompt retreat through the back gate was
unnecessary. he moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,
along with joe harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the
air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
trifles. then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his
desk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony
stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.
his elbow was pressing against some hard substance. after a long time
he slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with
a sigh. it was in a paper. he unrol

undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting-place. it was starlight, and very still. the mighty river lay
like an ocean at rest. tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the
quiet. then he gave a low, distinct whistle. it was answered from under
the bluff. tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the
same way. then a guarded voice said:

ï¿½who goes there?ï¿½

ï¿½tom sawyer, the black avenger of the spanish main. name your names.ï¿½

ï¿½huck finn the red-handed, and joe harper the terror of the seas.ï¿½ tom
had furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.

ï¿½ï¿½tis well. give the countersign.ï¿½

two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
brooding night:

ï¿½_blood_!ï¿½

then tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. there was
an easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked
the advantages of difficulty and danger so value

uccess, for he knew it was the boatï¿½s last trip for the night. at
the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and
tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards
downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.

he flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
auntï¿½s back fence. he climbed over, approached the ï¿½ell,ï¿½ and looked
in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. there
sat aunt polly, sid, mary, and joe harperï¿½s mother, grouped together,
talking. they were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the
door. tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then
he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing
cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might
squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,
warily.

ï¿½what makes the candle blow so?ï¿½ said aunt polly. tom hurried up. ï¿½why,
that doorï¿½s open, i believe. why, of

½i wish now iï¿½d thought,ï¿½ said tom, with a repentant tone; ï¿½but i dreamt
about you, anyway. thatï¿½s something, ainï¿½t it?ï¿½

ï¿½it ainï¿½t much--a cat does that much--but itï¿½s better than nothing. what
did you dream?ï¿½

ï¿½why, wednesday night i dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
bed, and sid was sitting by the woodbox, and mary next to him.ï¿½

ï¿½well, so we did. so we always do. iï¿½m glad your dreams could take even
that much trouble about us.ï¿½

ï¿½and i dreamt that joe harperï¿½s mother was here.ï¿½

ï¿½why, she was here! did you dream any more?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, lots. but itï¿½s so dim, now.ï¿½

ï¿½well, try to recollect--canï¿½t you?ï¿½

ï¿½somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--ï¿½

ï¿½try harder, tom! the wind did blow something. come!ï¿½

tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then
said:

ï¿½iï¿½ve got it now! iï¿½ve got it now! it blowed the candle!ï¿½

ï¿½mercy on us! go on, tom--go on!ï¿½

as a free boy again,
however--there was something in that. he could drink and swear, now--but
found to his surprise that he did not want to. the simple fact that he
could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.

tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning
to hang a little heavily on his hands.

he attempted a diary--but nothing happened during three days, and so he
abandoned it.

the first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a
sensation. tom and joe harper got up a band of performers and were happy
for two days.

even the glorious fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained
hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man
in the world (as tom supposed), mr. benton, an actual united states
senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment--for he was not
twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.

a circus came. the boys played circus for three days afterward in tents
made of rag carpeting--admission,

 wait--for there might not be any more storms.

the next day the doctors were back; tom had relapsed. the three weeks he
spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. when he got abroad
at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how
lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. he drifted
listlessly down the street and found jim hollis acting as judge in a
juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her
victim, a bird. he found joe harper and huck finn up an alley eating a
stolen melon. poor lads! they--like tom--had suffered a relapse.




chapter xxiii

at last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred--and vigorously: the murder
trial came on in the court. it became the absorbing topic of village
talk immediately. tom could not get away from it. every reference to
the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience
and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in
his hearing as ï¿½feelersï¿½; he did

at is to say, he ï¿½found a clew.ï¿½ but you canï¿½t
hang a ï¿½clewï¿½ for murder, and so after that detective had got through
and gone home, tom felt just as insecure as he was before.

the slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
weight of apprehension.




chapter xxv

there comes a time in every rightly-constructed boyï¿½s life when he has
a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. this desire
suddenly came upon tom one day. he sallied out to find joe harper,
but failed of success. next he sought ben rogers; he had gone fishing.
presently he stumbled upon huck finn the red-handed. huck would
answer. tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him
confidentially. huck was willing. huck was always willing to take a hand
in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,
for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is
not money. ï¿½whereï¿½ll we dig?ï¿½ said huck.

ï¿½oh, most anywhere.ï¿½

the fun; mary remained at home to entertain him. the last thing mrs.
thatcher said to becky, was:

ï¿½youï¿½ll not get back till late. perhaps youï¿½d better stay all night with
some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.ï¿½

ï¿½then iï¿½ll stay with susy harper, mamma.ï¿½

ï¿½very well. and mind and behave yourself and donï¿½t be any trouble.ï¿½

presently, as they tripped along, tom said to becky:

ï¿½say--iï¿½ll tell you what weï¿½ll do. ï¿½stead of going to joe harperï¿½s weï¿½ll
climb right up the hill and stop at the widow douglasï¿½. sheï¿½ll have
ice-cream! she has it most every day--dead loads of it. and sheï¿½ll be
awful glad to have us.ï¿½

ï¿½oh, that will be fun!ï¿½

then becky reflected a moment and said:

ï¿½but what will mamma say?ï¿½

ï¿½howï¿½ll she ever know?ï¿½

the girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:

ï¿½i reckon itï¿½s wrong--but--ï¿½

ï¿½but shucks! your mother wonï¿½t know, and so whatï¿½s the harm? all she

talking briskly with a friend, passed by. aunt polly said:

ï¿½goodmorning, mrs. thatcher. goodmorning, mrs. harper. iï¿½ve got a boy
thatï¿½s turned up missing. i reckon my tom stayed at your house last
night--one of you. and now heï¿½s afraid to come to church. iï¿½ve got to
settle with him.ï¿½

mrs. thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.

ï¿½he didnï¿½t stay with us,ï¿½ said mrs. harper, beginning to look uneasy. a
marked anxiety came into aunt pollyï¿½s face.

ï¿½joe harper, have you seen my tom this morning?ï¿½

ï¿½noï¿½m.ï¿½

ï¿½when did you see him last?ï¿½

joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. the people had
stopped moving out of church. whispers passed along, and a boding
uneasiness took possession of every countenance. children were anxiously
questioned, and young teachers. they all said they had not noticed
whether tom and becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;
it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing

huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. tom proudly
marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:

ï¿½here you are! look at it, huck; itï¿½s the snuggest hole in this country.
you just keep mum about it. all along iï¿½ve been wanting to be a robber,
but i knew iï¿½d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across
it was the bother. weï¿½ve got it now, and weï¿½ll keep it quiet, only weï¿½ll
let joe harper and ben rogers in--because of course thereï¿½s got to be a
gang, or else there wouldnï¿½t be any style about it. tom sawyerï¿½s gang--it
sounds splendid, donï¿½t it, huck?ï¿½

ï¿½well, it just does, tom. and whoï¿½ll we rob?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, most anybody. waylay people--thatï¿½s mostly the way.ï¿½

ï¿½and kill them?ï¿½

ï¿½no, not always. hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½s a ransom?ï¿½

ï¿½money. you make them raise all they can, offï¿½n their friends; and after
