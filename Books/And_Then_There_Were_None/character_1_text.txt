the contadini. later, he had heard, she had proceeded to syria where she 
proposed to bask in yet stronger sun and live at one with nature and the 
bedouin. 

constance culmington, he reflected to himself, was exactly the sort of woman 
who would buy an island and surround herself with mystery! nodding his head 
in gentle approval of his logic, mr. justice wargrave allowed his head to nod... he 
slept...

vera claythorne, in a third-class carriage with five other travellers in it, leaned 
her head back and shut her eyes. how hot it was travelling by train today! it 
would be nice to get to the sea! really a great piece of luck getting this job. when 
you wanted a holiday post it nearly always meant looking after a swarm of 
children - secretarial holiday posts were much more difficult to get. even the 
agency hadn't held out much hope. 

and then the letter had come.

and at the top was the stamped address indian island. sticklehaven. devon... 

indian island! why, there had been nothing else in the papers lately! all sorts of 
hints and interesting rumours. though probably that was mostly untrue. but the 
house had certainly been built by a millionaire and was said to be absolutely the 
last word in luxury. 

vera claythorne, tired by a recent strenuous term at school, thought to herself - 
"being a games mistress in a third-class school isn't much of a catch... if only i 
could get a job at some decent school." 

and then, with a cold feeling round her heart, she thought: "but i'm lucky to 
have even this. after all, people don't like a coroner's inquest, even if the 
coroner did acquit me of all blame!" 

he had even complimented her on her presence of mind and courage, she 
remembered. for an inquest it couldn't

mr. blore was in the slow train from plymouth. there was only one other person 
in his carriage, an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye. at the present 
moment he had dropped off to sleep. 

mr. blore was writing carefully in a little notebook. 



"that's the lot," he muttered to himself. "emily brent, vera claythorne, dr. 
armstrong, anthony marston, old justice wargrave, philip lombard, general 
macarthur, c.m.g., d.s.o. manservant and wife: mr. and mrs. rogers." 

he closed the notebook and put it back in his pocket. he glanced over at the 
corner and the slumbering man. 

"had one over the eight." diagnosed mr. blore accurately. he went over things 
carefully and conscientiously in his mind. 



"job ought to be easy enough," he ruminated. "don't see how i can slip up on it. 
hope i look all right."

and, maybe? he asked in a soft devon voice. four voices 
gave assent - and then immediately afterwards gave quick surreptitious glances 
at each other. 

the driver said, addressing his remarks to mr. justice wargrave as the senior 
member of the party: 

"there are two taxis here, sir. one of them must wait till the slow train from 
exeter gets in - a matter of five minutes - there's one gentleman coming by that. 
perhaps one of you wouldn't mind waiting? you'd be more comfortable that way." 

vera claythorne, her own secretarial position clear in her mind, spoke at once. 

"i'll wait," she said, "if you will go on?" she looked at the other three, her glance 
and voice had that slight suggestion of command in it that comes from having 
occupied a position of authority. she might have been directing which tennis sets 
the girls were to play in. 



miss brent said stiffly, "thank you," bent her head and entered one of the taxis, 
the door of which the driver was holding open.

fred narracott shut off the engine, they nosed their way gently into a little 
natural inlet between rocks. 

philip lombard said sharply: 

"must be difficult to land here in dirty weather." 

fred narracott said cheerfully: 



"can't land on indian island when there's a southeasterly. sometimes 'tis cut off 
for a week or more." 

vera claythorne thought: 

"the catering must be very difficult. that's the worst of an island. all the 
domestic problems are so worrying." 

the boat grated against the rocks. fred narracott jumped out and he and 
lombard helped the others to alight. narracott made the boat fast to a ring in 
the rock. then he led the way up steps cut in the rock. 

general macarthur said: 

"ha, delightful spot!" 

but he felt uneasy. damned odd sort of place.

dinner was drawing to a close. 

the food had been good, the wine perfect. rogers waited well. 

every one was in better spirits. they had begun to talk to each other with more 
freedom and intimacy. 

mr. justice wargrave, mellowed by the excellent port, was being amusing in a 
caustic fashion; dr. armstrong and tony marston were listening to him. miss 
brent chatted to general macarthur; they had discovered some mutual friends. 
vera claythorne was asking mr. davis intelligent questions about south africa. 
mr. davis was quite fluent on the subject. lombard listened to the conversation. 



once or twice he looked up quickly, and his eyes narrowed. now and then his 
eyes played round the table, studying the others. 

anthony marston said suddenly: 

"quaint, these things, aren't they?" 

in the centre of the round table, on a circular glass stand, were some little china 
figures. 

"indians." said tony. "indian island. i suppose that'

"i wonder. how many are there? ten?" 

"yes - ten there are." 

vera cried: 

"what fun! they're the ten little indian boys of the nursery rhyme, i suppose. in 
my bedroom the rhyme is framed and hung up over the mantelpiece." 

lombard said: 

"in my room, too." 

"and mine." 

"and mine." 



everybody joined the chorus. vera said: 

"it's an amusing idea, isn't it?" 

mr. justice wargrave grunted: 

"remarkably childish," and helped himself to port. 

emily brent looked at vera claythorne. vera claythorne looked at miss brent. 
the two women rose. 

in the drawing-room, the french windows were open onto the terrace and the 
sound of the sea murmuring against the rocks came up to them. 

emily brent said: "pleasant sound." 

vera said sharply: "i hate it." 

miss brent's eyes looked at her in surprise. vera flushed. she said, more 
composedly: 

"i don't think this place would be very agreeable in a storm." 

emily brent agreed. 

"i've no doubt the house is shut up in winter," s

though he had a private down on the fellow." 



all these memories rushed through the doctor's mind. before he could consider 
the wisdom of the question he had asked impulsively: 

"did you know seton at all? i mean previous to the case." 

the hooded reptilian eyes met his. in a clear cold voice the judge said: 

"i knew nothing of seton previous to the case." 

armstrong said to himself: 

"the fellow's lying - 1 know he's lying."

vera claythorne spoke in a trembling voice. 

she said: 

"i'd like to tell you. about that child - cyril hamilton. i was nursery governess to 
him. he was forbidden to swim out far. one day, when my attention was

worries. through the open window he could hear the waves breaking on the rocks

he thought: "peaceful sound. peaceful place..." 

he thought: "best of an island is once you get there - you can't go any further... 
you've come to the end of things..." 



he knew, suddenly, that he didn't want to leave the island.

vera claythorne lay in bed, wide awake, staring up at the ceiling. 

the light beside her was on. she was frightened of the dark. 

she was thinking: 

"hugo... hugo... why do i feel you're so near to me tonight?... somewhere quite 
close... 

"where is he really? i don't know. i never shall know. he just went away - right 
away - out of my life!" 

it was no good trying not to think of hugo. he was close to her. she had to think 
of him - to remember...

moved on to the chest of drawers. but there was no sign of sleeping draughts or 
tablets. 

rogers said: 

"she didn't have nothing last night, sir, except what you gave her..." 



ii 

when the gong sounded for breakfast at nine o'clock it found every one up and 
awaiting the summons. 

general macarthur and the judge had been pacing the terrace outside, 
exchanging desultory comments on the political situation. 

vera claythorne and philip lombard had been up to the summit of the island 
behind the house. there they had discovered william henry blore, standing 
staring at the mainland. 

he said: 

"no sign of that motor boat yet. i've been watching for it." 

vera said, smiling: 

"devon's a sleepy county. things are usually late." 

philip lombard was looking the other way, out to sea. 

he said abruptly: 

"what d'you think of the weather?" 

glancing up at the sky, blore remarked: 

"looks all right to me."

"but now, sir, when i came to clear away. see for yourself if you don't believe me. 

"there's only eight, sir! only eight! it doesn't make sense, does it? only eight..." 



chapter 7 



after breakfast, emily brent had suggested to vera claythorne that they should 
walk up to the summit again and watch for the boat. vera had acquiesced. 

the wind had freshened. small white crests were appearing on the sea. there 
were no fishing boats out - and no sign of the motor boat. 

the actual village of sticklehaven could not be seen, only the hill above it, a 
jutting-out cliff of red rock concealed the actual little bay.

carefully rewinding the end of it. 

as she took her seat at table she remarked: 

"the weather is changing. the wind is quite strong and there are white horses on 
the sea." 

mr. justice wargrave came in. he walked with a slow measured tread. he darted 
quick looks from under his bushy eyebrows at the other occupants of the dining- 
room. he said: 

"you have had an active morning." 

there was a faint malicious pleasure in his voice. 

vera claythorne hurried in. she was a little out of breath. 

she said quickly: 

"i hope you didn't wait for me. am i late?" 



emily brent said: 

"you're not the last. the general isn't here yet." 

they sat round the table. 

rogers addressed miss brent: 

"will you begin, madam, or will you wait?" 

vera said: 

"general macarthur is sitting right down by the sea. i don't expect he would hear 
the gong there and anyway" - she hesitated - "he's a little vague today, i think."

he said:

"dead!" the voice burst from vera explosively. 

armstrong said: 

"yes, he's dead..." 

there was a pause - a long pause. 

seven people looked at each other and could find no words to say. 



iv 

the storm broke just as the old man's body was borne in through the door. 

the others were standing in the hall. 

there was a sudden hiss and roar as the rain came down. 

as blore and armstrong passed up the stairs with their burden, vera claythorne 
turned suddenly and went into the deserted dining-room. 

it was as they had left it. the sweet course stood ready on the sideboard 
untasted, 

vera went up to the table. she was there a minute or two later when rogers 
came softly into the room. 

he started when he saw her. then his eyes asked a question. 



he said: 

"oh, miss, i - 1 just came to see..." 

in a loud harsh voice that surprised herself vera said: 

"you're quite right, rogers. look for yourself. there are only seven..."

general macarthur had been laid on his bed. 

after making a last examination armstrong left the room and came downstairs. 
he found the others assembled in the drawing-room. 

miss brent was knitting. vera claythorne was standing by the window looking 
out at the hissing rain, blore was sitting squarely in a chair, his hands on his 
knees. lombard was walking restlessly up and down. at the far end of the room 
mr. justice wargrave was sitting in a grandfather chair. his eyes were half 
closed. 

they opened as the doctor came into the room. he said in a clear penetrating 
voice: 

"well, doctor?" 

armstrong was very pale. he said:

things from the attic to another room. he had not looked out of the window 
during the morning and had seen nothing that could have any bearing upon the 
death of general macarthur. he would swear definitely that there had been eight 
china figures upon the dining-table when he laid the table for lunch. 

at the conclusion of rogers' evidence there was a pause. mr. justice wargrave 
cleared his throat. 

lombard murmured to vera claythorne: 

"the summing up will now take place!" 

the judge said: 

"we have inquired into the circumstances of these three deaths to the best of our 
ability. whilst probability in some cases is against certain people being 
implicated, yet we cannot say definitely that any one person can be considered as 
cleared of all complicity. i reiterate my positive belief that of the seven persons 
assembled in this room one is a dangerous and probably insane criminal. there is

philip lombard grinned suddenly. he said:

that i'm not the murderer, and i don't fancy that there's anything insane about 
you, vera. you strike me as being one of the sanest and most level-headed girls 
i've come across. i'd stake my reputation on your sanity." 

with a slightly wry smile, vera said: 

"thank you." 

he said: 

"come now, miss vera claythorne, aren't you going to return the compliment?" 

vera hesitated a minute, then she said:

but all the same i can't see you as - as the man who dictated that gramophone 
record." 

lombard said:

lombard said: 

"i mean that rogers is missing. he isn't in his room or anywhere else. and 
there's no kettle on and the kitchen fire isn't even lit." 

blore swore under his breath. he said: 

"where the devil can he be? out on the island somewhere? wait till i get some 
clothes on. see if the others know anything." 

philip lombard nodded. he moved along the line of closed doors. 

he found armstrong up and nearly dressed. mr. justice wargrave, like blore, 
had to be roused from sleep. vera claythorne was dressed. emily brent's room 
was empty. 

the little party moved through the house. rogers' room, as philip lombard had 
already ascertained, was untenanted. the bed had been slept in, and his razor 
and sponge and soap were wet. 

lombard said: 

"he got up all right." 

vera said in a low voice which she tried to make firm and assured: 

"you don't think he's - hiding somewhere - waiting for us?" 

lombard said:

"perfectly clear," said armstrong. "the murderer must have crept up behind him, 
swung the chopper once and brought it down on his head as he was bending 
over." 

blore was busy on the handle of the chopper and the flour sifter from the kitchen. 

mr. justice wargrave asked: 

"would it have needed great force, doctor?" 

armstrong said gravely: 

"a woman could have done it if that's what you mean." he gave a quick glance 
round. vera claythorne and emily brent had retired to the kitchen. "the girl 
could have done it easily - she's an athletic type. in appearance miss brent is 
fragile looking, but that type of woman has often a lot of wiry strength. and you 
must remember that any one who's mentally unhinged has a good deal of 
unsuspected strength." 

the judge nodded thoughtfully. 

blore rose from his knees with a sigh. he said: 

"no fingerprints. handle was wiped afterwards."

they stared at her uncomprehendingly. it was as though the sane well-balanced 
girl had gone mad before their eyes. she went on in that high unnatural voice:

emily brent was left alone sitting in the dining-room. 

for a while she heard a faint murmur of voices from the pantry. 

the giddiness was passing. she felt drowsy now, as though she could easily go to 
sleep. 

there was a buzzing in her ears - or was it a real buzzing in the room? 

she thought: 

"it's like a bee - a bumblebee." 

presently she saw the bee. it was crawling up the window-pane. 

vera claythorne had talked about bees this morning. 

bees and honey... 

she liked honey. honey in the comb, and strain it yourself through a muslin bag.

in the drawing-room they were waiting for emily brent. 

vera claythorne said: 



"shall i go and fetch her?" 

blore said quickly:

vera sat down again. every one looked inquiringly at blore. 

he said: 

"look here, everybody, my opinion's this: we needn't look farther for the author of 
these deaths than the dining-room at this minute. i'd take my oath that woman's 
the one we're after!"

"religious mania. what do you say, doctor?"

"i think it would be desirable if we went with you." 

philip said with a smile that was still nearer a snarl:

philip strode across to the bed-table and jerked open the drawer. 

then he recoiled with an oath. 

the drawer of the bed-table was empty.

"satisfied?" asked lombard. 

he had stripped to the skin and he and his room had been meticulously searched 
by the other three men. vera claythorne was outside in the corridor. 

the search proceeded methodically. in turn, armstrong, the judge and blore 
submitted to the same test. 

the four men emerged from blore's room and approached vera. it was the judge 
who spoke. 

"i hope you will understand. miss claythorne, that we can make no exceptions. 
that revolver must be found. you have, i presume, a bathing dress with you?" 

vera nodded. 

"then i will ask you to go into your room and put it on and then come out to us 
here."

coarser and clumsier in build. his walk was that of a slow padding animal. his 
eyes were bloodshot. there was a look of mingled ferocity and stupidity about 
him. he was like a beast at bay ready to charge its pursuers. philip lombard's 
senses seemed heightened, rather than diminished. his ears reacted to the 
slightest sound. his step was lighter and quicker, his body was lithe and 
graceful. and he smiled often, his lips curling back from his long white teeth. 

vera claythorne was very quiet. she sat most of the time huddled in a chair. her 
eyes stared ahead of her into space. she looked dazed. she was like a bird that 
has dashed its head against glass and that has been picked up by a human hand. 
it crouches there, terrified, unable to move, hoping to save itself by its 
immobility.

found it well above the reach of any tide. and it was laid out straight on the 
ground - all neat and tidy. 

"so that settles one point definitely. some one was alive on the island after 
armstrong was dead." 

he paused and then went on. 

"and that leaves - just what exactly? here's the position early on the morning of 
the 11th. armstrong has 'disappeared' (drowned). that leaves us three people. 
lombard, blore and vera claythorne. lombard was shot. his body was down by 
the sea - near armstrong's. vera claythorne was found hanged in her own 
bedroom. blore's body was on the terrace. his head was crushed in by a heavy 
marble clock that it seems reasonable to suppose fell on him from the window 
above." 

the a.c. said sharply: 

"whose window?" 

"vera claythorne's. now, sir, let's take each of these cases separately. first 
philip lombard. let's say he pushed over that lump of marble onto blore - then 



he doped vera

 claythorne and strung her up. lastly, he went down to the 
seashore and shot himself. 

"but if so, woo took away the revolver from him? for that revolver was found up 
in the house just inside the door at the top of the stairs - wargrave's room." 

the a.c. said: 

"any fingerprints on it?" 

"yes, sir, vera claythorne's." 

"but, man alive, then -" 

"i know what you're going to say, sir. that it was vera claythorne. that she shot 
lombard, took the revolver back to the house, toppled the marble block onto 
blore and then - hanged herself. 

"and that's quite all right - up to a point. there's a chair in her bedroom and on 
the seat of it there are marks of seaweed same as on her shoes. looks as though 
she stood on the chair, adjusted the rope round her neck and kicked away the 
chair. 

"but that chair wasn't found kicked over. it was, like, all the other chairs, neatly 
put back against the wall. that w

as done after vera claythorne's death - by some 
one else. 

"that leaves us with blore and if you tell me that after shooting lombard and 
inducing vera claythorne to hang herself he then went out and pulled down a 
whacking great block of marble on himself by tying a string to it or something 
like that - well, i simply don't believe you. men don't commit suicide that way - 



and what's more blore wasn't that kind of man. we knew blore - and he was not 
the man that you'd ever accuse of a desire for abstract justice." 

the assistant commissioner said: 

i agree. 

inspector maine said:

 and his inability to 
feel any responsibility for the lives he had taken made him, i considered, a type 
dangerous to the community and unfit to live. ex-inspector blore came my way 
quite naturally, some of my professional brethren discussing the landor case 
with freedom and vigour. i took a serious view of his offence. the police, as 
servants of the law, must be of a high order of integrity. for their word is 
perforce believed by virtue of their profession. 

finally there was the case of vera claythorne. it was when i was crossing the 
atlantic. at a late hour one night the sole occupants of the smoking-room were 
myself and a good-looking young man called hugo hamilton. 

hugo hamilton was unhappy. to assuage that unhappiness he had taken a 
considerable quantity of drink. he was in the maudlin confidential stage. 
without much hope of any result i automatically started my routine 
conversational gambit. the response was startling. i can remember his words 
now. he said: 



"you're right. mu

ered. 

the red curtain i had concealed by laying it flat on the seat of one of the drawing- 
room chairs under the chintz cover and the wool in the seat cushion, cutting a 
small hole. 

and now came the moment that i had anticipated - three people who were so 
frightened of each other that anything might happen - and one of them had a 
revolver. i watched them from the windows of the house. when blore came up 
alone i had the big marble clock poised ready. exit blore... 

from my window i saw vera claythorne shoot lombard. a daring and 
resourceful young woman. i always thought she was a match for him and more. 
as soon as that had happened i set the stage in her bedroom. 

it was an interesting psychological experiment. would the consciousness of her 
own guilt, the state of nervous tension consequent on having just shot a man, be 
sufficient, together with the hypnotic suggestion of the surroundings, to cause 



her to take her own life? i thought it would. i was right. vera claythorne hanged
