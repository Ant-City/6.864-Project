t think it had anything to do with the war. they were sure billy was going to
pieces because his father had thrown him into the deep end of the y.m.c.a. swimming
pool when he was a little boy, and had then taken him to the rim of the grand canyon.
 the man assigned to the bed next to billy's was a former infantry captain named eliot
rosewater. rosewater was sick and tired of being drunk all the time.
 it was rosewater who introduced billy to science fiction, and in particular to the
writings of kilgore trout. rosewater had a tremendous collection of science-fiction
paperbacks under his bed. he had brought them to the hospital in a steamer trunk. those
beloved, frumpish books gave off a smell that permeated the ward-like flannel pajamas
that hadn't been changed for a month, or like irish stew.
 kilgore trout became billy's favorite living author, and science fiction became the
only sort of tales he could read.
 rosewater was twice as smart as billy, but he and billy were dealing with similar
crises

 and on and on it went--that duet between the dumb, praying lady and the big, hollow
man so full of loving echoes.
 'he was at the top of his class when this happened,' said billy's mother.
 'maybe he was working too hard.' said rosewater. he held a book he wanted to read,
but he was much too polite to read and talk, too, easy as it was to give billy's mother
satisfactory answers. the book was maniacs in the fourth dimension, by kilgore trout.
it was about people whose mental diseases couldn't be treated because the causes of the
diseases were all in the fourth dimension, and three-dimensional earthling doctors
couldn't see those causes at all, or even imagine them.
 one thing trout said that rosewater liked very much was that there really were
vampires and werewolves and goblins and angels and so on, but that they were in the
fourth dimension. so was william blake, rosewater's favorite poet, according to trout.
so were heaven and h

 she asked him if there was anything she could bring him from the outside, and he said,
'no. i have just about everything i want.'
 'what about books?' said valencia.
 'i'm right next to one of the biggest private libraries in the world,' said billy, meaning
eliot rosewater's collection of science fiction.
 rosewater was on the next bed, reading, and billy drew him into the conversation,
asked him what he was reading this time.
 so rosewater told him. it was the gospel from outer space, by kilgore trout. it was
about a visitor from outer space, shaped very much like a tralfamadorian by the way.
the visitor from outer space made a serious study of christianity, to learn, if he could,
why christians found it so easy to be cruel. he concluded that at least part of the trouble
was slipshod storytelling in the new testament. he supposed that the intent of the
gospels was to teach people, among other things, to be merciful, even to the lowest of the
low.
 but the gospels actually taught this:

milky way.
 'forget books,' said rosewater, throwing that particular book under his bed. 'the hell

 'that sounded like an interesting one,' said valencia.
 jesus-if kilgore trout could only write!' rosewater exclaimed. he had a point: kilgore
trout's unpopularity was deserved. his prose was frightful. only his ideas were good.
 'i don't think trout has ever been out of the country, ' rosewater went on. 'my god-he
writes about earthlings all the time, and they're all americans. practically nobody on
earth is an american.'
 'where does he live?" valencia asked.
 'nobody knows,' rosewater replied. 'i'm the only person who ever heard of him, as far

 he changed the subject now, congratulated valencia on her engagement ring.
 'thank you,' she said, and held it out so rosewater could get a close look. 'billy got
that diamond in the war.'
 'that's the attractive thing about war,' said rosewater. absolutely everybody gets a
little something.'
 with regard to the whereabouts of kilgore trout: he actually lived in ilium, billy's
hometown, friendless and despised. billy would meet him by and by.
 'billy' said valencia merble.
 'hm?'
 'you want to talk about our silver pattern? '
 'sure.'
 'i've got it narrowed down pretty much to either royal danish or rambler rose.'
 'rambler rose,' said billy.
 'it isn't something we should rush into,' she said. 'i mean whatever we decide on, that's
what we're going to have to live with the rest of our lives.'
 billy studied the pictures. 'royal da

 nothing happened that night. it was the next night that about one hundred and thirty
thousand people in dresden would die. so it goes. billy dozed in the meat locker. he
found himself engaged again, word for word, gesture for gesture, in the argument with
his daughter with which this tale begun.
 'father,' she said, 'what are we going to do with you?'
 and so on. 'you know who i could just kill?' she asked.
 'who could you kill?' said billy.
 'that kilgore trout.'
 kilgore trout was and is a science-fiction writer, of course. billy has not only read
dozens of books by trout-he has also become a friend of trout, who is a bitter man.
 trout lives in a rented basement in ilium, about two miles from billy's nice white
home. he himself has no idea how many novels he has written-possibly seventy-five of
the things. not one of them has made money. so trout keeps body and soul together as a
circulation man for the ilium gazette, manages newspaper delivery boys

 a newspaper girl. she was electrified.
 trout's paranoid face was terribly familiar to billy, who had seen it on the jackets of so
many books. but, coming upon that face suddenly in a home-town alley, billy could not
guess why the face was familiar. billy thought maybe he had known this cracked messiah
in dresden somewhere. trout certainly looked like a prisoner of war.
 and then the newspaper girl held up her hand. 'mr. trout,' she said, 'if i win, can i take
my sister, too?'
 'hell no,' said kilgore trout. 'you think money grows on trees?'
 trout, incidentally, had written a book about a money tree. it had twenty-dollar bills
for leaves. its flowers were government bonds. its fruit was diamonds. it attracted human
beings who killed each other around the roots and made very good fertilizer.
 so it goes.
 billy pilgrim parked his cadillac in the alley, and waited for the meeting to end. when
the meeting broke up, there was still one boy trout had to deal with. the boy wanted to
quit because the wo

 who had carried newspapers as boys, and the boy replied: 'yeah-but i bet
they quit after a week, it's such a royal screwing.'
 and the boy left his full newspaper bag at trout's feet, with the customer book on top.
it was up to trout to deliver these papers. he didn't have a car. he didn't even have a
bicycle, and he was scared to death of dogs.
 somewhere a big dog barked.
 as trout lugubriously slung the bag from his shoulder, billy pilgrim approached him.
 'mr. trout-'
 'yes?'
 "are-are you kilgore trout?
 'yes.' trout supposed that billy had some complaint about the way his newspapers
were being delivered. he did not think of himself as a writer for the simple reason that
the world had never allowed him to think of himself in this way.
 'the-the writer?' said billy.
 'the what?'
 billy was certain that he had made a mistake. 'there's a writer named kilgore trout.'
 'there is?' trout looked foolish and dazed.
 'you never heard of him?'
 trout shook his head. 'nobody-nobody ever did.'

elt like writing you letters many

 trout held up a single finger. 'one.'
 'was it enthusiastic?'
 'it was insane. the writer said i should be president of the world.'
 it turned out that the person who had written this letter was elliot rosewater, billy's
friend in the veterans' hospital near lake placid. billy told trout about rosewater.
 'my god-i thought he was about fourteen years old,' said trout.
 "a full grown man-a captain in the war.'
 'he writes like a fourteen-year-old,' said kilgore trout.
 billy invited trout to his eighteenth wedding anniversary which was only two days
hence. now the party was in progress.
 trout was in billy's dining room, gobbling canapés. he was talking with a mouthful of
philadelphia cream cheese and salmon roe to an optometrist's wife. everybody at the
party was associated with optometry in some way, except trout. and he alone was
without glasses. he was making a great hit. everybody was glad to have a real author at
the party, even though they had never

 'i put everything that happens to me in books.'
 'i guess i better be careful what i say.'
 'that's right. and i'm not the only one who's listening. god is listening, too. and on
judgment day he's going to tell you all the things you said and did. if it turns out they're
bad things instead of good things, that's too bad for you, because you'll burn forever and
ever. the burning never stops hurting.'
 poor maggie turned gray. she believed that too, and was petrified.
 kilgore trout laughed uproariously. a salmon egg flew out of his mouth and landed in
maggie's cleavage.
 now an optometrist called for attention. he proposed a toast to billy and valencia,
whose anniversary it was. according to plan, the barbershop quartet of optometrists, 'the
febs,' sang while people drank and billy and valencia put their arms around each other,
just glowed. everybody's eyes were shining. the song was 'that old gang of mine.'
 gee, that song went, but i'd give the world to see that old gan

 said valencia, leaning over him, 'billy-are you all right?'
 'yes.'
 'you look so awful.'
 'really-i'm o.k.' and he was, too, except that he could find no explanation for why the
song had affected him so grotesquely. he had supposed for years that he had no secrets
from himself. here was proof that he had a great big secret somewhere inside, and he
could not imagine what it was.
 people drifted away now, seeing the color return to billy's cheeks, seeing him smile.
valencia stayed with him, and kilgore trout, who had been on the fringe of the crowd,
came closer, interested, shrewd.
 'you looked as though you'd seen a ghost,' said valencia.
 'no,' said billy. he hadn't seen anything but what was really before him-the faces of
the four singers, those four ordinary men, cow-eyed and mindless and anguished as they
went from sweetness to sourness to sweetness again.
 'can i make a guess?' said kilgore trout 'you saw through a time window.'
 'a what?' said valencia.
 'he suddenly saw the past or the futu

re. am i right?'
 'no,' said billy pilgrim. he got up, put a hand into his pocket, found the box containing
the ring in there. he took out the box, gave it absently to valencia. he had meant to give
it to her at the end of the song, while everybody was watching. only kilgore trout was
there to see.
 'for me?' said valencia.
 'yes'
 'oh my god', she said. then she said it louder, so other people heard. they gathered
around, and she opened it, and she almost screamed when she saw the sapphire with a
star in it. 'oh my god,' she said. she gave billy a big kiss. she said, 'thank you, thank
you, thank you.'
 there was a lot of talk about what wonderful jewelry billy had given to valencia over
the years. 'my god,' said maggie white, 'she's already got the biggest diamond i eve

s dresser drawer. billy had a wonderful collection of cufflinks. it
was the custom of the family to give him cufflinks on every father's day. he was
wearing father's day cufflinks now. they had cost over one hundred dollars. they were
made out of ancient roman coins. he had one pair of cufflinks upstairs which were little
roulette wheels that really worked. he had another pair which had a real thermometer in
one and a real compass in the other.
 billy now moved about the party-outwardly normal. kilgore trout was shadowing
him, keen to know what billy had suspected or seen. most of trout's novels, after all,
dealt with time warps and extrasensory perception and other unexpected things. trout
believed in things like that, was greedy to have their existence proved.
 'you ever put a full-length mirror on the floor, and then have a dog stand on it?' trout
asked billy.
 'no.'
 'the dog will look down, and all of a sudden he'll realize there's nothing under him. he
thinks he's standing on thin air. he'll

only a little after eight o'clock, so all the shows were about silliness or murder. so it goes.
 billy left his room, went down the slow elevator, walked over to times square, looked
into the window of a tawdry bookstore. in the window were hundreds of books about
fucking and buggery and murder, and a street guide to new york city, and a model of
the statue of liberty with a thermometer on it. also in the window, speckled with soot
and fly shit, were four paperback novels by billy's friend, kilgore trout.
 the news of the day, meanwhile, was being written in a ribbon of lights on a building
to billy's back. the window reflected the news. it was about power and sports and anger
and death. so it goes.
 billy went into the bookstore.
 a sign in there said that adults only were allowed in the back. there were peep shows
in the back that showed movies of young women and men with no clothes on. it cost a
quarter to look into a machine for one minute. there were still photographs of naked
young people

 could look at them whenever you
wanted to, and they wouldn't change. twenty years in the future, those girls would still
be young, would still be smiling or smoldering or simply looking stupid, with their legs
wide open. some of them were eating lollipops or bananas. they would still be eating
those. and the peckers of the young men would still be semi-erect, and their muscles
would be bulging like cannonballs.
 but billy pilgrim wasn't beguiled by the back of the store. he was thrilled by the
kilgore trout novels in the front. the tides were all new to him, or he thought they were.
now he opened one. it seemed all right for him to do that. everybody else in the store
was pawing things. the name of the book was the big board. he got a few paragraphs
into it, and then realized that he had read it before-years ago, in the veterans' hospital. it
was about an earthling man and woman who were kidnapped by extra-terrestrials. they
were put on display in a zoo on a planet called zircon-212.

 the earthlings did very well on paper. that was part of the rigging, of course. and
religion got mixed up in it, too. the news ticker reminded them that the president of the
united states had declared national prayer week, and that everybody should pray. the
earthlings had had a bad week on the market before that. they had lost a small fortune in
olive oil futures. so they gave praying a whirl.
 it worked. olive oil went up.
 another kilgore trout book there in the window was about a man who built a time
machine so he could go back and see jesus. it worked, and he saw jesus when jesus was
only twelve years old. jesus was learning the carpentry trade from his father.
 two roman soldiers came into the shop with a mechanical drawing on papyrus of a
device they wanted built by sunrise the next morning. it was a cross to be used in the
execution of a rabble-rouser.

 'time-traveling again?' said montana. it was artificial evening in the dome. she was
breast-feeding their child.
 'hmm?' said billy.
 'you've been time-traveling again. i can always tell.'
 'um.'
 'where did you go this time? it wasn't the war. i can tell that, too. '
 'new york.'
 'the big apple.'
 'hm?'
 'that's what they used to call new york.'
 "oh.'
 'you see any plays or movies?'
 'no-i walked around times square some, bought a book by kilgore trout.'
 'lucky you.' she did not share his enthusiasm for kilgore trout.
 billy mentioned casually that he had seen part of a blue movie she had made. her
response was no less casual. it was tralfamadorian and guilt-free:
 'yes-' she said, 'and i've heard about you in the war, about what a clown you were. and
i've heard about the high school teacher who was shot. he made a blue movie with a
firing squad.' she moved the baby from one breast to the other, because the moment was

in vietnam. so it goes.
 my father died many years ago now-of natural causes. so it goes. he was a sweet man.
he was a gun nut, too. he left me his guns. they rust.
 on tralfamadore, says billy pilgrim, there isn't much interest in jesus christ. the
earthling figure who is most engaging to the tralfamadorian mind, he says, is charles
darwin-who taught that those who die are meant to die, that corpses are improvements.
so it goes.
 the same general idea appears in the big board by kilgore trout. the flying saucer
creatures who capture trout's hero ask him about darwin. they also ask him about golf.
 if what billy pilgrim learned from the tralfamadorians is true, that we will all live
forever, no matter how dead we may sometimes seem to be, i am not overjoyed. still-if i
am going to spend eternity visiting this moment and that, i'm grateful that so many of
those moments are nice.
 one of the nicest ones in recent times was on my trip back to dresden with my old war
