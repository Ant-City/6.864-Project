'little man, would you come on! you keep it up and you're gonna make us late.'
my youngest brother paid no attention to me. grasping more firmly his newspaper-wrapped notebook and his tin can lunch of
cornbread and oil sausages, he continued to concentrate on the dusty road. he lagged several feet behind my other brothers,
stacey and christopher-john, and me, attempting to keep the rusty mississippi dust from swelling with each step and drifting
back upon his shiny black shoes and the cuffs of his corduroy pants by lifting each foot high before setting it gently down
again. always meticulously neat, six-year old little man never allowed dirt or tears or stains to mar anything he owned.
today was no exception.
'you keep it up and make us late for school, mama's gonna wear you out.' i threatened, pulling with exasperation at the high
collar o

f the sunday dress mama had made me wear for the first day of school - as if that event were something special. it
seemed to me that showing up at school at all on a bright august-like october morning made for running the cool forest trails
and wading barefoot in the forest pond was concession enough; sunday clothing was asking too much. christopher-john and
stacey were not too pleased about the clothing or school either. only little man, just beginning his school career, found the
prospects of both intriguing.
'y'all go ahead and get dirty if y'all wanna,' he replied without even looking up from his studied steps, 'me, i'm gonna stay
clean.'
‘i betcha mama's gonna "clean" you, you keep it up.' i grumbled.
‘ah, cassie, leave him be,' stacey admonished, frowning and kicking testily at the road. 
‘i ain't said nothing but..’
stacey cut me

 a wicked look and i grew silent. his disposition had been irritatingly sour lately. if i hadn't known the cause of
it. i could have forgotten very easily that he was at twelve, bigger than i, and that i had promised mama to arrive at school
looking clean and ladylike. 'shoot,' i mumbled finally, unable to restrain myself from further comment, 'it ain't my fault you
gotta be in mama's class this year.'
stacey's frown deepened and he jammed his fists into his pockets, but said nothing.
christopher-john, walking between stacey and me, glanced uneasily at both of us but did not interfere. a short, round boy of
seven, he took little interest in troublesome things, preferring to remain on good terms with everyone, yet he was always
sensitive to others and now, shifting the handle of his lunch can from his right hand to his right wrist and his smudged
notebook from his left hand to his left armpit. he stuffed his free hands into his pockets and attempted to make his face as
moody as stacey's and a

s cranky as mine. but after a few moments he seemed to forget that he was supposed to be grouchy
and began whistling cheerfully. there was little that could make christopher-john unhappy for very long, not even the
thought of school.
i tugged again at my collar and dragged my feet in the dust, allowing it to sift back onto my socks and shoes like gritty red
snow. i hated the dress. and the shoes. there was little i could do in a dress, and as for shoes, they imprisoned freedomloving
feet accustomed to the feel of the warm earth,
‘cassie, stop that,' stacey snapped as the dust billowed in swirling clouds around my feet. i looked up sharply, ready to
protest. christophe

once why he had to go away, why the land was so important. he took my hand and said in his quiet way: 'look
out there, cassie girl. all that belongs to you. you ain't never had to live on nobody's place but your own and long as i live
and the family survives, you'll never have to. that's important. you may not understand that now, but one day you will. then
you'll see.
i looked at papa strangely when he said that, for i knew that all the land did not belong to me. some of it belonged to stacey,
christopher-john, and little man, not to mention the part that belonged to big ma. mama, and uncle hammer, papa's older
brother who lived in chicago. but papa never divided the land in his mind: it was simply logan land. for it he would work
the long, hot summer pounding steel: mama would teach and run the farm; big ma, in her sixties, would work like a woman
of twenty in the fields and keep the house; and the boys and i would wear threadbare clothing washed to dishwater color: but
always, the taxes and the mor

 like t.j. very much and his stalling around didn't help.
'come on, t.j.,' said stacey, 'out with it.'
'well ...' t.j. murmured, then grew silent as if considering whether or not he should talk,
we reached the first of two crossroads and turned north; another mile and we would approach the second crossroads and turn
east again.
finally t.j. said, 'okay. see, them berrys' burnin' wasn't no accident. some white men took a match to 'em,'
'y-you mean just lit 'em up like a piece of wood!' stammered christopher-john, his eyes growing big with disbelief. 'but
why!' asked stacey,
t.j. shrugged. 'don't know why. jus' know they done it, that's all.'
'how you know !' i questioned suspiciously.
he smiled smugly. ''cause your mama come down on her way to school and talked to my mama 'bout it.'
'she did !'
'yeah, and you should've seen the way she look when she come outa that house.'
'how'd she look!' inquired little man, interested enough to glance up from the road for the first time.
t.j. looked around grimly an

give out sometimes and i had to go and get him 'cause i knowed good and well she didn't want us up there. boy, did he get
it?' t.j. laughed. 'mama 'bout wore him out.
i stared at quiet claude. 'you let him do that!' i exclaimed. but claude only smiled in that sickly way of his and i knew that
he had. he was more afraid of t.j. than of his mother.
again little man glanced up and i could see his dislike for t.j. growing. friendly christopher-john glared at t.j., and
putting his short arm around claude's shoulder said. 'come on, claude. let's go on ahead.' then he and claude hurried up the
road, away from t.j.
stacey, who generally overlooked t.j.'s underhanded stunts, shook his head. 'that was dirty. 'well, what'd ya expect me to
do! i couldn't let her think i was g-oin' up there 'cause i like to, could i! she' d've killed me!'
'and good riddance.' i thought, promising myself that if he ever pulled anything like that on me, i'd knock hi

-room church
at the opposite edge of the compound. it was to this church that many of the school's students and their parents belonged. as
we arrived, the enormous iron bell in the church belfry was ringing vigorously, warning the milling students that only five
minutes of freedom remained.
little man immediately pushed his way across the lawn to the well. stacey and t.j., ignoring the rest of us now that they
were on the school grounds, wandered off to be with the other seventh-grade boys, and christopher-john and claude rushed
to reunite with their classmates of last year. left alone, i dragged slowly to the building that held the first four grades and sat
on the bottom step. plopping my pencils and notebook into the dirt, i propped my elbows on my knees and rested my chin in
the palms of my hands.
'hey, cassie,' said mary lou wellever, the principal's daughter, as she flounced by in a new yellow dress.
'hey, yourself,' i said, scowling so ferociously that she kept on walking. i stared after her a m
