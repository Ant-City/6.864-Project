d i set my face resolutely for this man of
the island and walked briskly towards him.

he was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must
have been watching me closely, for as soon as i began to move in his
direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me. then he hesitated,
drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and
confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in
supplication.

at that i once more stopped.

"who are you?" i asked.

"ben gunn," he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward,
like a rusty lock. "i'm poor ben gunn, i am; and i haven't spoke with a
christian these three years."

i could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his
features were even pleasing. his skin, wherever it was exposed, was
burnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked
quite startling in so dark a face. of all the beggar-men that i had seen
or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. he was clothed with

"if you was sent by long john," he said, "i'm as good as pork, and i
know it. but where was you, do you suppose?"

i had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him
the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found
ourselves. he heard me with the keenest interest, and when i had done he
patted me on the head.

"you're a good lad, jim," he said; "and you're all in a clove hitch,
ain't you? well, you just put your trust in ben gunn--ben gunn's the man
to do it. would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove
a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you
remark?"

i told him the squire was the most liberal of men.

"aye, but you see," returned ben gunn, "i didn't mean giving me a gate
to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not my mark,
jim. what i mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say
one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's o

"left, left," says he; "keep to your left hand, mate jim! under the
trees with you! theer's where i killed my first goat. they don't come
down here now; they're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear
of benjamin gunn. ah! and there's the cetemery"--cemetery, he must have
meant. "you see the mounds? i come here and prayed, nows and thens, when
i thought maybe a sunday would be about doo. it weren't quite a chapel,
but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, ben gunn was
short-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a bible and a flag, you says."

so he kept talking as i ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer.

the cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley
of small arms.

another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, i
beheld the union jack flutter in the air above a wood.

a hail on the land side.

"somebody hailing us," said hunter, who was on guard.

"doctor! squire! captain! hullo, hunter, is that you?" came the cries.

and i ran to the door in time to see jim hawkins, safe and sound, come
climbing over the stockade.

narrative resumed by jim hawkins: the garrison in the stockade

as soon as ben gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the
arm, and sat down.

"now," said he, "there's your friends, sure enough."

"far more likely it's the mutineers," i answered.

"that!" he cried. "why, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but
gen'lemen of fortune, silver would fly the jolly roger, you don't make
no doubt of that. no, that's your friends. there's been blows too, and i
reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in
the old stockade, as was made year

s and years ago by flint. ah, he was
the man to have a headpiece, was flint! barring rum, his match were
never seen. he were afraid of none, not he; on'y silver--silver was that
genteel."

"well," said i, "that may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that
i should hurry on and join my friends."

"nay, mate," returned ben, "not you. you're a good boy, or i'm mistook;
but you're on'y a boy, all told. now, ben gunn is fly. rum wouldn't
bring me there, where you're going--not rum wouldn't, till i see your
born gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour. and you won't forget
my words; 'a precious sight (that's what you'll say), a precious sight
more confidence'--and then nips him."

and he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness.

"and when ben gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, jim. just
wheer you found him today. and him that comes is to have a white thing
in his hand, and he's

ish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found
where i found you. is that all?"

"and when? says you," he added. "why, from about noon observation to
about six bells."

"good," said i, "and now may i go?"

"you won't forget?" he inquired anxiously. "precious sight, and reasons
of his own, says you. reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as
between man and man. well, then"--still holding me--"i reckon you can
go, jim. and, jim, if you was to see silver, you wouldn't go for to sell
ben gunn? wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? no, says you. and if
them pirates camp ashore, jim, what would you say but there'd be widders
in the morning?"

here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing
through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where
we two were talking. the next moment each of us had taken to his heels
in a different direction.

for a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and
balls kept crashing through the woods. i

aptain himself went from one to another, keeping up
our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.

from time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to
rest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and whenever he
did so, he had a word for me.

"that man smollett," he said once, "is a better man than i am. and when
i say that it means a deal, jim."

another time he came and was silent for a while. then he put his head on
one side, and looked at me.

"is this ben gunn a man?" he asked.

"i do not know, sir," said i. "i am not very sure whether he's sane."

"if there's any doubt about the matter, he is," returned the doctor. "a
man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island, jim,
can't expect to appear as sane as you or me. it doesn't lie in human
nature. was it cheese you said he had a fancy for?"

"yes, sir, cheese," i answered.

"well, jim," says he, "just see the good that comes of being dainty in
your food. you've seen my snuff-box, hav

en't you? and you never saw me
take snuff, the reason being that in my snuff-box i carry a piece of
parmesan cheese--a cheese made in italy, very nutritious. well, that's
for ben gunn!"

before supper was eaten we buried old tom in the sand and stood round
him for a while bare-headed in the breeze. a good deal of firewood had
been got in, but not enough for the captain's fancy, and he shook his
head over it and told us we "must get back to this tomorrow rather
livelier." then, when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff
glass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got together in a corner to
discuss our prospects.

it appears they were at their wits' end what to do, the s

be out of earshot of our officers consulting; and gray took his pipe out
of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck
he was at this occurrence.

"why, in the name of davy jones," said he, "is dr. livesey mad?"

"why no," says i. "he's about the last of this crew for that, i take
it."

"well, shipmate," said gray, "mad he may not be; but if he's not, you
mark my words, i am."

"i take it," replied i, "the doctor has his idea; and if i am right,
he's going now to see ben gunn."

i was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being
stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze
with midday sun, i began to get another thought into my head, which was
not by any means so right. what i began to do was to envy the doctor
walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the
pleasant smell of the pines, while i sat grilling, with my clothes
stuck to the hot resin, and so much blood about me and so many poor
dead bodi

scuits, should anything befall me, would keep me, at
least, from starving till far on in the next day.

the next thing i laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as i already
had a powder-horn and bullets, i felt myself well supplied with arms.

as for the scheme i had in my head, it was not a bad one in itself. i
was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east
from the open sea, find the white rock i had observed last evening, and
ascertain whether it was there or not that ben gunn had hidden his boat,
a thing quite worth doing, as i still believe. but as i was certain i
should not be allowed to leave the enclosure, my only plan was to take
french leave and slip out when nobody was watching, and that was so bad
a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong. but i was only a boy,
and i had made my mind up.

well, as things at last fell out, i found an admirable opportunity. the
squire and gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages, the
coast was clear, i made

 goodish while to get up
with it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub. night had almost
come when i laid my hand on its rough sides. right below it there was
an exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick
underwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the
centre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what
the gipsies carry about with them in england.

i dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was
ben gunn's boat--home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude,
lop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of
goat-skin, with the hair inside. the thing was extremely small, even
for me, and i can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a
full-sized man. there was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of
stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion.

i had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient britons made, but
i have seen one since, and i can

 give you no fairer idea of ben gunn's
boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever
made by man. but the great advantage of the coracle it certainly
possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable.

well, now that i had found the boat, you would have thought i had had
enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime i had taken another
notion and become so obstinately fond of it that i would have carried
it out, i believe, in the teeth of captain smollett himself. this was
to slip out under cover of th

the ebb-tide runs

the coracle--as i had ample reason to know before i was done with
her--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both
buoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained,
lop-sided craft to manage. do as you pleased, she always made more
leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre
she was best at. even ben gunn himself has admitted that she was "queer
to handle till you knew her way."

certainly i did not know her way. she turned in every direction but the
one i was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on,
and i am very sure i never should have made the ship at all but for the
tide. by good fortune, paddle as i pleased, the tide was still sweeping
me down; and there lay the hispaniola right in the fairway, hardly to be
missed.

first she loomed before me like a blot of something ye

et my face homeward for
the block house and my companions. i remembered that the most easterly
of the rivers which drain into captain kidd's anchorage ran from the
two-peaked hill upon my left, and i bent my course in that direction
that i might pass the stream while it was small. the wood was pretty
open, and keeping along the lower spurs, i had soon turned the corner
of that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the
watercourse.

this brought me near to where i had encountered ben gunn, the maroon;
and i walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side. the dusk
had come nigh hand completely, and as i opened out the cleft between the
two peaks, i became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, as
i judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring
fire. and yet i wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so
careless. for if i could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyes
of silver himself where he camped upon the shore among

part by risking,
and she lies in north inlet, on the southern beach, and just below high
water. at half tide she must be high and dry."

"the ship!" exclaimed the doctor.

rapidly i described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in
silence.

"there is a kind of fate in this," he observed when i had done. "every
step, it's you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance
that we are going to let you lose yours? that would be a poor return, my
boy. you found out the plot; you found ben gunn--the best deed that
ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. oh, by jupiter, and
talking of ben gunn! why, this is the mischief in person. silver!" he
cried. "silver! i'll give you a piece of advice," he continued as
the cook drew near again; "don't you be in any great hurry after that
treasure."

"why, sir, i do my possible, which that ain't," said silver. "i can
only, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy's by seeking for that
treasure; and you may lay to that."

"well, sil

rely?"

this argument seemed weak enough to me. but you can never tell what will
affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, george merry was greatly
relieved.

"well, that's so," he said. "you've a head upon your shoulders, john,
and no mistake. 'bout ship, mates! this here crew is on a wrong tack, i
do believe. and come to think on it, it was like flint's voice, i
grant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all. it was liker
somebody else's voice now--it was liker--"

"by the powers, ben gunn!" roared silver.

"aye, and so it were," cried morgan, springing on his knees. "ben gunn
it were!"

"it don't make much odds, do it, now?" asked dick. "ben gunn's not here
in the body any more'n flint."

but the older hands greeted this remark with scorn.

"why, nobody minds ben gunn," cried merry; "dead or alive, nobody minds
him."

it was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural
colour had revived in their faces. soon they were chatting together,
with intervals of list

ening; and not long after, hearing no further
sound, they shouldered the tools and set forth again, merry walking
first with silver's compass to keep them on the right line with skeleton
island. he had said the truth: dead or alive, nobody minded ben gunn.

dick alone still held his bible, and looked around him as he went, with
fearful glances; but he found no sympathy, and silver even joked him on
his precautions.

"i told you," said he--"i told you you had sp'iled your bible. if it
ain't no good to swear by, what do you suppose a sperrit would give for
it? not that!" and he snapped his big fingers, halting a moment on his
crutch.

but dick was not to be comforted; indeed, it was soon plain to me that
the lad was falling sick; hastened by heat,

the thicket. merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation; the
man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length
upon his side, where he lay dead, but still twitching; and the other
three turned and ran for it with all their might.

before you could wink, long john had fired two barrels of a pistol into
the struggling merry, and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the
last agony, "george," said he, "i reckon i settled you."

at the same moment, the doctor, gray, and ben gunn joined us, with
smoking muskets, from among the nutmeg-trees.

"forward!" cried the doctor. "double quick, my lads. we must head 'em
off the boats."

and we set off at a great pace, sometimes plunging through the bushes to
the chest.

i tell you, but silver was anxious to keep up with us. the work that man
went through, leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were
fit to burst, was work no sound man ever equalled; and so thinks the
doctor. as it was, he was already thirty yards behi
 
 ___________________________
 
 of the slope.

"doctor," he hailed, "see there! no hurry!"

sure enough there was no hurry. in a more open part of the plateau, we
could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as
they had started, right for mizzenmast hill. we were already between
them and the boats; and so we four sat down to breathe, while long john,
mopping his face, came slowly up with us.

"thank ye kindly, doctor," says he. "you came in in about the nick, i
guess, for me and hawkins. and so it's you, ben gunn!" he added. "well,
you're a nice one, to be sure."

"i'm ben gunn, i am," replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his
embarrassment. "and," he added, after a long pause, "how do, mr. silver?
pretty well, i thank ye, says you."

"ben, ben," murmured silver, "to think as you've done me!"

the doctor sent back gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their
flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to
where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had tak
 
 ___________________________
 
en place.
it was a story that profoundly interested silver; and ben gunn, the
half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end.

ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the
skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he
had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the
excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from
the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at
the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in
safety since two mo
 
 ___________________________
 
nths before the arrival of the hispaniola.

when the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the
attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone
to silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the
stores, for ben gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted
by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in
safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of
malaria and keep a guard upon the money.

"as for you, jim," he said, "it went against my heart, but i did what i
thought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not
one of these, whose fault was it?"

that morning, finding that i was to be involved in the horrid
disappointment he had pr

epared for the mutineers, he had run all the way
to the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken gray
and the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be
at hand beside the pine. soon, however, he saw that our party had the
start of him; and ben gunn, being fleet of foot, had been dispatched in
front to do his best alone. then it had occurred to him to work upon the
superstitions of his former shipmates, and he was so far successful that
gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the
arrival of the treasure-hunters.

"ah," said silver, "it were fortunate for me that i had hawkins here.
you would have let old john be cut to bits, and never given it a
thought, doctor."

"not a thought," replied dr. livesey cheerily.

and

farther, just inside the mouth of north inlet, what should
we meet but the hispaniola, cruising by herself? the last flood had
lifted her, and had there been much wind or a strong tide current, as
in the southern anchorage, we should never have found her more, or found
her stranded beyond help. as it was, there was little amiss beyond the
wreck of the main-sail. another anchor was got ready and dropped in a
fathom and a half of water. we all pulled round again to rum cove,
the nearest point for ben gunn's treasure-house; and then gray,
single-handed, returned with the gig to the hispaniola, where he was to
pass the night on guard.

a gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave. at the
top, the squire met us. to me he was cordial and kind, saying nothing
of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise. at silver's polite
salute he somewhat flushed.

"john silver," he said, "you're a prodigious villain and imposter--a
monstrous imposter, sir. i am told i am not to prosecut

en his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in
vain to share in the reward.

"come in, jim," said the captain. "you're a good boy in your line, jim,
but i don't think you and me'll go to sea again. you're too much of the
born favourite for me. is that you, john silver? what brings you here,
man?"

"come back to my dooty, sir," returned silver.

"ah!" said the captain, and that was all he said.

what a supper i had of it that night, with all my friends around me; and
what a meal it was, with ben gunn's salted goat and some delicacies and
a bottle of old wine from the hispaniola. never, i am sure, were people
gayer or happier. and there was silver, sitting back almost out of the
firelight, but eating heartily, prompt to spring forward when anything
was wanted, even joining quietly in our laughter--the same bland,
polite, obsequious seaman of the voyage out.

and last

the next morning we fell early to work, for the transportation of this
great mass of gold near a mile by land to the b

each, and thence three
miles by boat to the hispaniola, was a considerable task for so small
a number of workmen. the three fellows still abroad upon the island did
not greatly trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was
sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught, and we thought,
besides, they had had more than enough of fighting.

therefore the work was pushed on briskly. gray and ben gunn came and
went with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled treasure
on the beach. two of the bars, slung in a rope's end, made a good load
for a grown man--one that he was glad to walk slowly with. for my part,
as i was not much use at carrying, i was kept busy all day in the cave
packing the minted money into bread-bags.

it was a strange collection, like billy bones's hoard for the diversity
of coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied that i think i
never had more plea

heaven forgive them," said the doctor; "'tis the mutineers!"

"all drunk, sir," struck in the voice of silver from behind us.

silver, i should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in spite of
daily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged
and friendly dependent. indeed, it was remarkable how well he bore
these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to
ingratiate himself with all. yet, i think, none treated him better than
a dog, unless it was ben gunn, who was still terribly afraid of his old
quartermaster, or myself, who had really something to thank him for;
although for that matter, i suppose, i had reason to think even worse of
him than anybody else, for i had seen him meditating a fresh treachery
upon the plateau. accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor
answered him.

"drunk or raving," said he.

"right you were, sir," replied silver; "and precious little odds which,
to you and me."

"i suppose you would hardly ask me to call

s i know what i owes you. but these men down
there, they couldn't keep their word--no, not supposing they wished to;
and what's more, they couldn't believe as you could."

"no," said the doctor. "you're the man to keep your word, we know that."

well, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates. only
once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting.
a council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the
island--to the huge glee, i must say, of ben gunn, and with the strong
approval of gray. we left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk
of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools,
clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular
desire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco.

that was about our last doing on the island. before that, we had got the
treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the
goat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we

 (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical
fruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a
most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island;
and the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore
to pass the early part of the night. here they met the captain of an
english man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and,
in short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came
alongside the hispaniola.

ben gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began,
with wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. silver was gone.
the maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago,
and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which
would certainly have been forfeit if "that man with the one leg
had stayed aboard." but this was not all. the sea-cook had not gone
empty-handed. he had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed
one of the sacks of coin

 bad a case as that other ship they sang about:

     with one man of her crew alive,
     what put to sea with seventy-five.

all of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or
foolishly, according to our natures. captain smollett is now retired
from the sea. gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit
with the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now
mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the
father of a family. as for ben gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he
spent or lost in three weeks, or to be more exact, in nineteen days, for
he was back begging on the twentieth. then he was given a lodge to keep,
exactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great
favourite, though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a
notable singer in church on sundays and saints' days.

of silver we have heard no more. that formidable seafaring man with one
leg has at last gone clean out of my life; but i dar
