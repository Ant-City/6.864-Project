[CHARACTER]
pierre, whom many critics regard as a reflection of tolstoy
himself, attracts our sympathy in his status as an outsider to the
russian upper classes. his simplicity and emotional directness contrast
with the artificiality of fakes such as the kuragins. though the
attendees at anna pavlovna's party consider pierre uncouth and awkward, this
very awkwardness emphasizes his natural unpretentiousness. we see
his love of fun in his expulsion from st. petersburg for excessive
partying, and his generosity in his bank-breaking largesse toward
friends and acquaintances following his inheritance. pierre, though
intelligent, is not dominated by reason, as his friend andrew is.
pierre's emotional spurts occasionally get him into trouble, as when
his sexual passions make him prey to the self-serving and beautiful
helene. his madcap escape into the city of moscow and his subsequent
obsessive belief that he is destined to be napoleon's assassin show
his submission to irrational impulses. yet there is also a great
nobility in pierre's emotions, and his search for meaning in his
life becomes a central theme of the novel. we feel that his final marriage
to natasha represents the culmination of a life of moral and spiritual
questioning.
