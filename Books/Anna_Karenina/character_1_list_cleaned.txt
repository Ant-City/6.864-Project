[CHARACTER]  - 
anna's husband, a high-ranking government minister
and one of the most important men in st. petersburg. karenin is
formal and duty-bound. he is cowed by social convention and constantly
presents a flawless facade of a cultivated and capable man. there
is something empty about almost everything karenin does in the novel,
however: he reads poetry but has no poetic sentiments, he reads world
history but seems remarkably narrow-minded. he cannot be accused
of being a poor husband or father, but he shows little tenderness
toward his wife, anna, or his son, seryozha. he fulfills these family
roles as he does other duties on his list of social obligations. karenin's
primary motivation in both his career and his personal life is self-preservation.
when he unexpectedly forgives anna on what he believes may be her
deathbed, we see a hint of a deeper karenin ready to emerge. ultimately,
however, the bland bureaucrat remains the only karenin we know.
