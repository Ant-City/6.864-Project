 at the spring, and about a dozen wagons was 
already there. it was quick found it. he said the rive was up and still rising. 
he said it had already covered the highest water-mark on the bridge-piling he 
ever seen. "that bridge wont stand a whole lot water," i said. "has somebody 
told anse about it?" 

"i told him," quick said. "he says he reckons the boys has heard and 
unloaded and are on the way by now. he says they can load up and get across." 
"he better go on and bury her at new hope," armstid said. "that bridge is 
old. i wouldn't monkey with it." 

"his mind is set on taking her to jefferson," quick said. 

"then he better get at it soon as he can," armstid said. 

anse meets us at the door. he has shaved, but not good. there is a long 

cut on his jaw, and he is wearing his sunday pants and a white shirt with the 

neckband buttoned. it is drawn smooth over his hump, making it look bigger than 

ever, like a white shirt will, and his face is different too. he looks folks in

face wouldn't show. 

when we are going out, whitfield comes. he is wet and muddy to the waist, 

coming in. "the lord comfort this house," he says. "i was late because the 

bridge has gone. i went down to the old ford and swum my horse over, the lord 

protecting me. his grace be upon this house." 

we go back to the trestles and plank-ends and sit or squat. 

"i knowed it would go," armstid says. 

"it's been there a long time, that ere bridge," quick says. 

"the lord has kept it there, yon mean," uncle billy says. "i dont know ere 

a man that's touched hammer to it in twenty-five years." 

"how long has it been there, uncle billy?" quick says. 

"it was built in let me see it was in the year 1 888," 

uncle billy says. "i mind it because the first man to cross it was peabody 
coming to my house when jody was born." 

"if i'd a crossed it every time your wife littered since, it'

we laugh, suddenly loud, then suddenly quiet again. we look a little aside 
at one another. 

"lots of folks has crossed it that wont cross no more bridges," houston 
says. 

"it's a fact," littlejohn says. it's so." 

"one more aint, no ways," armstid says. "it'd taken them two-three days to 
got her to town in the wagon. they'd be gone a week, getting her to jefferson 
and back." 

"what's anse so itching to take her to jefferson for, anyway?" houston 
says. 

"he promised her," i say. "she wanted it. she come from there. her mind 
was set on it." 

"and anse is set on it, too," quick says. 

"ay," uncle billy says. "it's like a man that's let everything slide all 

his life to get set on something that will make the most trouble for everyb

he knows." 

"well, it'll take the lord to get her over that river now," peabody says. 
"anse cant do it." 

"and i reckon he will," quick says. "he's took care of anse a long time, 
now." 

"it's a fact," littlejohn says. 



"too long to quit now," armstid says. 

"i reckon he's like everybody else around here, uncle billy says. "he's 
done it so long now he cant quit." 

cash comes out. he has put on a clean shirt; his hair wet, is combed 

smooth down on his brow, smooth and black as if he had painted it onto his head, 

squats stiffly among us, we watching him. 

"you feeling this weather, aint you?" armstid says. 

cash says nothing. 

"a broke bone always feels it," littlejohn says. . fellow with a broke 
bone can tell it a-coming."

 cash got off with just a broke leg," armstid says. "he might have 
hurt himself bed-rid. how far'd you fall, cash?" 

"twenty-eight foot, four and a half inches, about," cash says. i move over 
beside him. 

"a fellow can sho slip quick on wet planks," quick says. 
"it's too bad," i say. "but you couldn't a holp it." 

"it's them durn women," he says. "i made it to balance with her. i made it 
to her measure and weight" 

if it takes wet boards for folks to fall, it's fixing to be lots of 
falling before this spell is done.

on the horse he rode up to armstid's and came back on the horse, leading 
arrnstid's team. we hitched up and laid cash on top of addie. when we laid him 
down he vomited again, but he got his head over the wagon bed in time. 
"he taken a lick in the stomach, too," vernon said. 
"the horse may have kicked him in the stomach too," i said. "did he kick 
you in the stomach, cash?" 

he tried to say something. dewey dell wiped his mouth again. 
"what's he say?" vernon said. 

"what is it, cash?" dewey dell said. she leaned down. "his

 tools," she 

said. vernon got them and put them into the wagon. dewey dell lifted cash's head 

so he could see. we drove on, dewey dell and i sitting beside cash to steady him 

and he riding on ahead on the horse. vernon stood watching us for a while. then 

he turned and went back toward the bridge. he walked gingerly, beginning to 

flap, the wet sleeves of his shirt as though he had just got wet. 

he was sitting the horse before the gate. armstid was waiting at the gate. 

we stopped and he got down and we lifted cash down and carried him into the 

house, where mrs armstid had the bed ready. we left her and dewey dell 

undressing him. 

we followed pa out to the wagon. he went back and got into the wagon and 
drove on, we following on foot, into the lot. the wetting had helped, because 
armstid said, "you're welcome to the house. you can put it there." he followed, 
leading the horse, and stood beside the wagon, the reins in his hand.

"i thank you," pa said. "we'll use in the shed yonder. i know it's a 
imposition on you." 

"you're welcome to the house," armstid said. he had that wooden look on 
his face again; that bold, surly, high-colored rigid look like his face and 
eyes were two colors of wood, the wrong one pale and the wrong one dark. his 
shirt was beginning to dry, but it still clung close upon him when he moved. 
"she would appreciate it," pa said. 

we took the team out and rolled the wagon bade under the shed. one side of 
the shed was open. 

"it wont rain under," armstid said. "but if you'd rather . . ."

them and propped them against the open side. 

"you're welcome to the house," armstid said. 

"i thank you," pa said. "i'd take it right kind if you'd give them a 

little snack." 

"sho," armstid said. "we'll have supper ready soon as she gets cash 
comfortable." he had gone back to the horse and he took taking the saddle off, 
his damp shirt lapping flat to him when he moved. 



pa wouldn't come in the house. "come in and eat," armstid said. "it's nigh 
ready." 

"i wouldn't crave nothing," pa said. "i thank you." 

"you come in and dry and eat," armstid said. "it'll be all right here." 

"it's for her," pa said. "it's for her sake i am taking the food. i got no 

team, no nothing. but she will be grateful to ere a one of you." 

"sho," armstid said. "you folks come in and dry." 

but after armstid gave pa a drink, he felt better, and when we went in to 

see about cash he hadn't come in with us. when i looked back he was lea

currycomb. then he returns and slips quickly past the single crashing thump and 

up against the horse, where it cannot overreach. he applies the curry-comb, 

holding himself within the horse's striking radius with the agility of an 

acrobat, cursing the horse in a whisper of obscene caress. its head flashes 

back, tooth -cropped; its eyes roll in the dusk like marbles on a gaudy velvet 

cloth as he strikes it upon the face with the back of the curry-comb.

but time i give him another sup of whisky and supper was about ready, he had 

done already bought a team from somebody, on a credit. picking and choosing he

nothing so-and-so owned, not even a hen coop. 

"you might try snopes," i said. "he's got three-four span. maybe one of 

them would suit you."

cash is sick. he is sick on the box. but my mother is a fish. 

"we got to get some medicine in mottson," pa says. "i reckon well just 

have to." 

"how do you feel, cash?" darl says. 

"it dont bother none," cash says. 

"do you want it propped a little higher?" darl says. 

cash has a broken leg. he has had two broken legs. he lies on the box with 

a quilt rolled under his head and a piece of wood under his knee. 

"i reckon we ought to left him at armstid's," pa says. 

i haven't got a broken leg and pa hasn't and darl hasn't and "it's just 

the bumps," cash says. "it kind of grinds together a little on a bump. it dont 

bother none." jewel has gone away. he and his horse went away one supper time 

"it's because she wouldn't have us beholden," pa says. "fore god, i do the 

best that ere a man" is it because jewel's mother is a horse darl? i said.

she lifts the package down and turns and disappears among the trees and

"they just aimed to ease hit some," he said.
