John Dowell - 
      The novel's narrator, John Dowell is the reader's only guide through the twisted story of the thirteen years the couple spent in France. He is a naive man, quickly taken in by appearances, and easily cuckolded by his wife* He tells the disjointed story of his own gradual understanding of what has occurred. Ultimately, he is a man who has lost all moral certitude, all comprehension of right and wrong. He is described by several literary critics as the quintessential "modern man."
