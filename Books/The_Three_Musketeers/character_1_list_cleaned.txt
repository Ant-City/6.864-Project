[CHARACTER] - 
      the most important of the three musketeers, [CHARACTER] is something of a father figure to d'artagnan. he is older than his comrades, although still a young man. [CHARACTER] is distinguished in every way--intellect, appearance, bravery, swordsmanship--yet he is tortured by a deep melancholy, the source of which no one knows.
