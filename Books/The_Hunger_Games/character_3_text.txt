the crack of dawn to trade for it. â€œwhat did it cost you?â€ 
â€œjust a squirrel. think the old man was feeling sentimental 
this morning,â€ says gale. â€œeven wished me luck.â€ 
â€œwell, we all feel a little closer today, donâ€™t we?â€ i say, not 
even bothering to roll my eyes. â€œprim left us a cheese.â€ i pull it 
out. his expression brightens at the treat. â€œthank you, prim. 
weâ€™ll have a real feast.â€ suddenly he falls into a capitol accent 
as he mimics effie trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who 
arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping. â€œi al-
most forgot! happy hunger games!â€ he plucks a few black-
berries from the bushes around us. â€œand may the odds â€”â€ he 
tosses a berry in a high arc toward me.

we all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the 
temporary stage that is set up before the justice building. it 
holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for 
the boys and one for the girls. i stare at the paper slips in the 
girlsâ€™ ball. twenty of them have katniss everdeen written on 
them in careful handwriting. 
two of the three chairs fill with madgeâ€™s father, mayor un-
dersee, whoâ€™s a tall, balding man, and effie trinket, district 
12â€™s escort, fresh from the capitol with her scary white grin, 
pinkish hair, and spring green suit. they murmur to each oth-
er and then look with concern at the empty seat. 
just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to 
the podium and begins to read. itâ€™s the same story every year. 
he tells of the history of panem, the country that rose up out 
of the ashes of a place that was once called north america. he 
lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires,

â€œit is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks,â€ in-
tones the mayor. 
then he reads the list of past district 12 victors. in seventy-
four years, we have had exactly two. only one is still alive.

confused and tries to give effie trinket a big hug, which she 
barely manages to fend off. 
the mayor looks distressed. since all of this is being tele-
vised, right now district 12 is the laughingstock of panem, and 
he knows it. he quickly tries to pull the attention back to the 
reaping by introducing effie trinket. 
bright and bubbly as ever, effie trinket trots to the podium 
and gives her signature, â€œhappy hunger games! and may the 
odds be ever in your favor!â€ her pink hair must be a wig be-
cause her curls have shifted sli

i spot gale looking back at me with a

entertainment factor. but suddenly i am thinking of gale and 
his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the odds

are not in his favor. not compared to a lot of the boys. and 
maybe heâ€™s thinking the same thing about me because his face

itâ€™s time for the drawing. effie trinket says as she always 
does, â€œladies first!â€ and crosses to the glass ball with the girlsâ€™ 
names. she reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball, and 
pulls out a slip of paper. the crowd draws in a collective 
breath and then you can hear a pin drop, and iâ€™m feeling nau-
seous and so desperately hoping that itâ€™s not me, that itâ€™s not 
me, that itâ€™s not me. 
effie trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip 
of paper, and reads out the name in a clear voice. and itâ€™s n

e is that once a tributeâ€™s name has been pulled from the 
ball, another eligible boy, if a boyâ€™s name has been read, or 
girl, if a girlâ€™s name has been read, can step forward to take his 
or her place. in some districts, in which winning the reaping is 
such a great honor, people are eager to risk their lives, the vo-
lunteering is complicated. but in district 12, where the word 
tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse, vo-
lunteers are all but extinct. 
â€œlovely!â€ says effie trinket. â€œbut i believe thereâ€™s a small 
matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for 
volunteers, and if one does come forth then we, um . . .â€ she 
trails off, unsure herself. 
â€œwhat does it matter?â€ says the mayor. heâ€™s looking at me 
with a pained expression on his face. he doesnâ€™t know me re-

brings the strawberries. the girl his daughter might have spo-

 replay of the 
reapings tonight, everyone will make note of my tears, and iâ€™ll 
be marked as an easy target. a weakling. i will give no one 
that satisfaction. â€œlet go!â€ 
i can feel someone pulling her from my back. i turn and see 
gale has lifted prim off the ground and sheâ€™s thrashing in his 
arms. â€œup you go, catnip,â€ he says, in a voice heâ€™s fighting to 
keep steady, and then he carries prim off toward my mother. i 
steel myself and climb the steps. 
â€œwell, bravo!â€ gushes effie trinket. â€œthatâ€™s the spirit of the 
games!â€ sheâ€™s pleased to finally have a district with a little ac-
tion going on in it. â€œwhatâ€™s your name?â€ 
i swallow hard. â€œkatniss everdeen,â€ i say. 
â€œi bet my buttons that was your sister. donâ€™t want her to 
steal all the glory, do we? come on, everybody! letâ€™s give a big 
round of applause to our newest tribute!â€ trills effie trinket.

choked sound in my throat and compose myself. i put my 
hands behind my back and stare into the distance. 
i can see the hills i climbed this morning with gale. for a 
moment, i yearn for something . . . the idea of us leaving the 
district . . . making our way in the woods . . . but i know i was 
right about not running off. because who else would have vo-
lunteered for prim? 
haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher, and effie trinket 
is trying to get the ball rolling again. â€œwhat an exciting day!â€ 
she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig, which has 
listed severely to the right. â€œbut more excitement to come! itâ€™s 
time to choose our boy tribute!â€ clearly hoping to contain her 
tenuous hair situation, she plants one hand on her head as she

his forehead. the shock of the moment is registering on his 
face, you can see his struggle to remain emotionless, but his 
blue eyes show the alarm iâ€™ve seen so often in prey. yet he 
climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place. 
effie trinket asks for volunteers, but no one steps forward. 
he has two older brothers, i know, iâ€™ve seen them in the ba-
kery, but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the 
other wonâ€™t. this is standard. family devotion only goes so far 
for most people on reaping day. what i did was the radical 
thing. the mayor begins to read the long, dull treaty of treason 
as he does every year at this point â€” itâ€™s required â€” but iâ€™m 
not listening to a word. 
why  him? i think. then i try to convi

time thinking about it. whatever the truth is, i donâ€™t see how it 
will help me get food on the table. 
the tribute train is fancier than even the room in the jus-
tice building. we are each given our own chambers that have 
a bedroom, a dressing area, and a private bathroom with hot 
and cold running water. we donâ€™t have hot water at home, un-
less we boil it. 
there are drawers filled with fine clothes, and effie trinket 
tells me to do anything i want, wear anything i want, every-
thing is at my disposal. just be ready for supper in an hour. i 
peel off my motherâ€™s blue dress and take a hot shower. iâ€™ve 
never had a shower before. itâ€™s like being in a summer rain, 
only warmer. i dress in a dark green shirt and pants. 
at the last minute, i remember madgeâ€™s little gold pin. for 
the first time, i get a good look at it. itâ€™s as if someone fa-
shioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around

 would fall silent and listen. 
his voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with 
life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time. i could 
never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone. 
still, thereâ€™s something comforting about the little bird. itâ€™s 
like having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. i fas-
ten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a 
background, i can almost imagine the mockingjay flying 
through the trees. 
effie trinket comes to collect me for supper. i follow her 
through the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining room with 
polished paneled walls. thereâ€™s a table where all the dishes

are highly breakable. peeta mellark sits waiting for us, the 
chair next to him empty. 
â€œwhereâ€™s haymitch?â€ asks effie trinket brightly. 
â€œlast time i saw him, he said he was going to take a nap,â€ 
says peeta. 
â€œwell, itâ€™s been an exhausting day,â€ says effie trinket. i 
think sheâ€™s relieved by hay

the supper comes in courses. a thick carrot soup, green 
salad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a 
chocolate cake. throughout the meal, effie trinket keeps re-
minding us to save space because thereâ€™s more to come. but 
iâ€™m stuffing myself because iâ€™ve never had food like this, so 
good and so much, and because probably the best thing i can 
do between now and the games is put on a few pounds. 
â€œat least, you two have decent manners,â€ says effie as weâ€™re 
finishing the main course. â€œthe pair last year ate everything 
with their hands like a couple of savages. it completely upset 
my digestion.â€

i hate effie trinketâ€™s comment so much i make a point of eat-

bark â€” a winter specialty â€” iâ€™m determined to hang

stage. the commentators are not sure what to say about the 
crowdâ€™s refusal to applaud. the silent salute. one says that 
district 12 has always been a bit backward but that local cus-
toms can be charming. as if on cue, haymitch falls off the 
stage, and they groan comically. peetaâ€™s name is drawn, and he 
quietly takes his place. we shake hands. they cut to the an-
them again, and the pro-gram ends. 
effie trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in. 
â€œyour mentor has a lot to learn about presentation. a lot about 
televised behavior.â€ 
peeta unexpectedly laughs. â€œhe was drunk,â€ says peeta. 
â€œheâ€™s drunk every year.â€ 
â€œevery day,â€ i add. i canâ€™t help smirking a little. effie trinket 
makes it sound like haymitch just has somewhat rough man-
ners that could be corrected with a few tips from her. 
â€œyes,â€ hisses effie trinket. â€œhow odd you two find it amus-

just then, haymitch staggers into the compartment. â€œi miss 
supper?â€ he says in a slurred voice. then he vomits all over 
the expensive carpet and falls in the mess. 
â€œso laugh away!â€ says effie trinket. she hops in her pointy 
shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the room.

  for a few moments, peeta and i take in the scene of our 
mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his 
stomach. the reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my 
dinner up. we exchange a glance. obviously haymitch isnâ€™t 
much, but effie trinket is right about one thing, once weâ€™re in 
the arena heâ€™s all weâ€™ve got. as if by some unspoken agree-
ment, peeta and i each take one o

if iâ€™m going to cry, now is the time to do it. by morning, iâ€™ll 
be able to wash the damage done by the tears from my face. 
but no tears come. iâ€™m too tired or too numb to cry. the only 
thing i feel is a desire to be somewhere else. so i let the train 
rock me into oblivion. 
gray light is leaking through the curtains when the rapping 
rouses me. i hear effie trinketâ€™s voice, calling me to rise. â€œup, 
up, up! itâ€™s going to be a big, big, big day!â€ i try and imagine, 
for a moment, what it must be like inside that womanâ€™s head. 
what thoughts fill her waking hours? what dreams come to 
her at night? i have no idea. 
i put the green outfit back on since itâ€™s not really dirty, just 
slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor. my 
fingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and i 
think of the woods, and of my father, and

i slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the

doesnâ€™t matter. we canâ€™t be far from the capitol now. and 
once we reach the city, my stylist will dictate my look for the 
opening ceremonies tonight anyway. i just hope i get one who 
doesnâ€™t think nudity is the last word in fashion. 
as i enter the dining car, effie trinket brushes by me with a 
cup of black coffee. sheâ€™s muttering obscenities under her 
breath. haymitch, his face puffy and red from the previous 
dayâ€™s indulgences, is chuckling. peeta holds a roll and looks 
somewhat embarrassed. 
â€œsit down! sit down!â€ says haymitch, waving me over. the 
moment i slide into my chair iâ€™m served an enormous platter 
of food. eggs, ham, piles of fried potatoes. a tureen of fruit sits 
in ice to keep it chilled. the basket of rolls they set before me

iâ€™ve ridden the elevator a couple of times in the justice 
building back in district 12. once to receive the medal for my 
fatherâ€™s death and then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to 
my friends and family. but thatâ€™s a dark and creaky thing that 
moves like a snail and smells of sour milk. the walls of this 
elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people 
on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air. 
itâ€™s exhilarating and iâ€™m tempted to ask effie trinket if we can 
ride it again, but somehow that seems childish. 
apparently, effie trinketâ€™s duties did not conclude at the 
station. she and haymitch will be overseeing us right into the 
arena. in a way, thatâ€™s a plus because at least she can be 
counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we 
havenâ€™t seen haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train.

â€œunfortunately, i canâ€™t seal the sponsor deals for you. only

get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary.â€ 
although lacking in many departments, effie trinket has a 
certain determination i have to admire. 
my quarters are larger than our entire house back home. 
they are plush, like the train car, but also have so many auto-
matic gadgets that iâ€™m sure i wonâ€™t have time to press all the 
buttons. the shower alone has a panel with more than a hun-

donâ€™t know what she showed the judges, but sheâ€™s so tiny it 
must have been impressive. 
district 12 comes up last, as usual. peeta pulls an eight so at 
least a couple of the gamemakers must have been watching 
him. i dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up, 
expecting the worst. then theyâ€™re flashing the number eleven 
on the screen. 
eleven! 
effie trinket lets out a squeal, and everybody is slapping 
me on the back and cheering and congratulating me. but it 
doesnâ€™t seem real. 
â€œthere must be a mistake. how . . . how could that happen?â€ 
i ask haymitch. 
â€œguess they liked your temper,â€ he says. â€œtheyâ€™ve got a 
show to put on. they need some players with some heat.â€

â€œweâ€™ll earn it back today,â€ i say, and we both plow into our 
plates. even cold, itâ€™s one of the best things iâ€™ve ever tasted. i 
abandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my 
finger. â€œi can feel effie trinket shuddering at my manners.â€ 
â€œhey, effie, watch this!â€ says peeta. he tosses his fork over 
his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue 
making loud, satisfied sounds. then he blows a kiss out to her

i cover his mouth with my hand, but iâ€™m laughing. â€œstop!
