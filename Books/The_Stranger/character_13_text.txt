i entered the mortuary. it was a bright, spotlessly clean room, with whitewashed
walls and a big skylight. the furniture consisted of some chairs and trestles. two of
the latter stood open in the center of the room and the coffin rested on them. the lid

stuck  out  above  the  wood,  which  was  stained  dark  walnut.  an  arab  womanâ€”a
nurse, i supposedâ€”was sitting beside the bier; she was wearing a blue smock and
had a rather gaudy scarf wound round her hair.

just then the keeper came up behind me. heâ€™d evidently been running, as he was a

little out of breath.

that  inmates  shouldnâ€™t  attend  funerals,  though  there  was  no
objection to letting some of them sit up beside the coffin, the night before.

â€œitâ€™s  for  their  own  sakes,â€  he  explained,  â€œto  spare  their  feelings.  but  in  this
particular  instance  iâ€™ve  given  permission  to  an  old  friend  of  your  mother  to  come
with us. his name is thomas pÃ©rez.â€ the warden smiled. â€œitâ€™s a rather touching little
story in its way. he and your mother had become almost inseparable. the other old
people  used  to  tease  pÃ©rez  about  having  a  fiancÃ©e.  â€˜when  are  you  going  to  marry
her?â€™ theyâ€™d ask. heâ€™d turn it with a laugh. it was a standing joke, in fact. so, as you
can  guess,  he  feels  very  badly  about  your  motherâ€™s  death.  i  thought  i  couldnâ€™t
decently refuse him permission to attend the funeral. but, on our medical officerâ€™s
advice, i forbade him to sit up beside the body last night.â€

for some time we sat there without speaking

 hard at it all the
afternoon. so it came as a relief when we closed down and i was strolling slowly
along the wharves in the coolness. the sky was green, and it was pleasant to be out-
of-doors after the stuffy office. however, i went straight home, as i had to put some
potatoes on to boil.

the hall was dark and, when i was starting up the stairs, i almost bumped into old
salamano, who lived on the same floor as i. as usual, he had his dog with him. for
eight  years  the  two  had  been  inseparable.  salamanoâ€™s  spaniel  is  an  ugly  brute,

afflicted with some skin diseaseâ€”mange, i suspect; anyhow, it has lost all its hair
and its body is covered with brown scabs. perhaps through living in one small room,
cooped up with his dog, salamano has come to resemble it. his towy hair has gone
very  thin,  and  he  has  reddish  blotches  on  his  face.  and  the  dog  has  developed
something of its masterâ€™s queer hunched-up gait; it always ha

ed that she could come, too. in fact, his
friendâ€™s wife would be very pleased not to be the only woman in a party of men.

iâ€™d have liked to hang up at once, as my employer doesnâ€™t approve of my using the
office phone for private calls. but raymond asked me to hold on; he had something
else to tell me, and that was why heâ€™d rung me up, though he could have waited till
the evening to pass on the invitation.

â€œitâ€™s like this,â€ he said. â€œiâ€™ve been shadowed all the morning by some arabs. one
of themâ€™s the brother of that girl i had the row with. if you see him hanging round the
house when you come back, pass me the word.â€

i promised to do so.
just then my employer sent for me. for a moment i felt uneasy, as i expected he
was going to tell me to stick to my work and not waste time chattering with friends
over the phone. however, it was nothing of the kind. he wanted to discuss a project
he had in view, though so far heâ€™d come to no decision. it was to open a branch at

e as â€œmademoiselle.â€

on the previous evening we had visited the police station, where i gave evidence
for raymondâ€”about the girlâ€™s having been false to him. so they let him off with a
warning. they didnâ€™t check my statement.

after some talk on the doorstep we decided to take the bus. the beach was within
easy walking distance, but the sooner we got there the better. just as we were starting
for the bus stop, raymond plucked my sleeve and told me to look across the street. i
saw some arabs lounging against the tobacconistâ€™s window. they were staring at us
silently, in the special way these people haveâ€”as if we were blocks of stone or dead
trees. raymond whispered that the second arab from the left was â€œhis man,â€ and i
thought he looked rather worried however, he assured me that all that was ancient
history. marie, who hadnâ€™t followed his remarks, asked, â€œwhat is it?â€

i explained that those arabs across the way had a grudge against raymond. she
insisted on our goin

g at once. then raymond  laughed,  and  squared  his  shoulders.
the young lady was quite right, he said. there was no point in hanging about here.
halfway  to  the  bus  stop  he  glanced  back  over  his  shoulder  and  said  the  arabs
werenâ€™t following. i, too, looked back. they were exactly as before, gazing in the
same vague way at the spot where we had been.

when we were in the bus, raymond, who now seemed quite at ease, kept making
jokes to amuse marie. i could see he was attracted by her, but she had hardly a word
for him. now and again she would catch my eye and smile.

we alighted just outside algiers. the beach is not far from the bus stop; one has
only  to  cross  a  p

rst  raymond  and  masson  talked  of  things  and  people  i  didnâ€™t  know.  i
gathered that theyâ€™d been acquainted for some time and had even lived together for a
while. we went down to the waterâ€™s edge and walked along it; now and then a longer
wave wet our canvas shoes. i wasnâ€™t thinking of anything, as all that sunlight beating
down on my bare head made me feel half asleep.

just then raymond said something to masson that i didnâ€™t quite catch. but at the
same moment i noticed two arabs in blue dungarees a long way down the beach,
coming  in  our  direction.  i  gave  raymond  a  look  and  he  nodded,  saying,  â€œthatâ€™s
him.â€  we  walked  steadily  on.  masson  wondered  how  theyâ€™d  managed  to  track  us
here. my impression was that they had seen us taking the bus and noticed marieâ€™s
oilcloth bathing bag; but i didnâ€™t say anything.

though the arabs walked quite slowly, they were much nearer already. we didnâ€™t

change our pace, but raymond said:

â€œlisten! if

 thereâ€™s a roughhouse, you, masson, take on the second one. iâ€™ll tackle
the  fellow  whoâ€™s  after  me.  and  you,  meursault,  stand  by  to  help  if  another  one
comes up, and lay him out.â€

i said, â€œright,â€ and masson put his hands in his pockets.
the  sand  was  as  hot  as  fire,  and  i  could  have  sworn  it  was  glowing  red.  the
distance between us and the arabs was steadily decreasing. when we were only a
few steps away the arabs halted. masson and i slowed down, while raymond went
straight up to his man. i couldnâ€™t hear what he said, but i saw the native lowering his
head,  as  if  to  butt  him  in  the  chest.  raymond  lashed  out  promptly  and  shouted  to
masson to come. masson went up to the man he had been marking and struck him
twice with all his might. the fellow fell flat into the water and stayed there some
seconds with bubbles coming up to the surface round his head. meanwhile raymond
had been slogging

the other man, whose face was streaming with blood. he glanced
at me over his shoulder and shouted:

â€œjust you watch! i ainâ€™t finished with him yet!â€
â€œlook out!â€ i cried. â€œheâ€™s got a knife.â€



35

albert camus (cid:153) the stranger

i spoke too late. the man had gashed raymondâ€™s arm and his mouth as well.
masson sprang forward. the other arab got up from the water and placed himself
behind the fellow with the knife. we didnâ€™t dare to move. the two natives backed
away  slowly,  keeping  us  at  bay  with  the  knife  and  never  taking  their  eyes  off  us.
when  they  were  at  a  safe  distance  they  swung  round  and  took  to  their  heels.  we
stood  stock-still,  with  the  sunlight  beating  down  on  us.  blood  was  dripping  from
raymondâ€™s wounded arm, which he was squeezing hard above the elbow.

masson remarked that

sson said we mustnâ€™t insist, seeing the state he was in.
however, when he went out, i followed him.

it was like a furnace outside, with the sunlight splintering into flakes of fire on the
sand and sea. we walked for quite a while, and i had an idea that raymond had a
definite idea where he was going; but probably i was mistaken about this.

at the end of the beach we came to a small stream that had cut a channel in the
sand, after coming out from behind a biggish rock. there we found our two arabs
again, lying on the sand in their blue dungarees. they looked harmless enough, as if
they didnâ€™t bear any malice, and neither made any move when we approached. the
man who had slashed raymond stared at him without speaking. the other man was
blowing down a little reed and extracting from it three notes of the scale, which he
played over and over again, while he watched us from the corner of an eye.

for a while nobody moved; it was all sunlight and silence except for the tinkle of
the stream

 and those three little lonely sounds. then raymond put his hand to his
revolver  pocket,  but  the  arabs  still  didnâ€™t  move.  i  noticed  the  man  playing  on  the
reed had his big toes splayed out almost at right angles to his feet.

still keeping his eyes on his man, raymond said to me: â€œshall i plug him one?â€



36

albert camus (cid:153) the stranger

i thought quickly. if i told him not to, considering the mood he was in, he might
very well fly into a temper and use his gun. so i said the first thing that came into my
head.

â€œhe hasnâ€™t spoken to you yet. it would be a lowdown t

rick to shoot him like that,

in cold blood.â€

again, for some moments one heard nothing but the tinkle of the stream and the

flute notes weaving through the hot, still air.

â€œwell,â€  raymond  said  at  last,  â€œif  thatâ€™s  how  you  feel,  iâ€™d  better  say  something

insulting, and if he answers back iâ€™ll loose off.â€

â€œright,â€ i said. â€œonly, if he doesnâ€™t get out his knife youâ€™ve no business to fire.â€
raymond was beginning to fidget. the arab with the reed went on playing, and

both of them watched all our movements.

â€œlisten,â€ i said to raymond. â€œyou take on the fellow on the right, and give me
your revolver. if the other one starts making trouble or gets out his knife, iâ€™ll shoot.â€
the sun glinted on raymondâ€™s revolver as he handed it to me. but nobody made a
move yet; it was just as if everything had closed in on us so that we couldnâ€™t stir. we
could only watch each other, never lowering our eyes; the whole world se

emed to
have come to a standstill on this little strip of sand between the sunlight and the sea,
the twofold silence of the reed and stream. and just then it crossed my mind that one
might fire, or not fireâ€”and it would come to absolutely the same thing.

then, all of a sudden, the arabs vanished; theyâ€™d slipped like lizards under cover
of  the  rock.  so  raymond  and  i  turned  and  walked  back.  he  seemed  happier,  and
began talking about the bus to catch for our return.

when  we  reached  the  bungalow  raymond  promptly  went  up  the  wooden  steps,
but i halted on the bottom one. the light seemed thudding in my head and i couldnâ€™t
face the effort needed to go up the steps and make myself amiable to the women. but
the heat was so great that it was just as bad st

the small black hump of rock came into view far down the beach. it was rimmed
by a dazzling sheen of light and feathery spray, but i was thinking of the cold, clear

stream behind it, and longing to hear again the tinkle of running water. anything to
be rid of the glare, the sight of women in tears, the strain and effortâ€”and to retrieve
the pool of shadow by the rock and its cool silence!

but  when  i  came  nearer  i  saw  that  raymondâ€™s  arab  had  returned.  he  was  by
himself this time, lying on his back, his hands behind his head, his face shaded by the
rock while the sun beat on the rest of his body. one could see his dungarees steaming
in the heat. i was rather taken aback; my impression had been that the incident was
closed, and i hadnâ€™t given a thought to it on my way here.

on seeing me, the arab raised himself a little, and his hand went to his pocket.
naturally, i gripped raymondâ€™s revolver in the pocket of my coat. t

hen the arab let
himself sink back again, but without taking  his  hand  from  his pocket.  i  was  some
distance off, at least ten yards, and most of the time i saw him as a blurred dark form
wobbling in the heat haze. sometimes, however, i had glimpses of his eyes glowing
between the half-closed lids. the sound of the waves was even lazier, feebler, than at
noon. but the light hadnâ€™t changed; it was pounding as fiercely as ever on the long
stretch of sand that ended at the rock. for two hours the sun se

emed to have made no
progress; becalmed in a sea of molten steel. far out on the horizon a steamer was
passing;  i  could  just  make  out  from  the  corner  of  an  eye  the  small  black  moving
patch, while i kept my gaze fixed on the arab.

it struck me that all i had to do was to turn, walk away, and think no more about it.
but the whole beach, pulsing with heat, was pressing on my back. i took some steps
toward  the  stream.  the  arab  didnâ€™t  move.  after  all,  there  was  still  some  distance
between us. perhaps because of the shadow on his face, he seemed to be grinning at
me.

i  waited.  the  heat  was  beginning  to  scorch  my  cheeks;  beads  of  sweat  were
gathering  in  my  eyebrows.  it  was  just  the  same  sort  of  heat  as  at  my  motherâ€™s
funeral,  and  i  had  the  same  disagreeable  sensationsâ€”especially  in  my  forehead,
where all the veins seemed to be bursting through the skin. i couldnâ€™t

stand it any
longer, and took another step forward. i knew it was a fool thing to do; i wouldnâ€™t get
out of the sun by moving on a yard or so. but i took that step, just one step, forward.
and then the arab drew his knife and held it up toward me, athwart the sunlight.

a  shaft  of  light  shot  upward  from  the  steel,  and  i  felt  as  if  a  long,  thin  blade
transfixed my forehead. at the same moment all the sweat that had accumulated in
my  eyebrows  splashed  down  on  my  eyelids,  covering  them  with  a  warm  film  of
moisture. beneath a veil of brine and tears my eyes were blinded; i was conscious
only of the cymbals of the sun clashing on my skull, and, less distinctly, of the keen

eing in prison; i had always a
vague hope that something would turn up, some agreeable surprise.

the change came soon after marieâ€™s first and only visit. from the day when i got
her  letter  telling  me  they  wouldnâ€™t  let  her  come  to  see  me  any  more,  because  she
wasnâ€™t my wifeâ€”it was from that day that i realized that this cell was my last home,
a dead end, so to speak.

on  the  day  of  my  arrest  they  put  me  in  a  biggish  room  with  several  other
prisoners, mostly arabs. they grinned when they saw me enter, and asked me what
iâ€™d  done.  i  told  them  iâ€™d  killed  an  arab,  and  they  kept  mum  for  a  while.  but
presently night began to fall, and one of them explained to me how to lay out my
sleeping mat. by rolling up one end one makes a sort of bolster. all night i felt bugs
crawling over my face.

some days later i was put by myself in a cell, where i slept on a plank bed hinged
to the wall. the only other furniture was a latrine bucket and a tin b

itorsâ€™ room, i was taken along a corridor, then up a flight of steps,
then along another corridor. it was a very large room, lit by a big bow window, and
divided into three compartments by high iron grilles running transversally. between
the two grilles there was a gap of some thirty feet, a sort of no manâ€™s land between
the prisoners and their friends. i was led to a point exactly opposite marie, who was
wearing her striped dress. on my side of the rails were about a dozen other prisoners,
arabs  for  the  most  part.  on  marieâ€™s  side  were  mostly  moorish  women.  she  was
wedged between a small old woman with tight-set lips and a fat matron, without a
hat,  who  was  talking  shrilly  and  gesticulated  all  the  time.  because  of  the  distance
between the visitors and prisoners i found i, too, had to raise my voice.

when i came into the room the babel of voices echoing on the bare walls, and the
sunlight streaming in, flooding everything in a harsh white glare, made me feel

the woman beside me was still yelling away, telling her husband that sheâ€™d left a
basket for him in the prison office. she gave a list of the things sheâ€™d brought and
told  him  to  mind  and  check  them  carefully,  as  some  had  cost  quite  a  lot.  the
youngster  on  my  other  side  and  his  mother  were  still  gazing  mournfully  at  each

other, and the murmur of the arabs droned on below us. the light outside seemed to
be surging up against the window, seeping  through, and smearing the faces of the
people facing it with a coat of yellow oil.

i began to feel slightly squeamish, and wished i could leave. the strident voice
beside me was jarring on my ears. but, on the other hand, i wanted to have the most i
could of marieâ€™s company. iâ€™ve no idea how much time passed. i remember marieâ€™s
describing to me her work, with that set smile always on her face. the

re wasnâ€™t a
momentâ€™s  letup  in  the  noiseâ€”shouts,  conversations,  and  always  that  muttering
undertone.  the  only  oasis  of  silence  was  made  by  the  young  fellow  and  the  old
woman gazing into each otherâ€™s eyes.

then, one by one, the arabs were led away; almost everyone fell silent when the
first one left. the little old woman pressed herself against the bars and at the same
moment  a  jailer  tapped  her  sonâ€™s  shoulder.  he  called,  â€œau  revoir,  mother,â€  and,
slipping her hand between the bars, she gave him a small, slow wave with it.

no sooner was she gone than a man, hat in hand, took her place. a prisoner was
led  up  to  the  empty  place  beside  me,  and  the  two  started  a  brisk  exchange  of
remarksâ€”not

that matter, of anybody else; so both of us had got used to the new conditions easily
enough. the judge then said that he had no wish to press the point, and asked the
prosecutor if he could think of any more questions that should be put to me at this
stage.

the prosecutor, who had his back half turned to me, said, without looking in my
direction, that, subject to his honorâ€™s approval, he would like to know if iâ€™d gone
back to the stream with the intention of killing the arab. i said, â€œno.â€ in that case,
why had i taken a revolver with me, and why go back precisely to that spot? i said it
was a matter of pure chance. the prosecutor then observed in a nasty tone: â€œvery
good. that will be all for the present.â€

i couldnâ€™t quite follow what came next. anyhow, after some palavering among the
bench, the prosecutor, and my counsel, the presiding judge announced that the court
would now rise; there was an adjournment till the afternoon, when evidence would

room and subject her to ill-treatment by a man â€œof more than dubious reputation.â€
then, on the beach, iâ€™d provoked a brawl with raymondâ€™s enemies, in the course of



62

albert camus (cid:153) the stranger

which  raymond  was  wounded.  iâ€™d  asked  him  for  his  revolver  and  gone  back  by
myself with the intention of using it. then iâ€™d shot the arab. after the first shot i
waited.  then,  â€œto  be  certain  of  making  a  good  job  of  it,â€  i  fired  four  more  shots
deliberately, point-blank, and in cold blood, at my victim.

â€œthat is my case,â€ he said. â€œi have described to you the series of events which led
this  man  to  kill  the  deceased,  fully  aware  of  what  he  was  doing.  i  emphasize  this
point. we are not concerned with an act of homicide committed on a sudden impulse
which might serve as extenuation. i ask you

righteous  indignation  i  feel  at  the  sight  of  a  criminal  devoid  of  the  least  spark  of

when the prosecutor sat down there was a longish silence. personally i was quite
overcome by the heat and my amazement at what i had been hearing. the presiding
judge gave a short cough, and asked me in a very low tone if i had anything to say. i
rose, and as i felt in the mood to speak, i said the first thing that crossed my mind:
that iâ€™d had no intention of killing the arab. the judge replied that this statement
would be taken into consideration by the court. meanwhile he would be glad to hear,
before my counsel addressed the court, what were the motives of my crime. so far,
he must admit, he hadnâ€™t fully understood the grounds of my defense.

i tried to explain that it was because of the sun, but i spoke too quickly and ran my
words into each other. i was only too conscious that it sounded nonsensical, and, in
fact, i heard people tittering.

my lawyer shrugged

i said: â€œyes.â€
he dropped his eyes and sat down again. he was truly sorry for me, he said. it

must make life unbearable for a man, to think as i did.

the  priest  was  beginning  to  bore  me,  and,  resting  a  shoulder  on  the  wall,  just
beneath the little skylight, i looked away. though i didnâ€™t trouble much to follow
what  he  said,  i  gathered  he  was  questioning  me  again.  presently  his  tone  became
agitated, urgent, and, as i realized that he was genuinely distressed, i began to pay
more attention.

he said he felt convinced my appeal would succeed, but i was saddled with a load
of guilt, o
