Henry Bolingbroke Duke of Herford  - 
      
        In some texts, thanks to the vagaries of Renaissance spelling, Bolingbroke is called "Bullingbrook," and Herford is "Hereford." He is also occasionally referred to by his nickname, "Harry." Bolingbroke is King Richard's cousin and the son of Richard's uncle, John of Gaunt. He is less poetic but far more pragmatic and capable than his cousin. He returns from his banishment abroad, sways the loyalties of both the English nobility and the common people to his side, and stages a revolution against Richard II. He is eventually crowned King Henry IV.
