 realized that of the
numerous  reverberations  following  from  the  revelations  of  special  relativity,  one  was  especially
profound: the dictum that nothing can outrun light proves to be incompatible with newton's revered
universal  theory  of  gravity,  proposed  in  the  latter  half  of  the  seventeenth  century. and  so,  while
resolving one conflict, special relativity gave rise to another. after a decade of intense, sometimes
tormented study, einstein resolved the dilemma with his general theory of relativity. in this theory,
einstein once again revolutionized our understanding of space and time by showing that they warp
and distort to communicate the force of gravity.

newton's view of gravity

isaac  newton,  born  in  1642  in  lincolnshire,  england,  changed  the  face  of  scientific  research  by
bringing  the  full  force  of  mathematics  to  the  service  of  physical  inquiry.  newton's  was  such  a
monumental intellect that, for example, when he found that the mathematics required for s

what is the fundamental principle underlying string theory?

one  overarching  lesson  we  have  learned  during  the  past  hundred  years  is  that  the  known  laws  of
physics  are  associated  with  principles  of  symmetry.  special  relativity  is  based  on  the  symmetry
embodied in the principle of relativity—the symmetry between all constant-velocity vantage points.
the gravitational force, as embodied in the general theory of relativity, is based on the equivalence

principle—the  extension  of  the  principle  of  relativity  to  embrace  all  possible  vantage  points
regardless  of  the  complexity  of  their  states  of  motion. and  the  strong,  weak,  and  electromagnetic
forces are based on the more abstract gauge symmetry principles.

physicists, as we have discussed, tend to elevate symmetry principles to a place of prominence
by putting them squarely on the pedestal of explanation. gravity, in this view, exists i
