uring the past hundred years. in fact, we shall
see that the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics is actually not the first, but the
third in a sequence of pivotal conflicts encountered during the past century, each of whose resolution
has resulted in a stunning revision of our understanding of the universe.

the three conflicts

the first conflict, recognized as far back as the late 1800s, concerns puzzling properties of the motion
of light. briefly put, according to isaac newton's laws of motion, if you run fast enough you can catch
up  with  a  departing  beam  of  light,  whereas  according  to  james  clerk  maxwell's  laws  of
electromagnetism, you can't. as we will discuss in chapter 2, einstein resolved this conflict through
his theory of special relativity, and in so doing completely overturned our understanding of space and
time.  according  to  special  relativity,  no  longer  can  space  and  time  be  thought  of  as  universal
concepts  set  in  stone,  experienced  identi

chemicals in the retina, giving rise to the sensation of sight. moreover (and this is crucial), maxwell's
theory also showed that all electromagnetic waves—visible light among them—are the epitome of the
peripatetic traveler. they never stop. they never slow down. light always travels at light speed.

all  is  well  and  good  until  we  ask,  as  the  sixteen-year-old  einstein  did,  what  happens  if  we
chase after a beam of light, at light speed? intuitive reasoning, rooted in newton's laws of motion,
tells us that we will catch up with the light waves and so they will appear stationary; light will stand
still. but according to maxwell's theory, and all reliable observations, there is simply no such thing
as stationary light: no one has ever held a stationary clump of light in the palm of his or her hand.
hence the problem. luckily, einstein was unaware that many of the world's leading physicists were
struggling  with  this  question  (and  were  heading  down  many  a  spurious  path)  and

orld experienced on everyday scales. to
this end, feynman showed that if you examine the motion of large objects—like baseballs, airplanes,
or planets, all large in comparison with subatomic particles—his rule for assigning numbers to each

path ensures that all paths but one cancel each other out when their contributions are combined. in
effect, only one of the infinity of paths matters as far as the motion of the object is concerned. and this
trajectory is precisely the one emerging from newton's laws of motion. this is why in the everyday
world  it seems  to  us  that  objects—like  a  ball  tossed  in  the  air—follow  a  single,  unique,  and
predictable trajectory from their origin to their destination. but for microscopic objects, feynman's
rule for assigning numbers to paths shows that many different paths can and often do contribute to an
object's motion. in the double-slit experiment, for example, some of these paths pass through different
slits, giving rise to the interference pattern obs

pective situation of the beings that make it up, if moreover it were vast
enough  to  submit  these  data  to  analysis,  would  encompass  in  the  same  formula  the
movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the lightest atoms. for such
an intelligence nothing would be uncertain, and the future, like the past, would be open to
its eyes.8

in  other  words,  if  at  some  instant  you  know  the  positions  and  velocities  of  every  particle  in  the
universe, you can use newton's laws of motion to determine—at least in principle—their positions
and velocities at any other prior or future time. from this perspective, any and all occurrences, from
the  formation  of  the  sun  to  the  crucifixion  of  christ,  to  the  motion  of  your  eyes  across  this  word,
strictly follow from the precise positions and velocities of the particulate ingredients of the universe
a moment after the big bang. this rigid lock-step view of the unfolding of the universe raises all sorts
