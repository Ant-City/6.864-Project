 no matter; let no images
    be hung with caesar's trophies. i'll about
    and drive away the vulgar from the streets;
    so do you too, where you perceive them thick.
    these growing feathers pluck'd from caesar's wing
    will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
    who else would soar above the view of men
    and keep us all in servile fearfulness.              exeunt.

a public place.

flourish. enter caesar; antony, for the course; calpurnia,
portia,
decius, cicero, brutus, cassius, and casca; a great crowd
follows,
among them a soothsayer.

  caesar. calpurnia!
  casca. peace, ho! caesar speaks.
                                                   music ceases.
  caesar. calpurnia!
  calpurnia. here, my lord.
  caesar. stand you directly in antonio's way,
    when he doth run his course. antonio!
  antony. caesar, my lord?
  caesar. forget not in your speed, antonio,

    have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus.

            re-enter caesar and his train.

  brutus. the games are done, and caesar is returning.
  cassius. as they pass by, pluck casca by the sleeve,
    and he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
    what hath proceeded worthy note today.
  brutus. i will do so. but, look you, cassius,
    the angry spot doth glow on caesar's brow,
    and all the rest look like a chidden train:
    calpurnia's cheek is pale, and cicero
    looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
    as we have seen him in the capitol,
    being cross'd in conference by some senators.
  cassius. casca will tell us what the matter is.
  caesar. antonio!
  antony. caesar?
  caesar. let me have men about me that are fat,
    sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
    yond cassius has a lean and hungry look;
    he thinks too much; such men are dangerous.
  antony. fear him not, caesar; he's not dangerous;
    he is a noble

hell among the rogues. and so he fell. when he
came
    to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything
amiss,
    he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.
three or
    four wenches where i stood cried, "alas, good soul!" and
forgave
    him with all their hearts. but there's no heed to be taken of
    them; if caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have
done
    no less.
  brutus. and after that he came, thus sad, away?
  casca. ay.
  cassius. did cicero say anything?
  casca. ay, he spoke greek.
  cassius. to what effect?
  casca. nay, an i tell you that, i'll ne'er look you i' the face
    again; but those that understood him smiled at one another
and
    shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was greek to me.

    could tell you more news too: marullus and flavius, for
pulling
    scarfs off caesar's images, are put to silence. fare you
well.
    there was more foolery yet, if could remember it.
  cassius. will you sup wi

not humor me. i will this night,
    in several hands, in at his windows throw,
    as if they came from several citizens,
    writings, all tending to the great opinion
    that rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely
    caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.
    and after this let caesar seat him sure;
    for we will shake him, or worse days endure.           exit.

enter, from opposite sides, casca, with his sword drawn, and
cicero.

  cicero. good even, casca. brought you caesar home?
    why are you breathless, and why stare you so?
  casca. are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
    shakes like a thing unfirm? o cicero,
    i have seen tempests when the scolding winds
    have rived the knotty oaks, and i have seen
    the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
    to be exalted with the threatening clouds,
    but never till tonight, never till now,
    did i go through a tempest dropping fire.

 either there is a civil strife in heaven,

    incenses them to send destruction.
  cicero. why, saw you anything more wonderful?
  casca. a common slave- you know him well by sight-
    held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
    like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand
    not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.
    besides- i ha' not since put up my sword-
    against the capitol i met a lion,
    who glaz'd upon me and went surly by
    without annoying me. and there were drawn

ore they saw
    men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
    and yesterday the bird of night did sit
    even at noonday upon the marketplace,
    howling and shrieking. when these prodigies
    do so conjointly meet, let not men say
    "these are their reasons; they are natural":
    for i believe they are portentous things
    unto the climate that they point upon.
  cicero. indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
    but men may construe things after their fashion,
    clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
    comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow?
  casca. he doth, for he did bid antonio
    send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
  cicero. good then, casca. this disturbed sky
    is not to walk in.
  casca. farewell, cicero.                          exit cicero.

    such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
    the even virtue of our enterprise,

  cassius. but what of cicero? shall we sound him?
    i think he will stand very strong with us.
  casca. let us not leave him out.
  cinna. no, by no means.

    will purchase us a good opinion,
    and buy men's voices to commend our deeds.
    it shall be said his judgement ruled our hands;
    our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,

ere received letters
    that young octavius and mark antony
    come down upon us with a mighty power,
    bending their expedition toward philippi.
  messala. myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
  brutus. with what addition?
  messala. that by proscription and bills of outlawry
    octavius, antony, and lepidus
    have put to death an hundred senators.
  brutus. there in our letters do not well agree;
    mine speak of seventy senators that died
    by their proscriptions, cicero being one.
  cassius. cicero one!
  messala. cicero is dead,
    and by that order of proscription.
    had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
  brutus. no, messala.
  messala. nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  brutus. nothing, messala.
  messala. that, methinks, is strange.
  brutus. why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
  messala. no, my lord.
  brutus. now, as you are a roman, tell me true.
  messala. then like a roman bear the truth i tell:
