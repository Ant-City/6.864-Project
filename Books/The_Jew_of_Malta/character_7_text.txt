et an injury.
     we jews can fawn like spaniels when we please;
     and when we grin we bite; yet are our looks
     as innocent and harmless as a lamb's.
     i learn'd in florence how to kiss my hand,
     heave up my shoulders when they call me dog,
     and duck as low as any bare-foot friar;
     hoping to see them starve upon a stall,
     or else be gather'd for in our synagogue,
     that, when the offering-basin comes to me,
     even for charity i may spit into't.--
     here comes don lodowick, the governor's son,
     one that i love for his good father's sake.

          enter lodowick.

     lodowick. i hear the wealthy jew walked this way:
     i'll seek him out, and so insinuate,
     that i may have a sight of abigail,
     for don mathias tells me she is fair.

     barabas. now will i shew myself to have more of the serpent than
     the dove; that is, more knave than fool.
          [aside.]

     lodowick. yond' walks the jew:  now for fair abigail.

     barabas. ay, ay, n

sworn to frustrate both their hopes,

          [exit lodowick.]

     katharine. this moor is comeliest, is he not? speak, son.

     mathias. no, this is the better, mother, view this well.

     barabas. seem not to know me here before your mother,
     lest she mistrust the match that is in hand:
     when you have brought her home, come to my house;
     think of me as thy father:  son, farewell.

     mathias. but wherefore talk'd don lodowick with you?

     barabas. tush, man! we talk'd of diamonds, not of abigail.

     katharine. tell me, mathias, is not that the jew?

     barabas. as for the comment on the maccabees,
     i have it, sir, and 'tis at your command.

     mathias. yes, madam, and my talk with him was [77]
     about the borrowing of a book or two.

     katharine. converse not with him; he is cast off from heaven.--
     thou hast thy crowns, fellow.--come, let's away.

     mathias. sirrah jew, remember the book.

     once at jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,
     i strewed powder on the marble stones,
     and therewithal their knees would rankle so,
     that i have laugh'd a-good [81] to see the cripples
     go limping home to christendom on stilts.

     barabas. why, this is something:  make account of me
     as of thy fellow; we are villains both;
     both circumcised; we hate christians both:
     be true and secret; thou shalt want no gold.
     but stand aside; here comes don lodowick.

          enter lodowick. [82]

     lodowick. o, barabas, well met;
     where is the diamond you told me of?

     barabas. i have it for you, sir:  please you walk in with me.--
     what, ho, abigail! open the door, i say!

          enter abigail, with letters.

     abigail. in good time, father; here are letters come
     ]from ormus, and the post stays here within.

     barabas. give me the letters.--daughter, do you hear?

     abigail. why, what ail'st thou?

     ithamore. o, my master!

     abigail. ha!

     ithamore. o mistress, i have the bravest, gravest, secret,
     subtle, bottle-nosed [101] knave to my master, that ever
     gentleman had!

     abigail. say, knave, why rail'st upon my father thus?

     ithamore. o, my master has the bravest policy!

     abigail. wherein?

     ithamore. why, know you not?

     abigail. why, no.

     ithamore.
     know you not of mathia[s'] and don lodowick['s] disaster?

     abigail. no:  what was it?

     ithamore. why, the devil inverted a challenge, my master
     writ it, and i carried it, first to lodowick, and imprimis
     to mathia[s];
     and then they met, [and], as the story says,
     in doleful wise they ended both their days.

     abigail. and was my father furtherer of their deaths?

     ithamore. am i ithamore?

     abigail. yes.

     ithamore.
     so sure did your father write, and i carry the challenge.

     friar barnardine. o, he is gone to see the other nuns.

     abigail. i sent for him; but, seeing you are come,
     be you my ghostly father:  and first know,
     that in this house i liv'd religiously,
     chaste, and devout, much sorrowing for my sins;
     but, ere i came--

     friar barnardine. what then?

     abigail. i did offend high heaven so grievously
     as i am almost desperate for my sins;
     and one offense torments me more than all.
     you knew mathias and don lodowick?

     friar barnardine. yes; what of them?

     abigail. my father did contract me to 'em both;
     first to don lodowick:  him i never lov'd;
     mathias was the man that i held dear,
     and for his sake did i become a nun.

     friar barnardine. so:  say how was their end?

     abigail. both, jealous of my love, envied [122] each other;
     and by my father's practice, [123] which is there
          [gives writing.]
     set down at large, the gallants were both slain.

     barabas. o, speak not of her! then i die with grief.

     friar barnardine. remember that--

     friar jacomo. ay, remember that--

     barabas. i must needs say that i have been a great usurer.

     friar barnardine. thou hast committed--

     barabas. fornication:  but that was in another country;
     and besides, the wench is dead.

     friar barnardine. ay, but, barabas,
     remember mathias and don lodowick.

     barabas. why, what of them?

     friar barnardine.
     i will not say that by a forged challenge they met.

     barabas. she has confess'd, and we are both undone,
     my bosom inmate! [129] but i must dissemble.--
