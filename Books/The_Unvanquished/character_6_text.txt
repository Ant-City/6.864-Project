riposte in tertio

ab snopes left for memphis with the nine mules, ringo and joby and i worked on a new
fence. then ringo went off on his mule and there was just joby and me. once granny
came down and looked at the new section of rails; the pen would be almost two acres
larger now. that was the second day after ringo left. that night, while granny and i were
sitting before the fire, ab snopes came back. he said that he had got only four hundred
and fifty dollars for the nine mules. that is, he took some money out of his po

tobacco when he could get it, willow bark when he couldn't--all the time, and he never
wore a collar, and nobody ever admitted they ever saw him in a uniform, though when
father was away, he would talk a lot now and then about when he was in father's troop
and about what he and father used to do. but when i asked father about it once, father
said, "who? ab snopes?" and then laughed. but it was father that told ab to kind of look
out for granny while he was away; only he told me and ringo to look out for ab, too, that
ab was all right in his way, but he was like a mule: while you had him in the traces, you
better watch him.

he looked at granny again. "when kernel sartoris left here, he told me to look out
for you against general grant and them. what i wonder is, if somebody hadn't better tell
abe lincoln to look out for general grant against miz rosa millard. i bid you one and all
good night."

he went out. granny looked at the fire, the tin can in her hand. but it didn't have
any six thousand dollars in it. it didn't have a thousand dollars in it. ab snopes knew that,
only i don't suppose that it was possible for him to believe it. then she got up; she looked at
me, quiet. she didn't look sick; that wasn't it. "i reckon it's bedtime," she said. she went
beyond the quilt; it came back and hung straight down from the rafter, and i heard the
loose board when she put the can away under the floor, and then i heard the sound the
bed made when she would hold to the post to kneel down. it would make another sound

granny watched him while he came toward the bed. "how many?" she said.


"nineteen head," ringo said. "four with; fifteen without." granny just watched him;
she didn't have to speak at all for the next one. "twelve," ringo said. "out of that oxford

granny said.

have to worry, then." he finished the order and signed "general smith" to it; it looked
exactly like the man who had signed the one colonel dick gave us was named general
smith, except for the number of mules. then granny turned and looked at me. "tell mr.
snopes to be ready at sunup," she said. we went in the wagon, with ab snopes and his
two men following on two of the mules. we went just fast enough so that we would reach
the bivouac at supper-time, because granny and ringo had found out that that was the
best time--that the stock would all be handy, and the men would be too hungry or sleepy
or something to think very quick in case they happened to think, and we would just have
time to get the mules and get out of sight before dark came. then, if they should decide
to chase us, by the time they found us in the dark, th

would get into the wagon and ringo would hang his legs over the tail gate, holding the

"i don't know what you are talking about," granny said. "i have no mules except this

the officer began to laugh; he sat on the horse, laughing. "so that's your real name,
hey? well, well, well. so you have begun to tell the truth at last. come now, tell me where
those mules are, and tell me where the others you have stolen from us are hid."

then ringo hollered. he and ab snopes and the mules had turned off into the
woods on the right side of the road, but when he hollered now he was on the left side.
"heyo the road!" he hollered. "one busted loose! head um off the road!"

whirled his horse, already spurring him, hollering, "two men stay here." maybe they all
thought he meant two others, because there was just a big noise of bushes and trees like a
cyclone was going through them, and then granny and i were sitting in the wagon like

road we could hear them thrashing around, shouting and cursing. it sounded far away
now. "and the team too," granny said.

it was after midnight when we reached home; it was already sunday and when we
reached the church that morning there was the biggest crowd waiting there had ever
been, though ab snopes would not get back with the new mules until tomorrow. so i
believed that somehow they had heard about last night and they knew too, like ringo,
that this was the end and that now the books would have to be balanced and closed. we
were late, because granny made ringo get up at sunup and take the buggy back where

out the names. then they came up one at a time, while ringo read the names off the
book, and the date, and the amount they had received before. each time granny would
make them tell what they intended to do with the money, and now she would make them
tell her how they had spent it, and she would look at the book to see whether they had
lied or not. and the ones that she had loaned the brand-blotted mules that ab snopes
was afraid to try to sell would have to tell her how the mule was getting along and how
much work it had done, and now and then she would take the mule away from one man
or woman and give it to another, tearing up the old receipt and making the man or the
woman sign the new one, telling them on what day to go and get the mule.

it was a bright warm day; we saw the guns and the bits shining a long way down the
road. but this time ringo didn't even move. he just quit drawing and looked up from the
paper and said, "so ab snopes was lying. gre't god, ain't we gonter never get shet of

"look like he got all we ever wrote there," ringo said. the soldiers' horses were all
tied along the fence; they were inside the pen now, and they and joby and ab snopes
had the forty-odd old mules and the nineteen new ones hemmed into the corner. the
mules were still trying to break out, only it didn't look like that. it looked like every one of
them was trying to keep the big burned smear where granny and ringo had blotted the
u. s. brand turned so that the lieutenant would have to look at it.

the original name was grumby or not. but it got them off, because it was just some old
men that captured them; and now women who had lived alone for three years
surrounded by invading armies were afraid to stay in the houses at night, and the negroes
who had lost their white people lived hidden in caves back in the hills like animals.

that's who ab snopes was talking about, with his hat on the floor and his hands
flapping and his hair bent up across the back of his head where he had slept on it. the
band had a thoroughbred stallion and three mares--how ab snopes knew it he didn't say--
that they had stolen; and how he knew they were stolen, he didn't say. but all granny had

talking at ringo, and not hollering now. "catch my mule," he said. "i got the pistol in my

so then it was too late; we just sat there, with the stranger facing us across the fire
with the mare's reins in his little still hand, looking at the three of us from between his hat
and his beard. "ab snopes," he said. "i don't believe i am acquainted with ab snopes. but i

uncle buck rode fast; we could watch his stick rising and falling against the mule's

stick jabbing into the ground like the stick had been with him so long that it felt the rag and
the salt too.

maybe ab snopes was. but uncle buck said not. it was the next morning; we hadn't slept
much because uncle buck wouldn't go to sleep; only we didn't know then that it was his
arm, because he wouldn't even let us talk about taking him back home. and now we tried
again, after we had finished breakfast, but he wouldn't listen, already on his mule with his
left arm tied across his chest and the pistol stuck between the arm and his chest, where he
could get to it quick, saying, "wait. wait," and his eyes hard and sn

s; he hadn't
thought to look any higher yet, and so he did not know that we could see him; he must
have thought that we had just spied him, because all of a sudden he began to jerk and
thrash on the ground, hollering, "help! help! help!"

"what in the tarnation hell!" he said. "well, let's go back to the road. whatever it was

have killed him if they hadn't heard us coming and run away; only his eyes were not

 at ringo and me again, and they were not hollering, like his eyes belonged to
one man and his gaped and yelling mouth belonged to another.

i reckon the name of them would never be grumby now, would it?"

it was like we might have stopped and built a fire and thawed out that moccasin--
just enough for it to find out where it was, but not enough for it to know what to do about
it. only i reckon it was a high compliment to set ab snopes up with a moccasin, even a
little one. i reckon it was bad for him. i reckon he realised that they had thrown him back
to us without mercy, and that if he tried to save himself from us at their expense, they
would come back and kill him. i reckon he decided that the worst thing that could
happen to him would be for us not to do anything to him at all. because he quit jerking his
arms; he even quit lying; for a minute his eyes and his mouth were telling the same thing.

"stand still," uncle buck said. "ain't no three on you. i don't see nobody on you but

one of them children you was just mentioning." then we were both down in the mud; and
then i couldn't see him, and i couldn't seem to find him any more, not even with the
hollering; and then i was fighting three or four for a long time before uncle buck and ringo
held me, and then i could see him again, lying on the ground with his arms over his face.
"get up," uncle buck said.

ab snopes watched uncle buck. "what's them?"
"being born too soon and dying too late," uncle buck said.
he looked at all of us, fast; he didn't move, still talking to uncle buck. "you ain't

to the sapling and ringo had taken off his and uncle buck's and ab snopes' galluses and
knotted them together with the bridle reins from the mules. he just hung there in the rope,
not even flinching when the lash fell, saying, "that's hit. whup me. lay hit on me; you got
me three to one."

he night it began to rain
and we had to burn ringo's stick because uncle buck admitted now that his arm was
getting bad--we all ate supper together, and it was ab snopes that was the most anxious
about uncle buck, saying how it wasn't any hard feelings and that he could see himself
that he had made a mistake in trusting the folks he did, and that all he wanted to do now
was to go back home, because it was only the folks you had known all your life that you
could trust, and when you put faith in a stranger you deserved what you got when you
found that what you had been eating and sleeping with was no better than a passel of
rattlesnakes. but as soon as uncle buc

they left us early the next morning. uncle buck was sick by then; we offered to ride

back home with him, or to let ringo ride back with him, and i would keep ab snopes with
me, but uncle buck wouldn't have it.

you would lose time burying him," uncle buck said. "you boys go on. it ain't going to be
long now. and catch them!" he begun to holler, with his face flushed and his eyes bright,
taking the pistol from around his neck and giving it to me, "catch them! catch them!"

one motion, with louvinia's face hanging over us and still scolding, and joby in the
chimney corner where louvinia had made him get up out of granny's chair. and then
somebody was pulling at me, and i thought i was fighting ab snopes again, and then it
was the rain in father's beard and clothes that i smelled. but uncle buck was still hollering,
and father holding me, and ringo and i held to him, and then it was drusilla kneeling and
holding me and ringo, and we could smell the rain in her hair, too, while she was hollering
at uncle buck to hush. father's hand was hard; i could see his face beyond drusilla and i
