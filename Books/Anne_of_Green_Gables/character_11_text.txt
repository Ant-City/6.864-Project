 breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around
her head. anne promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise,
and plate, candle, and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder
and were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease, the next day,
by marilla, who gathered them up and thanked mercy the house hadn’t been
set on fire.

“whatever is the matter, diana?” cried anne. “has your mother relented
at last?”

“oh, anne, do come quick,” implored diana nervously. “minnie may is
awful sick--she’s got croup. young mary joe says--and father and mother
are away to town and there’s nobody to go for the doctor. minnie may is
awful bad and young mary joe doesn’t know what to do--and oh, anne, i’m
so scared!”

matthew, without a word, reached out for cap and coat, slipped past
diana and away into the darkness of the yard.

“he’s gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to carmody for the doctor,”
 said anne, who was hurrying on hood and jacket. “i know it as

croup. you forget that mrs. hammond had twins three times. when you look
after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience. they
all had croup regularly. just wait till i get the ipecac bottle--you
mayn’t have any at your house. come on now.”

the two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through
lover’s lane and across the crusted field beyond, for the snow was too
deep to go by the shorter wood way. anne, although sincerely sorry
for minnie may, was far from being insensible to the romance of the
situation and to the sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a
kindred spirit.

the night was clear and frosty, all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy
slope; big stars were shining over the silent fields; here and there the
dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the
wind whistling through them. anne thought it was truly delightful to go
skimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom frien

who had been so long estranged.

minnie may, aged three, was really very sick. she lay on the kitchen
sofa feverish and restless, while her hoarse breathing could be heard
all over the house. young mary joe, a buxom, broad-faced french girl
from the creek, whom mrs. barry had engaged to stay with the children
during her absence, was helpless and bewildered, quite incapable of
thinking what to do, or doing it if she thought of it.

anne went to work with skill and promptness.

“minnie may has croup all right; she’s pretty bad, but i’ve seen them
worse. first we must have lots of hot water. i declare, diana, there
isn’t more than a cupful in the kettle! there, i’ve filled it up, and,
mary joe, you may put some wood in the stove. i don’t want to hurt your
feelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if
you’d any imagination. now, i’ll undress minnie may and put her to bed
and you try to find some soft flannel cloths, diana. i’m going to give

r a dose of ipecac first of all.”

minnie may did not take kindly to the ipecac but anne had not brought up
three pairs of twins for nothing. down that ipecac went, not only once,
but many times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls
worked patiently over the suffering minnie may, and young mary joe,
honestly anxious to do all she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated
more water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies.

it was three o’clock when matthew came with a doctor, for he had been
obliged to go all the way to spencervale for one. but the pressing need
for assistance was past. minnie may was much better and was sleeping
soundly.

“i was awfully near giving up in despair,” explained anne. “she got
worse and worse until she was sicker

ed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy
arch of the lover’s lane maples.

“oh, matthew, isn’t it a wonderful morning? the world looks like
something god had just imagined for his own pleasure, doesn’t it? those
trees look as if i could blow them away with a breath--pouf! i’m so glad
i live in a world where there are white frosts, aren’t you? and i’m so
glad mrs. hammond had three pairs of twins after all. if she hadn’t i
mightn’t have known what to do for minnie may. i’m real sorry i was
ever cross with mrs. hammond for having twins. but, oh, matthew, i’m so
sleepy. i can’t go to school. i just know i couldn’t keep my eyes open
and i’d be so stupid. but i hate to stay home, for gil--some of
the others will get head of the class, and it’s so hard to get up
again--although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you
have when you do get up, haven’t you?”

“well now, i guess you’ll manage all right,” said matthew, looking at

er. i can tell by the look of you that you’re just full up
with speeches, but they’ll keep.”

marilla had something to tell anne, but she did not tell it just then
for she knew if she did anne’s consequent excitement would lift her
clear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner.
not until anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did marilla say:

“mrs. barry was here this afternoon, anne. she wanted to see you, but i
wouldn’t wake you up. she says you saved minnie may’s life, and she is
very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine. she
says she knows now you didn’t mean to set diana drunk, and she hopes
you’ll forgive her and be good friends with diana again. you’re to go
over this evening if you like for diana can’t stir outside the door
on account of a bad cold she caught last night. now, anne shirley, for
pity’s sake don’t fly up into the air.”

the warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was anne’s

will be furious. it’s dreadful--it’s really dreadful--but did you ever
know anything so funny, anne?”

“who is your aunt josephine?”

“she’s father’s aunt and she lives in charlottetown. she’s awfully
old--seventy anyhow--and i don’t believe she was _ever_ a little girl. we
were expecting her out for a visit, but not so soon. she’s awfully prim
and proper and she’ll scold dreadfully about this, i know. well, we’ll
have to sleep with minnie may--and you can’t think how she kicks.”

miss josephine barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next
morning. mrs. barry smiled kindly at the two little girls.

“did you have a good time last night? i tried to stay awake until you
came home, for i wanted to tell you aunt josephine had come and that you
would have to go upstairs after all, but i was so tired i fell asleep. i
hope you didn’t disturb your aunt, diana.”

diana preserved a discreet silence, but she and anne exchanged

the queen’s class was organized in due time. gilbert blythe, anne
shirley, ruby gillis, jane andrews, josie pye, charlie sloane, and moody
spurgeon macpherson joined it. diana barry did not, as her parents
did not intend to send her to queen’s. this seemed nothing short of a
calamity to anne. never, since the night on which minnie may had had the
croup, had she and diana been separated in anything. on the evening when
the queen’s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and
anne saw diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through
the birch path and violet vale, it was all the former could do to keep
her seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. a lump
came into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her
uplifted latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. not fo

chapter xxxi. where the brook and river meet


|anne had her “good” summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly. she and diana
fairly lived outdoors, reveling in all the delights that lover’s lane
and the dryad’s bubble and willowmere and victoria island afforded.
marilla offered no objections to anne’s gypsyings. the spencervale
doctor who had come the night minnie may had the croup met anne at the
house of a patient one afternoon early in vacation, looked her over
sharply, screwed up his mouth, shook his head, and sent a message to
marilla cuthbert by another person. it was:

“keep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and don’t
let her read books until she gets more spring into her step.”

this message frightened marilla wholesomely. she read anne’s death
warrant by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed. as a
result,
