clov:
something is taking its course.
(pause.)
hamm:
all right, be off.
(he leans back in his chair, remains motionless. clov does not move, heaves a great groaning sigh. hamm sits up.)
i thought i told you to be off.
clov:
i'm trying.
(he goes to the door, halts.)
ever since i was whelped.
(exit clov.)
hamm:
we're getting on.
(he leans back in his chair, remains motionless. nagg knocks on the lid of the other bin. pause. he knocks harder. the lid lifts and the hands of nell appear, gripping the rim. then her head emerges. lace cap. very white face.)
nell:
what is it, my pet?
(pause.)
time for love?
nagg:
were you asleep?
nell:
oh no!
nagg:
kiss me.
nell:
we can't.
nagg:
try.
(their heads strain towards each other, fail to meet, fall apart again.)
nell:
why this farce, day after day?
(pause.)
nagg:
i've lost me tooth.
nell:
when?
nagg:
i had it yesterday.
nell (elegiac):
ah yesterday.
(they turn painfully towards each other.)
nagg:
can you see me?
nell:
hardly. and

nell:

nagg:

nell:
so much the better, so much the better.
nagg:

(pause.)
our sight has failed.
nell:
yes.
(pause. they turn away from each other.)
nagg:

nell:
yes. and you?
nagg:
yes.
(pause.)
our hearing hasn't failed.
nell:

nagg:
our hearing.
nell:

(pause.)
have you anything else to say to me?
nagg:
do you remember—
nell:
no.
nagg:
when we crashed on our tandem and lost our shanks.
(they laugh heartily.)
nell:
it was in the ardennes.
(they laugh less heartily.)
nagg:
on the road to sedan.
(they laugh still less heartily.)
are you cold?
nell:
yes, perished, and you?
nagg:
(pause.)
i'm freezing.
(pause.)
do you want to go in?
nell:
yes.
nagg:

(nell does not move.)

nell:
i don't know.

nell:
it is important.
(pause.)
nagg:
it was sawdust once.
nell:
once!
nagg:
and now it's sand.
(pause.)
from the shore.
(pause. impatiently.)
now it's sand he fetches from the shore.
nell:
now it's sand.
nagg:
has he changed yours?
nell:
no.
nagg:
nor mine.
(pause.)
i won't have it!
(pause. holding up the biscuit.)

nagg:

(he looks at the biscuit. proudly.)
three quarters. for you. here.
(he proffers the biscuit.)
no?
(pause.)
do you not feel well?
hamm (wearily):
quiet, quiet, you're keeping me awake.
(pause.)
talk softer.
(pause.)
if i could sleep i might make love. i'd go into the woods. my eyes would see... the sky, the earth. i'd run, run, they wouldn't catch me.
(pause.)
nature!
(pause.)
there's something dripping in my head.
(pause.)

rt in my head.
(pause.)
nagg:
do you hear him? a heart in his head!
(he chuckles cautiously.)
nell:
one mustn't laugh at those things, nagg. why must you always laugh at them?
nagg:
not so loud!
nell (without lowering her voice):
nothing is funnier than unhappiness, i grant you that. but—
nagg (shocked):
oh!
nell:
yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. and we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. but it's always the same thing. yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more.
(pause.)
have you anything else to say to me?
nagg:
no.
nell:
are you quite sure?
(pause.)
then i'll leave you.
nagg:
do you not want your biscuit?
(pause.)
i'll keep it for you.
(pause.)
i thought you were going to leave me.

nagg:
could you give me a scratch before you go?
nell:
no.
(pause.)
where?
nagg:
in the back.
nell:
no.
(pause.)
rub yourself against the rim.
nagg:
it's lower down. in the hollow.
nell:
what hollow?
nagg:
the hollow!
(pause.)
could you not?
(pause.)
yesterday you scratched me there.
nell (elegiac):
ah yesterday.
nagg:
could you not?
(pause.)
would you like me to scratch you?
(pause.)
are you crying again?
nell:
i was trying.
(pause.)
hamm:
perhaps it's a little vein.
(pause.)
nagg:
what was that he said?
nell:
perhaps it's a little vein.
nagg:
what does that mean?
(pause.)
that means nothing.
(pause.)
shall i tell you the story of the tailor?
nell:
no.
(pause.)
what for?
nagg:
to cheer you up.
nell:
it's not funny.
nagg:
it always made you laugh.
(pause.)
the first time i thought you'd die.
nell:
it was on lake como.
(pause.)
one april afternoon.
(pause.)
can you believe it?
nagg:
what?
nell:
that we

 once went out rowing on lake como.
(pause.)
one april afternoon.
nagg:
we had got engaged the day before.
nell:
engaged!
nagg:
you were in such fits that we capsized. by rights we should have been drowned.
nell:
it was because i felt happy.
nagg (indignant):
it was not, it was not, it was my story and nothing else. happy! don't you laugh at it still? every time i tell it. happy!
nell:
it was deep, deep. and you could see down to the bottom. so white. so clean.
nagg:
let me tell it again.
(raconteur's voice.)
an englishman, needing a pair of striped trousers in a hurry for the new year festivities, goes to his tailor who takes his measurements.
(tailor's voice.)
"that's the lot, come back in four days, i'll have it ready." good. four days later.
(tailor's voice.)
"so sorry, come back in a week, i've made a mess of the seat." good, that's all right, a neat seat can be very ti

(customer's voice.)
"god damn you to hell, sir, no, it's indecent, there are limits! in six days, do you hear me, six days, god made the world. yes sir, no less sir, the world! and you are not bloody well capable of making me a pair of trousers in three months!"
(tailor's voice, scandalized.)
"but my dear sir, my dear sir, look—
(disdainful gesture, disgustedly)
—at the world—
(pause.)
and look—
(loving gesture, proudly)
—at my trousers!"
(pause. he looks at nell who has remained impassive, her eyes unseeing. he breaks into a high forced laugh, cuts it short, pokes his head towards nell, launches his laugh again.)
hamm:
silence!
(nagg starts, cuts short his laugh.)
nell:
you could see down to the bottom.
hamm (exasperated):
have you not finished? will you never finish?
(with sudden fury.)
will this never finish?
(nagg disappears into his bin, closes the lid behind him. nell does not move. frenziedly.)
my kingdom for a nightman!
(he whistles. enter clov.

clear away this muck! chuck it in the sea!
(clov goes to bins, halts.)
nell:
so white.
hamm:
what? what's she blathering about?
(clov stoops, takes nell's hand, feels her pulse.)
nell (to clov):
desert!
(clov lets go her hand, pushes her back in the bin, closes the lid.)
clov (returning to his place beside the chair):
she has no pulse.
hamm:
what was she drivelling about?
clov:
she told me to go away, into the desert.
hamm:
damn busybody! is that all?
clov:
no.
hamm:
what else?
clov:
i didn't understand.
hamm:
have you bottled her?
clov:
yes.
hamm:
are they both bottled?
clov:
yes.
hamm:

after the audition.
nagg:

hamm:
yes.
nagg:

where was i?
(pause. gloomily.)
it's finished, we're finished.
(pause.)
nearly finished.

there'll be no more speech.

something dripping in my head, ever since the fontanelles.
(stifled hilarity of nagg.)
splash, splash, always on the same spot.

perhaps it's a little vein.

a little artery.

that we might sleep in peace.
(pause.)
i was asleep, as happy as a king, and you woke me up to have me listen to you. it wasn't indispensable, you didn't really need to have me listen to you.
(pause.)
i hope the day will come when you'll really need to have me listen to you, and need to hear my voice, any voice.
(pause.)
yes, i hope i'll live till then, to hear you calling me like when you were a tiny boy, and were frightened, in the dark, and i was your only hope.
(pause. nagg knocks on lid of nell's bin. pause.)
nell!
(pause. he knocks louder. pause. louder.)
nell!

hamm:
our revels now are ended.

the dog's gone.
clov:
he's not a real dog, he can't go.
hamm (groping):
he's not there.
clov:
he's lain down.
hamm:
give him up to me.

i'm afraid it will.

hamm:
i don't know.
(pause.)
i feel rather drained.

the prolonged creative effort.

if i could drag myself down to the sea! i'd make a pillow of sand for my head and the tide would come.

there's no more tide.

(clov goes to bins, raises the lid of nell's, stoops, looks into it. pause.)
clov:
looks like it.
(he closes the lid, straightens up. hamm raises his toque. pause. he puts it on again.)
hamm (with his hand to his toque):
and nagg?
(clov raises lid of nagg's bin, stoops, looks into it. pause.)
clov:
doesn't look like it.
(he closes the lid, straightens up.)

what's he doing?
