Alonso - 
                King
of Naples and father of Ferdinand. Alonso aided Antonio in unseating
Prospero as Duke of Milan twelve years before. As he appears in
the play, however, he is acutely aware of the consequences of all
his actions. He blames his decision to marry his daughter to the
Prince of Tunis on the apparent death of his son. In addition, after
the magical banquet, he regrets his role in the usurping of Prospero.
