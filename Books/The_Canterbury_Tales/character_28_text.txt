and with that sight her beauty hurt him so,
that if that palamon was wounded sore,

 the custom for soldiers to march thrice around the
funeral pile of an emperor or general; "on the left hand" is
added, in reference to the belief that the left hand was
propitious -- the roman augur turning his face southward, and
so placing on his left hand the east, whence good omens came.
with the greeks, however, their augurs facing the north, it was
just the contrary. the confusion, frequent in classical writers, is
complicated here by the fact that chaucer's description of the
funeral of arcite is taken from statius' "thebaid" -- from a
roman's account of a greek solemnity.

90. lyke-wake: watching by the remains of the dead; from
anglo-saxon, "lice," a corpse; german, "leichnam."

pillars.

19. mister folk:  handicraftsmen, or tradesmen, who have
learned "mysteries."

20. the loves "of queen annelida and false arcite" formed the
subject of a short unfinished poem by chaucer, which was
afterwards worked up into the knight's tale.

21. blue was the colour of truth. see note 36 to the squire's
tale.

22. blife: quickly, eagerly; for "blive" or "belive."

23. it will be seen afterwards that philogenet does not relish it,
and pleads for its relaxation.

24. feat: dainty, neat, handsome; the same as "fetis," oftener
used in chaucer; the adverb "featly" is still used, as applied to
dancing, &c.

excellent is thy name."

58. "benedictus": the first word of the song of zacharias
(luke i. 68); "blessed be the lord god of israel"

59. in the knight's tale we have exemplifications of the
custom of gathering and wearing flowers and branches on may
day; where emily, "doing observance to may," goes into the
garden at sunrise and gathers flowers, "party white and red, to
make a sotel garland for her head"; and again, where arcite
rides to the fields "to make him a garland of the greves; were it
of woodbine, or of hawthorn leaves"

[the noble vindication of true love, as an exalting, purifying,
and honour-conferring power, which chaucer has made in "the
court of love," is repeated in "the cuckoo and the
nightingale." at the same time, the close of the poem leads up
to "the assembly of fowls;" for, on the appeal of the
nightingale, the dispute between her and the cuckoo

notes to the cuckoo and the nightingale


1. these two lines occur also in the knight's tale; they
commence the speech of theseus on the love follies of palamon
and arcite, whom the duke has just found fighting in the forest.

2. a stronger reading is "all."

3. "ocy, ocy," is supposed to come from the latin "occidere,"
to kill; or rather the old french, "occire," "occis," denoting the
doom which the nightingale imprecates or supplicates on all
who do offence to love.

4. grede: cry; italian, "grido."

 opinion by the fact that the
prologue recites most of chaucer's principal
works, and glances, besides, at a long array of
other productions, too many to be fully catalogued.
but, on the other hand, it is objected that the
"legend" makes no mention of "the canterbury
tales" as such; while two of those tales -- the
knight's and the second nun's -- are enumerated
by the titles which they bore as separate
compositions, before they were incorporated in the
great collection: "the love of palamon and
arcite," and "the life of saint cecile" (see note 1
to the second nun's tale). tyrwhitt seems perfectly
justified in placing the composition of the poem
immediately before that of chaucer's magnum
opus, and after the marriage of richard ii to his
first queen, anne of bohemia. that event took
place in 1382; and since it is to anne that the poet
refers when he makes alcestis bid him give his
poem to the queen "at eltham or at sheen," the
"legend" could not have been written earlier. the
