connected with the affair. with your permission i will read it to you.”

holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and
closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. dr. mortimer turned the
manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following
curious, old-world narrative:

        “of the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there
        have been many statements, yet as i come in a direct
        line from hugo baskerville, and as i had the story from
        my father, who also had it from his, i have set it down
        with all belief that it occurred even as is here set
        forth.  and i would have you believe, my sons, that the
        same justice which punishes sin may also most graciously
        forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer
        and repentance it may be removed.  learn then from this
        story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to

      the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and
        brothers being from home, as he well knew.  when they had
        brought her to the hall the maiden was placed in an upper
        chamber, while hugo and his friends sat down to a long
        carouse, as was their nightly custom.  now, the poor lass
        upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing
        and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from
        below, for they say that the words used by hugo baskerville,
        when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who
        said them.  at last in the stress of her fear she did that
        which might have daunted the bravest or most active man,
        for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and
        still covers) the south wall she came down from under the
        eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three
        leagues betwixt the hall and her father’s farm.

eds have taken if she were to reach
        her own home.

        “they had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the
        night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to
        him to know if he had seen the hunt.  and the man, as
        the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could
        scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen
        the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  ‘but
        i have seen more than that,’ said he, ‘for hugo baskerville
        passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind
        him such a hound of hell as god forbid should ever be at
        my heels.’  so the drunken squires cursed the shepherd
        and rode onward.  but soon their skins turned cold, for
        there came a galloping across the moor, and the black
        mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing
        bridle and empty saddle.  then the revellers rode close
        together, for a great fear was on them, bu

but it was not the sight
        of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of hugo
        baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon
        the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it
        was that, standing over hugo, and plucking at his throat,
        there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped
        like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal
        eye has rested upon.  and even as they looked the thing
        tore the throat out of hugo baskerville, on which, as it
        turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the
        three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still
        screaming, across the moor.  one, it is said, died that
        very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were
        but broken men for the rest of their days.

        “such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound
        which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever
        since.  if i have set it down it is

        shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of providence,

        third or fourth generation which is threatened in holy

        crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of

        with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their
        sister elizabeth.]”

when dr. mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed
his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at mr. sherlock
holmes. the latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the
fire.

“well?” said he.

“do you not find it interesting?”

“to a collector of fairy tales.”

dr. mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.
