[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] seems to set the precedent for the family's miscommunication, rivalry, and disagreement. the hostility between sister and stella-rondo has its roots in [CHARACTER]'s own troubled relationships. when stella-rondo forbids sister to speak shirley-t.'s name, it echoes [CHARACTER]'s forbidding of anyone to speak of her cousin. furthermore, [CHARACTER] easily perpetuates lies among the family members, even though, at times, she suspects or even knows the truth. for example, she reprimands sister for suggesting that shirley-t. is stella-rondo's biological daughter, but she herself wonders how stella-rondo could possibly prove that shirley-t. is adopted. later, she links shirley-t.'s silence and strange behavior to mr. whitaker's consumption of chemicals, suggesting that she knows that mr. whitaker is, in fact, shirley-t.'s biological father. rather than not understanding the split between reality and fiction, [CHARACTER] merely prefers one version over the other. she would rather believe that stella-rondo is virtuous than believe she is a girl who has had premarital sex. [CHARACTER]'s desire to deny the truth ultimately proves more damaging to the family's relationships than the truth itself would have been.
