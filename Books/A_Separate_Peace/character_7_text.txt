t was a messy break, he went on, but well have him out of it eventually. hell be walking again.walking again!yes. the doctor didnt look at me, and barely changed his tone of voice. sports are finished for him, after an accident like that. of course.but he must be able to, i burst out, if his legs still there, if you arent going to amputate ityou arent, are you?then if it isnt amputated and the bones are still there, then it must come back the way it was, why wouldnt it? of course it will.dr. stanpole hesitated, and i think glanced at me for a moment. sports are finished. as a friend you ought to help him face that and accept it. the sooner he does the better off hell be. if i had the slightest hope that he could do more than walk id be all for trying for everything. there is no such hope. im sorry, as of course everyone is. its a tragedy, but there it is.i grabbed my head, fingers digging into my skin, and the doctor, thinking to be kind, put his hand on my shoulder. at his touch i lost al

heerful and hopeful. he needs that from you. he wanted especially to see you. you were the one person he asked for.that stopped my tears. i brought my hands down and watched the red brick exterior of the infirmary, a cheerful building, coming closer. of course i was the first person he wanted to see. phineas would say nothing behind my back; he would accuse me, face to face.we were walking up the steps of the infirmary everything was very swift, and next i was in a corridor being nudged by dr. stanpole toward a door. hes in there. ill be with you in a minute.the door was slightly ajar, and i pushed it back and stood transfixed on the threshold. phineas lay among pillows and sheets, his left leg, enormous in its white bindings, suspended a little above the bed. a tube led from a glass bottle into his right arm. some channel began to close inside me and i knew i was about to black out.come on in, i heard him say. you look worse than i do. the fact that he could still make a light remark pulle

ore: how phineas used to walk. around devon we had gaits of every description; gangling shuffles from boys who had suddenly grown a foot taller, swinging cowboy lopes from those thinking of how wide their shoulders had become, ambles, waddles, light trippings, gigantic bunyan strides. but phineas had moved in continuous flowing balance, so that he had seemed to drift along with no effort at all, relaxation on the move. he hobbled now among the patches of ice. there was the one certainty that dr. stanpole had givenphineas would walk again. but the thought was there before me that he would never walk like that again.do you have a class? he said as we reached the steps of the building.yes.so do i. lets not go.not go? but whatll we use for an excuse?well say i fainted from exertion on the way from chapel, he looked at me with a phantoms smile, and you had to tend me.this is your first day back, finny. youre no one to cut classes.i know, i know. im going to work. i really am going to work. yo

ne who carried others. i didnt think he knew how to act or even how to feel as the object of help. he went past with his eyes closed and his mouth tense. i knew that normally i would have been one of those carrying the chair, saying something into his ear as we went along. my aid alone had never seemed to him in the category of help. the reason for this occurred to me as the procession moved slowly across the brilliant foyer to the doors; phineas had thought of me as an extension of himself.dr. stanpole stopped near the doors, looking for the light switch. there was an interval of a few seconds when no one was near him. i came up to him and tried to phrase my question but nothing came out, i couldnt find the word to begin. i was being torn irreconcilably between is he and what is when dr. stanpole, without appearing to notice my tangle, said conversationally, its the leg again. broken again. but a much cleaner break i think, much cleaner. a simple fracture. he found the light switch and the fo

yer was plunged into darkness.outside, the doctors car was surrounded by boys while finny was being lifted inside it by phil latham. phil and dr. stanpole then got into the car and drove slowly away, the headlights forming a bright parallel as they receded down the road, and then swinging into another parallel at right angles to the first as they turned into the infirmary driveway. the crowd began to thin rapidly; the faculty had at last heard that something was amiss in the night, and several alarmed and alarming masters materialized in the darkness and ordered the students to their dormitories.mr. ludsbury loomed abruptly out of a. background

. this was the room.the ground was too damp to sit on, so i crouched down and waited. i could hear their blurred voices droning monotonously through the window. if they do nothing worse, theyre going to bore finny to death, i said to myself. my head seemed to be full of bright remarks this evening. it was cold crouching motionless next to the ground. i stood up and jumped several times, not so much to see into the room as to warm up. the only sounds were occasional snorts from the engine of dr. stanpoles car when it turned over with special reluctance, and a thin, lonely whistling the wind sometimes made high in the still-bare trees. these formed the background for the dull hum of talk in finnys room as phil latham, dr. stanpole and the night nurse worked over him.what could they be talking about? the night nurse had always been the biggest windbag in the school. miss windbag, r.n. phil latham, on the other hand, hardly ever spoke. one of the few things he said was give it the old college try

heard that he only lasted there a year. probably he had said to someone to give something the old college try, and that had finished him; that would probably be grounds for expulsion at harvard. there couldnt possibly be such a thing as the old harvard try. could there be the old devon try? the old devon endeavor? the decrepit devon endeavor? that was good, the decrepit devon endeavor. id use that some time in the butt room. that was pretty funny. ill bet i could get a rise out of finny withdr. stanpole was fairly gabby too. what was he always saying. nothing. nothing? well there must be something he was always saying. everybody had something, some word, some phrase that they were always saying. the trouble with dr. stanpole was that his vocabulary was too large. he talked in a huge circle, he probably had a million words in his vocabulary and he had to use them all before he started over again.thats probably the way they were talking in there now. dr. stanpole was working his way as fast as

 time, and phil latham was saying, give er the old college try, finny. phineas of course was answering them only in latin.i nearly laughed out loud at that.gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres finny probably answered that whenever phil latham spoke. phil latham would look rather blank at that.did finny like phil latham? yes, of course he did. but wouldnt it be funny if he suddenly turned to him and said, phil latham, youre a boob. that would be funny in a way. and what about if he said, dr. stanpole, old pal, youre the most long-winded licensed medical man alive. and it would be even funnier if he interrupted that night nurse and said, miss windbag, youre rotten, rotten to the core. i just thought i ought to tell you. it would never occur to finny to say any of these things, but they struck me as so outrageous that i couldnt stop myself from laughing. i put my hand over my mouth; then i tried to stop my mouth with my fist; if i couldnt get control of this laughing they would hear me in the

 against me, it wasnt some kind of hate youve felt all along. it wasnt anything personal.no, i dont know how to show you, how can i show you, finny? tell me how to show you. it was just some ignorance inside me, some crazy thing inside me, something blind, thats all it was.he was nodding his head, his jaw tightening and his eyes closed on the tears. i believe you. its okay because i understand and i believe you. youve already shown me and i believe you.the rest of the day passed quickly. dr. stanpole had told me in the corridor that he was going to set the bone that afternoon. come back around 5 oclock, he had said, when finny should be coming out of the anaesthesia.i left the infirmary and went to my 10:10 class, which was on american history. mr. patch-withers gave us a five-minute written quiz on the necessary and proper clause of the constitution. at 11 oclock i left that building and crossed the center common where a few students were already lounging although it was still a little ea

 me that afternoon were over now. happiness had disappeared along with rubber, silk, and many other staples, to be replaced by the wartime synthetic, high morale, for the duration.at the gym a platoon was undressing in the locker room. the best that could be said for them physically was that they looked wiry in their startling sets of underwear, which were the color of moss.i never talked about phineas and neither did anyone else; he was, however, present in every moment of every day since dr, stanpole had told me. finny had a vitality which could not be quenched so suddenly, even by the marrow of his bone. that was why i couldnt say anything or listen to anything about him, because he endured so forcefully that what i had to say would have seemed crazy to anyone elsei could not use the past tense, for instanceand what they had to say would be incomprehensible to me. during the time i was with him, phineas created an atmosphere in which i continued now to live, a way of sizing up the world wi
