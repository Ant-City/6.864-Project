on a 
summer night and leaned their heads out into the racket of noise and sleepy chirpings. 

i was told patrick died in a dove-cot, caravaggio said. 
her father loved a city of his own invention, whose streets and walls and borders he and his friends had painted. he never 
truly  stepped  out  of  that  world.  she  realizes  everything  she  knew  about  the  real  world  she  learned  on  her  own  or  from 
caravaggio  or,  during  the  time  they  lived  together,  from  her  stepmother,  clara.  clara,  who  had  once  been  an  actress,  the 
articulate one,  who  had articulated fury  when they all left for the  war.  all through the  last  year in italy she has carried the 
letters from clara. letters she knows were written on a pink rock on an island in georgian bay, written with the wind coming 
over the  water and curling the paper of her notebook before she finally tore the pages  out and put them in an envelope for 
hana. she carried them in her suitcase, each containing a fl

ake of pink rock and that wind. but she has never answered them. 
she has missed clara with a woe but is unable to write to her, now, after all that has happened to her. she cannot bear to talk of 
or even acknowledge the death of patrick. 

and now, on this continent, the  war having travelled elsewhere, the  nunneries and churches that  were turned briefly into 
hospitals are solitary, cut off in the hills of tuscany and umbria. they hold the remnants of war societies, small moraines left 
by a vast glacier. all around them now is the holy forest.

wing he folds over 
himself during the night. it is his world. she feels displaced out of canada during these nights. he asks her why she cannot 
sleep. she lies there irritated at his self-sufficiency, his ability to turn so easily away from the world. she wants a tin roof for 
the rain, two poplar trees to shiver outside her window, a noise she can sleep against, sleeping trees and sleeping roofs that she 
grew up with in the east end of toronto and then for a couple of years with patrick and clara along the skootamatta river and 
later georgian bay. she has not found a sleeping tree, even in the density of this garden. 

“kiss  me.  it’s  your  mouth  i’m  most  purely  in  love  with.  your  teeth.”  and  later,  when  his  head  has  fallen  to  one  side, 
towards the air by the tent’s opening, she has whispered aloud, heard only by herself, “perhaps we should ask caravaggio. my 
father told me once that caravaggio was a man always in love. not just in love but always sink

through it. 

he turned from that.  he knew the trick of quick sleep against this one who had her own rivers and was lost from them. 
yes, caravaggio would explain to her how she could sink into love. even how to sink into cautious love. “i want to take you 
to the skootamatta river, kip,” she said. “i want to show you smoke lake. the woman my father loved lives out on the lakes, 
slips into canoes more easily than into a car. i miss thunder that blinks out electricity. i want you to meet clara of the canoes, 
the last one in my family. there are no others now. my father forsook her for a war.”

beating heart, the way he will listen to a clock on a mine. two a.m. everyone is asleep but her.

where  people  listened  to  concerts.  but  what  he  was  really  interested  in  were  the  clues  to  hana’s  nature,  though  she  was 
evasive, veering caravaggio away from stories that involved some moment of her life. she wanted kip to know her only in the 
present, a person perhaps more flawed or more compassionate or harder or more obsessed than the girl or young woman she 
 

 
had  been  then.  in  her  life  there  was  her  mother  alice  her  father  patrick  her  stepmother  clara  and  caravaggio.  she  had 
already admitted these names to kip as if they were her credentials, her dowry. they were faultless and needed no discussion. 
she used them like authorities in a book she could refer to on the right way to boil an egg, or the correct way to slip garlic into 
a lamb. they were not to be questioned.

and now—because he was quite drunk—caravaggio told the story of hana’s singing the “marseillaise,” which he had told 
her before. “yes, i have heard th

. he skirted urbino where the germans had burned all the field horses of the enemy. they had fought here in this region 
for a month; now he slid through in minutes, recognizing only the black madonna shrines. the war had made all the cities and 
towns similar. 

he came down towards the coast. into gabicce mare, where he had seen the virgin emerge from the sea. he slept on the hill, 

overlooking cliff and water, near where the statue had been taken. that was the end of his first day. 

 
dear clara—dear maman, 
maman is a french word, clara, a circular word, suggesting cuddles, a personal word that can be even shouted in public. 
something as comforting and as eternal as a barge. though you, in spirit, i know are still a canoe. can swerve one around and 
enter a creek in seconds. still independent. still private. not a barge responsible for all around you. this is my first letter in 
years, clara, and i am not used to the formality of them. i have spent the last few months living with t

water, he and the bike sideways, his arms flung back above his head. the cape released itself away 
from him, from whatever was machine and mortal, part of the element of air. 

the motorbike and the soldier stilled in midair, then pivoted down into the water, the metal body between his legs as they 
slammed into it, jarring a white path through it, disappearing, the rain too entering the river. “he will toss thee like a ball into a 
large country.” 

 
how did patrick end up in a dove-cot, clara? his unit had left him, burned and wounded. so burned the buttons of his shirt 

were part of his skin, part of his dear chest. that i kissed 

and you kissed. and how was my father burned? he who could swerve like an eel, or like your canoe, as if charmed, from 
the real world. in his sweet and complicated innocence. he was the most unverbal of men, and i am always surprised women 
liked  him.  we  tend  to  like  a  verbal  man  around  us.  we  are  the  rationalists,  the  wise,  and  he  w

he was a burned man and i was a nurse and i could have nursed him. do you understand the sadness of geography? i could 
have saved him or at least been with him till the end. i know a lot about burning. how long was he alone with doves and rats? 
with the last stages of blood and life in him? doves over him. the flutter when they thrashed around him. unable to sleep in 
the darkness. he always hated darkness. and he was alone, without lover or kin. 

i am sick of europe, clara. 1 want to come home. to your small cabin and pink rock in georgian bay. i will take a bus up to 
parry sound. and from the mainland send a message over the shortwave radio out towards the pancakes. and wait for you,
