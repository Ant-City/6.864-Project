her head closer down, â€˜and iâ€™m nearly sure they canâ€™t see me. i feel
somehow as if i were invisible--â€™

here something began squeaking on the table behind alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the white pawns roll over and
begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would
happen next.

â€˜it is the voice of my child!â€™ the white queen cried out as she rushed
past the king, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders.
â€˜my precious lily! my imperial kitten!â€™ and she began scrambling wildly
up the side of the fender.

â€˜imperial fiddlestick!â€™ said the king, rubbing his nose, which had been
hurt by the fall. he had a right to be a little annoyed with the queen,
for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.

alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little lily was
nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the queen and
set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.

gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had
quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing
but hug the little lily in silence. as soon as she had recovered her
breath a little, she called out to the white king, who was sitting
sulkily among the ashes, â€˜mind the volcano!â€™

â€˜what volcano?â€™ said the king, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if
he thought that was the most likely place to find one.

â€˜blew--me--up,â€™ panted the queen, who was still a little out of breath.
â€˜mind you come up--the regular way--donâ€™t get blown up!â€™

alice watched the white king as he slowly struggled up from bar

shall do it this time--â€™ when the path gave a sudden twist and shook
itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door.

â€˜oh, itâ€™s too bad!â€™ she cried. â€˜i never saw such a house for getting in
the way! never!â€™

however, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be
done but start again. this time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a
border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.

â€˜o tiger-lily,â€™ said alice, addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind, â€˜i wish you could talk!â€™

â€˜we can talk,â€™ said the tiger-lily: â€˜when thereâ€™s anybody worth talking
to.â€™

alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away. at length, as the tiger-lily only went
on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice--almost in a whisper.
â€˜and can all the flowers talk?â€™

â€˜as well as you can,â€™ said the tiger

-lily. â€˜and a great deal louder.â€™

â€˜it isnâ€™t manners for us to begin, you know,â€™ said the rose, â€˜and i
really was wondering when youâ€™d speak! said i to myself, â€œher face has
got some sense in it, though itâ€™s not a clever one!â€ still, youâ€™re the
right colour, and that goes a long way.â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t care about the colour,â€™ the tiger-lily remarked. â€˜if only her
petals curled up a little more, sheâ€™d be all right.â€™

alice didnâ€™t like being criticised, so she began asking questions.
â€˜arenâ€™t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody
to take care of you?â€™

â€˜thereâ€™s the tree in the middle,â€™ said the rose: â€˜what else is it good
for?â€™

â€˜but what could it do, if any danger came?â€™ alice asked.

â€˜it says â€œbough-wough!â€â€™ cried a daisy: â€˜thatâ€™s why its branches are
called boughs!â

â€˜didnâ€™t you know that?â€™ cried another daisy, and here they all began
shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices. â€˜silence, every one of you!â€™ cried the tiger-lily, waving itself
passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. â€˜they
know i canâ€™t get at them!â€™ it panted, bending its quivering head towards
alice, â€˜or they wouldnâ€™t dare to do it!â€™

â€˜never mind!â€™ alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the
daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, â€˜if you donâ€™t
hold your tongues, iâ€™ll pick you!â€™

there was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned
white.

â€˜thatâ€™s right!â€™ s

aid the tiger-lily. â€˜the daisies are worst of all. when
one speaks, they all begin together, and itâ€™s enough to make one wither
to hear the way they go on!â€™

â€˜how is it you can all talk so nicely?â€™ alice said, hoping to get it
into a better temper by a compliment. â€˜iâ€™ve been in many gardens before,
but none of the flowers could talk.â€™

â€˜put your hand down, and feel the ground,â€™ said the tiger-lily. â€˜then
youâ€™ll know why.â€™

alice did so. â€˜itâ€™s very hard,â€™ she said, â€˜but i donâ€™t see what that has
to do with it.â€™

â€˜in most gardens,â€™ the tiger-lily said, â€˜they make the beds too soft--so
that the flowers are always asleep.â€™

this sounded a very good reason, and alice was quite pleased to know it.
â€˜i never thought of that before!â€™ she said.

â€˜itâ€™s my opinion that you never think at all,â€™ the rose said in a rather
severe tone.

â€˜i never saw anybody that loo

ked stupider,â€™ a violet said, so suddenly,
that alice quite jumped; for it hadnâ€™t spoken before.

â€˜hold your tongue!â€™ cried the tiger-lily. â€˜as if you ever saw anybody!
you keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know
no more whatâ€™s going on in the world, than if you were a bud!â€™

â€˜are there any more people in the garden besides me?â€™ alice said, not
choosing to notice the roseâ€™s last remark.

â€˜thereâ€™s one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,â€™
said the rose. â€˜i wonder how you do it--â€™ (â€˜youâ€™re always wondering,â€™
said the tiger-lily), â€˜but sheâ€™s more bushy t

han you are.â€™

â€˜is she like me?â€™ alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind,
â€˜thereâ€™s another little girl in the garden, somewhere!â€™

â€˜well, she has the same awkward shape as you,â€™ the rose said, â€˜but sheâ€™s
redder--and her petals are shorter, i think.â€™

â€˜her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,â€™ the tiger-lily
interrupted: â€˜not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.â€™

â€˜but thatâ€™s not your fault,â€™ the rose added kindly: â€˜youâ€™re beginning
to fade, you know--and then one canâ€™t help oneâ€™s petals getting a little
untidy.â€™

alice didnâ€™t like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked
â€˜does she ever come out here?â€™

â€˜i daresay youâ€™ll see her soon,â€™ said the rose. â€˜sheâ€™s one of the thorny
kind.â€™

â€˜where does she wear the thorns?â€™ alice asked with some curiosit

excitement as she went on. â€˜itâ€™s a great huge game of chess thatâ€™s
being played--all over the world--if this is the world at all, you know.
oh, what fun it is! how i wish i was one of them! i wouldnâ€™t mind being
a pawn, if only i might join--though of course i should like to be a
queen, best.â€™

she glanced rather shyly at the real queen as she said this, but her
companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, â€˜thatâ€™s easily managed. you
can be the white queenâ€™s pawn, if you like, as lilyâ€™s too young to
play; and youâ€™re in the second square to begin with: when you get to
the eighth square youâ€™ll be a queen--â€™ just at this moment, somehow or
other, they began to run.

alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it
was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand
in hand, and the queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep
up with her: and still the queen kept crying â€˜faster! faster!â€™ but alice
felt she could
