[CHARACTER] - 
      [CHARACTER] is volpone's parasite, a combination of his slave, his servant, his lackey, and his surrogate child. though initially (and for most of the play) he behaves in a servile manner towards volpone, [CHARACTER] conceals a growing independence he gains as a result of the incredible resourcefulness he shows in aiding and abetting volpone's confidence game. [CHARACTER]'s growing confidence, and awareness that the others in the play are just as much "parasites" as he--in that they too would rather live off the wealth of others than do honest work--eventually bring him into conflict with volpone, a conflict that destroys them both.
