[CHARACTER] - 
                 the
novel's author and a minor character. vonnegut himself was a prisoner
of war during the firebombing of dresden, and he periodically inserts himself
in the narrative, as when he becomes the incontinent soldier in
the latrine in the german prison camp. this authorial presence reappears
throughout the novel, particularly in the refrain "so it goes" that follows
each mention of death. vonnegut's commentary as a character and
an author enables a more factual interpretation of a story that
seems almost preternaturally fictional and adds support to the idea that
such fantastical elements may be the reality of a traumatized mind.
