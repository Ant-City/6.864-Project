    discourse, i prithee, on this turret's top.
  talbot. the earl of bedford had a prisoner
    call'd the brave lord ponton de santrailles;
    for him was i exchang'd and ransomed.
    but with a baser man of arms by far
    once, in contempt, they would have barter'd me;
    which i disdaining sc

    and if i did but stir out of my bed,
    ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

                enter the boy with a linstock

  salisbury. i grieve to hear what torments you endur'd;
    but we will be reveng'd sufficiently.
    now it is supper-time in orleans:
    here, through this grate, i count each one
    and view the frenchmen how they fortify.
    let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.
    sir thomas gargrave and sir william glansdale,
    let me have your express opinions
    where is best place to make our batt'ry next.
  gargrave. i think at the north gate; for there stand lords.
  glansdale. and i here, at the bulwark of the bridge.
  talbot. for aught i see, this city must be famish'd,
    or with light skirmishes enfeebled.

  gargrave. o lord, have mercy on me, woeful man!
  talbot. what chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
    speak, salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak.
    how far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
    one of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
    accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
    that hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!
    in thirteen battles salisbury o'ercame;
    henry the fifth he first train'd to the wars;
    whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up,

    yet liv'st thou, salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,
    one eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;
    the sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
    heaven, be thou gracious to none alive
    if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
    bear hence his body; i will help to bury it.
    sir thomas gargrave, hast thou any life?
    speak unto talbot; nay, look up to him.
    salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
    thou shalt not die whiles
    he beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
    as who should say 'when i am dead and gone,
    remember to avenge me on the french.'
    plantagenet, i will; and like thee, nero,
    play on the lute, beholding the towns burn.
    wretched shall france be only in my name.
