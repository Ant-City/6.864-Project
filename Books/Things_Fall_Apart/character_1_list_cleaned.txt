                okonkwo's
oldest son, whom okonkwo believes is weak and lazy. okonkwo continually
beats [CHARACTER], hoping to correct the faults that he perceives in him.
influenced by ikemefuna, [CHARACTER] begins to exhibit more masculine
behavior, which pleases okonkwo. however, he maintains doubts about
some of the laws and rules of his tribe and eventually converts
to christianity, an act that okonkwo criticizes as "effeminate."
okonkwo believes that [CHARACTER] is afflicted with the same weaknesses
that his father, unoka, possessed in abundance.
