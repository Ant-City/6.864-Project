[CHARACTER] - 
      
        roman tribune of the people. brother of titus andronicus. unlike the other andronici, he never participates in the war. where everyone else has had a hand in at least one murder or crime, he remains conspicuously removed from the bloodshed. every time he speaks, he is the sound of reason and calmness, standing in stark contrast to the ravenous and crazed speeches of the other characters.
