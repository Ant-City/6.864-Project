cyrano. holier e ! 

ragueneau. but i intend to leave no 
later than to-morrow. yes, i am indig-

pin, and i saw that he has appropriated a 
scene of yours. 

le bret. a whole scene ? 

ragueneau. yes, monsieur. the one 
in which occurs the famous " what the 
devil was he 4oing in . . ."

cyrano de bergerac. 

le bret. moliere has taken that from

cross-road in fear of mocking eyes. to 
you i owe having" had, at least, among 
the gentle and fair, a friend. thanks to 
you there has papsed across my life the 
rustle of a woman's gown.

moonlight peering through the branches).
