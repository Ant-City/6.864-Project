an honored burial to one, to the other

what you have done is a disgrace to me, 

to those of your own blood, and to your country. 

you have come to a land always upholding justice, 

sanctioning nothing without recourse to law; 880 

and yet you have slighted our authority, 

burst in upon us, seized and carried away 

whoever took your fancy, as if you thought 

that there were no men left within my city, 

or only slaves, and i was a mere nothing.

oedipus at colonus 

you bring dishonor upon an innocent city, 

your own thebes; and although you have lived long, 

you are still stupid. i have told you once, 

and i tell you again now: bring his daughters back 

without delay, unless you wish to live 900 

among us as an alien, a forced guest. 

these are not merely words. my heart is in them. 

chorus: 

you hear that, stranger? that is our judgment of you; 
your land is noble and your deeds are base. 
creon: 

theseus, how could i ever think that athens 

lacked manliness or wisdom? i supposed 

her citizens would never be so eager 

to serve my kinsmen as to shelter them 

against my will. this country, i was certain, 

would show no hospitality to a man 910 

steeped in pollution: the slayer of his father, 

and partner of an unholy marriage-bed, 

mother with son. knowing the hill of ares 

makes wise decisions and does not allow 

such vagabonds to stay here, i felt free 

to seize this prize.

 yet i would not have touched him 

if he had not called down a bitter curse 

on me and on my race, an injury 

which justified, i thought, my giving back 

evil for evil. anger does not grow old; 920 

only the dead escape the sting of it. 

you can, of course, act any way you choose, 

for i am helpless, though my cause is just. 

yet i will do my best, old as i am, 

to follow the example that you set me. 

oedipus: 

what bare-faced insolence, creon! whose old age 

do you think has been dishonored, yours or mine? 

you have poured out a stream of accusations: 

murder and incest, all the disastrous things 

that my hard fate has forced me to endure. 930 

so the gods willed it, nursing their long displeasure, 

doubtless, against my house. for i myself 

cannot be charged with any deliberate crime 

for which, as retribution, i was driven 

to sin against my parents and myself. 

tell me. if through some oracle my father 

was destined to

you would, i am sure, repay him blow for blow

oedipus at colonu3 
chorus: 

sir, oedipus, our guest, has been accurst; 

yet he is innocent and deserves our help. 
theseus: 

we have talked enough. those who have done this violence 

hurry away, and we, their victims, stand here. 
creon: 

what orders have you for a helpless man? 
theseus: 

these. lead us after them. take me along. 

if you have kept his daughters in this country, 990 

show me where i can find them. but if your men 

are carrying off their prize, we need not trouble. 

others will catch them. they will never thank 

their gods for their escape from athens. come! 

lead on! the captor is made captive; fortune 

has snared the hunter; no ill-gotten gains 

can be kept long. but do not expect your helper;

 daring and insolent though you are, i know 

you did not undertake this singlehanded. 

no, you had some accomplice whom you trusted 1000 

when you came here. he must be hunted down. 

athens must be the master and not he. 

can you grasp any part of what i have said? 

or do you think you can ignore my words, 

as you ignored those warnings that you heard 

when you first put your scheming into practice? 
creon: 

whatever you say here i shall not object to. 

when i am home, i shall know how to act. 
theseus: 

threaten me if you want, but lead the way. 

now, oedipus, you can stay here in peace 1010 

with my assurance that, unless i die, 

i will restore your children to your hands. 

oedipus: 

you have acted nobly, theseus. may the gods 
reward you for the kindness you have shown me.
