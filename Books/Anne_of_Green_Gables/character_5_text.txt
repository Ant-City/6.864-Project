chapter i. mrs. rachel lynde is surprised


|mrs. rachel lynde lived just where the avonlea main road dipped down
into a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies’ eardrops and
traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the
old cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook
in its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool
and cascade; but by the time it reached lynde’s hollow it was a quiet,
well-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past mrs.

hout due regard for decency and decorum; it
probably was conscious that mrs. rachel was sitting at her window,
keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children
up, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never
rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.

there are plenty of people in avonlea and out of it, who can attend
closely to their neighbor’s business by dint of neglecting their own;
but mrs. rachel lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage
their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. she was a
notable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she “ran” the
sewing circle, helped run the sunday-school, and was the strongest prop
of the church aid society and foreign missions auxiliary. yet with all
this mrs. rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen
window, knitting “cotton warp” quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them,
as avonlea h

 mile up the road from lynde’s hollow. to be sure, the
long lane made it a good deal further. matthew cuthbert’s father, as
shy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly
could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods
when he founded his homestead. green gables was built at the furthest
edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day, barely visible
from the main road along which all the other avonlea houses were so
sociably situated. mrs. rachel lynde did not call living in such a place
_living_ at all.

“it’s just _staying_, that’s what,” she said as she stepped along the
deep-rutted, grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes. “it’s no wonder
matthew and marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by
themselves. trees aren’t much company, though dear knows if they were
there’d be enough of them. i’d ruther look at people. to be sure, they
seem contented enough; but then, i suppose, they’re used to it. a body

anybody’s feelings, even a little bookcase girl’s or a little echo
girl’s. i must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every
day.”

anne blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry
blossoms and then, with her chin in her hands, drifted luxuriously out
on a sea of daydreams.




chapter ix. mrs. rachel lynde is properly horrified


|anne had been a fortnight at green gables before mrs. lynde arrived to
inspect her. mrs. rachel, to do her justice, was not to blame for this.
a severe and unseasonable attack of grippe had confined that good lady
to her house ever since the occasion of her last visit to green gables.
mrs. rachel was not often sick and had a well-defined contempt for
people who were; but grippe, she asserted, was like no other illness on
earth and could only be interpreted as one of the

e unexpected presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside
the door. she certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short
tight wincey dress she had worn from the asylum, below which her thin
legs seemed ungracefully long. her freckles were more numerous and
obtrusive than ever; the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into
over-brilliant disorder; it had never looked redder than at that moment.

“well, they didn’t pick you for your looks, that’s sure and certain,”
 was mrs. rachel lynde’s emphatic comment. mrs. rachel was one of those
delightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking their
mind without fear or favor. “she’s terrible skinny and homely, marilla.
come here, child, and let me have a look at you. lawful heart, did
any one ever see such freckles? and hair as red as carrots! come here,
child, i say.”

anne “came there,” but not exactly as mrs. rachel expected. with one
bound she crossed the kitchen floor and stood before mrs. rachel, her
face

 rachel’s dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with
amusement and she felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh.




chapter x. anne’s apology


|marilla said nothing to matthew about the affair that evening; but when
anne proved still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be
made to account for her absence from the breakfast table. marilla told
matthew the whole story, taking pains to impress him with a due sense of
the enormity of anne’s behavior.

“it’s a good thing rachel lynde got a calling down; she’s a meddlesome
old gossip,” was matthew’s consolatory rejoinder.

“matthew cuthbert, i’m astonished at you. you know that anne’s behavior
was dreadful, and yet you take her part! i suppose you’ll be saying next
thing that she oughtn’t to be punished at all!”

“well now--no--not exactly,” said matthew uneasily. “i reckon she
ought to be punished a little. but don’t be too hard on her, marilla.
recollect she hasn’t ever had anyone to teach her r

but it had.

it was a january the premier came, to address his loyal supporters and
such of his nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass
meeting held in charlottetown. most of the avonlea people were on
premier’s side of politics; hence on the night of the meeting nearly
all the men and a goodly proportion of the women had gone to town thirty
miles away. mrs. rachel lynde had gone too. mrs. rachel lynde was a
red-hot politician and couldn’t have believed that the political rally
could be carried through without her, although she was on the opposite
side of politics. so she went to town and took her husband--thomas would
be useful in looking after the horse--and marilla cuthbert with her.
marilla had a sneaking interest in politics herself, and as she thought
it might be her only chance to see a real live premier, she promptly
took it, leaving anne and matthew

anne accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it
was well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and
descended to the kitchen where marilla, who had arrived home in the
meantime, was sitting knitting.

“oh, did you see the premier?” exclaimed anne at once. “what did he look
like marilla?”

“well, he never got to be premier on account of his looks,” said
marilla. “such a nose as that man had! but he can speak. i was proud of
being a conservative. rachel lynde, of course, being a liberal, had no
use for him. your dinner is in the oven, anne, and you can get yourself
some blue plum preserve out of the pantry. i guess you’re hungry.
matthew has been telling me about last night. i must say it was
fortunate you knew what to do. i wouldn’t have had any idea myself, for
i never saw a case of croup. there now, never mind talking till you’ve
had your dinner. i can tell by the look of you that you’re just full up
with speeches, but they’ll keep.”

oolery, and never
thinking once about the time or her duties. she’s just got to be pulled
up short and sudden on this sort of thing. i don’t care if mrs. allan
does say she’s the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew. she may
be bright and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and there’s
never any knowing what shape it’ll break out in next. just as soon as
she grows out of one freak she takes up with another. but there! here i
am saying the very thing i was so riled with rachel lynde for saying at
the aid today. i was real glad when mrs. allan spoke up for anne, for
if she hadn’t i know i’d have said something too sharp to rachel before
everybody. anne’s got plenty of faults, goodness knows, and far be it
from me to deny it. but i’m bringing her up and not rachel lynde, who’d
pick faults in the angel gabriel himself if he lived in avonlea. just
the same, anne has no business to leave the house like this when i told
her she was to stay home this afternoon and look
