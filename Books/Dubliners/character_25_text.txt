ley and what was the latest. he replied that he had spent the day with corley. his friends talked very little. they looked vacantly after some figures in the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark. one said that he had seen mac an hour before in westmoreland street. at this lenehan said that he had been with mac the night before in eganâ€™s. the young man who had seen mac in westmoreland street asked was it true that mac had won a bit over a billiard match. lenehan did not know: he said that holohan had stood them drinks in eganâ€™s.
he left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up georgeâ€™s street. he turned to the left at the city markets and walked on into grafton street. the crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way up the street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another good-night. he went as far as the clock of the college of surgeons: it was on the stroke of ten. he set off briskly along the northern side of the green hurrying for fear corley should retu

mr holohan, assistant secretary of the eire abu society, had been walking up and down dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of concerts. he had a game leg and for this his friends called him hoppy holohan. he walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was mrs kearney who arranged everything.
miss devlin had become mrs kearney out of spite. she had been educa

riends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said good-bye to one another in irish. soon the name of miss kathleen kearney began to be heard often on peopleâ€™s lips. people said that she was very clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a believer in the language movement. mrs kearney was well content at this. therefore she was not surprised when one day mr holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his society was going to give in the antient concert rooms. she brought him into the drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel. she entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up by which kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four

 grand concerts.
as mr holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme, mrs kearney helped him. she had tact. she knew what artistes should go into capitals and what artistes should go into small type. she knew that the first tenor would not like to come on after mr meadeâ€™s comic turn. to keep the audience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites. mr holohan called to see her every day to have her advice on some point. she was invariably friendly and advisingâ€”homely, in fact. she pushed the decanter towards him, saying:
â€œnow, help yourself, mr holohan!â€
and while he was helping himself she said:
â€œdonâ€™t be afraid! donâ€™t be afraid of it!â€
everything went on smoothly. mrs kearney bought some lovely blush-pink charmeuse in brown thomasâ€™s to let into the front of kathleenâ€™s dress. it cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a

in the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the secretary of the society, mr fitzpatrick. she smiled and shook his hand. he was a little man, with a white vacant face. she noticed that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that his accent was flat. he held a programme in his hand and, while he was talking to her, he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp. he seemed to bear disappointments lightly. mr holohan came into the dressing-room every few minutes with reports from the box-office. the artistes talked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music. when it was nearly half-past eight, the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be entertained. mr fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and said:
â€œwell now, ladies and gentlemen. i suppose weâ€™d better open the ball.â€
mrs kearney rewarded his very flat final s

yllable with a quick stare of contempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:
â€œare you ready, dear?â€
when she had an opportunity, she called mr holohan aside and asked him to tell her what it meant. mr holohan did not know what it meant. he said that the committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concerts: four was too many.
â€œand the artistes!â€ said mrs kearney. â€œof course they are doing their best, but really they are not good.â€
mr holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the committee, he said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for saturday night. mrs kearney said nothing, but, as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert. there was something she didnâ€™t like in the look of things and mr fitzpatrickâ€™s vacant smile ir

 mr fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was quite unconscious that mrs kearney was taking angry note of his conduct. he stood at the edge of the screen, from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. in the course of the evening, mrs kearney learned that the friday concert was to be abandoned and that the committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on saturday night. when she heard this, she sought out mr holohan. she buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. yes, it was true.
â€œbut, of course, that doesnâ€™t alter the contract,â€ she said. â€œthe contract was for four concerts.â€
mr holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to mr fitzpatrick. mrs kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. she called mr fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concerts and that, of course,

ber of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. she was glad that he had suggested coming with her. she thought her plans over.
the night of the grand concert came. mrs kearney, with her husband and daughter, arrived at the antient concert rooms three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin. by ill luck it was a rainy evening. mrs kearney placed her daughterâ€™s clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for mr holohan or mr fitzpatrick. she could find neither. she asked the stewards was any member of the committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named miss beirne to whom mrs kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries. miss beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything. mrs kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered:
â€œno, thank you!â€

was evidently about kathleen for they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her nationalist friends, miss healy, the contralto. an unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room. the women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body. someone said that she was madam glynn, the soprano.
â€œi wonder where did they dig her up,â€ said kathleen to miss healy. â€œiâ€™m sure i never heard of her.â€
miss healy had to smile. mr holohan limped into the dressing-room at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown woman. mr holohan said that she was madam glynn from london. madam glynn took her stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled gaze. the shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her collar-bone. the noise of the hall became more audible. the first tenor and th

e baritone arrived together. they were both well dressed, stout and complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company.
mrs kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably. she wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove to be polite, her eyes followed mr holohan in his limping and devious courses. as soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him.
â€œmr holohan, i want to speak to you for a moment,â€ she said.
they went down to a discreet part of the corridor. mrs kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. mr holohan said that mr fitzpatrick had charge of that. mrs kearney said that she didnâ€™t know anything about mr fitzpatrick. her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. mr holohan said that it wasnâ€™t his business.
â€œwhy isnâ€™t it your business?â€ asked mrs kearney. â€œdidnâ€™t you yourse

â€œyouâ€™d better speak to mr fitzpatrick,â€ said mr holohan distantly.
â€œi donâ€™t know anything about mr fitzpatrick,â€ repeated mrs kearney. â€œi have my contract, and i intend to see that it is carried out.â€
when she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused. the room was lively. two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with miss healy and the baritone. they were the freeman man and mr oâ€™madden burke. the freeman man had come in to say that he could not wait for the conce

d enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account. the warmth, fragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses. he was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him, that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute. when he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully.
â€œoâ€™madden burke will write the notice,â€ he explained to mr holohan, â€œand iâ€™ll see it in.â€
â€œthank you very much, mr hendrick,â€ said mr holohan, â€œyouâ€™ll see it in, i know. now, wonâ€™t you have a little something before you go?â€
â€œi donâ€™t mind,â€ said mr hendrick.
the two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen. one of these gentlemen was mr oâ€™madden burke, who had found out the room by instinct. he was a suave, elderly man

who balanced his imposing body, when at rest, upon a large silk umbrella. his magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his finances. he was widely respected.
while mr holohan was entertaining the freeman man mrs kearney was speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower her voice. the conversation of the others in the dressing-room had become strained. mr bell, the first item, stood ready with his music but the accompanist made no sign. evidently something was wrong. mr kearney looked straight before him, stroking his beard, while mrs kearney spoke into kathleenâ€™s ear with subdued emphasis. from the hall came sounds of encouragement, clappin

g and stamping of feet. the first tenor and the baritone and miss healy stood together, waiting tranquilly, but mr bellâ€™s nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience would think that he had come late.
mr holohan and mr oâ€™madden burke came into the room. in a moment mr holohan perceived the hush. he went over to mrs kearney and spoke with her earnestly. while they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder. mr holohan became very red and excited. he spoke volubly, but mrs kearney said curtly at intervals:
â€œshe wonâ€™t go on. she must get her eight guineas.â€
mr holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping and stamping. he appealed to mr kearney and to kathleen. but mr kearney continued to stroke his beard and kathleen looked down, moving the point of her new shoe: it was not her fault. mrs kearney repeated:
â€œshe wonâ€™t go on without her money.â€

f tongues mr holohan hobbled out in haste. the room was silent. when the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful miss healy said to the baritone:
â€œhave you seen mrs pat campbell this week?â€
the baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine. the conversation went no further. the first tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus. from time to tim

the noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when mr fitzpatrick burst into the room, followed by mr holohan, who was panting. the clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. mr fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand. he counted out four into mrs kearneyâ€™s hand and said she would get the other half at the interval. mrs kearney said:
â€œthis is four shillings short.â€
but kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: â€œnow, mr bell,â€ to the first item, who was shaking like an aspen. the singer and the accompanist went out together. the noise in hall died away. there was a pau

 cheaper parts of the hall made fun of her high wailing notes. the first tenor and the contralto, however, brought down the house. kathleen played a selection of irish airs which was generously applauded. the first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. it was deservedly applauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the interval, content.
all this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. in one corner were mr holohan, mr fitzpatrick, miss beirne, two of the stewards, the baritone, the bass, and mr oâ€™madden burke. mr oâ€™madden burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed. miss kathleen kearneyâ€™s musical career was ended in dublin after that, he said. the baritone was asked what did he think of mrs kearneyâ€™s conduct. he did not like to say anything. he had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with men. however, he said that mrs kearney might have taken the artistes in

hey didnâ€™t pay her to the last farthing she would make dublin ring. of course she was sorry for the sake of the artistes. but what else could she do? she appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had not been well treated. then she appealed to miss healy. miss healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great friend of kathleenâ€™s and the kearneys had often invited her to their house.
as soon as the first part was ended mr fitzpatrick and mr holohan went over to mrs kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the committee meeting on the following tuesday and that, in case her daughter did not play for the second part, the committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing.
â€œi havenâ€™t seen any committee,â€ said mrs kearney angrily. â€œmy daughter has her contract. she will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot she wonâ€™t put on that platform.â€
â€œiâ€™m surprised at you, mrs kearney,â

â€œand what way did you treat me?â€ asked mrs kearney.
her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands.
â€œiâ€™m asking for my rights.â€ she said.
â€œyou might have some sense of decency,â€ said mr holohan.
â€œmight i, indeed?... and when i ask when my daughter is going to be paid i canâ€™t get a civil answer.â€
she tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:
â€œyou must speak to the secretary. itâ€™s not my business. iâ€™m a great fellow fol-the-diddle-i-do.â€
â€œi thought you were a lady,â€ said mr holohan, walking away from her abruptly.
after that mrs kearneyâ€™s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone approved of what the committee had done. she stood at the door, haggard with rage,

 had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments. mrs kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform. she stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her daughterâ€™s cloak and said to her husband:
â€œget a cab!â€
he went out at once. mrs kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and followed him. as she passed through the doorway she stopped and glared into mr holohanâ€™s face.
â€œiâ€™m not done with you yet,â€ she said.
â€œbut iâ€™m done with you,â€ said mr holohan.
kathleen followed her mother meekly. mr holohan began to pace up and down the room, in order to cool himself for he felt his skin on fire.
â€œthatâ€™s a nice lady!â€ he said. â€œo, sheâ€™s a nice lady!â€
â€œyou did the proper thing, holohan,â€ said mr oâ€™madden burke, poised upon his umbrella in approval.
