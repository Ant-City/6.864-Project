Casca - 
                A
public figure opposed to Caesar's rise to power. Casca relates to
Cassius and Brutus how Antony offered the crown to Caesar three
times and how each time Caesar declined it. He believes, however,
that Caesar is the consummate actor, lulling the populace into believing
that he has no personal ambition.
