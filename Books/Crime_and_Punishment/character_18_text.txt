â€œthis way, this way! we must take him upstairs head foremost. turn round! iâ€™ll pay, iâ€™ll make it worth your while,â€ he muttered.
katerina ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself and coughing. of late she had begun to talk more than ever to her eldest girl, polenka, a child of ten, who, though there was much she did not understand, understood very well that her mother needed her, and so always watched her with her big clever eyes and strove her utmost to appear to understand. this time polenka was undressing her little brother, who had been unwell all day and was going to bed. the boy was waiting for her to take off his shirt, which had to be washed at night. he was sitting straight and motionless on a chair, with a silent, serious face, with his legs str

sed to go to bed. a little girl, still younger, dressed literally in rags, stood at the screen, waiting for her turn. the door on to the stairs was open to relieve them a little from the clouds of tobacco smoke which floated in from the other rooms and brought on long terrible fits of coughing in the poor, consumptive woman. katerina ivanovna seemed to have grown even thinner during that week and the hectic flush on her face was brighter than ever.
â€œyou wouldnâ€™t believe, you canâ€™t imagine, polenka,â€ she said, walking about the room, â€œwhat a happy luxurious life we had in my papaâ€™s house and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin! papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that everyone who came to see him said, â€˜we look upon you, ivan mihailovitch, as our governor!â€™ when i... when...â€ she coughed violently, â€œoh, cursed life,â€ she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her breast, â€œwhen i... when at the las

â€œon the sofa! put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,â€ raskolnikov showed him.
â€œrun over in the road! drunk!â€ someone shouted in the passage.
katerina ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. the children were terrified. little lida screamed, rushed to polenka and clutched at her, trembling all over.
having laid marmeladov down, raskolnikov flew to katerina ivanovna.
â€œfor godâ€™s sake be calm, donâ€™t be frightened!â€ he said, speaking quickly, â€œhe was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, donâ€™t be frightened, he will come to, i told them bring him here... iâ€™ve been here already, you remember? he will come to; iâ€™ll pay!â€
â€œheâ€™s done it this time!â€ katerina ivanovna cried despairingly and she rushed to her husband.

 marmeladovâ€™s face.
katerina ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands to her breast. she was in need of attention herself. raskolnikov began to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man brought here. the policeman, too, stood in hesitation.
â€œpolenka,â€ cried katerina ivanovna, â€œrun to sonia, make haste. if you donâ€™t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over and that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. run, polenka! there, put on the shawl.â€
â€œrun your fastest!â€ cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his heels thrust forward and his toes spread out.
meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldnâ€™t have dropped a pin. the policemen left, all except one, who remained for a time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. almost all madame lippevechselâ€™s lodgers had streamed in from the inner

ck her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling straight the boyâ€™s shirt, and managed to cover the girlâ€™s bare shoulders with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her knees or ceasing to pray. meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was opened inquisitively again. in the passage the crowd of spectators from all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not venture beyond the threshold. a single candle-end lighted up the scene.
at that moment polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. she came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for her mother, went up to her and said, â€œsheâ€™s coming, i met her in the street.â€ her mother made her kneel beside her.
timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd, and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags, death and despair. she, too, was in rags, her attire was all of the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of

he turned round. she was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped short a step above him. a dim light came in from the yard. raskolnikov could distinguish the childâ€™s thin but pretty little face, looking at him with a bright childish smile. she had run after him with a message which she was evidently glad to give.
â€œtell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?â€ she said hurriedly in a breathless voice.

â€œwho sent you?â€
â€œsister sonia sent me,â€ answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.
â€œi knew it was sister sonia sent you.â€
â€œmamma sent me, too... when sister sonia was sending me, mamma came up, too, and said â€˜run fast, polenka.â€™â€
â€œdo you love sister sonia?â€
â€œi love her more than anyone,â€ polenka answered with a peculiar earnestness, and her smile became graver.
â€œand will you love me?â€
by way of answer he saw the little girlâ€™s face approaching him, her full lips naÃ¯vely held out to kiss him. suddenly her arms as thin as sticks held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl wept softly, pressing her face against him.
â€œi am sorry for father,â€ she said a moment later, raising her tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. â€œitâ€™s nothi

â€œnever,â€ answered raskolnikov. â€œi have been meaning to buy a lock for these two years. people are happy who have no need of locks,â€ he said, laughing, to sonia. they stood still in the gateway.
â€œdo you go to the right, sofya semyonovna? how did you find me, by the way?â€ he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different. he wanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.
â€œwhy, you gave your address to polenka yesterday.â€
â€œpolenka? oh, yes; polenka, that is the little girl. she is your sister? did i give her the address?â€
â€œwhy, had you forgotten?â€
â€œno, i remember.â€
â€œi had heard my father speak of you... only i did not know your name, and he did not know it. and now i came... and as i had learnt your name, i asked to-day, â€˜where does mr. raskolnikov live?â€™ i did not know you had only a room too.... good-bye, i will tell katerina ivanovna.â€

â€œwell, after that i can understand your living like this,â€ raskolnikov said with a bitter smile.
â€œand arenâ€™t you sorry for them? arenâ€™t you sorry?â€ sonia flew at him again.

â€œand canâ€™t you save? put by for a rainy day?â€ he asked, stopping suddenly before her.
â€œno,â€ whispered sonia.
â€œof course not. have you tried?â€ he added almost ironically.
â€œyes.â€
â€œand it didnâ€™t come off! of course not! no need to ask.â€
and again he paced the room. another minute passed.
â€œyou donâ€™t get money every day?â€
sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.
â€œno,â€ she whispered with a painful effort.
â€œit will be the same with polenka, no doubt,â€ he said suddenly.
â€œno, no! it canâ€™t be, no!â€ sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though she had been stabbed. â€œgod would not allow anything so awful!â€
â€œhe lets others come to it.â€
â€œno, no! god will protect her, god!â€ she repeated beside herself.
â€œbut, perhaps, there is no god at all,â€ raskolnikov answered with a sort of malignance, laughed and looked at her.
soniaâ€™s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. she looked at him with unutterable reproach

eady. so we must go together on the same road! let us go!â€
â€œwhat for? whatâ€™s all this for?â€ said sonia, strangely and violently agitated by his words.
â€œwhat for? because you canâ€™t remain like this, thatâ€™s why! you must look things straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry that god wonâ€™t allow it. what will happen, if you should really be taken to the hospital to-morrow? she is mad and in consumption, sheâ€™ll soon die and the children? do you mean to tell me polenka wonâ€™t come to grief? havenâ€™t you seen children here at the street corners sent out by their mothers to beg? iâ€™ve found out where those mothers live and in what surroundings. children canâ€™t remain children there! at seven the child is vicious and a thief. yet children, you know, are the image of christ: â€˜theirs is the kingdom of heaven.â€™ he bade us honour and love them, they are the humanity of the future....â€
â€œwhatâ€™s to be done, whatâ€™s to be done?â€ repeated sonia, weeping

sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. she jumped up from time to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of polenka, katerina ivanovna and lizaveta, of reading the gospel and him... him with pale face, with burning eyes... kissing her feet, weeping.
on the other side of the door on the right, which divided soniaâ€™s room from madame resslichâ€™s flat, was a room which had long stood empty. a card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertising it to let. sonia had long been accustomed to the roomâ€™s being uninhabited. but all that time mr. svidrigaÃ¯lov had been standing,

, except the pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. the older and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away. pyotr petrovitch luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though katerina ivanovna had the evening before told all the world, that is amalia ivanovna, polenka, sonia and the pole, that he was the most generous, noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had been a friend of her first husbandâ€™s, and a guest in her fatherâ€™s house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her a considerable pension. it must be noted that when katerina ivanovna exalted anyoneâ€™s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person

the efforts of amalia ivanovna and the pole succeeded in removing him. the pole brought with him, however, two other poles who did not live at amalia ivanovnaâ€™s and whom no one had seen here before. all this irritated katerina ivanovna intensely. â€œfor whom had they made all these preparations then?â€ to make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while polenka as a big girl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like well-bred childrenâ€™s.
katerina ivanovna, in fact, could hardly help meeting her guests with increased dignity, and even haughtiness. she stared at some of them with special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. rushing to the conclusion that amalia ivanovna must be responsible for those who were absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the latter promptly observed and resen

ry good manners required! i canâ€™t understand why pyotr petrovitch has not come? but whereâ€™s sonia? where has she gone? ah, there she is at last! what is it, sonia, where have you been? itâ€™s odd that even at your fatherâ€™s funeral you should be so unpunctual. rodion romanovitch, make room for her beside you. thatâ€™s your place, sonia... take what you like. have some of the cold entrÃ©e with jelly, thatâ€™s the best. theyâ€™ll bring the pancakes directly. have they given the children some? polenka, have you got everything? (cough-cough-cough.) thatâ€™s all right. be a good girl, lida, and, kolya, donâ€™t fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman. what are you saying, sonia?â€
sonia hastened to give her pyotr petrovitchâ€™s apologies, trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most respectful phrases which she attributed to pyotr petrovitch. she added that pyotr petrovitch had particularly told her to say that, as soon as he possibly could, he wo

pyotr petrovitch stole a glance at raskolnikov. their eyes met, and the fire in raskolnikovâ€™s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. meanwhile katerina ivanovna apparently heard nothing. she was kissing and hugging sonia like a madwoman. the children, too, were embracing sonia on all sides, and polenkaâ€”though she did not fully understand what was wrongâ€”was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty little face, swollen with weeping, on soniaâ€™s shoulder.
â€œhow vile!â€ a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.
pyotr petrovitch looked round quickly.
â€œwhat vileness!â€ lebeziatnikov repeated, staring him straight in the face.
pyotr petrovitch gave a positive startâ€”all noticed it and recalled it afterwards. lebeziatnikov strode into the room.

and throwing over her head that green shawl which marmeladov had mentioned to raskolnikov, katerina ivanovna squeezed her way through the disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and, wailing and tearful, she ran into the streetâ€”with a vague intention of going at once somewhere to find justice. polenka with the two little ones i

lebeziatnikov would have gone on, but sonia, who had heard him almost breathless, snatched up her cloak and hat, and ran out of the room, putting on her things as she went. raskolnikov followed her and lebeziatnikov came after him.

â€œbring them back, bring them back, sonia! oh stupid, ungrateful children!... polenka! catch them.... itâ€™s for your sakes i...â€

thanks to the officialâ€™s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman even helping to carry katerina ivanovna. she was carried to soniaâ€™s room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. the blood was still flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. raskolnikov, lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied sonia into the room and were followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed to the very door. polenka came in holding kolya and lida, who were trembling and weeping. several persons came in too from the kapernaumovsâ€™ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. among these, svidrigaÃ¯lov suddenly made his appearance. raskolnikov looked at him with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not hav

meanwhile katerina ivanovna had regained her breath. the bleeding ceased for a time. she looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with a handkerchief. at last she asked to be raised. they sat her up on the bed, supporting her on both sides.
â€œwhere are the children?â€ she said in a faint voice. â€œyouâ€™ve brought them, polenka? oh the sillies! why did you run away.... och!â€
once more her parched lips were covered with blood. she moved her eyes, looking about her.
â€œso thatâ€™s how you live, sonia! never once have i been in your room.â€
she looked at her with a face of suffering.

she was violently excited and tried to sit up. at last, in a horribly hoarse, broken voice, she began, shrieking and gasping at every word, with a look of growing terror.

â€œenough! itâ€™s over! farewell, poor thing! i am done for! i am broken!â€ she cried with vindictive despair, and her head fell heavily back on the pillow.
she sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long. her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg moved convulsively, she gave a deep, deep sigh and died.
sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless with her head pressed to the dead womanâ€™s wasted bosom. polenka threw herself at her motherâ€™s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. though kolya and lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each otherâ€™s little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened their mouths and began screaming. they were both still in their fancy dress; one in a turban, the other in the cap with the ostrich feather.

lebeziatnikov at once made room for him and delicately withdrew. svidrigaÃ¯lov drew raskolnikov further away.
â€œi will undertake all the arrangements, the funeral and that. you know itâ€™s a question of money and, as i told you, i have plenty to spare. i will put those two little ones and polenka into some good orphan asylum, and i will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming of age, so that sofya semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. and i will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isnâ€™t she? so tell avdotya romanovna that that is how i am spending her ten thousand.â€

â€œwhy, i lodge here at madame resslichâ€™s, the other side of the wall. here is kapernaumov, and there lives madame resslich, an old and devoted friend of mine. i am a neighbour.â€
