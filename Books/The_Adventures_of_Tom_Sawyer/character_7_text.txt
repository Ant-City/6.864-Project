theyï¿½re _humans_! one of ï¿½em is, anyway. one of ï¿½emï¿½s old muff potterï¿½s
voice.ï¿½

ï¿½no--ï¿½tainï¿½t so, is it?ï¿½

ï¿½i bet i know it. donï¿½t you stir nor budge. he ainï¿½t sharp enough to
notice us. drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!ï¿½

ï¿½all right, iï¿½ll keep still. now theyï¿½re stuck. canï¿½t find it. here they
come again. now theyï¿½re hot. cold again. hot again. red hot! theyï¿½re
pï¿½inted right, this time. say, huck, i know another oï¿½ them voices; itï¿½s
injun joe.ï¿½

ï¿½thatï¿½s so--that murderinï¿½ half-breed! iï¿½d druther they was devils a dern
sight. what kin they be up to?ï¿½

the whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the
grave and stood within a few feet of the boysï¿½ hiding-place.

ï¿½here it is,ï¿½ said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern
up and revealed the face of young doctor robinson.

potter and injun joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple
of shovels on it. they cast down their load

their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. the
moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.
the barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a
blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. potter took out a large
spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:

ï¿½now the cussed thingï¿½s ready, sawbones, and youï¿½ll just out with
another five, or here she stays.ï¿½

ï¿½thatï¿½s the talk!ï¿½ said injun joe.

ï¿½look here, what does this mean?ï¿½ said the doctor. ï¿½you required your
pay in advance, and iï¿½ve paid you.ï¿½

ï¿½yes, and you done more than that,ï¿½ said injun joe, approaching the
doctor, who was now standing. ï¿½five years ago you drove me away from
your fatherï¿½s kitchen one night, when i come to ask for something to
eat, and you said i warnï¿½t there for any good; and when i swore iï¿½d get
even with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for
a vagrant. did you

nothing. and now iï¿½ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!ï¿½

he was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.
the doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.
potter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:

ï¿½here, now, donï¿½t you hit my pard!ï¿½ and the next moment he had grappled
with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,
trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. injun joe
sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up potterï¿½s
knife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about
the combatants, seeking an opportunity. all at once the doctor flung
himself free, seized the heavy headboard of williamsï¿½ grave and felled
potter to the earth with it--and in the same instant the half-breed saw
his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young manï¿½s breast. he
reeled and fell partly upon potter, flooding him with his blood, a

the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the
two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.

presently, when the moon emerged again, injun joe was standing over the
two forms, contemplating them. the doctor murmured inarticulately, gave
a long gasp or two and was still. the half-breed muttered:

ï¿½_that_ score is settled--damn you.ï¿½

then he robbed the body. after which he put the fatal knife in potterï¿½s
open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. three--four--five
minutes passed, and then potter began to stir and moan. his hand closed
upon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a
shudder. then

adily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst
through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
shadows beyond. by and by their pulses slowed down, and tom whispered:

ï¿½huckleberry, what do you reckonï¿½ll come of this?ï¿½

ï¿½if doctor robinson dies, i reckon hangingï¿½ll come of it.ï¿½

ï¿½do you though?ï¿½

ï¿½why, i _know_ it, tom.ï¿½

tom thought a while, then he said:

ï¿½whoï¿½ll tell? we?ï¿½

ï¿½what are you talking about? sï¿½pose something happened and injun joe
_didnï¿½t_ hang? why, heï¿½d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure
as weï¿½re a laying here.ï¿½

ï¿½thatï¿½s just what i was thinking to myself, huck.ï¿½

ï¿½if anybody tells, let muff potter do it, if heï¿½s fool enough. heï¿½s
generally drunk enough.ï¿½

tom said nothing--went on thinking. presently he whispered:

ï¿½huck, muff potter donï¿½t know it. how can he tell?ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½s the reason he donï¿½t know it?ï¿½

ï¿½because heï¿½d just got that whack when injun joe done it. dï¿½y

ng. no--itï¿½s somebody snoring, tom.ï¿½

ï¿½that _is_ it! where ï¿½bouts is it, huck?ï¿½

ï¿½i bleeve itï¿½s down at ï¿½tother end. sounds so, anyway. pap used to sleep
there, sometimes, ï¿½long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts
things when _he_ snores. besides, i reckon he ainï¿½t ever coming back to
this town any more.ï¿½

the spirit of adventure rose in the boysï¿½ souls once more.

ï¿½hucky, do you dasï¿½t to go if i lead?ï¿½

ï¿½i donï¿½t like to, much. tom, sï¿½pose itï¿½s injun joe!ï¿½

tom quailed. but presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their
heels if the snoring stopped. so they went tiptoeing stealthily down,
the one behind the other. when they had got to within five steps of the
snorer, tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. the man
moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. it was
muff potter. the boysï¿½ hearts had stood still, and their hopes

elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their
mutual glance. but everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly
spectacle before them.

ï¿½poor fellow!ï¿½ ï¿½poor young fellow!ï¿½ ï¿½this ought to be a lesson to grave
robbers!ï¿½ ï¿½muff potterï¿½ll hang for this if they catch him!ï¿½ this was the
drift of remark; and the minister said, ï¿½it was a judgment; his hand is
here.ï¿½

now tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid
face of injun joe. at this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,
and voices shouted, ï¿½itï¿½s him! itï¿½s him! heï¿½s coming himself!ï¿½

ï¿½who? who?ï¿½ from twenty voices.

ï¿½muff potter!ï¿½

ï¿½hallo, heï¿½s stopped!--look out, heï¿½s turning! donï¿½t let him get away!ï¿½

people in the branches of the trees over tomï¿½s head said he wasnï¿½t
trying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed.

ï¿½infernal impudence!ï¿½ said a bystander; ï¿½wanted to come and take a quiet
look at his work, i r

leading potter by the arm. the poor fellowï¿½s face was haggard, and
his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. when he stood before the
murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands
and burst into tears.

ï¿½i didnï¿½t do it, friends,ï¿½ he sobbed; ï¿½ï¿½pon my word and honor i never
done it.ï¿½

ï¿½whoï¿½s accused you?ï¿½ shouted a voice.

this shot seemed to carry home. potter lifted his face and looked around
him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. he saw injun joe, and
exclaimed:

ï¿½oh, injun joe, you promised me youï¿½d never--ï¿½

ï¿½is that your knife?ï¿½ and it was thrust before him by the sheriff.

potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the
ground. then he said:

ï¿½something told me ï¿½t if i didnï¿½t come back and get--ï¿½ he shuddered; then
waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, ï¿½tell ï¿½em,
joe, tell ï¿½em--it ainï¿½t any use any more.ï¿½

then huckleberry and tom stood dumb and staring, and

e, their wavering impulse to
break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisonerï¿½s life faded and
vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to satan and
it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.

ï¿½why didnï¿½t you leave? what did you want to come here for?ï¿½ somebody
said.

ï¿½i couldnï¿½t help it--i couldnï¿½t help it,ï¿½ potter moaned. ï¿½i wanted to
run away, but i couldnï¿½t seem to come anywhere but here.ï¿½ and he fell to
sobbing again.

injun joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes
afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the
lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that
joe had sold himself to the devil. he was now become, to them, the most
balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could
not take their fascinated eyes from his face.

they inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should
offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his drea

injun joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in
a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering
crowd that the wound bled a little! the boys thought that this happy
circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were
disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:

ï¿½it was within three feet of muff potter when it done it.ï¿½

tomï¿½s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after this; and at breakfast o

re tomï¿½s conscience.

every day or two, during this time of sorrow, tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such
small comforts through to the ï¿½murdererï¿½ as he could get hold of. the
jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it
was seldom occupied. these offerings greatly helped to ease tomï¿½s
conscience.

the villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather injun joe and ride
him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character
that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the
matter, so it was dropped. he had been careful to begin both of his
inquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery
that preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in
the courts at present.




chapter xii

one of the reasons why tomï¿½s mind had drifted away from its secret
troubles was, that it had found

almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.
huck was having the same experience. they studiously avoided each other.
each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination
always brought them back presently. tom kept his ears open when idlers
sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing
news--the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor
potter. at the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect
that injun joeï¿½s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was
not the slightest question as to what the juryï¿½s verdict would be.

tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. he
was in a tremendous state of excitement. it was hours before he got to
sleep. all the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for
this was to be the great day. both sexes were about equally represented
in the packed audience. after a long wait the jury filed in and took
their places; shortl

y afterward, potter, pale and haggard, timid and
hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all
the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was injun joe,
stolid as ever. there was another pause, and then the judge arrived and
the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. the usual whisperings
among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. these
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
that was as impressive as it was fascinating.

now a witness was called who testified that he found muff potter washing
in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was
discovered, and that he immedia

by drink. we have changed our mind. we shall not offer that plea.ï¿½ [then
to the clerk:] ï¿½call thomas sawyer!ï¿½

a puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting
potterï¿½s. every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon tom as
he rose and took his place upon the stand. the boy looked wild enough,
for he was badly scared. the oath was administered.

ï¿½thomas sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of june, about the
hour of midnight?ï¿½

tom glanced at injun joeï¿½s iron face and his tongue failed him. the
audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. after a few
moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed
to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:

ï¿½in the graveyard!ï¿½

ï¿½a little bit louder, please. donï¿½t be afraid. you were--ï¿½

ï¿½in the graveyard.ï¿½

a contemptuous smile flitted across injun joeï¿½s face.

ï¿½were you anywhere near horse williamsï¿½ grave?ï¿½

ï¿½yes, sir.

ï¿½

ï¿½speak up--just a trifle louder. how near were you?ï¿½

ï¿½near as i am to you.ï¿½

ï¿½were you hidden, or not?ï¿½

ï¿½i was hid.ï¿½

ï¿½where?ï¿½

ï¿½behind the elms thatï¿½s on the edge of the grave.ï¿½

injun joe gave a barely perceptible start.

ï¿½any one with you?ï¿½

ï¿½yes, sir. i went there with--ï¿½

ï¿½wait--wait a moment. never mind mentioning your companionï¿½s name. we
will produce him at the proper time. did you carry anything there with

tom hesitated and looked confused.

ï¿½speak out, my boy--donï¿½t be diffident. the truth is always respectable.
what did you take there?ï¿½

ï¿½only a--a--dead cat.ï¿½

there was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.

young. his name even went into immortal print, for the village paper
magnified him. there were some that believed he would be president, yet,
if he escaped hanging.

as usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took muff potter to its bosom
and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. but that sort
of conduct is to the worldï¿½s credit; therefore it is not well to find
fault with it.

tomï¿½s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights
were seasons of horror. injun joe infested all his dreams, and always
with doom in his eye. hardly any temptation could persuade the boy
to stir abroad after nightfall. poor huck was in the same state of
wretchedness and terror, for tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
the night before the great day of the trial, and huck was sore afraid
that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding
injun joeï¿½s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.
the poor fellow had got the attorney to promis

e secrecy, but what of
that? since tomï¿½s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
lawyerï¿½s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had
been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, huckï¿½s
confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.

daily muff potterï¿½s gratitude made tom glad he had spoken; but nightly
he wished he had sealed up his tongue.

half the time tom was afraid injun joe would never be captured; the
other half he was afraid he would be. he felt sure he never could draw a
safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.

rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no injun
joe was found. one of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels, a
detective, came up from st. louis, moused around, shook his head, looked
wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that
craft usually achieve. that is to say, he ï¿½fou

ey came in, ï¿½tï¿½otherï¿½ was talking in a low voice;
they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the
wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. his manner became less
guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:

ï¿½no,ï¿½ said he, ï¿½iï¿½ve thought it all over, and i donï¿½t like it. itï¿½s
dangerous.ï¿½

ï¿½dangerous!ï¿½ grunted the ï¿½deaf and dumbï¿½ spaniard--to the vast surprise
of the boys. ï¿½milksop!ï¿½

this voice made the boys gasp and quake. it was injun joeï¿½s! there was
silence for some time. then joe said:

ï¿½whatï¿½s any more dangerous than that job up yonder--but nothingï¿½s come of
it.ï¿½

ï¿½thatï¿½s different. away up the river so, and not another house about.
ï¿½twonï¿½t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didnï¿½t succeed.ï¿½

ï¿½well, whatï¿½s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!--anybody
would suspicion us that saw us.ï¿½

ï¿½i know that. but there warnï¿½t any other place as handy after that fool
of a job. i wa

nt to quit this shanty. i wanted to yesterday, only it
warnï¿½t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys
playing over there on the hill right in full view.ï¿½

ï¿½those infernal boysï¿½ quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,
and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was friday and
concluded to wait a day. they wished in their hearts they had waited a
year.

the two men got out some food and made a luncheon. after a long and
thoughtful silence, injun joe said:

ï¿½look here, lad--you go back up the river where you belong. wait there
till you hear from me. iï¿½ll take the chances on dropping into this town
just once more, for a look. weï¿½ll do that ï¿½dangerousï¿½ job after iï¿½ve
spied around a little and think things look well for it. then for texas!
weï¿½ll leg it together!ï¿½

this was satisfactory. both men presently fell to yawning, and injun joe
said:

ï¿½iï¿½m dead for sleep! itï¿½s your turn to watch.ï¿½

he curled down in the weeds an

d:

ï¿½i canï¿½t--iï¿½d die if they was to wake.ï¿½

tom urged--huck held back. at last tom rose slowly and softly, and
started alone. but the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak
from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. he never
made a second attempt. the boys lay there counting the dragging moments
till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;
and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.

now one snore ceased. injun joe sat up, stared around--smiled grimly upon
his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees--stirred him up with
his foot and said:

ï¿½here! _youï¿½re_ a watchman, ainï¿½t you! all right, though--nothingï¿½s
happened.ï¿½

ï¿½my! have i been asleep?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, partly, partly. nearly time for us to be moving, pard. whatï¿½ll we
do with what little swag weï¿½ve got left?ï¿½

ï¿½i donï¿½t know--leave it here as weï¿½ve always done, i reckon. no use to
take it away till we start south. six hundre

say come in the night as we used to do--itï¿½s better.ï¿½

ï¿½yes: but look here; it may be a good while before i get the right
chance at that job; accidents might happen; ï¿½tainï¿½t in such a very good
place; weï¿½ll just regularly bury it--and bury it deep.ï¿½

ï¿½good idea,ï¿½ said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,
raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled
pleasantly. he subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself
and as much for injun joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on
his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.

the boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. with
gloating eyes they watched every movement. luck!--the splendor of it was
beyond all imagination! six hundred dollars was money enough to make
half a dozen boys rich! here was treasure-hunting under the happiest
auspices--there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to
dig. they nudged each other every mome

 and weï¿½ll
see what itï¿½s here for. never mind, iï¿½ve broke a hole.ï¿½

he reached his hand in and drew it out--

ï¿½man, itï¿½s money!ï¿½

the two men examined the handful of coins. they were gold. the boys
above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.

joeï¿½s comrade said:

ï¿½weï¿½ll make quick work of this. thereï¿½s an old rusty pick over amongst
the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace--i saw it a
minute ago.ï¿½

he ran and brought the boysï¿½ pick and shovel. injun joe took the
pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to
himself, and then began to use it. the box was soon unearthed. it was
not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the
slow years had injured it. the men contemplated the treasure awhile in
blissful silence.

ï¿½pard, thereï¿½s thousands of dollars here,ï¿½ said injun joe.

ï¿½ï¿½twas always said that murrelï¿½s gang used to be around here one
summer,ï¿½ the stranger observed.

ï¿½i know it,ï¿½

said injun joe; ï¿½and this looks like it, i should say.ï¿½

ï¿½now you wonï¿½t need to do that job.ï¿½

the halfbreed frowned. said he:

robbery altogether--itï¿½s _revenge_!ï¿½ and a wicked light flamed in his
eyes. ï¿½iï¿½ll need your help in it. when itï¿½s finished--then texas. go home

see the ground disturbed? not exactly--not exactly. weï¿½ll take it to my

ï¿½no--number two--under the cross. the other place is bad--too common.ï¿½

ï¿½all right. itï¿½s nearly dark enough to start.ï¿½

injun joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping
out. presently he said:

ï¿½who could have brought those tools here? do you reckon they can be
upstairs?ï¿½

the boysï¿½ breath forsook them. injun joe put his hand on his knife,
halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. the
boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. the steps came
creaking up the stairs--the intolerable distress of the situation woke
the stricken resolution of the lads--they wer

e about to spring for the
closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and injun joe landed on
the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. he gathered himself
up cursing, and his comrade said:

let them _stay_ there--who cares? if they want to jump down, now, and get

d out of the house in the deepening
twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.

tom and huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them
through the chinks between the logs of the house. follow? not they. they
were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the
townward track over the hill. they did not talk much. they were too much
absorbed in hating themselves--hating the ill luck that made them take
the spade and the pick there. but for that, injun joe never would have
suspected. he would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait
there till his ï¿½revengeï¿½ was satisfied, and then he would have had the
misfortune to find that money turn up missing. bitter, bitter luck that
the tools were ever brought there!

they resolved to keep a lookout for that spaniard when he should come to
town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to
ï¿½number two,ï¿½ wherever that might be. then a ghastly thought occurred to
tom.

on thatï¿½s the very no. 2 weï¿½re
after.ï¿½

ï¿½i reckon it is, tom. now what you going to do?ï¿½

ï¿½lemme think.ï¿½

tom thought a long time. then he said:

ï¿½iï¿½ll tell you. the back door of that no. 2 is the door that comes out
into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap
of a brick store. now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and
iï¿½ll nip all of auntieï¿½s, and the first dark night weï¿½ll go there and
try ï¿½em. and mind you, keep a lookout for injun joe, because he said he
was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get
his revenge. if you see him, you just follow him; and if he donï¿½t go to
that no. 2, that ainï¿½t the place.ï¿½

ï¿½lordy, i donï¿½t want to foller him by myself!ï¿½

ï¿½why, itï¿½ll be night, sure. he mightnï¿½t ever see you--and if he did,
maybe heï¿½d never think anything.ï¿½

ï¿½well, if itï¿½s pretty dark i reckon iï¿½ll track him. i dono--i dono. iï¿½ll
try.ï¿½

ï¿½you bet iï¿½ll follow him, if i

as tom got his breath he said:

ï¿½huck, it was awful! i tried two of the keys, just as soft as i could;
but they seemed to make such a power of racket that i couldnï¿½t hardly
get my breath i was so scared. they wouldnï¿½t turn in the lock, either.
well, without noticing what i was doing, i took hold of the knob, and
open comes the door! it warnï¿½t locked! i hopped in, and shook off the
towel, and, _great caesarï¿½s ghost!_ï¿½

ï¿½what!--whatï¿½d you see, tom?ï¿½

ï¿½huck, i most stepped onto injun joeï¿½s hand!ï¿½

ï¿½no!ï¿½

ï¿½yes! he was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch
on his eye and his arms spread out.ï¿½

ï¿½lordy, what did you do? did he wake up?ï¿½

ï¿½no, never budged. drunk, i reckon. i just grabbed that towel and
started!ï¿½

ï¿½iï¿½d never ï¿½aï¿½ thought of the towel, i bet!ï¿½

ï¿½well, i would. my aunt would make me mighty sick if i lost it.ï¿½

ï¿½say, tom, did you see that box?ï¿½

ï¿½huck, i didnï¿½t wait to look around. i didnï¿½t see the box, i

didnï¿½t see
the cross. i didnï¿½t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor
by injun joe; yes, i saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.
donï¿½t you see, now, whatï¿½s the matter with that haï¿½nted room?ï¿½

ï¿½how?ï¿½

ï¿½why, itï¿½s haï¿½nted with whiskey! maybe _all_ the temperance taverns have
got a haï¿½nted room, hey, huck?ï¿½

ï¿½well, i reckon maybe thatï¿½s so. whoï¿½d ï¿½aï¿½ thought such a thing? but
say, tom, nowï¿½s a mighty good time to get that box, if injun joeï¿½s
drunk.ï¿½

ï¿½it is, that! you try it!ï¿½

huck shuddered.

ï¿½well, no--i reckon not.ï¿½

ï¿½and i reckon not, huck. only one bottle alongside of injun joe ainï¿½t
enough. if thereï¿½d been three, heï¿½d be drunk enough and iï¿½d do it.ï¿½

there was a long pause for reflection, and then tom said:

ï¿½lookyhere, huck, less not try that thing any more till we know injun
joeï¿½s not in there. itï¿½s too scary. now, if we watch every night, weï¿½ll
be dead sure to see him go out, some time or

you neednï¿½t tell that. a bodyï¿½s got to do things when heï¿½s awful hungry
he wouldnï¿½t want to do as a steady thing.ï¿½

ï¿½well, if i donï¿½t want you in the daytime, iï¿½ll let you sleep. i wonï¿½t
come bothering around. any time you see somethingï¿½s up, in the night,
just skip right around and maow.ï¿½




chapter xxix

the first thing tom heard on friday morning was a glad piece of
news--judge thatcherï¿½s family had come back to town the night before.
both injun joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a
moment, and becky took the chief place in the boyï¿½s interest. he saw her
and they had an exhausting good time playing ï¿½hispyï¿½ and ï¿½gully-keeperï¿½
 with a crowd of their schoolmates. the day was completed and crowned in
a peculiarly satisfactory way: becky teased her mother to appoint
the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she
consented. the childï¿½s delight was boundless; and tomï¿½s not more
moderate. the

ged feet, when a man
cleared his throat not four feet from him! huckï¿½s heart shot into his
throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as
if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he
thought he must surely fall to the ground. he knew where he was. he
knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into widow douglasï¿½
grounds. very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it wonï¿½t be hard
to find.

now there was a voice--a very low voice--injun joeï¿½s:

ï¿½damn her, maybe sheï¿½s got company--thereï¿½s lights, late as it is.ï¿½

ï¿½i canï¿½t see any.ï¿½

this was that strangerï¿½s voice--the stranger of the haunted house. a
deadly chill went to huckï¿½s heart--this, then, was the ï¿½revengeï¿½ job! his
thought was, to fly. then he remembered that the widow douglas had been
kind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder
her. he wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didnï¿½t
dare--they might come and cat

ch him. he thought all this and more in
the moment that elapsed between the strangerï¿½s remark and injun joeï¿½s
next--which was--

ï¿½because the bush is in your way. now--this way--now you see, donï¿½t you?ï¿½

ï¿½yes. well, there _is_ company there, i reckon. better give it up.ï¿½

ï¿½give it up, and i just leaving this country forever! give it up and
maybe never have another chance. i tell you again, as iï¿½ve told you
before, i donï¿½t care for her swag--you may have it. but her husband was
rough on me--many times he was rough on me--and mainly he was the justice
of the peace that jugged me for a

be afraid of me. i wouldnï¿½t hurt a hair of your head for
all the world. no--iï¿½d protect you--iï¿½d protect you. this spaniard is
not deaf and dumb; youï¿½ve let that slip without intending it; you canï¿½t
cover that up now. you know something about that spaniard that you want
to keep dark. now trust me--tell me what it is, and trust me--i wonï¿½t
betray you.ï¿½

huck looked into the old manï¿½s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and
whispered in his ear:

ï¿½ï¿½tainï¿½t a spaniard--itï¿½s injun joe!ï¿½

the welshman almost jumped out of his chair. in a moment he said:

ï¿½itï¿½s all plain enough, now. when you talked about notching ears and
slitting noses i judged that that was your own embellishment, because
white men donï¿½t take that sort of revenge. but an injun! thatï¿½s a
different matter altogether.ï¿½

during breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man
said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going
to bed, was to get a lantern and examine

tly gratified the
next moment, to see the ï¿½spaniardï¿½ take to his heels and get himself out
of sight. tom wondered that joe had not recognized his voice and come
over and killed him for testifying in court. but the echoes must have
disguised the voice. without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. tomï¿½s
fright weakened every muscle in his body. he said to himself that if he
had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and
nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting injun joe again. he
was careful to keep from becky what it was he had seen. he told her he
had only shouted ï¿½for luck.ï¿½

but hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.
another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought
changes. the children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. tom believed
that it must be wednesday or thursday or even friday or saturday, now,
and that the search had been given over. he proposed to explore another
passage. he felt willing to risk in

but we have taken care of that. nobody will get lost in that cave any
more.ï¿½

ï¿½why?ï¿½

ï¿½because i had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and
triple-locked--and iï¿½ve got the keys.ï¿½

tom turned as white as a sheet.

ï¿½whatï¿½s the matter, boy! here, run, somebody! fetch a glass of water!ï¿½

the water was brought and thrown into tomï¿½s face.

ï¿½ah, now youï¿½re all right. what was the matter with you, tom?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, judge, injun joeï¿½s in the cave!ï¿½




chapter xxxiii

within a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of
men were on their way to mcdougalï¿½s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled
with passengers, soon followed. tom sawyer was in the skiff that bore
judge thatcher.

when the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the place. injun joe lay stretched upon the ground,
dead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
eyes had been f

ixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
of the free world outside. tom was touched, for he knew by his own
experience how this wretch had suffered. his pity was moved, but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,
which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.

injun joeï¿½s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. the great
foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with
tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a
sill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought
no effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. but if there
had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless
still, for if the beam had been wholly cut away injun joe could not have

on. has everything a
purpose and a mission? did this drop fall patiently during five thousand
years to be ready for this flitting human insectï¿½s need? and has it
another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? no
matter. it is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped
out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist
stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when
he comes to see the wonders of mcdougalï¿½s cave. injun joeï¿½s cup stands
first in the list of the cavernï¿½s marvels; even ï¿½aladdinï¿½s palaceï¿½
 cannot rival it.

injun joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked
there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and
all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as
satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the
hanging.

this funeral stopped the further growth of one

thing--the petition to the
governor for injun joeï¿½s pardon. the petition had been largely signed;
many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of
sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the
governor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty
under foot. injun joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the
village, but what of that? if he had been satan himself there would
have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a
pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired
and leaky water-works.

the morning after the funeral tom took huck to a private place to have
an important talk. huck had learned all about tomï¿½s adventure from the
welshman and the widow douglas, by this time, but tom said he reckoned
there w

t whiskey business; and i knowed you
hadnï¿½t got the money becuz youï¿½d ï¿½aï¿½ got at me some way or other and
told me even if you was mum to everybody else. tom, somethingï¿½s always
told me weï¿½d never get holt of that swag.ï¿½

ï¿½why, huck, i never told on that tavern-keeper. _you_ know his tavern
was all right the saturday i went to the picnic. donï¿½t you remember you
was to watch there that night?ï¿½

ï¿½oh yes! why, it seems ï¿½bout a year ago. it was that very night that i
follered injun joe to the widderï¿½s.ï¿½

ï¿½_you_ followed him?ï¿½

ï¿½yes--but you keep mum. i reckon injun joeï¿½s left friends behind him, and
i donï¿½t want ï¿½em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. if it hadnï¿½t
ben for me heï¿½d be down in texas now, all right.ï¿½

then huck told his entire adventure in confidence to tom, who had only
heard of the welshmanï¿½s part of it before.

ï¿½well,ï¿½ said huck, presently, coming back to the main question, ï¿½whoever

ï¿½jumping-off place.ï¿½ the candles revealed the fact that it was not
really a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet
high. tom whispered:

ï¿½now iï¿½ll show you something, huck.ï¿½

he held his candle aloft and said:

ï¿½look as far around the corner as you can. do you see that? there--on the
big rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.ï¿½

ï¿½tom, itï¿½s a _cross_!ï¿½

ï¿½_now_ whereï¿½s your number two? ï¿½_under the cross_,ï¿½ hey? right yonderï¿½s
where i saw injun joe poke up his candle, huck!ï¿½

huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:

ï¿½tom, less git out of here!ï¿½

ï¿½what! and leave the treasure?ï¿½

ï¿½yes--leave it. injun joeï¿½s ghost is round about there, certain.ï¿½

ï¿½no it ainï¿½t, huck, no it ainï¿½t. it would haï¿½nt the place where he
died--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.ï¿½

ï¿½no, tom, it wouldnï¿½t. it would hang round the money. i know the ways of
ghosts, and so do you.ï¿½

but presently an idea occurred to him--

ï¿½lookyhere, huck, what fools weï¿½re making of ourselves! injun joeï¿½s
ghost ainï¿½t a going to come around where thereï¿½s a cross!ï¿½

the point was well taken. it had its effect.

ï¿½tom, i didnï¿½t think of that. but thatï¿½s so. itï¿½s luck for us, that
cross is. i reckon weï¿½ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.ï¿½

tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.
huck followed. four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the
great rock stood in. the boys examined three of them with no result.
they found a small rec
