Portia - 
                Brutus's
wife; the daughter of a noble Roman who took sides against Caesar.
Portia, accustomed to being Brutus's confidante, is upset to find
him so reluctant to speak his mind when she finds him troubled.
Brutus later hears that Portia has killed herself out of grief that Antony
and Octavius have become so powerful.
