Pheidippides - 
      The spend-thrift and arrogant son of Strepsiades. He has adopted the aristocratic posturing of his mother and Uncle Megacles and demonstrates a passion for horses as well as a passion for esoteric knowledge. He is cocky and smug and proves a receptive pupil for the subtle rhetoric taught by Socrates. He is fascinated by himself--at first, his own material needs and finally his own whirling dervish of an intellect--and his egotism makes him cruel and ruthless.
