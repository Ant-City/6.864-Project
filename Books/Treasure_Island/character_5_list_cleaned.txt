the captain of the voyage to treasure island. captain
smollett is savvy and is rightly suspicious of the crew trelawney
has hired. smollett is a real professional, taking his job seriously
and displaying significant skill as a negotiator. like livesey,

jim's teenage mind. smollett believes in rules and does not like
jim's disobedience; he even tells jim that he never wishes to sail
with him again.
