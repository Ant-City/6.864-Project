Calpurnia - 
                 Caesar's
wife. Calpurnia invests great authority in omens and portents. She
warns Caesar against going to the Senate on the Ides of March, since
she has had terrible nightmares and heard reports of many bad omens.
Nevertheless, Caesar's ambition ultimately causes him to disregard
her advice.
