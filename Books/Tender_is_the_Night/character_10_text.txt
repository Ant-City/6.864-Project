, he devoted his attention entirely to the champagne.
rosemaryâ€™s glance moved at intervals around the table,
eager for the othersâ€™ enjoyment, as if they were her future
stepchildren. a gracious table light, emanating from a bowl

of spicy pinks, fell upon mrs. abramsâ€™ face, cooked to a turn
in veuve cliquot, full of vigor, tolerance, adolescent good
will; next to her sat mr. royal dumphry, his girlâ€™s comeliness
less startling in the pleasure world of evening. then
violet mckisco, whose prettiness had been piped to the surface
of her, so that she ceased her struggle to make tangible
to herself her shadowy position as the wife of an arriviste
who had not arrived.
then came dick, with his arms full of the slack he had
taken up from others, deeply merged in his own party.
then her mother, forever perfect.

that made rosemary like him again. then nicole.

them. rosemary watched nicole pressing upon her mother
a yellow evening bag she had admired, saying, â€˜i think
things ought to belong to the people that like themâ€™â€”and
then sweeping into it all the yellow articles she could find,
a pencil, a lipstick, a little note book, â€˜because they all go
together.â€™
nicole disappeared and presently rosemary noticed that
dick was no longer there; the guests distributed themselves
in the garden or drifted in toward the terrace.
â€˜do you want,â€™ violet mckisco asked rosemary, â€˜to go to
the bathroom?â€™
not at that precise moment.
â€˜i want,â€™ insisted mrs. mckisco, â€˜to go to the bathroom.â€™
as a frank outspoken woman she walked toward the house,
dragging her secret after her, while rosemary looked after
with reprobation. earl brady proposed that they walk down
to the sea wall but she felt that this was her time to have a
share of dick diver when he reappeared, so she stalled, listening
to mckisco quarrel with barban.
â€˜why do you want to fight

â€˜iâ€™ll tell you from the beginning.â€™ he drew a long breath
and then said, as if it were rather to her discredit but he
wouldnâ€™t hold it against her. â€˜of course, you were in the other
automobile. well, in a way you were luckyâ€”i lost at least
two years of my life, it came so suddenly.â€™
â€˜what came?â€™ she demanded.

â€˜i donâ€™t know what began it. first she began to talkâ€”â€˜
â€˜who?â€™
â€˜violet mckisco.â€™ he lowered his voice as if there were
people under the bench. â€˜but donâ€™t mention the divers because
he made threats against anybody who mentioned it.â€™
â€˜who did?â€™
â€˜tommy barban, so donâ€™t you say i so much as mentioned
them. none of us ever found out anyhow what it was violet
had to say because he kept interrupting her, and then her
husband got into it and now, my dear, we have the duel. this
morningâ€”at five oâ€™clockâ€”in an hour.â€™ he sighed suddenly

the trouble began at the time earl bradyâ€™s car passed the
diversâ€™ car stopped on the roadâ€”abeâ€™s account melted impersonally
into the thronged nightâ€”violet mckisco was
telling mrs. abrams something she had found out about
the diversâ€”she had gone upstairs in their house and she
had come upon something there which had made a great
impression on her. but tommy is a watch-dog about the
divers. as a matter of fact she is inspiring and formidableâ€”
but itâ€™s a mutual thing, and the fact of the divers together is
more important to their friends than many of them realize.
of course itâ€™s done at a certain sacrificeâ€”sometimes they
seem just rather charming

thereâ€™s where he made his mistake because tommy, being
french, leaned over and clapped him one, and then the
chauffeur drove on. that was where you passed them. then
the women began. that was still the state of things when the
car got to the hotel.
tommy telephoned some man in cannes to act as second
and mckisco said he wasnâ€™t going to be seconded by
campion, who wasnâ€™t crazy for the job anyhow, so he telephoned
me not to say anything but to come right down.
violet mckisco collapsed and mrs. abrams took her to her
room and gave her a bromide whereupon she fell comfortably
asleep on the bed. when i got there i tried to argue with
tommy but the latter wouldnâ€™t accept anything short of an
apology and mckisco rather spunkily wouldnâ€™t give it.
when abe had finished rosemary asked thoughtfully:
â€˜do the divers know it was about them?â€™
â€˜noâ€”and theyâ€™re not ever going to know they had any-
