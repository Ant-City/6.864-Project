the [CHARACTER]
the [CHARACTER] of "the yellow wallpaper" is a paradox: as she loses touch
with the outer world, she comes to a greater understanding of the inner reality
of her life. this inner/outer split is crucial to understanding the nature of
the [CHARACTER]'s suffering. at every point, she is faced with relationships,
objects, and situations that seem innocent and natural but that are actually
quite bizarre and even oppressive. in a sense, the plot of "the yellow
wallpaper" is the [CHARACTER]'s attempt to avoid acknowledging the
extent to which her external situation stifles her inner impulses. from the
beginning, we see that the [CHARACTER] is an imaginative, highly expressive woman.
she remembers terrifying herself with imaginary nighttime monsters as a child,
and she enjoys the notion that the house they have taken is haunted. yet as part
of her "cure," her husband forbids her to exercise her imagination in any way.
both her reason and her emotions rebel at this treatment, and she turns her
imagination onto seemingly neutral objects--the house and the wallpaper--in an
attempt to ignore her growing frustration. her negative feelings color her
description of her surroundings, making them seem uncanny and sinister, and she
becomes fixated on the wallpaper.

as the [CHARACTER] sinks further into her inner fascination with the
wallpaper, she becomes progressively more dissociated from her day-to-day life.
this process of dissociation begins when the story does, at the very moment she
decides to keep a secret diary as "a relief to her mind." from that point, her
true thoughts are hidden from the outer world, and the [CHARACTER] begins to slip
into a fantasy world in which the nature of "her situation" is made clear in
symbolic terms. gilman shows us this division in the [CHARACTER]'s consciousness by
having the [CHARACTER] puzzle over effects in the world that she herself has
caused. for example, the [CHARACTER] doesn't immediately understand that the yellow
stains on her clothing and the long "smootch" on the wallpaper are connected.
similarly, the [CHARACTER] fights the realization that the predicament of the woman
in the wallpaper is a symbolic version of her own situation. at first she even
disapproves of the woman's efforts to escape and intends to "tie her up."
when the [CHARACTER] finally identifies herself with the woman trapped in the
wallpaper, she is able to see that other women are forced to creep and hide
behind the domestic "patterns" of their lives, and that she herself is the one
in need of rescue. the horror of this story is that the [CHARACTER] must lose
herself to understand herself. she has untangled the pattern of her life, but
she has torn herself apart in getting free of it. an odd detail at the end of
the story reveals how much the [CHARACTER] has sacrificed. during her final split
from reality, the [CHARACTER] says, "i've got out at last, in spite of you and
jane." who is this jane? some critics claim "jane" is a misprint for "jennie,"
the sister-in-law. it is more likely, however, that "jane" is the name of the
unnamed [CHARACTER], who has been a stranger to herself and her jailers. now she is
horribly "free" of the constraints of her marriage, her society, and her own
efforts to repress her mind.
