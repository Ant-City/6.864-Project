  reignier. fair maid, is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
  pucelle. reignier, is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
    where is the dauphin? come, come from behind;
    i know thee well, though never seen before.
    be not amaz'd, there's nothing hid from me.
    in private will i talk with thee apart.
    stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
  reignier. she takes upon her bravely at first dash.
  pucelle. dauphin, i am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
    my wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
    heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleas'd
    to shine on my contemptible estate.
    lo, whilst i waited on my tender lambs
    and to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
    god's mother deigned to appear to me,
    and in a vision full of majesty
    will'd me to leave my base vocation
    and free my country from calamity
    her aid she promis'd and assur'd success.
    in complete glory she reveal'd herself;

                               scene 4.

                  camp of the duke of york in anjou

                   enter york, warwick, and others

  york. bring forth that sorceress, condemn'd to burn.

              enter la pucelle, guarded, and a shepherd

  shepherd. ah, joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!
    have i sought every country far and near,
    and, now it is my chance to find thee out,
    must i behold thy timeless cruel death?
    ah, joan, sweet daughter joan, i'll die with thee!
  pucelle. decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
    i am descended of a gentler blood;
    thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
  shepherd. out, out! my lords, an please you, 'tis not so;
    i did beget her, all the parish know

    her mother liveth yet, can testify
    she was the first fruit of my bach'lorship.
  warwick. graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage?
  york. this argues what her kind of life hath been--
    wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.
  shepherd. fie, joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
    god knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
    and for thy sake have i shed many a tear.
    deny me not, i prithee, gentle joan.
  pucelle. peasant, avaunt! you have suborn'd this man
    of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
  shepherd. 'tis true, i gave a noble to the priest
    the morn that i was wedded to her mother.
    kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
    wilt thou not stoop? now cursed be the time
    of thy nativity.

    thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast
    had been a little ratsbane for thy sake.
    or else, when thou didst keep my lambs afield,
    i wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee.
    dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?
    o, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.             exit
  york. take her away; for she hath liv'd too long,
    to fill the world with vicious qualities.
  pucelle. first let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:
    not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
    but issued from the progeny of kings;
    virtuous and holy, chosen from above
    by inspiration of celestial grace,
    to work exceeding miracles on earth.
    i never had to do with wicked spirits.
    but you, that are polluted with your lusts,
    stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,
    corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,
    because you want the grace that others have,
    you judge it straight a thing impossible
    to compass wonders but by help
