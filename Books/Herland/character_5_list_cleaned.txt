[CHARACTER] - 
one of the three explorers who discovers herland. terry is the
driving force behind the expedition to herland and the most forceful of the
three friends. a classic male chauvinist, terry fancies himself quite the
ladies' man and prides himself on his knowledge of and control over the female
mind. convinced that women like to be "mastered" both emotionally and physically
by men, terry is completely flummoxed by the women of herland, who don't need
men at all. terry is unable to relate to women as equals, and this inability
dooms his relationship with alima.
