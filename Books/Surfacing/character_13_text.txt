 him like a priest or a porcelain
mandarin; he doesnâ€™t say anything else. we stand there on either side of the fence,
our faces petrified in well-intentioned curves, mouths wreathed in parentheses, until
i say â€œhas he come back yet?â€
at this his chin plummets, his head teeters on his neck. â€œah. no.â€ he gazes
sideways, accusingly, down at a potato plant near his left foot. then his head jerks
up again and he says gaily, â€œnot yet, ay? but maybe soon. your fadder, he knows the
bush.â€
madame has appeared in the kitchen doorway and paul speaks with her in the
nasal slanted french i canâ€™t interpret because i learned all but a few early words of
mine in school. folk songs and christmas carols and, from the later grades,
memorized passages of racine and baudelaire are no help to me here.
â€œyou must come in,â€ he says to me, â€œand take a tea,â€ and he bends and undoes the
hook of the wooden gate. i go forward to the door where madame is waiting for
me, hands outstretched in welcom

madame makes the tea on a new electric stove, a blue ceramic madonna with pink
child hanging above it; when i glimpsed the stove on my way through the kitchen i
felt betrayed, she should have remained loyal to her wood range. we sit on the
screened porch overlooking the lake, balancing our teacups and rocking side by
side in three rocking chairs; iâ€™ve been given the store cushion, which has an
embroidered view of niagara falls. the black and white collie, either the identical

madame, who is the same thickness all the way down, is in a long-skirted dress
and black stockings and a print apron with a bib, paul in high-waisted trousers with
braces, flannel shirt-sleeves rolled. iâ€™m annoyed with them for looking so much like
carvings, the habitant kind they sell in tourist handicraft shops; but of course itâ€™s the
other way around, itâ€™s the carvings that look like them. i wonder what they think i
look like, they may find my jeans and sweatshirt and fringed over-the-shoulde

strange, perhaps immoral, though such things may be more common in the village
since the tourists and the t.v.; besides, i can be forgiven because my family was, by
reputation, peculiar as well as anglais.
i lift my cup, they are watching me anxiously: itâ€™s imperative that i mention the
tea. â€œtrÃ¨s bon,â€ i manage to get out in the direction of madame. â€œdÃ©licieux.â€ doubt
seizes me, thÃ© may be feminine.
what iâ€™m remembering are the visits our mother was obliged to pay madame
while our father was visiting paul. my father and paul would be outside, talking
about boats or motors or forest fires or one of their expeditions, and my mother
and madame would be inside in the rocking chairs (my mother with the niagara
falls cushion), trying with great goodwill to make conversation. neither knew more
than five words of the otherâ€™s language and after the opening bonjours both would
unconsciously raise their voices as though talking to a deaf person.
â€œil fait beau,â€ my m

other would shout, no matter what the weather was like, and
madame would grin with strain and say â€œpardon? ah, il fait beau, oui, il fait beau,
ban oui.â€ when she had ground to a stop both would think desperately, chairs
rocking.
â€œ â€™ow are you?â€ madame would scream, and my mother, after deciphering this,
would say â€œfine, i am fine.â€ then she would repeat the question: â€œhow are you,
madame?â€ but madame would not have the answer and both, still smiling, would
glance furtively out through the screen to see if the men were yet coming to rescue
them.
meanwhile my father would be giving paul the cabbages or the string beans he
had brought from his garden and paul would be replying with tomatoes or lettuces
from his. since their gardens had the same things in them this exchange of
vegetables was purely ritual: after it had taken place we would know the visit would
be officially over.

ring her tea now and sighing. she says something to paul and paul
says, â€œyour mother, she was a good woman, madame says it is very sad; so young
too.â€
â€œyes,â€ i say. mother and madame were about the same age and no-one would call
madame young; but then my mother never got fat like madame.
i went to see her in the hospital, where she allowed herself to be taken only when
she could no longer walk; one of the doctors told me that. she must have concealed
the pain for weeks, tricked my father into believing it was only one of her usual
headaches, that would be her kind of lie. she hated hospitals and doctors; she must
have been afraid they would experiment on her, keep her alive as long as they could
with tubes and needles even though it was what they call terminal, in the head it

â€™s here,â€ i say, skipping over the lie even in my own mind. what he means
is that a man should be handling this; joe will do as a stand-in. my status is a
problem, they obviously think iâ€™m married. but iâ€™m safe, iâ€™m wearing my ring, i
never threw it out, itâ€™s useful for landladies. i sent my parents a postcard after the
wedding, they must have mentioned it to paul; that, but not the divorce. it isnâ€™t part
of the vocabulary here, thereâ€™s no reason to upset them.
iâ€™m waiting for madame to ask about the baby, iâ€™m prepared, alerted, iâ€™ll tell her i
left him in the city; that would be perfectly true, only it was a different city, heâ€™s
better off with my husband, former husband.
but madame doesnâ€™t mention it, she lifts another cube of sugar from the tray by
her side and he intrudes, across from me, a coffee shop, not city but roadside, on the
way to or from somewhere, some goal or encounter. he peels the advertisement
paper from the sugar and lets one square fall into the

hers, also some eggs and bacon,
bread and butter, miscellaneous tins. everything is more expensive here than in the
city; no one keeps hens or cows or pigs any more, itâ€™s all imported from more
fertile districts. the bread is in wax paper wrappers, tranchÃ©.
i would like to back out the door, i donâ€™t want them staring at me from behind; but
i force myself to walk slowly, frontwards.
there used to be only one store. it was in the front part of a house, run by an old
woman who was also called madame: none of the women had names then. madame
sold khaki-coloured penny candies which we were forbidden to eat, but her main
source of power was that she had only one hand. her other arm ended in a soft pink
snout like an elephantâ€™s trunk and she broke the parcel string by wrapping it around
her stump and pulling. this arm devoid of a hand was for me a great mystery,
almost as puzzling as jesus. i wanted to know how the hand had come off (perhaps
she had taken it off herself) and where it was now

but the truth is that i donâ€™t know what the villagers thought or talked about, i was
so shut off from them. the older ones occasionally crossed themselves when we
passed, possibly because my mother was wearing slacks, but even that was never
explained. although we played during visits with the solemn, slightly hostile
children of paul and madame, the games were brief and wordless. we never could
find out what went on inside the tiny hillside church they filed into on sundays: our
parents wouldnâ€™t let us sneak up and peer through the windows, which made it illicit
and attractive. after my brother began going to school in the winters he told me it
was called the mass and what they did inside was eat; i imagined it as a sort of
birthday party, with ice cream â€“ birthday parties were my only experience then of
people eating in groups â€

ep it in mind.â€
i took paul by the arm and led him to the garden, as though to reciprocate for the
vegetables: i felt i had to explain, at least to him, he had gone to a lot of trouble for
me.
â€œyour garden, she is not doing so good, ay?â€ he said, inspecting.
â€œno,â€ i said, â€œwe just got it weeded; but i want you to have â€¦â€ i gazed
desperately around, seized on a withered lettuce and presented it to him, roots and
all, as gracefully as i could.
he held it, blinking, discouraged. â€œmadame will like that,â€ he said.
â€œpaul,â€ i said, lowering my voice, â€œthe reason i canâ€™t sell is that my fatherâ€™s still
alive.â€
â€œyes?â€ he said, perking up. â€œhe came back, he is here?â€
â€œnot exactly,â€ i said. â€œheâ€™s away right now, on a sort of trip; but perhaps he will
be here soon.â€ for all i could tell he might have been listening to us at that moment,
from behind the raspberry canes or the burn heap.
â€œhe went for the trees?â€ paul said, hurt that he hadnâ€™t been con

one at a time they were safer; i went down for the canoe.
â€œhi,â€ he said, â€œhow goes it?â€ he didnâ€™t know iâ€™d been watching. he had his shoes
off and was picking at a toenail as though nothing had happened.
david is like me, i thought, we are the ones that donâ€™t know how to love, there is
something essential missing in us, we were born that way, madame at the store with
one hand, atrophy of the heart. joe and anna are lucky, they do it badly and suffer
because of it: but itâ€™s better to see than to be blind, even though that way you had to
let in the crimes and atrocities too. or perhaps we are normal and the ones who can
love are freaks, they have an extra organ, like the vestigial eye in the foreheads of
amphibians theyâ€™ve never found the use for.
