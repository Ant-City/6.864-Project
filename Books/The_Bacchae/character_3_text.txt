round represents the front of the castle of_ pentheus, _king
    of thebes. at one side is visible the sacred tomb of semel√™, a
    little enclosure overgrown with wild vines, with a cleft in the
    rocky floor of it from which there issues at times steam or smoke.
    the god_ dionysus _is discovered alone_.

                  dionysus.

behold, god's son is come unto this land
of thebes, even i, dionysus, whom the brand
of heaven's hot splendour lit to life, when she
who bore me, cadmus' daughter semel√™,
died here. so, changed in shape from god to man,
i walk again by dirce's streams and scan
ismenus' shore. there by the castle side
i see her place, the tomb of the lightning's bride,
the wreck of smouldering chambers, and the great
faint wreaths of fire undying--as the hate
dies not, that hera held for semel√™.
  aye, cadmus hath done well; in purity
he keeps this place apart, inviolate,
his daughter's sanctuary; and i have set
my green and clustered vines to robe

d now i come to hellas--having taught
all the world else my dances and my rite
of mysteries, to show me in men's sight
manifest god.
                and first of hellene lands
i cry thus thebes to waken; set her hands
to clasp my wand, mine ivied javelin,
and round her shoulders hang my wild fawn-skin.
for they have scorned me whom it least beseemed,
semel√™'s sisters; mocked my birth, nor deemed
that dionysus sprang from dian seed.
my mother sinned, said they; and in her need,
with cadmus plotting, cloaked her human shame
with the dread name of zeus; for that the flame
from heaven consumed her, seeing she lied to god.
  thus must they vaunt; and therefore hath my rod
on them first fallen, and stung them forth wild-eyed
from empty chambers; the bare mountain side
is made their home, and all their hearts are flame.
yea, i have bound upon the necks of them
the harness of my rites. and with them all
the seed of womankind from hut and hall
of thebes, hath this my magic goad

ed out.
and there, with the old king's daughters, in a rout
confused, they make their dwelling-place between
the roofless rocks and shadowy pine trees green.
thus shall this thebes, how sore soe'er it smart,
learn and forget not, till she crave her part
in mine adoring; thus must i speak clear
to save my mother's fame, and crown me here
as true god, born by semel√™ to zeus.

  now cadmus yieldeth up his throne and use
of royal honour to his daughter's son
pentheus; who on my body hath begun
a war with god. he thrusteth me away
from due drink-offering, and, when men pray,
my name entreats not. therefore on his own
head and his people's shall my power be shown.
then to another land, when all things here
are well, must i fare onward, making clear
my godhead's might. but should this theban town
essay with wrath and battle to drag down
my maids, lo, in their path myself s

how toucheth this the part of dionyse
to hold maids pure perforce? in them it lies,
and their own hearts; and in the wildest rite
cometh no stain to her whose heart is white.
  nay, mark me! thou hast thy joy, when the gate
stands thronged, and pentheus' name is lifted great
and high by thebes in clamour; shall not he
rejoice in his due meed of majesty?
  howbeit, this cadmus whom thou scorn'st and i
will wear his crown, and tread his dances! aye,
our hairs are white, yet shall that dance be trod!
i will not lift mine arm to war with god

and up they sprang; but with bewildered eye,
agaze and listening, scarce yet hearing true.

their god's clear call, old cadmus' royal brood,
up, like wild pigeons startled in a wood,
on flying feet they came, his mother blind,
ag√¢v√™, and her sisters, and behind
all the wild crowd, more deeply maddened then,

notes on the bacchae

introductory note


the _bacchae_, being from one point of view a religious drama, a kind of
"mystery play," is full of allusions both to the myth and to the
religion of dionysus.

1. the myth, as implied by euripides. semel√™, daughter of cadmus, being
loved by zeus, asked her divine lover to appear to her once in his full
glory; he came, a blaze of miraculous lightning, in the ecstasy of which
semel√™ died, giving premature birth to a son. zeus, to save this child's
life and make him truly god as well as man, tore open his own flesh and
therein fostered the child till in due time, by a miraculous and
mysterious second birth, the child of semel√™ came to full life as god.

2. the religion of dionysus is hard to formulate or eve

the two births of dionysus, from semel√™ and from the body of zeus,
mentioning his mystic epiphanies as bull and as serpent. the next
strophe is an appeal to thebes, the birthplace or "nurse" of the god's
mother, semel√™; the antistrophe, an appeal to the cavern in crete, the
birthplace of zeus, the god's father, and the original home of the
mystic timbrel. the epode, or closing song, is full, not of doctrine,
but of the pure poetry of the worship.

pp. 86-95, ll. 170-369, teiresias and cadmus.]--teiresias seems to be
not a spokesman of the poet's own views--far from it--but a type of the
more cultured sort of dionysiac priest, not very enlightened, but ready
to abate some of the extreme dogmas of his creed if he may keep the
rest. cadmus, quite a different character, takes a very human and
earthly point of view: the god is probably a true god; but even if he is
false, there is no great harm done, and the worship will bring renown to
thebes and the royal family. it is notewort

hy how full of pity cadmus
is--the sympathetic kindliness of the sons of this world as contrasted
with the pitilessness of gods and their devotees. see especially the
last scenes of the play. even his final outburst of despair at not dying
like other men (p. 152), shows the same sympathetic humanity.

pp. 89 ff., ll. 215-262.--pentheus, though his case against the new
worship is so good, and he might so easily have been made into a fine
martyr, like hippolytus, is left harsh and unpleasant, and very close in

118). it is also
noteworthy, i think, that he is, as it were, out of tone with the other
characters. he belongs to a different atmosphere, like, to take a recent
instance, golaud in _pell√©as et m√©lisande_.

p. 91, l. 263, injurious king, &c.]--it is a mark of a certain yielding
to stage convention in euripides' later style, that he allows the chorus
leader to make remarks which are not "asides," but are yet not heard or
noticed by anybody.

p. 91, l. 264, sower of the giants' sod.]--cadmus, by divine guidance,
slew a dragon and sowed the teeth of it like seed in the "field of
ares." from the teeth rose a harvest of earth-born, or "giant" warriors,
of whom ech√Æon was one.

p. 92, l. 287, learn the truth of it, cleared from the false.]--this
timid essay in rationalism reminds one of similar efforts in pindar
(e.g. _ol._ i.). it is the product of a religious and unspeculative
mind, not feeling difficulties itself, but troubled by other people's
questions and objections. (s

p. 92, l. 292, the world-encircling fire.]--this fire, or ether, was the
ordinary material of which phantoms or apparitions were made.

pp. 93-95, ll. 330-369.--these three speeches are very clearly
contrasted. cadmus, thoroughly human, thinking of sympathy and
expediency, and vividly remembering the fate of his other grandson,
actaeon; pentheus, angry and "tyrannical"; teiresias speaking like a
christian priest of the middle ages, almost like tennyson's becket.

p. 95, l. 370.--the goddess [greek: hosia], "purity," seems to be one of
the many abstractions which were half personified by philosophy and by
orphism. it is possible that the word is really adjectival, "immaculate
one," and originally an e

ding, which, however, is incorrect in metre, and therefore cannot be
exactly what euripides wrote.

p. 134, l. 1036, and deem'st thou thebes so beggared.]--the couplet is
incomplete in the ms. but the sense needed is obvious.

p. 137, l. 1120, let it not befall through sin of mine, &c.]--this note
of unselfish feeling, of pity and humanity, becomes increasingly marked
in all the victims of dionysus towards the end of the play, and
contrasts the more vividly with the god's pitilessness. cadmus is always
gentle, and always thinking of the sufferings of others; and, indeed, so
is ag√¢v√™, after her return to reason, though with more resentment
against the oppressor.

pp. 139-143, ll. 1165-1200.--this marvellous scene defies comment. but i
may be excused for remarking (1) that the psychological change of the
chorus is, to my mind, proved by the words of the original, and does not
in the least depend on my interpolated stage directions; (2) the
extraordinary exultation of ag√¢v√

y a long chain of
events. the poet fixes on some portion of it--the action of one day,
generally speaking--and treats it as a piece of vivid concrete life, led
up to by a merely narrative introduction (the prologue), and melting
away into a merely narrative close. the method is to our taste
undramatic, but it is explicable enough. it falls in with the tendency
of greek art to finish, not with a climax, but with a lessening of
strain" (_greek literature_, p. 267).

the prophecy was that cadmus and harmonia should be changed into
serpents and should lead a host of barbarian invaders--identified with
an illyrian tribe, the encheleis--against hellas; they should prosper
until they laid hands on the treasures of delphi, and then be destroyed.
herodotus says that the persians were influenced by this prophecy when
they refrained from attacking delphi (hdt. ix. 42).
