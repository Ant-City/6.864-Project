the father. i say that to reverse the ordinary process may well be considered a madness: that is, to create credible situations, in order that they may appear true. but permit me to observe that if this be madness, it is the sole raison d'être of your profession, gentlemen.

the manager [getting up and looking at him]. so our profession seems to you one worthy of madmen then?

the father. was it my fault if that fellow carried you away? it happened quite suddenly; for after he had obtained some job or other, i could find no trace of them; and so, not unnaturally, my interest in them dwindled. but the drama culminated unforeseen and violent on their return, when i was impelled by my miserable flesh that still lives . . . ah! what misery, what wretchedness is that of the man who is alone and disdains debasing liaisons! not old enough to do without women, and not young enough to go and look for one without shame. misery? it's worse than misery; it's a horror; for no woman can any longer give him love; and when a man feels this . . . one ought to do without, you say? yes, yes. i know. each of us when he appears before his fellows is clothed in a certain dignity. but every man knows what unconfessable things pass within the secrecy of his own heart. one gives way to the temptation, only to rise from it again,

the manager. let's come to the point. this is only discussion.

the father. very good, sir! but a fact is like a sack which won't stand up when it is empty. in order that it may stand up, one has to put into it the reason and sentiment which have caused it to exist. i couldn't possibly know that after the death of that man, they had decided to return here, that they were in misery, and that she [pointing to the mother.] had gone to work as a modiste, and at a shop of the type of that of madame pace.

the step-daughter. absurd! how can i possibly be expected -- after that -- to be a modest young miss, a fit person to go with his confounded aspirations for "a solid moral sanity"?

the father. for the drama lies all in this -- in the conscience that i have, that each one of us has. we believe this conscience to be a single thing, but it is many-sided. there is one for this person, and another for that. diverse consciences. so we have this illusion of being one person for all, of having a personality that is unique in all our acts. but it isn't true. we perceive this when, tragically perhaps, in something w

the manager. maybe! on the other hand, you will understand -- we can't change scenes three or four times in one act.

the leading man. they used to once.

the manager. yes, when the public was up to the level of that child there.

the leading lady. it makes the illusion easier.

the father [irritated]. the illusion! for heaven's sake, don't say illusion. pl

as if anticipating her.] which you are accustomed to play here with your actors, and to ask you seriously once again: who are you?

the manager [astonished and irritated, turning to his actors]. if this fellow here hasn't got a nerve! a man who calls himself a character comes and asks me who i am!

the father [with dignity, but not offended]. a character, sir, may always ask a man who he is. because a character has really a life of his own, marked with his especial characteristics; for which reason he is always "somebody." but a man -- i'm not speaking of you now -- may very well be "nobody."

the manager. yes, but you are asking these questions of me, the boss, the manager! do you understand?

the father. but only in order to know if you, as you really are now, see yourself as you once were with all the illusions that were yours then, with all the things both inside and outside of you as they seemed to you -- as they were then indeed for you. well, sir, if you think of all those illusion

 just starting to rehearse it, when you arrived. [turning to the actors.] and this is what we've gained -- out of the frying-pan into the fire!

the father. i don't know to what author you may be alluding, but believe me i feel what i think; and i seem to be philosophizing only for those who do not think what they feel, because they blind themselves with their own sentiment. i know that for many people this self-blinding seems much more "human"; but the contrary is really true. for man never reasons so much and becomes so introspective as when he suffers; since he is anxious to get at the cause of his sufferings, to learn who has produced them, and whether it is just or unjust that he should have to bear them. on the other hand, when he is happy, he takes his happiness as it comes and doesn't analyze it, just as if happiness were his right. the animals suffer without reasoning about their sufferings. but take the case of a man who suffers and begins to reason about it. oh no! it can't be

allowed! let him suffer like an animal, and then -- ah yet, he is "human"!

the manager. look here! look here! you're off again, philosophizing worse than ever.

the father.. because i suffer, sir! i'm not philosophizing: i'm crying aloud the reason of my sufferings.

the manager [makes brusque movement as he is taken with a new idea]. i should like to know if anyone has ever heard of a character who gets right out of his part and perorates and speechifies as you do. have you ever heard of a case? i haven't.

the father. you have never met such a case, sir, because authors, as a rule, hide the labour of their creations. when the characters are really alive before their author, the latter does nothing but follow them in their action, in the

. it's true. i too have sought to tempt him, many, many times, when he has been sitting at his writing table, feeling a bit melancholy, at the twilight hour. he would sit in his armchair too lazy to switch on the light, and all the shadows that crept into his room were full of our presence coming to tempt him. [as if she saw herself still there by the writing table, and was annoyed by the presence of the actors.] oh, if you would only go away, go away and leave us alone -- mother here with that son of hers -- i with that child -- that boy there always alone -- and then i with him [just hints at the father.] -- and then i alone, alone . . . in those shadows! [makes a sudden movement as if in the vision she has of herself illuminating those shadows she wanted to seize hold of herself.] ah! my life! my life! oh, what scenes we proposed to him -- and i tempted him more than any of the others!

the father. maybe. but perhaps it was your fault that he refused to give us life: because you were t

oo insistent, too troublesome.

the step-daughter. . nonsense! didn't he make me so himself? [goes close to the manager to tell him. as if in confidence.] in my opinion he abandoned us in a fit of depression, of disgust for the ordinary theatre as the public knows it and likes it.

the son. exactly what it was, sir; exactly that!

the father. not at all! don't believe it for a minute. listen to me! you'll be doing quite right to modify, as you suggest, the excesses both of this girl here, who wants to do too much, and of this young man, who won't do anything at all.

the son. no, nothing!

the manager. you too get over the mark occasionally, my dear sir, if i may say so.

the father. i? when? where?

the manager. always! continuously! then there's this insistence of yours in tryi

e peace, you will be suppressing me: that's all. every true man, sir, who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants does not live for the sake of living, without knowing how to live; but he lives so as to give a meaning and a value of his own to life. for me this is everything. i cannot give up this, just to represent a mere fact as she [indicating the step-daughter.] wants. it's all very well for her, since her "vendetta" lies in the "fact." i'm not going to do it. it destroys my raison d'être.

the manager. your raison d'être! oh, we're going ahead fine! first she starts off, and then you jump in. at this rate, we'll never finish.

the father. now, don't be offended! have it your own way -- provided, however, that within the limits of the parts you assign us each one's sacrifice isn't too great.

the manager. you've got to understand that you can't go on arguing at your own pleasure. drama is action, sir, action and not confounded philosophy.

the father. all right. i'll do

 you a little! hide here . . . yes, like that. try and show your head just a little as if you were looking for someone . . . [goes back to observe the effect, when the boy at once goes through the action.] excellent! fine! [turning to step-daughter.] suppose the little girl there were to surprise him as he looks round,, and run over to him, so we could give him a word or two to say?

the step-daughter. it's useless to hope he will speak, as long as that fellow there is here . . . [indicates the son.] you must send him away first.

the son [jumping up]. delighted! delighted! i don't ask for anything better. [begins to move away.]

the manager [at once stopping him]. no! no! where are you going? wait a bit!

[the mother gets up alarmed and terrified at the thought that he is really about to go away. instinctively she lifts her arms to prevent him, without, however, leaving her seat.]

the son [to manager who stops him]. i've got nothing to do with this affair. let me go please! let me go!

the manager. what do you mean by saying you've got nothing to do with this?

the step-daughter [calmly, with irony]. don't bother to stop him: he won't go away.

the father. he has to act the terrible scene in the garden with his mother.

the son [suddenly resolute and with dignity]. i shall act nothing at all. i've said so from the very beginning. [to the manager.] let me go!

the step-daughter [going over to the manager]. allow me? [puts down the manager's arm which is restraining the son.] well, go away then, if you want to! [the son looks at her with contempt and hatred. she laughs and says.] you see, he can't, he can't go away! he is obliged to stay here, indissolubly bound to the chain. if i, who fly off when that happens which has to happen, because i can't bear him -- if i am still here and support that face and expression of his, you can well imagine that he is unable to move. he has to remain here, has to stop with that nice father of his, and that mother whose only son

[turning to manager to indicate her.] you see, she was getting up to keep him back. [to the mother, beckoning her with her hand.] come on! come on! [then to manager.] you can imagine how little she wants to show these actors of yours what she really feels; but so eager is she to get near him that . . . there, you see? she is willing to act her part. [and in fact, the mother approaches him; and as soon as the step-daughter has finished speaking, opens her arms to signify that she consents.]

the son [suddenly]. no! no! if i can't go away, then i'll stop here; but i repeat: i act nothing!

the father [to manager excitedly]. you can force him, sir.

the son. nobody can force me.

the father. i can.

the step-daughter. wait a minute, wait . . . first of all, the baby has to go to the fountain . . . [runs to take the child and leads her to the fountain.]

the manager. yes, yes of course; that's it. both at the same time.

the son [to manager]. what do you mean by both at the same time? it isn't right. there was no scene between me and her. [indicates the mother.] ask her how it was!

the mother. yes, it's true. i had come into his room . . .

the son. into my room, do you understand? nothing to do with the garden.

the manager. it doesn't matter. haven't i told you we've got to group the action?

the son [observing the juvenile lead studying him]. what do you want?

the juvenile lead. nothing! i was just looking at you.

the son [turning towards the second lady lead]. ah! she's at it too: to re-act her part! [indicating the mother.]

the manager. exactly! and it seems to me that you ought to be grateful to them for their interest.

 yes, but haven't you yet perceived that it isn't possible to live in front of a mirror which not only freezes us with the image of ourselves, but throws our likeness back at us with a horrible grimace?

the father. that is true, absolutely true. you must see that.

the manager [to second lady lead and juvenile lead]. he's right! move away from them!

the son. do as you like. i'm out of this!

the manager. be quiet, you, will you? and let me hear your mother! [to mother.] you were saying you had entered . . .

the mother. yes, into his room, because i couldn't stand it any longer. i went to empty my heart to him of all the anguish that tortures me . . . but as soon as he saw me come in . . .

the son. nothing happened! there was no scene. i went away, that's all! i don't care for scenes!

the mother. it's true, true. that's how it was.

the manager.

 well now, we've got to do this bit between you and him. it's indispensable.

the mother. i'm ready . . . when you are ready. if you could only find a chance for me to tell him what i feel here in my heart.

the father [going to son in a great rage]. you'll do this for your mother, for your mother, do you understand?

the son [quite determined]. i do nothing!

the father [taking hold of him and shaking him]. for god's sake, do as i tell you! don't you hear your mother asking you for a favor? haven't you even got the guts to be a son?

the son [taking hold of the father]. no! no! and for god's sake stop it, or else . . . [general agitation.]

the mother [pleading]. please! please!

the father [not leaving hold of the son]. you've got to obey, do you hear?

the son [a

the manager. man alive! you came here . .

the son [indicating father]. he did! i didn't!

the manager. arent't you here now?

the son. it was his wish, and he dragged us along with him. he's told you not only the things that did happen, but also things that have never happened at all.

the manager. well, tell me then what did happen. you went out of your room without saying a word?

the son. without a word, so as to avoid a scene!

the manager. and then what did you do?

the son. nothing . . . walking in the garden . . . [hesitates for a moment with expression of gloom.]

the manager [coming closer to him, interested by his e

the son. there in the fountain . . .

the father [pointing with tender pity to the mother]. she was following him at the moment . . .

the manager [to the son anxiously]. and then you . . .

the son. i ran over to her; i was jumping in to drag her out when i saw something that froze my blood . . . the boy standing stock still, with eyes like a madman's, watching his little drowned sister, in the fountain!

other actors. no, no, it's only make believe, it's only pretence!
