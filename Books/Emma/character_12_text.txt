mr. elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was repeating, â€œno husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you observe. exactly so. no husbands and wives,â€ with so interesting a consciousness, that emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once. but as she wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.
she had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. it was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like mr. john knightleyâ€™s, and was destined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.
the sitting began; and harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. but there was no doing any thing, with mr. elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch. she gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence; bu

mr. and mrs. john knightley, from having been longer than usual absent from surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest. till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their surry connexions, or seen at all by mr. woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as london, eve

mrs. john knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. she could never see a fault in any of them. she was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution; was d

mr. john knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. he was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be inc

â€œjust as it should be,â€ said mr. john knightley, â€œand just as i hoped it was from your letters. her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. i have been always telling you, my love, that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have emmaâ€™s account, i hope you will be satisfied.â€

mr. woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;â€”but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.

there could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs. john knightley, in this short visit to hartfield, going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister. she had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. it was a delightful visit;â€”perfect, in being much too short.

after a few minutes of entire silence between them, john knightley began withâ€”

emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. the preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least, which mr. john knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent.

she had not time to know how mr. elton took the reproof, so rapidly did another subject succeed; for mr. john knightley now came into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to mr. woodhouse:
â€œthis will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir. something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow.â€

isabella stept in after her father; john knightley, forgetting that he did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally; so that emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by mr. elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them, and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. it would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to him of harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have see

certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as harrietâ€™s friend.
to mr. john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject, for the first start of its possibility. there was no denying that those brothers had penetration. she remembered what mr. knightley had once said to her about mr. elton, the caution he had given, the conviction he had professed that mr. elton would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. it was dreadfully mortifying; but mr. elton was prov

k churchill sang again. they had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at weymouth. but the sight of mr. knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half emmaâ€™s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs. westonâ€™s suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions. her objections to mr. knightleyâ€™s marrying did not in the least subside. she could see nothing but evil in it. it would be a great disappointment to mr. john knightley; consequently to isabella. a real injury to the childrenâ€”a most mortifying change, and material loss to them all;â€”a very great deduction from her fatherâ€™s daily comfortâ€”and, as to herself, she could not at all endure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey. a mrs. knightley for them all to give way to!â€”noâ€”mr. knightley must never marry. little henry must remain the heir of donwell.
presently mr. knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. they talked at first only of the

she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very immaterial. she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother.
the event was more favourable to mr. woodhouse than to emma. john knightley came; but mr. weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day. he might be able to join them in the evening, but certainly not to dinner. mr. woodhouse was quite at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the chief of even emmaâ€™s vexation.
the day came, the party were punctually assembled, and mr. john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being

nture far, miss fairfax, this morning, or i am sure you must have been wet.â€”we scarcely got home in time. i hope you turned directly.â€
â€œi went only to the post-office,â€ said she, â€œand reached home before the rain was much. it is my daily errand. i always fetch the letters when i am here. it saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. a walk before breakfast does me good.â€
â€œnot a walk in the rain, i should imagine.â€
â€œno, but it did not absolutely rain when i set out.â€
mr. john knightley smiled, and replied,
â€œthat is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you; and henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before. the post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. when you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for.â€
there was a little blush, and then this answer,
â€œi must not hope to be ever situated as you are,

t that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters.â€
â€œindifferent! oh! noâ€”i never conceived you could become indifferent. letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very positive curse.â€
â€œyou are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of friendship.â€
â€œi have often thought them the worst of the two,â€ replied he coolly. â€œbusiness, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.â€
â€œah! you are not serious now. i know mr. john knightley too wellâ€”i am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. i can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation. you have every body dearest to you always at hand, i, probably, never shall again; and therefore till i have outlived all my affections, a post-office, i think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than

â€œwhen i talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,â€ said john knightley, â€œi meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings. i consider one as including the other. time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circleâ€”but that is not the change i had in view for you. as an old friend, you will allow me to hope, miss fairfax, that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have.â€
it was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. a pleasant â€œthank youâ€ seemed meant to laugh it off, b

â€œexcuse me,â€ said jane earnestly, â€œi cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. if the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when i am not here, by my grandmamaâ€™s.â€
â€œoh! my dear; but so much as patty has to do!â€”and it is a kindness to employ our men.â€
jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of answering, she began speaking again to mr. john knightley.
â€œthe post-office is a wonderful establishment!â€ said she.â€”â€œthe regularity and despatch of it! if one thinks of all that it has to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!â€
â€œit is certainly very well regulated.â€
â€œso seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! so seldom that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom, is even carried wrongâ€”and not one in a million, i suppose, actually lost! and when one considers the variet

â€œthe clerks grow expert from habit.â€”they must begin with some quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. if you want any farther explanation,â€ continued he, smiling, â€œthey are paid for it. that is the key to a great deal of capacity. the public pays and must be served well.â€
the varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual observations made.
â€œi have heard it asserted,â€ said john knightley, â€œthat the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master teaches, it is natural enough. but for that reason, i should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can get. isabella and emma, i think, do write very much alike. i have not always known their writing apart.â€
â€œyes,â€ said his brother hesitatingly, â€œthere is a likeness. i know what you mean

the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when mr. weston made his appearance among them. he had returned to a late dinner, and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over. he had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprizeâ€”but there was great joy. mr. woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been sorry to see him before. john knightley only was in mute astonishment.â€”that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london, should set off again, and walk half a mile to another manâ€™s house, for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. a man who had been in motion since eight oâ€™clock in the morning, and might now have been still, who had been long talking, and migh

t have been silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!â€”such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world!â€”could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party. john knightley looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said, â€œi could not have believed it even of him.â€
mr. weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the serv

as very well satisfied with what she did say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.
it was well that he took every bodyâ€™s joy for granted, or he might not have thought either mr. woodhouse or mr. knightley particularly delighted. they were the first entitled, after mrs. weston and emma, to be made happy;â€”from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley, that it would have been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to mrs. elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.

â€œi hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,â€ said mr. weston.
mrs. elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.

ing round, and mr. weston, having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.
after tea, mr. and mrs. weston, and mr. elton sat down with mr. woodhouse to cards. the remaining five were left to their own powers, and emma doubted their getting on very well; for mr. knightley seemed little disposed for conversation; mrs. elton was wanting notice, which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.
mr. john knightley proved more talkative than his brother. he was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began withâ€”
â€œwell, emma, i do not believe i have any thing more to say about the boys; but you have your sisterâ€™s letter, and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure. my charge would be much more concise than herâ€™s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that i have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic them.â€

â€œupon my word,â€ exclaimed emma, â€œyou amuse me! i should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party; and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys. these amazing engagements of mineâ€”what have they been? dining once with the colesâ€”and having a ball talked of, which never took place. i can understand youâ€”(nodding at mr. john knightley)â€”your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. but you, (turning to mr. knightley,) who know how very, very seldom i am ever two hours from hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, i cannot imagine. and as to my dear little boys, i must say, that if aunt emma has not time for them, i do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she i

 pretty little tunbridge-ware box, which harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the cotton, emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.
â€œnow,â€ said harriet, â€œyou must recollect.â€
â€œno, indeed i do not.â€
â€œdear me! i should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it!â€”it was but a very few days before i had my sore throatâ€”just before mr. and mrs. john knightley cameâ€”i think the very evening.â€”do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?â€”but, as you had none about you, and knew i had, you desired me to supply him; and so i took mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me. and so then, in my nonsense, i could not help making a treasure of itâ€”so i put it by never to be u

a something bordering on it in her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.â€”it might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.
she had no difficulty in procuring isabellaâ€™s invitation; and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting to invention.â€”there was a tooth amiss. harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist. mrs. john knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to herâ€”and though not so fond of a dentist as of a mr. wingfield, she was quite eager to have harriet under her care.â€”when it was thus settled on her sisterâ€™s side, emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.â€”harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in mr. woodhouseâ€™s carriage.â€”it was all arranged, it was all completed, and harriet was safe in bruns

which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appear to find harriet different from what she had known her before.â€”isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if harriet had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her. emmaâ€™s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by harrietâ€™s being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least. mr. and mrs. john knightley were to come down in august, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.
â€œjohn does not even mention your friend,â€ said mr. knightley. â€œhere is his answer, if you like to see it.â€
it was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned.

ry, and mrs. elton, immediately afterwards. it was no more than the principals were prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls, how soon it would be over highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.
in general, it was a very well approved match. some might think him, and others might think her, the most in luck. one set might recommend their all removing to donwell, and leaving hartfield for the john knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one habitation, the vicarage.â€”there, the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction. mr. elton cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped â€œthe young ladyâ€™s pride would now be contented;â€ and supposed â€œshe had always meant to catch knightley if she could;â€ and, on the point of living at hartfield, could daringly exclaim, â€œrat

ed one night of all her turkeysâ€”evidently by the ingenuity of man. other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.â€”pilfering was housebreaking to mr. woodhouseâ€™s fears.â€”he was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his son-in-lawâ€™s protection, would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life. the strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the mr. knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. while either of them protected him and his, hartfield was safe.â€”but mr. john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november.
the result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-dayâ€”and mr. elton was called on, within a month from the marriage of mr. and mrs. robert martin, to join the hands of mr. knightley and miss woodhouse.
the wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no taste for finery or parade;
