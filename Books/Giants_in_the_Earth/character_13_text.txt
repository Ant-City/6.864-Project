ly all the while, humming a quiet melody to herself. when sörine addressed her directly she stopped singing and answered that it made little difference to her, if--she choked, and went on--if it was right for a person to take a name other than the one given in baptism. . . . but it made no difference to her. sörine grew serious over this point. "i agree with you, beret. . . . but here in this country we can't bear our fathers' names, anyway. it wouldn't do for me to sign my name as sörine sakkarias'-daughter!"

"no," cried tönseten, excitedly, "not if you want to be hans olsa's wife!" . . . remarkable what a bright head sat on sörrina's shoulders!

this matter of names brought on a long discussion. hans olsa, like the others, decided that his wife had made a practical suggestion; per hansa found little to say, but his face had a look of quiet elation. . . . he must speak to beret about this, alone and right away! . . . he sat there trying the name over in his mind, first on her, then

we sift the people as they pass through here--keep our own, and let the others go!" . . . per hansa wanted to run on, for he felt in high spirits; but he checked himself, observing that the man looked as if he stood on the very brink of the grave.

--was there any chance of putting up here for the night?

"certainly! certainly!" cried per hansa, briskly, "provided you are willing to take things as they are."

the man didn't answer, but walked instead to the wagon and spoke to some one inside:

"kari, now you must brace up and come down. here we have found norwegians at last!" as if fearing a contradiction, he added: "ya, they are real norwegians. i've talked with them."

on top of his words there came out of the wagon, first a puny boy with a hungry face, somewhat smaller than the other boy; then a girl of about the same size, but looking much older. she helped to get down another boy, about six years old, who evidently had been sleeping and looked cross and tired. that seemed to be all.

the man stepped closer to the wagon. "aren't you coming, kari?"

a groan sounded within the canvas. the girl grabbed hold of her father's arm. "you must untie the rope! can't you remember anything?" she whispered, angrily.

"ya, that's right! wait a minute till i come and help you."

an irresistible curiosity took hold of per hansa; in two jumps he stood on the tongue of the wagon. the sight that met his eyes sent chills running down his spine. inside sat a woman on a pile of clothes, with her back against a large immigrant chest; around her wrists and le

ading to the handles of the chest a strong rope was tied; her face was drawn and unnatural. per hansa trembled so violently that he had to catch hold of the wagon box, but inwardly he was swearing a steady stream. to him it looked as if the woman was crucified.

. . . "for god's sake, man!" . . .

the stranger paid no attention; he was pottering about and pleading: "come down now, kari. . . . ya, all right, i'll help you! everything's going to be all right--i know it will! . . . can you manage to get up?" he had untied the rope, and the woman had risen to her knees.

"o god!" she sighed, putting her hands to her head.

"please come. that's right; i'll help you!" pleaded the man, as if he were trying to persuade a child.

she came down unsteadily. "is this the place, jakob?" she asked in a bewildered way. but now beret ran up and put her arm around her; the women looked into e

ely. "you must be a seafaring man, to have tried that trick!"

"no, i'm no sailor. but fisher-folk out here have told me that it's possible to steer by a rope. . . . i had to try something."

"where did you cross the sioux?"

"how do i know where i crossed it? we came to a river a long way to the east of here--that must have been the sioux. we hunted and hunted before we could find a place shallow enough to cross. . . . god! this has certainly been a wandering in the desert for me! . . . but if kari only gets better, i won't complain--though i never dreamed that life could be so hard." . . .

"is she--is she sick, that woman of yours?"

the man did not answer this question immediately; he wiped his face with the sleeve of his shirt. when he spoke again, his voice had grown even more blurred and indistinct: "physically she seems to be as well as ever--as far as i can see. she certainly hasn't overworked since we've been travelling. i hope there's nothing wrong with her. . . . but certain th

ld saying, and a true one, too, i guess. . . . before long we saw that the boy wasn't going to recover. so we hurried on, day and night, trying to catch our neighbours. . . . well, that's about all of it. one night he was gone--just as if you had blown out a candle. ya, let me see--that was five nights ago."

"have you got him there in the wagon?" demanded per hansa, grabbing the man by the arm.

"no, no," he muttered, huskily. "we buried him out there by a big stone--no coffin or anything. but kari took the best skirt she had and wrapped it all around him--we had to do something, you know. . . . but," he continued, suddenly straightening up, "paul cannot lie there! as soon as i find my neighbours, i'll go and get him. otherwise kari . . ." the man paused between the sobs that threatened to choke him. "i have had to tie her up the last few days. she insisted on getting out and going back to paul. i don't think she has had a wink of sleep for over a week. . . . it's just as i was saying--so

me people can't stand things." . . .

per hansa leaned heavily against the wagon. "has she gone crazy?" he asked, hoarsely.

"she isn't much worse than the rest of us. i don't believe . . . kari is really a well-balanced woman . . . but you can imagine how it feels, to leave a child that way . . ."

the boy, john, had finished milking. he had put the rail down and was standing a little way off, listening to his father's story; suddenly he threw himself on the ground, sobbing as if in convulsions.

"john! john!" admonished the father. "aren't you ashamed of yourself--a grown-up man like you! take the milk and carry it into the house!"

"that's right!" echoed per hansa, pulling himself t

e, and did what anyone told her. a short while before noon that day she took a notion that she must change her clothes; she got up from what she was doing, washed, and went to the wagon. when she came back she had dressed herself in her best; in a way she looked all right, but made a bizarre appearance because she had put so much on. . . . the man seemed fairly cheerful as they started; he talked a good deal, heaping many blessings upon per hansa. . . . if he could only find his neighbours, and kari could only forget, things would be all right in a little while. ya, it was a hard life, but--well, god's blessings on per hansa, and many thanks! and now he must be off! . . . his voice was just as husky and blurred as when he came.

the wagon started creaking; the man, short and stooping, led the way; the family piled into the wagon; the two cows jogged behind. . . . they laid their course due west. . . . banks of heavy cloud were rolled up on the western horizon--huge, fantastic forms that se

e little group directly before him; not that he actually pointed to the sunburnt, healthy woman who sat there watching the fly, too busy to listen to him; but he commenced to speak of the love of mother and child. and all at once he did something that he had never done before in a communion sermon--he told a story; it was a sentimental story, too--and he had always despised sentimentality in preaching:

once upon a time, he said, a norwegian immigrant woman landed in new york city; her name was kari--she was widowed and had nine children. . . . new york is a terribly large city. imagine the difficulties a poor immigrant woman meets with there--one who can neither speak nor understand the language! and this woman hadn't a single friend in all america. when she landed, and saw the great throngs of people, and looked at the whirlpool of traffic, she got terribly frightened, poor soul! she had been told that in this foreign metropolis almost anything might happen to a mother coming alone with

nine children; and so she had prepared herself in her own way. around her waist was wound a long rope; this she now unrolled, tying all nine children to it in single file, but keeping the end still securely fastened around her waist. in this fashion kari plodded through the streets of the great city, a laughingstock to all passers-by. but just the same, she reached her destination at last, with all her nine children safe and sound! . . . wasn't that rope a fine illustration of a mother's love?

it occurred to the minister that he had come down to very commonplace things--yet he spoke straight out, from the fullness of his heart. . . . the people were listening intently; the woman with three little children stopped chasing the fly; he longed to
