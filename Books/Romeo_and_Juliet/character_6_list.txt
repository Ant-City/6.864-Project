Capulet - 
                The
patriarch of the Capulet family, father of Juliet, husband of Lady
Capulet, and enemy, for unexplained reasons, of Montague. He truly
loves his daughter, though he is not well acquainted with Juliet's
thoughts or feelings, and seems to think that what is best for her is
a "good" match with Paris. Often prudent, he commands respect and
propriety, but he is liable to fly into a rage when either is lacking.
