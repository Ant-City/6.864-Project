our father, oedipus, bequeathed to us!

yes, for our brothers' fate. creon has given 

an honored burial to one, to the other 

only unburied shame. eteocles 

is laid in the earth with all the rites observed 

that give him his due honor with the dead. 

but the decree concerning polyneices 

published through thebes is that his wretched body 

shall lie unmourned, unwept, unsepulchered.

the wretched ending of a wretched life.

so on his head dashes the deepening tide 

of life-long sorrow, so the great winds blow 
from earliest dawn to sunset, from the bright 
and blazing midday to the dead of night: 1190 

unceasing bitterness, unceasing woe.
