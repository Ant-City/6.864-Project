in  the  kitchen  may  and  rosaleen  were  working 
on pancake batter. i didn't like pancakes that much, but i 
didn't  say  so.  i  was  just  thankful  it  wasn't  grits.  after  
kneeling  on  them  half  your  life,  you  don't  care  to  eat  
them. 

the trash can  was  full of  banana peels,  and the 
electric percolator bubbled into the tiny glass nozzle on 
top of it. bloop, bloop. i loved the way  it sounded, the 
way it smelled. 

"who's the man out there?" i asked. 
"that's neil," said may. "he's sweet on june." 
"it looks to me like june is  sweet on him, too." 

"yeah, but she won't say so," said may. 

"she's kept that poor man strung along for years. 

won't marry him and won't let him go." 

may drizzled batter on the griddle in the shape of 

a big l. 

"this one's yours," she said. l for lily. 
rosaleen set the table and warmed the honey in 
a bowl of hot water. i poured orange juice into the jelly 
glasses. 

"how  come  june  won't  get  married  to  him?"  i

t be unfortunate enough to send may into one 
of  her  episodes,  but  she  was  intent  on  my  pancake.  it 
struck me for the first time how odd it was that none of 
them  were  married.  three  unmarried  sisters 
living 
together  like  this.  i  heard  rosaleen  make  a  sound  like 
hmmrnph, and i knew she was thinking about her own 
sorry  husband,  wishing  he  hadn't  shown  up  for  their 
ceremony. 

"june  swore  off  men  and  said  she  would  never 
get married, and then she met neil when he came to be 
the  new  principal  at  her  school.  i  don't  know  what 
happened  to  his  wife,  but he  didn't  have  one  anymore 
after  he  moved  here.  he  has  tried  every  which  way  to  
get  june  to  marry  him,  but  she  won't  do  it.  me  and  
august can't convince her either." 

a wheeze welled up from may's chest, and then 

out came "oh! susanna." here we go. 

"lord, not again," said rosaleen. 
"i'm sorry," may said. "i just can't help it." 
"why don't you go out

 to the wall?" i said, prying 

the spatula out of her hand. "it's okay." 

"yeah,"  rosaleen  told  her.  "you  do  what  you 
gotta do." we watched from the screen door as may cut 
past june and neil. 

 

152 

a  few  minutes  later  june  came  in  with  neil  
behind  her.  i  worried  that  his  head  wouldn't  clear  the 
door. 

"what  started  may  off?"  june wanted  to  know. 
her  eyes  followed  a  roach  that  darted  beneath  the 
refrigerator. "you didn't step on a roach in front of her, 
did you?" 

"no," i said. "we didn't even see a roach." 
she opened the cabinet under the sink  and dug 
into  the  back  for  a  pump  can  of  bug  killer.  i  thought 
about explaining to her my mother's ingenious method 
of  ridding  the  house  of

 roaches—cracker  crumbs  and 
marshmallow—but then i thought, this is june, forget it. 

"well, what upset her, then?" june asked. 
i hated to come out and say it with neil standing 
right there, but rosaleen didn't have any problem with 
it. 

"she's upset you won't marry neil." 
i  had  never  considered  until  then  that  colored 
people  could blush, or  maybe it  was anger that  turned 
june's face and ears such a dark plum color. 

neil  laughed.  "see  there.  you  should  marry  me 

and quit upsetting your sister." 

"oh,  get  out of  here,"  she  said,  and gave him a 

push. 

 

153 

"you promised me pancakes, and i'm gonna have 
them,"  he  said.  he  wore  blue  jeans  and  an  undershirt 
with  grease  smears  on  it,  along  with  horn-rimmed 
glasses. he looked like a very studious mechanic. 

he smiled at me and then rosaleen. "so are you 

gonna introduce me or keep me in the dark?" 

i  have  noticed  that  if

 i  said,  having  to  pause 

and remember what i'd said earlier. 

"and you?" he said to rosaleen. 

 

154 

she stared at the copper jell-o molds that hung 
on either side of the window over the sink. "same place 
as lily." 

"what's that burning?" said june. 
smoke  poured  off  the  griddle.  the  l-shaped 
pancake had burned to a crisp. june yanked the spatula 
from  my  fingers,  scraped  up  the  mess,  and  dropped  it 
into the trash. 

"how  long  are  you  planning  on  staying?"  neil 

asked. 

june stared at me. waiting. her lips pinched tight 

along her teeth. 

"a  while  longer,"  i  answered,  looking  over  into 

the garbage c. l for lily. 

i could feel the questions gathering in him, knew 

i could not face them. 

"i'm not hungry," i said, and walked out the back 

door. 

crossing the back porch, i heard rosaleen say to 

him, "have you registered yourself to vote?"

on  sunday  i  thought  they  would  go  to  church, 
but no, they held a special

ck. 

that  night,  when  the  darkness  was  weighed 
down  with  singing  crickets  and  rosaleen  was  snoring 
right along with them, i had myself a good cry. i couldn't 
even say why. just everything, i guess. because i hated 
lying to august when she was so  good to me. because 
rosaleen  was  probably  right  about  dream  worlds. 
because i was pretty sure the virgin mary was not back

there  on  the  peach  farm  standing  in  for  me  the  way 
she'd stood in for beatrix. 

neil came over most evenings and sat with june 
in  the parlor while  the rest of  us watched  the  fugitive 
on  television  in  the  den.  august  said  she  wished  the 
fugitive  would  go  ahead  and  find  the  one-armed  man 
and get it over with. 

during commercials i pretended to go for water 
and instead crept down the hall, where i tried to make 
out what june and neil were saying. 

"i'd like you to tell me why not," i heard neil say 

one evening. 

and june, "because i can't." 
"that'

s not a reason." 
"well, it's the only one i've got." 
"look, i'm not gonna wait around forever," neil 

said. 

i  was  anticipating  what june  would  say  to  that, 
when neil came through the door without warning and 
caught  me  pressed  against  the  wall  listening  to  their 
most  private  sayings.  he  looked  for  a  second  like  he 
might  turn  me  over  to  june,  but  he  left,  banging  the 
front door behind him. 

i hightailed it back  to  the den,  but not  before i 

heard the beginnings of a sob in june's throat.

out in the county to bring in the last of the supers to be

n, but boy, was i wrong. 

"it's  about  a  girl  whose  mother  died  when  she 

was little," she said. 

then  she  looked  at  me  in  a  way  that  made  my  
stomach  tip  over,  the  same  way  it'd  tipped  over  when  
she'd told me about beatrix. 

"what  happens  to  the  girl?"  i  asked,  trying  to  

make my voice steady. 

"i've only started the book," she said. "but right 

now she's just feeling lost and sad." 

i  turned  and  looked  out  toward  the  garden, 
where june and neil were picking tomatoes. i stared at 
them while  the  crank on the  washer  squeaked.  i could 
hear the clothes falling into the basin behind the rollers. 
she knows, were thought. she knows who i am. 

i stretched out my arms like i was pushing back 
invisible walls of air and, looking down, caught sight of 
my  shadow  on  the  floor,  this  skinny  girl  with  wild  hair 
curling up in the humidity, with her arms flung out and 
her palms erect like she was trying to stop traffic in both

nd down and kiss her, for how 
small and determined she looked. 

when  i  glanced  back  at  august,  she  was  still  

staring at me, like she expected me to say something. 

"well,  i guess  i'll  go  see  rosaleen's  new  bed," i 

said. 

august  picked  up  her  book,  and  that  was  that. 
the  moment  passed,  and  so  did  the  feeling  that  she 
knew who i was. i mean, it didn't make sense: how could 
august boatwright know anything about me? 

it was around this time that june and neil started 
a  first-class  fight  out  there  in  the  tomato  garden.  june 
shouted something, and he shouted back. 

"uh-oh,"  said  august.  she  put  down  the  book 

and stood up. 

"why can't you just let it be?" yelled june. 
"why does it always come back to this? get this 
i'm  not  getting  married.  not 

through  your  head: 
yesterday, not today, not next year!" 

"what are you scared of?" neil said. 
"for  your 

information, 

i'm  not  scared  of 

anything." 

"well, then, you'r

e  the most  selfish  bitch i  ever 

met," he said, and started walking toward his car. 
"oh, lord," said august under her breath. 

 

192 

"how  dare  you  call  me  that!"  said  june.  "you 
come back here. don't you walk off when i'm talking to 
you!" 

neil  kept  right  on  walking,  didn't  look  over  his 
shoulder  once.  zach,  i  noticed,  had  stopped  loading 
supers  onto  the  hand  truck  and  watched,  shaking  his 
head like he couldn't believe he was witnessing another 
scene where people's worst sides come out. 

"if  you  leave  now,  don't  plan  on  coming  back!" 

she yelled. 

neil  climbed  into  his  car,  and  suddenly  june 
came  running  with  tomatoes  in  her  hands.  she  reared 
back and threw one, splat! right into

the windshield. the 
second one landed on the door handle. 

"don't you come back!" she yelled as neil drove 

off. trailing tomato juice. 

may  sank  down  onto  the  floor,  crying  and 
looking so hurt inside i could almost see soft, red places 
up under her rib bones. august and i walked her out to 
her  wall,  and  for  the  umpteenth  time  she  wrote  june 
and neil on a scrap of paper and wedged it between the 
rocks. 

we  spent  the  rest  of  the  day  working  on  the 
supers  that  zach  and i  had  hauled  in.  stacked  six  high, 
they  made  a  miniature  skyline  all  through  the  honey 
house. august said it looked like bee city in there. 

 

193 

we ran twelve extractor loads through the whole 
system—all  the  way  from  the  uncapping  knife  to  the 
bottling tank. august didn't like her honey to sit around 
waiting  too  long,  becaus

had in the dream, turning up six-legged and ugly. 

i wanted to march up to august and ask why my 
mother had been here, but fear stopped me. i wanted to 
know,  and  i  didn't  want  to  know.  i  was  all  hung  up  in 
limbo. 

late  friday  afternoon,  after  we  had  finished 
cleaning  the  last  of  the  supers  and  storing  them  away,  

 

254 

zach  went  out  to  take  a  look  under  the  hood  of  the  
honey wagon. it was still acting funny and overheating, 
in spite of neil having worked on it. 

i wandered back to my room and sat on my cot. 
heat radiated from the window. i considered getting up 
to turn on the fan but only sat there staring through the 
panes  at  the  milky-blue  sky,  a  sad,  ragged  feeling 
catching hold inside. i could hear music coming from the 
truck  radio,  sam  cooke  singing  "another  saturday 
night,"  then  may  calling  across  the  yard  to  rosaleen, 
something about  getting the sheets off  the clothesline. 
and i was struck a

at midnight. 

after  the  shock  wore  off  some,  i  tried  to  think 
what to do, how to get home. zach had taken the keys, 
or  i might've  tried driving  myself,  even though  i  didn't 
know gears from brakes. there wasn't a store open now 
to ask to use a phone, and when i spotted a pay phone 
down the street, i realized i didn't have a dime. i got out 
of the truck and walked. 

• • • 
when i got to the pink house a half hour later, i 
saw  august,  june,  rosaleen,  neil,  and  clayton  forrest 
gathered in the long shadows near the hydrangeas. the 

 

260 

murmur of their voices floated up into the dying light. i 
heard  zach's  name.  i  heard  mr.  forrest  say  the  word 
"jail."  i  guessed  that  zach  had  called  him  with  his  one 
phone call, and here he was, breaking the news. 

neil  stood  next  to  june,  which  told  me  they 
hadn't  really  meant  all  that  don't  you  come  back  and 
you  selfish  bitch  that  they'd  hurled  at  each  o

of tea and set a plate of pimiento-cheese sandwiches on 
the table, as if anybody could eat. 

rosaleen's hair was done up in perfect cornrow 
plaits,  which  i  guessed  may  had  done  for  her  after  
supper. 

"now, what about bail?" august said. 
clayton cleared his throat. "judge monroe is out 
of  town  on  vacation,  so  nobody  is  getting  out  before 
next wednesday, it looks like." 

neil  stood  up  and  walked  over  to  the  window. 
his hair was cut in a neat square at the back. i tried to 
concentrate  on  it  to  keep  from  breaking  down.  next 
wednesday was five days from now. five days. 

"well,  is  he  all  right?"  asked  june.  "he  wasn't 

hurt, was he?" 

"they  only  let  me  see  him  for  a  minute,"  said  

clayton. "but he seemed all right." 

outside, the night sky was moving over us. i was 
aware  of  it,  aware  of  the  way  clayton  had  said  he

e  in  sylvan.  it  was  concrete-block  gray,  with  metal  
windows and poor lighting. i told myself it was an act of 
stupidity to go inside. i was a fugitive from justice, and 
here  i  was  breezing  into  a  jail  where  there  were 
probably policemen trained to recognize me. but august 
had  asked  if  i  wanted  to  come  with  her  to  visit  zach.  
how was i going to say anything but yes to that? 

 

264 

the  policeman  inside  had  a  crew  cut  and  was 
very tall, taller than neil, and neil was wilt chamberlain 
size. he didn't seem especially glad to see us. "are you 
his mother?" he asked august. 

i looked at his name tag. eddie hazelwurst. 
"i'm  his  godmother,"  august  said,  standing  very 
erect,  like  she  was  having  her  height  measured.  "and 
this is a friend of the family." 

his  eyes  passed  over  me.  the  only  thing  he  
seemed suspicious about was how a girl as white as me 
could  be  a  friend  of  the  family.  he  picked  up  a  brown

"august, what?" 
when august turned back, her jaw was set. "i'm 
going to say something to you, june." she walked over 
and  stood  in  front  of  her.  "you've  been  halfway  living 
your life for too long. may was saying that when it's time 

 

304 

to die, go ahead and die, and when it's time to live, live. 
don't  sort-of-maybe  live,  but  live  like  you're  going  all 
out, like you're not afraid." 

"i  don't  know  what  you're  talking  about,"  june 

said. 

"i'm saying marry neil." 
"what?" 
"ever  since  melvin  edwards  backed  out  of  your 
wedding all those years back, you've been afraid of love, 
refusing to take a chance. like may said, it's your time to 
live. don't mess it up." 

june's mouth sat open in a wide circle, and not a 

word crossed her lips. 

suddenly  the  air  was  coated  with  the  smell  of  
burning.  rosaleen flung open the oven  and yanked out 
the pie to find every last meringue tip scorched. 

"we'll eat it like that," said august. "a lit

every day for four days straight we kept the vigil. 
august  had  may's  note  with  her  at  all  times,  tucked  in  
her pocket or slipped under her belt if she had on a no-
pocket dress.  i watched june, how she seemed quieter 
since august had lowered the boom on her about neil. 
not  exactly  sulking.  contemplating  is  more  like  it.  i 
would  catch  her  sitting  beside  the  coffin  leaning  her

forehead  against  it,  and  you  could  tell  she  was  doing 
more  than  saying  good-bye  to  may.  she  was  trying  to 
find her own answers to things. 

one afternoon august  and zach and  i went  out 
to the hives and took off the black cloths. august said we 
couldn't  leave  them  on  too  long,  since  the  bees  had 
memorized everything about th

eir hive and a change like 
that could make them disoriented. they might not find 
their way home again, she said. 

tell me about it, i thought. 
the daughters of mary showed up each day just 
before lunch and sat in the parlor with may through the 
afternoon, telling stories about her. we cried a good bit 
also,  but  i  could  tell  we  were  starting  to  feel  better 
about saying good-bye. i only hoped may was feeling all 
right about it, too. 

neil  stayed  at  the  house  nearly  as  much  as  the  
daughters, and seemed downright confused by the way 
june stared into his face. she could barely play the cello, 
because  it  meant  turning  loose of  his  hand. to  tell  the 
truth, the rest of us spent nearly as much time watching 
june and neil as we did seeing may into the next life. 

on the afternoon that the funeral home came to 
pick  up  may  for  the  burial,  bees  buzzed  around  the 
front-window screens. as the coffin was loa

and drove us down there, rosaleen and i would have to

get  jobs  somewhere,  rent  a  place  to  stay,  and  hope  
nobody asked any questions. 

sometimes  i  didn't  even  feel  like  getting  out  of  
bed. i took to wearing my days-of-the-week panties out 
of order. it could be monday and i'd have on underwear 
saying thursday. i just didn't care. 

the  only  time  i  saw  june  was  when  neil  came  
over, which was  every single  day.  she would  come  out 
wearing  hoop  earrings,  and  off  they'd  go,  taking  long 
rides in his car, which, she said, did her a world of good. 
the wind rearranged her thoughts, and the countryside 
made her see all the life still left out there waiting to be 
lived. neil would get behind the wheel, and june would 
slide over on the front seat so she was practically under 
the wheel with him. honestly, i worried for their safety.

 for four, using the sunday-
china plates with pink flowers and lacy scallops around 
the  edge.  i  broke  out  with  happiness  because  life 
seemed headed back to normal. 

rosaleen put a beeswax candle on the table, and 
i believe that was the first candle-lit meal of my entire 
life.  here  was  the  menu:  smothered  chicken,  rice  and 
gravy,  butter  beans,  sliced  tomatoes,  biscuits,  and 
candlelight. 

we had barely started in when rosaleen said to 

june, "so are you gonna marry neil or not?" 

august and i both stopped chewing and sat up. 
"that's for me to know and you to find out," june 

answered. 

"and  how  are  we  supposed  to  find  out,  if  you 

won't tell us?" said rosaleen. 

when  we'd  finished  the  food,  august  produced 
four bottles of ice-cold coca-cola from the refrigerator, 
along  with  four  little  packages  of  salted  peanuts.  we  
watched her pop the tops off the cokes. 

"what the heck is this?" said june.

because  you've  got  to  make  streamers  and  garlands,

wash the wagon, and get out the chains." 

i was thinking, whoa, back up. wash the wagon? 
hang christmas lights? get out the chains? the chains? 
the  knock  on  the  back  door  came  as  i  was  putting  my  
bowl in the sink. "if this isn't the best-smelling house in 
tiburon,  i'll  be  a  monkey's  uncle,"  said  neil,  stepping 
inside. 

"well,  i  guess  you're  saved  from  that  special 

relationship then," june said. 

she offered him a honey cake, but he shook his 
head,  which  was  a  dead  giveaway  right  there  that  he 
had  something  on  his  mind.  neil  did  not  refuse  food. 
ever. he stood in the middle of the floor, shuffling from 
one foot to the other. 

"what are you doing here?" june asked. 
he cleared his throat, rubbed his sideburns. "i—i 

came over here hoping for a word with

you." 

this  sounded  so  stiff  coming  out  of  his  mouth 
that june narrowed her eyes and studied him a second. 
"are you all right?" 

"i'm fine." he put his hands in his pockets. took 

them out. "i just want a word with you."

she stood there waiting. "well, i'm listening," she 

said. 

"i thought we could take a drive." 
she  looked  around  the  kitchen.  "if  you  haven't 

noticed, i'm up to my ears in work, neil." 

"i can see that, but—" 
"look, just tell me what it is," june said, starting 
to  get  into  one  of  her  huffs.  "what  is  so  all-fired 
important?" 

i  glanced  at  august,  who  had  her  lips  screwed 
over  to  the  side,  trying  to  look  busy.  rosaleen,  on  the  
other  hand,  had  stopped  all  semblance  of  work  and 
looked from june to neil. back to june. 

"hell," he said, "i came over here planning to ask 

you, for the hundredth time, to marry me."

the  house  creaked,  like  old  houses  do.  neil 
glanced at the door. i felt my shirt dampen all under my 
arms.  i  had  the  sensation  i  used  to  get  in  fifth  grade  
when the teacher would write some nonsense word on 
the  blackboard, 
like  "pnteahel,"  and  we  had  two 
minutes to unscramble it and find the word "elephant" 
before she dinged her bell. i used to break out in a sweat

rosaleen said, "well, don't just stand there with 

your mouth open, june. say something." 

june stared at neil, and i could see the struggle 
in her face. the surrender she had to  make inside. not 
just to neil but to life. 

finally  she  let  out  a  long,  sighing  breath.  "all 

right," she said. "let's get married." 

rosaleen slapped her thigh and burst out with a 
whoop,  while  august  broke  into  the  biggest  smile  i 
believe i'd ever seen on her face. me, i just looked from 
one person to another, trying to take it in. 

neil  walked  over  and  kissed  june  right  on  the 
mouth.  i didn't think  they were  ever  going to come up 
for air.

over what had just happened. 

we  had  all  these  chores  facing  us,  but  some 
things you have to sit and mull over before you can go 
on.  we  said,  "did  you  see  the  look  on  neil's  face?"… 
"can  you  believe  that  kiss?"  mostly  we  just  stared  at 
each other, saying "june's getting married!" 

getting  ready  for  mary  day  was  nonstop  work. 
first  august  got  me  started  on  the  streamers.  i  cut  
packages of thick blue-and white crepe paper into strips 
till i had rubbed blisters on both thumbs. i formed little 
twists in the edges with my fingers to give them a curled 
effect,  then  dragged  the  stepladder  into  the  yard  and 
hung them from the

where the cabbage weeds had grown. 

up  on  the  back  porch  august  cranked  the  ice 
cream churn. beside her feet sat a coil of chains. i stared 
at it. "what's that for?" 

"you'll see," she said.

at  6:00  p.m.  i  was  exhausted  from  mary  day  
goings-on,  and  the  real  part  hadn't  even  started.  i  got 
the  last  thing  on  my  list  done  and  was  headed  to  the 
honey house to get dressed, when june and neil pulled 
into the driveway. 

june  waltzed  up  with  her  hand  stuck  out  so  i 
could admire her ring. i looked it over, and i have to say 
neil had outdone himself. it wasn't that big, really, it was

august.  the  thought  set  off  a  nervous  quiver  through 
me.  i  sat  down  on  the  cot  and  felt  things  building 
inside—pushing against my chest. 

heading  back  to  the  pink  house,  wearing  clean 
shorts  and  a  top,  my  hair  all  combed,  i  stopped  to  
behold  everything.  august,  june,  rosaleen,  zach,  neil, 
otis, and all the daughters of mary stood around on the 
mowed grass beside the card tables, their laughter low 
and  vibrating.  piles  of  food.  blue-and-white  streamers 
rippling  in  the  breezes.  the  christmas  lights  glowed  in 
spirals  of  color  around  the  porch,  and  all  the  candles

queen of heaven," august said. 

she took one of them in her hand and, pinching 
off a  piece, held it before  mabelee, who stood next to 
her  in  the  circle.  august  said,  "this  is  the  body  of  the  
blessed mother." mabelee closed her eyes and opened 
her mouth, and august laid the cake on her tongue. 

after mabelee had swallowed, she did the same 
thing august had done—snipped off a piece and gave it 
to  the  next  person  in  the  circle,  who  happened  to  be 
neil.  mabdee,  who  could  not  have  measured  five  feet 
tall in spike heels, practically needed a stepladder to get 
up to his mouth. neil crouched down and opened wide. 
"this is the body of the mother," mabelee said, 
and popped it in. i did not know one thing, really, about 
the catholic  church,  but somehow  i felt  sure the  pope 
would  have  keeled  over  if  he'd  seen  this.  not  brother 
gerald, though. he wouldn't have wasted time fainting, 
just gotten busy arranging the exorcism.

when  you  first  got  here"—and  then  the  sweetness  of 
honey cake spread through my mouth. 

i wished it could have been zach standing next to 
me so i could lay the cake on his tongue. i would have 
said, i hope this softens you toward the world. i hope it 
brings  you  a  tender  feeling.  instead  i  got  to  give  the  
pinch of cake to cressie, who ate it with her eyes closed.

after we were all fed, zach and neil went to the 
parlor  and  returned  carrying  our  lady  of  chains.  otis 
followed  after  them,  lugging  the  pile  of  chain.  they 
stood her upright in the red wagon. august leaned over 
to me. "we're going to reenact the story of our lady of 
chains.  we're  taking  her  over  to  the  honey  house  and 
chaining her in there for the night." 

i thought,  our lady is spending the night in  the 

honey house. with me. 

as  august  pulled  the  wagon  slowly  across  the 
yard, zach and

the words. i cupped one hand around  the flame  of  my

up  and  helped  them  get  her  situated  between  the 
extractor and the baffle tank. 

"all right," august said. "now we'll start the last 
part of our service. why don't you stand in a semicircle 
right here around our lady." 

june  played  us  a  gloomy-sounding  song  on  the 
cello  while  august  retold  black  mary's  story  start  to 
finish.  when  she  got

fearlessness  and  plans  of  escape,  june  turned  up  the

"our  lady  became  so  powerful,"  said  august, 
"that  the  master  was  forced  to  put  her  under  house 
arrest, to chain her in the carriage house. she was cast 
down and bound up." 

"the blessed, blessed mother," mumbled violet.

wrapping  them  around  our  lady.  the  way  otis  tossed 
the chain around in the candlelight, i was sure it would 
be a miracle if he didn't kill somebody. august went on. 
"but each time the master chained mary in the carriage 
house,  she  would  break  the  chains  and  return  to  her 
people."

face like she wasn't in any kind of ru

rosaleen's  corn  fritters,  saying  they  were  the  finest 
fritters  they'd  ever  had  the  pleasure  of  eating,  which 
caused rosaleen to swell up with pride. 

"y'all stop eating up all rosaleen's fritters," june 

said. "they're for our lunch." 

"oh, let  "em eat,"  said  rosaleen, which  floored 
me, since she'd been known to smack my hand sideways 
for pinching a single crumb off her fritters before dinner. 
by  the  time  neil  and  zach  arrived,  the  fritters  were 
nearly gone, and rosaleen was in danger of floating off 
into the atmosphere. 

i stood numb and plaster stiff in the corner of the 
kitchen.  i  wanted  to  crawl  on  my  knees  back  to  the  
honey house and ball up in the bed. i wanted everybody 
to shut up and go home. 

zach started toward me, but i turned away and 
stared down the sink drain. from the corner of my eye i 
grew  aware  of  august  watching  me.  her  mouth  was

the  music  she  played  was  the  kind  that  sawed 
through  you,  cutting  into  the  secret  chambers  of  your 
heart and setting the sadness free. listening to it, i could 
see my mother sitting on a trailways bus, riding out of 
sylvan, while my  four-year-old self napped on the bed, 
not yet knowing what i would wake to.

aching. i swayed on my feet and tried not to breathe it 
in. 

• • • 
it was a relief when neil and zach stepped out of 
the honey  house  carrying our lady; it  got my mind off 
the trailways bus. they carried her under their arms like 
a tube of carpet, with the chains slapping back and forth 
against her body. you'd think they would use the wagon 
again, something a little more dignified than this. and if 
that wasn't bad enough, when they set her down, they 
deposited her in the middle of an anthill, which started 
an ant stampede. we had to jump around, shaking them 
off our feet. su

dipped  their  hands  into  a  bucket  of  water  and  washed 
off the honey. i waited till the very last, want ing to keep 
the coating of honey on my skin as long as i could. it was 
like i was wearing a pair of gloves with magic properties. 

like i could preserve whatever i touched. 
we left our lady in the yard while we ate, then 
returned and washed her with water the same slow way 
we'd washed her with honey. after neil and zach carried 
her  back  to  her  place  in  the  parlor,  everyone  left. 
august, june, and rosaleen started doing the dishes, but 
i slipped off to the honey house. i lay down on my cot, 
trying not to think.

middle of the afternoon, nearly dying of thirst, wanting 
to fill a jug with water and take it back to the river, and 
found  june  and  august  clinging  to  each  other  in  the 
middle of the floor. 

i  stood  outside  the  door  and  watched,  even 
though it was a private moment. june gripped august's 
back, and her hands trembled. 

"may  would've  loved  this  wedding,"  she  said. 
"she  must've  told  me  a  hundred  times  i  was  being 
stubborn about neil. oh, god, august, why didn't i do it 
sooner, while she was still alive?"

the doorway. 

she held june, who was starting to  cry, but she 
kept  her  eyes  on  mine.  she  said,  "regrets  don't  help 
anything, you know that."

words streamed out of me so fast i couldn't keep 
up with them, and that's all i was thinking about. i didn't 
pay  attention  to  the  knock.  later  i  would  remember  it  
didn't  sound  like  an  ordinary  knock.  more  like  a  fist 
pounding. 

i kept writing, waiting for august to answer it. i 
was sure it was the man from goose creek with the new 
queen bee. 

the  pounding  came  again.  june  had  gone  off 
with neil. rosaleen was  in  the honey  house washing a 
new shipment of mason jars, a job that belonged to me, 
but she'd volunteered for it, seeing how badly i needed 
to write everything out. i didn't know where august was. 
probably in the honey house, helping rosaleen. 

i look back and wonder: how did i not guess who 

was there? 

the  third  time  the  knocking  came,  i got  up and 

opened the door.
