own her, a wild  horse of a woman, so wild she wouldn't 
marry.  until  my  great-grandfather threw a sack over her 
head  and  carried  her off. just like  that,  as  if she  were  a 
fancy  chandelier. that's the way  he did  it. 

and the story goes she never forgave him. she looked 
out the window her whole life, the way so many women sit 
their sadness on an elbow.  i  wonder if she made the best 
with  what she got or was she sorry because she couldn't be 
all the things she wanted to be. esperanza. i have inherited 
her  name,  but  i  don't  want  to  inherit  her  place  by  the 
window. 

at  school  they say  my  name funny as  if the syllables 
were  made  out of tin  and  hurt  the  roof of your  mouth. 
but  in  spanish  my  name  is  made  out of a  softer  some­
thing,  like  silver,  not  quite  as  thick  as  sister's  name­
magdalena-which is  uglier than mine. magdalena who at 
least can come home and become nenny. but i am always 
esperanza.

my name is lucy, the big one says. this here is  rachel 

my  sister. 

i'm  her sister,  says  rachel.  who are you? 
and  i wish  my name was cassandra or alexis or ma­

ritza-anything but esperanza-but when  i  tell  them  my 
name they don't laugh. 

we  come  from  texas,  lucy  says  and  grins.  her was 

born  here, but me  i'm texas. 

you  mean she,  i  say. 
no,  1'1)1  from  texas, and doesn't get it. 
this bike is three ways ours, says rachel who is think­

day after. 

but everybody wants to ride it today because the bike 
is  new,  so  we  decide  to take  turns after tomorrow.  today 
it  helongs to all  of us.

hold out my  hand with the letter. this is no good, she says, 
till sister superior gives the okay. go upstairs and see her. 
and so  i  went. 

i had to wait for two kids in front of me to get hollered 
at, one because he did something in class, the other because 

he  didn't.  my  turn came and  i  stood  in  front  of the  big 
desk  with  holy  pictures  under  the  glass  while  the  sister 
superior read my  letter.  it went like this: 

dear sister superior, 

please  let  esperanza  eat  in  the  lunchroom 
because she lives too far away and she gets tired. 
as you can see she is very skinny.  i hope to god 
she does  not faint. 

thanking you, 
mrs.  e.  cordero 

you don't live far,  she says.  you  live  across  the bou­

levard.  that's only  four  blocks.  not even.  three  maybe. 
three  long  blocks  away  from  here.  i  bet  i  can  see  your 
house  from  my  window.  which  one?  come here.  which 
one is  your house? 

and then she  made me stand  up on a  bo

today while cooking oatmeal she is  madame butter­

ay  until  she  sighs  and  points  the wooden  spoon at  me.  i 
could've been somebody, you  know?  esperanza, you go to 
school. study hard. that madame butteray was a fool. she 
stirs the oatmeal.  look at my  comadrt!s.  she means  izaura 
whose  husband  left and yolanda whose  husband  is  dead. 
got to take care all  your own, she says  shaking her head. 

then out of nowhere: 
shame is  a bad thing, you  know.  it keeps you  down. 
you want to know why  i quit school? because i didn't have 
nice clothes.  no clothes, but i  had brains. 

yup. she says disgusted, stirring again.  i was a smart

i had never seen the dead before, not for real, not in 

somebody's living room  for  people to kiss  and bless them­
selves  and  light  a  candle  for.  not  in  a  house.  it seemed 
strange. 

they must've known, the sisters. they had the power 
and could sense what was what. they said, come here, and 
gave me a stick of gum. they smelled like  kleenex or the 
inside of a satin  handbag, and then  i didn't feel  afraid. 

what's your name,  the cat-eyed one asked.
 
esperanza,  i said.
 
esperanza, the old blue-veined one repeated in a high
 

thin voice.  esperanza ... a  good  good  name. 

my  knees  hurt,  the  one with  the  funny  laugh  com­

plained. 

tomorrow it  will  rain. 
yes,  tomorrow, they said. 
how do you  know?  i asked. 
we  know. 
look at her hands, cat-eyed  said. 
and they turned them over and over as  if they were 

looking for  something.
 

she's special.
 
yes,  she'll  go very far.
 
yes,  yes,  hmmm.

i closed  my  eyes.

yes,  i said.
 
well,  that's all  there  is  to  it.  it'll come true.
 
how do you  know?  i asked.
 
we  know,  we  know.
 
esperanza.  the  one  with  marble  hands  called  me
 
aside.  [speranza.  she held  my  face  with  her blue-veined 
hands and looked and looked at  me. a long silence. when 
you  leave  you  must  remember  always  to  come  back,  she 
said. 

what? 
when  you  leave  you  must  remember  to  come  back 
for  the  others.  a  circle,  understand?  you  will  always  be

i  belong but do not belong to. 

i  put it down  on  paper and then  the ghost does  not 
ache  so  much.  i  write  it  down  and  mango  says  goodbye 
sometimes. she does not hold me with both arms. she sets 
me  free. 

one day i will  pack my bags of books and paper. one 
day  i  will  say  goodbye to  mango.  i  am too strong for her 
to keep me here forever.  one day  i  will  go  away. 

friends  and  neighbors  will  say,  what  happened  to 
that esperanza? where did she go with all those books and 
paper? why did she march so  far away? 

they will  not know  i  have gone away  to  come back. 
for the ones i  left behind.  for the ones who cannot out.
