â€œwith pleasure! in fact, it is very necessary. i like your readiness,
prince; in fact, i must say--i--i--like you very well, altogether,â€ said
the general.

â€œwhat delightful writing materials you have here, such a lot of pencils
and things, and what beautiful paper! itâ€™s a charming room altogether.
i know that picture, itâ€™s a swiss view. iâ€™m sure the artist painted it
from nature, and that i have seen the very place--â€

â€œquite likely, though i bought it here. gania, give the prince some
paper. here are pens and paper; now then, take this table. whatâ€™s
this?â€ the general continued to gania, who had that moment taken a large
photograph out of his portfolio, and shown it to his senior. â€œhalloa!
nastasia philipovna! did she send it you herself? herself?â€ he inquired,
with much curiosity and great animation.

â€œshe gave it me just now, when i called in to congratulate her. i asked
her for it long ago. i donâ€™t know whether she meant it for a hint that
i had come empty-h

the general left the room, and the prince never succeeded in broaching
the business which he had on hand, though he had endeavoured to do so
four times.

gania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince. the latter accepted
the offer, but did not talk, being unwilling to disturb ganiaâ€™s work.
he commenced to examine the study and its contents. but gania hardly
so much as glanced at the papers lying before him; he was absent and
thoughtful, and his smile and general appearance struck the prince still
more disagreeably now that the two were left alone together.

suddenly gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over
nastasia philipovnaâ€™s portrait, gazing at it.

â€œdo you admire that sort of woman, prince?â€ he asked, looking intently
at him. he seemed to have some special object in the question.

â€œitâ€™s a wonderful face,â€ said the prince, â€œand i feel sure that her
destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one. her face is
smiling enough, but she must h

he has not the least idea where to go to,â€ said alexandra, the eldest of
the girls.

â€œbesides, heâ€™s quite a child; we can entertain him with a little
hide-and-seek, in case of need,â€ said adelaida.

â€œhide-and-seek? what do you mean?â€ inquired mrs. epanchin.

â€œoh, do stop pretending, mamma,â€ cried aglaya, in vexation. â€œsend him
up, father; mother allows.â€

the general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince should be
shown in.

â€œonly on condition that he has a napkin under his chin at lunch, then,â€
 said mrs. epanchin, â€œand let fedor, or mavra, stand behind him while he
eats. is he quiet when he has these fits? he doesnâ€™t show violence, does
he?â€

â€œon the contrary, he seems to be very well brought up. his manners
are excellent--but here he is himself. here you are, prince--let me
introduce you, the last of the muishkins, a relative of your own, my
dear, or at least of the same name. recei

â€œformerly, when i was seven years old or so. i believe i wore one; but
now i usually hold my napkin on my knee when i eat.â€

â€œof course, of course! and about your fits?â€

â€œfits?â€ asked the prince, slightly surprised. â€œi very seldom have fits
nowadays. i donâ€™t know how it may be here, though; they say the climate
may be bad for me.â€

â€œhe talks very well, you know!â€ said mrs. epanchin, who still continued
to nod at each word the prince spoke. â€œi really did not expect it at
all; in fact, i suppose it was all stuff and nonsense on the generalâ€™s
part, as usual. eat away, prince, and tell me where you were born, and
where you were brought up. i wish to know all about you, you interest me
very much!â€

the prince expressed his thanks once more, and eating heartily the
while, recommenced the narrative of his life in switzerland, all of
which we have heard before. mrs. epanchin became more and more pleased
with her guest; the girl

nature and mine must be extremely alike, and i am very glad of it. we
are like two drops of water, only you are a man and i a woman, and iâ€™ve

â€œdonâ€™t be in a hurry, mother; the prince says that he has some motive
behind his simplicity,â€ cried aglaya.

â€œyes, yes, so he does,â€ laughed the others.

â€œoh, donâ€™t you begin bantering him,â€ said mamma. â€œhe is probably a good
deal cleverer than all three of you girls put together. we shall see.

the room in conscious pride.

this next arrival was a tall red-faced man of about fifty-five, with
greyish hair and whiskers, and large eyes which stood out of their
sockets. his appearance would have been distinguished had it not been
that he gave the idea of being rather dirty. he was dressed in an old
coat, and he smelled of vodka when he came near. his walk was effective,
and he clearly did his best to appear dignified, and to impress people
by his manner.

this gentleman now approached the prince slowly, and with a most
courteous smile; silently took his hand and held it in his own, as he
examined the princeâ€™s features as though searching for familiar traits
therein.

â€œâ€˜tis he, â€˜tis he!â€ he said at last, quietly, but with much solemnity.
â€œas though he were alive once more. i heard the familiar name-the
dear familiar name--and, oh! how it reminded me of the irrevocable
past--prince muishkin, i believe?â€

â€œexactly so.â€

â€œgeneral ivolgin--retired and unfortunate. may i ask

 rise and dress in amazement; silence on
both sides. i understand it all. he takes a couple of pistols out of his
pocket--across a handkerchief--without witnesses. why invite witnesses
when both of us would be walking in eternity in a couple of minutes? the
pistols are loaded; we stretch the handkerchief and stand opposite one
another. we aim the pistols at each otherâ€™s hearts. suddenly tears start
to our eyes, our hands shake; we weep, we embrace--the battle is one of
self-sacrifice now! the prince shouts, â€˜she is yours;â€™ i cry, â€˜she is
yours--â€™ in a word, in a word--youâ€™ve come to live with us, hey?â€

â€œyes--yes--for a while, i think,â€ stammered the prince.

â€œprince, mother begs you to come to her,â€ said colia, appearing at the
door.

the prince rose to go, but the general once more laid his hand in a
friendly manner on his shoulder, and dragged him down on to the sofa.

â€œas the true friend of your father, i wish to say a few words to you,â€
 he began. â€œi have suffer

 me a good deal about you; and at the very moment that i
opened the door to you i happened to be thinking of you, when--there you
stood before me!â€

â€œand how did you recognize me?â€

â€œfrom the portrait!â€

â€œwhat else?â€

â€œi seemed to imagine you exactly as you are--i seemed to have seen you
somewhere.â€

â€œwhere--where?â€

â€œi seem to have seen your eyes somewhere; but it cannot be! i have not
seen you--i never was here before. i may have dreamed of you, i donâ€™t
know.â€

the prince said all this with manifest effort--in broken sentences, and
with many drawings of breath. he was evidently much agitated. nastasia
philipovna looked at him inquisitively, but did not laugh.

â€œbravo, prince!â€ cried ferdishenko, delighted.

at this moment a loud voice from behind the group which hedged in the
prince and nastasia philipovna, divided the crowd, as it were, and
before them stood the head of the family, general ivolgin. he was
dressed in evening clothes; his moustache was dyed.

ask, was i right in believing that you were a good deal struck yourself
with nastasia philipovna.â€

â€œye-yes.â€

â€œare you in love with her?â€

â€œn-no.â€

â€œand yet you flush up as red as a rosebud! come--itâ€™s all right. iâ€™m not
going to laugh at you. do you know she is a very virtuous woman? believe
it or not, as you like. you think she and totski--not a bit of it, not a
bit of it! not for ever so long! _au revoir!_â€

gania left the room in great good humour. the prince stayed behind, and
meditated alone for a few minutes. at length, colia popped his head in
once more.

â€œi donâ€™t want any dinner, thanks, colia. i had too good a lunch at
general epanchinâ€™s.â€

colia came into the room and gave the prince a note; it was from the
general and was carefully sealed up. it was clear from coliaâ€™s face how
painful it was to him to deliver the missive. the prince read it, rose,
and took his hat.

â€œitâ€™s only a couple of yards,â€ said colia, blushing.

â€œheâ€™s

â€œit would be very pleasant,â€ returned the prince. â€œbut we must see. i am
really rather worried just now. what! are we there already? is that the
house? what a long flight of steps! and thereâ€™s a porter! well, colia i
donâ€™t know what will come of it all.â€

the prince seemed quite distracted for the moment.

â€œyou must tell me all about it tomorrow! donâ€™t be afraid. i wish you
success; we agree so entirely i that can do so, although i do not
understand why you are here. good-bye!â€ cried colia excitedly. â€œnow i
will rush back and tell hippolyte all about our plans and proposals! but
as to your getting in--donâ€™t be in the least afraid. you will see her.

nging to see whether she could make
any guess as to the explanation of his motive in coming to her house.
the prince would very likely have made some reply to her kind words, but
he was so dazzled by her appearance that he could not speak.

nastasia noticed this with satisfaction. she was in full dress this
evening; and her appearance was certainly calculated to impress all
beholders. she took his hand and led him towards her other guests. but
just before they reached the drawing-room door, the prince stopped her,
and hurriedly and in great agitation whispered to her:

â€œyou are altogether perfection; even your pallor and thinness are
perfect; one could not wish you otherwise. i did so wish to come and see
you. i--forgive me, please--â€

â€œdonâ€™t apologize,â€ said nastasia, laughing; â€œyou spoil the whole
originality of the thing. i think what they say about you must be true,
that you are so original.--so you think me perfection, do you?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œhâ€™m! well, you may be a good r

eader of riddles but you are wrong
_there_, at all events. iâ€™ll remind you of this, tonight.â€

nastasia introduced the prince to her guests, to most of whom he was
already known.

totski immediately made some amiable remark. all seemed to brighten up at
once, and the conversation became general. nastasia made the prince sit
down next to herself.

â€œdear me, thereâ€™s nothing so very curious about the prince dropping in,
after all,â€ remarked ferdishenko.

â€œitâ€™s quite a clear case,â€ said the hitherto silent gania. â€œi have
watched the prince almost all day, ever since the moment when he first
saw nastasia philipovnaâ€™s portrait, at general epanchinâ€™s. i remember
thinking at the time what i am now pretty sure of; and what, i may say
in passing, the prince confessed to myself.â€

gania said all this per

actress.

â€œdid it succeed?â€ asked nastasia philipovna. â€œcome, letâ€™s try it, letâ€™s
try it; we really are not quite so jolly as we might be--letâ€™s try it!
we may like it; itâ€™s original, at all events!â€

â€œyes,â€ said ferdishenko; â€œitâ€™s a good idea--come along--the men begin.
of course no one need tell a story if he prefers to be disobliging. we
must draw lots! throw your slips of paper, gentlemen, into this hat, and
the prince shall draw for turns. itâ€™s a very simple game; all you have
to do is to tell the story of the worst action of your life. itâ€™s as
simple as anything. iâ€™ll prompt anyone who forgets the rules!â€

no one liked the idea much. some smiled, some frowned some objected,
but faintly, not wishing to oppose nastasiaâ€™s wishes; for this new idea
seemed to be rather well received by her. she was still in an excited,
hysterical state, laughing convulsively at nothing and everything. her
eyes were blazin

time he is probably firmly convinced, in his own mind, that i am very
well capable of it! but now, gentlemen, to business! put in your slips,
ladies and gentlemen--is yours in, mr. totski? so--then we are all
ready; now prince, draw, please.â€ the prince silently put his hand into
the hat, and drew the names. ferdishenko was first, then ptitsin, then
the general, totski next, his own fifth, then gania, and so on; the
ladies did not draw.

â€œoh, dear! oh, dear!â€ cried ferdishenko. â€œi did so hope the prince would
come out first, and then the general. well, gentlemen, i suppose i
must set a good example! what vexes me much is that i am such an

why, surely you never really wished to take _me_ into your family? _me_,

â€œi never said you were rogojinâ€™s mistress--you are _not!_â€ said the
prince, in trembling accents.

â€œnastasia philipovna, dear soul!â€ cried the actress, impatiently, â€œdo
be calm, dear! if it annoys you so--all this--do go away and rest! of
course you would never go with this wretched fellow, in spite of his

go with rogojin? you are delirious. you have returned to mr. totski his
seventy-five thousand roubles, and declared that you will leave this
house and all that is in it, which is a line of conduct that not one
person here would imitate. nastasia philipovna, i love you! i would die
for you. i shall never let any man say one word against you, nastasia
philipovna! and if we are poor, i can work for both.â€

as the prince spoke these last words a titter was heard from
ferdishenko; lebedeff laughed too. the general grunted with irritation;
ptitsin and totski barely restrained their smiles. the rest all sat
listening, open-mouthed with wonder.

â€œbut perhaps we shall not be poor; we may be very rich, nastasia
philipovna,â€ continued the prince, in the same timid, quivering tones.

was; but that a certain circumstance
in connection with the fatal evening at nastasiaâ€™s house became known
to the general, and, in fact, to all the family the very next day. this
fact was that gania had come home that night, but had refused to go to
bed. he had awaited the princeâ€™s return from ekaterinhof with feverish
impatience.

on the latterâ€™s arrival, at six in the morning, gania had gone to him
in his room, bringing with him the singed packet of money, which he had
insisted that the prince should return to nastasia philipovna without
delay. it was said that when gania entered the princeâ€™s room, he came
with anything but friendly feelings, and in a condition of despair and
misery; but that after a short conversation, he had stayed on for a
couple of hours with him, sobbing continuously and bitterly the whole
time. they had parted upon terms of cordial friendship.

the epanchins heard about this, as well as about the episode at nastasia
philipovnaâ€™s. it was strange, perhaps, that

hed, â€œand such a good,
easy-going fellow!â€

after a time it became known that totski had married a french marquise,
and was to be carried off by her to paris, and then to brittany.

â€œoh, well,â€ thought the general, â€œheâ€™s lost to us for good, now.â€

so the epanchins prepared to depart for the summer.

but now another circumstance occurred, which changed all the plans once
more, and again the intended journey was put off, much to the delight of
the general and his spouse.

a certain prince s---- arrived in st. petersburg from moscow, an eminent
and honourable young man. he was one of those active persons who always
find some good work with which to employ themselves. without forcing
himself upon the public notice, modest and unobtrusive, this young
prince was concerned with much that happened in the world in general.

he had served, at first, in one of the civil departments, had then
attended to matters connected with the local government of provincial
towns, and had of late been a 
 
 ___________________________
 
corresponding member of several important
scientific societies. he was a man of excellent family and solid means,
about thirty-five years of age.

prince s---- made the acquaintance of the generalâ€™s family, and
adelaida, the second girl, made a great impression upon him. towards
the spring he proposed to her, and she accepted him. the general and his
wife were delighted. the journey abroad was put off, and the wedding was
fixed for a day not very distant.

the trip abroad might have been enjoyed later on by mrs. epanchin and
her two remaining daughters, but for another circumstance.

it so happened that prince s---- introduced a distant relation

so in black, was laughing loudly,
her mouth wide open; and on the sofa lay a handsome young man,
with black hair and eyes, and a suspicion of beard and whiskers. he
frequently interrupted the speaker and argued with him, to the great
delight of the others.

â€œlukian timofeyovitch! lukian timofeyovitch! hereâ€™s someone to see you!
look here!... a gentleman to speak to you!... well, itâ€™s not my fault!â€
 and the cook turned and went away red with anger.

lebedeff started, and at sight of the prince stood like a statue for a
moment. then he moved up to him with an ingratiating smile, but stopped
short again.

â€œprince! ex-ex-excellency!â€ he stammered. then suddenly he ran towards
the girl with the infant, a movement so unexpected by her that she
staggered and fell back, but next moment he was threatening the other
child, who was standing, still laughing, in the doorway. she screamed,
and ran towards the kitchen. lebedeff stamped his foot angrily;
then, seeing the prince regarding him with

 deluged himself with scent, and was always smiling like
a child. peter zakkaritch recalled my interview with him, and said, â€˜_you
foretold his death._â€™â€

the prince rose from his seat, and lebedeff, surprised to see his
guest preparing to go so soon, remarked: â€œyou are not interested?â€ in a
respectful tone.

â€œi am not very well, and my head aches. doubtless the effect of the
journey,â€ replied the prince, frowning.

â€œyou should go into the country,â€ said lebedeff timidly.

the prince seemed to be considering the suggestion.

â€œyou see, i am going into the country myself in three days, with my
children and belongings. the little one is delicate; she needs change
of air; and during our absence this house will be done up. i am going to
pavlofsk.â€

â€œyou are going to pavlofsk too?â€ asked the prince sharply. â€œeverybody
seems to be going there. have you a house in that neighbourhood?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know of many people going to pavlofsk, and as for the house,

the prince rose.

on his right hand. â€œi havenâ€™t seen you for a long time.â€

to flash in the manâ€™s eyes, combined with an intense anger.

â€œyour love is mingled with hatred, and therefore, when your love passes,
there will be the greater misery,â€ said the prince. â€œi tell you this,
parfen--â€

â€œwhat! that iâ€™ll cut her throat, you mean?â€

the prince shuddered.

â€œyouâ€™ll hate her afterwards for all your present love, and for all the
torment you are suffering on her account now. what seems to me the most
extraordinary thing is, that she can again consent to marry you, after
all that has passed between you. when i heard the news yesterday, i
could hardly bring myself to believe it. why, she has run twice
from you, from the very altar rails, as it were. she must have some

â€œdo you cut your pages with it, or what?â€ asked muishkin, still rather
absently, as though unable to throw off a deep preoccupation into which
the conversation had thrown him.

â€œitâ€™s a garden knife, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œyes. canâ€™t one cut pages with a garden knife?â€

â€œitâ€™s quite new.â€

â€œwell, what of that? canâ€™t i buy a new knife if i like?â€ shouted rogojin
furiously, his irritation growing with every word.

the prince shuddered, and gazed fixedly at parfen. suddenly he burst out
laughing.

â€œwhy, what an idea!â€ he said. â€œi didnâ€™t mean to ask you any of these
questions; i was thinking of something quite different! but my head is
heavy, and i seem so absent-minded nowadays! well, good-bye--i canâ€™t
remember what i wanted to say--good-bye!â€

â€œhow strangely you speak, and how odd you look!â€ said the other,
involuntarily.

â€œi like looking at that picture,â€ muttered rogojin, not noticing,
apparently, that the prince had not answered his question.

â€œthat picture! that picture!â€ cried muishkin, struck by a sudden idea.
â€œwhy, a manâ€™s faith might be ruined by looking at that picture!â€

â€œso it is!â€ said rogojin, unexpectedly. they had now reached the front
door.

the prince stopped.

â€œhow?â€ he said. â€œwhat do you mean? i was half joking, and you took me up
quite seriously! why do you ask me whether i believe in god?â€

â€œoh, no particular reason. i meant to ask you before--many people are
unbelievers nowadays, especially russians, i have been told. you ought
to know--youâ€™ve lived abroad.â€

rogojin laughed bitterly as he said these words, and opening the door,
held it for the prince to pass out. muishkin looked surprised, but went

landing. â€œhave you got that cross you bought from the soldier with you?â€

â€œyes, i have,â€ and the prince stopped again.

â€œshow it me, will you?â€

a new fancy! the prince reflected, and then mounted the stairs once
more. he pulled out the cross without taking it off his neck.

â€œgive it to me,â€ said parfen.

â€œwhy? do you--â€

the prince would rather have kept this particular cross.

â€œiâ€™ll wear it; and you shall have mine. iâ€™ll take it off at once.â€

thought he observed in her the symptoms of madness. he had almost fallen
into despair. how could he have lost his hold upon her when she ran away
from him to rogojin? he ought to have run after her himself, rather than
wait for news as he had done. can rogojin have failed to observe, up
to now, that she is mad? rogojin attributes her strangeness to other
causes, to passion! what insane jealousy! what was it he had hinted at
in that suggestion of his? the prince suddenly blushed, and shuddered to
his very heart.

but why recall all this? there was insanity on both sides. for him, the
prince, to love this woman with passion, was unthinkable. it would be
cruel and inhuman. yes. rogojin is not fair to himself; he has a large
heart; he has aptitude for sympathy. when he learns the truth, and finds
what a pitiable being is this injured, broken, half-insane creature, he
will forgive her all the torment she has caused him. he will become her

copecks. and as the prince sat dreaming in the summer garden under a
lime-tree, a wicked demon had come and whispered in his car: â€œrogojin
has been spying upon you and watching you all the morning in a frenzy
of desperation. when he finds you have not gone to pavlofsk--a terrible
discovery for him--he will surely go at once to that house in petersburg
side, and watch for you there, although only this morning you gave
your word of honour not to see _her_, and swore that you had not come to
petersburg for that purpose.â€ a

dissuaded her, though they
were not willing to stay behind when she at once prepared to go and
visit the invalid. aglaya, however, suggested that it was a little
unceremonious to go _en masse_ to see him.

â€œvery well then, stay at home,â€ said mrs. epanchin, â€œand a good thing
too, for evgenie pavlovitch is coming down and there will be no one at
home to receive him.â€

of course, after this, aglaya went with the rest. in fact, she had never
had the slightest intention of doing otherwise.

prince s., who was in the house, was requested to escort the ladies.
he had been much interested when he first heard of the prince from the
epanchins. it appeared that they had known one another before, and had
spent some time together in a little provincial town three months
ago. prince s. had greatly taken to him, and was delighted with the
opportunity of meeting him again.

the general had not come down from town as yet, nor had evgenie
pavlovitch arrived.

it was not more than two or three hundred ya

rds from the epanchinsâ€™
house to lebedeffâ€™s. the first disagreeable impression experienced by
mrs. epanchin was to find the prince surrounded by a whole assembly of
other guests--not to mention the fact that some of those present were
particularly detestable in her eyes. the next annoying circumstance was
when an apparently strong and healthy young fellow, well dressed,
and smiling, came forward to meet her on the terrace, instead of the
half-dying unfortunate whom she had expected to see.

she was astonished and vexed, and her disappointment pleased colia
immensely. of course he could have undeceived her before she started,

â€œi hardly knew him; he is much changed, and for the better!â€

â€œi am very glad,â€ said the prince.

â€œhe has been very ill,â€ added varia.

â€œhow has he changed for the better?â€ asked mrs. epanchin. â€œi donâ€™t see
any change for the better! whatâ€™s better in him? where did you get _that_
idea from? _whatâ€™s_ better?â€

â€œthereâ€™s nothing better than the â€˜poor knightâ€™!â€ said colia, who was
standing near the last speakerâ€™s chair.

â€œi quite agree with you there!â€ said prince s., laughing.

â€œso do i,â€ said adelaida, solemnly.

â€œ_what_ poor knight?â€ asked mrs. epanchin, looking round at the face of
each of the speakers in turn. seeing, however, that aglaya was blushing,
she added, angrily:

â€œwhat nonsense you are all talking! what do you mean by poor knight?â€

â€œitâ€™s not the first time this urchin, your favourite, has shown his
impudence by twisting other peopleâ€™s words,â€ said aglaya, haughtily.

every time that aglaya showed temper (and this was very
 
 ___________________________
 
 often), there
was so much childish pouting, such â€œschool-girlishness,â€ as it were, in
her apparent wrath, that it was impossible to avoid smiling at her, to
her own unutterable indignation. on these occasions she would say, â€œhow
can they, how _dare_ they laugh at me?â€

this time everyone laughed at her, her sisters, prince s., prince
muishkin (though he himself had flushed for some reason), and colia.
aglaya was dreadfully indignant, and looked twice as pretty in her
wrath.

â€œheâ€™s always twisting round what one says,â€ she cried.

â€œi am only repeating your own exclamation!â€ said colia. â€œa month ago you
were turning over the pages of your don quixote, and suddenly called out
â€˜there is nothing better than the poor knight.â€™ i donâ€™t know whom
you were referring to, of course, whether to don quixote, or

evgenie
pavlovitch, or someone else, but you certainly said these words, and
afterwards there was a long conversation...â€

â€œyou are inclined to go a little too far, my good boy, with your
guesses,â€ said mrs. epanchin, with some show of annoyance.

â€œbut itâ€™s not i alone,â€ cried colia. â€œthey all talked about it, and they
do still. why, just now prince s. and adelaida ivanovna declared that
they upheld â€˜the poor knightâ€™; so evidently there does exist a â€˜poor
knightâ€™; and if it were not for adelaida ivanovna, we should have known
long ago who the â€˜poor knightâ€™ was.â€

â€œwhy, how am i to blame?â€ asked adelaida, smiling.

â€œyou wouldnâ€™t draw his portrait for us, thatâ€™s why you are to blame!
aglaya ivanovna asked you to draw his portrait, and gave you the whole
subject of the picture. she invented it herself; and you wouldnâ€™t.

etty clearly though what
it meant, and whom they referred to by the generally accepted title of
â€œpoor knight.â€ but what specially annoyed her was that the prince was
looking so uncomfortable, and blushing like a ten-year-old child.

â€œwell, have you finished your silly joke?â€ she added, â€œand am i to be
told what this â€˜poor knightâ€™ means, or is it a solemn secret which
cannot be approached lightly?â€

but they all laughed on.

â€œitâ€™s simply that there is a russian poem,â€ began prince s., evidently
anxious to change the conversation, â€œa strange thing, without beginning
or end, and all about a â€˜poor knight.â€™ a month or so ago, we were all
talking and laughing, and looking up a subject for one of adelaidaâ€™s
pictures--you know it is the principal business of this family to find
subjects for adelaidaâ€™s pictures. well, we happened upon this â€˜poor
knight.â€™ i donâ€™t remember who thought of it first--â€

â€œoh! aglaya ivanovna did,â€ said colia.

â€œvery likely--i donâ

â€œsome of us laughed at the subject; some liked it; but she declared
that, in order to make a picture of the gentleman, she must first see
his face. we then began to think over all our friendsâ€™ faces to see
if any of them would do, and none suited us, and so the matter stood;
thatâ€™s all. i donâ€™t know why nicolai ardalionovitch has brought up
the joke now. what was appropriate and funny then, has quite lost all
interest by this time.â€

â€œprobably thereâ€™s some new silliness about it,

they certainly were put out, both of them.

the prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could
not get his words out. aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her
little speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the
least embarrassed. she seemed, in fact, quite pleased.

she now rose solemnly from her seat, walked to the centre of the
terrace, and stood in front of the princeâ€™s chair. all looked on with
some surprise, and prince s. and her sisters with feelings of decided
alarm, to see what new frolic she was up to; it had gone quite far
enough already, they thought. but aglaya evidently thoroughly enjoyed
the affectation and ceremony with which she was introducing her
recitation of the poem.

mrs. epanchin was just wondering whether she would not forbid the
performance after all, when, at the very moment that aglaya commenced
her declamation, two new guests, both talking loudly, entered from the
street. the new arrivals

avlovitch to him.

â€œi caught him up on the way to your house,â€ explained the general. â€œhe
had heard that we were all here.â€

â€œyes, and i heard that you were here, too,â€ added evgenie pavlovitch;
â€œand since i had long promised myself the pleasure of seeking not only
your acquaintance but your friendship, i did not wish to waste time, but
came straight on. i am sorry to hear that you are unwell.â€

â€œoh, but iâ€™m quite well now, thank you, and very glad to make your
acquaintance. prince s. has often spoken to me about you,â€ said
muishkin, and for an instant the two men looked intently into one
anotherâ€™s eyes.

the prince remarked that evgenie pavlovitchâ€™s plain clothes had
evidently made a great impression upon the company present, so much so
that all other interests seemed to be effaced before this surprising
fact.

his change of dress was evidently a matter of some importance. adelaida
and alexandra poured out a stream of questions; prince s., a relative
of the young man,

dead, as the article which was just read to us makes out. sit down,
gentlemen, sit down!â€

the prince sat down, and at length prevailed upon burdovskyâ€™s company
to do likewise. during the last ten or twenty minutes, exasperated by
continual interruptions, he had raised his voice, and spoken with
great vehemence. now, no doubt, he bitterly regretted several words and
expressions which had escaped him in his excitement. if he had not been
driven beyond the limits of endurance, he would not have ventured to
express certain conjectures so openly. he had no sooner sat down than
his heart was torn by

â€œwho indeed?â€ exclaimed prince s.

â€œit reminds me,â€ said evgenie pavlovitch, laughing, â€œof the famous plea
of a certain lawyer who lately defended a man for murdering six people
in order to rob them. he excused his client on the score of poverty.

of misery he was in, that he should have thought of murdering these six

in a state of terrible excitement she threw back her head, with flaming
eyes, casting looks of contempt and defiance upon the whole company,
in which she could no longer distinguish friend from foe. she had
restrained herself so long that she felt forced to vent her rage on
somebody. those who knew lizabetha prokofievna saw at once how it was
with her. â€œshe flies into these rages sometimes,â€ said ivan fedorovitch
to prince s. the next day, â€œbut she is not often so violent as she was
yesterday; it does not happen more than once in three years.â€

â€œbe quiet, ivan fedorovitch! leave me alone!â€ cried mrs. epanchin. â€œwhy
do you offer me your arm now? you had not sense enough to take me away
before. you are my husband, you are a father, it was your duty to drag
me away by force, if in my folly i refused to obey you and go quietly.

doktorenko. â€œyou are as sure of him now as if you had the money in your
pocket. and there you are playing the swaggerer to throw dust in our
eyes! no, my dear sir, you may take other people in! i can see through

â€œlizabetha prokofievna!â€ exclaimed the prince.

â€œcome, lizabetha prokofievna, it is quite time for us to be going,
we will take the prince with us,â€ said prince s. with a smile, in the
coolest possible way.

the girls stood apart, almost frightened; their father was positively
horrified. mrs. epanchinâ€™s language astonished everybody. some who stood
a little way off smiled furtively, and talked in whispers. lebedeff wore
an expression of utmost ecstasy.

â€œchaos and scandal are to be found everywhere, madame,â€ remarked
doktorenko, who was considerably put out of countenance.

â€œnot like this! nothing like the spectacle you have just given us, sir,â€

â€œthank you for the lesson, general,â€ said hippolyte, with unexpected
gravity, regarding him thoughtfully.

â€œtwo minutes more, if you please, dear ivan fedorovitch,â€ said lizabetha
prokofievna to her husband; â€œit seems to me that he is in a fever
and delirious; you can see by his eyes what a state he is in; it is
impossible to let him go back to petersburg tonight. can you put him
up, lef nicolaievitch? i hope you are not bored, dear prince,â€ she
added suddenly to prince s. â€œalexandra, my dear, come here! your hair is
coming down.â€

she arranged her daughterâ€™s hair, which was not in the least disordered,
and gave her a kiss. this was all that she had called her for.

â€œi thought you were capable of development,â€ said hippolyte, coming out
of his fit of abstraction. â€œyes, that is what i meant to say,â€ he added,
with the satisfaction of one who suddenly remembers something he had
forgotten. â€œhere is burdovsky, sincerely anxious to protect his mother;

his mind. he sorrowfully asked himself whether he had been the cause of
this new â€œmonstrosity,â€ or was it... but he refrained from saying who
else might be in fault. as for the letters n.p.b., he looked on that as
a harmless joke, a mere childish piece of mischief--so childish that
he felt it would be shameful, almost dishonourable, to attach any
importance to it.

the day after these scandalous events, however, the prince had the
honour of receiving a visit from adelaida and her fiance, prince s. they
came, ostensibly, to inquire after his health. they had wandered out for
a walk, and called in â€œby accident,â€ and talked for almost the whole
of the time they were with him about a certain most lovely tree in the
park, which adelaida had set her heart upon for a picture. this, and a
little amiable conversation on prince s.â€™s part, occupied the time, and
not a word was said about last eveningâ€™s episodes. at length adelaida
burst out laughing, apologized, and explained that they had 
 
 ___________________________
 
come
incognito; from which, and from the circumstance that they said nothing
about the princeâ€™s either walking back with them or coming to see them
later on, the latter inferred that he was in mrs. epanchinâ€™s black
books. adelaida mentioned a watercolour that she would much like to show
him, and explained that she would either send it by colia, or bring it
herself the next day--which to the prince seemed very suggestive.

at length, however, just as the visitors were on the point of departing,
prince s. seemed suddenly to recollect himself. â€œoh yes, by-the-by,â€ he
said, â€œdo you happen to know, my dear lef nicolaievitch, who that lady
was who called out to evgenie pavlovitch last night, from the carriage?â€

â€œit was nastasia philipovna,â€ said the prince; â€œdidnâ€™t you know that? i
cannot tell you who her companion was.â€

â€œbut what on earth did she mean? i assure you it is a

real riddle
to me--to me, and to others, too!â€ prince s. seemed to be under the
influence of sincere astonishment.

â€œshe spoke of some bills of evgenie pavlovitchâ€™s,â€ said the prince,
simply, â€œwhich rogojin had bought up from someone; and implied that
rogojin would not press him.â€

â€œoh, i heard that much, my dear fellow! but the thing is so impossibly
absurd! a man of property like evgenie to give iouâ€™s to a money-lender,
and to be worried about them! it is ridiculous. besides, he cannot
possibly be on such intimate terms with nastasia 
 
 ___________________________
 
see.â€ he embraced the prince, and kissed him.

â€œwhat do you mean, though,â€ asked muishkin, â€œâ€˜by such a businessâ€™? i
donâ€™t see any particular â€˜businessâ€™ about it at all!â€

â€œoh, undoubtedly, this person wished somehow, and for some reason, to
do evgenie pavlovitch a bad turn, by attributing to him--before
witnesses--qualities which he neither has nor can have,â€ replied prince
s. drily enough.

muiskhin looked disturbed, but continued to gaze intently and
questioningly into prince s.â€™s face. the latter, however, remained
silent.

â€œthen it was not simply a matter of bills?â€ muishkin said at last, with
some impatience. â€œit was not as she said?â€

â€œbut i ask you, my dear sir, how can there be anything in common between
evgenie pavlovitch, and--her, and again rogojin? i tell you he is a man
of immense wealth--as i know for a fact; and he has further expectations
from his uncle. simply nastasia philipovna--â€

prince s. paused, as though unwilling to continue talking

a lovely carriage,â€ said adelaida.

â€œyes, it was a beautiful turn-out, certainly!â€

the visitors left the house, however, on no less friendly terms than
before. but the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince, from
his own point of view. admitting that he had his suspicions, from
the moment of the occurrence of last night, perhaps even before, that
nastasia had some mysterious end in view, yet this visit confirmed his
suspicions and justified his fears. it was all clear to him; prince s.
was wrong, perhaps, in his view of the matter, but he was somewhere near
the truth, and was right in so far as that he understood there to be
an intrigue of some sort going on. perhaps prince s. saw it all more
clearly than he had allowed his hearers to understand. at all events,
nothing could be plainer than that he and adelaida had come for the
express purpose of obtaining explanations, and that they suspected him
of being concerned in the affair. and if all this were so, then _she_ must
have

ing motives and so on--am i using the word â€˜scepticâ€™ in
its proper sense?â€

â€œi believe so; but iâ€™m not sure.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™ll change it, right or wrong; iâ€™ll say that you are not
sceptical, but _jealous_. there! you are deadly jealous of gania, over
a certain proud damsel! come!â€ colia jumped up, with these words, and
burst out laughing. he laughed as he had perhaps never laughed before,
and still more when he saw the prince flushing up to his temples. he was
delighted that the prince should be jealous about aglaya. however, he
stopped immediately on seeing that the other was really hurt, and the
conversation continued, very earnestly, for an hour or more.

next day the prince had to go to town, on business. returning in the
afternoon, he happened upon general epanchin at the station. the latter
seized his hand, glancing around nervously, as if he were afraid
of being caught in wrong-doing, and dragged him into a first-class
compartment. he was burning to speak about something

 itâ€™s impossible! what object could they have?â€ he
jumped up from his chair in his excitement.

â€œnor do i believe it, in spite of the proofs. the girl is self-willed
and fantastic, and insane! sheâ€™s wicked, wicked! iâ€™ll repeat it for
a thousand years that sheâ€™s wicked; they _all_ are, just now, all my
daughters, even that â€˜wet henâ€™ alexandra. and yet i donâ€™t believe it.
because i donâ€™t choose to believe it, perhaps; but i donâ€™t. why havenâ€™t
you been?â€ she turned on the prince suddenly. â€œwhy didnâ€™t you come near
us all these three days, eh?â€

the prince began to give his reasons, but she interrupted him again.

â€œeverybody takes you in and deceives you; you went to town yesterday. i
dare swear you went down on your knees to that rogue, and begged him to
accept your ten thousand roubles!â€

â€œi never thought of doing any such thing. i have not seen him, and he is
not a rogue, in my opinion. i have had a letter from him.â€

â€œshow it me!â€

the prince took a p

want? why donâ€™t they get married? for no other reason than to vex their
mother--none--none!â€

but lizabetha prokofievna felt somewhat consoled when she could say that
one of her girls, adelaida, was settled at last. â€œit will be one off our
hands!â€ she declared aloud, though in private she expressed herself with
greater tenderness. the engagement was both happy and suitable, and was
therefore approved in society. prince s. was a distinguished man, he
had money, and his future wife was devoted to him; what more could
be desired? lizabetha prokofievna had felt less anxious about this
daughter, however, although she considered her artistic tastes
suspicious. but to make up for them she was, as her mother expressed it,
â€œmerry,â€ and had plenty of â€œcommon-sense.â€ it was aglayaâ€™s future which
disturbed her most. with regard to her eldest daughter, alexandra, the
mother never quite knew whether there was cause

as settled; and with her name that of aglayaâ€™s was
linked, in society gossip. people whispered that aglaya, too, was â€œas
good as engaged;â€ and aglaya always looked so sweet and behaved so
well (during this period), that the motherâ€™s heart was full of joy. of
course, evgenie pavlovitch must be thoroughly studied first, before
the final step should be taken; but, really, how lovely dear aglaya had
become--she actually grew more beautiful every day! and then--yes, and
then--this abominable prince showed his face again, and everything went
topsy-turvy at once, and everyone seemed as mad as march hares.

what had really happened?

if it had been any other family than the epanchinsâ€™, nothing particular
would have happened. but, thanks to mrs. epanchinâ€™s invariable fussiness
and anxiety, there could not be the slightest hitch in the simplest
matters of everyday life, but she immediately foresaw the most dreadful
and alarming consequences, and suffered accordingly.

what then must have been

ng that well-known voice, although she had
written and forbidden him to come again!

â€œwhat on earth will she say to me, i wonder?â€ he thought to himself.

he had not said a word yet; he sat silent and listened to evgenie
pavlovitchâ€™s eloquence. the latter had never appeared so happy and
excited as on this evening. the prince listened to him, but for a long
time did not take in a word he said.

excepting ivan fedorovitch, who had not as yet returned from town, the
whole family was present. prince s. was there; and they all intended to
go out to hear the band very soon.

colia arrived presently and joined the circle. â€œso he is received as
usual, after all,â€ thought the prince.

the epanchinsâ€™ country-house was a charming building, built after the
model of a swiss chalet, and covered with creepers. it was surrounded on
all sides by a flower garden, and the family sat, as a rule, on the open
verandah as at the princeâ€™s house.

 be angry with evgenie,
because he spoke on a serious subject in a frivolous manner, pretending
to be in earnest, but with an under-current of irony.

â€œi was saying just now, before you came in, prince, that there has
been nothing national up to now, about our liberalism, and nothing the
liberals do, or have done, is in the least degree national. they are
drawn from two classes only, the old landowning class, and clerical
families--â€

â€œhow, nothing that they have done is russian?â€ asked prince s.

â€œit may be russian, but it is not national. our liberals are not
russian, nor are our conservatives, and you may be sure that the nation
does not recognize anything that has been done by the landed gentry, or
by the seminarists, or what is to be done either.â€

â€œcome, thatâ€™s good! how can you maintain such a paradox? if you are
serious, that is. i cannot allow such a statement about the landed
proprietors to pass unchallenged. why, you are a landed proprietor
yourself!â€ cried prince s

hich has not been repeated at any other time or
place; and therefore, though i hold to it as a fact, yet i recognize
that it is an accidental phenomenon, and may likely enough pass away.
there can be no such thing anywhere else as a liberal who really hates
his country; and how is this fact to be explained among _us?_ by
my original statement that a russian liberal is _not_ a _russian_
liberal--thatâ€™s the only explanation that i can see.â€

â€œi take all that you have said as a joke,â€ said prince s. seriously.

â€œi have not seen all kinds of liberals, and cannot, therefore, set
myself up as a judge,â€ said alexandra, â€œbut i have heard all you have
said with indignation. you have taken some accidental case and twisted
it into a universal law, which is unjust.â€

â€œaccidental case!â€ said evgenie pavlovitch. â€œdo you consider it an
accidental case, prince?â€

â€œi must also admit,â€ said the prince, â€œthat i have not seen much, or
been very far into the question; but i cannot help

rd this extraordinary plea was probably absolutely convinced that
he was stating the most liberal, the most humane, the most enlightened
view of the case that could possibly be brought forward in these days.
now, was this distortion, this capacity for a perverted way of viewing
things, a special or accidental case, or is such a general rule?â€

everyone laughed at this.

â€œa special case--accidental, of course!â€ cried alexandra and adelaida.

â€œlet me remind you once more, evgenie,â€ said prince s., â€œthat your joke
is getting a little threadbare.â€

â€œwhat do you think about it, prince?â€ asked evgenie, taking no notice
of the last remark, and observing muishkinâ€™s serious eyes fixed upon his
face. â€œwhat do you think--was it a special or a usual case--the rule, or
an exception? i confess i put the question especially for you.â€

â€œno, i donâ€™t think it was a special case,â€ said the prince, quietly, but
firmly.

â€œmy dear fellow!â€ cried prince s., with some annoyance, â€œdo

â€œmy dear prince,â€ continued prince s. â€œremember what you and i were
saying two or three months ago. we spoke of the fact that in our newly
opened law courts one could already lay oneâ€™s finger upon so many
talented and remarkable young barristers. how pleased you were with
the state of things as we found it, and how glad i was to observe your
delight! we both said it was a matter to be proud of; but this clumsy
defence that evgenie mentions, this strange argument _can_, of course,
only be an accidental case--one in a thousand!â€

times, and not only here in russia, but everywhere else as well. and in
my opinion it is not at all likely that such murders will cease to occur
for a very long time to come. the only difference is that in former
times there was less publicity, while now everyone talks and writes
freely about such things--which fact gives the impression that such
crimes have only now sprung into existence. that is where your mistake
lies--an extremely natural mistake, i assure you, my dear fellow!â€ said
prince s.

â€œi know that there were just as many, and just as terrible, crimes
before our times. not long since i visited a convict prison and made
acquaintance with some of the criminals. there were some even more
dreadful criminals than this one we have been speaking of--men who
have murdered a dozen of their fellow-creatures, and feel no remorse
whatever. but what i especially noticed was this, that the very most
hopeless and remorseless murderer--however hardened a criminal he may
be--still _knows t

 is, he is conscious that
he has acted wickedly, though he may feel no remorse whatever. and they
were all like this. those of whom evgenie pavlovitch has spoken, do not
admit that they are criminals at all; they think they had a right to
do what they did, and that they were even doing a good deed, perhaps.
i consider there is the greatest difference between the two cases.
and recollect--it was a _youth_, at the particular age which is most
helplessly susceptible to the distortion of ideas!â€

prince s. was now no longer smiling; he gazed at the prince in
bewilderment.

alexandra, who had seemed to wish to put in her word when the prince
began, now sat silent, as though some sudden thought had caused her to
change her mind about speaking.

evgenie pavlovitch gazed at him in real surprise, and this time his
expression of face had no mockery in it whatever.

â€œwhat are you looking so surprised about, my friend?â€ asked mrs.
epanchin, suddenly. â€œdid you suppose he was stupider than yourself,

just taken the princeâ€™s part. â€œi dare swear that you went up to town
yesterday on purpose to get the little wretch to do you the great honour
of coming to stay at your house. you did go up to town, you know you
did--you said so yourself! now then, did you, or did you not, go down on
your knees and beg him to come, confess!â€

â€œno, he didnâ€™t, for i saw it all myself,â€ said colia. â€œon the contrary,
hippolyte kissed his hand twice and thanked him; and all the prince said
was that he thought hippolyte might feel better here in the country!â€

â€œdonâ€™t, colia,--what is the use of saying all that?â€ cried the prince,
rising and taking his hat.

â€œwhere are you going to now?â€ cried mrs. epanchin.

â€œnever mind about him now, prince,â€ said colia. â€œhe is all right and
taking a nap after the journey. he is very happy to be here; but i think
perhaps it would be better if you let him alone for today,--he is very
sensitive now that he is so ill--and he migh

 laughed evgenie.

â€œi donâ€™t think you should take it quite like that,â€ said the prince,
quietly, and without removing his eyes from the carpet. â€œi think it is
more a case of his forgiving you.â€

â€œforgiving me! why so? what have i done to need his forgiveness?â€

â€œif you donâ€™t understand, then--but of course, you do understand.
he wished--he wished to bless you all round and to have your
blessing--before he died--thatâ€™s all.â€

â€œmy dear prince,â€ began prince s., hurriedly, exchanging glances with
some of those present, â€œyou will not easily find heaven on earth, and
yet you seem to expect to. heaven is a difficult thing to find anywhere,
prince; far more difficult than appears to that good heart of yours.
better stop this conversation, or we shall all be growing quite
disturbed in our minds, and--â€

â€œletâ€™s go and hear the band, then,â€ said lizabetha prokofievna, angrily
rising from her place.

the rest of the company followed her example.

the prince suddenly approached evgenie pavlovitch.

â€œevgenie pavlovitch,â€ he said, with strange excitement and seizing the
latterâ€™s hand in his own, â€œbe assured that i esteem you as a generous
and honourable man, in spite of everything. be assured of that.â€

evgenie pavlovitch fell back a step in astonishment. for one moment it
was all he could do to restrain himself from bursting out laughing; but,
looking closer, he observed that the prince did not seem to be quite
himself; at all events, he was

â€™t you think so?â€

he seemed to pause for a reply, for some verdict, as it were, and looked
humbly around him.

all present stood rooted to the earth with amazement at this unexpected
and apparently uncalled-for outbreak; but the poor princeâ€™s painful and
rambling speech gave rise to a strange episode.

â€œwhy do you say all this here?â€ cried aglaya, suddenly. â€œwhy do you talk
like this to _them?_â€

she appeared to be in the last stages of wrath and irritation; her eyes
flashed. the prince stood dumbly and blindly before her, and suddenly
grew pale.

â€œthere is not one of them all who is worthy of these words of yours,â€
 continued aglaya. â€œnot one of them is worth your little finger, not one
of them has heart or head to compare with yours! you are more honest
than all, and better, nobler, kinder, wiser than all. there are some
here who are unworthy to bend and pick up the handkerchief you have just
dropped. why do you humiliate yourself like this, and place yourself
lower than

rince approached aglaya.

she took the handkerchief from her face, glanced keenly at him, took
in what he had said, and burst out laughing--such a merry, unrestrained
laugh, so hearty and gay, that. adelaida could not contain herself. she,
too, glanced at the princeâ€™s panic-stricken countenance, then rushed at
her sister, threw her arms round her neck, and burst into as merry a
fit of laughter as aglayaâ€™s own. they laughed together like a couple of
school-girls. hearing and seeing this, the prince smiled happily, and in
accents of relief and joy, he exclaimed â€œwell, thank god--thank god!â€

alexandra now joined in, and it looked as though the three sisters were
going to laugh on for ever.

â€œthey are insane,â€ muttered lizabetha prokofievna. â€œeither they frighten
one out of oneâ€™s wits, or else--â€

but prince s. was laughing now, too, so was evgenie pavlovitch, so was
colia, and so was the prince himself, who caught the infection as he
looked round radiantly upon the others.

there--so. now, come along, you and i will lead the way. would you like
to lead the way with me alone, tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte?â€

she went on talking and chatting without a pause, with occasional little
bursts of laughter between.

â€œthank god--thank god!â€ said lizabetha prokofievna to herself, without
quite knowing why she felt so relieved.

â€œwhat extraordinary people they are!â€ thought prince s., for perhaps
the hundredth time since he had entered into intimate relations with the
family; but--he liked these â€œextraordinary people,â€ all the same. as for
prince lef nicolaievitch himself, prince s. did not seem quite to like
him, somehow. he was decidedly preoccupied and a little disturbed as
they all started off.

evgenie pavlovitch seemed to be in a lively humour. he made adelaida and
alexandra laugh all the way to the vauxhall; but they both laughed
so very really and promptly that

the worthy evgenie began at last to
suspect that they were not listening to him at all.

at this idea, he burst out laughing all at once, in quite unaffected
mirth, and without giving any explanation.

the sisters, who also appeared to be in high spirits, never tired of
glancing at aglaya and the prince, who were walking in front. it was
evident that their younger sister was a thorough puzzle to them both.

prince s. tried hard to get up a conversation with mrs. epanchin upon
outside subjects, probably with the good intention of distracting and
amusing her; but he bored her dreadfully. she was absent-minded to a
degree, and answered at cross purposes, and sometimes not at all.

but the puzzle and mystery of aglaya was not yet over for the evening.
the last exhibition fell to the lot of the prince alone. when they had
proceeded some hundred paces or so from the house, aglaya said to her
obstinately silent ca

g them was a young officer, a
remarkably handsome fellow--very good-natured and a great chatterbox. he
tried to get up a conversation with aglaya, and did his best to secure
her attention. aglaya behaved very graciously to him, and chatted
and laughed merrily. evgenie pavlovitch begged the princeâ€™s leave to
introduce their friend to him. the prince hardly realized what was
wanted of him, but the introduction came off; the two men bowed and
shook hands.

evgenie pavlovitchâ€™s friend asked the prince some question, but the
latter did not reply, or if he did, he muttered something so strangely
indistinct that there was nothing to be made of it. the officer stared
intently at him, then glanced at evgenie, divined why the latter had
introduced him, and gave his undivided attention to aglaya again. only
evgenie pavlovitch observed that aglaya flushed up for a moment at this.

the prince did not notice that others were talking and making themselves
agreeable to aglaya; in fact, at moments, he almos

he would gaze at her as though she were an object a couple of miles
distant, or as though he were looking at her portrait and not at herself
at all.

â€œwhy do you look at me like that, prince?â€ she asked suddenly, breaking
off her merry conversation and laughter with those about her. â€œiâ€™m
afraid of you! you look as though you were just going to put out
your hand and touch my face to see if itâ€™s real! doesnâ€™t he, evgenie
pavlovitch--doesnâ€™t he look like that?â€

the prince seemed surprised that he should have been addressed at all;
he reflected a moment, but did not seem to take in what had been said
to him; at all events, he did not answer. but observing that she and
the others had begun to laugh, he too opened his mouth and laughed with
them.

the laughter became general, and the young officer, who seemed a
particularly lively sort of person, simply shook with mirth.

aglaya suddenly whispered angrily to herself the word--

â€œidiot!â€

â€œmy goodness--surely she

as it were, was doubtless premeditated, and had its special
object, yet evgenie pavlovitch at first seemed to intend to make no
show of observing either his tormentor or her words. but nastasiaâ€™s
communication struck him with the force of a thunderclap. on hearing
of his uncleâ€™s death he suddenly grew as white as a sheet, and turned
towards his informant.

at this moment, lizabetha prokofievna rose swiftly from her seat,
beckoned her companions, and left the place almost at a run.

only the prince stopped behind for a moment, as though in indecision;
and evgenie pavlovitch lingered too, for he had not collected his
scattered wits. but the epanchins had not had time to get more than
twenty paces away when a scandalous episode occurred. the young officer,
evgenie pavlovitchâ€™s friend who had been conversing with aglaya, said
aloud in a great state of indignation:

â€œshe ought to be whipped--thatâ€™s the only way to deal with creatures
like that--she ought to be whipped!â€

ted with the occurrence, and talked
and laughed over it for a long time.

in a word, the incident closed as such incidents do, and the band began
to play again. the prince walked away after the epanchin party. had
he thought of looking round to the left after he had been pushed so
unceremoniously into the chair, he would have observed aglaya standing
some twenty yards away. she had stayed to watch the scandalous scene in
spite of her motherâ€™s and sistersâ€™ anxious cries to her to come away.

prince s. ran up to her and persuaded her, at last, to come home with
them.

lizabetha prokofievna saw that she returned in such a state of agitation
that it was doubtful whether she had even heard their calls. but only a
couple of minutes later, when they had reached the park, aglaya suddenly
remarked, in her usual calm, indifferent voice:

â€œi wanted to see how the farce would end.â€

iii.

the occurrence at the vauxhall had filled both mother and daughters with
something like horror. in their excite

.

in her opinion there was so much disclosed and laid bare by the episode,
that, in spite of the chaotic condition of her mind, she was able to
feel more or less decided on certain points which, up to now, had been
in a cloudy condition.

however, one and all of the party realized that something important
had happened, and that, perhaps fortunately enough, something which had
hitherto been enveloped in the obscurity of guess-work had now begun to
come forth a little from the mists. in spite of prince s.â€™s assurances
and explanations, evgenie pavlovitchâ€™s real character and position were
at last coming to light. he was publicly convicted of intimacy with
â€œthat creature.â€ so thought lizabetha prokofievna and her two elder
daughters.

but the real upshot of the business was that the number of riddles to
be solved was augmented. the two girls, though rather irritated at their
motherâ€™s exaggerated alarm and haste to depart from the scene, had been
unwilling to worry her at first with ques

tions.

besides, they could not help thinking that their sister aglaya probably
knew more about the whole matter than both they and their mother put
together.

prince s. looked as black as night, and was silent and moody. mrs.
epanchin did not say a word to him all the way home, and he did not seem
to observe the fact. adelaida tried to pump him a little by asking, â€œwho
was the uncle they were talking about, and what was it that had happened
in petersburg?â€ but he had merely muttered something disconnected about
â€œmaking inquiries,â€ and that â€œof course it was all nonsense.â€ â€œoh, of
course,â€ replied adelaida, and asked no more questions. aglaya, t

oo fast to be pleasant.â€

once she turned and observed the prince hurrying after them. noticing
his anxiety to catch them up, she smiled ironically, and then looked
back no more. at length, just as they neared the house, general epanchin
came out and met them; he had only just arrived from town.

his first word was to inquire after evgenie pavlovitch. but lizabetha
stalked past him, and neither looked at him nor answered his question.

he immediately judged from the faces of his daughters and prince s. that
there was a thunderstorm brewing, and he himself already bore evidences
of unusual perturbation of mind.

he immediately button-holed prince s., and standing at the front door,
engaged in a whispered conversation with him. by the troubled aspect of
both of them, when they entered the house, and approached mrs. epanchin,
it was evident that they had been discussing very disturbing news.

little by little the family gathered together upstairs in lizabetha

rejected, and told lizabetha.

â€œi tell you, my dear fellow, aglaya is such an extraordinary, such a
self-willed, fantastical little creature, you wouldnâ€™t believe it! every
high quality, every brilliant trait of heart and mind, are to be
found in her, and, with it all, so much caprice and mockery, such wild
fancies--indeed, a little devil! she has just been laughing at her
mother to her very face, and at her sisters, and at prince s., and
everybody--and of course she always laughs at me! you know i love the
child--i love her even when she laughs at me, and i believe the wild
little creature has a special fondness for me for that very reason. she
is fonder of me than any of the others. i dare swear she has had a
good laugh at _you_ before now! you were having a quiet talk just now, i
observed, after all the thunder and lightning upstairs. she was sitting
with you just as though there had been no row at all.â€

the note was written and folded anyhow, evidently in a great hurry, and
probably just before aglaya had come down to the verandah.

in inexpressible agitation, amounting almost to fear, the prince slipped
quickly away from the window, away from the light, like a frightened
thief, but as he did so he collided violently with some gentleman who
seemed to spring from the earth at his feet.

â€œi was watching for you, prince,â€ said the individual.

â€œis that you, keller?â€ said the prince, in surprise.

â€œyes, iâ€™ve been looking for you. i waited for you at the epanchinsâ€™
house, but of course i could not come in. i dogged you from behind

e to look

it was the first time they had met since the encounter on the staircase
at the hotel.

painfully surprised as he was at this sudden apparition of rogojin,
the prince, for some little while, was unable to collect his thoughts.
rogojin, evidently, saw and understood the impression he had made; and
though he seemed more or less confused at first, yet he began talking
with what looked like assumed ease and freedom. however, the prince soon
changed his mind on this score, and thought that there was not only no
affectation of indifference, but that rogojin was not even particularly
agitated. if there were a little apparent awkwardness, it was only in
his words and gestures. the man could not change his heart.

â€œhow did you--find me here?â€ asked the prince for the sake of saying
something.

â€œkeller told me (i found him at your place) that you were in the park.
â€˜of course he is!â€™ i thought.â€

â€œwhy so?â€ asked the pri

â€œso you counted the minutes while i slept, did you, evgenie pavlovitch?â€
 he said, ironically. â€œyou have not taken your eyes off me all the

been dreaming about him, prince,â€ he added, frowning. â€œyes, by the by,â€
 starting up, â€œwhereâ€™s the orator? whereâ€™s lebedeff? has he finished?
what did he talk about? is it true, prince, that you once declared that

saves the world! and i declare that he only has such playful ideas
because heâ€™s in love! gentlemen, the prince is in love. i guessed it the
moment he came in. donâ€™t blush, prince; you make me sorry for you. what
beauty saves the world? colia told me that you are a zealous christian;
is it so? colia says you call yourself a christian.â€

the prince regarded him attentively, but said nothing.

rage. â€œi wonâ€™t, i wonâ€™t be made to blush every minute by them all! i

with anger--â€œand if you donâ€™t agree i shall go and marry gavrila

goodness knows what.â€

â€œare you out of your mind?â€ cried the prince, almost starting from his
seat. â€œwhat do they accuse you of? who accuses you?â€

â€œat home, everybody, mother, my sisters, prince s., even that detestable
colia! if they donâ€™t say it, they think it. i told them all so to their
faces. i told mother and father and everybody. mamma was ill all the
day after it, and next day father and alexandra told me that i didnâ€™t
understand what nonsense i was talking. i informed them that they

language--that i had read a couple of paul de kokâ€™s novels two years
since on purpose, so as to know all about everything.

the prince was startled, and reflected for a moment.

â€œit is not true,â€ he repeated, decidedly; â€œyou have just invented it!â€

â€œyou are wonderfully polite. you know he is greatly improved. he loves
me better than his life. he let his hand burn before my very eyes in
order to prove to me that he loved me better than his life!â€

â€œhe burned his hand!â€

â€œyes, believe it or not! itâ€™s all the same to me!â€

the prince sat silent once more. aglaya did not seem to be joking; she
was too angry for that.

â€œwhat! he brought a candle with him to this place? that is, if the
episode happened here; otherwise i canâ€™t.â€

â€œyes, a candle! whatâ€™s there improbable about that?â€

â€œa whole one, and in a candlestick?â€

â€œyes--no-half a candle--an end, you know--no, it was a whole candle;
itâ€™s all the same. be quiet, canâ€™t you! he brought a box of matches too,
if you like, and then lighted the candle and held

blushed dreadfully.) â€œthen she returned to rogojin again, who loves
her like a madman. then you--like a wise man as you are--came back here
after her as soon as ever you heard that she had returned to petersburg.
yesterday evening you sprang forward to protect her, and just now you
dreamed about her. you see, i know all. you did come back here for her,
for her--now didnâ€™t you?â€

â€œyes--for her!â€ said the prince softly and sadly, and bending his head
down, quite unconscious of the fact that aglaya was gazing at him with
eyes which burned like live coals. â€œi came to find out something--i
donâ€™t believe in her future happiness as rogojinâ€™s wife, although--in a
word, i did not know how to help her or what to do for her--but i came,
on the chance.â€

he glanced at aglaya, who was listening with a look of hatred on her
face.

â€œif you came without knowing why, i suppose you love her very much
indeed!â€

 her writing you any more letters.â€

â€œif so, you are a heartless man!â€ cried aglaya. â€œas if you canâ€™t see that
it is not myself she loves, but you, you, and only you! surely you have
not remarked everything else in her, and only not _this?_ do you know what
these letters mean? they mean jealousy, sir--nothing but pure jealousy!
she--do you think she will ever really marry this rogojin, as she says
here she will? she would take her own life the day after you and i were
married.â€

the prince shuddered; his heart seemed to freeze within him. he gazed
at aglaya in wonderment; it was difficult for him to realize that this
child was also a woman.

â€œgod knows, aglaya, that to restore her peace of mind and make her happy
i would willingly give up my life. but i cannot love her, and she knows
that.â€

â€œoh, make a sacrifice of yourself! that sort of thing becomes you well,
you know. why not do it? and donâ€™t call me â€˜aglayaâ€™; you have done it

this agitated the old lady considerably; and she awoke her other
daughters. next, she learned from the maid that aglaya had gone into
the park before seven oâ€™clock. the sisters made a joke of aglayaâ€™s last
freak, and told their mother that if she went into the park to look
for her, aglaya would probably be very angry with her, and that she was
pretty sure to be sitting reading on the green bench that she had talked
of two or three days since, and about which she had nearly quarrelled
with prince s., who did not see anything particularly lovely in it.

arrived at the rendezvous of the prince and her daughter, and hearing
the strange words of the latter, lizabetha prokofievna had been
dreadfully alarmed, for many reasons. however, now that she had dragged
the prince home with her, she began to feel a little frightened at what
she had undertaken. why should not aglaya meet the prince in the
park and have a talk with him, even if such a meeting should be by
appointment?

ht, â€œthe vauxhall! they wonâ€™t be there today, of course!â€
 at this moment he noticed that he was close to their house; he had felt
that he must gravitate to this spot eventually, and, with a beating
heart, he mounted the verandah steps.

no one met him; the verandah was empty, and nearly pitch dark. he opened
the door into the room, but it, too, was dark and empty. he stood in the
middle of the room in perplexity. suddenly the door opened, and in came
alexandra, candle in hand. seeing the prince she stopped before him in
surprise, looking at him questioningly.

it was clear that she had been merely passing through the room from door
to door, and had not had the remotest notion that she would meet anyone.

â€œhow did you come here?â€ she asked, at last.

â€œi--i--came in--â€

â€œmamma is not very well, nor is aglaya. adelaida has gone to bed, and
i am just going. we were alone the whole evening. father and prince s.
have gone to town.â€

â€œi have come to you--now--to--â€

at the pub close by here, and quarrel in the street on the way home, and
embrace one another after it, and donâ€™t seem to part for a moment.â€

when the prince pointed out that there was nothing new about that, for
that they had always behaved in this manner together, colia did not know
what to say; in fact he could not explain what it was that specially
worried him, just now, about his father.

on the morning following the bacchanalian songs and quarrels recorded
above, as the prince stepped out of the house at about eleven oâ€™clock,
the general suddenly appeared before him, much agitated.

â€œi have long sought the honour and opportunity of meeting
you--much-esteemed lef nicolaievitch,â€ he murmured, pressing the
princeâ€™s hand very hard, almost painfully so; â€œlong--very long.â€

the prince begged him to step in and sit down.

â€œno--i will not sit down,--i am keeping you, i see,--another time!--i
think i may be permitted to congratulate you upon the realization of

_he_ doesnâ€™t understand me, he is absolutely--_absolutely_ unable to

the prince was rather alarmed at all this, and was obliged to end by
appointing the same hour of the following day for the interview desired.
the general left him much comforted and far less agitated than when he
had arrived.

at seven in the evening, the prince sent to request lebedeff to pay
him a visit. lebedeff came at once, and â€œesteemed it an honour,â€ as he
observed, the instant he entered the room. he acted as though there
had never been the slightest suspicion of the fact that he had
systematically avoided the prince for the last three days.

he sat down on the edge of his chair, smiling and making faces,
and rubbing his hands, and looking as though he were in delighted
expectation of hearing some important communication, which had been long

 general most impatiently.

iv.

the time appointed was twelve oâ€™clock, and the prince, returning home
unexpectedly late, found the general waiting for him. at the first
glance, he saw that the latter was displeased, perhaps because he had
been kept waiting. the prince apologized, and quickly took a seat. he
seemed strangely timid before the general this morning, for some reason,
and felt as though his visitor were some piece of china which he was
afraid of breaking.

on scrutinizing him, the prince soon saw that the general was quite a
different man from what he had been the day before; he looked like one
who had come to some momentous resolve. his calmness, however, was more
apparent than real. he was courteous, but there was a suggestion of
injured innocence in his manner.

â€œiâ€™ve brought your book back,â€ he began, indicating a book lying on the
table. â€œmuch obliged to you for lending it to me.â€

â€œah, yes. well, did you read it, general? itâ€™s curious, isnâ€™t it?â€ said
the p

pardonable mistake. â€œfirst of all, this prince is
an idiot, and, secondly, he is a fool--knows nothing of the world, and
has no place in it. whom can he be shown to? where can you take him to?
what will old bielokonski say? we never thought of such a husband as
_that_ for our aglaya!â€

of course, the last argument was the chief one. the maternal heart
trembled with indignation to think of such an absurdity, although in
that heart there rose another voice, which said: â€œand _why_ is not the
prince such a husband as you would have desired for aglaya?â€ it was this
voice which annoyed lizabetha prokofievna more than anything else.

for some reason or other, the sisters liked the idea of the prince. they
did not even consider it very strange; in a word, they might be expected
at any moment to range themselves strongly on his side. but both of them
decided to say nothing either way. it had always been noticed in the
family that the stronger mrs. epanchinâ€™s opposition was to any project,

as just a hedgehog, which meant
nothing--unless, indeed, it was a pledge of friendship,--the sign of
forgetting of offences and so on. at all events, it was a joke, and, of
course, a most pardonable and innocent one.

we may as well remark that the general had guessed perfectly accurately.

the prince, returning home from the interview with aglaya, had sat
gloomy and depressed for half an hour. he was almost in despair when
colia arrived with the hedgehog.

then the sky cleared in a moment. the prince seemed to arise from the
dead; he asked colia all about it, made him repeat the story over and
over again, and laughed and shook hands with the boys in his delight.

it seemed clear to the prince that aglaya forgave him, and that he might
go there again this very evening; and in his eyes that was not only the
main thing, but everything in the world.

â€œwhat children we are still, colia!â€ he cried at last,
enthusiastically,--â€œand how delightful it is that we can be children
still!â€

â€œsimpl

t of aglaya.

lizabetha prokofievna went to bed and only rose again in time for tea,
when the prince might be expected.

she awaited him in trembling agitation; and when he at last arrived she
nearly went off into hysterics.

muishkin himself came in very timidly. he seemed to feel his way, and
looked in each personâ€™s eyes in a questioning way,--for aglaya was
absent, which fact alarmed him at once.

this evening there were no strangers present--no one but the immediate
members of the family. prince s. was still in town, occupied with the
affairs of evgenie pavlovitchâ€™s uncle.

â€œi wish at least _he_ would come and say something!â€ complained poor
lizabetha prokofievna.

the general sat still with a most preoccupied air. the sisters were
looking very serious and did not speak a word, and lizabetha prokofievna
did not know how to commence the conversation.

at length she plunged into an energetic and hostile criticism of
railways, and glared at the prince defiantly.

he paused, breathless.

â€œcome--you havenâ€™t told us much!â€ said aglaya, after waiting some five
seconds. â€œvery well, i am ready to drop the hedgehog, if you like; but
i am anxious to be able to clear up this accumulation of
misunderstandings. allow me to ask you, prince,--i wish to hear from
you, personally--are you making me an offer, or not?â€

â€œgracious heavens!â€ exclaimed lizabetha prokofievna. the prince started.
the general stiffened in his chair; the sisters frowned.

â€œdonâ€™t deceive me now, prince--tell the truth. all these people
persecute me with astounding questions--about you. is there any ground
for all these questions, or not? come!â€

â€œi have not asked you to marry me yet, aglaya ivanovna,â€ said the
prince, becoming suddenly animated; â€œbut you know yourself how much i
love you and trust you.â€

â€œno--i asked you this--answer this! do you intend to ask for my hand, or
not?â€

it would be difficult to describe the animation and high spirits which
distinguished the prince for the rest of the evening.

he was so happy that â€œit made one feel happy to look at him,â€ as
aglayaâ€™s sisters expressed it afterwards. he talked, and told stories
just as he had done once before, and never since, namely on the very
first morning of his acquaintance with the epanchins, six months ago.
since his return to petersburg from moscow, he had been remarkably
silent, and had told prince s. on one occasion, before everyone, that he
did not think himself justified in degrading any thought by his unworthy
words.

but this evening he did nearly all the talking himself, and told stories
by the dozen, while he answered all questions put to him clearly,
gladly, and with any amount of detail.

there was nothing, however, of love-making in his talk. his ideas were
all of the most serious kind; some were even mystical and profound.

he aired his own views on various matters, some of his mo

ow,â€ aglaya said to him once, interrupting the reading, â€œiâ€™ve
remarked that you are dreadfully badly educated. you never know anything
thoroughly, if one asks you; neither anyoneâ€™s name, nor dates, nor about
treaties and so on. itâ€™s a great pity, you know!â€

â€œi told you i had not had much of an education,â€ replied the prince.

â€œhow am i to respect you, if thatâ€™s the case? read on now. no--donâ€™t!
stop reading!â€

and once more, that same evening, aglaya mystified them all. prince s.
had returned, and aglaya was particularly amiable to him, and asked a
great deal after evgenie pavlovitch. (muishkin had not come in as yet.)

suddenly prince s. hinted something about â€œa new and approaching
change in the family.â€ he was led to this remark by a communication
inadvertently made to him by lizabetha prokofievna, that adelaidaâ€™s
marriage must be postponed a little longer, in order that the two
weddings might come off together.

lared up, and
said some indignant words about â€œall these silly insinuations.â€
 she added that â€œshe had no intentions as yet of replacing anybodyâ€™s
mistress.â€

these words painfully impressed the whole party; but especially her
parents. lizabetha prokofievna summoned a secret council of two, and
insisted upon the generalâ€™s demanding from the prince a full explanation
of his relations with nastasia philipovna. the general argued that it
was only a whim of aglayaâ€™s; and that, had not prince s. unfortunately
made that remark, which had confused the child and made her blush, she
never would have said what she did; and that he was sure aglaya knew
well that anything she might have heard of the prince and nastasia
philipovna was merely the fabrication of malicious tongues, and that
the woman was going to marry rogojin. he insisted that the prince had
nothing whatever to do with nastasia philipovna, so far as any liaison
was concerned; and, if the truth were to be told about it, he added,

nnectedly and endlessly, as was his wont.

â€œyou wouldnâ€™t believe,â€ he concluded, â€œhow irritating they all are
there. they are such wretchedly small, vain, egotistical, _commonplace_
people! would you believe it, they invited me there under the express
condition that i should die quickly, and they are all as wild as
possible with me for not having died yet, and for being, on the
contrary, a good deal better! isnâ€™t it a comedy? i donâ€™t mind betting
that you donâ€™t believe me!â€

the prince said nothing.

â€œi sometimes think of coming over to you again,â€ said hippolyte,
carelessly. â€œso you _donâ€™t_ think them capable of inviting a man on
the condition that he is to look sharp and die?â€

â€œi certainly thought they invited you with quite other views.â€

â€œho, ho! you are not nearly so simple as they try to make you out! this
is not the time for it, or i would tell you a thing or two about that
beauty, gania, and his hopes. you are being undermined, pitilessly

their minds. why are you so glad that evgenie pavlovitch is coming?â€

â€œlisten to me, aglaya,â€ said the prince, â€œi do believe you are nervous
lest i shall make a fool of myself tomorrow at your party?â€

â€œnervous about you?â€ aglaya blushed. â€œwhy should i be nervous about
you? what would it matter to me if you were to make ever such a fool of
yourself? how can you say such a thing? what do you mean by â€˜making a

represented by the letter a.--â€

â€œwhat? impossible! to nastasia philipovna? nonsense!â€ cried the prince.

â€œit was, i assure you, and if not to her then to rogojin, which is
the same thing. mr. hippolyte has had letters, too, and all from the
individual whose name begins with an a.,â€ smirked lebedeff, with a
hideous grin.

as he kept jumping from subject to subject, and forgetting what he had
begun to talk about, the prince said nothing, but waited, to give him
time.

it was all very vague. who had taken the letters, if letters there were?
probably vera--and how could lebedeff have got them? in all probability,
he had managed to steal the present letter from vera, and had himself
gone over to lizabetha prokofievna with some idea in his head. so the
prince concluded at last.

â€œyou are mad!â€ he cried, indignantly.

â€œnot quite, esteemed prince,â€ replied lebedeff, with some acerbity. â€œi
confess i thought of doi

 inquired the prince.

â€œno--oh no, fresher--more the correct card. i only became this like
after the humiliation i suffered there,

â€œwell--thatâ€™ll do; now leave me.â€

this injunction had to be repeated several times before the man could be
persuaded to move. even then he turned back at the door, came as far as
the middle of the room, and there went through his mysterious motions
designed to convey the suggestion that the prince should open the
letter. he did not dare put his suggestion into words again.

after this performance, he smiled sweetly and left the room on tiptoe.

all this had been very painful to listen to. one fact stood out certain
and clear, and that was that poor aglaya must be in a state of great
distress and indecision and mental torment (â€œfrom jealousy,â€ the prince
whispered to himself). undoubtedly in this inexperienced, but hot and
proud little head, there were all sorts of plans forming, wild an

gania.

however, he made up his mind that he would himself take the note and
deliver it. indeed, he went so far as to leave the house and walk up the
road, but changed his mind when he had nearly reached ptitsinâ€™s door.
however, he there luckily met colia, and commissioned him to deliver the
letter to his brother as if direct from aglaya. colia asked no questions
but simply delivered it, and gania consequently had no suspicion that it
had passed through so many hands.

arrived home again, the prince sent for vera lebedeff and told her as
much as was necessary, in order to relieve her mind, for she had been in
a dreadful state of anxiety since she had missed the letter. she heard
with horror that her father had taken it. muishkin learned from her that
she had on several occasions performed secret missions both for aglaya
and for rogojin, without, however, having had the slightest idea that in
so doing she might injure the prince in any way.

the latter, with one thing and another, was now so d

as in an almost
hysterical state; he cried continuously, but was running about all day,
all the same; fetching doctors, of whom he collected three; going to the
chemistâ€™s, and so on.

the general was brought round to some extent, but the doctors
declared that he could not be said to be out of danger. varia and nina
alexandrovna never left the sick manâ€™s bedside; gania was excited and
distressed, but would not go upstairs, and seemed afraid to look at the
patient. he wrung his hands when the prince spoke to him, and said that
â€œsuch a misfortune at such a momentâ€ was terrible.

the prince thought he knew what gania meant by â€œsuch a moment.â€

hippolyte was not in the house. lebedeff turned up late in the
afternoon; he had been asleep ever since his interview with the prince
in the morning. he was quite sober now, and cried with real sincerity
over the sick general--mourning for him as though he were his own
brother. he blamed himself aloud, but did not explain why. he repeated
over and

nt, of the english
aristocracy, and some of their tastes (especially in the matter of
under-done roast beef, harness, men-servants, etc.). he was a great
friend of the dignitaryâ€™s, and lizabetha prokofievna, for some reason or
other, had got hold of the idea that this worthy intended at no distant
date to offer the advantages of his hand and heart to alexandra.

besides the elevated and more solid individuals enumerated, there were
present a few younger though not less elegant guests. besides prince s.
and evgenie pavlovitch, we must name the eminent and fascinating prince
n.--once the vanquisher of female hearts all over europe. this gentleman
was no longer in the first bloom of youth--he was forty-five, but still
very handsome. he was well off, and lived, as a rule, abroad, and was
noted as a good teller of stories. then came a few guests belonging to
a lower stratum of society--people who, like the epanchins themselves,
moved only occasionally in this exalted sphere. the epanchins liked to

prince.

â€œoh! i didnâ€™t say it because i _doubt_ the fact, you know. (ha, ha.)
how could i doubt such a thing? (ha, ha, ha.) i made the remark
because--because nicolai andreevitch pavlicheff was such a splendid man,
donâ€™t you see! such a high-souled man, he really was, i assure you.â€

the prince did not exactly pant for breath, but he â€œseemed almost
to _choke_ out of pure simplicity and goodness of heart,â€ as adelaida
expressed it, on talking the party over with her fiance, the prince s.,
next morning.

â€œbut, my goodness me,â€ laughed ivan petrovitch, â€œwhy canâ€™t i be cousin
to even a splendid man?â€

â€œoh, dear!â€ cried the prince, confused, trying to hurry his words
out, and growing more and more eager every moment: â€œiâ€™ve gone and said
another stupid thing. i donâ€™t know what to say. i--i didnâ€™t mean that,
you know--i--i--he really was such a splendid man, wasnâ€™t he?â€

the prince trembled all over. why was he so agitated? why had he flown

oy and emotion consistent with the occasion. why
this was it would be difficult to say.

he seemed to feel warmly and deeply grateful to someone for something or
other--perhaps to ivan petrovitch; but likely enough to all the guests,
individually, and collectively. he was much too happy.

ivan petrovitch began to stare at him with some surprise; the dignitary,
too, looked at him with considerable attention; princess bielokonski
glared at him angrily, and compressed her lips. prince n., evgenie,
prince s., and the girls, all broke off their own conversations and
listened. aglaya seemed a little startled; as for lizabetha prokofievna,
her heart sank within her.

this was odd of lizabetha prokofievna and her daughters. they had
themselves decided that it would be better if the prince did not talk
all the evening. yet seeing him sitting silent and alone, but perfectly
happy, they had been on the point of exerting themselves to draw him
into one of the groups of talkers around the room. now that he

but his own cursed sickly suspicion. his face lighted up with
joy when, at about two oâ€™clock, he espied the epanchins coming along to
pay him a short visit, â€œjust for a minute.â€ they really had only come
for a minute.

lizabetha prokofievna had announced, directly after lunch, that they
would all take a walk together. the information was given in the form of
a command, without explanation, drily and abruptly. all had issued forth
in obedience to the mandate; that is, the girls, mamma, and prince s.
lizabetha prokofievna went off in a direction exactly contrary to the
usual one, and all understood very well what she was driving at, but
held their peace, fearing to irritate the good lady. she, as though
anxious to avoid any conversation, walked ahead, silent and alone. at
last adelaida remarked that it was no use racing along at such a pace,
and that she could not keep up with her mother.

â€œlook here,â€ said lizabetha prokofievna, turning round suddenly; â€œwe are
passing his house. what

ee you are tremendously amused, at this
moment! probably you are laughing at me and fitting those silly lines to
my case--

â€œâ€˜maybe sad love upon his setting smiles, and with vain hopes his
farewell hour beguiles.

â€œha, ha, ha!â€

hippolyte suddenly burst into a fit of hysterical laughter, which turned
into a choking cough.

â€œobserve,â€ he gasped, through his coughing, â€œwhat a fellow gania is!
he talks about nastasiaâ€™s â€˜leavings,â€™ but what does he want to take
himself?â€

the prince sat silent for a long while. his mind was filled with dread
and horror.

â€œyou spoke of a meeting with nastasia philipovna,â€ he said at last, in a
low voice.

â€œoh--come! surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today
between nastasia and aglaya ivanovna, and that nastasia has been sent
for on purpose, through rogojin, from st. petersburg? it has been
brought about by invitation of aglaya ivanovna and my own efforts, and
nastasia is at this moment with rogojin, not far from here--at

asia wished for a speedy marriage, true!--but the
prince agreed at once to her proposals; he agreed, in fact, so casually
that anyone might suppose he was but acceding to the most simple and
ordinary suggestion.

there are many strange circumstances such as this before us; but in
our opinion they do but deepen the mystery, and do not in the smallest
degree help us to understand the case.

however, let us take one more example. thus, we know for a fact that
during the whole of this fortnight the prince spent all his days and
evenings with nastasia; he walked with her, drove with her; he began to
be restless whenever he passed an hour without seeing her--in fact,
to all appearances, he sincerely loved her. he would listen to her for
hours at a time with a quiet smile on his face, scarcely saying a word
himself. and yet we know, equally certainly, that during this period he
several times set off, suddenly, to the epanchinsâ€™, not concealing
the fact from nastasia philipovna, and driving the latte

mself,--who began
to intrigue against him out of pure irritation;--but of this anon. in
fact we are in full accord with certain forcible words spoken to the
prince by evgenie pavlovitch, quite unceremoniously, during the course
of a friendly conversation, six or seven days after the events at
nastasia philipovnaâ€™s house.

we may remark here that not only the epanchins themselves, but all who
had anything to do with them, thought it right to break with the prince
in consequence of his conduct. prince s. even went so far as to turn
away and cut him dead in the street. but evgenie pavlovitch was not
afraid to compromise himself by paying the prince a visit, and did so,
in spite of the fact that he had recommenced to visit at the epanchinsâ€™,
where he was received with redoubled hospitality and kindness after the
temporary estrangement.

evgenie called upon the prince the day after that on which the epanchins
left pavlofsk. he knew of all the current rumours,--in fact, he had
probably contribute

to high fever; that now she was
better and out of serious danger, but still in a nervous, hysterical
state.

â€œitâ€™s a good thing that there is peace in the house, at all events,â€ he
continued. â€œthey never utter a hint about the past, not only in aglayaâ€™s
presence, but even among themselves. the old people are talking of a
trip abroad in the autumn, immediately after adelaidaâ€™s wedding; aglaya
received the news in silence.â€

evgenie himself was very likely going abroad also; so were prince s.
and his wife, if affairs allowed of it; the general was to stay at home.
they were all at their estate of colmina now, about twenty miles or so
from st. petersburg. princess bielokonski had not returned to moscow
yet, and was apparently staying on for reasons of her own. lizabetha
prokofievna had insisted that it was quite impossible to remain in
pavlofsk after what had happened. evgenie had told her of all the
rumours current in town about the affair; so that there could be no talk
of their go

d allow them to use any
more pronounced means.

we have observed before that even some of the princeâ€™s nearest
neighbours had begun to oppose him. vera lebedeffâ€™s passive disagreement
was limited to the shedding of a few solitary tears; to more frequent
sitting alone at home, and to a diminished frequency in her visits to
the princeâ€™s apartments.

colia was occupied with his father at this time. the old man died during
a second stroke, which took place just eight days after the first. the
prince showed great sympathy in the grief of the family, and during the
first days of their mourning he was at the house a great deal with nina
alexandrovna. he went to the funeral, and it was observable that the
public assembled in church greeted his arrival and departure with
whisperings, and watched him closely.

the same thing happened in the park and in the street, wherever he went.
he was pointed out when he drove by, and he often overheard the name of
nastasia philipovna coupled with his own as he

ome unknown reason had become simple
lebedeff. he then proceeded to explain his whole game to the prince,
interesting the latter exceedingly.

according to lebedeffâ€™s account, he had first tried what he could do
with general epanchin. the latter informed him that he wished well to
the unfortunate young man, and would gladly do what he could to â€œsave
him,â€ but that he did not think it would be seemly for him to interfere
in this matter. lizabetha prokofievna would neither hear nor see him.
prince s. and evgenie pavlovitch only shrugged their shoulders, and
implied that it was no business of theirs. however, lebedeff had not
lost heart, and went off to a clever lawyer,--a worthy and respectable
man, whom he knew well. this old gentleman informed him that the thing
was perfectly feasible if he could get hold of competent witnesses as
to muishkinâ€™s mental incapacity. then, with the assistance of a few
influential persons, he would soon see the matter arranged.

lebedeff immediately procured
 
 ___________________________
 
 the services of an old doctor, and carried
the latter away to pavlofsk to see the prince, by way of viewing the
ground, as it were, and to give him (lebedeff) counsel as to whether
the thing was to be done or not. the visit was not to be official, but
merely friendly.

muishkin remembered the doctorâ€™s visit quite well. he remembered that
lebedeff had said that he looked ill, and had better see a doctor; and
although the prince scouted the idea, lebedeff had turned up almost
immediately with his old friend, explaining that they had just met at
the bedside of hippolyte, who was very ill, and that the doctor had
something to tell the prince about the sick man.

the prince had, of course, at once received him, and had plunged into
a conversation about hippolyte. he had given the doctor an account of
hippolyteâ€™s attempted suicide; and had proceeded thereafter to talk of
his own malady,--of switzerland, of schneider, and so

â€™s last idea which upset him.

â€œwhat i am really alarmed about, though,â€ he said, â€œis aglaya ivanovna.
rogojin knows how you love her. love for love. you took nastasia
philipovna from him. he will murder aglaya ivanovna; for though she is
not yours, of course, now, still such an act would pain you,--wouldnâ€™t
it?â€

he had attained his end. the prince left the house beside himself with
terror.

these warnings about rogojin were expressed on the day before the
wedding. that evening the prince saw nastasia philipovna for the last
time before they were to meet at the altar; but nastasia was not in a
position to give him any comfort or consolation. on the contrary, she
only added to his mental perturbation as the evening went on. up to this
time she had invariably done her best to cheer him--she was afraid of
his looking melancholy; she would try singing to him, and telling him
every sort of funny story or reminiscence that she could recall. the
prince nearly always pretended to be amused

alexeyevna, the ptitsins, gania, and the doctor. when the prince
asked lebedeff why he had invited the doctor, who was almost a stranger,
lebedeff replied:

â€œwhy, he wears an â€˜order,â€™ and it looks so well!â€

this idea amused the prince.

keller and burdovsky looked wonderfully correct in their dress-coats and
white kid gloves, although keller caused the bridegroom some alarm by
his undisguisedly hostile glances at the gathering crowd of sight-seers
outside.

at about half-past seven the prince started for the church in his
carriage.

we may remark here that he seemed anxious not to omit a single one of
the recognized customs and traditions observed at weddings. he wished
all to be done as openly as possible, and â€œin due order.â€

arrived at the church, muishkin, under kellerâ€™s guidance, passed
through the crowd of spectators, amid continuous whispering and excited
exclamations. the prince stayed near the altar, while keller made off
once more to fetch the bride.

on reaching the ga

t of his intentions when they
said good-bye, but had hidden them even from him. soon there was hardly
anyone left in the house. burdovsky had gone to see hippolyte; keller
and lebedeff had wandered off together somewhere.

only vera lebedeff remained hurriedly rearranging the furniture in
the rooms. as she left the verandah, she glanced at the prince. he was
seated at the table, with both elbows upon it, and his head resting
on his hands. she approached him, and touched his shoulder gently.
the prince started and looked at her in perplexity; he seemed to be
collecting his senses for a minute or so, before he could remember where
he was. as recollection dawned upon him, he became violently agitated.
all he did, however, was to ask vera very earnestly to knock at his door
and awake him in time for the first train to petersburg next morning.
vera promised, and the prince entreated her not to tell anyone of his
intention. she promised this, too; and at last, when she had half-closed
the door, he ca

side, walking up and down in anguish of soul for half an hour or so in
the stifling heat. nothing stirred; the blinds were motionless; indeed,
the prince began to think that the apparition of rogojinâ€™s face could
have been nothing but fancy. soothed by this thought, he drove off once
more to his friends at the ismailofsky barracks. he was expected
there. the mother had already been to three or four places to look for
nastasia, but had not found a trace of any kind.

the prince said nothing, but entered the room, sat down silently, and
stared at them, one after the other, with the air of a man who cannot
understand what is being said to him. it was strange--one moment he
seemed to be so observant, the next so absent; his behaviour struck
all the family as most remarkable. at length he rose from his seat, and
begged to be shown nastasiaâ€™s rooms. the ladies reported afterwards how
he had examined everything in the apartments. he observed an open book

pped and looked at him; then reflected, and replied as though
he had not heard the question:

â€œlook here, lef nicolaievitch, you go straight on to the house; i shall
walk on the other side. see that we keep together.â€

so saying, rogojin crossed the road.

arrived on the opposite pavement, he looked back to see whether the
prince were moving, waved his hand in the direction of the gorohovaya,
and strode on, looking across every moment to see whether muishkin
understood his instructions. the prince supposed that rogojin desired to
look out for someone whom he was afraid to miss; but if so, why had he
not told _him_ whom to look out for? so the two proceeded for half a mile
or so. suddenly the prince began to tremble from some unknown cause. he
could not bear it, and signalled to rogojin across the road.

the latter came at once.

â€œis nastasia philipovna at your house?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œand was it you looked out of the window under the blind this morning?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œthen why did--â

icent white silk dress, bits
of lace, ribbons and flowers. on a small table at the bedside glittered
a mass of diamonds, torn off and thrown down anyhow. from under a heap
of lace at the end of the bed peeped a small white foot, which looked as
though it had been chiselled out of marble; it was terribly still.

the prince gazed and gazed, and felt that the more he gazed the more
death-like became the silence. suddenly a fly awoke somewhere, buzzed
across the room, and settled on the pillow. the prince shuddered.

â€œletâ€™s go,â€ said rogojin, touching his shoulder. they left the alcove
and sat down in the two chairs they had occupied before, opposite to one
another. the prince trembled more and more violently, and never took his
questioning eyes off rogojinâ€™s face.

â€œi see you are shuddering, lef nicolaievitch,â€ said the latter, at
length, â€œalmost as you did once in moscow, before your fit; donâ€™t you
remember? i donâ€™t know what i shall do with you--â€

the prince bent forward to

â€œwait a bit--iâ€™ll make the bed, and you can lie down. iâ€™ll lie down,
too, and weâ€™ll listen and watch, for i donâ€™t know yet what i shall do...
i tell you beforehand, so that you may be ready in case i--â€

muttering these disconnected words, rogojin began to make up the beds.
it was clear that he had devised these beds long before; last night he
slept on the sofa. but there was no room for two on the sofa, and he
seemed anxious that he and the prince should be close to one another;
therefore, he now dragged cushions of all sizes and shapes from the
sofas, and made a sort of bed of them close by the curtain. he then
approached the prince, and gently helped him to rise, and led him
towards the bed. but the prince could now walk by himself, so that his
fear must have passed; for all that, however, he continued to shudder.

cushions beside muishkin, â€œand, naturally, ther

ling weighed on his heart; he had
suddenly realized that not only at this moment, but for a long while,
he had not been saying what he wanted to say, had not been acting as he
wanted to act; and that these cards which he held in his hand, and which
he had been so delighted to have at first, were now of no use--no use...
he rose, and wrung his hands. rogojin lay motionless, and seemed neither
to hear nor see his movements; but his eyes blazed in the darkness, and
were fixed in a wild stare.

the prince sat down on a chair, and watched him in alarm. half an hour
went by.

suddenly rogojin burst into a loud abrupt laugh, as though he had quite
forgotten that they must speak in whispers.

â€œthat officer, eh!--that young officer--donâ€™t you remember that fellow
at the band? eh? ha, ha, ha! didnâ€™t she whip him smartly, eh?â€

the prince jumped up from his seat in renewed terror. when rogojin
quieted down (which he did at once) the prince bent over him, sat down
beside him, and with painfully bea

seemed to have forgotten all about him. the prince watched and waited.
time went on--it began to grow light.

rogojin began to wander--muttering disconnectedly; then he took to
shouting and laughing. the prince stretched out a trembling hand and
gently stroked his hair and his cheeks--he could do nothing more. his
legs trembled again and he seemed to have lost the use of them. a
new sensation came over him, filling his heart and soul with infinite
anguish.

meanwhile the daylight grew full and strong; and at last the prince
lay down, as though overcome by despair, and laid his face against the
white, motionless face of rogojin. his tears flowed on to rogojinâ€™s
cheek, though he was perhaps not aware of

chment to a certain polish count, an exile, she had suddenly
married him, quite against the wishes of her parents, though they had
eventually given their consent through fear of a terrible scandal.
then, after a six monthsâ€™ silence, evgenie pavlovitch informed his
correspondent, in a long letter, full of detail, that while paying his
last visit to dr. schneiderâ€™s establishment, he had there come across
the whole epanchin family (excepting the general, who had remained in
st. petersburg) and prince s. the meeting was a strange one. they
all received evgenie pavlovitch with effusive delight; adelaida and
alexandra were deeply grateful to him for his â€œangelic kindness to the
unhappy prince.â€

lizabetha prokofievna, when she saw poor muishkin, in his enfeebled and
humiliated condition, had wept bitterly. apparently all was forgiven
him.

prince s. had made a few just and sensible remarks. it seemed to evgenie
pavlovitch that there was not yet perfect harmony between adelaida and

that, even before marrying him, she joined a committee that had been
organized abroad to work for the restoration of poland; and further,
she visited the confessional of a celebrated jesuit priest, who made an
absolute fanatic of her. the supposed fortune of the count had dwindled
to a mere nothing, although he had given almost irrefutable evidence of
its existence to lizabetha prokofievna and prince s.

besides this, before they had been married half a year, the count and
his friend the priest managed to bring about a quarrel between aglaya
and her family, so that it was now several months since they had seen
her. in a word, there was a great deal to say; but mrs. epanchin, and
her daughters, and even prince s., were still so much distressed by
aglayaâ€™s latest infatuations and adventures, that they did not care to
talk of them, though they must have known that evgenie knew much of the
