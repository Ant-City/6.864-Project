there was me, that is alex, and my three droogs, that is pete, georgie, and dim. dim being really dim, and we sat in the korova milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening, a flip dark chill winter bastard though dry. the korova milkbar was a milk-plus mesto, and you may, o my brothers, have forgotten what these mestos were like, things changing so skorry these days and everybody very quick to forget, newspapers not being read much neither. well, what they sold there was milk plus something else. they had no licence for selling liquor, but there was no la

the four of us were dressed in the height of fashion, which in those days was a pair of black very tight tights with the old jelly mould, as we called it, fitting on the crotch underneath the tights, this being to protect and also a sort of a design you could viddy clear enough in a certain light, so that i had one in the shape of a spider, pete had a rooker (a hand, that is), georgie had a very fancy one of a flower, and poor old dim had a very hound-and-horny one of a clown’s litso (face, that is). dim not ever having much of an idea of things and being, beyond all shadow of a doubting thomas, the dimmest of we four. then we wore waisty jackets without lapels but with these very big built-up shoulders (‘pletchoes’ we called them) which were a kind of a mockery of having real shoulders like that. then, my brothers, we had these off-white cravats which looked like whipped-up kartoffel or spud with a sort of a design ma

“yes,” i said. “it would interest me greatly, brother, if you would kindly allow me to see what books those are that you have under your arm. i like nothing better in this world than a good clean book, brother.”

“clean,” he said. “clean, eh?” and then pete skvatted these three books from him and handed them round real skorry.

being three, we all had one each to viddy at except for dim. the one i had was called ‘elementary crystallography,’ so i opened it up and said: “excellent, really first-class,” keeping turning the pages. then i said in a very shocked type goloss: “but what is this here? what is this filthy slovo? i blush to look at this word. you disappoint me, brother, you do really.”

“but,” he tried, “but, but.”

“now,” said georgie, “here is what i should call real dirt. there’s one slovo beginning with an f and another with a c.” h

“an old man of your age, brother,” i said, and i started to rip up the book i’d got, and the others did the same with the ones they had. dim and pete doing a tug-of-war with ‘the rhombohedral system.’ the starry prof type began to creech: “but those are not mine, those are the property of the municipality, this is sheer wantonness and vandal work,” or some such slovos. and he tried to sort of wrest the books back off of us, which was like pathetic. “you deserve to be taught a lesson, brother,” i said, “that you do.” this crystal book i had was very tough-bound and hard to razrez to bits, being real starry and made in

“you naughty old veck, you,” i said, and then we began to filly about with him. pete held his rookers and georgie sort of hooked his rot wide open for him and dim yanked out his false zoobies, upper and lower. he threw these down on the pavement and then i treated them to the old boot-crush, though they were hard bastard

there were a few starry letters, some of them dating right back to 1960 with “my dearest dearest” in t

“makes you feel real dobby, that does,” said pete. you could viddy that poor old dim the dim didn’t quite pony all that, but he said nothing for fear of being called gloopy and a domeless wonderboy. well, we went off now round the corner to attlee avenue, and there was this sweets and cancers shop still open. we’d left them alone near three months now and the whole district had been very quiet on the whole, so the armed millicents or rozz patrols weren’t round there much, being more north of the river these days. we put our maskies on—new jobs these were, real horrorsho

“a real big heavy great bastard he was,” dim kept saying. i didn’t like the look of dim: he looked dirty and untidy, like a veck who’d been in a fight, which he had been, of course, but you should never look as though you have been. his cravat was like someone had trampled on it, his maskie had been pulled off and he had floor-dirt on his litso, so we got him in an alleyway and tidied him up a malenky bit, soaking our tashtooks in spit to cheest the dirt off. the things we did for old dim. we were back in the duke of new york very sko

dge all filthy and rolling and burping and drunk, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real starry like this one was. he was sort of flattened to the wall and his platties were a disgrace, all creased and untidy and covered in cal and mud and filth and stuff. so we got hold of him and cracked him with a few good horrorshow tolchoks, but he still went on singing. the song went:

		and i will go back to my darling, my darling,

but when dim fisted him a few times on his filthy drunkard’s rot he shut up singing and started to creech: “go on, do me in, you bastard cowards, i don’t want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this one.” i told dim to lay off a bit then, because it used to interest me sometimes to slooshy what some of these starry decreps had to say about life and the world. i said: “oh. and what’s stinking about it?”

he cried out: “it’s a stinking world because it lets the young get on to th

there were four of us to six of them, like i have already indicated, but poor old dim, for all his dimness, was worth three of the others in sheer madness and dirty fighting. dim had a real horrorshow length of oozy or chain round his waist, twice wound round, and he unwound this and began to swing it beautiful in the eyes or glazzies. pete and georgie had good sharp nozhes, but i for my own part had a fine starry horrorshow cut-throat britva which, at that time, i could flash and shine artistic. so there we were dratsing away in the dark, the old luna with men on it just coming

 up, the stars stabbing away as it might be knives anxious to join in the dratsing. with my britva i managed to slit right down the front of one of billyboy’s droog’s platties, very very neat and not even touching the plott under the cloth. then in the dratsing this droog of billyboy’s suddenly found himself all opened up like a peapod, with his belly bare and his poor old yarbles showing, and then he got very razdraz, waving and screaming and losing his guard and letting in old dim with his chain snaking whisssssshhhhhhhhh, so that old dim chained him right in the glazzies, and this droog of billyboy’s went tottering off and howling his heart out. we were doing very horrorshow, and soon we had billyboy’s number-one down underfoot, blinded with old dim’s chain and crawling and howling about like an animal, but with one fair boot on the gulliver he was out and out and out.

this would be the telly. tonight was what thy called a worldcast, meaning that the same programme was being viddied by everybody in the world that wanted to, that being mostly the middle-aged middle-class lewdies. there would be some big famous stupid comic chelloveck or black singer, and it was all being bounced off the special telly satellites in outer space, my brothers. we waited panting, and we could slooshy the sirening millicents going east, so we knew we were all right now. but poor old dim kept looking up at the stars and planets and the luna with his rot wide open like a kid who’d never viddied any such things before, and he said:

“what’s on them, i wonder. what would be up there on things like that?”

i nudged him hard, saying: “come, gloopy bastard as thou art. think thou not on them. there’ll be life like down here most likely, with some getting knifed and others doing the knifing. and now, with the nochy still molodoy, let us be on our way, o my brothers.”

 the others smecked at this, but poor old dim looked at me serious, then up again at the stars and the luna. so we went on our way down the alley, with the worldcast blueing on on either side. what we needed now was an auto, so we turned left coming out of the alley, knowing right away we were in priestly place as soon as we viddied the big bronze statue of some starry poet with an apey upper lip and a pipe stuck in a droopy old rot. going north we came to the filthy old filmdrome, peeling and dropping to bits through nobody going there mu

we fillied round what was called the backtown for a bit, scaring old vecks and cheenas that were crossing the roads and zigzagging after cats and that. then we took the road west. there wasn’t mu

then we saw one young malchick with his sharp, lubbilubbing under a tree, so we stopped and cheered at them, then we bashed into them both with a couple of half-hearted tolchocks, making them cry, and on we went. what we were after now was the old surprise visit. that was a real kick and good for smecks and lashings of the ultra-violent. we came at last to a sort of village, and just outside this village was a small sort o

the devotchka sort of hesitated and then said: “wait.” then she went off, and my three droogs had got out of the auto quiet and crept up horrorshow stealthy, putting their maskies on now, then i put mine on, then it was only a matter of me putting in the old rooker and undoing the chain, me having softened up this devotchka with my gent’s goloss, so that she hadn’t shut the door like she should have done, us being strangers of the night. the four of us then went roaring in, old dim playing the shoot as usual with his jumping up and down and singing out dirty slovos, and it was a nice malenky cottage, i’ll say that. we all went smecking into the room with a light on, and there was this devotchka sort of cowering, a young pretty bit of sharp with real horrorshow groodies on her, and with her was this chelloveck who was her moodge, youngish too with horn-rimmed otchkies on him, and on a table was a typewriter and all papers scattered everywhere, but there was one little pi

“what is this? who are you? how dare you enter my house without permission.” and all the time his goloss was trembling and his rookers too. so i said:

“never fear. if fear thou hast in thy heart, o brother, pray banish it forthwith.” then georgie and pete went out to find the kitchen, while old dim waited for orders, standing next to me with his rot wide open. “what is this, then?” i said, picking up the pile like of typing from off of the table, and the horn-rimmed moodge said, dithering:

“that’s just what i want to know. what is this? what do you want? get out at once before i throw you out.” so poor old dim, masked like peebee shelley, had a good loud smeck at that, roaring like some animal.

then after me it was right old dim should have his turn, which he did in a beasty snorty howly sort of a way with his peebee shelley maskie taking no notice, while i held on to her. then there was a changeover, dim and me grabbing the slobbering writer veck who was past struggling really, only just coming out with slack sort of slovos like he was in the land in a milk-plus bar, and pete and georgie had theirs. then there was like quiet and we were full of like hate, so smashed what was left to be smashed—typewriter, lamp, chai

then we made for the station to ride the one stop to center, as the middle of the town was called. we paid our fares nice and polite and waited gentlemanly and quiet on the platform, old dim fillying with the slot machines, his carmans being full of small malenky coin, and ready if need be to distribute chocbars to the poor and starving, though there was none such about, and then the old espresso rapido came lumbering in and we climbe

we got out at center and walked slow back to the korova milkbar, all going yawwwww a malenky bit and exhibiting to moon and star and lamplight our back fillings, because we were still only growing malchicks and had school in the daytime, and when we got into the korova we found it fuller than when we’d left earlier on. but the chello

it was nadsats milking and coking and fillying around (nadsats were what we used to call the teens), but there were a few of the more starry ones, vecks and cheenas alike (but not of the bourgeois, never them) laughing and govoreeting at the bar. you could tell them f

but old dim, as soon as he’d slooshied this dollop of song like a lomtick of redhot meat plonked on your plate, let off one of his vulgarities, which in this case was a lip-trump followed by a dog-howl followed by two fingers pronging twice at the air followed by a clowny guffaw. i felt myself all of a fever and like drowning in redhot blood, slooshying and viddying dim’s vulgarity, and i said: “bastard. filthy drooling mannerless bastard.” then i leaned across georgie, who was between me and horri

dim put on a hound-and-horny look of evil, saying: “i don’t like you should do what you done then. and i’m not your brother no more and wouldn’t want to be.” he’d taken a big snotty tashtook from his pocket and was mopping the red flow puzzled, keeping on looking at it frowning as if he thought that blood was for other vecks and not for him. it was like he was singing blood to make up for his vulgarity when that devotchka was singing music. but that devotchka was smecking away ha ha ha

g now. we are all droogs, but somebody has to be in charge. right? right?” they all like nodded, wary like. dim was osooshing the last of the krovvy off. it was dim who said now:

“right, right. doobidoob. a bit tired, maybe, everybody is. best not to say more.” i was surprised and just that malenky bit poogly to sloosh dim govoreeting that wise. dim said:

“bedways is rightways now, so best we go homeways. right?” i was very surprised. the other two nodded, going right right right. i said:

“you understand about that tolchock on the rot, dim. it was the music, see. i get all bezoomny when any veck interferes with a ptitsa singing, as it might be. like that then.”

“best we go off homeways and get a bit of spatchka,” said dim. “a long night for growing malchicks. right?” right right nodded the other two. i said:

i think it best we go home now. dim has made a real horrorshow suggestion. if we don’t meet day-wise, o my brothers, well then—same time same place tomorrow?”

“oh yes,” said georgie. “i think that can be arranged.”

“i might,” said dim, “be just that malenky bit late. but same place and near same time tomorrow surely.” he was still wiping at his goober, though no krovvy flowed any longer now. “and,” he said, “it is to be hoped there won’t be no more of them singing ptitsas in here.” then he gave his old dim guff, a clowny big hohohohoho. it seemed like he was too dim to take much offence.

so off we went our several ways, me belching arrrrgh on the cold coke i’d peeted. i had my cut-throat britva handy in ca

very real like sneety, dreaming for some reason of my droog georgie. in this sneety he’d got like very much older and very sharp and hard and was govoreeting about discipline and obedience and how all the malchicks under his control had to jump hard at it and throw up the old salute like being in the army, and there was me in line like the rest saying yes sir and no sir, and the i viddied clear that georgie had these stars on his pletchoes and he was like a general. and then he brought in old dim with a whip, and dim was a lot more starry and grey and had a few zoobies missing as you could see when he let out a smeck, viddying me, and then my droog georgie said, pointing like at me: “that man has filth and cal all over his platties,” and it was true. then i creeched:

“don’t hit, please don’t, brothers,” and started to run. and i was running in like circles and dim was after me, smecking his gulliver off, cracking with the old whip, and each time i got a real horrorshow to

“it was vivid,” said my dad. “i saw you lying on the street and you had been beaten by other boys. these boys were like the boys you used to go around with before you were sent to that last corrective school.”

“oh?” i had an in-grin at that, papapa believing i had really reformed or believing he believed. and then i remembered my own dream, which was a dream of that morning, of georgie giving his general’s orders and old dim smecking around toothless as he wielded the whip. but dreams go by opposites i was once told. “never worry about thine only son and heir, o my father,” i said. “fear not. he canst taketh care of himself, verily.”

“and,” said my dad, “you were like helpless in your blood and you couldn’t fight back.” that was real opposites, so i had another quiet malenky grin within and then i took all the deng out of my carmans and tinkled it on the saucy table-cloth. i said:

when i got to the bottom of the stairs of the flatblock i was somewhat surprised. i was more than that. i opened my rot like wide in the old stony gapes. they had come to meet me. they were waiting by the all scrawled-over municipal wall-painting of the nagoy dignity of labour, bare vecks and cheenas stern at the wheels of industry, like i said, with all this dirt pencilled from their rots by naughty malchicks. dim had a big thick stick of black greasepaint and was tracing filthy slovos real big over our municipal painting and doing the old dim guff—wuh huh huh—while he did it. but he turned round when georgie and pete gave me the well hello, showing their shining droogy zoobies, and he horned out: “he are here, he have arrived, hooray,” and did a clumsy turnitoe bit of dancing.

“we got worried,” said georgie. “there we were awaiting and peeting away at the old knify moloko, and you might

cipline and such, perhaps. sure the pain is gone? sure you’ll not be happier going back to the bed?” and they all had a bit of a malenky grin.

“wait,” i said. “let’s get things nice and sparkling clear. this sarcasm, if i may call it such, does not become you, o my little friends. perhaps you have been having a bit of a quiet govoreet behind my back, making your own little jokes and such-like. as i am your droog and leader, surely i am entitled to know what goes on, eh? now then, dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?” for dim had his rot open in a sort of bezoomny soundless smeck. georgie got in very skorry with:

“all right, no more picking on dim, brother. that’s part of the new way.”

“new way?” i said. “what’s this about a new way? there’s been some very large talk behind my sleeping back and no error. let me slooshy more.” and i sort of folded my rookers and leaned comfortable to listen against the broken banister-rail, me

i didn’t care for any of this, my brothers. “and what will you do,” i said, “with the big big big deng or money as you so highfaluting call it? have you not every veshch you need? if you need an auto you pluck it from the trees. if you need pretty polly you take it. yes? why this sudden shilarny for being the big bloated capitalist?”

“ah,” said georgie, “you think and govoreet sometimes like a little child.” dim went huh huh huh at that. “tonight,” said georgie, “we pull a mansize crast.”

so my dream had told truth, then. georgie the general saying what we should do and what not do, dim with the whip as mindless grinning bulldog. but i played with care, with great care, the greatest, saying, smiling: “good. real horrorshow. initiative comes to them as wait. i have taught you much, little droogie. now tell me what you have in mind, georgie-boy.”

“i never said anything,” said pete. “i never govoreeted one slovo. look, old dim’s bleeding to death.”

“never,” i said. “one can die but once. dim died before he was born. that red red krovvy will soon stop.” because i had not cut into the like main cables. and i myself took a clean tashtook from my carman to wrap round poor old dying dim’s rooker, howling and moaning as he was, and the krovvy stopped like i said it would, o my brothers. so they knew now who was master and leader, sheep, thought i.

“now we’re back to where we were, yes? just like before and all forgotten, right?”

“right right right,” said georgie. but old dim still looked a bit dazed and he even said: “i could have got that big bastard, see, with my oozy, only some veck got in the way,” as though he’d been dratsing not with me but with some other malchick. i said:

“well, georgieboy, what did you have in mind?”

“oh,” said georgie, “not tonight. not this nochy, please.”

“what gloopy name?”

what was ittying on was that this starry ptitsa, very grey in the voloss and with a very liny like litso, was pouring the old moloko from a milk-bottle into saucers and then setting these saucers down on the floor, so you could tell t

“she may not open.” i said:

“we’ll try it, yes?” and he sort of shrugged his pletchoes, making with a frog’s rot. so i said to pete and old dim: “you two droogies get either side of the door. right?” they nodded in the dark right right right. “so,” i said to georgie, and i made bold straight for the front door. there was a bellpush and i pushed, and brrrrrrr brrrrr sounded down the hall inside. alike sense of slooshying followed, as though the ptitsa and her koshkas all had their ears back at the brrrrrr brrrrrr, wondering. so i pushed the old zvonock a malenky bit more urgent. i then bent down to the letter-slit and called thr

then we waited again in the dark and i whispered: “right. return to the door. me stand on dim’s pletchoes. open that window and me enter, droogies. then to shut up that old ptitsa and open up for all. no trouble.” for i was like showing who was leader and the chelloveck with the ideas. “see,” i said. “real horrorshow bit of stonework over that door, a nice hold for my nogas.” they viddied all that, admiring perhaps i thought, and said and nodded right right right in the dark.

the window, as i had expected, was closed, but i outed with my britva and cracked the glass of the window smart with the bony handle thereof. all the time below my droogies were hard breathing. so i put in my rooker through the crack and made the lower half of the window sail up open silver-smooth and lovely. and i was, like getting into the bath, in. and there were m
