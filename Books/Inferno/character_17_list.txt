Guido da Montefeltro - 
An advisor to Pope Boniface VIII, da Montefeltro
was promised anticipatory absolution--forgiveness for a sin given
prior to the perpetration of the sin itself. Da Montefeltro now
suffers in Hell, since absolution cannot be gained without repentance
and it is impossible to repent a sin before committing it.
