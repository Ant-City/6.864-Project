captain fluellen, captain macmorris, and
captain jamy - 
                 the captains of king
henry's troops from wales, ireland, and scotland, respectively,
all of whom have heavy accents reflecting their countries of origin. fluellen,
a close friend of captain gower, is the most prominent of the three.
his wordiness provides comic relief, but he is also very likable
and is an intelligent leader and strategist.
