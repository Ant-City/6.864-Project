[CHARACTER]  - 
a mysterious, confident, and resourceful man who
seems to have been a mercenary soldier in africa. lombard is far
bolder and more cunning than most of the other characters, traits
that allow him to survive almost until the end of the novel. his
weakness is his chivalrous attitude toward women, particularly vera, with
whom he has a number of private conversations. he cannot think of
her as a potential killer, and he underestimates her resourcefulness,
which proves a fatal mistake.
