what it meant to miss someone who was so
many miles and hours away, just as he had missed his wife and daughters for so many
months. he had no reason to return to us, and my parents predicted, correctly, that we
would never see him again. since january, each night before bed, i had continued to
eat, for the sake of mr. pirzada’s family, a piece of candy i had saved from halloween.

attheteastall mr. and mrs. das bickered about who should take tina to the toilet.
eventually mrs. das relented when mr. das pointed out that he had given the girl her
bath the night before. in the rearview mirror mr. kapasi watched as mrs. das emerged
slowly from his bulky white ambassador, dragging her shaved, largely bare legs across
the back seat. she did not hold the little girl’s hand as they walked to the rest room.

sightseeing. ordinarily mr. kapasi would not have stopped so soon along the way, but
less than five minutes after he’d picked up the family that morning in front of hotel
sandy villa, the little girl had complained. the first thing mr. kapasi had noticed when
he saw mr. and mrs. das, standing with their children under the portico of the hotel, was
that they were very young, perhaps not even thirty. in addition to tina they had two
boys, ronny and bobby, who appeared very close in age and had teeth covered in a
network of flashing silver wires. the family looked indian but dressed as foreigners did,
the children in stiff, brightly colored clothing and caps with translucent visors. mr. kapasi
was accustomed to foreign tourists; he was assigned to them regularly because he

uld speak english. yesterday he had driven an elderly couple from scotland, both
with spotted faces and fluffywhite hair so thin it exposed their sunburnt scalps. in
comparison, the tanned, youthful faces of mr. and mrs. das were all the more striking.
when he’d introduced himself, mr. kapasi had pressed his palms together in greeting,
but mr. das squeezed hands like an american so that mr. kapasi felt it in his elbow.
mrs. das, for her part, had flexed one side of her mouth, smiling dutifully at mr. kapasi,
without displaying any interest in him.
as they waited at the tea stall, ronny, who looked like the older of the two boys,
clambered suddenly out of the back seat, intrigued by a goat tied to a stake in the
ground.
“don’t touch it,”mr. das said. he glanced up from his paperback tour book, which said
“india”in yellow letters and looked as if it had been published abroad. his voice,
somehow tentative and a

 little shrill, sounded as though it had not yet settled into
maturity.
“iwant to give it a piece of gum,” the boy called back as he trotted ahead.
mr. das stepped out of the car and stretched his legs by squatting briefly to the ground.
a clean-shaven man, he looked exactly like a magnified version of ronny. he had a
sapphire blue visor, and was dressed in shorts, sneakers, and a t-shirt. the camera
slung around his neck, with an impressive telephoto lens and numerous buttons and
markings, was the only complicated thing he wore. he frowned, watching as ronny
rushed toward the goat, but appeared to have no intention of intervening. “bobby, make

cket-style shirt, tapered at the waist, with short
sleeves and a large pointed collar, made of a thin but durable synthetic material. he had
specified both the cut and the fabric to his tailor—it was his preferred uniform for giving
tours because it did not get crushed during his long hours behind the wheel. through
the windshield he watched as ronny circled around the goat, touched it quickly on its
side, then trotted back to the car.
“you left india as a child?” mr. kapasi asked when mr. das had settled once again into
the passenger seat.
“oh, mina and i were both born in america,” mr. das announced with an air of sudden
confidence. “born and raised. our parents live here now. they retired. we visit them
every couple years.” he turned to watch as the little girl ran toward the car, the wide
purple bows of her sundress flopping on her narrow brown shoulders. she was holding
to her chest a doll with yellow hair that looked as if it had been chopped, as a punitive
measure, wit

h a pair of dull scissors. “this is tina’s first trip to india, isn’t it, tina?”
“idon’t have to go to the bathroom anymore,” tina announced.
“where’s mina?” mr. das asked.
mr. kapasi found it strange that mr. das should refer to his wife by her first name when
speaking to the little girl. tina pointed to where mrs. das was purchasing something
from one of the shirtless men who worked at the tea stall. mr. kapasi heard one of the
shirtless men sing a phrase from a popular hindi love song as mrs. das walked back to
the car, but she did not appear to understand the words of the song, for she did not
express irritation, or embarrassment, or react in any other way to the man’s
declarations.
he observed her. she wore a red-and-white-checkered skirt that stopped above her
knees, slip-on shoes with a square wooden

 fingernails painted to match her lips, and was slightly plump in her figure. her hair,
shorn only a little longer than her husband’s, was parted far to one side. she was
wearing large dark brown sunglasses with a pinkish tint to them, and carried a big straw
bag, almost as big as her torso, shaped like a bowl, with a water bottle poking out of it.
she walked slowly, carrying some puffed rice tossed with peanuts and chili peppers in a
large packet made from newspapers. mr. kapasi turned to mr. das.
“where in america do you live?”
“new brunswick, new jersey.”
“next to new york?”
“exactly. i teach middle school there.”
“what subject?”
“science. in fact, every year i take my students on a trip to the museum of natural
history in new york city. in a way we have a lot in common, you could say, you and i.
how long have you been a tour guide, mr. kapasi?”
“five years.”
mrs. das reached the car. “how long’s the trip?” she asked, shutting the door.
“about two a

nd a half hours,” mr. kapasi replied.
at this mrs. das gave an impatient sigh, as ifshe had been traveling her whole life
without pause. she fanned herself with a folded bombay film magazine written in
english.
“ithought that the sun temple is only eighteen miles north of puri,” mr. das said,
tapping on the tour book.
“the roads to konarak are poor. actually it is a distance of fifty-two miles,” mr. kapasi
explained.
mr. das nodded, readjusting the camera strap where it had begun to chafe the back of
his neck.
before starting the ignition, mr. kapasi reached back to make sure the cranklike locks
on the inside of each of the back doors were secured. as soon as the car began to
move the little girl began to play with the lock on her side, clicking it with some effort
forward and backward, but mrs. das said nothing to stop her. she sat a bit slouched at
one end of the back seat, not offering her puffed rice to anyone.

swung their feet, staring as the car passed.
“we call them the hanuman,” mr. kapasi said. “they are quite common in the area.”
as soon as he spoke, one of the monkeys leaped into the middle of the road, causing
mr. kapasi to brake suddenly. another bounced onto the hood of the car, then sprang
away. mr. kapasi beeped his horn. the children began to get excited, sucking in their
breath and covering their faces partly with their hands. they had never seen monkeys
outside of a zoo, mr. das explained. he asked mr. kapasi to stop the car so that he
could take a picture.
while mr. das adjusted his telephoto lens, mrs. das reached into her straw bag and
pulled out a bottle of colorless nail polish, which she proceeded to stroke on the tip of
her index finger.
the little girl stuck out a hand. “mine too. mommy, do mine too.”
“leave me alone,” mrs. das said, blowing on her nail and turning her body slightly.
“you’remaking me mess up.”
the little girl occupied herself by b

the car rattled considerably as it raced along the dusty road, causing them all to pop up
from their seats every now and then, but mrs. das continued to polish her nails. mr.
kapasi eased up on the accelerator, hoping to produce a smoother ride. when he
reached for the gearshift the boy in front accommodated him by swinging his hairless
knees out of the way. mr. kapasi noted that this boy was slightly paler than the other
children. “daddy, why is the driver sitting on the wrong side in this car, too?” the boy
asked.
“they all do that here, dummy,” ronny said.
“don’t call your brother a dummy,” mr. das said. he turned

to mr. kapasi. “in america,
you know … it confuses them.”
“oh yes, i am well aware,” mr. kapasi said. as delicately as he could, he shifted gears
again, accelerating as they approached a hill in the road. “isee it on dallas, the
steering wheels are on the left-hand side.”
“what’s dallas? ” tina asked, banging her now naked doll on the seat behind mr.
kapasi.
“itwent off the air,” mr. das explained. “it’s a television show.”
they were all like siblings, mr. kapasi thought as they passed a row of date trees. mr.
and mrs. das behaved like an older brother and sister, not parents. it seemed that they
were in charge of the children only for the day; it was hard to believe they were regularly
responsible for anything other than themselves. mr. das tapped on his lens cap, and his
tour book, dragging his thumbnail occasionally across the pages so that they made a
scraping sound.

mrs. das continued to polish her nails. she had still not removed her
sunglasses. every now and then tina renewed her plea that she wanted her nails done,
too, and so at one point mrs. das flicked a drop of polish on the little girl’s finger before
depositing the bottle back inside her straw bag.
“isn’t this an air-conditioned car?” she asked, still blowing on her hand. the window on
tina’s side was broken and could not be rolled down.
“quit complaining,” mr. das said. “itisn’t so hot.”
“itold you to get a car with air-conditioning,” mrs. das continued. “why do you do this,
raj, just to save a few stupid rupees. what are you saving us, fiftycents?”
their accents sounded just like the ones mr. kapasi heard on american television
programs, though not like the ones on dallas.
“doesn’t it get tiresome, mr. kapasi, showing people the same thing every day?” mr.
das asked, rolling down his own window all the way. “hey, do you mind stoppin

car. i just want to get a shot of this guy.”
mr. kapasi pulled over to the side of the road as mr. das took a picture of a barefoot
man, his head wrapped in a dirty turban, seated on top of a cart of grain sacks pulled by
a pair of bullocks. both the man and the bullocks were emaciated. in the back seat mrs.
das gazed out another window, at the sky, where nearly transparent clouds passed
quickly in front of one another.
“ilook forward to it, actually,” mr. kapasi said as they continued on their way. “the sun

“oh? where?” mr. das asked.
“iwork in a doctor’s office.”
“you’re a doctor?”
“i am not a doctor. i work with one. as an interpreter.”
“what does a doctor need an interpreter for?”
“he has a number of gujarati patients. my father was gujarati, but many people do not
speak gujarati in this area, including the doctor. and so the doctor asked me to work in
his office, interpreting what the patients say.”
“interesting. i’ve never heard of anything like that,” mr. das said.
mr. kapasi shrugg

ed. “itis a job like any other.”
“but so romantic,” mrs. das said dreamily, breaking her extended silence. she lifted her
pinkish brown sunglasses and arranged them on top of her head like a tiara. for the first
time, her eyes met mr. kapasi’s in the rearview mirror: pale, a bit small, their gaze fixed
but drowsy.
mr. das craned to look at her. “what’s so romantic about it?”
“idon’t know. something.” she shrugged, knitting her brows together for an instant.
“would you like a piece of gum, mr. kapasi?” she asked brightly. she reached into her
straw bag and handed him a small square wrapped in green-and-white-striped paper.
as soon as mr. kapasi put the gum in his mouth a thick sweet liquid burst onto his
tongue.
“tellus more about your job, mr. kapasi,” mrs. das said.

“very well. the other day a man came in with a pain in his throat.”
“did he smoke cigarettes?”
“no. it was very curious. he complained that he felt as if there were long pieces of straw
stuck in his throat. when i told the doctor he was able to prescribe the proper
medication.”
“that’s so neat.”
“yes,” mr. kapasi agreed after some hesitation.
“so these patients are totally dependent on you,” mrs. das said. she spoke slowly, as if
she were thinking aloud. “in a way, more dependent on you than the doctor.”
“how do you mean? how could it be?”
“well, for example, you could tell the doctor that the pain felt like a burning, not straw.
the patient would never know what you had told the doctor, and the doctor wouldn’t
know that you had told the wrong thing. it’s a big responsibility.”
“yes, a big responsibility you have there, mr. kapasi,” mr. das agreed.
mr. kapasi had never t

terpreter. he knew it reminded her of the son she’d lost, and that she
resented the other lives he helped, in his own small way, to save. if ever she referred to
his position, she used the phrase “doctor’s assistant,” as if the process of interpretation
were equal to taking someone’s temperature, or changing a bedpan. she never asked
him about the patients who came to the doctor’s office, or said that his job was a big
responsibility.
for this reason it flattered mr. kapasi that mrs. das was so intrigued by his job. unlike
his wife, she had reminded him of its intellectual challenges. she had also used the
word “romantic.” she did not behave in a romantic way toward her husband, and yet
she had used the word to describe him. he wondered if mr. and mrs. das were a bad
match, just as he and his wife were. perhaps they, too, had little in common apart from
three children and a decade of their lives. the signs he recognized from his own
marriage were there—the bickering, the

cted silences. her
sudden interest in him, an interest she did not express in either her husband or her
children, was mildly intoxicating. when mr. kapasi thought once again about how she
had said “romantic,” the feeling of intoxication grew.
he began to check his reflection in the rearview mirror as he drove, feeling grateful that
he had chosen the gray suit that morning and not the brown one, which tended to sag a
little in the knees. from time to time he glanced through the mirror at mrs. das. in
addition to glancing at her face he glanced at the strawberry between her breasts, and
the golden brown hollow in her throat. he decided to tell mrs. das about another patient,
and another: the young woman who had complained of a sensation of raindrops in her
spine, the gentleman whose birthmark had begun to sprout hairs. mrs. das listened
attentively, stroking her hair with a small plastic brush that resembled an oval bed of
nails, asking more questions, for yet another example. the childr

en were quiet, intent
on spotting more monkeys in the trees, and mr. das was absorbed by his tour book, so
it seemed like a private conversation between mr. kapasi and mrs. das. in this manner
the next half hour passed, and when they stopped for lunch at a roadside restaurant
that sold fritters and omelette sandwiches, usually something mr. kapasi looked forward
to on his tours so that he could sit in peace and enjoy some hot tea, he was
disappointed. as the das family settled together under a magenta umbrella fringed with
white and orange tassels, and placed their orders with one of the waiters who marched
about in tricornered caps, mr. kapasi reluctantly headed toward a neighboring table.
“mr.kapasi, wait. there’s room here,” mrs. das called out. she gathered tina onto her
lap, insisting that he accompany them. and so, together, they had bottled mango juice
and sandwiches and plates of onions and potatoes deep-fried in graham-flour batter.

r finishing two omelette sandwiches mr. das took more pictures of the group as they
ate.
“how much longer?” he asked mr. kapasi as he paused to load a new roll of film in the
camera.
“about half an hour more.”
by now the children had gotten up from the table to look at more monkeys perched in a
nearby tree, so there was a considerable space between mrs. das and mr. kapasi. mr.
das placed the camera to his face and squeezed one eye shut, his tongue exposed at
one corner of his mouth. “this looks funny. mina, you need to lean in closer to mr.
kapasi.”
she did. he could smell a scent on her skin, like a mixture of whiskey and rosewater.
he worried suddenly that she could smell his perspiration, which he knew had collected
beneath the synthetic material of his shirt. he polished off his mango juice in one gulp
and smoothed his silver hair with his

wondered if mrs. das had noticed.
she had not. “what’s your address, mr. kapasi?” she inquired, fishing for something
inside her straw bag.
“youwould like my address?”
“so we can send you copies,” she said. “of the pictures.” she handed him a scrap of
paper which she had hastily ripped from a page of her film magazine. the blank portion
was limited, for the narrow strip was crowded by lines of text and a tiny picture of a hero
and heroine embracing under a eucalyptus tree.

d pleasant shock. it was similar to a feeling he used to experience long ago
when, after months of translating with the aid of a dictionary, he would finally read a
passage from a french novel, or an italian sonnet, and understand the words, one after
another, unencumbered by his own efforts. in those moments mr. kapasi used to
believe that all was right with the world, that all struggles were rewarded, that all of life’s
mistakes made sense in the end. the promise that he would hear from mrs. das now
filled him with the same belief.
when he finished writing his address mr. kapasi handed her the paper, but as soon as
he did so he worried that he had either misspelled his name, or accidentally reversed
the numbers of his postal code. he dreaded the possibility of a lost letter, the
photograph never reaching him, hovering somewhere in orissa, close but ultimately
unattainable. he thought of asking for the slip of paper again, just to make sure he had
written his address accurately, but mrs

they reached konarak at two-thirty. the temple, made of sandstone, was a massive
pyramid-like structure in the shape of a chariot. it was dedicated to the great master of
life, the sun, which struck three sides of the edifice as it made its journey each day
across the sky. twenty-four giant wheels were carved on the north and south sides of
the plinth. the whole thing was drawn by a team of seven horses, speeding as if
through the heavens. as t

hey approached, mr. kapasi explained that the temple had
been built between a.d. 1243 and 1255, with the efforts of twelve hundred artisans, by
the great ruler of the ganga dynasty, king narasimhadeva the first, to commemorate
his victory against the muslim army.
“itsays the temple occupies about a hundred and seventy acres of land,” mr. das said,
reading from his book.
“it’slike a desert,” ronny said, his eyes wandering across the sand that stretched on all
sides beyond the temple.
“the chandrabhaga river once flowed one mile north of here. it is dry now,” mr.
kapasi said, turning off the engine.
they got out and walked toward the temple, posing first for pictures by the pair of lions
that flanked the steps. mr. kapasi led them next to one of the wheels of the chariot,
higher than any human being, nine feet in diameter.

page of his book. “‘each wheel is divided into eight thick and thin spokes, dividing the
day into eight equal parts. the rims are carved with designs of birds and animals,
whereas the medallions in the spokes are carved with women in luxurious poses,

around their lovers’ thighs. in addition to these were assorted scenes from daily life, of
hunting and trading, of deer being killed with bows and arrows and marching warriors
holding swords in their hands.
it was no longer possible to enter the temple, for it had filled with rubble years ago, but
they admired the exterior, as did all the tourists mr. kapasi brought there, slowly
strolling along each of its sides. mr. das trailed behind, taking pictures. the children ran
ahead, pointing to figures of naked people, intrigued in particular by the nagamithunas,
the half-human, half-serpentine couples who were said, mr. kapasi told them, to live in
the deepest waters of the sea. mr. kapasi was pleased that they liked the temple,
pleased especially that it appealed to mrs. das. she stopped every three or four paces,
staring silently at the carved lovers, and the processions of elephants, and the topless

ans beating on two-sided drums.
though mr. kapasi had been to the temple countless times, it occurred to him, as he,
too, gazed at the topless women, that he had never seen his own wife fully naked. even
when they had made love she kept the panels of her blouse hooked together, the string
of her petticoat knotted around her waist. he had never admired the backs of his wife’s
legs the way he now admired those of mrs. das, walking as if for his benefit alone. he
had, of course, seen plenty of bare limbs before, belonging to the american and
european ladies who took his tours. but mrs. das was different. unlike the other
women, who had an interest only in the temple, and kept their noses buried in a
guidebook, or their eyes behind the lens of a camera, mrs. das had taken an interest in
him.
mr. kapasi was anxious to be alone with her, to continue their private conversation, yet
he felt nervous to walk at her side

their bare chests draped with carved chains and amulets. hibiscus petals, offerings from
previous visitors, were strewn at their gray-green feet. the last statue, on the northern
wall of the temple, was mr. kapasi’s favorite. this surya had a tired expression, weary
after a hard day of work, sitting astride a horse with folded legs. even his horse’s eyes
were drowsy. around his body were smaller sculptures of women in pairs, their hips
thrust to one side.
“who’s that?” mrs. das asked. he was startled to see that she was standing beside him.
“he is the astachala-surya,” mr. kapasi said. “the setting sun.”
“so in a couple of hours the sun willset right here?” she slipped a foot out of one of her
square-heeled shoes, rubbed her toes on the back of her other leg.
“that is correct.”
she raised her sunglasses for a moment, then put them back on again. “neat.”
mr. kapasi was not certain exactly what the word suggested, but he had a feeling it was

power. perhaps they would discuss it further in their letters. he would explain things to
her, things about india, and she would explain things to him about america. in its own
way this correspondence would fulfillhis dream, of serving as an interpreter between
nations. he looked at her straw bag, delighted that his address lay nestled among its
contents. when he pictured her so many thousands of miles away he plummeted, so
much so that he had an overwhelmin

g urge to wrap his arms around her, to freeze with
her, even for an instant, in an embrace witnessed by his favorite surya. but mrs. das
had already started walking.
“when do you return to america?” he asked, trying to sound placid.
“in ten days.”
he calculated: a week to settle in, a week to develop the pictures, a few days to
compose her letter, two weeks to get to india by air. according to his schedule, allowing
room for delays, he would hear from mrs. das in approximately six weeks’ time.
the family was silent as mr. kapasi drove them back, a little past four-thirty, to hotel
sandy villa. the children had bought miniature granite versions of the chariot’s wheels
at a souvenir stand, and they turned them round in their hands. mr. das continued to
read his book. mrs. das untangled tina’s hair with her brush and divided it into two little
ponytails.

the rear-view mirror, wrapping elastic bands around tina’s hair, he wondered how he
might make the tour last a little longer. ordinarily he sped back to puri using a shortcut,
eager to return home, scrub his feet and hands with sandalwood soap, and enjoy the
evening newspaper and a cup of tea that his wife would serve him in silence. the
thought of that silence, something to which he’d long been resigned, now oppressed
him. it was then that he suggested visiti

number of monastic dwellings were hewn out of the ground, facing one another across
a defile. it was some miles away, but well worth seeing, mr. kapasi told them.
“oh yeah, there’s something mentioned about it in this book,” mr. das said. “builtby a
jain king or something.”
“shall we go then?” mr. kapasi asked. he paused at a turn in the road. “it’sto the left.”
mr. das turned to look at mrs. das. both of them shrugged.
“left, left,” the children chanted.
mr. kapasi turned the wheel, almost delirious with relief. he did not know what he would
do or say to mrs. das once they arrived at the hills. perhaps he would tell her what a
pleasing smile she had. perhaps he would compliment her strawberry shirt, which he
found irresistibly becoming. perhaps, when mr. das was busy taking a picture, he would
take her hand.
he did not have to worry. when they got to the hills, divided by a steep p

were seated on stones, as well as on the branches of the trees. their hind legs were
stretched out in front and raised to shoulder level, their arms resting on their knees.
“mylegs are tired,” she said, sinking low in her seat. “i’llstay here.”
“why did you have to wear those stupid shoes?” mr. das said. “youwon’t be in the
pictures.”
“pretend i’m there.”
“but we could use one of these pictures for our christmas card this year. we didn’t get
one of all five of us at the sun temple. mr. kapasi could take it.”
“i’mnot coming. anyway, those monkeys give me the creeps.”
“but they’re harmless,” mr. das said. he turned to mr. kapasi. “aren’t they?”

mr. das headed up the defile with the children, the boys at his side, the little girl on his
shoulders. mr. kapasi watched as they crossed paths with a japanese man and
woman, the only other tourists there, who paused for a final photograph, then stepped
into a nearby car and drove away. as the car disappeared out of view some of the
monkeys called out, emitting soft whooping sounds, and then walked on their flat black
hands and feet up the path. at one point a group of them formed a little ring around

the monkeys approached him and snatched it, then briefly beat the ground.
“i’lljoin them,” mr. kapasi said, unlocking the door on his side. “there is much to
explain about the caves.”
“no. stay a minute,” mrs. das said. she got out of the back seat and slipped in beside
mr. kapasi. “raj has his dumb book anyway.” together, through the windshield, mrs.
das and mr. kapasi watched as bobby and the monkey passed the stick back and forth
between them.

“it’snot so surprising,” mrs. das said.

instead he watched as the figures of mr. das and the children grew smaller, climbing up
the steep path, pausing every now and then for a picture, surrounded by a growing
number of monkeys.
“are you surprised?” the way she put it made him choose his words with care.
“it’snot the type of thing one assumes,” mr. kapasi replied slowly. he put the tin of
lotus-oil balm back in his pocket.
“no, of course not. and no one knows, of course. no one at all. i’ve kept it a secret for

against it.
“we met when we were very young,” she said. she reached into her straw bag in
search of something, then pulled out a packet of puffed rice. “want some?”
“no, thank you.”
she put a fistful in her mouth, sank into the seat a little, and looked away from mr.
kapasi, out the window on her side of the car. “we married when we were still in
college. we were in high school when he proposed. we went to the same college, of
course. back then we

avy suit. he made love to her swiftly, in silence, with an expertise she had
never known, without the meaningful expressions and smiles raj always insisted on
afterward. the next day raj drove the friend to jfk. he was married now, to a punjabi
girl, and they lived in london still, and every year they exchanged christmas cards with
raj and mina, each couple tucking photos of their families into the envelopes. he did
not know that he was bobby’s father. he never would.
“ibeg your pardon, mrs. das, but why have you told me this information?” mr. kapasi
asked when she had finally finished speaking, and had turned to face him once again.
“for god’s sake, stop calling me mrs. das. i’m twenty-eight. you probably have children
my age.”
“not quite.” it disturbed mr. kapasi to learn that she thought of him as a parent. the
feeling he had had toward her, that had made him check his reflection in the rearview
mirror as they drove, evaporated a little.
“itold you because of your ta

hat?”
“about what i’ve just told you. about my secret, and about how terrible it makes me feel.
i feel terrible looking at my children, and at raj, always terrible. i have terrible urges, mr.
kapasi, to throw things away. one day i had the urge to throw everything i own out the
window, the television, the children, everything. don’t you think it’s unhealthy?”
he was silent.
“mr.kapasi, don’t you have anything to say? i thought that was your job.”
“myjob is to give tours, mrs. das.”
“not that. your other job. as an interpreter.”
“but we do not face a language barrier. what need is there for an interpreter?”
“that’s not what i mean. i would never have told you otherwise. don’t you realize what it
means for me to tell you?”
“what does it mean?”
“itmeans that i’m tired of feeling so terrible all the time. eight years, mr. kapasi, i’ve
been in pain eight years. i was hoping you could help me feel better, say the right thing.

er, in her red plaid skirt and strawberry t-shirt, a woman not yet thirty,
who loved neither her husband nor her children, who had already fallen out of love with
life. her confession depressed him, depressed him all the more when he thought of mr.
das at the top of the path, tina clinging to his shoulders, taking pictures of ancient
monastic cells cut into the hills to show his students in america, unsuspecting and
unaware that one of his sons was not his own. mr. kapasi felt insulted that mrs. das
should ask him to interpret her common, trivial little secret. she did not resemble the
patients in the doctor’s office, those who came glassy-eyed and desperate, unable to
sleep or breathe or urinate with ease, unable, above all, to give words to their pains.
still, mr. kapasi believed it was his duty to assist mrs. das. perhaps he ought to tell her
to confess the truth to mr. das. he would explain that honesty was the best policy.
honesty, surely, would help her feel better, as she’d put

it. perhaps he would offer to
preside over the discussion, as a mediator. he decided to begin with the most obvious
question, to get to the heart of the matter, and so he asked, “is it really pain you feel,
mrs. das, or is it guilt?”
she turned to him and glared, mustard oil thick on her frosty pink lips. she opened her
mouth to say something, but as she glared at mr. kapasi some certain knowledge
seemed to pass before her eyes, and she stopped. it crushed him; he knew at that
moment that he was not even important enough to be properly insulted. she opened the
car door and began walking up the path, wobbling a little on her square wooden heels,
reaching into her straw bag to eat handfuls of puffed rice.

it fell through her fingers,
leaving a zigzagging trail, causing a monkey to leap down from a tree and devour the
little white grains. in search of more, the monkey began to follow mrs. das. others
joined him, so that she was soon being followed by about half a dozen of them, their
velvety tails dragging behind.
mr. kapasi stepped out of the car. he wanted to holler, to alert her in some way, but he
worried that ifshe knew they were behind her, she would grow nervous. perhaps she
would lose her balance. perhaps they would pull at her bag or her hair. he began to jog
up the path, taking a fallen branch in his hand to scare away the monkeys. mrs. das
continued walking, oblivious, tr

ailing grains of puffed rice. near the top of the incline,
before a group of cells fronted by a row of squat stone pillars, mr. das was kneeling on
the ground, focusing the lens of his camera. the children stood under the arcade, now
hiding, now emerging from view.
“wait for me,” mrs. das called out. “i’mcoming.”
tina jumped up and down. “here comes mommy!”
“great,” mr. das said without looking up. “just in time. we’ll get mr. kapasi to take a
picture of the five of us.”
mr. kapasi quickened his pace, waving his branch so that the monkeys scampered
away, distracted, in another direction.
“where’s bobby?” mrs. das asked when she stopped.
mr. das looked up from the camera. “idon’t know. ronny, where’s bobby?”
ronny shrugged. “ithought he was right here.”
“where is he?” mrs. das repeated sharply. “what’s wrong with all of you?”

tree, he was surrounded by a group of monkeys, over a
dozen of them, pulling at his t-shirt with their long black fingers. the puffed rice mrs.
das had spilled was scattered at his feet, raked over by the monkeys’ hands. the boy
was silent, his body frozen, swift tears running down his startled face. his bare legs
were dusty and red with welts from where one of the monkeys struck him repeatedly
with the stick he had given to it earlier.
“daddy, the monkey’s hurting bobby,” tina said.
mr. das wiped his palms on the front of his shorts. in his nervousness he accidentally
pressed the shutter on his camera; the whirring noise of the advancing film excited the
monkeys, and the one with the stick began to beat bobby more intently. “what are we
supposed to do? what if they start attacking?”
“mr.kapasi,” mrs. das shrieked, noticing him standing to one side. “do something, for
god’s sake, do something!”
mr. kapasi took his branch and shooed them away, hissing at the ones that

remained,
stomping his feet to scare them. the animals retreated slowly, with a measured gait,
obedient but unintimidated. mr. kapasi gathered bobby in his arms and brought him
back to where his parents and siblings were standing. as he carried him he was
tempted to whisper a secret into the boy’s ear. but bobby was stunned, and shivering
with fright, his legs bleeding slightly where the stick had broken the skin. when mr.
kapasi delivered him to his parents, mr. das brushed some dirt off the boy’s t-shirt and
put the visor on him the right way. mrs. das reached into her straw bag to find a
bandage which she taped over the cut on his knee. ronny offered his brother a fresh
piece of gum. “he’s fine. just a little scared, right, bobby?” mr. das said, patting the top
of his head.
“god, let’s get out of here,” mrs. das said. she folded her arms across the strawberry
on her chest. “this place gives me the creeps.”
“yeah. back to the hotel, de

finitely,” mr. das agreed.
“poor bobby, ” mrs. das said. “come here a second. let mommy fix your hair.” again
she reached into her straw bag, this time for her hairbrush, and began to run it around
the edges of the translucent visor. when she whipped out the hairbrush, the slip of
paper with mr. kapasi’s address on it fluttered away in the wind. no one but mr. kapasi
noticed. he watched as it rose, carried higher and higher by the breeze, into the trees
where the monkeys now sat, solemnly observing the scene below. mr. kapasi observed

boorima, sweeper of the stairwell, had not slept in two nights. so the morning before
the third night she shook the mites out of her bedding. she shook the quilts once
underneath the letter boxes where she lived, then once again at the mouth of the alley,
causing the crows who were feeding on vegetable peels to scatter in several directions.

 tedious cries woke him
each morning now thrilled him as they dipped and flapped across the sky. they passed
one beach after another, and the shacks, now locked up, that sold frozen lemonade and
quahogs in summer. only one of the shacks was open. it was the fish market.
mrs. sen unlocked her door and turned toward mr. sen, who had not yet unfastened his
seat belt. “are you coming?”
mr. sen handed her some bills from his wallet. “ihave a meeting in twenty minutes,” he
said, staring at the dashboard as he spoke. “please don’t waste time.”
eliot accompanied her into the dank little shop, whose walls were festooned with nets
and starfish and buoys. a group of tourists with cameras around their necks huddled by
the counter, some sampling stuffed clams, others pointing to a large chart illustrating
fiftydifferent varieties of north atlantic fish. mrs. sen took a ticket from the machine at
the counter and waited in line. eliot stood by the lobsters, which stirred one on top of
