both combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip. beowulf tears

howling and yelling with agony and fury. the wound is fatal._

_the next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall
heorot, to hear the news. joy is boundless. glee runs high. hrothgar and
his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts._

_grendel's mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his death. she
is furious and raging. while beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart
[x] from the quarters of the other warriors, she seizes one of hrothgar's
favorite counsellors, and carries him off and devours him. beowulf is
called. determined to leave heorot entirely purified, he arms himself, and
goes down to look for the female monster. after traveling through the
waters many hours, he meets her near the sea-bottom. she drags him to her
