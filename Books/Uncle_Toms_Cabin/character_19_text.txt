she also is dressed with great neatness, and her white, delicate hands
betray very little acquaintance with servile toil. these two are to
be sold tomorrow, in the same lot with the st. clare servants; and the
gentleman to whom they belong, and to whom the money for their sale is
to be transmitted, is a member of a christian church in new york, who
will receive the money, and go thereafter to the sacrament of his lord
and theirs, and think no more of it.

these two, whom we shall call susan and emmeline, had been the personal
attendants of an amiable and pious lady of new orleans, by whom they had
been carefully and piously instructed and trained. they had been taught
to read and write, diligently instructed in the truths of religion, and
their lot had been as happy an one as in their condition it was possible
to be. but the only son of their protectress had the management of her
property; and, by carelessness and extravagance involved it to a
large amount, and at last failed. one of the large

subject. he didnâ€™t like trading in slaves and souls
of men,--of course, he didnâ€™t; but, then, there were thirty thousand
dollars in the case, and that was rather too much money to be lost for a
principle; and so, after much considering, and asking advice from those
that he knew would advise to suit him, brother b. wrote to his lawyer to
dispose of the business in the way that seemed to him the most suitable,
and remit the proceeds.

the day after the letter arrived in new orleans, susan and emmeline
were attached, and sent to the depot to await a general auction on the
following morning; and as they glimmer faintly upon us in the moonlight
which steals through the grated window, we may listen to their
conversation. both are weeping, but each quietly, that the other may not
hear.

â€œmother, just lay your head on my lap, and see if you canâ€™t sleep a
little,â€ says the girl, trying to appear calm.

â€œi havenâ€™t any heart to sleep, em; i canâ€™t; itâ€™s the last night we may
be together!

â€œo, mother, donâ€™t say so! perhaps we shall get sold together,--who
knows?â€

â€œif â€˜t was anybodyâ€™s else case, i should say so, too, em,â€ said the
woman; â€œbut iâ€™m so feard of losinâ€™ you that i donâ€™t see anything but the
danger.â€

â€œwhy, mother, the man said we were both likely, and would sell well.â€

susan remembered the manâ€™s looks and words. with a deadly sickness at
her heart, she remembered how he had looked at emmelineâ€™s hands, and
lifted up her curly hair, and pronounced her a first-rate article. susan
had been trained as a christian, brought up in the daily reading of the
bible, and had the same horror of her childâ€™s being sold to a life
of shame that any other christian mother might have; but she had no
hope,--no protection.

â€œmother, i think we might do first rate, if you could get a place as
cook, and i as chambermaid or seamstress, in some family. i dare say we
shall. letâ€™s both look as bright a

â€œi want you to brush your hair all back straight, tomorrow,â€ said susan.

â€œwhat for, mother? i donâ€™t look near so well, that way.â€

â€œyes, but youâ€™ll sell better so.â€

â€œi donâ€™t see why!â€ said the child.

â€œrespectable families would be more apt to buy you, if they saw you
looked plain and decent, as if you wasnâ€™t trying to look handsome. i
know their ways better â€˜n you do,â€ said susan.

â€œwell, mother, then i will.â€

â€œand, emmeline, if we shouldnâ€™t ever see

is busy and bright, for a lot of goods is to be fitted out for auction.
there is a brisk lookout on the toilet; injunctions passed around
to every one to put on their best face and be spry; and now all are
arranged in a circle for a last review, before they are marched up to
the bourse.

mr. skeggs, with his palmetto on and his cigar in his mouth, walks
around to put farewell touches on his wares.

â€œhowâ€™s this?â€ he said, stepping in front of susan and emmeline. â€œwhereâ€™s
your curls, gal?â€

the girl looked timidly at her mother, who, with the smooth adroitness
common among her class, answers,

â€œi was telling her, last night, to put up her hair smooth and neat, and
not havinâ€™ it flying about in curls; looks more respectable so.â€

â€œbother!â€ said the man, peremptorily, turning to the girl; â€œyou go right
along, and curl yourself real smart!â€ he added, giving a crack to a
rattan he held in his hand, â€œand be back in quick time, too!â€

these, on opposite sides of the area, were now occupied by brilliant and
talented gentlemen, enthusiastically forcing up, in english and french
commingled, the bids of connoisseurs in their various wares. a third
one, on the other side, still unoccupied, was surrounded by a group,
waiting the moment of sale to begin. and here we may recognize the st.
clare servants,--tom, adolph, and others; and there, too, susan and
emmeline, awaiting their turn with anxious and dejected faces. various
spectators, intending to purchase, or not intending, examining, and
commenting on their various points and faces with the same freedom that
a set of jockeys discuss the merits of a horse.

â€œhulloa, alf! what brings you here?â€ said a young exquisite, slapping
the shoulder of a sprucely-dressed young man, who was examining adolph
through an eye-glass.

â€œwhat have you done?â€

â€œhad care of masâ€™râ€™s farm,â€ said tom.

â€œlikely story!â€ said the other, shortly, as he passed on. he paused a
moment before dolph; then spitting a discharge of tobacco-juice on his
well-blacked boots, and giving a contemptuous umph, he walked on. again
he stopped before susan and emmeline. he put out his heavy, dirty hand,
and drew the girl towards him; passed it over her neck and bust, felt
her arms, looked at her teeth, and then pushed her back against her
mother, whose patient face showed the suffering she had been going
through at every motion of the hideous stranger.

the girl was frightened, and began to cry.

â€œstop that, you minx!â€ said the salesman; â€œno whimpering here,--the sale
is going to begin.â€ and accordingly the sale begun.

going this way and that; and then the auction of the trunk, that was
funnier than all, and occasioned abundant witticisms.

this little affair being over, simon sauntered up again to his property.

â€œnow, tom, iâ€™ve relieved you of any extra baggage, you see. take mighty
good care of them clothes. itâ€™ll be long enough â€˜fore you get more. i
go in for making niggers careful; one suit has to do for one year, on my
place.â€

simon next walked up to the place where emmeline was sitting, chained to
another woman.

â€œwell, my dear,â€ he said, chucking her under the chin, â€œkeep up your
spirits.â€

the involuntary look of horror, fright and aversion, with which the girl
regarded him, did not escape his eye. he frowned fiercely.

â€œnone oâ€™ your shines, gal! youâ€™s got to keep a pleasant face, when i
speak to ye,--dâ€™ye hear? and you, you old yellow poco moonshine!â€ he
said, giving a shove to the mulatto woman to whom emmeline was chained,

smiling, â€œbut i advise you not to talk quite so loud, as there are
people on board the boat who might not be quite so tolerant to opinion
as i am. you had better wait till i get up to my plantation, and there
you may abuse us all, quite at your leisure.â€

the young gentleman colored and smiled, and the two were soon busy in a
game of backgammon. meanwhile, another conversation was going on in the
lower part of the boat, between emmeline and the mulatto woman with whom
she was confined. as was natural, they were exchanging with each other
some particulars of their history.

â€œwho did you belong to?â€ said emmeline.

â€œwell, my masâ€™r was mr. ellis,--lived on levee-street. pâ€™raps youâ€™ve
seen the house.â€

â€œwas he good to you?â€ said emmeline.

â€œmostly, till he tuk sick. heâ€™s lain sick, off and on, more than six
months, and been orful oneasy. â€˜pears like he warnt willinâ€™ to have
nobody rest, day or night; and

him. â€˜pears like he just grew crosser, every day; kep me up nights till
i got farly beat out, and couldnâ€™t keep awake no longer; and cause i got

sell me to just the hardest master he could find; and heâ€™d promised me
my freedom, too, when he died.â€

â€œhad you any friends?â€ said emmeline.

â€œyes, my husband,--heâ€™s a blacksmith. masâ€™r genâ€™ly hired him out. they
took me off so quick, i didnâ€™t even have time to see him; and iâ€™s got
four children. o, dear me!â€ said the woman, covering her face with her
hands.

it is a natural impulse, in every one, when they hear a tale of
distress, to think of something to say by way of consolation. emmeline
wanted to say something, but she could not think of anything to say.
what was there to be said? as by a common consent, they bot

true, there is religious trust for even the darkest hour. the mulatto
woman was a member of the methodist church, and had an unenlightened
but very sincere spirit of piety. emmeline had been educated much more
intelligently,--taught to read and write, and diligently instructed in
the bible, by the care of a faithful and pious mistress; yet, would
it not try the faith of the firmest christian, to find themselves
abandoned, apparently, of god, in the grasp of ruthless violence? how
much more must it shake the faith of christâ€™s poor little ones, weak in
knowledge and tender in years!

espair, no words of impassioned prayer, could have had
such a depth of woe in them as the wild notes of the chorus. as if
the poor, dumb heart, threatened,--prisoned,--took refuge in that
inarticulate sanctuary of music, and found there a language in which to
breathe its prayer to god! there was a prayer in it, which simon could
not hear. he only heard the boys singing noisily, and was well pleased;
he was making them â€œkeep up their spirits.â€

â€œwell, my little dear,â€ said he, turning to emmeline, and laying his
hand on her shoulder, â€œweâ€™re almost home!â€

when legree scolded and stormed, emmeline was terrified; but when he
laid his hand on her, and spoke as he now did, she felt as if she had
rather he would strike her. the expression of his eyes made her soul
sick, and her flesh creep. involuntarily she clung closer to the mulatto
woman by her side, as if she were her mother.

â€œyou didnâ€™t ever wear ear-rings,â€ he said, taking hold of her small ear
with his coarse fingers.

â

€œno, masâ€™r!â€ said emmeline, trembling and looking down.

â€œwell, iâ€™ll give you a pair, when we get home, if youâ€™re a good girl.
you neednâ€™t be so frightened; i donâ€™t mean to make you work very hard.
youâ€™ll have fine times with me, and live like a lady,--only be a good
girl.â€

legree had been drinking to that degree that he was inclining to be
very gracious; and it was about this time that the enclosures of the
plantation rose to view. the estate had formerly belonged to a gentleman
of opulence and taste, who

al men are lower even than animals. their coarse,
dark, heavy features; their great eyes, rolling enviously on each other;
their barbarous, guttural, half-brute intonation; their dilapidated
garments fluttering in the wind,--were all in admirable keeping with the
vile and unwholesome character of everything about the place.

â€œhere, you sambo,â€ said legree, â€œtake these yer boys down to the
quarters; and hereâ€™s a gal iâ€™ve got for _you_,â€ said he, as he separated
the mulatto woman from emmeline, and pushed her towards him;--â€œi
promised to bring you one, you know.â€

the woman gave a start, and drawing back, said, suddenly,

â€œo, masâ€™r! i left my old man in new orleans.â€

â€œwhat of that, you--; wonâ€™t you want one here? none oâ€™ your words,--go
long!â€ said legree, raising his whip.

â€œcome, mistress,â€ he said to emmeline, â€œyou go in here with me.â€

a dark, wild face was seen, for a moment, to glance at the window of the
house; and, as legree opened the door, a femal

a quick, imperative tone. tom, who was looking, with anxious interest,
after emmeline, as she went in, noticed this, and heard legree answer,
angrily, â€œyou may hold your tongue! iâ€™ll do as i please, for all you!â€

tom heard no more; for he was soon following sambo to the quarters. the
quarters was a little sort of street of rude shanties, in a row, in
a part of the plantation, far off from the house. they had a forlorn,
brutal, forsaken air. tomâ€™s heart sunk when he saw them. he had been
comforting himself with the thought of a cottage, rude, indeed, but one

â€œyouâ€™ll see,â€ said cassy; â€œwhatâ€™ll you do? tomorrow theyâ€™ll be at you
again. i know â€˜em; iâ€™ve seen all their doings; i canâ€™t bear to think of
all theyâ€™ll bring you to;--and theyâ€™ll make you give out, at last!â€

â€œlord jesus!â€ said tom, â€œyou _will_ take care of my soul? o lord,
do!--donâ€™t let me give out!â€

â€œo dear!â€ said cassy; â€œiâ€™ve heard all this crying and praying before;
and yet, theyâ€™ve been broken down, and brought under. thereâ€™s emmeline,
sheâ€™s trying to hold on, and youâ€™re trying,--but what use? you must give
up, or be killed by inches.â€

â€œwell, then, i _will_ die!â€ said tom. â€œspin it out as long as they can,
they canâ€™t help my dying, some time!--and, after that, they canâ€™t do
no more. iâ€™m clar, iâ€™m set! i _know_ the lordâ€™ll help me, and bring me
through.â€

the woman did not answer; she sat with her black eyes intently fixed on
the floor.

â€œmay be itâ€™s the way,â€ she murmured to herself; â€œbut tho

her silent.

cassy had always kept over legree the kind of influence that a strong,
impassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man; but, of late,
she had grown more and more irritable and restless, under the hideous
yoke of her servitude, and her irritability, at times, broke out into
raving insanity; and this liability made her a sort of object of dread
to legree, who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is
common to coarse and uninstructed minds. when legree brought emmeline to
the house, all the smouldering embers of womanly feeling flashed up in
the worn heart of cassy, and she took part with the girl; and a fierce
quarrel ensued between her and legree. legree, in a fury, swore she
should be put to field service, if she would not be peaceable. cassy,
with proud scorn, declared she _would_ go to the field. and she worked
there one day, as we have described, to show how perfectly she scorned
the threat.

legree was secretly uneasy, all day; for cassy had an influen

a state of furious intoxication, were singing, whooping,

at each other.

she rested her small, slender hand on the window-blind, and looked
fixedly at them;--there was a world of anguish, scorn, and fierce
bitterness, in her black eyes, as she did so. â€œwould it be a sin to rid
the world of such a wretch?â€ she said to herself.

she turned hurriedly away, and, passing round to a back door, glided up
stairs, and tapped at emmelineâ€™s door.



chapter xxxvi

emmeline and cassy


cassy entered the room, and found emmeline sitting, pale with fear,
in the furthest corner of it. as she came in, the girl started up
nervously; but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and catching her
arm, said, â€œo cassy, is it you? iâ€™m so glad youâ€™ve come! i was afraid
it was--. o, you donâ€™t know what a horrid noise there has been, down
stairs, all this evening!â€

â€œi ought to know,â€ said cassy, dryly. â€œiâ€™ve heard it often e

nough.â€

â€œo cassy! do tell me,--couldnâ€™t we get away from this place? i donâ€™t
care where,--into the swamp among the snakes,--anywhere! _couldnâ€™t_ we
get _somewhere_ away from here?â€

â€œnowhere, but into our graves,â€ said cassy.

â€œdid you ever try?â€

â€œiâ€™ve seen enough of trying and what comes of it,â€ said cassy.

â€œiâ€™d be willing to live in the swamps, and gnaw the bark from trees.
i anâ€™t afraid of snakes! iâ€™d rather have one near me than him,â€ said
emmeline, eagerly.

â€œthere have been a good many here of your opinion,â€ said cassy; â€œbut you
couldnâ€™t stay in the swamps,--youâ€™d be tracked by the dogs, and brought
back, and then--then--â€

â€œwhat would he do?â€ said the girl, looking, with breathless interest,
into her face.

â€œwhat _wouldnâ€™t_ he do, youâ€™d better ask,â€ said cassy. â€œheâ€™s learned
his trade well, among the pirates in the west indies. you wouldnâ€™t sleep
much, if i should tell you things iâ€™ve seen,--things that

d screams here that i havenâ€™t been
able to get out of my head for weeks and weeks. thereâ€™s a place way out
down by the quarters, where you can see a black, blasted tree, and the
ground all covered with black ashes. ask anyone what was done there, and
see if they will dare to tell you.â€

â€œo! what do you mean?â€

â€œi wonâ€™t tell you. i hate to think of it. and i tell you, the lord only
knows what we may see tomorrow, if that poor fellow holds out as heâ€™s
begun.â€

â€œhorrid!â€ said emmeline, every drop of blood receding from her cheeks.
â€œo, cassy, do tell me what i shall do!â€

â€œwhat iâ€™ve done. do the best you can,--do what you must,--and make it up
in hating and cursing.â€

â€œhe wanted to make me drink some of his hateful brandy,â€ said emmeline;
â€œand i hate it so--â€

â€œyouâ€™d better drink,â€ said cassy. â€œi hated it, too; and now i canâ€™t live
without it. one must have something;--things donâ€™t look so dreadful,
when you take that.â€

â€œmother used to tell 
 
 ___________________________
 
me never to touch any such thing,â€ said emmeline.

â€œ_mother_ told you!â€ said cassy, with a thrilling and bitter emphasis
on the word mother. â€œwhat use is it for mothers to say anything? you
are all to be bought and paid for, and your souls belong to whoever gets
you. thatâ€™s the way it goes. i say, _drink_ brandy; drink all you can,
and itâ€™ll make things come easier.â€

â€œo, cassy! do pity me!â€

â€œpity you!--donâ€™t i? havenâ€™t i a daughter,--lord knows where she is,
and whose she is, now,--going the way her mother went, before

 her, i
suppose, and that her children must go, after her! thereâ€™s no end to the
curse--forever!â€

â€œi wish iâ€™d never been born!â€ said emmeline, wringing her hands.

â€œthatâ€™s an old wish with me,â€ said cassy. â€œiâ€™ve got used to wishing
that. iâ€™d die, if i dared to,â€ she said, looking out into the darkness,
with that still, fixed despair which was the habitual expression of her
face when at rest.

â€œit would be wicked to kill oneâ€™s self,â€ said emmeline.

â€œi donâ€™t know why,--no wickeder than things we live and do, day after
day. but the sisters told me things, when i was in the convent, that
make me afraid to die. if it would only be the end of us, why, then--â€

emmeline turned away, and hid her face in her hands.

while this conversation was passing in the chamber, legree, overcome
with his carouse, had sunk to sleep in the room below. legree was not an
habitual drunkard. his coarse, strong nature craved, and could endure,
a continual s

his own soul, in darkness and
sorrow. he thought of miss opheliaâ€™s letter to his kentucky friends, and
would pray earnestly that god would send him deliverance. and then he
would watch, day after day, in the vague hope of seeing somebody sent
to redeem him; and, when nobody came, he would crush back to his soul
bitter thoughts,--that it was vain to serve god, that god had forgotten
him. he sometimes saw cassy; and sometimes, when summoned to the house,
caught a glimpse of the dejected form of emmeline, but held very little
communion with either; in fact, there was no time for him to commune
with anybody.

one evening, he was sitting, in utter dejection and prostration, by a
few decaying brands, where his coarse supper was baking. he put a few
bits of brushwood on the fire, and strove to raise the light, and then
drew his worn bible from his pocket. there were all the marked passages,
which had thrilled his soul so often,--words of patriarchs and seers,
poets and sages, who from early time ha

â€œpoor soul!â€ said tom, compassionately. â€œsatan desires to have ye, and
sift ye as wheat. i pray the lord for ye. o! misse cassy, turn to the
dear lord jesus. he came to bind up the broken-hearted, and comfort all
that mourn.â€

cassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped from her downcast
eyes.

â€œmisse cassy,â€ said tom, in a hesitating tone, after surveying her
in silence, â€œif ye only could get away from here,--if the thing was
possible,--iâ€™d â€˜vise ye and emmeline to do it; that is, if ye could go
without blood-guiltiness,--not otherwise.â€

â€œwould you try it with us, father tom?â€

â€œno,â€ said tom; â€œtime was when i would; but the lordâ€™s given me a work
among these yer poor souls, and iâ€™ll stay with â€˜em and bear my cross
with â€˜em till the end. itâ€™s different with you; itâ€™s a snare to
you,--itâ€™s moreâ€™n you can stand,--and youâ€™d better go, if you can.â€

, the moment the doors were
opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light.

this may serve as a specimen of the game that cassy played with legree,
until he would sooner have put his head into a lionâ€™s mouth than to have
explored that garret. meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else
was asleep, cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock
of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she
transferred, article by article, a greater part of her own and
emmelineâ€™s wardrobe. all things being arranged, they only waited a
fitting opportunity to put their plan in execution.

by cajoling legree, and taking advantage of a good-natured interval,
cassy had got him to take her with him to the neighboring town, which
was situated directly on the red river. with a memory sharpened to
almost preternatural clearness, she remarked every turn in the road, and
formed a mental estimate of the time to be occupied in traversing it.

at the time when all was matured for
 
 ___________________________
 
 action, our readers may, perhaps,
like to look behind the scenes, and see the final _coup dâ€™etat_.

it was now near evening, legree had been absent, on a ride to a
neighboring farm. for many days cassy had been unusually gracious and
accommodating in her humors; and legree and she had been, apparently,
on the best of terms. at present, we may behold her and emmeline in the
room of the latter, busy in sorting and arranging two small bundles.

â€œthere, these will be large enough,â€ said cassy. â€œnow put on your bonnet,
and letâ€™s start; itâ€™s just about the right time.â€

â€œwhy, they can see us yet,â€ said emmeline.

â€œi mean they shall,â€ said cassy, coolly. â€œdonâ€™t you know that they must
have their chase after us, at any rate? the way of the thing is to be
just this:--we will steal out of the back door, and run down by the
quarters. sambo or

in at the back door, and up into the garret, where iâ€™ve got a nice
bed made up in one of the great boxes. we must stay in that garret a
good while, for, i tell you, he will raise heaven and earth after us.
heâ€™ll muster some of those old overseers on the other plantations, and
have a great hunt; and theyâ€™ll go over every inch of ground in that
swamp. he makes it his boast that nobody ever got away from him. so let
him hunt at his leisure.â€

â€œcassy, how well you have planned it!â€ said emmeline. â€œwho ever would
have thought of it, but you?â€

there was neither pleasure nor exultation in cassyâ€™s eyes,--only a
despairing firmness.

â€œcome,â€ she said, reaching her hand to emmeline.

the two fugitives glided noiselessly from the house, and flitted,
through the gathering shadows of evening, along by the quarters. the
crescent moon, set like a silver signet in the western sky, delayed a
little the approach of night. as cassy expected, when quite near the
verge of the swamps that enc
 
 ___________________________
 
ircled the plantation, they heard a voice
calling to them to stop. it was not sambo, however, but legree, who was
pursuing them with violent execrations. at the sound, the feebler spirit
of emmeline gave way; and, laying hold of cassyâ€™s arm, she said, â€œo,
cassy, iâ€™m going to faint!â€

â€œif you do, iâ€™ll kill you!â€ said cassy, drawing a small, glittering
stiletto, and flashing it before the eyes of the girl.

the diversion accomplished the purpose. emmeline did not faint, and
succeeded in plunging, with cassy, into a part of the labyrinth of
swamp, so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for legree to
think of following them, without assistance.

â€œwell,â€ said he, chuckling brutally; â€œat any rate, theyâ€™ve got
themselves into a trap now--the baggage! theyâ€™re safe enough. they shall
sweat for it!â€

â€œhulloa, there! sambo! quimbo! all hands!â€ called legree, coming to the
quarters, when the men and women were just returning from

where she belongs; but the gal, not,â€ said legree. â€œand now, boys,
be spry and smart. five dollars for him that gets â€˜em; and a glass of
spirits to every one of you, anyhow.â€

the whole band, with the glare of blazing torches, and whoop, and
shout, and savage yell, of man and beast, proceeded down to the
swamp, followed, at some distance, by every servant in the house. the
establishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when cassy and
emmeline glided into it the back way. the whooping and shouts of their
pursuers were still filling the air; and, looking from the sitting-room
windows, cassy and emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux,
just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp.

â€œsee there!â€ said emmeline, pointing to cassy; â€œthe hunt is begun! look
how those lights dance about! hark! the dogs! donâ€™t you hear? if we were
only _there_, our chances wouldnâ€™t be worth a picayune. o, for pityâ€™s
sake, do l

s hide ourselves. quick!â€

â€œthereâ€™s no occasion for hurry,â€ said cassy, coolly; â€œthey are all
out after the hunt,--thatâ€™s the amusement of the evening! weâ€™ll go up
stairs, by and by. meanwhile,â€ said she, deliberately taking a key
from the pocket of a coat that legree had thrown down in his hurry,
â€œmeanwhile i shall take something to pay our passage.â€

she unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she counted
over rapidly.

â€œo, donâ€™t letâ€™s do that!â€ said emmeline.

â€œdonâ€™t!â€ said cassy; â€œwhy not? would you have us starve in the swamps,
or have that that will pay our way to the free states. money will do
anything, girl.â€ and, as she spoke, she put the money in her bosom.

â€œit would be stealing,â€ said emmeline, in a distressed whisper.

â€œstealing!â€ said cassy, with a scornful laugh. â€œthey who steal body and
soul neednâ€™t talk to us. every one of these bills is stolen,--stolen
from poor, starving, sweating creatures, who must go to the

last, for his profit. let _him_ talk about stealing! but come, we may as
well go up garret; iâ€™ve got a stock of candles there, and some books to
pass away the time. you may be pretty sure they wonâ€™t come _there_ to
inquire after us. if they do, iâ€™ll play ghost for them.â€

when emmeline reached the garret, she found an immense box, in which
some heavy pieces of furniture had once been brought, turned on its
side, so that the opening faced the wall, or rather the eaves. cassy
lit a small lamp, and creeping round under the eaves, they established
themselves in it. it was spread with a couple of small mattresses
and some pillows; a box near by was plentifully stored with candles,
provisions, and all the clothing necessary to their journey, which cassy
had arranged into bundles of

 compass.

â€œthere,â€ said cassy, as she fixed the lamp into a small hook, which she
had driven into the side of the box for that purpose; â€œthis is to be our
home for the present. how do you like it?â€

â€œare you sure they wonâ€™t come and search the garret?â€

â€œiâ€™d like to see simon legree doing that,â€ said cassy. â€œno, indeed; he
will be too glad to keep away. as to the servants, they would any of
them stand and be shot, sooner than show their faces here.â€

somewhat reassured, emmeline settled herself back on her pillow.

â€œwhat did you mean, cassy, by saying you would kill me?â€ she said,
simply.

â€œi meant to stop your fainting,â€ said cassy, â€œand i did do it. and now i
tell you, emmeline, you must make up your mind _not_ to faint, let what
will come; thereâ€™s no sort of need of it. if i had not stopped you, that
wretch might have had his hands on you now.â€

emmeline shuddered.

the two remained some time in silence. cassy busied herself with a
french book; emmelin

tcries, the
tramp of horsesâ€™ feet, and the baying of dogs. she started up, with a
faint shriek.

â€œonly the hunt coming back,â€ said cassy, coolly; â€œnever fear. look out
of this knot-hole. donâ€™t you see â€˜em all down there? simon has to give
up, for this night. look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in the
swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen. ah, my good sir, youâ€™ll
have to try the race again and again,--the game isnâ€™t there.â€

â€œo, donâ€™t speak a word!â€ said emmeline; â€œwhat if they should hear you?â€

â€œif they do hear anything, it will make them very particular to keep
away,â€ said cassy. â€œno danger; we may make any noise we please, and it
will only add to the effect.â€

at length the stillness of midnight settled down over the house. legree,
cursing his ill luck, and vowing dire vengeance on the morrow, went to
bed.

ds dear.
again, we have waited with him in a sunny island, where generous hands
concealed his chains with flowers; and, lastly, we have followed him
when the last ray of earthly hope went out in night, and seen how,
in the blackness of earthly darkness, the firmament of the unseen has
blazed with stars of new and significant lustre.

the morning-star now stands over the tops of the mountains, and gales
and breezes, not of earth, show that the gates of day are unclosing.

the escape of cassy and emmeline irritated the before surly temper of
legree to the last degree; and his fury, as was to be expected, fell
upon the defenceless head of tom. when he hurriedly announced the
tidings among his hands, there was a sudden light in tomâ€™s eye, a sudden
upraising of his hands, that did not escape him. he saw that he did not
join the muster of the pursuers. he thought of forcing him to do it;
but, having had, of old, experience of his inflexibility when commanded
to take part in any deed of inhumanity,

stened, and heard them divide out the ground, discuss the
rival merits of the dogs, give orders about firing, and the treatment of
each, in case of capture.

cassy drew back; and, clasping her hands, looked upward, and said, â€œo,
great almighty god! we are _all_ sinners; but what have _we_ done, more
than all the rest of the world, that we should be treated so?â€

there was a terrible earnestness in her face and voice, as she spoke.

â€œif it wasnâ€™t for _you_, child,â€ she said, looking at emmeline, â€œiâ€™d
_go_ out to them; and iâ€™d thank any one of them that _would_ shoot
me down; for what use will freedom be to me? can it give me back my
children, or make me what i used to be?â€

emmeline, in her child-like simplicity, was half afraid of the dark
moods of cassy. she looked perplexed, but made no answer. she only took
her hand, with a gentle, caressing movement.

â€œdonâ€™t!â€ said cassy, trying to draw it away; â€œyouâ€™ll get me to loving
you; and i never mean to love anything, ag

ain!â€

â€œpoor cassy!â€ said emmeline, â€œdonâ€™t feel so! if the lord gives us
liberty, perhaps heâ€™ll give you back your daughter; at any rate, iâ€™ll be
like a daughter to you. i know iâ€™ll never see my poor old mother again!
i shall love you, cassy, whether you love me or not!â€

the gentle, child-like spirit conquered. cassy sat down by her, put
her arm round her neck, stroked her soft, brown hair; and emmeline then
wondered at the beauty of her magnificent eyes, now soft with tears.

â€œo, em!â€ said cassy, â€œiâ€™ve hungered for my children, and thirsted for
them, and my eyes fail with longing for them! here! here!â€ she said,
striking her breast, â€œitâ€™s all desolate, all empty! if god would give me
back my children, then i could pray.â€

â€œyou must trust him, cassy,â€ said emmeline; â€œhe is our father!â€

â€œhis wrath is upon us,â€ said cassy; â€œhe has turned away in anger.â€

â€œno, c

assy! he will be good to us! let us hope in him,â€ said
emmeline,--â€œi always have had hope.â€


the hunt was long, animated, and thorough, but unsuccessful; and, with
grave, ironic exultation, cassy looked down on legree, as, weary and
dispirited, he alighted from his horse.

â€œnow, quimbo,â€ said legree, as he stretched himself down in the
sitting-room, â€œyou jest go and walk that tom up here, right away! the
old cuss is at the bottom of this yer whole matter; and iâ€™ll have it out
of his old black hide, or iâ€™ll know the reason why!â€

 given with full hearts.

tears had fallen on that honest, insensible face,--tears of late
repentance in the poor, ignorant heathen, whom his dying love and
patience had awakened to repentance, and bitter prayers, breathed over
him to a late-found saviour, of whom they scarce knew more than the
name, but whom the yearning ignorant heart of man never implores in
vain.

cassy, who had glided out of her place of concealment, and, by
overhearing, learned the sacrifice that had been made for her and
emmeline, had been there, the night before, defying the danger of
detection; and, moved by the last few words which the affectionate soul
had yet strength to breathe, the long winter of despair, the ice of
years, had given way, and the dark, despairing woman had wept and
prayed.

when george entered the shed, he felt his head giddy and his heart sick.

â€œis it possible,--is it possible?â€ said he, kneeling down by him.
â€œuncle tom, my poor, poor old friend!â€

something in the voice penetrated to th

d bear the horrors of that sick room, when he raved and
screamed, and spoke of sights which almost stopped the blood of those
who heard him; and, at his dying bed, stood a stern, white, inexorable
figure, saying, â€œcome! come! come!â€

by a singular coincidence, on the very night that this vision appeared
to legree, the house-door was found open in the morning, and some of the
negroes had seen two white figures gliding down the avenue towards the
high-road.

it was near sunrise when cassy and emmeline paused, for a moment, in a
little knot of trees near the town.

cassy was dressed after the manner of the creole spanish ladies,--wholly
in black. a small black bonnet on her head, covered by a veil thick
with embroidery, concealed her face. it had been agreed that, in
their escape, she was to personate the character of a creole lady, and
emmeline that of her servant.

brought up, from early life, in connection with the highest society, the
language, movements and air of cassy, were all in agre

ement with this
idea; and she had still enough remaining with her, of a once splendid
wardrobe, and sets of jewels, to enable her to personate the thing to
advantage.

she stopped in the outskirts of the town, where she had noticed trunks
for sale, and purchased a handsome one. this she requested the man to
send along with her. and, accordingly, thus escorted by a boy wheeling
her trunk, and emmeline behind her, carrying her carpet-bag and sundry
bundles, she made her appearance at the small tavern, like a lady of
consideration.

the first person that struck her, after her arrival, was george shelby,
who was staying there, awaiting the next boat.

cassy had remarked the young man from her loophole in the garret, and
seen him bear away the body of tom, and observed with secret exultation,
his rencontre with legree. subsequently she had gathered, from the
conversations she had overheard among

 or two, madame de thoux told her brother more particularly
of her affairs. the death of her husband had left her an ample fortune,
which she generously offered to share with the family. when she asked
george what way she could best apply it for him, he answered, â€œgive me
an education, emily; that has always been my heartâ€™s desire. then, i can
do all the rest.â€

on mature deliberation, it was decided that the whole family should go,
for some years, to france; whither they sailed, carrying emmeline with
them.

the good looks of the latter won the affection of the first mate of the
vessel; and, shortly after entering the port, she became his wife.

george remained four years at a french university, and, applying himself
with an unintermitted zeal, obtained a very thorough education.

political troubles in france, at last, led the family again to seek an
asylum in this country.

georgeâ€™s feelings and views, as an educated man, may be best expressed
in a letter to one of his friends.

out to be sent to the same market, an older sister
went to the shambles, to plead with the wretch who owned them, for the
love of god, to spare his victims. he bantered her, telling what fine
dresses and fine furniture they would have. â€˜yes,â€™ she said, â€˜that may
do very well in this life, but what will become of them in the next?â€™
they too were sent to new orleans; but were afterwards redeemed, at an
enormous ransom, and brought back.â€ is it not plain, from this, that the
histories of emmeline and cassy may have many counterparts?

justice, too, obliges the author to state that the fairness of mind and
generosity attributed to st. clare are not without a parallel, as
the following anecdote will show. a few years since, a young southern
gentleman was in cincinnati, with a favorite servant, who had been his
personal attendant from a boy. the young man took advantage of this
opportunity to secure his own freedom, and fled to the protection of
a quaker, who was quite noted in affairs of
