[CHARACTER] - 
                 billy's
son, who is a failure and a delinquent at school, though he cleans
up his life enough to become a green beret in the vietnam war. robert's
presence in the story during billy's later life helps illustrate
the pervasiveness of billy's war trauma, especially his inability
to communicate and relate to his own son. robert's successful self-reformation
from delinquency to discipline (in vietnam) seems to indicate vonnegut's acceptance
of the inevitability of war.
