 impatiently.

“oh! well! that isn’t it,” slamming his hat down vehemently upon his
head. “you ought to feel that such things are not flattering to say to a
fellow.”

“should our whole intercourse consist of an exchange of compliments? ma
foi!”

“it isn’t pleasant to have a woman tell you--” he went on, unheedingly,
but breaking off suddenly: “now if i were like arobin-you remember alcee
arobin and that story of the consul’s wife at biloxi?” and he related
the story of alcee arobin and the consul’s wife; and another about the
tenor of the french opera, who received letters which should never
have been written; and still other stories, grave and gay, till mrs.
pontellier and her possible propensity for taking young men seriously
was apparently forgotten.

madame ratignolle, when they had regained her cottage, went in to take
the hour’s rest which she considered helpful. before leaving her, robert
begged her pardon for the impatience--he called it rudeness--with which

and he drew upon this fund of memories so that he might not
be left out and seem wholly devoid of the modern spirit. but he failed
to impose upon the colonel, and was even far from impressing him with
this trumped-up knowledge of bygone days. edna had staked her father
on his last venture, with the most gratifying results to both of them.
besides, they had met some very charming people, according to the
colonel’s impressions. mrs. mortimer merriman and mrs. james highcamp,
who were there with alcee arobin, had joined them and had enlivened the
hours in a fashion that warmed him to think of.

mr. pontellier himself had no particular leaning toward horseracing, and
was even rather inclined to discourage it as a pastime, especially
when he considered the fate of that blue-grass farm in kentucky. he
endeavored, in a general way, to express a particular disapproval, and
only succeeded in arousing the ire and opposition of his father-in-law.

led his old-fashioned cloak
across his breast as he strode home through the darkness. he knew his
fellow-creatures better than most men; knew that inner life which so
seldom unfolds itself to unanointed eyes. he was sorry he had accepted
pontellier’s invitation. he was growing old, and beginning to need rest
and an imperturbed spirit. he did not want the secrets of other lives
thrust upon him.

“i hope it isn’t arobin,” he muttered to himself as he walked. “i hope
to heaven it isn’t alcee arobin.”

edna and her father had a warm, and almost violent dispute upon the
subject of her refusal to attend her sister’s wedding. mr. pontellier
declined to interfere, to interpose either his influence or his
authority. he was following doctor mandelet’s advice, and letting her do
as she liked. the colonel reproached his daughter for her lack of
filial kindness and respect, her want of sisterly affection and womanly
consideration. his arguments were labored and unconvincing. he doub

y or melancholy days edna went out and sought the society of
the friends she had made at grand isle. or else she stayed indoors
and nursed a mood with which she was becoming too familiar for her own
comfort and peace of mind. it was not despair; but it seemed to her as
if life were passing by, leaving its promise broken and unfulfilled.
yet there were other days when she listened, was led on and deceived by
fresh promises which her youth held out to her.

she went again to the races, and again. alcee arobin and mrs. highcamp
called for her one bright afternoon in arobin’s drag. mrs. highcamp was
a worldly but unaffected, intelligent, slim, tall blonde woman in the
forties, with an indifferent manner and blue eyes that stared. she had
a daughter who served her as a pretext for cultivating the society of
young men of fashion. alcee arobin was one of them. he was a familiar
figure at the race course, the opera, the fashionable clubs. there was
a perpetual smile in his eyes, which seldom failed to a

rs in a sort of monotonous agitation.

in the middle of the night she remembered that she had forgotten to
write her regular letter to her husband; and she decided to do so next
day and tell him about her afternoon at the jockey club. she lay wide
awake composing a letter which was nothing like the one which she wrote
next day. when the maid awoke her in the morning edna was dreaming of
mr. highcamp playing the piano at the entrance of a music store on canal
street, while his wife was saying to alcee arobin, as they boarded an
esplanade street car:

“what a pity that so much talent has been neglected! but i must go.”

when, a few days later, alcee arobin again called for edna in his drag,
mrs. highcamp was not with him. he said they would pick her up. but as
that lady had not been apprised of his intention of picking her up, she
was not at home. the daughter was just leaving the house to attend the
meeting of a branch folk lore society, and regretted that she could not
accompany them. arobin a

e dying fire. for a moment or two he kept an impressive
silence.

“your manner has not misled me, mrs. pontellier,” he said finally. “my
own emotions have done that. i couldn’t help it. when i’m near you, how
could i help it? don’t think anything of it, don’t bother, please. you
see, i go when you command me. if you wish me to stay away, i shall do
so. if you let me come back, i--oh! you will let me come back?”

he cast one appealing glance at her, to which she made no response.
alcee arobin’s manner was so genuine that it often deceived even
himself.

edna did not care or think whether it were genuine or not. when she
was alone she looked mechanically at the back of her hand which he had
kissed so warmly. then she leaned her head down on the mantelpiece. she
felt somewhat like a woman who in a moment of passion is betrayed into
an act of infidelity, and realizes the significance of the act without
being wholly awakened from its glamour. the thought was passing vaguely
through he

r mind, “what would he think?”

she did not mean her husband; she was thinking of robert lebrun. her
husband seemed to her now like a person whom she had married without
love as an excuse.

she lit a candle and went up to her room. alcee arobin was absolutely
nothing to her. yet his presence, his manners, the warmth of his
glances, and above all the touch of his lips upon her hand had acted
like a narcotic upon her.

she slept a languorous sleep, interwoven with vanishing dreams.

alcee arobin wrote edna an elaborate note of apology, palpitant with
sincerity. it embarrassed her; for in a cooler, quieter moment it
appeared to her, absurd that she should have taken his action so
seriously, so dramatically. she felt sure that the significance of the
whole occurrence had lain in her own self-consciousness. if she ignored
his note it would give undue importance to a trivial affair. if she
replied to it in a serious spirit it would still leave in his mind
the impression that she had in a s

souffrante and unpresentable, and not foreseeing that madame lebrun
would send a thousand regrets at the last moment. so there were only
ten, after all, which made a cozy, comfortable number.

there were mr. and mrs. merriman, a pretty, vivacious little woman in
the thirties; her husband, a jovial fellow, something of a shallow-pate,
who laughed a good deal at other people’s witticisms, and had thereby
made himself extremely popular. mrs. highcamp had accompanied them. of
course, there was alcee arobin; and mademoiselle reisz had consented
to come. edna had sent her a fresh bunch of violets with black lace
trimmings for her hair. monsieur ratignolle brought himself and his
wife’s excuses. victor lebrun, who happened to be in the city, bent upon
relaxation, had accepted with alacrity. there was a miss mayblunt, no
longer in her teens, who looked at the world through lorgnettes and with
the keenest interest. it was thought and said that she was intellectual;
it was suspected of her that she w

 to me like a child, edna. you seem to act without
a certain amount of reflection which is necessary in this life. that is
the reason i want to say you mustn’t mind if i advise you to be a little
careful while you are living here alone. why don’t you have some one
come and stay with you? wouldn’t mademoiselle reisz come?”

“no; she wouldn’t wish to come, and i shouldn’t want her always with
me.”

“well, the reason--you know how evil-minded the world is--some one was
talking of alcee arobin visiting you. of course, it wouldn’t matter if
mr. arobin had not such a dreadful reputation. monsieur ratignolle was
telling me that his attentions alone are considered enough to ruin a
woman’s name.”

“does he boast of his successes?” asked edna, indifferently, squinting
at her picture.

“no, i think not. i believe he is a decent fellow as far as that goes.
but his character is so well known among the men. i shan’t be able to
come back and see you; it was very, very imprudent to

 first moment you have seemed like the old robert. i’ll
go tell celestine.” she hurried away to tell celestine to set an extra
place. she even sent her off in search of some added delicacy which
she had not thought of for herself. and she recommended great care in
dripping the coffee and having the omelet done to a proper turn.

when she reentered, robert was turning over magazines, sketches,
and things that lay upon the table in great disorder. he picked up a
photograph, and exclaimed:

“alcee arobin! what on earth is his picture doing here?”

“i tried to make a sketch of his head one day,” answered edna, “and
he thought the photograph might help me. it was at the other house. i
thought it had been left there. i must have packed it up with my drawing
materials.”

“i should think you would give it back to him if you have finished with
it.”

“oh! i have a great many such photographs. i never think of returning
them. they don’t amount to anything.” robert kept on looking at
