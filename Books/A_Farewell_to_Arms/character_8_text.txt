 to the front. it was deep and slow there and quite 
narrow. down below there were mosquito marshes 
and canals. there were some lovely villas. once, be- 
fore the war, going up to cortina d'ampezzo i had 
gone along it for several hours in the hills. up there 
it looked like a trout stream, flowing swiftly with shal- 
low stretches and pools under the shadow of the rocks. 
the road turned off from it at cadore. i wondered 
how the army that was up there would come down. 
the barman came in. 

"count greffi was asking for you," he said. 

"who?" 

"count grefifi. you remember the old man who was 
here when you were here before." 

"is he here?" 

"yes, he's here with his niece. i told him you were 
here. he wants you to play billiards." 

"where is he?" 

"he's taking a walk." 

"how is he?" 

"he's younger than ever. he drank three cham- 
pagne cocktails last night before dinner." 

"how's his billiard game?"

to play with." 

count greffi was ninety- four years old. he had 
been a contemporary of metternich and was an old 
man with white hair and mustache and beautiful man- 
ners. he had been in the diplomatic service of both 
austria and italy and his birthday parties were the 
great social event of milan. he was living to be one 
hundred years old and played a smoothly fluent game 
of billiards that contrasted with his own ninety- four- 
year-old brittleness. i had met him when i had been 
at stresa once before out of season a

the stone pier and the bar- 
man pulled in the line, coiling it on the bottom of the 
boat and hooking the spinner on the edge of the gun- 
wale. i stepped out and tied the boat. we went into a 
little cafe, sat at a bare wooden table and ordered ver- 
mouth. 

"are you tired from rowing?" 

"no." 

"i'll row back," he said. 

"i like to row." 

"maybe if you hold the line it will change the luck." 

"all right." 

"tell me how goes the war." 

"rotten." 

"i don't have to go. i'm too old, like count greffi." 

"maybe you'll have to go yet." 

"next year they'll call my class. but i won't go." 

"what will you do?" 

"get out of the country. i wouldn't go to war. i 
was at the war once in abyssinia. nix. why do you 
go? 

"i don't know. i was a fool." 

"have another vermouth?"

"all right." 

the barman rowed back. we trolled up the lake be- 
yond stresa and then down not far from shore. i 
held the taut line and felt the faint pulsing of the spin-

'til be nice to her." 

"i know you will. you're so sweet." 

"she won't stay afterward, will she?" 

"no. i'll get rid of her." 

"and then we'll come up here." 

"of course. what do you think i want to do?" 

we went downstairs to have lunch with ferguson. 
she was very impressed by the hotel and the splendor 
of the dining-room. we had a good lunch with a 
couple of bottles of white capri. count greffi came 
into the dining-room and bowed to us. his niece, who 
looked a little like my grandmother, was with him. i 
told catherine and ferguson about him and ferguson 
was very impressed. the hotel was very big and grand 
and empty but the food was good, the wine was very 
pleasant and finally the wine made us all feel very well. 
catherine had no need to feel any better. she was 
very happy. ferguson became quite cheerful. i felt 
very well myself. after lunch ferguson went back to 
her hotel. s

he was going to lie down for a while after

along late in the afternoon some one knocked on 
our door. 

"who is it?" 

"the count greffi wishes to know if you will play 
billiards with him." 

i looked at my watch ; i had taken it off and it was 
under the pillow. 

"do you have to go, darling?" catherine whispered. 

"i think td better." the watch was a quarter-past 
four o'clock. out loud i said, "tell the count greffi 
i will be in the billiard-room at five o'clock." 

at a quarter to five i kissed catherine good-by and 
went into the bathroom to dress. knotting my tie and

looking in the glass i looked strange to myself in the 
civilian clothes. i must remember to buy some more 
shirts and socks. 

"will you be away a long time?" catherine asked. 
she looked lovely in the bed. "would you hand me the 
brush?" 

i watched her brushing her hair, holding her head so

dark outside and the light over the head of the bed 
shone on her hair and on her neck and shoulders. i 
went over and kissed her and held her hand with the 
brush and her head sunk back on the pillow. i kissed 
her neck and shoulders. i felt faint with loving her so 
much. 

"i don't want to go away." 

"i don't want you to go away." 

"i won't go then." 

"yes. go. it's only for a little while and then 
you'll come back." 

"we'll have dinner up here." 

"hurry and come back." 

i found the count greffi in the billiard-room. he 
was practising strokes, looking very fragile under the 
light that came down above the billiard table. on a card 
table a little way beyond the light was a silver icing- 
bucket with the necks and corks of two champagne 
bottles showing above the ice. the count greffi 
straightened up when i came toward the table and 
walked toward me. he put out his hand, "it is such a 
great pleasure that you are here. you were very kind 
to come to play with me." 

"it was very nice

"have you been playing very much?" 

"none at all." 

"you play very well. ten points in a hundred?" 

"you flatter me." 

"fifteen?" 

"that would be fine but you will beat me." 

"should we play for a stake? you always wished to 
play for a stake." 

"i think we'd better." 

"all right. i will give you eighteen points and we 
will play for a franc a point." 

he played a lovely game of billiards and with the

handicap i was only four ahead at fifty. count greffi 
pushed a button on the wall to ring for the barman. 

"open one bottle please/' he said. then to me, "we 
will take a little stimulant." the wine was icy cold and 
very dry and good. 

"should we talk italian? would you mind very 
much? it is my great weakness now." 

we went on playing, sipping the wine between shots, 
speaking in italian, but talking little, concentrated on 
the game. count greffi made his one hundredth point 
and with the handicap i was only at ninety-four. he 
smiled and p

"no, he doesn't." 

"what?" 

"he doesn't see through it. those books were at the 
hospital." 

"then you have been reading?" 

"yes, but nothing any good." 

"i thought 'mr. britling' a very good study of the 
english middle-class soul." 

"i don't know about the soul." 

"poor boy. we none of us know about the soul. 
are you croyant?" 

"at night."

count greffi smiled and turned the glass with his fin- 
gers. "i had expected to become more devout as i grow 
older but somehow i haven't," he said. "it is a great 
pity." 

"would you like to live after death?" i asked and 
instantly felt a fool to mention death. but he did not 
mind the word. 

"it would depend on the life. this life is very pleas- 
ant. i would like to live forever," he smiled. "i very 
nearly have." 

we were sitting in the deep leather chairs, the cham- 
pagne in the ice-bucket and ou
