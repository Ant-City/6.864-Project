[CHARACTER]

there is a reason that [CHARACTER] gets along so well with his grandchildren, and that is because he is very much like them. his love of life is as great as that of douglas or tom, and since he is more eloquent he is better able to share that love. in some ways [CHARACTER] is the most amazing character in the book. for tom or douglas to love life is no big thing, because almost everyone recalls the joy of childhood. for an old man like [CHARACTER] to take so much pleasure in life is astounding. he brings home the point that life is magical. whether it is through pontificating with bill forrester about the philosophical solitude and solidarity with nature achieved in mowing the lawn, or discussing the features of dandelion wine with his family, grandpa always seems amazed by the world. he has managed to live his life without losing his childish wonder for the world. [CHARACTER] has been through douglas' trials but still retains much of tom, and his contentment may be bradbury's demonstration of what can be expected at the end of a life lived well and full.
