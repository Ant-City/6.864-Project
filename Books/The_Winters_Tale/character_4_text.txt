 i witness to
the times that brought them in; so shall i do
to the freshest things now reigning, and make stale
the glistering of this present, as my tale
now seems to it. your patience this allowing,
i turn my glass, and give my scene such growing
as you had slept between. leontes leaving
the effects of his fond jealousies, so grieving
that he shuts up himself; imagine me,
gentle spectators, that i now may be
in fair bohemia; and remember well,
i mention'd a son o' the king's, which florizel
i now name to you; and with speed so pace
to speak of perdita, now grown in grace
equal with wondering: what of her ensues,
i list not prophesy; but let time's news
be known when 'tis brought forth:--a shepherd's daughter,
and what to her adheres, which follows after,
is the argument of time. of this allow,
if ever you have spent time worse ere now;
if never, yet that time himself doth say
he wishes earnestly you never may.

very services thou hast done; which if i
have not enough considered,--as too much i cannot,--to be more
thankful to thee shall be my study; and my profit therein the
heaping friendships. of that fatal country sicilia, pr'ythee,
speak no more; whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance
of that penitent, as thou call'st him, and reconciled king, my
brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are
even now to be afresh lamented. say to me, when sawest thou the
prince florizel, my son? kings are no less unhappy, their issue
not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have
approved their virtues.

camillo.
sir, it is three days since i saw the prince. what his happier
affairs may be, are to me unknown; but i have missingly noted
he is of late much retired from court, and is less frequent to
his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

polixenes.
i have considered so much, camillo, and with some care; so
far that i have eyes under

why, then comes in the sweet o' the year:
  for the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.

the white sheet bleaching on the hedge,--
  with, hey! the sweet birds, o, how they sing!--
doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
  for a quart of ale is a dish for a king.

the lark, that tirra-lirra chants,--
  with, hey! with, hey! the thrush and the jay,--
are summer songs for me and my aunts,
  while we lie tumbling in the hay.

i have serv'd prince florizel, and in my time wore three-pile;
but now i am out of service:

but shall i go mourn for that, my dear?

and when i wander here and there,
  i then do most go right.

humbling their deities to love, have taken
the shapes of beasts upon them: jupiter
became a bull and bellow'd; the green neptune
a ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god,
golden apollo, a poor humble swain,
as i seem now:--their transformations
were never for a piece of beauty rarer,--
nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
burn hotter than my faith.

bright phoebus in his strength,--a malady
most incident to maids; bold oxlips, and

your praises are too large: but that your youth,
and the true blood which peeps fairly through it,
do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd,

he's simple and tells much. [to florizel.] how now, fair shepherd!
your heart is full of something that does take
your mind from feasting. sooth, when i was young
and handed love as you do, i was wont
to load my she with knacks: i would have ransack'd
the pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
to her acceptance; you have let him go,
and nothing marted with him. if your lass
interpretation should abuse, and call this
your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
for a reply, at least if you make a care
of happy holding

she prizes not such trifles as these are:
the gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
up in my heart; which i have given already,
but not deliver'd.--o, hear me breathe my life
before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
hath sometime lov'd,--i take thy hand! this hand,
as soft as dove's down, and as white as it,
or ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd snow that's bolted
by the northern blasts twice o'er.

thereof most worthy; were i the fairest youth

methinks a father
is, at the nuptial of his son, a guest
that best becomes the table. pray you, once more;
is not your father grown incapable
of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
with age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
know man from man? dispute his own estate?
lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
but what he did being childish?

florizel.

he has his health, and ampler strength indeed
than most have of his age.

the father,--all whose joy is nothing else
but fair posterity,--should hold some counsel
in such a business.

florizel.
                            how, camillo,

and, after that, trust to thee.

camillo.
                                have you thought on
