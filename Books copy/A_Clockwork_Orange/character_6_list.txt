Lodger - 
                Played
by Clive Francis
                The young man who moves into
Alex's room when Alex goes to prison. The lodger is strapping, healthy,
good-looking, and sanctimonious. He tells Alex with self-righteous indignation
that he has made his poor parents suffer enough, and that he is
not welcome back in his home. He tells him that he himself has become
like the good son Alex never was.
