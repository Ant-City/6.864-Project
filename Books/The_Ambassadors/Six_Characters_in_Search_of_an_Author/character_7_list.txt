Madame Pace  - 
      The Step-Daughter's exploitative Madame. Pace is a fat, older woman with "puffy oxygenated hair." She is "rouged and powdered" and wears black silk with a "comical elegance." A pair of scissors hangs from a silver chain at her waist. Conjured out of nowhere in Act II, Pace is an apparition, her birth an exercise in what the Father describes as the magic of the stage. In translation, she speaks a comically broken English.
