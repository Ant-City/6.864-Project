the importance of being earnest
a trivial comedy for serious people

first act

scene

morning-room in algernon’s flat in half-moon street.  the room is luxuriously and artistically furnished.  the sound of a piano is heard in the adjoining room.

[lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has ceased, algernon enters.]

algernon.  did you hear what i was playing, lane?

lane.  i didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.

algernon.  i’m sorry for that, for your sake.  i don’t play accurately—any one can play accurately—but i play with wonderful expression.  as far as the piano is concerned, sentiment is my forte.  i keep science for life.

lane.  yes, sir.

algernon.  and, speaking of the science of life, have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for lady bracknell?

lane.  yes, sir.  [hands them on a salver.]

algernon.  [inspects them, takes two, and sits do

wn on the sofa.]  oh! . . . by the way, lane, i see from your book that on thursday night, when lord shoreman and mr. worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed.

lane.  yes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.

algernon.  why is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne?  i ask merely for information.

lane.  i attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir.  i have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first-rate brand.

algernon.  good heavens!  is marriage so demoralising as that?

lane.  i believe it is a very pleasant state, sir.  i have had very little experience of it myself up to the present.  i have only been married once.  that was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person.

algernon.  [languidly.]  i don’t know that

i am much interested in your family life, lane.

lane.  no, sir; it is not a very interesting subject.  i never think of it myself.

algernon.  very natural, i am sure.  that will do, lane, thank you.

lane.  thank you, sir.  [lane goes out.]

algernon.  lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax.  really, if the lower orders don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them?  they seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.

[enter lane.]

lane.  mr. ernest worthing.

[enter jack.]

[lane goes out.]

algernon.  how are you, my dear ernest?  what brings you up to town?

jack.  oh, pleasure, pleasure!  what else should bring one anywhere?  eating as usual, i see, algy!

algernon.  [stiffly.]  i believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o’clock.  where have you been since last thursday?

jack.  [sitting down on the sofa.]  in the country.

algernon.  what on earth do you do there?

jack.  [pulling

n.  it isn’t.  it is a great truth.  it accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that one sees all over the place.  in the second place, i don’t give my consent.

jack.  your consent!

algernon.  my dear fellow, gwendolen is my first cousin.  and before i allow you to marry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of cecily.  [rings bell.]

jack.  cecily!  what on earth do you mean?  what do you mean, algy, by cecily!  i don’t know any one of the name of cecily.

[enter lane.]

algernon.  bring me that cigarette case mr. worthing left in the smoking-room the last time he dined here.

lane.  yes, sir.  [lane goes out.]

jack.  do you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time?  i wish to goodness you had let me know.  i have been writing frantic letters to scotland yard about it.  i was very nearly offering a large reward.

algernon.  well, i wish you would offer one.  i happen to be more than usually hard up.

jack.  there is no good offering a large

reward now that the thing is found.

[enter lane with the cigarette case on a salver.  algernon takes it at once.  lane goes out.]

algernon.  i think that is rather mean of you, ernest, i must say.  [opens case and examines it.]  however, it makes no matter, for, now that i look at the inscription inside, i find that the thing isn’t yours after all.

jack.  of course it’s mine.  [moving to him.]  you have seen me with it a hundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside.  it is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case.

algernon.  oh! it is absurd to have a

beastly competition about.  [the sound of an electric bell is heard.]  ah! that must be aunt augusta.  only relatives, or creditors, ever ring in that wagnerian manner.  now, if i get her out of the way for ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to gwendolen, may i dine with you to-night at willis’s?

jack.  i suppose so, if you want to.

algernon.  yes, but you must be serious about it.  i hate people who are not serious about meals.  it is so shallow of them.

[enter lane.]

lane.  lady bracknell and miss fairfax.

[algernon goes forward to meet them.  enter lady bracknell and gwendolen.]

lady bracknell.  good afternoon, dear algernon, i hope you are behaving very well.

algernon.  i’m feeling very well, aunt augusta.

lady bracknell.  that’s not quite the same thing.  in fact the two things rarely go together.  [sees jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]

algernon.  [to gwendolen.]  dear me, you are smart!

gwendolen.  i am always smart!  am i not, mr.

all on dear lady harbury.  i hadn’t been there since her poor husband’s death.  i never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years younger.  and now i’ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me.

algernon.  certainly, aunt augusta.  [goes over to tea-table.]

lady bracknell.  won’t you come and sit here, gwendolen?

gwendolen.  thanks, mamma, i’m quite comfortable where i am.

algernon.  [picking up empty plate in horror.]  good heavens!  lane!  why are there no cucumber sandwiches?  i ordered them specially.

lane.  [gravely.]  there were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.  i went down twice.

algernon.  no cucumbers!

lane.  no, sir.  not even for ready money.

algernon.  that will do, lane, thank you.

lane.  thank you, sir.  [goes out.]

algernon.  i am greatly distressed, aunt augusta, about there being no cucumbers, not even for ready money.

lady bracknell.  it really makes no matter, algernon.  i had some crumpets

algernon.  what shall we do after dinner?  go to a theatre?

jack.  oh no!  i loathe listening.

algernon.  well, let us go to the club?

jack.  oh, no!  i hate talking.

algernon.  well, we might trot round to the empire at ten?

jack.  oh, no!  i can’t bear looking at things.  it is so silly.

algernon.  well, what shall we do?

jack.  nothing!

algernon.  it is awfully hard work doing nothing.  however, i don’t mind hard work where there is no definite object of any kind.

[enter lane.]

lane.  miss fairfax.

[enter gwendolen.  lane goes out.]

algernon.  gwendolen, upon my word!

gwendolen.  algy, kindly turn your back.  i have something very particular to say to mr. worthing.

algernon.  really, gwendolen, i don’t think i can allow this at all.

gwendolen.  algy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life.  you are not quite old enough to do that.  [algernon retires to the fireplace.]

jack.  my own darling!

gwendolen.  ernest, we may never be married.  f

s a good postal service, i suppose?  it may be necessary to do something desperate.  that of course will require serious consideration.  i will communicate with you daily.

jack.  my own one!

gwendolen.  how long do you remain in town?

jack.  till monday.

gwendolen.  good!  algy, you may turn round now.

algernon.  thanks, i’ve turned round already.

gwendolen.  you may also ring the bell.

jack.  you will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?

gwendolen.  certainly.

jack.  [to lane, who now enters.]  i will see miss fairfax out.

lane.  yes, sir.  [jack and gwendolen go off.]

[lane presents several letters on a salver to algernon.  it is to be surmised that they are bills, as algernon, after looking at the envelopes, tears them up.]

algernon.  a glass of sherry, lane.

lane.  yes, sir.

algernon.  to-morrow, lane, i’m going bunburying.

lane.  yes, sir.

algernon.  i shall probably not be back till monday.  you can put up my dress clothes, my smoking jacket, and all t

lane.  yes, sir.  [handing sherry.]

algernon.  i hope to-morrow will be a fine day, lane.

lane.  it never is, sir.

algernon.  lane, you’re a perfect pessimist.

lane.  i do my best to give satisfaction, sir.

[enter jack.  lane goes off.]

jack.  there’s a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl i ever cared for in my life.  [algernon is laughing immoderately.]  what on earth are you so amused at?

algernon.  oh, i’m a little anxious about poor bunbury, that is all.

jack.  if you don’t take care, your friend bunbury will get you into a serious scrape some day.

algernon.  i love scrapes.  they are the only things that are never serious.

jack.  oh, that’s nonsense, algy.  you never talk anything but nonsen
