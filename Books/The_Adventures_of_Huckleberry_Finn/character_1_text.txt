dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods southwestern dialect; the
ordinary â€œpike countyâ€ dialect; and four modified varieties of this

guesswork; but painstakingly, and with the trustworthy guid

huckleberry finn

scene:  the mississippi valley time:  forty to fifty years ago




chapter i.

you donâ€™t know about me without you have read a book by the name of the
adventures of tom sawyer; but that ainâ€™t no matter.  that book was made
by mr. mark twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  there was things
which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  that is nothing.  i
never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was aunt
polly, or the widow, or maybe mary.  aunt polly--tomâ€™s aunt polly, she
is--and mary, and the widow douglas is all told about in that book, which
is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as i said before.

now the way that the book winds

ge thatcher he took it and put it out
at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  the widow douglas
she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was
rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when i couldnâ€™t stand
it no longer i lit out.  i got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead
again, and was free and satisfied.  but tom sawyer he hunted me up and
said he was going to start a band of robbers, and i might join if i
would go back to the widow and be respectable.  so i went back.

the widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she
called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by
it. she put me in them new clothes again, and i couldnâ€™t do nothing but
sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  well, then, the old thing
commenced again.  the widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to

to go to the good place.
 well, i couldnâ€™t see no advantage in going where she was going, so i
made up my mind i wouldnâ€™t try for it.  but i never said so, because it
would only make trouble, and wouldnâ€™t do no good.

now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good
place.  she said all a body would have to do there was to go around all
day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  so i didnâ€™t think
much of it. but i never said so.  i asked her if she reckoned tom sawyer
would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  i was glad
about that, because i wanted him and me to be together.

miss watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.
 by and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then
everybody was off to bed.  i went up to my room with a piece of candle,
and put it on the table.  then i set down in a chair by the window and
tried to think of something cheerful, but it warnâ€™t no use.  i felt
so lonesome i most wishe

m--boom--boom--twelve licks; and all still again--stiller than
ever. pretty soon i heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the
trees--something was a stirring.  i set still and listened.  directly i
could just barely hear a â€œme-yow! me-yow!â€ down there.  that was good!
 says i, â€œme-yow! me-yow!â€ as soft as i could, and then i put out the
light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  then i slipped
down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,
there was tom sawyer waiting for me.




chapter ii.

we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
the widowâ€™s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldnâ€™t scrape our
heads. when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made
a noise.  we scrouched down and laid still.  miss watsonâ€™s big nigger,
named jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty
clear, because there was a light behind him.  he got up and stretched
his neck out about a minute, listen

hem a hole in the hill, right in the thickest
part of the bushes.  then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our
hands and knees.  we went about two hundred yards, and then the cave
opened up. tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
under a wall where you wouldnâ€™t a noticed that there was a hole.  we
went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and
sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  tom says:

â€œnow, weâ€™ll start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyerâ€™s gang.
everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name
in blood.â€

everybody was willing.  so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
wrote the oath on, and read it.  it swore every boy to stick to the
band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and
his family must do it, and he mustnâ€™t eat and he mustnâ€™t sleep till he
had killed them and hacked a cross in their bre

as a real beautiful oath, and asked tom if he got
it out of his own head.  he said, some of it, but the rest was out of
pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had
it.

some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told
the secrets.  tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote
it in. then ben rogers says:

â€œhereâ€™s huck finn, he hainâ€™t got no family; what you going to do â€˜bout
him?â€

â€œwell, hainâ€™t he got a father?â€ says tom sawyer.

â€œyes, heâ€™s got a father, but you canâ€™t never find him these days.  he
used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hainâ€™t been seen
in these parts for a year or more.â€

they talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they
said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it
wouldnâ€™t be fair and square for the others.  well, nobody could think of
anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  i was most ready
to cry; but all at once i

them miss
watson--they could kill her.  everybody said:

â€œoh, sheâ€™ll do.  thatâ€™s all right.  huck can come in.â€

then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,
and i made my mark on the paper.

â€œnow,â€ says ben rogers, â€œwhatâ€™s the line of business of this gang?â€

â€œnothing only robbery and murder,â€ tom said.

â€œbut who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--â€

â€œstuff! stealing cattle and such things ainâ€™t robbery; itâ€™s burglary,â€
 says tom sawyer.  â€œwe ainâ€™t burglars.  that ainâ€™t no sort of style.  we
are highwaymen.  we stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks
on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.â€

â€œmust we always kill the people?â€

â€œoh, certainly.  itâ€™s best.  some authorities think different, but
mostly itâ€™s considered best to kill them--except some that you bring to
the cave here, and keep them till theyâ€™re ransomed.â€

â€œransomed?  whatâ€™s that?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know.  but thatâ€

™s what they do.  iâ€™ve seen it in books; and so
of course thatâ€™s what weâ€™ve got to do.â€

â€œbut how can we do it if we donâ€™t know what it is?â€

â€œwhy, blame it all, weâ€™ve _got_ to do it.  donâ€™t i tell you itâ€™s in the
books?  do you want to go to doing different from whatâ€™s in the books,
and get things all muddled up?â€

â€œoh, thatâ€™s all very fine to _say_, tom sawyer, but how in the nation
are these fellows going to be ransomed if we donâ€™t know how to do it
to them?--thatâ€™s the thing i want to get at.  now, what do you reckon it
is?â€

â€œwell, i donâ€™t know.  but perâ€™aps if we keep them till theyâ€™re ransomed,
it means that we keep them till theyâ€™re dead.â€

â€œnow, thatâ€™s something _like_.  thatâ€™ll answer.  why couldnâ€™t you said
that before?  weâ€™ll keep them till theyâ€™re ransomed to death; and a
bothersome lot theyâ€™ll be, too--eati

m cry-baby, and that made him
mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets.  but
tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and
meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.

ben rogers said he couldnâ€™t get out much, only sundays, and so he wanted
to begin next sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it
on sunday, and that settled the thing.  they agreed to get together and
fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected tom sawyer first
captain and jo harper second captain of the gang, and so started home.

i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
breaking. my new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and i was
dog-tired.




chapter iii.

well, i got a good going-over in the morning from old miss watson on
account of my clothes; but the widow she didnâ€™t scold, but only cleaned
off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that i thought i would
behave awhile if i could.  then miss watson she to

a woman dressed up in a manâ€™s clothes.  so i was uncomfortable again.
 i judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though i wished he
wouldnâ€™t.

we played robber now and then about a month, and then i resigned.  all
the boys did.  we hadnâ€™t robbed nobody, hadnâ€™t killed any people, but
only just pretended.  we used to hop out of the woods and go charging
down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,
but we never hived any of them.  tom sawyer called the hogs â€œingots,â€
 and he called the turnips and stuff â€œjulery,â€ and we would go to the
cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many people we had killed
and marked.  but i couldnâ€™t see no profit in it.  one time tom sent a
boy to run about town with a blazing stick, which he called a slogan
(which was the sign for the gang to get together), and then he said he
had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of spanish
merchants and rich a-rabs was going t

 it warnâ€™t anything but a sunday-school picnic, and only a primer-class
at that.  we busted it up, and chased the children up the hollow; but we
never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though ben rogers got
a rag doll, and jo harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and then the
teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.

 i didnâ€™t see no diâ€™monds, and i told tom sawyer so.  he said there was
loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was a-rabs there, too,
and elephants and things.  i said, why couldnâ€™t we see them, then?  he
said if i warnâ€™t so ignorant, but had read a book called don quixote, i
would know without asking.  he said it was all done by enchantment.  he
said there was hundreds of soldiers there, and elephants and treasure,
and so on, but we had enemies which he called magicians; and they had
turned the whole thing into an infant sunday-s

chool, just out of spite.
 i said, all right; then the thing for us to do was to go for the
magicians.  tom sawyer said i was a numskull.

â€œwhy,â€ said he, â€œa magician could call up a lot of genies, and they
would hash you up like nothing before you could say jack robinson.  they
are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.â€

â€œwell,â€ i says, â€œsâ€™pose we got some genies to help _us_--canâ€™t we lick
the other crowd then?â€

â€œhow you going to get them?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know.  how do _they_ get them?â€

â€œwhy, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies
come tearing
 
 ___________________________
 


â€œshucks, it ainâ€™t no use to talk to you, huck finn.  you donâ€™t seem to
know anything, somehow--perfect saphead.â€

i thought all this over for two or three days, and then i reckoned i
would see if there was anything in it.  i got an old tin lamp and an
iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till i sweat
like an injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warnâ€™t
no use, none of the genies come.  so then i judged that all that stuff
was only just one of tom sawyerâ€™s lies.  i reckoned he believed in the
a-rabs and the elephants, but as for me i think different.  it had all
the marks of a sunday-school.




chapter iv.

well, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter
now. i had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and
write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six
times seven is thirty-five, and i donâ€™t reckon i could ever get any
further than that if i was to live forever.  i donâ€™t ta

n, and took him back nearly
to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down
on the ground to bleed; i say ground because it was ground--hard packed,
and no boards.  well, next i took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks
in it--all i could drag--and i started it from the pig, and dragged it to
the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and
down it sunk, out of sight.  you could easy see that something had been
dragged over the ground.  i did wish tom sawyer was there; i knowed he
would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy
touches.  nobody could spread himself like tom sawyer in such a thing as
that.

well, last i pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and
stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  then i
took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldnâ€™t
drip) till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into
the river.  now i thought of something

 about her husband, and about her relations up
the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better
off they used to was, and how they didnâ€™t know but theyâ€™d made a mistake
coming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,
till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what
was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the
murder, and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.
 she told about me and tom sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only
she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what
a hard lot i was, and at last she got down to where i was murdered.  i
says:

â€œwho done it?  weâ€™ve heard considerable about these goings on down in
hookerville, but we donâ€™t know who â€˜twas that killed huck finn.â€

â€œwell, i reckon thereâ€™s a right smart chance of people _here_ thatâ€™d
like to know who killed him.  some think old finn done it himself.â€

â€œno--is that so?â

couldnâ€™t say nothing to that, so he didnâ€™t try.  â€œand besides,â€ i says,
â€œwe might borrow something worth having out of the captainâ€™s stateroom.
 seegars, i bet you--and cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  steamboat
captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ donâ€™t
care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  stick a
candle in your pocket; i canâ€™t rest, jim, till we give her a rummaging.
 do you reckon tom sawyer would ever go by this thing?  not for pie, he
wouldnâ€™t. heâ€™d call it an adventure--thatâ€™s what heâ€™d call it; and heâ€™d
land on that wreck if it was his last act.  and wouldnâ€™t he throw style
into it?--wouldnâ€™t he spread himself, nor nothing?  why, youâ€™d think it
was christopher câ€™lumbus discovering kingdom-come.  i wish tom sawyer
_was_ here.â€

jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  he said we mustnâ€™t talk any more
than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  the lightni

t, boys; i swear i wonâ€™t ever tell!â€

another voice said, pretty loud:

â€œitâ€™s a lie, jim turner.  youâ€™ve acted this way before.  you always want
moreâ€™n your share of the truck, and youâ€™ve always got it, too, because
youâ€™ve swore â€˜t if you didnâ€™t youâ€™d tell.  but this time youâ€™ve said
it jest one time too many.  youâ€™re the meanest, treacherousest hound in
this country.â€

by this time jim was gone for the raft.  i was just a-biling with
curiosity; and i says to myself, tom sawyer wouldnâ€™t back out now,
and so i wonâ€™t either; iâ€™m a-going to see whatâ€™s going on here.  so i
dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft
in the dark till there warnâ€™t but one stateroom betwixt me and the
cross-hall of the texas.  then in there i see a man stretched on the
floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one
of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.
 this one kept pointing the pistol at the manâ€™s hea

the house; i know it, because she told me so herself.â€

â€œall right,â€ they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and
give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.

everything was all right now.  the girls wouldnâ€™t say nothing because
they wanted to go to england; and the king and the duke would ruther
mary jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of
doctor robinson.  i felt very good; i judged i had done it pretty neat--i
reckoned tom sawyer couldnâ€™t a done it no neater himself.  of course he
would a throwed more style into it, but i canâ€™t do that very handy, not
being brung up to it.

well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end
of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man
he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the
auctioneer, and chipping in a little scripture now and then, or a little
goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was aroun

.  after all
this long journey, and after all weâ€™d done for them scoundrels, here it
was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because
they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that, and make
him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty
dirty dollars.

once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to
be a slave at home where his family was, as long as heâ€™d _got_ to be a
slave, and so iâ€™d better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to
tell miss watson where he was.  but i soon give up that notion for two
things: sheâ€™d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness
for leaving her, and so sheâ€™d sell him straight down the river again;
and if she didnâ€™t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger,
and theyâ€™d make jim feel it all the time, and so heâ€™d feel ornery and
disgraced. and then think of _me_!  it would get all around that huck
finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if i w

he sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give mrs.
phelps the chance she wanted.  she stooped down quick at the foot of the
bed and give me a pull, and out i come; and when he turned back from the
window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and
i standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.  the old gentleman stared,
and says:

â€œwhy, whoâ€™s that?â€

â€œwho do you reckon â€˜t is?â€

â€œi hainâ€™t no idea.  who _is_ it?â€

â€œitâ€™s _tom sawyer!_â€

by jings, i most slumped through the floor!  but there warnâ€™t no time to
swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on
shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about sid, and mary,
and the rest of the tribe.

but if they was joyful, it warnâ€™t nothing to what i was; for it was like
being born again, i was so glad to find out who i was.  well, they froze
to me for two hours; and at

my family--i mean the
sawyer family--than ever happened to any six sawyer families.  and i
explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of
white river, and it took us three days to fix it.  which was all right,
and worked first-rate; because _they_ didnâ€™t know but what it would take
three days to fix it.  if iâ€™d a called it a bolthead it would a done
just as well.

now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty
uncomfortable all up the other.  being tom sawyer was easy and
comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a
steamboat coughing along down the river.  then i says to myself, sâ€™pose
tom sawyer comes down on that boat?  and sâ€™pose he steps in here any
minute, and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep
quiet?

well, i couldnâ€™t _have_ it that way; it wouldnâ€™t do at all.  i must go
up the road and waylay him.  so i told the folks i reckoned i would go
up to the town and fetch down my baggage.  the

chapter xxxiii.

so i started for town in the wagon, and when i was half-way i see a
wagon coming, and sure enough it was tom sawyer, and i stopped and
waited till he come along.  i says â€œhold on!â€ and it stopped alongside,
and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed
two or three times like a person thatâ€™s got a dry throat, and then says:

â€œi hainâ€™t ever done you no harm.  you know that.  so, then, what you
want to come back and haâ€™nt _me_ for?â€

i says:

â€œi hainâ€™t come back--i hainâ€™t been _gone_.â€

when he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warnâ€™t quite

he says:

â€œwhat!  why, jim is--â€

he stopped and went to studying.  i says:

â€œi know what youâ€™ll say.  youâ€™ll say itâ€™s dirty, low-down business; but
what if it is?  iâ€™m low down; and iâ€™m a-going to steal him, and i want
you keep mum and not let on.  will you?â€

his eye lit up, and he says:

â€œiâ€™ll _help_ you steal him!â€

well, i let go all holts then, like i was shot.  it was the most
astonishing speech i ever heard--and iâ€™m bound to say tom sawyer fell
considerable in my estimation.  only i couldnâ€™t believe it.  tom sawyer
a _nigger-stealer!_

â€œoh, shucks!â€  i says; â€œyouâ€™re joking.â€

â€œi ainâ€™t joking, either.â€

â€œwell, then,â€ i says, â€œjoking or no joking, if you hear anything said
about a runaway nigger, donâ€™t forget to remember that _you_ donâ€™t know
nothing about him, and i donâ€™t know nothing about him.â€

then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his
way and i drove mine.  but of cours

everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger
donâ€™t come _every_ year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for
interest, when he does come.  tom was over the stile and starting for
the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we
was all bunched in the front door.  tom had his store clothes on, and an
audience--and that was always nuts for tom sawyer.  in them circumstances
it warnâ€™t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
suitable.  he warnâ€™t a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,
he come caâ€™m and important, like the ram.  when he got a-front of us he
lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box
that had butterflies asleep in it and he didnâ€™t want to disturb them,
and says:

â€œmr. archibald nichols, i presume?â€

â€œno, my boy,â€ says the old gentleman, â€œiâ€™m sorry to

i warnâ€™t feeling so brash as i was
before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though
i hadnâ€™t done nothing.  but thatâ€™s always the way; it donâ€™t make no
difference whether you do right or wrong, a personâ€™s conscience ainâ€™t
got no sense, and just goes for him anyway.  if i had a yaller dog that
didnâ€™t know no more than a personâ€™s conscience does i would pison him.
it takes up more room than all the rest of a personâ€™s insides, and yet
ainâ€™t no good, nohow.  tom sawyer he says the same.




chapter xxxiv.

we stopped talking, and got to thinking.  by and by tom says:

â€œlooky here, huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!  i bet i
know where jim is.â€

â€œno!  where?â€

â€œin that hut down by the ash-hopper.  why, looky here.  when we was at
dinner, didnâ€™t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwhat did you think the vittles was for?â€

â€œfor a dog.â€

â€œso â€˜d i. well, it wasnâ€™t for a dog.â€

â€œwhy?â€

 table--same key, i bet.  watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;
and it ainâ€™t likely thereâ€™s two prisoners on such a little plantation,
and where the peopleâ€™s all so kind and good.  jimâ€™s the prisoner.  all
right--iâ€™m glad we found it out detective fashion; i wouldnâ€™t give shucks
for any other way.  now you work your mind, and study out a plan to
steal jim, and i will study out one, too; and weâ€™ll take the one we like
the best.â€

what a head for just a boy to have!  if i had tom sawyerâ€™s head i
wouldnâ€™t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown
in a circus, nor nothing i can think of.  i went to thinking out a plan,
but only just to be doing something; i knowed very well where the right
plan was going to come from.  pretty soon tom says:

â€œready?â€

â€œyes,â€ i says.

â€œall right--bring it out.â€

â€œmy plan is this,â€ i says.  â€œwe can easy find out if itâ€™s jim in there.
then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the

worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make jim just as free a man
as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.  so i was satisfied,
and said we would waltz in on it.  i neednâ€™t tell what it was here,
because i knowed it wouldnâ€™t stay the way, it was.  i knowed he would be
changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance.  and that is what he done.

well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that tom sawyer was in
earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.
that was the thing that was too many for me.  here was a boy that was
respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at
home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and
knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,
without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to
this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,

 the match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and
the door was locked as good as ever. tom was joyful.  he says;

â€œnow weâ€™re all right.  weâ€™ll _dig_ him out.  it â€˜ll take about a week!â€

then we started for the house, and i went in the back door--you only have
to pull a buckskin latch-string, they donâ€™t fasten the doors--but that
warnâ€™t romantical enough for tom sawyer; no way would do him but he must
climb up the lightning-rod.  but after he got up half way about three
times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most
busted his brains out, he thought heâ€™d got to give it up; but after he
was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this
time he made the trip.

in the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins
to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jim--if it
_was_ jim that was

cut their hand off and shoved.  and a leg would
be better still.  but we got to let that go.  there ainâ€™t necessity
enough in this case; and, besides, jimâ€™s a nigger, and wouldnâ€™t
understand the reasons for it, and how itâ€™s the custom in europe; so
weâ€™ll let it go.  but thereâ€™s one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we
can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.  and we
can send it to him in a pie; itâ€™s mostly done that way.  and iâ€™ve et
worse pies.â€

â€œwhy, tom sawyer, how you talk,â€ i says; â€œjim ainâ€™t got no use for a
rope ladder.â€

â€œhe _has_ got use for it.  how _you_ talk, you better say; you donâ€™t
know nothing about it.  heâ€™s _got_ to have a rope ladder; they all do.â€

â€œwhat in the nation can he _do_ with it?â€

â€œ_do_ with it?  he can hide it in his bed, canâ€™t he?â€  thatâ€™s what they
all do; and _heâ€™s_ got to, too.  huck, you donâ€™t ever seem to want to do
anything thatâ€™s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all

for a clew, after heâ€™s gone? and donâ€™t you reckon theyâ€™ll want clews?
 of course they will.  and you wouldnâ€™t leave them any?  that would be a
_pretty_ howdy-do, _wouldnâ€™t_ it!  i never heard of such a thing.â€

â€œwell,â€ i says, â€œif itâ€™s in the regulations, and heâ€™s got to have
it, all right, let him have it; because i donâ€™t wish to go back on no
regulations; but thereâ€™s one thing, tom sawyer--if we go to tearing up
our sheets to make jim a rope ladder, weâ€™re going to get into trouble
with aunt sally, just as sure as youâ€™re born.  now, the way i look at
it, a hickry-bark ladder donâ€™t cost nothing, and donâ€™t waste nothing,
and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick,
as any rag ladder you can start; and as for jim, he ainâ€™t had no
experience, and so he donâ€™t care what kind of a--â€

â€œoh, shucks, huck finn, if i was as ignorant as you iâ€™d keep

ig in under it, and
when we got through there couldnâ€™t nobody in the cabin ever know there
was any hole there, because jimâ€™s counter-pin hung down most to the
ground, and youâ€™d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.
 so we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then
we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldnâ€™t see
weâ€™d done anything hardly.  at last i says:

â€œthis ainâ€™t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,
tom sawyer.â€

he never said nothing.  but he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped
digging, and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking.
then he says:

â€œit ainâ€™t no use, huck, it ainâ€™t a-going to work.  if we was prisoners
it would, because then weâ€™d have as many years as we wanted, and no
hurry; and we wouldnâ€™t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while
they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldnâ€™t get blistered, and
we could keep it up right along, year in and ye

o put in another
night this way weâ€™d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get
well--couldnâ€™t touch a case-knife with them sooner.â€

â€œwell, then, what we going to do, tom?â€

â€œiâ€™ll tell you.  it ainâ€™t right, and it ainâ€™t moral, and i wouldnâ€™t like
it to get out; but there ainâ€™t only just the one way:  we got to dig him
out with the picks, and _let on_ itâ€™s case-knives.â€

â€œ_now_ youâ€™re _talking_!â€  i says; â€œyour head gets leveler and leveler
all the time, tom sawyer,â€ i says.  â€œpicks is the thing, moral or no
moral; and as for me, i donâ€™t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.
 when i start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a sunday-school
book, i ainâ€™t no ways particular how itâ€™s done so itâ€™s done.  what i
want is my nigger; or what i want is my watermelon; or what i want is my
sunday-school book; and if a pickâ€™s the handiest thing, thatâ€™s the thing
iâ€™m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sunday-school
book

er the _border_--thatâ€™s what weâ€™d a done with _him_--and
done it just as slick as nothing at all, too.  man the sweeps--man the
sweeps!â€

but me and jim was consulting--and thinking.  and after weâ€™d thought a
minute, i says:

â€œsay it, jim.â€

so he says:

â€œwell, den, dis is de way it look to me, huck.  ef it wuz _him_ dat â€˜uz
beinâ€™ sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, â€˜go on
en save me, nemmine â€˜bout a doctor fâ€™r to save dis one?â€™  is dat like

den, is _jim_ gywne to say it?  no, sah--i doanâ€™ budge a step outâ€™n dis
place â€˜dout a _doctor_, not if itâ€™s forty year!â€

i knowed he was white inside, and i reckoned heâ€™d say what he did say--so
it was all right now, and i told tom i was a-going for a doctor.
 he raised considerable row about it, but me and jim stuck to it and
wouldnâ€™t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose
himself; but we wouldnâ€™t let

â€œthe one i got yesterday out of the post-office.â€

â€œno, you didnâ€™t give me no letter.â€

â€œwell, i must a forgot it.â€

so he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had
laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  she says:

â€œwhy, itâ€™s from st. petersburg--itâ€™s from sis.â€

i allowed another walk would do me good; but i couldnâ€™t stir.  but
before she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see
something. and so did i. it was tom sawyer on a mattress; and that old
doctor; and jim, in _her_ calico dress, with his hands tied behind him;
and a lot of people.  i hid the letter behind the first thing that come
handy, and rushed.  she flung herself at tom, crying, and says:

â€œoh, heâ€™s dead, heâ€™s dead, i know heâ€™s dead!â€

and tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,
which showed he warnâ€™t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,
and says:

â€œheâ€™s alive, thank god!  and thatâ€™s enough!â€

 at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting
sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the
oldest man in the world couldnâ€™t a understood it.  so tomâ€™s aunt polly,
she told all about who i was, and what; and i had to up and tell how
i was in such a tight place that when mrs. phelps took me for tom
sawyer--she chipped in and says, â€œoh, go on and call me aunt sally, iâ€™m
used to it now, and â€˜tainâ€™t no need to changeâ€--that when aunt sally took
me for tom sawyer i had to stand it--there warnâ€™t no other way, and
i knowed he wouldnâ€™t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being
a mystery, and heâ€™d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly
satisfied.  and so it turned out, and he let on to be sid, and made
things as soft as he could for me.

and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting
jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, tom sawyer had gone and took
all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and i c
