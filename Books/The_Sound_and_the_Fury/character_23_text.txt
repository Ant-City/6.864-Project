sunday?"   
     "i reckon the police wont get me for wearing my new suit one time," i 
said.   
     "i was thinking about the square students. they'll think you go to 
harvard. have you got too proud to at tend classes too?"   
     "i'm going to eat first." the shadow on the stoop was gone. i stepped 
into sunlight, finding my shadow again. i walked down the steps just ahead 
of it. the half hour went. then the chimes ceased and died away.   
     deacon wasn't at the postoffice either. i stamped the two envelopes and 
mailed the one to father and put shreve's in my inside pocket, and then i 
remembered where i had last seen the deacon. it was on decoration day, 
in a g.a.r. uniform, in the middle of the parade. if you waited long enough 
on any corner you would see him in whatever parade came along. the one 
before was on columbus' or garibaldi's or somebody's birthday. he was in 
the street sweepers' section, in a stovepipe hat, carrying a tw

he hadn't quite recovered from the parade, for he gave me a salute, a very 
superior-officerish kind.   
     "i want to see you a minute," i said, stopping.   
     "see me? all right. see you again, fellows," he said, stopping and turning 
back; "glad to have chatted with you." that was the deacon, all over. talk 
about your natural psychologists. they said he hadn't missed a train at the 
beginning of school in forty years, and that he could pick out a southerner 
with one glance. he never missed, and once he had heard you speak, he 
could name your state. he had a regular uniform he met trains in, a sort of 
uncle tom's cabin outfit, patches and all.

     "and on that wop holiday too," i said. "you were obliging the w. c. t.

     "that? i was doing that for my son-in-law. he aims to get a job on the

you saw me, did you?"   
     "both times. yes."   
     "i mean, in uniform. how'd i look?"   
     "you looked fine. you looked better than any of them. they ought to 
make you a general, deacon."   
     he touched my arm, lightly, his hand that worn, gentle quality of 
niggers' hands. "listen. this aint for outside talking. i dont mind telling 
you because you and me's the same folks, come long and short." he leaned 
a little to me, speaking rapidly, his eyes not looking at me. "i've got strings 
out, right now. wait till next year. just wait. then see where i'm marching. 
i wont need to tell you how i'm fixing it; i say, just wait and see, my boy."

years ago for nothing. my son-in-law on the city; me-- yes, sir. if just 
turning democrat'll make that son of a bitch go to work.... and me: just you 
stand on that corner yonder a year from two days ago, and see."   
     "i hope so. you deserve it, deacon. and while i think about it--" i took 
the letter from my pocket. "take this around to my room tomorrow and 
give it to shreve. he'll have something for you. but not till 
tomorrow,mind."   
     he took the letter and examined it. "it's sealed up."   
     "yes. and it's written inside, not good until tomorrow."   
     "h'm," he said. he looked at the envelope, his mouth pursed.

     "i hope--" i said. he looked down at me, benignant, profound. suddenly 
i held out my hand and we shook, he gravely, from the pompous height of 
his municipal and military dream. "you're a good fellow, deacon. i hope.... 
you've helped a lot of young fellows, here and there."   
     "i've tried to treat all folks right," he said. "i draw no petty social lines. a 
man to me is a man, wherever i find him."   
     "i hope you'll always find as many friends as you've made."   
     "young fellows. i get along with them. they dont forget me, neither," he

whyn't you keep them hands outen your pockets when you running you 
could stand up then   rolling his head in the cradle rolling it flat across the 
back. caddy told jason and versh that the reason uncle maury didn't work 
was that he used to roll his head in the cradle when he was little.   
     shreve was coming up the walk, shambling, fatly earnest, his glasses 
glinting beneath the running leaves like little pools.   
     "i gave deacon a note for some things. i may not be in this afternoon, so 
dont you let him have anything until tomorrow, will you?"   
     "all right." he looked at me. "say, what're you doing today, anyhow? all
