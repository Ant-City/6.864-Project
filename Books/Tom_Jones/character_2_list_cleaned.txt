mr.[CHARACTER] 
 - 
                mr. allworthy is just what his name implies - all worthy. allworthy has a 
reputation throughout england because of his benevolent, altruistic behavior. 
the moral yardstick of the novel, allworthy's only fault (which ironically 
propels much of the plot) is that--due to his goodness--he cannot 
perceive the evil in others.
