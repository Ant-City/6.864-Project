 his cause in arms, to conquer or to die.
  my right and his are in dispute: the slain
  fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.
  in equal arms let us alone contend;
  and let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend.
  this is the way (so tell him) to possess
  the royal virgin, and restore the peace.
  bear this message back, with ample leave,
  that your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive."

  thus having said- th' embassadors, amaz'd,
  stood mute a while, and on each other gaz'd.
  drances, their chief, who harbor'd in his breast
  long hate to turnus, as his foe profess'd,
  broke silence first, and to the godlike man,
  with graceful action bowing, thus began:
  "auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name,
  but yet whose actions far transcend your fame;
  would i your justice or your force express,
  thought can but equal; and all words are less.
  your answer we shall thankfully relate,
  and favors granted to the latian state.
  if wish'd success our labor shall attend,

k peace concluded, and the king your friend:
  let turnus leave the realm to your command,
  and seek alliance in some other land:
  build you the city which your fates assign;
  we shall be proud in the great work to join."

  thus drances; and his words so well persuade
  the rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made.
  twelve days the term allow'd: and, during those,
  latians and trojans, now no longer foes,
  mix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare
  to fell the timber, and forget the war.
  loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound;
  oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;
  first fall from high; and some the trunks receive
  in loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.

  and now the fatal news by fame i

  all in that universal sorrow share,
  and curse the cause of this unhappy war:
  a broken league, a bride unjustly sought,
  a crown usurp'd, which with their blood is bought!
  these are the crimes with which they load the name
  of turnus, and on him alone exclaim:
  "let him who lords it o'er th' ausonian land
  engage the trojan hero hand to hand:
  his is the gain; our lot is but to serve;
  't is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve."
  this drances aggravates; and adds, with spite:
  "his foe expects, and dares him to the fight."
  nor turnus wants a party, to support
  his cause and credit in the latian court.
  his former acts secure his present fame,
  and the queen shades him with her mighty name.

  while thus their factious minds with fury burn,
  the legates from th' aetolian prince return:
  sad news they bring, that, after all the cost
  and care employ'd, their embassy is lost;
  that diomedes refus'd his aid in war,
  unmov'd w

terials are at hand; a well-grown wood
  runs equal with the margin of the flood:
  let them the number and the form assign;
  the care and cost of all the stores be mine.
  to treat the peace, a hundred senators
  shall be commission'd hence with ample pow'rs,
  with olive the presents they shall bear,
  a purple robe, a royal iv'ry chair,
  and all the marks of sway that latian monarchs wear,
  and sums of gold. among yourselves debate
  this great affair, and save the sinking state."

  then drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since,
  the rising glories of the daunian prince.
  factious and rich, bold at the council board,
  but cautious in the field, he shunn'd the sword;
  a close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord.
  noble his mother was, and near the throne;
  but, what his father's parentage, unknown.
  he rose, and took th' advantage of the times,
  to load young turnus with invidious crimes.
  "such truths, o king," said he, "your words contain,
  as strike the sense, and all r

  permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew
  should share such triumphs, and detain from you
  the post of honor, your undoubted due.
  rather alone your matchless force employ,
  to merit what alone you must enjoy."

  these words, so full of malice mix'd with art,
  inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart.
  then, groaning from the bottom of his breast,
  he heav'd for wind, and thus his wrath express'd:
  "you, drances, never want a stream of words,
  then, when the public need requires our swords.
  first in the council hall to steer the state,
  and ever foremost in a tongue-debate,
  while our strong walls secure us from the foe,
  ere yet with blood our ditches overflow:
  but let the potent orator declaim,
  and with the brand of coward blot my name;
  free leave is giv'n him, when his fatal hand
  has cover'd with more corps the sanguine strand,
  and high as mine his tow'ring trophies stand.

  our foes encourage, and our friends debase.
  believe thy fables, and the trojan town
  triumphant stands; the grecians are o'erthrown;
  suppliant at hector's feet achilles lies,
  and diomede from fierce aeneas flies.
  say rapid aufidus with awful dread
  runs backward from the sea, and hides his head,
  when the great trojan on his bank appears;
  for that's as true as thy dissembled fears
  of my revenge. dismiss that vanity:
  thou, drances, art below a death from me.
  let that vile soul in that vile body rest;
  the lodging is well worthy of the guest.

  "now, royal father, to the present state
  of our affairs, and of this high debate:
  if in your arms thus early you diffide,
  and think your fortune is already tried;
  if one defeat has brought us down so low,
  as never more in fields to meet the foe;
  then i conclude for peace: 't is time to treat,
  and lie like vassals at the victor's feet.

  and i alone will answer his demand.
  drances shall rest secure, and neither share
  the danger, nor divide the prize of war."

  while they debate, nor these nor those will yield,
  aeneas draws his forces to the field,
  and moves his camp. the scouts with flying speed
  return, and thro' the frighted city spread
  th' unpleasing news, the trojans are descried,
  in battle marching by the river side,
  and bending to the town. they take th' alarm:
  some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm.

  these eyes beheld murranus bite the ground:
  mighty the man, and mighty was the wound.
  i heard my dearest friend, with dying breath,
  my name invoking to revenge his death.
  brave ufens fell with honor on the place,
  to shun the shameful sight of my disgrace.
  on earth supine, a manly corpse he lies;
  his vest and armor are the victor's prize.
  then, shall i see laurentum in a flame,
  which only wanted, to complete my shame?
  how will the latins hoot their champion's flight!
  how drances will insult and point them to the sight!
  is death so hard to bear? ye gods below,
  (since those above so small compassion show,)
  receive a soul unsullied yet with shame,
  which not belies my great forefather's name!"

  he said; and while he spoke, with flying speed
  came sages urging on his foamy steed:
  fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore,
  and, seeking turnus, sent his voice before:
  "turnus, on you, on you alone, depends
  our last relief: compassionate your friends!
