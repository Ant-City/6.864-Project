lves trotted howling into the clearing. all of a sudden there 
were hundreds of eyes looking at them. still dori did not let bilbo down. he waited till he 
had clambered off his shoulders into the branches, and then he jumped for the branches 
himself. only just in time! a wolf snapped- at his cloak as he swung up, and nearly got 
him. in a minute there was a whole pack of them yelping all round the tree and leaping 
up at the trunk, with eyes blazing and tongues hanging out. 
but even the wild wargs (for so the evil wolves over the edge of the wild were named) 
cannot climb trees. for a time they were safe. 'luckily it was warm and not windy. trees 
are not very comfortable to sit in for long at any time; but in the cold and the wind, with 
wolves all round below waiting for you, they can be perfectly miserable places. 
this glade in the ring of trees was evidently a meeting-place of the wolves. more and 
more kept coming in. they left guards at the foot of the tree in which dori and bilbo

were, and then went sniffling about till they had smelt out every tree that had anyone in 
it. these they guarded too, while all the rest (hundreds and hundreds it seemed) went 
and sat in a great circle in the glade; and in the middle of the circle was a great grey 
wolf. he spoke to them in the dreadful language of the wargs. gandalf understood it. 
bilbo did not, but it sounded terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about cruel and 
wicked things, as it was. every now and then all the wargs in the circle would answer 
their grey chief all together, and their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of 
his pine-tree. 
i will tell you what gandalf heard, though bilbo did not understand it. 
the wargs and the goblins often helped one another in wicked deeds. goblins do not

om their mountains, unless they are driven out and are looking 
for new homes, or are marching to war (which i am glad to say has not happened for a 
long while). but in those days they sometimes used to go on raids, especially to get food 
or slaves to work for them. then they often got the wargs to help and shared the 
plunder with them. sometimes they rode on wolves like men do on horses. now it 
seemed that a great goblin-raid had been planned for that very night. the wargs had 
come to meet the goblins and the goblins were late. the reason, no doubt, was the 
death of the great goblin, and all the excitement caused by the dwarves and bilbo and 
the wizard, for whom they were probably still hunting. 

in spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their way back 
into it from the south, cutting down trees, and building themselves places to live in 
among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the river-shores. there were

 of them, and they were brave and wellarmed, and even the wargs dared not 
attack them if there were many together, or in the bright day. but now they had planned 
with the goblins' help to come by night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains. 
if their plan had been carried out, there would have been none left there next day; all 
would have been killed except the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried back 
as prisoners to their caves. 
this was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen and their 
wives and child

ren, but also because of the danger which now threatened gandalf and 
his friends. the wargs were angry and puzzled at finding them here in their very 
meeting-place. they thought they were friends of the woodmen, and were come to spy 
on them, and would take news of their plans down into the valleys, and then the goblins 
and the wolves would have to fight a terrible battle instead of capturing prisoners and 
devouring people waked suddenly from their sleep. so the wargs had no intention of 
going away and letting the people up the trees escape, at any rate not until morning. and 
long before that, they said, goblin soldiers would be coming down from the mountains; 
and goblins can climb trees, or cut them down. 
now you can understand why gandalf, listening to their growling and yelping, began to 
be dreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and to feel that they were in a very bad 
place, and had not yet escaped at all. all the same he was not going to let the

and yammering and looking for water. 
"what's all this uproar in the forest tonight?" said the lord of the eagles. he was sitting, 
black in the moonlight, on the top of a lonely pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the 
mountains. "i hear wolves' voices! 
are the goblins at mischief in the woods?" 
he swept up into the air, and immediately two of his guards from the rocks at either hand 
leaped up to follow him. they circled up in the sky and looked down upon the ring of the 
wargs, a tiny spot far far below. but eagles have keen eyes and can see small things at 
a great distance. the lord of the eagles of the misty mountains had eyes that could look 
at the sun unblinking, and could see a rabbit moving on the ground a mile below even in 
the moonlight. so though he could not see the people in the trees, he could make out 

the commotion among the wolves and see the tiny flashes of fire, and hear the howling 
and yelping come up faint from far beneath him. also he could

n, down, down towards the ring of 
the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins. 
a very good thing too! dreadful things had been going on down there. the wolves that 
had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places. it was high 
summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some 
time. yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-needles, and here and there 
dead trees, were soon in flames. 
all round the clearing of the wargs fire was leaping. but the wolf-guards did not leave 
the trees. maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and 
cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out, and their 
eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames. 
then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. they thought a battle with the woodmen 
was going on; but they goon learned what had really happened. some of them actually 
sat down and laughed. others waved their spears and c

er, to get from this bank to the carrock by the ford, but 
on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. i had to walk miles before 
i found a place where the river was wide and shallow enough for me to wade and swim, 
and then miles back again to pick up the tracks again. by that time it was too late for me 
to follow them far. 
they went straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the misty 
mountains, where we had our pleasant little party with the wargs the night before last. 
and now i think i have answered your first question, too," ended gandalf, and he sat a 
long while silent. 
bilbo thought he knew what the wizard meant. "what shall we do," he cried, "if he leads 
all the wargs and the goblins down here? we shall all be caught and killed! i thought 
you said he was not 9 friend of theirs." 

"so i did. and don't be silly! you had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy." 
the hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to

dwarves were still singing songs he dropped asleep, still puzzling his little 
head about beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of black bears dancing slow 
heavy dances round and round in the moonlight in the courtyard. then he woke up when 
everyone else was asleep, and he heard the same scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and 
growling as before. next morning they were all wakened by beorn himself. 
"so here you all are still!" he said. he picked up the hobbit and laughed: "not eaten up 
by wargs or goblins or wicked bears yet i see"; and he poked mr. baggins' waistcoat 
most disrespectfully. "little bunny is getting nice and fat again on bread and honey," he 
chuckled. "come and have some more!" 
so they all went to breakfast with him. beorn was most jolly for a change; indeed he 
seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and set them all laughing with his funny 
stories; nor did they have to wonder long where he had been or why he was so nice to 
them, for he told them himself. he had

been over the river and right back up into the 
mountains-from which you can guess that he could travel quickly, in bear's shape at any 
rate. from the burnt wolfglade he had soon found out that part of their story was true; 
but he had found more than that: he had caught a warg and a goblin wandering in the 
woods. from these he had got news: the goblin patrols were still hunting with 
wargs for the dwarves, and they were fiercely angry because of the death of the great 
goblin, and also because of the burning of the chief wolf's nose and the death from the 
wizard's fire of many of his chief servants. so much they told him when he forced them, 
but he guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot, and that a great raid of the 
whole goblin army with their wolfallies into the lands shadowed by the mountains might 
soon be made to find the dwarves, or to take vengeance on the me

 at a place a few days' ride due north of the carrock was the gate of a little-
known pathway through mirkwood that led almost straight towards the lonely mountain. 
"the goblins," beorn had said, "will not dare to cross the great river for a hundred miles 
north of the carrock nor to come near my house - it is well protected at night!- but i 
should ride fast; for if they make their raid soon they will cross the river to the south and 
scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you off, and wargs run swifter than ponies. 
still you are safer going north, even though you seem to be going back nearer to their 
strongholds; for that is what they will least expect, and they will have the longer ride to 
catch you. be off now as quick as you may!" 
that is why they were now riding in silence, galloping wherever the ground was grassy 
and smooth, with the mountains dark on their left, and in the distance the line of the river 
with its trees drawing ever closer. the sun had only just turned w

cried gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted, 
between the advancing dwarves and the ranks awaiting them. "halt!" he called in a voice 
like thunder, and his staff blazed forth with a flash like the lightning. "dread has come 
upon you all! alas! it has come more swiftly than i guessed. the goblins are upon you! 
bolg of the north is coming. 
o dain! whose father you slew in moria. behold! the bats are above his army like a sea 
of locusts. they ride upon wolves and wargs are in their train!" 
amazement and confusion fell upon them all. even as gandalf had been speaking the 
darkness grew. the dwarves halted and gazed at the sky. the elves cried out with many 
voices. 
"come!" called gandalf. "there is yet time for council. let dain son of nain come swiftly 
to us!" 
so began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the battle of five armies, 
and it was very terrible. upon one side were the goblins and the wild wolves, and upon 
the other were elves a

slopes above the gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless of those 
that fell screaming from cliff and precipice, to attack the spurs from above. each of these 
could be reached by paths that ran down from the main mass of the mountain in the 
centre; and the defenders had too few to bar the way for long. victory now vanished 
from hope. they had only stemmed the first onslaught of the black tide. 
day drew on. the goblins gathered again in the valley. there a host of wargs came 
ravening and with them came the bodyguard of bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars 
of steel. soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while still the great bats 
swirled about the heads and ears of elves and men, or fastened vampire-like on the 
stricken. now bard was fighting to defend the eastern spur, and yet giving slowly back; 
and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the southern arm, near to the watch-
post on ravenhill. 
suddenly there was a great shout,

okes, and nothing seemed to harm him. 
"to me! to me! elves and men! to me! o my kinsfolk!" he cried, and his voice shook 
like a horn in the valley. 
down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of dain to his help. down too came 
many of the lake-men, for bard could not restrain them; and out upon the other side 
came many of the spearmen of the elves. once again the goblins were stricken in the 

valley; and they were piled in heaps till dale was dark and hideous with their corpses. 
the wargs were scattered and thorin drove right against the bodyguards of bolg. but 
he could not pierce their ranks. 
already behind him among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many 
a fair elf that should have lived yet long ages merrily in the wood. and as the valley 
widened his onset grew ever slower. his numbers were too few. 
his flanks were unguarded. soon the attackers were attacked, and they were forced into 
a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all about with goblins and wol

d well guarded-the wizard was with him, and beorn for much of the way-and 
he was never in great danger again. anyway by mid-winter gandalf and bilbo had come 
all the way back, along both edges of the forest, to the doors of beorn's house; and 
there for a while they both stayed. yule-tide was warm and merry there; and men came 
from far and wide to feast at beorn's bidding. the goblins of the misty mountains were 
now few and terrified, and hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and the wargs 
had vanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear. beorn indeed 
became a great chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the 
mountains and the wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had 
the power of taking bear's shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in 
heart like beorn, if less in size and strength. in their day the last goblins were hunted 
from the misty mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the w
