ere's the book. . . . just read it out as well as you can, and we'll do whatever the book says," sörine encouraged her husband. she seemed to have taken charge of the ceremony, and spoke in low, reassuring tones, as if she had done nothing else all her life but attend to such duties; and it was her confidence that gave hans olsa the courage he needed. . . . he went up to the table, took the book, and read the ritual in a trembling voice, slowly, with many pauses. and so he christened the child peder victorious, pronouncing the name clearly. whereupon he said the lord's prayer so beautifully, that kjersti exclaimed she had never heard the like.

"there, now!" said kjersti with great emphasis. "i don't believe there is a thing lacking to make this christening perfectly correct! . . . now the coffee is ready and we're all going to have a cup."

but per hansa was searching over in the corner; at last he produced a bottle. first he treated sörine; then kjersti. . . . "if ever two people have earned somet

s wife had made a practical suggestion; per hansa found little to say, but his face had a look of quiet elation. . . . he must speak to beret about this, alone and right away! . . . he sat there trying the name over in his mind, first on her, then on himself, finally on each of the children. as he ran them over, the radiant light in his face grew stronger. . . . mrs. holm, that sounded well; peder holm, that had a fine ring! . . . ole haldor holm! . . . hans kristian holm! . . . peder holm--no, peder victorious holm! . . . peder victorious holm! . . . he rolled the name on his tongue, biting it off in three distinct parts, as if to enjoy the sound; then he got up suddenly, grasped the waistband of his trousers, and gave them a hitch.

. . . "sörrina has got it right--that name is both pretty and practical. what do you say, boys--shall we adopt the plan?"

per hansa was plainly in a towering humour now; the note of it rang in his voice. there was no opposing him. . . . after that day, each of the two

ariably wrote it with a "w" instead of a "v."

 

that night beret sat quietly by herself. the chores were long since done and they had eaten their supper. the children were in bed. they had been very noisy tonight, in their excitement over the new name that sörine had invented for them. but now they were all asleep. per hansa was getting ready to go to bed; he moved about abstractedly and took a long time over everything he did. he, too, was full of excitement, thinking about the name. . . .

peder victorious holm--the words sang through his mind; he seemed to expand as he heard them. the song carried him forward into the great, imaginative future where he loved to dwell. . . . "beret, please come to bed!" he begged, in a low, kindly voice. he caressed his wife affectionately, then went to the bed and lay down.

she returned the caress half-heartedly, as if reserving the better part of it. "oh yes, i'll come pretty soon," she said, and remained sitting where she was.

she sat there a long time, hold

d trade with the indians, making what profit he could. god knows, he needed it! . . . and what was to hinder? flandreau lay only forty miles away; from there to worthington was perhaps another ninety miles; and there at worthington stood the train, waiting for him! . . . the days were growing longer; there was nothing to do at home for a while; and the weather wouldn't be too bad for a journey. . . . here were the furs; in minnesota lay the profits. any courageous devil could pull it off. . . . peder victorious--the name sang in his ears. peder victorious!

ning two bright blue eyes toward the minister; he laughed aloud and asked sörine who that man was with the whiskers and the long black skirt? sörine tried by petting him to hush him up. . . . "he doesn't have any pants!" said the boy, still laughing and putting his arms around her neck; those who stood near enough to overhear were doubled up with mirth.

but as the pastor asked the child's name and she gave it, and he repeated it clearly and distinctly, so as to be heard throughout the room--"peder victorious, dost thou renounce--" . . . something extraordinary happened. from out that pale face over in the corner came a sound of anguish. beret rose up and pushed her way violently through the crowd, which moved aside in sudden alarm to let her pass, then closed immediately in behind her; per hansa tried to follow, but found it hard to make a passage through the throng, which now was crowding forward in order to get a better view; and all at once her voice, shrill and vibrant, pierced the room: "this

why we had to baptize him at once. in my heedless joy, after the worst was over and things had turned out all right, i went and gave him that second name. . . . and then everything seemed to go to pieces!"

"that name . . . ?"

"yes, the second name. it was very wrong of me, i know. i see that now."

"what are you saying, man? such a beautiful name!"

per hansa looked at him. . . . "do you really mean it?"

"of course i mean it! it is the handsomest name i can ever remember giving to any child. peder victorious--why, it sings like a beautiful melody!"

"please tell me--is it really a human name? and wasn't it a sacrilege on my part?" asked per hansa, incredulously, hardly daring yet to acknowledge his joy.

"my dear man, have you worried about that, too?"

"have i? . . . don't mention it! . . . you mean that the name is all right?"

"yes, indeed," said the minister without hesitation. "there is nothing unusual about it, except that you have happened to find a more beautiful form than i have yet heard;

't pay much attention to what he said. certainly he could go. they would look after everything. they went on with their work, and soon fell into a quarrel about how long it would take them to reach the pigsty. . . . he left the boys, took his skis, and went into the granary; there he rubbed one pair of skis with some tallow which he kept for the purpose, and put a piece of the tallow into his pocket. he also had to adjust the straps a little before he could start. . . .

while he was doing this peder victorious came trudging in and announced that mother had made coffee. she said father must come in before it got cold.

"what?" . . . per hansa's face brightened. "did mother really say that?"

"she said coffee was ready."

"oh! . . ."

per hansa had now adjusted the straps as he wanted them, and stood looking around for a rope with which to strap the other pair of skis on his back.

"did she send you out and tell you to say that?" . . .

"she said--she said--coffee was ready, she said!"
