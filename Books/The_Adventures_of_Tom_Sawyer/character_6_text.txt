griefs were at an end. he so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of
these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;
and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,
and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. and such a luxury to
him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any
worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too
sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin mary danced
in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit
of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness
out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.

he wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate
places that were in harmony with his spirit. a log raft in the river
invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated
the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could

, as from sinai.

then tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to �get
his verses.� sid had learned his lesson days before. tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
sermon on the mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.
at the end of half an hour tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,
but no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
thought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. mary took
his book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the
fog:

�blessed are the--a--a--�

�poor�--

�yes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a--�

�in spirit--�

�in spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they--they--�

�for _theirs_. blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom

�oh, tom, you poor thick-headed thing, i�m not teasing you. i wouldn�t
do that. you must go and learn it again. don�t you be discouraged, tom,
you�ll manage it--and if you do, i�ll give you something ever so nice.
there, now, that�s a good boy.�

�all right! what is it, mary, tell me what it is.�

�never you mind, tom. you know if i say it�s nice, it is nice.�

�you bet you that�s so, mary. all right, i�ll tackle it again

and he did �tackle it again�--and under the double pressure of curiosity
and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a
shining success. mary gave him a brand-new �barlow� knife worth twelve
and a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system
shook him to his foundations. true, the knife would not cut anything,
but it was a �sure-enough� barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur
in that--though where the western boys ever got the idea that such a
weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing
mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. tom contrived to scarify the
cupboard with it, an

d was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was
called off to dress for sunday-school.

mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;
poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen
and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. but
mary removed the towel and said:

�now ain�t you ashamed, tom. you mustn�t be so bad. water won�t hurt
you.�

tom was a trifle disconcerted. the basin was refilled, and this time he
stood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath
and began. when he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut
and groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of
suds and water was dripping from his face. but when he emerged from
the towel, he was not yet satisfa

ctory, for the clean territory stopped
short at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line
there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
front and backward around his neck. mary took him in hand, and when she
was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of
color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls
wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [he privately
smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his
hair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his
own filled his life with bitterness.] then mary got out a suit of his
clothing that had been used only on sundays durin

 called his �other clothes�--and so by that we know the size of his
wardrobe. the girl �put him to rights� after he had dressed himself;
she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt
collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with
his speckled straw hat. he now looked exceedingly improved and
uncomfortable. he was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there
was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. he
hoped that mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she
coated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought
them out. he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didn�t want to do. but mary said, persuasively:

�please, tom--that�s a good boy.�

so he got into the shoes snarling. mary was soon ready, and the three
children set out for sunday-school--a place that tom hated with his whole
heart; but sid and mary were fond of it.

got his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a passage of scripture
on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. ten
blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red
tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent
gave a very plainly bound bible (worth forty cents in those easy
times) to the pupil. how many of my readers would have the industry and
application to memorize two thousand verses, even for a dore bible? and
yet mary had acquired two bibles in this way--it was the patient work of
two years--and a boy of german parentage had won four or five. he once
recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his
mental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot
from that day forth--a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great
occasions, before company, the superintendent (as tom expressed it)
had always made this boy come out and �spread himself.� only the older

 was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple
of weeks. it is possible that tom�s mental stomach had never really
hungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being
had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.

in due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with
a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
leaves, and commanded attention. when a sunday-school superintendent
makes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as
necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert--though
why, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music
is ever referred to by the sufferer. this superintendent was a slim
creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he
wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears
and whose sharp points curved forwa

on. it is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. it was of a
pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.

the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of
isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary. but now every sound
ceased suddenly, with the subsidence of mr. walters� voice, and the
conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.

a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
more or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer thatcher, accompanied
by a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman
with iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter�s
wife. the lady was leading a child. tom had b

chapter v

about half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,
and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. the
sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. aunt
polly came, and tom and sid and mary sat with her--tom being placed next
the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window
and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. the crowd filed up
the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;
the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other
unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow douglass, fair,
smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
mansion the only palace in the town, and the mos

town, and tell her--�

but sid had snatched his clothes and gone. tom was suffering in reality,
now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had
gathered quite a genuine tone.

sid flew downstairs and said:

�oh, aunt polly, come! tom�s dying!�

�dying!�

�yes�m. don�t wait--come quick!�

�rubbage! i don�t believe it!�

but she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with sid and mary at her heels.
and her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. when she reached the
bedside she gasped out:

�you, tom! tom, what�s the matter with you?�

�oh, auntie, i�m--�

�what�s the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?�

�oh, auntie, my sore toe�s mortified!�

the old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
little, then did both together. this restored her and she said:

�tom, what a turn you did give me. now you shut up

that nonsense and
climb out of this.�

the groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. the boy felt a
little foolish, and he said:

�aunt polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so i never minded my
tooth at all.�

�your tooth, indeed! what�s the matter with your tooth?�

�one of them�s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.�

�there, there, now, don�t begin that groaning again. open your mouth.
well--your tooth _is_ loose, but you�re not going to die about that.
mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.�

tom said:

�oh, please, auntie, don�t pull it out. it don�t hurt any more. i wish
i may never stir if it does. please don�t, auntie. i don�t want to stay
home from school.�

�oh, you don�t, don�t you? so all this row was because you thought you�d
get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? tom, tom, i love you so,
and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your
outrageousness.� by t

, it�s blood, that�s what it is!� you said that over and over.
and you said, �don�t torment me so--i�ll tell!� tell _what_? what is it

everything was swimming before tom. there is no telling what might have
happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of aunt polly�s face
and she came to tom�s relief without knowing it. she said:

�sho! it�s that dreadful murder. i dream about it most every night
myself. sometimes i dream it�s me that done it.�

mary said she had been affected much the same way. sid seemed satisfied.
tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after
that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every
night. he never knew that sid lay nightly watching, and frequently
slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good
while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place
again. tom�s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew

�who?� said huck.

�why, the pirates.�

huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.

�i reckon i ain�t dressed fitten for a pirate,� said he, with a
regretful pathos in his voice; �but i ain�t got none but these.�

but the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,
after they should have begun their adventures. they made him understand
that his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for
wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.

gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
eyelids of the little waifs. the pipe dropped from the fingers of the
red-handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.
the terror of the seas and the black avenger of the spanish main had
more difficulty in getting to sleep. they said their prayers inwardly,
and lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them

his success, for he knew it was the boat�s last trip for the night. at
the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and
tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards
downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.

he flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
aunt�s back fence. he climbed over, approached the �ell,� and looked
in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. there
sat aunt polly, sid, mary, and joe harper�s mother, grouped together,
talking. they were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the
door. tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then
he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing
cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might
squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,
warily.

�what makes the candle blow so?� said aunt polly. tom hurried up. �why,

tear the house down. and god forgive me, i cracked tom�s head with my
thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. but he�s out of all his troubles now.
and the last words i ever heard him say was to reproach--�

but this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely
down. tom was snuffling, now, himself--and more in pity of himself than
anybody else. he could hear mary crying, and putting in a kindly word
for him from time to time. he began to have a nobler opinion of himself
than ever before. still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt�s grief
to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy--and
the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his
nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.

he went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was
conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swi

ys, being good swimmers, would
otherwise have escaped to shore. this was wednesday night. if the bodies
continued missing until sunday, all hope would be given over, and the
funerals would be preached on that morning. tom shuddered.

mrs. harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. then with a
mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other�s
arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. aunt polly was
tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to sid and mary. sid
snuffled a bit and mary went off crying with all her heart.

aunt polly knelt down and prayed for tom so touchingly, so appealingly,
and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,
that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.

he had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making
broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and
turning over. but at last she was still, only moaning a little in her
sleep. no

sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
that lay upon nature. the villagers began to gather, loitering a moment
in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. but there
was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses
as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. none
could remember when the little church had been so full before. there
was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then aunt polly
entered, followed by sid and mary, and they by the harper family, all in
deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose
reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.
there was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled
sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. a moving
hymn was sung, and the text followed: �i am the resurrection and the
life.�

as the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the
graces, the winning ways, and t

 a moment later
the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above
his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! first one and then another pair
of eyes followed the minister�s, and then almost with one impulse the
congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up
the aisle, tom in the lead, joe next, and huck, a ruin of drooping rags,
sneaking sheepishly in the rear! they had been hid in the unused gallery
listening to their own funeral sermon!

aunt polly, mary, and the harpers threw themselves upon their restored
ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while
poor huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what
to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. he wavered, and
started to slink away, but tom seized him and said:

�aunt polly, it ain�t fair. somebody�s got to be glad to see huck.�

�and so they shall. i�m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!� and

that was tom�s great secret--the scheme to return home with his brother
pirates and attend their own funerals. they had paddled over to the
missouri shore on a log, at dusk on saturday, landing five or six miles
below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town
till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys
and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of
invalided benches.

at breakfast, monday morning, aunt polly and mary were very loving to
tom, and very attentive to his wants. there was an unusual amount of
talk. in the course of it aunt polly said:

�well, i don�t say it wasn�t a fine joke, tom, to keep everybody
suffering �most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you
could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. if you could come over
on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a
hint some way that you warn�t dead, but only run off.�

�yes, you could

 have done that, tom,� said mary; �and i believe you
would if you had thought of it.�

�would you, tom?� said aunt polly, her face lighting wistfully. �say,
now, would you, if you�d thought of it?�

�i--well, i don�t know. �twould �a� spoiled everything.�

�tom, i hoped you loved me that much,� said aunt polly, with a grieved
tone that discomforted the boy. �it would have been something if you�d
cared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn�t _do_ it.�

and wish you�d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
little.�

�i�d know it better if you acted more like it.�

�it ain�t much--a cat does that much--but it�s better than nothing. what

�why, wednesday night i dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
bed, and sid was sitting by the woodbox, and mary next to him.�

�well, so we did. so we always do. i�m glad your dreams could take even
that much trouble about us.�

�and i dreamt that joe harper�s mother was here.�

�why, she was here! did you dream any more?�

judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the

irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and

and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. she tried to go away, but her
feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. she said to
a girl almost at tom�s elbow--with sham vivacity:

the exercises began. a very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,
�you�d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,�
 etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic
gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a
trifle out of order. but he got through safely, though cruelly scared,
and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and
retired.

rollicking company were gathered at judge thatcher�s, and everything was
ready for a start. it was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
picnics with their presence. the children were considered safe enough
under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young
gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. the old steam ferry-boat was
chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main
street laden with provision-baskets. sid was sick and had to miss
the fun; mary remained at home to entertain him. the last thing mrs.

and led nowhere. it was said that one might wander days and nights
together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never
find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and
still down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth under
labyrinth, and no end to any of them. no man �knew� the cave. that was
an impossible thing. most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it
was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. tom sawyer
knew as much of the cave as any one.

the procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of
a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise
at points where the corridors joined again. parties were able to elude

as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. they
were covered with clay and candle-grease. aunt polly blushed crimson
with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at tom. nobody suffered

�shucks! what do you want to slope for?�

�well, i ain�t used to that kind of a crowd. i can�t stand it. i ain�t

got your sunday clothes ready, and everybody�s been fretting about you.
say--ain�t this grease and clay, on your clothes?�

�now, mr. siddy, you jist �tend to your own business. what�s all this
blowout about, anyway?�

�it�s one of the widow�s parties that she�s always having. this time
it�s for the welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they
