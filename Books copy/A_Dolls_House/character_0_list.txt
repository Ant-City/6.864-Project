Nora - 
                	The
protagonist of the play and the wife of Torvald Helmer. Nora initially
seems like a playful, naive child who lacks knowledge of the world
outside her home. She does have some worldly experience, however,
and the small acts of rebellion in which she engages indicate that
she is not as innocent or happy as she appears. She comes to see
her position in her marriage with increasing clarity and finds the
strength to free herself from her oppressive situation.
