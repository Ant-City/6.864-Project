dmiration. he 
had had time to see her eyes; they seemed weary and a little contemptuous, but they left him 
with a sense of cold cruelty.

he heard her walking up the stairs, and the feeling vanished, but the admiration remained. he 
approached the reception clerk eagerly.

"who was that?" he asked.

the clerk shrugged:

"that's the boss's little girl."

"why, the lucky stiff!" said keating. "he's been holding out on me."

"you misunderstood me," the clerk said coldly. "it's his daughter. it's dominique francon."

"oh," said keating. "oh, lord!"

"yeah?" the girl looked at him sarcastically. "have you read this morning's banner?"

"no. why?"

"read it."

her switchboard buzzed and she turned away from him.

he sent a boy for a copy of the banner, and turned anxiously to the column, "your house," by 
dominique francon. he had heard that she'd been quite successful lately with descriptions of 
the homes of prominent new yorkers. her field was confined to home decoration, but she 
ventured occasionally i

"why," said keating, "we were..."

"oh, there's eugene pettingill. my great favorite. i must say hello to eugene."

and she was up, moving across the room, her body leaning back as she walked, moving 
toward the most unattractive septuagenarian present.

keating did not know whether he had been made to join the brotherhood of gordon l. 
prescott, or whether it had been only an accident.

he returned to the ballroom reluctantly. he forced himself to join groups of guests and to talk. 
he watched dominique francon as she moved through the crowd, as she stopped in 
conversation with others. she never glanced at him again. he could not decide whether he 
had succeeded with her or failed miserably.

he managed to be at the door when she was leaving.

she stopped and smiled at him enchantingly.

"no," she said, before he could utter a word, "you can't take me home. i have a car waiting. 
thank you just the same."

she was gone and he stood at the door, helpless and thinking furiously that he believed he

later, at the start of the slum campaign, gail wynand had said to alvah scarret; "go ahead. 
squeeze all you can out of the thing," and had departed on his yacht for a world cruise, 
accompanied by an enchanting aviatrix of twenty-four to whom he had made a present of his 
transcontinental plane.

alvah scarret went ahead. among many other steps of his campaign he assigned dominique 
francon to investigate the condition of homes in the slums and to gather human material. 
dominique francon had just returned from a summer in biarritz; she always took a whole 
summer's vacation and alvah scarret granted it, because she was one of his favorite 
employees, because he was baffled by her and because he knew that she could quit her job 
whenever she pleased.

dominique francon went to live for two weeks in the hall bedroom of an east-side tenement. 
the room had a skylight, but no windows; there were five flights of stairs to climb and no 
running water. she cooked her own meals in the

himself: well, here it is again. he waited to see how long it would last. it gave him a strange, 
hard pleasure to watch his fight against it, and he could forget that it was his own suffering; he 
could smile in contempt, not realizing that he smiled at his own agony. such moments were 
rare. but when they came, he felt as he did in the quarry: that he had to drill through granite, 
that he had to drive a wedge and blast the thing within him which persisted in calling to his 
pity.
#

dominique francon lived alone, that summer, in the great colonial mansion of her father's 
estate, three miles beyond the quarry town. she received no visitors. an old caretaker and his 
wife were the only human beings she saw, not too often and merely of necessity; they lived 
some distance from the mansion, near the stables; the caretaker attended to the grounds and 
the horses; his wife attended to the house and cooked dominique's meals.

the meals were served with the gracious severity the old woman had lear

been shown the gate by the unsatisfiable mr. enright. top-notchers, all of them."

roark felt the wrench he had tried so often to fight, not to let it hurt him too much: the wrench 
of helplessness before the vision of what he could do, what should have been possible and 
was closed to him. then, without reason, he thought of dominique francon. she had no 
relation to the things in his mind; he was shocked only to know that she could remain present 
even among these things.

a week passed. then, one evening, he found a letter waiting for him at home. it had been 
forwarded from his former office to his last new york address, from there to mike, from mike 
to connecticut. the engraved address of an oil company on the envelope meant nothing to 
him. he opened the letter. he read:

she read it and smiled. she thought, if they knew...those people...that old life and that awed 
reverence before her person...i've been raped...i've been raped by some redheaded hoodlum 
from a stone quarry....i, dominique francon....through the fierce sense of humiliation, the 

words gave her the same kind of pleasure she had felt in his arms.

she thought of it when she walked through the countryside, when she passed people on the 
road and the people bowed to her, the chatelaine of the town. she wanted to scream it to the 
hearing of all.

she was not conscious of the days that passed. she felt content in a strange detachment, 
alone with the words she kept repeating to herself. then, one morning, standing on the la

was gratifying to discover that he was much more than this; that his daily activity carried a 
nobler significance. it was pleasant and it was drugging. he knew that all the others in the 
room felt it also.

"...and when our system of society collapses, the craft of builders will not be swept under, it 
will be swept up to greater prominence and greater recognition..."

the doorbell rang. then toohey's valet appeared for an instant, holding the door of the living 

room open to admit dominique francon.

by the manner in which toohey stopped, on a half-uttered word, keating knew that dominique 
had not been invited or expected. she smiled at toohey, shook her head and moved one 
hand in a gesture telling him to continue. he managed a faint bow in her direction, barely more
than a movement of his eyebrows, and went on with his speech. it was a pleasant greeting 
and its informality included the guest in the intimate brotherhood of the occasion, but it 
seemed to keating that it had come just o

she?"

keating winced. he wondered when and how toohey had had the time to notice that.

"oh, well," said toohey, "the exception proves the rule. regrettable, however. i've always had 
the absurd idea that it would take a most unusual man to attract dominique francon. so of 
course i thought of you. just an idle thought. still, you know, the man who'll get her will have 
something you won't be able to match. he'll beat you there."

"no one's got her," snapped keating.

"no, undoubtedly not. not yet. that's rather astonishing. oh, i suppose it will take an 
extraordinary kind of man."

"look here, what in hell are you doing? you don't like dominique francon. do you?"

"i never said i did."

a little later keating heard toohey saying solemnly in the midst of

on his tall, thin figure, but somehow it seemed that he did not belong in them; the orange hair 
looked preposterous with formal dress; besides, she did not like his face; that face suited a 
work gang or an army, it had no place in her drawing room. she said:

"we've all been so interested in your work. your first building?"

"my fifth."

"oh, indeed? of course. how interesting."

she clasped her hands, and turned to greet a new arrival. heller said:

"whom do you want to meet first?...there's dominique francon looking at us. come on."

roark turned; he saw dominique standing alone across the room. there was no expression 
on her face, not even an effort to avoid expression; it was strange to see a human face 
presenting a bone structure and an arrangement of muscles, but no meaning, a face as a 
simple anatomical feature, like a shoulder or an arm, not a mirror of sensate perception any 
longer. she looked at them as they approached. her feet stood posed oddly, two small 
triangles pointed straight a

this appeared in the column "your house" by dominique francon, a week after the party at 
the home of kiki holcombe.

on the morning of its appearance ellsworth toohey walked into dominique's office. he held a 

copy of the banner, with the page bearing her column turned toward her. he stood silently, 
rocking a little on his small feet. it seemed as if the expression of his eyes had to be heard, 
not seen: it was a visual roar of laughter. his lips were folded primly, innocently.

"well?" she asked.

"where did you meet roark before that party?"

stifications which dominique had taught him a few hours 
ago. but roark said nothing; he had merely inclined his head when he heard the decision. mr. 
sutton wanted desperately to utter the justifications, but it seemed pointless to try to convince 
a man who seemed convinced. still, mr. sutton loved people and did not want to hurt anyone.

"as a matter of fact, mr. roark, i'm not alone in this decision. as a matter of fact, i did want 
you, i had decided on you, honestly i had, but it was miss dominique francon, whose 
judgment i value most highly, who convinced me that you were not the right choice for this 
commission--and she was fair enough to allow me to tell you that she did."

he saw roark looking at him suddenly. then he saw the hollows of roark's cheeks twisted, 
as if drawn in deeper, and his mouth open: he was laughing, without sound but for one sharp 
intake of breath.

"what on earth are you laughing at, mr. roark?"

"so miss francon wanted you to tell me this?"

"she didn't want me to, w

the maid came in with the tray. toohey took a glass and held it delicately, inhaling, while the 
maid went out.

"will you tell me why the secret service department--i won't ask who--and why the detailed 
reports on ray activities?" dominique said indifferently.

"you can ask who. anyone and everyone. don't you suppose people are talking about miss

objective, just art, free art." she heard the sound of his soft chuckle, but he did not turn to look 
at her, only his fingers closed over her wrist and he pushed her hand farther down under his 
shirt, pressing it hard against his skin. then she pulled his head back, and she bent down to 
cover his mouth with hers.

she came in and found a copy of the banner spread out on his table, open at the page 
bearing "your house" by dominique francon. her column contained the line: "howard roark 
is the marquis de sade of architecture. he's in love with his buildings--and look at them." she 
knew that he disliked the banner, that he put it there only for her sake, that he watched her 
noticing it, with the half-smile she dreaded on his face. she was angry; she wanted him to 
read everything she wrote, yet she would have preferred to think that it hurt him enough to 
make him avoid it. later, lying across the bed, with his mouth on her breas

her face buried against his knees, her arm hanging down over the side of the bed, not moving, 
as if nothing in her were alive but the skin between her shoulder blades under his hand.

in the drawing rooms she visited, in the restaurants, in the offices of the a.g.a. people talked 
about the dislike of miss dominique francon of the banner for howard roark, that 
architectural freak of roger enright's. it gave him a sort of scandalous fame. it was said: 
"roark? you know, the guy dominique francon can't stand the guts of."

"the francon girl knows her architecture all right, and if she says he's no good, he must be 
worse than i thought he was."

"god, but these two must hate each other! though i understand they haven't even met." she 
liked to hear these things. it pleased her when athelstan beasely wrote in his co

roark."

austen heller, who had been her friend, spoke to her about it. he was angrier than she had 
ever seen him; his face lost all the charm of his usual sarcastic poise.

"what in hell do you think you're doing, dominique?" he snapped. "this is the greatest 
exhibition of journalistic hooliganism i've ever seen swilled out in public print. why don't you 
leave that sort of thing to ellsworth toohey?"

"ellsworth is good, isn't he?" she said.

went on smiling blandly--her hand resting casually on the black sleeve of his dinner jacket, her 
thigh against his as she stood beside him, her pose possessive and intimate, made flagrantly 
intimate by her air of not noticing it, while she told an admiring circle what she thought of the 
cosmo-slotnick building. he heard envious comments from all his friends. he was, he 
thought bitterly, the only man in new york city who did not think that dominique francon was 
in love with him.

but he knew the dangerous instability of her whims, and this was too valuable a whim to 
disturb. he stayed away from her and sent her flowers; he rode along and tried not to think of 
it; the little edge remained--a thin edge of uneasiness.

one day, he met her by chance in a restaurant. he saw her lunching alone and grasped the 
opportunity. he walked straight to her table, determined to act like an old friend who 
remembered nothing but her incredible benevolence. aft

of the woman who would have made such a perfect picture by your side."

"oh, don't pay attention to me. it's only an esthetic fancy. life is never as perfect as that. 
people have too much to envy you for. you couldn't add that to your other achievements."

keating sat up straight and toohey saw wariness in his eyes, rebellion, actual hostility. toohey 
held his glance calmly. it was keating who gave in; he slumped again and he said, pleading:

"oh, god, ellsworth, i don't love her."

"i never thought you did. but i do keep forgetting the exaggerated importance which the 
average man attaches to love--sexual love."

john erik snyte testified modestly and unobtrusively that he had employed roark in his office, 
that roark had been an unreliable, disloyal and unscrupulous employee, and that roark had 
started his career by stealing a client from him.

on the fourth day of the trial the plaintiff's attorney called his last witness.

"miss dominique francon," he announced solemnly.

mallory gasped, but no one heard it; mike's hand clamped down on his wrist and made him 
keep still.

the attorney had reserved dominique for his climax, partly because he expected a great deal 
from her, and partly because he was worried; she was the only unrehearsed witness; she had 
refused to be coached. she had never mentioned the stoddard temple in her column; but he 
had looked up her earlier writings on roark; and ellsworth toohey had advised him to call her.

dominique stood for a moment on the elevation of the witness stand, looking slowly over the 
crowd. her beauty was startling but too impersonal, as if it did not belong to her; it seemed 
present in the room as a separate entity. people thought of a vision that had not quite 
appeared, of a victim on a scaffold, of a person standing at night at the rail of an ocean liner.

"what is your name?"

"dominique francon."

"and your occupation, miss francon?"

"newspaper woman."

"you are the author of the brilliant column 'your house' appearing in the new york banner!"

"i am the author of 'your house.'"

"your father is guy francon, the eminent architect?"

"yes. my father was asked to come here to testify. he refused. he said he did not care for a 
building such as the stoddard temple, but he did not think that we were behaving like 
gentlemen."

"well, now, miss francon, shall we confine our answers to our

"oh, go on, go on, go on, don't be silly. now don't get ridiculous. you know better than that.

"you'll have to choose, alvah."

scarret knew that he would get hell from gail wynand if he printed the thing, and might get 
hell if he lost dominique francon whose column was popular. wynand had not returned from 
his cruise. scarret cabled him in bali, explaining the situation.

within a few hours scarret received an answer. it was in wynand's private code. translated it 
read fire the bitch. g.w.

scarret stared at the cable, crushed. it was an order that allowed no alternative, even if 
dominique surrendered. he hoped she would resign. he could not face the thought of having 
to fire her.

t. then he heard the sound of catherine's sobs. he walked to her 
room and entered without knocking. he asked:

"what's the matter, my dear? has peter done something to hurt you?"

she half lifted herself on the bed, she looked at him, throwing her hair back off her face, 
sobbing exultantly. she said without thinking the first thing she felt like saying. she said 

something which she did not understand, but he did: "i'm not afraid of you, uncle ellsworth!"

"who?" gasped keating.

"miss dominique francon," the maid repeated.

"you're drunk, you damn fool!"

"mr. keating!..."

he was on his feet, he shoved her out of the way, he flew into the living room, and saw 
dominique francon standing there, in his apartment.

"hello, peter."

"dominique!...dominique, how come?" in his anger, apprehension, curiosity and flattered 
pleasure, his first conscious thought was gratitude to god that his mother was not at home.

"i phoned your office. they said you had gone home."

traffic signs, low by the side of the road, springing suddenly into life as they approached, 
spelling out: "left turn,"

"crossing ahead," in dots of light that seemed conscious, malevolent, winking.

they drove silently, but there was no bond in their silence now; they were not walking together 
toward disaster; the disaster had come; their courage did not matter any longer.

he felt disturbed and uncertain as he always felt in the presence of dominique francon.

he half turned to look at her. she kept her eyes on the road. her profile in the cold wind was 
serene and remote and lovely in a way that was hard to bear. he looked at her gloved hands 
resting firmly, one on each side of the wheel. he looked down at her slender foot on the 
accelerator, then his eyes rose up the line of her leg. his glance remained on the narrow 
triangle of her tight gray skirt. he realized suddenly that he had a right to think what he was 
thinking.

then he kissed her and let her go.

15.

at nine o'clock that morning peter keating was pacing the floor of his room, his door 
locked. he forgot that it was nine o'clock and that catherine was waiting for him. he had made 
himself forget her and everything she implied.

the door of his room was locked to protect him from his mother. last night, seeing his furious 
restlessness, she had forced him to tell her the truth. he had snapped that he was married to 
dominique francon, and he had added some sort of explanation about dominique going out 
of town to announce the marriage to some old relative. his mother had been so busy with 
gasps of delight and questions, that he had been able to 'answer nothing and to hide his 
panic; he was not certain that he had a wife and that she would come back to him in the 
morning.

he had forbidden his mother to announce the news, but she had made a few telephone calls 
last night, and she was making a few more this morning, and n

"i think i knew that you'd come here some day and i think i wanted to be here when you came. 
i've kept inventing excuses for myself to hang about this place." there was no gloating in the 
voice; it sounded drained and simple.

"well?"

"you shouldn't mind speaking to me. you see, i understand your work. what i do about it is 
another matter."

"you are free to do what you wish about it."

"i understand your work better than any living person--with the possible exception of

"i knew you understood."

"then you won't mind talking to me."

"about what?"

in the darkness it sounded almost as if toohey had sighed. after a while he pointed to the 
building and asked:

"do you understand this?"

roark did not answer.

toohey went on softly: "what does it look like to you? li

send him; he had expected something less tangible--a small envelope containing a 
hint at some sort of blackmail; so many people had tried to blackmail him so unsuccessfully; 
he did think toohey would have more sense than that.

by the time he finished his drink, he had found no plausible explanation for the crate. it 
annoyed him, like a stubborn crossword puzzle. he had a kit of tools somewhere in a drawer 
of his desk. he found it and broke the crate open.

it was steven mallory's statue of dominique francon. gail wynand walked to his desk and put 
down the pliers he held as if they were of fragile crystal. then he turned and looked at the 
statue again. he stood looking at it for an hour. then he went to the telephone and dialed 
toohey's number. "hello?" said toohey's voice, its hoarse impatience confessing that he had 
been awakened out of sound sleep. "all right. come over," said wynand and hung up. toohey

say lightly: "my wife," and to watch the stupid, uncontrolled look of envy in their eyes. once at

but alvah did very well. incidentally, how did you know that i was away and why has the fact of 
my absence remained in your memory?"

"it was the story that cost me my job with you."

"your job? with me?"

"didn't you know that my name was dominique francon?"

under the trim jacket his shoulders made a sagging movement forward; it was surprise--and 
helplessness. he stared at her, quite simply. after a while, he said: "no."

she smiled indifferently. she said: "it appears that toohey wanted to make it as difficult for 
both of us as he could."

"to hell with toohey. this has to be understood. it doesn't make sense. you're dominique

asked: "you said it just to trap me into that kind of a statement?"

"yes, i think so," she answered placidly. "dominique francon..." he repeated, not addressing 
her. "i used to like your stuff. i almost wish you were here to ask for your old job."

"i'm here to discuss stoneridge."

"ah, yes, of course." he settled back, to enjoy a long speech of persuasion. he thought it 
would be interesting to hear what arguments she'd choose and how she'd act in the role of

shock. but i understand how you feel. only you mustn't take it too seriously. it doesn't 
matter." he spoke automatically. his mind was far away. keating did not notice that. he heard 
the words. they were the spring in the desert. "it doesn't matter. you're only human. that's all 
you want to be. who's any better? who has the right to cast the first stone? we're all human. 
it doesn't matter."

"my god!" said alvah scarret. "he can't! not dominique francon!"

"he will," said toohey. "as soon as she returns."

scarret had been surprised that toohey should invite him to lunch, but the news he heard 
wiped out the surprise in a greater and more painful one.

"i'm fond of dominique," said scarret, pushing his plate aside, his appetite gone. "i've always 
been very fond of her. but to have her as mrs. gail wynand!"

"these, exactly, are my own sentiments," said toohey.

"i've always advised him to marry. it helps. lends an air. an insurance of respect

her will help--you know, gingham dresses and aprons and her hair done up in a more 
conventional way."

"shut up, alvah, before i slap your face," said wynand without raising his voice.

"yes, gail."

scarret made a move to get up.

"sit still. i haven't finished."

scarret waited obediently.

"tomorrow morning," said wynand, "you will send a memo to every one of our papers. you 
will tell them to look through their files and find any pictures of dominique francon they might 
have in connection with her old column. you will tell them to destroy the pictures. you will tell 
them that henceforward any mention of her name or the use of her picture in any of my papers
will cost the job of the entire editorial staff responsible. when the proper time comes, you will 
have an announcement of my marriage appear in all our papers. that cannot be avoided. the 
briefest announcement you can compose. no commentaries. no stories. no pictures. pass

house of my own. now i'm not afraid of a visible shape for my life. if you want it said directly, 
as you did, now i'm happy."

"what kind of house?"

"in the country. i've purchased the site. an estate in connecticut, five hundred acres. what 
kind of a house? you'll decide that."

"did mrs. wynand choose me for the job?"

"no. mrs. wynand knows nothing about this. it was i who wanted to move out of the city, and 
she agreed. i did ask her to select the architect--my wife is the former dominique francon; 
she was once a writer on architecture. but she preferred to leave the choice to me. you want 
to know why i picked you? i took a long time to decide. i felt rather lost, at first. i had never 

heard of you. i didn't know any architects at all. i mean this literally--and i'm not forgetting the 
years i've spent in real estate, the things i've built and the imbeciles who built them for me.

 sight a second longer than necessary. but he stopped for a long time 
to look at the photographs of the stoddard temple. he stopped longer to look at one of 
roark's pictures, the picture of exaltation captioned "are you happy, mr. superman?" he tore 
it from the story it illustrated, and slipped it into his desk drawer. then he continued reading.

the trial--the testimony of ellsworth m. toohey--of peter keating--of ralston holcombe--of 
gordon l. prescott--no quotations from the testimony of dominique francon, only a brief 
report. "the defense rests." a few mentions in "one small voice"--then a gap--the next 
clipping dated three years later--monadnock valley.

it was late when he finished reading. his secretaries had left. he felt the sense of empty 
rooms and halls around him. but he heard the sound of presses: a low, rumbling vibration that 
went through every room. he had always liked that--the sound of the building's heart, beating. 
he listened. they were running off tomorrow's banner. he sat

ynand--a tragic, self-sacrificing love was his justification. it was an inverse ratio in scarret's 
calculations: every filthy adjective thrown at dominique created sympathy for wynand in the 
reader's mind; this fed scarret's smear talent. it worked. the public responded, the banner's 
old feminine readers in particular. it helped in the slow, painful work of the paper's 
reconstruction.

letters began to arrive, generous in their condolences, unrestrained in the indecency of their 
comment on dominique francon. "like the old days, gail," said scarret happily, "just like the 
old days!" he piled all the letters on wynand's desk.

wynand sat alone in his office with the letters. scarret could not suspect that this was the 
worst of the suffering gail wynand was to know. he made himself read every letter. 
dominique, whom he had tried to save from the banner...

when they met in the building, scarret looked at him expectantly, with an entreating, tentative 
half-smile, an eager pupil waiting for the tea
