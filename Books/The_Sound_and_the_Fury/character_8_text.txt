mother came out, pulling her veil down. she had some flowers.  
"where's roskus." she said.  
"roskus cant lift his arms, today." dilsey said. "t.p. can drive all right."  
"i'm afraid to." mother said. "it seems to me you all could furnish me with 
a driver for the carriage once a week. it's little enough i ask, lord knows."  
"you know just as well as me that roskus got the rheumatism too bad to do

"i'm not going slow." caddy said. we went up the hill, but quentin didn't 
come. he was down at the branch when we got to where we could smell the 
pigs. they were grunting and snuffing in the trough in the comer. jason 
came behind us, with his hands in his pockets. roskus was milking the cow 
in the barn door.

the cows came jumping out of the barn.  
"go on." t.p. said. "holler again. i going to holler myself. whooey." 
quentin kicked t.p. again. he kicked t.p. into the trough where the pigs 
ate and t.p. lay there. "hot dog." t.p. said. "didn't he get me then. you see

"i expect we'd better go down to versh's house, so we'll be quiet." caddy 
said. versh put me down and caddy took my hand and we went down the 

brick walk.  
"come on." caddy said. "that frog's gone. he's hopped way over to the 
garden, by now. maybe we'll see another one." roskus came with the milk 
buckets. he went on. quentin wasn't coming with us. he was sitting on the 
kitchen steps. we went down to versh's house. i liked to smell versh's 
house. [...]

"hush." t.p. said. "come on. les go down to the barn." roskus was milking 
at the barn. he was milking with one hand, and groaning. some birds sat 
on the barn door and watched him. one of them came down and ate with 
the cows. i watched roskus milk while t.p. was feeding queenie and 
prince. the calf was in the pig pen. it nuzzled at the wire, bawling.  
"t.p." roskus said. t.p. said sir, in the barn. fancy held her head over the 
door, because t.p. hadn't fed her yet. "git done there." roskus said. "you 
got to do this milking. i cant use my right hand no more."  
t.p. came and milked.

ve wasted a lot of time and trouble before i learned that the best way 
to take all people, black or white, is to take them for what they think they 
are, then leave them alone. that was when i realisedthat a digger is not a 
person so much as a form of behavior; a sort of obverse reflection of the 
white people he lives among. but i thought at first that i ought to miss 
having a lot of them around me because i thought that northerners 
thought i did, but i didn't know that i really had missed roskus and dilsey 
and them until that morning in virginia. the train was stopped when i 
waked and i raised the shade and looked out. the car was blocking a road 
crossing, where two white fences came down a hill and then sprayed 
outward and downward like part of the skeleton of a horn, and there was a 

nigger on a mule in the middle of the stiff ruts, waiting for the train to 
move. how long he had been there i didn't know, but he sat straddle of the 
mule, his head wrapped in a piece of blanket,

     "yes. and it's written inside, not good until tomorrow."   
     "h'm," he said. he looked at the envelope, his mouth pursed.

     "yes. a present i'm making you."   
     he was looking at me now, the envelope white in his black hand, in the 
sun. his eyes were soft and irisless and brown, and suddenly i saw roskus 
watching me from behind all his whitefolks' claptrap of uniforms and 
politics and harvard manner, diffident, secret, inarticulate and sad. "you 
aint playing a joke on the old nigger, is you?"   
     "you know i'm not. did any southerner ever play a joke on you?"   
     "you're right. they're fine folks. but you cant live with them."
