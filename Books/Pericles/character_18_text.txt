marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
into an honest house, our story says.
she sings like one immortal, and she dances
as goddess-like to her admired lays;
deep clerks she dumbs; and with her neeld composes
nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
that even her art sistrs the natural roses;
her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:
that pupils lacks she none of noble race,
who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
she gives the cursed bawd. here we her place;
and to her father turn our thoughts again,
where we left him, on the sea. we there him lost;
whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived
here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
suppose him now at anchor. the city strived
god neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence
lysimachus our tyrian ship espies,
his banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
and to him in his barge with fervour hies.
