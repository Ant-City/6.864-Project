[CHARACTER] - 
            christopher's primary teacher at school. an even-handed mentor, she works
                to expand christopher's horizons socially as well as academically. as a result, she
                is one of the few people whom christopher trusts, and in the limited moments when
                the reader sees her, she mirrors the reader as an observer and commentator on
                christopher's life.
