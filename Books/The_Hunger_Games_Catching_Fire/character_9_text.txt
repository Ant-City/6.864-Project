h about how she  just can't stop crying when 
she thinks of how much the people in the capitol must be suffering because they will lose us. 
gloss recalls the kindness shown here to him and his sister. beetee questions the legality of 
the  quell  in  his  nervous,  twitchy  way,  wondering  if  it's  been  fully  examined  by  experts  of 
late. finnick recites a poem he wrote to his one true love in the capitol, and about a hundred 
people faint because they're sure he means them. by the time johanna mason gets up, she's 
asking if something can't be done about the situation. surely the creators of the quarter quell 
never anticipated such love forming between the victors and the capitol. no one could be so 

cruel as to sever such a deep bond. seeder quietly ruminates about how, back in district 11, 
everyone  assumes  president  snow  is  all-powerful.  so  if  he's  all-powerful,  why  doesn't  he 
change  the  quell?  and  chaff,  who  comes  right  on  her  heels,  insists  the  president

ed collapses on the beach. the dragger stamps the ground in frustration and, in an 
apparent fit of temper, turns and shoves the circling, deranged one over. 

finnick's face lights up. “johanna!” he calls, and runs for the red things. 

“finnick!” i hear johanna's voice reply. 

i exchange a look with peeta. “what now?” i ask. 

“we can't really leave finnick,” he says. 

“guess  not.  come  on,  then,”  i  say  grouchily,  because  even  if  i'd  had  a  list  of  allies, 
johanna mason would definitely not have been on it. the two of us tromp down the beach to 
where finnick and johanna are just meeting up. as we move in closer, i see her companions, 
and confusion sets in. that's beetee on the ground on his back and wiress who's regained her 
feet to continue making loops. “she's got wiress and beetee.” 

“nuts and volts?” says peeta, equally puzzled. “i've got to hear how this happened.” 

when  we  reach  them,  johanna's  gesturing  toward  the  jungle  and  t

reaches  for  me, i think to strike 
me,  but  he  does  something  worse.  with  his  thumb  and  his  forefinger,  he  slides  my  eyelids 
shut, sentencing me to the vulnerability of darkness. they can do anything to me now and i 
will not even see it coming. 

my  heart  pounds  so  hard  the  blood  begins  to  stream  from  beneath  my  soaked  moss 
bandage. my thoughts grow foggy. possibly i can bleed to death before they can revive  me 
after all. in  my  mind, i whisper a thank-you to johanna mason  for the excellent wound she 
inflicted as i black out. 

when i swim back into semi consciousness, i can feel i'm lying on a padded table. there's 
the pinching sensation of tubes in my left arm. they are trying to keep me alive because, if i 
slide quietly, privately into death, it will be a victory. i'm still largely unable to move, open 
my eyelids, raise my head. but my right arm has regained a little motion. it flops across my
