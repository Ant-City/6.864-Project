[CHARACTER] 

[CHARACTER] is a foil to edward rochester. whereas
rochester is passionate, st. john is austere and ambitious. jane
often describes rochester's eyes as flashing and flaming, whereas
she constantly associates st. john with rock, ice, and snow. marriage
with rochester represents the abandonment of principle for the consummation of
passion, but marriage to st. john would mean sacrificing passion for
principle. when he invites her to come to india with him as a missionary,
st. john offers jane the chance to make a more meaningful contribution
to society than she would as a housewife. at the same time, life
with st. john would mean life without true love, in which jane's
need for spiritual solace would be filled only by retreat into the
recesses of her own soul. independence would be accompanied by loneliness,
and joining st. john would require jane to neglect her own legitimate
needs for love and emotional support. her consideration of st. john's
proposal leads jane to understand that, paradoxically, a large part
of one's personal freedom is found in a relationship of mutual emotional
dependence.
