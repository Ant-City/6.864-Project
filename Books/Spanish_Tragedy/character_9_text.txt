oebus waning to the western deep,
    our trumpeters were charg'd to sound retreat.

  king.  thanks, good lord general, for these good news!
    and, for some argument of more to come,
    take this and wear it for thy sovereign's sake.

                  give him his chain.

    but tell me now:  hast thou confirm'd a peace?

  gen.  no peace, my liege, but peace conditional,
    that, if with homage tribute be well paid,
    the fury of your forces will be stay'd.
    and to this peace their viceroy hath subscrib'd,

                  give the king a paper.

    and made a solemn vow that during life
    his tribute shall be truly paid to spain.

  king.  these words, these deeds become thy person well.
    but now, knight-marshall, frolic with thy king,
    for 'tis thy son that wins this battle's prize.

  hiero.  long may he live to serve my sovereign liege!
    and soon decay unless he serve my liege!

                  a trumpet afar off.

  king.  nor thou nor he shall die without re

    to him we yield the armour of the prince.
    how likes don balthazar of this device?

  balt.  right well, my liege, if this proviso were:
    that don horatio bear us company,
    whom i admire and love for chivalry.

  king.  horatio, leave him not that loves thee so.
    now let us hence, to see our soldiers paid,
    and feast our prisoner as our friendly guest.

                  exeunt.

                [portugal:  the viceroy's palace.]

                enter viceroy, alexandro, villuppo.

  vice.  is our ambassador dispatch'd for spain?

  alex.  two days, my liege, are past since his depart.

  vice.  and tribute payment gone along with him?

  alex.  aye, my good lord.

  vice.  then rest we here a-while in our unrest;
    and feed our sorrows with inward sighs,
    for deepest cares break never into tears.
    but wherefore sit i in a regal throne?
    this better fits a wretch's endless moan.

    in some delightful sports and revelling.

  hor.  the king, my lords, is coming hither straight
    to feast the portingal ambassador;
    things were in readiness before i came.

  bal.  then here it fits us to attend the king,
    to welcome hither our ambassador,
    and learn my father and my country's health.

                enter the banquet, trumpets, the king,
                and ambassador.

  king.  see, lord ambassador, how spain entreats
    their prisoner balthazar, thy viceroy's son:
    we pleasure more in kindness than in wars.

  ambass.  sad is our king, and portingal laments,
    supposing that don balthazar is slain.

  bal. [aside]  so am i, slain by beauty's tyranny!--
    you see, my lord, how balthazar is slain:
    i frolic with the duke of castille's son,
    wrapp'd every hour in pleasures of the court,
    and grac'd with favours of his majesty.

  king.  put off your greetings till our feast be done;
    now come and sit with us, and taste our cheer.

    that portingal may deign to bear our yoke,
    when it by little england hath been yok'd.
    but now, hieronimo, what were the last?

  hiero.  the third and last, not least in our account,

                doing as before.

    was, as the rest, a valiant englishman,
    brave john of gaunt, the duke of lancaster,
    as by his scutcheon plainly may appear:
    he with a puissant army came to spain
    and took our king of castille prisoner.

  ambass.  this is an argument for our viceroy
    that spain may not insult for her success,
    since english warriors likewise conquer'd spain
    and made them bow their knees to albion.

  king.  hieronimo, i drink to thee for this device,
    which hath pleas'd both the ambassador and me:
    pledge me, hieronimo, if thou love the king!

                takes the cup of horatio.

    my lord, i fear we sit but over-long,
    unless our dainties were more delicate,--
    but welcome are you to the best we have.
    now let us in, that

    and they abuse fair bel-imperia,
    on whom i doted more then all the world,
    because she lov'd me more then all the world.

  revenge.  thou talk'st of harvest, when the corn is green;
    the end is crown of every work well done;
    the sickle comes not till the corn be ripe.
    be still, and, ere i lead thee from this place,
    i'll show thee balthazar in heavy case.

[act iii.  scene 1.]

                [the portuguese court.]

                enter viceroy of portingal, nobles, alexandro, villuppo.

  viceroy.  infortunate condition of kings,
    seated amidst so many helpless doubts!
    first, we are plac'd upon extremest height,
    and oft supplanted with exceeding hate,
    but ever subject to the wheel of chance;
    and at our highest never joy we so
    as we doubt and dread our overthrow.
    so striveth not the waves with sundry winds
    as fortune toileth in the affairs of kings,
    that would be fear'd, yet fear to be belov'd,

    or wherein is't that i offended thee?

  lor.  advise you better, bel-imperia;
    for i have done you no disparagement,--
    unless, by more discretion then deserv'd,
    i sought to save your honour and mine own.

  bel.  mine honour?  why, lorenzo, wherein is't
    that i neglect my reputation so
    as you, or any, need to rescue it?

  lor.  his highness and my father were resolv'd
    to come confer with old hieronimo
    concerning certain matters of estate
    that by the viceroy was determined.

  bel.  and wherein was mine honour touch'd in that?

  bal.  have patience, bel-imperia; hear the rest.

  lor.  me, next in sight, as messenger they sent
    to give him notice that they were so nigh:
    now, when i came, consorted with the prince,
    and unexpected in an arbor there
    found bel-imperia with horatio--

  bel.   how then?

  lor.  why, then, rememb'ring that old disgrace
    which you for don andrea had endur'd,
    and now were likely longer to sustain

    this way i'll take; and this way comes the king,

                he takes them up again.

    and here i'll have a fling at him, that's flat!
    and, balthazar, i'll be with thee to bring;
    and thee, lorenzo!  here's the king; nay, stay!
    and here,--aye, here,--there goes the hare away!

                enter king, ambassador, castille, and
                lorenzo.

  king.  now show, ambassador, what our viceroy saith:
    hath he receiv'd the articles we sent?

  hiero.  justice!  o, justice to hieronimo!

  lor.  back! see'st thou not the king is busy?

  hiero.  o!  is he so?

  king.  who is he that interrupts our business?

  hiero.  not i!  [aside] hieronimo, beware!  go by, go
    by!

  ambass.  renown'd king, he hath receiv'd and read
    thy kingly proffers and thy promis'd league,
    and, as a man extremely over-joy'd
    to hear his son so princely entertain'd,
    whose death he had so so

    then myrrh or incense to the offended heav'ns.
    in person, therefore, will be come himself
    to see the marriage rites solemnized
    and in the presence of the court of spain
    to knit a sure inextricable band
    of kingly love and everlasting league
    betwixt the crowns of spain and portingal.
    there will he give his crown to balthazar,
    and make a queen of bel-imperia.

  king.  brother, how like you this our viceroy's love?

  cast.  no doubt, my lord, it is an argument
    of honourable care to keep his friend
    and wondrous zeal to balthazar, his son.
    nor am i least indebted to his grace,
    that bends his liking to my daughter thus.

  ambass.  now last, dread lord, here hath his highness sent--
    although he send not that his son return--
    his ransom due to don horatio.

  hiero.  horatio?  who calls horatio?

  king.  and well remember'd, thank his majesty!
    here, see it given to horati

  king.  we shall increase his melancholy so.
    'tis best that we see further in it first;
    till when, ourself will hold exempt the place.
    and, brother, now bring in the ambassador,
    that he may be a witness of the match
    'twixt balthazar and bel-imperia,
    and that we may prefix a certain time
    wherein the marriage shall be solemniz'd,
    that we may have thy lord the viceroy here.

  ambass.  therein your highness highly shall content
    his majesty, that longs to hear from hence.

  king.  on then, and hear you, lord ambassador.

    fair bel-imperia, with my balthazar,--
    with thee, my son, whom sith i live to see,
    here, take my crown, i give it to her and thee,
    and let me live a solitary life,
    in ceaseless prayers,
    to think how strangely heav'n hath thee preserved.

  king.  see, brother, see, how nature strives in him!
    come, worthy viceroy, and accompany
    thy friend, to strive with thine extremities:
    a place more private fits this princely mood.

    which to your discretion shall seem best.
    and as for me, my lords, i'll look to one,
    and with the ransom that the viceroy sent
    so furnish and perform this tragedy
    as all the world shall say hieronimo
    was liberal in gracing of it so.

  bal. hieronimo, methinks a comedy were better.

  hiero.  a comedy?  fie!  comedies are fit for common wits;
    but to present a kingly troupe withal,
    give me a stately-written tragedy,--
    tragedia cothurnata, fitting kings,
    containing matter, and not common things!
    my lords, all this our sport must be perform'd,
    as fitting for the first night's revel

  bethink thyself, hieronimo,
    recall thy wits, recompt thy former wrongs
    thou hast receiv'd by murder of thy son,
    and lastly, but not least, how isabell,
    once his mother and my dearest wife,
    all woe-begone for him, hath slain herself.
    behooves thee then, hieronimo, to be
    reveng'd!  the plot is laid of dire revenge:
    on then, hieronimo; pursue revenge,
    for nothing wants but acting of revenge!

                exit hieronimo.

                enter spanish king, viceroy, the duke
                of castile, and their train, to the gallery.

  king.  now, viceroy, shall we see the tragedy
    of suleiman, the turkish emperor,
    perform'd by pleasure by your son the prince,
    my nephew don lorenzo, and my niece.

  vice.  who?  bel-imperia?

  king.  aye; and hieronimo our marshall,
    at whose request they deign to do't themselves.
    these be our pastimes in the court of spain.
    here, brother, you shall be the book-keeper:
    this is the argument of

  balthazar. [acting]  bashaw, that rhodes is ours yield
    heav'ns the honour
    and holy mahomet, our sacred prophet!
    and be thou grac'd with every excellence
    that suleiman can give or thou desire!
    but thy desert in conquering rhodes is less
    then in reserving this fair christian nymph,
    perseda, blissful lamp of excellence,
    whose eyes compel, like powerful adamant,
    the warlike heart of suleiman to wait.

  king.  see, viceroy, that is balthazar your son,
    that represents the emperor suleiman:
    how well he acts his amorous passion!

  vice.  aye; bel-imperia hath taught him that.

  castile:  that's because his mind runs all on bel-imperia.

  hiero. [acting]  whatever joy earth yields betide your majesty!

  balt. [acting]  earth yields no joy without perseda's love.

  hiero. [acting]  let then perseda on your grace attend.

    soliciting remembrance of my vow

    which now perform'd, my heart is satisfied.
    and to this end the bashaw i became,
    that might revenge me on lorenzo's life,
    who therefore was appointed to the part
    and was to represent the knight of rhodes,
    that i might kill him more conveniently.
    so, viceroy, was this balthazar thy son--
    that suleiman which bel-imperia
    in person of perseda murdered,--
    solely appointed to that tragic part,
    that she might slay him that offended her.
    poor bel-imperia miss'd her part in this:
    for, though the story saith she should have died,
    yet i, of kindness and of care for her,
    did otherwise determine of her end.
    but love of him whom they did hate too much
    did urge her resolution to be such.
