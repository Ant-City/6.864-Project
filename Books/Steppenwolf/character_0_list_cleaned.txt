the [CHARACTER]  - 
a middle-aged recluse who lives alone in a bourgeois
lodging house. harry haller refers to himself as a "[CHARACTER]"
because he feels like a lonely wolf of the steppes, removed from
the obsessions and conventions common to most people. harry believes himself
to be divided between two extremes: a man-half who shares the ideals
and interests of humanity, and a beast-half that sees those aspirations
as futile, absurd vanities.
