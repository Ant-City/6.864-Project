    put forth toward phrygia; and their vow is made
    to ransack troy, within whose strong immures
    the ravish'd helen, menelaus' queen,
    with wanton paris sleeps-and that's the quarrel.
    to tenedos they come,
    and the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
    their war-like fraughtage. now on dardan plains
    the fresh and yet unbruised greeks do pitch
    their brave pavilions: priam's six-gated city,
    dardan, and tymbria, helias, chetas, troien,
    and antenorides, with massy staples
    and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
    sperr up the sons of troy.
    now expectation, tickling skittish spirits
    on one and other side, troyan and greek,
    sets all on hazard-and hither am i come
    a prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
    of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited
    in like conditions as our argument,
    to tell you, fair beholders, that our play
    leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,
    beginning in

 niece, do,
    sweet niece cressida.
  cressida. at your pleasure.
  pandarus. here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may see
    most bravely. i'll tell you them all by their names as they pass
    by; but mark troilus above the rest.

                       aeneas passes

  cressida. speak not so loud.
  pandarus. that's aeneas. is not that a brave man? he's one of the
    flowers of troy, i can tell you. but mark troilus; you shall see
    anon.

                       antenor passes

  cressida. who's that?
  pandarus. that's antenor. he has a shrewd wit, i can tell you; and
    he's a man good enough; he's one o' th' soundest judgments in
    troy, whosoever, and a proper man of person. when comes troilus?
    i'll show you troilus anon. if he see me, you shall see him nod
    at me.
  cressida. will he give you the nod?
  pandarus. you shall see.
  cressida. if he do, the rich shall have more.

                     hector passes

  paris. he eats nothing but doves, love; and that breeds hot blood,
    and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot thoughts beget hot
    deeds, and hot deeds is love.
  pandarus. is this the generation of love: hot blood, hot thoughts,
    and hot deeds? why, they are vipers. is love a generation of
    vipers? sweet lord, who's a-field today?
  paris. hector, deiphobus, helenus, antenor, and all the gallantry
    of troy. i would fain have arm'd to-day, but my nell would not
    have it so. how chance my brother troilus went not?
  helen. he hangs the lip at something. you know all, lord pandarus.
  pandarus. not i, honey-sweet queen. i long to hear how they spend

    made tame and most familiar to my nature;
    and here, to do you service, am become
    as new into the world, strange, unacquainted-
    i do beseech you, as in way of taste,
    to give me now a little benefit
    out of those many regist'red in promise,
    which you say live to come in my behalf.
  agamemnon. what wouldst thou of us, troyan? make demand.
  calchas. you have a troyan prisoner call'd antenor,
    yesterday took; troy holds him very dear.

    desir'd my cressid in right great exchange,
    whom troy hath still denied; but this antenor,
    i know, is such a wrest in their affairs
    that their negotiations all must slack
    wanting his manage; and they will almost
    give us a prince of blood, a son of priam,
    in change of him. let him be sent, great princes,
    and he shall buy my daughter; and her presence

enter, at one side, aeneas, and servant with a torch; at another,
paris, deiphobus, antenor, diomedes the grecian, and others, with
torches

  paris. see, ho! who is that there?
  deiphobus. it is the lord aeneas.
  aeneas. is the prince there in person?
    had i so good occasion to lie long
    as you, prince paris, nothing but heavenly business
    should rob my bed-mate of my company.
  diomedes. that's my mind too. good morrow, lord aeneas.

    witness the process of your speech, wherein
    you told how diomed, a whole

  paris. this is the most despiteful'st gentle greeting
    the noblest hateful love, that e'er i heard of.
    what business, lord, so early?
  aeneas. i was sent for to the king; but why, i know not.
  paris. his purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this greek
    to calchas' house, and there to render him,
    for the enfreed antenor, the fair cressid.
    let's have your company; or, if you please,
    haste there before us. i constantly believe-
    or rather call my thought a certain knowledge-
    my brother troilus lodges there to-night.
    rouse him and give him note of our approach,
    with the whole quality wherefore; i fear
    we shall be much unwelcome.
  aeneas. that i assure you:
    troilus had rather troy were borne to greece
    than cressid borne from troy.

y own part, i came in late. what should he do here?
  aeneas. who!-nay, then. come, come, you'll do him wrong ere you are
    ware; you'll be so true to him to be false to him. do not you
    know of him, but yet go fetch him hither; go.

                       re-enter troilus

  troilus. how now! what's the matter?
  aeneas. my lord, i scarce have leisure to salute you,
    my matter is so rash. there is at hand
    paris your brother, and deiphobus,
    the grecian diomed, and our antenor
    deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
    ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
    we must give up to diomedes' hand
    the lady cressida.
  troilus. is it so concluded?
  aeneas. by priam, and the general state of troy.
    they are at hand and ready to effect it.
  troilus. how my achievements mock me!
    i will go meet them; and, my lord aeneas,
    we met by chance; you did not find me here.

  cressida. my lord, will you be true?
  troilus. who, i? alas, it is my vice, my fault!
    whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
    i with great truth catch mere simplicity;
    whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
    with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare.

    fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
    is 'plain and true'; there's all the reach of it.
    welcome, sir diomed! here is the lady
    which for antenor we deliver you;
    at the port, lord, i'll give her to thy hand,
    and by the way possess thee what she is.
    entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair greek,
    if e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
