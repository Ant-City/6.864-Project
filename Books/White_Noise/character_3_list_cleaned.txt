[CHARACTER] - 
                project
manager responsible for the drug dylar. [CHARACTER] conducts experimental
tests of the drug from his motel room, trading dylar for sex. willie
remains a mysterious figure through most of the novel, known only
as "mr. gray." when we finally encounter him in the last two chapters
of the novel, willie has gone half-crazy and spends his days staring
vacantly at a soundless television. jack becomes fixated on [CHARACTER],
partly because he wants revenge for mink and babette's affair and
party because he wants to obtain a supply of dylar for himself.
