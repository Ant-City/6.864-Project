to climb again. gale always says i remind him of a squirrel the 
way i can scurry up even the slenderest limb. part of it’s my 
weight, but part of it’s practice. you have to know where to 
place your hands and feet. i’m another thirty feet in the air 
when i hear the crack and look down to see cato flailing as he 
and a branch go down. he hits the ground hard and i’m hoping 
he possibly broke his neck when he gets back to his feet, 
swearing like a fiend. 
the girl with the arrows, glimmer i hear someone call her 
— ugh, the names the people in district 1 give their children 
are so ridiculous — anyway glimmer scales the tree until the 
branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good 
sense to stop. i’m at least eighty feet high now. she tries to 
shoot me and it’s immediately evident that she’s incompetent 
with a bow. one of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me 
though and i’m able to seize it. i wave it teasingly above her 
head, as if this was t

was far deeper. i apply another coat of medicine and quietly 
pack up my gear. whatever happens, i’m going to have to 
move and move fast. i also make myself eat a cracker and a 
strip of beef and drink a few cups of water. 
almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday, and i’m 
already starting to feel the effects of hunger.

below me, i can see the career pack and peeta asleep on 
the ground. by her position, leaning up against the trunk of 
the tree, i’d guess glimmer was supposed to be on guard, but 
fatigue overcame her. 
my eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me, 
but i can’t make out rue. since she tipped me off, it only seems 
fair to warn her. besides, if i’m going to die today, it’s rue i 
want to win. even if it means a little extra food for my family, 
the idea of peeta being crowned victor is unbearable. 
i call rue’s name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear, 
wide and alert, at once. she points up to the nest again. i

it’s mayhem. the careers have woken to a full-scale tracker 
jacker attack. peeta and a few others have the sense to drop 
everything and bolt. i can hear cries of “to the lake! to the 
lake!” and know they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the 
water. it must be close if they think they can outdistance the 
furious insects. glimmer and another girl, the one from dis-
trict 4, are not so lucky. they receive multiple stings before 
they’re even out of my view. glimmer appears to go complete-

ly mad, shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow, 
which is pointless. she calls to the others for help but, of 
course, no one returns. the girl from district 4 staggers out of 
sight, although i wouldn’t bet on her making it to the lake. i 
watch glimmer fall, twitch hysterically around on the ground

son from the stingers makes me wobbly, but i find my way 
back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water, 
just in case any wasps are still on my trail. after about five 
minutes, i drag myself onto the rocks. people have not exagge-
rated the effects of the tracker jacker stings. actually, the one 
on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size. a foul-
smelling green liquid oozes from the places where i pulled out 
the stingers. 
the swelling. the pain. the ooze. watching glimmer 
twitching to death on the ground. it’s a lot to handle before 
the sun has even cleared the horizon. i don’t want to think 
about what glimmer must look like now. her body disfigured. 
her swollen fingers stiffening around the bow . . . 
the bow! somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought 
connects to another and i’m on my feet, teetering through the 
trees back to glimmer. the bow. the arrows. i must get them. 
i haven’t heard the cannons fire yet, so perhaps glimmer is in

venom. but once it stops and the cannon signals her death, a 
hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body, taking the only 
bow and sheath of arrows i’ve seen out of the games for good. 
and i refuse to let them slip through my fingers again! 
i reach glimmer just as the cannon fires. the tracker jack-
ers have vanished. this girl, so breathtakingly beautiful in her 
golden dress the night of the interviews, is unrecognizable. 
her features eradicated, her limbs three times their normal 
size. the stinger lumps have begun to explode, spewing putrid 
green liquid around her. i have to break several of what used 
to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow. the sheath of 
arrows is pinned under her back. i try to roll over her body by 
pulling on o

 again. a second cannon fires and i’m 
guessing the girl from district 4 has just died. i hear the birds 
fall silent and then one give the warning call, which means a 
hovercraft is about to appear. confused, i think it’s for glim-
mer, although this doesn’t quite make sense because i’m still 
in the picture, still fighting for the arrows. i lurch back onto 
my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles. in 
the middle of the sky, i spot the hovercraft. i throw myself 
over glimmer’s body as if to protect it but then i see the girl 
from district 4 being lifted into the air and vanishing.

“do this!” i command myself. clenching my jaw, i dig my 
hands under glimmer’s body, get a hold on what must be her 
rib cage, and force her onto her stomach. i can’t help it, i’m 
hyperventilating now, the whole thing is so nightmarish and 
i’m losing my grasp on what’s real. i tug on the silver sheath of 
arrows, but it’s caught on something, her should

bush. how long have i been out? it was morning when i lost rea-
son. now it’s afternoon. but the stiffness in my joints suggests 
more than a day has passed, even two possibly. if so, i’ll have 
no way of knowing which tributes survived that tracker jacker 
attack. not glimmer or the girl from district 4. but there was 
the boy from district 1, both tributes from district 2, and pee-
ta. did they die from the stings? certainly if they lived, their 
last days must have been as horrid as my own. and what 
about rue? she’s so small, it wouldn’t take much venom to do 
her in. but then again . . . the tracker jackers would’ve had to 
catch her, and she had a good head start. 
a foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water has 
little effect on it. i drag myse

those careers in the first place? none of it makes sense. 
i wonder what gale made of the incident for a moment and 
then i push the whole thing out of my mind because for some 
reason gale and peeta do not coexist well together in my 
thoughts. 
so i focus on the one really good thing that’s happened 
since i landed in the arena. i have a bow and arrows! a full 
dozen arrows if you count the one i retrieved in the tree. they 
bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from 
glimmer’s body — which leads me to believe that might not 
have been wholly real — but they have a fair amount of dried 
blood on them. i can clean them later, but i do take a minute to 
shoot a few into a nearby tree. they are more like the wea-
pons in the training center than my ones at home, but who 
cares? that i can work with. 
the weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the 
games. i know i have tough opponents left to face. but i am no 
longer merely prey that runs and hides or tak

cause i find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered ques-
tions, most of which concern peeta. the cannon that fired ear-
ly this morning, did that signify his death? if so, how did he 
die? at the hand of a career? and was that in revenge for let-
ting me live? i struggle again to remember that moment over 
glimmer’s body, when he burst through the trees. but just the 
fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that 
happened. 
i must have been moving very slowly yesterday because i 
reach the shallow stretch where i took my bath in just a few 
hours. i stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to 
my backpack. it seems bent on reverting to orange no matter 
how many times i cover it. 
my proximity to the careers’ camp sharpens my senses, 
and the closer i get to them, the more gu

flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three be-
fore they know what hit them. i return to rue’s signal fire and 
start it up, not caring about the excessive smoke.  where  are 
you, cato? i think as i roast the birds and rue’s roots. i’m wait-
who knows where the careers are now? either too far to 
reach me or too sure this is a trick or ... is it possible? too 
scared of me? they know i have the bow and arrows, of 
course, cato saw me take them from glimmer’s body, but have 
they put two and two together yet? figured out i blew up the 
supplies and killed their fellow career? possibly they think 
thresh did this. wouldn’t he be more likely to revenge rue’s 
death than i would? being from the same district? not that he 
ever took any interest in her. 
and what about foxface? did she hang around to watch me 
blow up the supplies? no. when i caught her laughing in the 
ashes the next morning, it was as if someone had given her a

early evening, i climb a tree and settle in for the night. my

know why i should even care about the boy.

then i realize . . . he was my first kill. 
along with other statistics they report to help people place 
their bets, every tribute has a list of kills. i guess technically 
i’d get credited for glimmer and the girl from district 4, too, 
for dumping that nest on them. but the boy from district 1 
was the first person i knew would die because of my actions. 
numerous animals have lost their lives at my hands, but only 
one human. i hear gale saying, “how different can it be, real-
ly?” amazingly similar in the execution. a bow pulled, an arrow 
shot. entirely different in the aftermath. i killed a boy whose 
name i don’t even know. somewhere his family is weeping for 
him. his friends ca

we stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where 
the careers trapped me. the husk of the tracker jacker nest, 
beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning 
sun, confirms the location. i touch it with the tip of my boot, 
and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the 
breeze. i can’t help looking up in the tree where rue secretly

se it lands a mere ten feet 
below us, its pink lips pulled back in a snarl. for a moment it 
hangs there, and in that moment i realize what else unsettled 
me about the mutts. the green eyes glowering at me are un-
like any dog or wolf, any canine i’ve ever seen. they are un-
mistakably human. and that revelation has barely registered 
when i notice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels 
and the whole horrible thing hits me. the blonde hair, the 
green eyes, the number . . . it’s glimmer. 
a shriek escapes my lips and i’m having trouble holding the 
arrow in place. i have been waiting to fire, only too aware of 
my dwindling supply of arrows. waiting to see if the creatures 
can, in fact, climb. but now, even though the mutt has begun to 
slide backward, unable to find any purchase on the metal, 
even though i can hear the slow screeching of the claws like 
nails on a blackboard, i fire into its throat. its body twitches 
and flops onto the ground with a thud.
