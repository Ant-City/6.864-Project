                 A
Chinese sage of the sixth century B.C., known
for his sayings and parables collected under the title Analects. His
teachings gave rise to a sort of secular religion known as Confucianism,
which served as a model for the Chinese government in subsequent centuries.
Confucius also had a significant effect on the Transcendentalist
movement, and was one of Thoreau's favorite authors.
