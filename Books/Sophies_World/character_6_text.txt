herself.
she jumped up and went into the bathroom with the strange letter in her hand. she
stood in front of the mirror and stared into her own eyes.
"i am sophie amundsen," she said.
the girl in the mirror did not react with as much as a twitch. whatever sophie did,
she did exactly the same. sophie tried to beat her reflection to it with a lightning
movement but the other girl was just as fast.
"who are you?" sophie asked.
she received no response to this either, but felt a momentary confusion as to whether
it was she or her reflection who had asked the question.
sophie pressed her index finger to the nose in the mirror and said, "you are me."
as she got no answer to this, she turned the sentence around and said, "i am you."
sophie amundsen was often dissatisfied with her appearance. she was frequently told 
that she had beautiful almond-shaped eyes, but that was probably just something
people said because her nose was too small and her mouth was a bit too big. and he

mysterious as the martian we just mentioned. you will not only have seen a being

do you follow me, sophie? let's do another experiment in thought:
one morning, mom, dad, and little thomas, aged two or three, are having breakfast
in the kitchen. after a while mom gets up and goes over to the kitchen sink, and
dad--yes, dad--flies up and floats around under the ceiling while thomas sits
watching. what do you think thomas says? perhaps he points up at his father and
says: "daddy's flying!" thomas will certainly be astonished, but then he very often is.
dad does so many strange things that this business of a little flight over the breakfast
table makes no dif

sometimes he climbs onto the roof and turns the tv aerial--or else he sticks his head
under the hood of the car and comes up black in the face.
now it's mom's turn. she hears what thomas says and turns around abruptly. how do
you think she reacts to the sight of dad floating nonchalantly over the kitchen table?
she drops the jam jar on the floor and screams with fright. she may even need
medical attention once dad has returned respectably to his chair. (he should have
learned better table manners by now!) why do you think thomas and his mother react
so differently?
it all has to do with habit. (note this!) mom has learned that people cannot fly.

by the back of the neck and pulled her up again to the tip of the fur where she had
played as a child. and there, on the outermost tips of the fine hairs, she was once
again seeing the world as if for the very first time.
the philosopher had rescued her. no doubt about it. the unknown letter writer had
saved her from the triviality of everyday existence.
when mom got home at five o'clock, sophie dragged her into the living room and
pushed her into an armchair.
"mom--don't you think it's astonishing to be alive?" she began.
her mother was so surprised that she didn't answer at first. sophie was usually doing
her homework when she got home.

"sometimes? yes, but--don't you think it's astonishing that the world exists at all?"

what paths they reached these conclusions. but what we do know enables us to
establish that the earliest greek philosophers' project concerned the question of a
basic constituent substance and the changes in nature.
three philosophers from miletus
the first philosopher we know of is thales, who came from miletus, a greek colony
in asia minor. he traveled in many countries, including egypt, where he is said to 
have calculated the height of a pyramid by measuring its shadow at the precise
moment when the length of his own shadow was equal to his height. he is also said to
have accurately predicted a solar eclipse in the year 585 b.c.
thales thought that the source of all things was water. we do not know exactly what
he meant by that, he may have believed that all life originated from water--and that all
life returns to water again when it dissolves.
during his travels in egypt he must have observed how the crops began to grow as
soon as the floods of the nile receded from the land a

on believing it was true. 
"is he the one who told you about the rabbit and the top hat?" her mother asked.
sophie nodded.
"he--he doesn't do drugs, does he?"
now sophie felt really sorry for her mother. she couldn't go on letting her worry this
way, although it was completely nutty of her to think that just because someone had a
slightly bizarre idea he must be on something. grownups really were idiotic
sometimes.
she said, "mom, i promise you once and for all i'll never do any of that stuff... and he
doesn't either. but he is very interested in philosophy."
"is he older than you?"
sophie shook her head.
"the same age?"
sophie nodded.
"well, i'm sure he's very sweet, darling. now i think you should try and get some
sleep."
but sophie stayed sitting by the window for what seemed like hours. at last she could
hardly keep her eyes open. it was one o'clock.
she was just about to go to bed when she suddenly caught sight of

any better? sophie didn't think so.
on the contrary, she thought that both children and adults did stupid things that they
probably regretted afterwards, precisely because they had done them against their
better judgment.
while she sat thinking, she heard something rustling in the dry undergrowth on the
other side of the hedge nearest the woods. could it be the messenger? her heart
started beating faster. it sounded like a panting animal was coming.
the next moment a big labrador pushed its way into the den.
in its mouth it held a big brown envelope which it dropped at sophie's feet. it all
happened so quickly that sophie had no time to react. a second later she was sitting 
with the big envelope in her hands--and the golden labrador had scampered off into
the woods again.
once it was all over she reacted. she started to cry.
she sat like that for a while, losing all sense of time.
then she looked up suddenly.
so that was his famous messenger! sophie b

 when you read this you may already have met hermes. in case you
haven't, i'll add that he is a dog. but don't worry. he is very good-tempered--and
moreover, a good deal more intelligent than a lot of people. in any event he never tries
to give the impression of being cleverer than he is.
you may also note that his name is not without significance.
in greek mythology, hermes was the messenger of the gods. he was also the god of
seafarers, but we shall not bother about that, at least not for the moment. it is more
important that hermes also gave his name to the word "hermetic," which means
hidden or inaccessible--not inappropriate for the way hermes takes care to keep the
two of us hidden from each other.
so the messenger has herewith been introduced. naturally he answers to his name and
is altogether very well behaved.

into the camera and said: "we are sitting in the old agora in athens. a sorry sight,

her mother brought her some dry clothes. sophie only just managed to hide the
philosopher's note. then they sat together in the kitchen, and her mother made some
hot chocolate.
"were you with him?" she asked after a while.
"him?" 
sophie could only think about her philosophy teacher.
"with him, yes. him.... your rabbit!"
sophie shook her head.
"what do you do when you're together, sophie? why are you so wet?"
sophie sat staring gravely at the table. but deep down inside she was laughing. poor
mom, now she had that to worry about.
she shook her head again. then more questions came raining down on her.
"now i want the truth. were you out all night? why did you go to bed with your

frightened you usually talk.

she felt sure that the philosophy teacher didn't wish her any harm, and would
certainly forgive her if he knew she had been to his cabin. but she had broken an
agreement. that was all the thanks he got for taking on her philosophic education.
how could she make up for it? sophie took out her pink notepaper and began to write:
dear philosopher, it was me who was in your cabin early sunday morning. i wanted
so much to meet you and discuss some of the philosophic problems. for the moment i
am a plato fan, but i am not so sure he was right about ideas or pattern pictures

moment anyway-- that this is a different thing. i have to admit too that i am not
altogether convinced of the immortality of the soul. personally, i have no recollections
from my former lives. if you could convince me that my deceased grandmother's soul
is happy in the world of ideas, i would be most grateful.

while her mother was taking her afternoon nap, sophie went down to the den. she
had put a lump of sugar in the pink envelope and written "to alberto" on the outside.
there was no new letter, but after a few minutes sophie heard the dog approaching.
"hermes!" she called, and the next moment he had pushed his way into the den with a
big brown envelope in his mouth.
"good boy!" sophie put her arm around the dog, which was snorting and snuffling
like a walrus. she took the pink envelope with the lump of sugar and put it in the
dog's mouth. he crawled through the hedge and made off into the woods again.
sophie opened the big envelope apprehensively, wondering whether it would contain
anything about the cabin and the boat.
it contained the usual typed pages held together with a pape

a similar "purpose" when considering the purely lifeless processes in nature.
here's an example:
why does it rain, sophie? you have probably learned at school that it rains because 
the moisture in the clouds cools and condenses into raindrops that are drawn to the
earth by the force of gravity. aristotle would have nodded in agreement. but he would
have added that so far you have only mentioned three of the causes. the "material
cause" is that the moisture (the clouds) was there at the precise moment when the air
cooled. the "efficient cause" is that the moisture cools, and the "formal cause" is that
the "form," or nature of the water, is to fall to the earth. but if you stopped there,
aristotle would add that it rains because plants and animals need rainwater in order to
grow. this he called the "final cause." aristotle assigns the raindrops a life-task, or
"purpose."
we would probably turn the whole thing upside down and say that plants grow
because they find moisture. you can see the

day you see something you are unable to classify you will get a shock. if, for example,
you discover a small whatsit, and you can't really say whether it is animal, vegetable,
or mineral--i don't think you would dare touch it.
saying animal, vegetable, and mineral reminds me of that party game where the
victim is sent outside the room, and when he comes in again he has to guess what
everyone else is thinking of. everyone has agreed to think of fluffy, the cat, which at
the moment is in the neighbor's garden. the victim comes in and begins to guess. the
others must only answer "yes" or "no." if the victim is a good aristotelian--and
therefore no victim--the game could go pretty much as follows:
is it concrete? (yes!) mineral? (no!) is it alive? (yes!) vegetable? (no!) animal?
(yes!) is it a bird? (no!) is it a mammal? (yes!) is it the whole animal? (yes!) is it a
cat? (yes!) is it fluffy? (yeah! laughter. . .)
so aristotle invented that game. we ought to give plato th

from time to time it can be necessary to clarify our concepts.
for example: is it really possible that tiny little baby mice suckle just like lambs and
piglets? mice certainly do not lay eggs. (when did i last see a mouse's egg?) so they
give birth to live young--just like pigs and sheep. but we call animals that bear live
young mammals--and mammals are animals that feed on their mother's milk. so--we
got there. we had the answer inside us but we had to think it through. we forgot for
the moment that mice really do suckle from their mother. perhaps it was because we
have never seen a baby mouse being suckled, for the simple reason that mice are
rather shy of humans when they suckle their young.
nature's scale
when aristotle "clears up" in life, he first of all points out that everything in the
natural world can be divided into two main categories. on the one hand there are
nonliving things, such as stones, drops of water, or clumps of soil. these things have

sherekan was probably out catching mice--that was a cat's nature, after all. sophie
crossed the living room toward her mother's bedroom. a vase of daffodils stood on the
coffee table. it was as if the yellow blooms bowed respectfully as sophie went by. she
stopped for a moment and let her fingers gently brush their smooth heads. "you
belong to the living part of nature too," she said. "actually, you are quite privileged
compared to the vase you are in. but unfortunately you are not able to appreciate it."
then sophie tiptoed into her mother's bedroom. although her mother was in a deep
sleep, sophie laid a hand on her forehead.

her mother lifted her head. 
"i'll be right there," she said. "will you put the coffee on?"
sophie did as she was asked, and they were soon sitting in the kitchen over coffee,
juice, and chocolate.
suddenly sophie said, "have you ever wondered why we are alive, mom?"
"oh, not again!"
"yes, because now i know the answer. people live on this planet so that someone can
go around giving names to everything."
"is that right? i never thought of that."

nity. philosophic insight, it was now thought,
did not only have its own reward; it should also free mankind from pessimism and the
fear of death. thus the boundaries between religion and philosophy were gradually
eliminated.
in general, the philosophy of hellenism was not star-tlingly original. no new plato or
aristotle appeared on the scene. on the contrary, the three great athenian
philosophers were a source of inspiration to a number of philosophic trends which i
shall briefly describe in a moment.
hellenistic science, too, was influenced by a blend of knowledge from the various
cultures. the town of alexandria played a key role here as a meeting place between
east and west. while athens remained the center of philosophy with still functioning
schools of philosophy after plato and aristotle, alexandria became the center for
science. with its extensive library, it became the center for mathematics, astronomy,
biology, and medicine.
hellenistic culture could well be compared to the worl

with a "philosophic medicine chest" containing the four ingredients i
mentioned.
in contrast to the stoics, the epicureans showed little or no interest in politics and the
community. "live in seclusion!" was the advice of epicurus. we could per-haps
compare his "garden" with our present-day communes. there are many people in our
own time who have sought a "safe harbor"--away from society.
after epicurus, many epicureans developed an overemphasis on self-indulgence.
their motto was "live for the moment!" the word "epicurean" is used in a negative
sense nowadays to describe someone who lives only for pleasure.
neoplatonism
as i showed you, cynicism, stoicism, and epicureanism all had their roots in the
teaching of socrates. they also made use of certain of the pre-socratics like
heraclitus and democritus.
but the most remarkable philosophic trend in the late hellenistic period was first and
foremost inspired by plato's philosophy. we therefore call it neoplatonism.

res; even a rose or a bluebell has its divine
glow. furthest away from the living god are earth and water and stone.
i am saying that there is something of the divine mystery in everything that exists. we
can see it sparkle in a sunflower or a poppy. we sense more of this unfathomable
mystery in a butterfly that flutters from a twig--or in a goldfish swimming in a bowl.
but we are closest to god in our own soul. only there can we become one with the
great mystery of life. in truth, at very rare moments we can experience that we
ourselves are that divine mystery.
plotinus's metaphor is rather like plato's myth of the cave: the closer we get to the
mouth of the cave, the closer we get to that which all existence springs from. but in
contrast to plato's clear two-fold reality, plotinus's doctrine is characterized by an
experience of wholeness. everything is one--for everything is god. even the shadows 
deep down in plato's cave have a faint glow of the one.

the christian mystic angelus silesius (1624-1677) put it another way: every drop
becomes the sea when it flows oceanward, just as at last the soul ascends and thus
becomes the lord.
now you might feel that it cannot be particularly pleasant to "lose oneself." i know
what you mean. but the point is that what you lose is so very much less than what you
gain. you lose yourself only in the form you have at the moment, but at the same time
you realize that you are something much bigger. you are the universe. in fact, you are
the cosmic spirit itself, sophie. it is you who are god. if you have to lose yourself as
sophie amundsen, you can take comfort in the knowledge that this "everyday i" is
something you will lose one day anyway. your real "i"-- which you can only
experience if you are able to lose yourself--is, according to the mystics, like a
mysterious fire that goes on burning to all eternity.

as soon as she had set the casserole on the stove again, the telephone rang.

"sophie amundsen," she said.

sophie was sure of three things: it was not her father. but it was a man's voice, and a
voice she knew she had heard before. 
"who is this?"
"it's alberto."
"ohhh!"
sophie was at a loss for words. it was the voice from the acropolis video that she had
recognized.

"we have to make a very special arrangement," she said as soon as her friend opened
the door.
she said no more until joanna had closed her bedroom door.
"it's rather problematic," sophie went on.
"spit it out!"
"i'm going to have to tell mom that i'm staying the night here."
"great!"
"but it's only something i'm saying, you see. i've got to go somewhere else." 
"that's bad. is it a guy?"
"no, it's to do with hilde."
joanna whistled softly, and sophie looked her severely in the eye.
"i'm coming over this evening," she said, "but at seven o'clock i've got to sneak out
again. you've got to cover for me until i get back."

the next morning sophie woke up to a big breakfast of hot rolls, orange juice, eggs,
and vegetable salad. it was not often that her mother was up before sophie on a
sunday morning. when she was, she liked to fix a solid meal for sophie.
while they were eating, mom said, "there's a strange dog in the garden. it's been
sniffing round the old hedge all morning. i can't imagine what it's doing here, can
you?"
 "yes!" sophie burst out, and at once regretted it.

sophie had already left the table and gone into the living room to look out of the
window facing the large garden. it was just as she thought.

"ah, but why did the marble travel in precisely that way?"
sophie thought deeply. then she said, "because the board was sloping, the marble

than a sensation! here i go, dragging a girl who's not yet fifteen up to my attic, and
she realizes exactly the same thing galileo did after one single experiment!"
he clapped his hands. for a moment sophie was afraid he had gone mad. he

cannonball. it is propelled into the air, it continues its path over the earth, but will

sophie had been talking with her head almost buried in her pillow. now her mother
said, "sophie--you must tell me why you seem so out of balance at the moment."
"weren't you like this when you were fifteen?"
"probably. but you know what i am talking about."
sophie suddenly turned to face her mother. "the dog's name is hermes," she said.
"it is?"
"it belongs to a man called alberto."
"i see."
"he lives down in the old town."
"you went all that way with the dog?" 
"there's nothing dangerous about that."
"you said that the dog had often been here."
"did i say that?"
she had to think now. she wanted to tell as much as possible, but she couldn't tell

now it was alberto who jumped.
"who are you?" wrote sophie.
"major albert knag at your service. i came straight from lebanon. what is your
command?" 
"this beats everything!" breathed alberto. "the rat has sneaked onto the hard disc."
he motioned for sophie to move and sat down in front of the keyboard.
"how did you manage to get into my pc?" he wrote.
"a mere bagatelle, dear colleague. i am exactly where i choose to be."
"you loathsome data virus!"
"now, now! at the moment i am here as a birthday virus. may i send a special
greeting?"
"no thanks, we've had enough of them."
"but i'll be quick: all in your honor, dear hilde. once again, a very happy fifteenth
birthday. please excuse the circumstances, but i wanted my birthday greetings to
spring up around you everywhere you go. love from dad, who is longing to give you
a great big hug."
before alberto could write again, the sign c: had once again appeared on the screen.

send it to a girl he hardly knows. when was he in athens?"
"i haven't a clue."
"but there's something else ..." 
"what?"
 "he looks very much like the major who lived in that little hut in the woods."
"well maybe it is him, mom."
"but nobody has seen him for over fifteen years."
"he probably moved around a lot... to athens, maybe."
her mother shook her head. "when i saw him sometime in the seventies, he wasn't a

"knox?"
"could be, sophie. could be his name was knox."

exactly two weeks went by without sophie hearing a word from alberto. she got
another birthday card for hilde, but although the actual day was approaching, she did
not receive a single birthday card herself.
one afternoon she went to the old town and knocked on alberto's door. he was out,
but there was a short note attached to his door. it said:
happy birthday, hilde! now the great turning point is at hand. the moment of truth,
little one. every time i think about it, i can't stop laughing. it has naturally something 
to do with berkeley, so hold on to your hat.
sophie tore the note off the door and stuffed it into alberto's mailbox as she went out.
damn! surely he'd not gone back to athens? how could he leave her with so many
questions unanswered?

the garden was neither especially luxuriant nor particularly well kept. but it was
large and it was hilde's. a weather-beaten apple tree and a few practically barren fruit
bushes had just about survived the severe winter storms. the old glider stood on the
lawn between granite rocks and thicket. it looked so forlorn in the sharp morning light.
even more so because the cushions had been taken in. mom had probably hurried out
late last night and rescued them from the rain.
there were birch trees--bj0rketreer--all around the large garden, sheltering it partly, at
least, from the worst squalls. it was because of those trees that the house had been
renamed bjerkely over a hundred years ago.
hilde's great-grandfather had built the house some years before the turn of the century.
he had been a captain on one of the last tall sailing ships. there were a lot of people
who continued to call it the c

den.
"happy birthday ..." her mother had begun to sing halfway up the stairs.
"come in," said hilde, in the middle of the passage where the philosophy teacher was
talking directly to sophie from the acropolis. he looked almost exactly like hilde's
father--with a "black, well-trimmed beard" and a blue beret.
"happy birthday, hilde!" 
"uh-huh."
"hilde?"
"just put it there."
"aren't you going to ... ?"
"you can see i'm reading."
"imagine, you're fifteen!"
"have you ever been to athens, mom?"
"no, why do you ask?"
"it's so amazing that those old temples are still standing. they are actually 2,500 years
old. the biggest one is called the virgin's place, by the way."
"have you opened your present from dad?"
"what present?"
 "you must look up now, hilde. you're in a complete daze."
hilde let the large ring binder slide down onto her lap.
her mother stood leaning over the bed with the tray. on it were lighted candles,
buttered rolls with shrimp salad, and a soda. there was also a smal

mother stood awkwardly holding the tray with both hands, with a flag under one arm.
"oh, thanks a lot, mom. it's sweet of you, but i'm really busy."
"you don't have to go to school till one o'clock."
not until now did hilde remember where she was, and her mother put the tray down
on the bedside table. 
"sorry, mom. i was completely absorbed in this."
"what is it he has written, hilde? i've been just as mystified as you. it's been
impossible to get a sensible word out of him for months."
for some reason hilde felt embarrassed. "oh, it's just a story."
"a story?"
"yes, a story. and a history of philosophy. or something like that."
"aren't you going to open the package from me?"
hilde didn't want to be unfair, so she opened her mother's present right away. it was a
gold bracelet.
"it's lovely, mom! thank yo

u very much!"
hilde got out of bed and gave her mother a hug.
they sat talking for a while.
then hilde said, "i have to get back to the book, mom. right now he's standing on
top of the acropolis."
"who is?"
"i've no idea. neither has sophie. that's the whole point."
"well, i have to get to work. don't forget to eat something. your dress is on a hanger
downstairs."
finally her mother disappeared down the stairs. so did sophie's philosophy teacher;
he walked down the steps from the acropolis and stood on the areopagos rock before
appearing a little later in the old square of athens.
hilde shivered when the old buildings suddenly rose from

hilde that her father had put into the story instead of sending by mail.
dear hilde, i assume you are still celebrating your fifteenth birthday. or is this the
morning after? anyway, it makes no difference to your present. in a sense, that will
last a lifetime. but i'd like to wish you a happy birthday one more time. perhaps you
understand now why i send the cards to sophie. i am sure she will pass them on to
you.
p.s. mom said you had lost your wallet. i hereby promise to reimburse you the 150
crowns. you will probably be able to get another school i.d. before they close for the
summer vacation. love from dad.
not bad! that made her 150 crowns richer. he probably thought a homemade present
alone wasn't enough.
so it appeared that june 15 was sophie's birthday, too. but sophie's calendar had only
gotten as far as the middle of may. that must have been when her father had written
this chapter, and he had postdated

ing them directly to his daughter.
hilde, like sophie, was elevated to the celestial spheres as she read about plotinus.
i believe there is something of the divine mystery in everything that exists. we can
see it sparkle in a sunflower or a poppy. we sense more of the unfathomable mystery
in a butterfly that flutters from a twig-- or in a goldfish swimming in a bowl. but we
are closest to god in our own soul. only there can we become one with the greatest
mystery of life. in truth, at very rare moments we can experience that we ourselves
are that divine mystery.
this was the most giddying passage hilde had read up to now. but it was nevertheless
the simplest. everything is one, and this "one" is a divine mystery that everyone 
shares.
this was not really something you needed to believe. it is so, thought hilde. so
everyone can read what they like into the word "divine."
she turned quickly to the next chapter. sophie and joanna go camping the night
before the national holiday on may 17. th

so she really had lost it. all right, but how had her father known it when she didn't
even know it herself?
and another thing: sophie had apparently dreamed that hilde's father came home
from lebanon. but there was still a week to go before that happened. was sophie's
dream prophetic? did her father mean that when he came home sophie would 
somehow be there? he had written that she would get a new friend ...

"yes, i did."

"it's an old stone church from the middle ages."

she let the ring binder fall into her lap and looked up at her mother.
"i forgot the time, mom. i'm sorry, but i'm reading something terribly exciting."
her mother could not help smiling.
"it's a magic book," added hilde.
"okay. happy birthday once again, hilde!" 
"hey, i don't know if i can take that phrase any more."
"but i haven't... i'm just going to rest for a while, then i'll start fixing a great dinner. i

"okay, i'll go on reading."
her mother left and hilde read on.

the blackest piece of all was the violent storm. she had practically been in shock. her
mother had rubbed her dry with a towel and simply put her to bed with a cup of hot
milk and honey. she had fallen asleep immediately.
"i think i'm still alive," she said weakly.
"of course you're alive! and today you are fifteen years old."
"are you quite sure?"
"quite sure. shouldn't a mother know when her only child was born? june 15, 1975 ...
and half-past one, sophie. it was the happiest moment of my life."
"are you sure it isn't all only a dream?"
"it must be a good dream to wake up to rolls and soda and birthday presents."
she put the tray of presents on a chair and disappeared out of the room for a second.
when she came back she was carrying another tray with rolls and soda. she put it on
the end of the bed.
it was the signal for the traditional birthday morning ritual, with the unpacking of
presents and her mother's sentimental flights back to her first contractions fifteen

"i don't know what to think."
"that is the finest virtue a genuine philosopher can have. i am proud of how much
you have learned in such a short time." 
"i am scared that nothing is real."
"that's called existential angst, or dread, and is as a rule only a stage on the way to
new consciousness."

"no, now you're oversimplifying things."

"would you claim that people plan everything they dream? it may be that hilde's
father knows everything we do. it may be just as difficult to escape his omniscience as
it is to run away from your own shadow. however-- and this is where i have begun to
devise a plan--it is not certain that the major has already decided on everything that is
to happen. he may not decide before the very last minute--that is to say, in the
moment of creation. precisely at such moments we may possibly have an initiative of
our own which guides what we say and do. such an initiative would naturally
constitute extremely weak impulses compared to the major's heavy artillery. we are
very likely defenseless against intrusive external forces such as talking dogs,
messages in bananas, and thunderstorms booked in advance. but we cannot rule out
our stubbornness, however weak it may be."
"how could that be possible?"
"the major naturally knows

"i think there's one more birthday greeting to come. but that one is set to music."
 "i'd better read a little more before i go to sleep."
"you haven't given up, then?"
"i've learned more in this one day than ever before. i can hardly believe that it's less
than twenty-four hours since sophie got home from school and found the first
envelope."
"it's strange how little time it takes to read."
"but i can't help feeling sorry for her."
"for mom?"
"no, for sophie, of course."
"why?"
"the poor girl is totally confused."
"but she's only ..."

"yes, something like that."
"i think sophie and alberto really exist."

"okay."
"have a nice day."

"i don't think you should worry too much about that." "nevertheless, from now on i
intend to ignore all extraordinary phenomena such as sea serpents and the like. let's

sophie noticed a pair of glasses lying on a small table between two armchairs. she 
also noticed that the lenses were red.
maybe they were strong sunglasses . . .
"it's almost two o'clock," she said. "i have to be home before five. mom has probably
made plans for my birthday."
"that gives us three hours."
"let's start."
"immanuel kant was born in 1724 in the east prussian town of konigsberg, the son of
a master saddler. he lived there practically all his life until he died at the age of eighty.
his family was deeply pious, and his own religious conviction formed a significant
background to his philosophy. like berkeley, he felt it was essential to preserve the
foundations of christian belief."
"i've heard enough about berkele

like the banana message and that idiotic thunderstorm."
"do you think ... ?"
"but i said i had a plan. as long as we stick to our reason, he can't trick us. because in
a way we are free. he can let us 'perceive' all kinds of things; nothing would surprise
me. if he lets the sky go dark or elephants fly, i shall only smile. but seven plus five is
twelve. that's a fact that survives all his comic-strip effects. philosophy is the
opposite of fairy tales."
sophie sat for a moment staring at him in amazement.
"off you go," he said finally. "i'll call you for a session on romanticism. you also
need to hear about hegel and kierkegaard. but there's only a week to go before the
major arrives at kjevik airport. before then, we must manage to free ourselves from
his gluey fantasies. i'll say no more, sophie. except that i want you to know i'm
working on a wonderful plan for both of us."
"i'll be off, then."
"wait--we may have forgotten the most important thing."

that kant was the
father of the un idea. kant's point was that man's "practical reason" requires the
nations to emerge from their wild state of nature which creates wars, and contract to
keep the peace. although the road to the establishment of a league of nations is
laborious, it is our duty to work for the "universal and lasting securing of peace." the
establishment of such a league was for kant a far-distant goal. you could almost say it
was philosophy's ultimate goal. i am in lebanon at the moment. love, dad.

the visitors arrived shortly before half-past seven. the atmosphere was somewhat
formal--sophie's mother very seldom saw joanna's parents socially.
it was not long before sophie and joanna went upstairs to sophie's room to write the
garden party invitations. since alberto knox was also to be invited, sophie had the
idea of inviting people to a "philosophical garden party." joanna didn't object. it was
sophie's party after all, and theme parties were "in" at the moment.
finally they had composed the invitation. it had taken two hours and they couldn't
stop laughing.

genre was passionately cultivated by the romantics. one of the german masters of
the genre was e.t.a, hoffmann."
"i've heard of the tales of hoffmann."
"the fairy tale was the absolute literary ideal of the romantics--in the same way that
the absolute art form of the baroque period was the theater. it gave the poet full scope
to explore his own creativity."
"he could play god to a fictional universe."
"precisely. and this is a good moment to sum up."
"go ahead."
"the philosophers of romanticism viewed the 'world soul' as an 'ego' which in a more
or less dreamlike state created everything in the world. the philosopher fichte said
that nature stems from a higher, unconscious imagination. scheliing said explicitly
that the world is 'in god.' god is aware of some of it, he believed, but there are other 
aspects of nature which represent the unknown in god. for god also has a dark side."

the fairy tale gave the writer free rein to exploit his 'universe-creating imagination.'
and even the creative act was not always completely conscious. the writer could
experience that his story was being written by some innate force. he could practically
be in a hypnotic trance while he wrote."
"he could?"
"yes, but then he would suddenly destroy the illusion. he would intervene in the story
and address ironic comments to the reader, so that the reader, at least momentarily,
would be reminded that it was, after all, only a story."
"i see."
"at the same time the writer could remind his reader that it was he who was
manipulating the fictional universe. this form of disillusion is called 'romantic irony.'
henrik ibsen, for example, lets one of the characters in peer gynt say: 'one cannot die
in the middle of act five.' "
"that's a very funny line, actually. what he's really saying is that he's only a fictional
character."
"the statement is so paradoxical that

"that's exactly what i am planning. but before that can happen, we must try and talk
with hilde. she reads every word we say. once we succeed in getting away from here 
it will be much harder to contact her. that means we must grasp the opportunity now."
"what do we say?"
"i think the major is just about to fall asleep over his typewriter--although his fingers
are still racing feverishly over the keys ..."
"it's a creepy thought."
"this is the moment when he may write something he will regret later. and he has no
correction fluid. that's a vital part of my plan. may no one give the major a bottle of
correction fluid!"
"he won't get so much as a single coverup strip from me!"
"i'm calling on that poor girl here and now to rebel against her own father. she should
be ashamed to let herself be amused by his self-indulgent playing with shad-ows. if
only we had him here, we'd give him a taste of our indignation!"

around us is the major's ego."
"but he is more than what we can see here."
"we are but shadows in the major's soul. and it is no easy matter for a shadow to turn
on its master, sophie. it requires both cunning and strategy. but we have an
opportunity of influencing hilde. only an angel can rebel against god."
"we could ask hilde to give him a piece of her mind the moment he gets home. she
could tell him he's a rogue. she could wreck his boat--or at least, smash the lantern."
alberto nodded. then he said: "she could also run away from him that would be
much easier for her than it is for us. she could leave the major's house and never
return. wouldn't that be fitting for a major who plays with his 'universe-creating
imagination' at our expense?" 
"i can picture it. the major travels all over the world searching for hilde. but hilde

ven if he had only made alberto and sophie up, there were limits to the show of
power he ought to permit himself.
poor sophie and alberto! they were just as defenseless against the major's
imagination as a movie screen is against the film projector.
hilde would certainly teach him a lesson when he got home! she could already see
the outline of a really good plan.
she got up and went to look out over the bay. it was almost two o'clock. she opened
the window and called over toward the boathouse.
"mom!"
her mother came out.
"i'll be down with some sandwiches in about an hour. okay?" "fine." "i just have to
read a chapter on hegel."
alberto and sophie had seated themselves in the two chairs by the window facing the
lake.
"georg wilhelm friedrich hege/was a legitimate child of romanticism," began
alberto. "one could almost say he developed with the german spirit as it gradually
evolved in germany. he was born in stuttgart in 1770, and began to study theology in

"what kind of truths can they be?"
"if i say life is short, for example . . ."
"i would agree."
"but on another occasion i could throw open my arms and say life is long."
"you're right. that's also true, in a sense."
"finally i'll give you an example of how a dialectic tension can result in a
spontaneous act which leads to a sudden change."
"yes, do."
"imagine a young girl who always answers her mother with yes, mom ... okay,
mom ... as you wish, mom ... at once, mom." 
"gives me the shudders!"
"finally the girl's mother gets absolutely maddened by her daughter's overobedience,
and shouts: stop being such a goody-goody! and the girl answers: okay, mom."
"i would have slapped her."
"perhaps. but what would you have done if the girl had answered instead: but i wonf
to be a goody-goody?"
"that would have been an odd answer. maybe i would have slapped her anyway."
"in other words, the situation was deadlocked.

"no reason. just small talk."

as soon as they finished eating, hilde collected the mugs and plates on the tray.
"i have to get on with my reading, mom."
"i guess you must."
was there a touch of reproach in her voice? they had talked about fixing up the boat
together before dad came home.
"dad almost made me promise to finish the book before he got home."

you can't imagine how much he enjoys it."

questions on what the world is and what a man is. buddha answered by likening the
monk to a man who gets pierced by a poisoned arrow. the wounded man would have
no theoretical interest in what the arrow was made of, what kind of poison it was
dipped in, or which direction it came from."
"he would most likely want somebody to pull it out and treat the wound."
"yes, he would. that would be existentially important to him. both buddha and
kierkegaard had a strong sense of only existing for a brief moment. and as i said,
then you don't sit down behind a desk and philosophize about the nature of the world
spirit."
"no, of course not."
"kierkegaard also said that truth is 'subjective.' by this he did not mean that it doesn't
matter what we think or believe. he meant that the really important truths are personal.
only these truths are 'true for me.' "
"could you give an example of a subjective truth?"
"an important question is, for example, whether christianity is true. this is not a

"kierkegaard believed that there were three different forms of life. he himself used 
the term stages. he calls them the aesthetic stage, the ethical stage, and the religious
stage. he used the term 'stage' to emphasize that one can live at one of the two lower
stages and then suddenly leap to a higher stage. many people live at the same stage all
their life."
"i bet there's an explanation on the way. i'm anxious to know which stage i'm at."
 "he who lives at the aesthetic stage lives for the moment and grasps every
opportunity of enjoyment. good is whatever is beautiful, satisfying, or pleasant. this
person lives wholly in the world of the senses, and is a slave to his own desires and
moods. everything that is boring is bad."
"yes thanks, i think i know that attitude."
"the typical romantic is thus also the typical aesthete, since there is more to it than
pure sensory enjoyment. a person who has a reflective approach to reality--or for that
matter to his art or the philosophy he or she

open arms of the living god,' as kierkegaard put it, it is the only path to redemption."
"christianity, you mean." 
"yes, because to kierkegaard, the religious stage was christianity. but he also became
significant to non-christian thinkers. existentialism, inspired by the danish
philosopher, flourished widely in the twentieth century."

she waved to the philosopher and ran down to the boat.

had certainly not been realistic. she had done nothing but read all day long. but he

when sophie slipped out of the den through the hedge it was almost eight o'clock.
her mother was weeding the flowerbeds by the front door when sophie appeared.
"where did you spring from?"
"i came through the hedge."
"through the hedge?"
"didn't you know there was a path on the other side?"
"but where have you been, sophie? this is the second time you've just disappeared
without leaving any message."
"i'm sorry, mom. it was such a lovely day, i went for a long walk."
her mother rose from the pile of weeds and gave her a severe look.
"you haven't been with that philosopher again?"
"as a matter of fact, i have. i told you he likes going for long walks."
"but he is coming to the garden party, isn't he?"
"oh yes, he's looking forward to it."
"me too. i'm counting the days."
was there a touch of sharpness in her voice? to be on the safe side, sophie said:

suddenly she exclaimed:

"the devil?"
"or mephistopheles--in goethe's faust 'was soil uns denn das ew'ge schaffen!

 "but what do those words mean exactly?" "as faust dies and looks back on his life's

then to the moment could i say:

now records of my earthly dayno flights of aeons can impair--foreknowledge comes,
and fills me with such bliss,i take my joy, my highest moment this."
"that was very poetic."
"but then it's the devil's turn. as soon as faust dies, he exclaims:

unconscious. freud wrote: 'the young girl was ill and displaying severe hysterical
symptoms. when i began treating her it appeared that she had thoroughly forgotten
about the scene at her sister's bedside and the odious egoistic impulse that had

agitation she reproduced the pathogenic moment and through this treatment became
cured.' "
"now i better understand what you meant by an archeology of the soul."
"so we can give a general description of the human psyche. after many years of
experience in treating patients, freud concluded that the conscious constitutes only a
small part of the human mind. the conscious is like the tip of the iceberg above sea
level. below sea level--or below the threshold of the conscious--is the 'subconscious,'
or the unconscious."

where the dream ended.
she remembered some lines of a poem by arnulf 0verland:
wakened one night by a curious dreamand a voice that seemed to be speaking to
melike a far-off subterranean stream,i rose and asked: what do you want of me?
she was still standing at the window when her mother came in.

"i'm not sure..."
"i'll be home around four, as usual."
"okay, mom."
"have a nice vacation day, hilde!" 
"you have a good day too."
when she heard her mother slam the front door, she slipped back into bed with the
ring binder.
"i'm going to dive down into the major's unconscious. that's where i'll be until we
meet again."
there, yes. hilde started reading again. she could feel under her right index finger
that there were only a few pages left.

she was not in the habit of going into cafes on her own. should she just turn around
and leave, and come back later to see if he had arrived?

tables. she stared at the door. people came and went all the time, but there was still no

if only she had a newspaper!
as time passed, she started to look around. she got a couple of glances in return. for a
moment sophie felt like a young woman. she was only fifteen, but she could certainly
have passed for seventeen--or at least, sixteen and a half. 
she wondered what all these people thought about being alive. they looked as though
they had simply dropped in, as though they had just sat down here by chance. they
were all talking away, gesticulating vehemently, but it didn't look as though they were
talking about anything that mattered.
she suddenly came to think of kierkegaard, who had said that what

what was going to happen now? what could happen now? there were only a few

sophie met her mother on the bus on her way home from town. oh, no! what would
her mother say when she saw the book in sophie's hand?
sophie tried to put it in the bag with all the streamers and balloons she had bought for
the party but she didn't quite make it.
"hi, sophie! we caught the same bus! how nice!"
"hi, mom!"
"you bought a book?"
"no, not exactly."
"sophie's world ... how curious."
sophie knew she didn't have the slightest chance of lying to her mother.

"does it really say that?"
"yes, it does, sophie. it's written by someone called albert knag. he must be a
newcomer. what's your al-berto's name, by the way?"
"knox."
"it'll probably turn out that this extraordinary person has written a whole book about
you, sophie. it's called using a pseudonym."
"it's not him, mom. why don't you just give up. you don't understand anything
anyway."
"no, i don't suppose i do. the garden party is tomorrow, then everything will be all
right again."
"albert knag lives in a completely different reality. that's why this book is a white
crow."
"you really must stop all this! wasn't it a white rabbit?"
"you stop it!"
that was as far as they got before they reached their stop at the end of clover close.
they ran straight into a demonstration.

"it was a mere bagatelle."
"the world changes more and more rapidly all the time. actually, i'm not in the least

"you should be surprised that you're not surprised, at any rate."
 "not at all. they weren't violent, were they? i just hope they haven't trampled all
over our rosebeds. surely it can't be necessary to demonstrate in a garden. let's hurry
home and see."
"it was a philosophical demonstration, mom. real philosophers don't trample on
rosebeds."
"i'll tell you what, sophie. i don't think i believe in real philosophers any longer.
everything is synthetic nowadays."
they spent the afternoon and evening preparing. they continued the next morning,
setting and decorating the table. joanna came over to give them a hand.

everything was ready half an hour before the guests were due. the trees were

findings. we shall reveal the innermost secrets of our existence."
the little gathering was now so quiet that the only sounds were the twittering of the
birds and a few subdued noises from the red-currant bushes. "go on," said sophie.
"after a thorough philosophical study--which has led from the first greek
philosophers to the present day--we have discovered that we are living our lives in the
mind of a major who is at this moment serving as a un observer in lebanon. he has
also written a book about us for his daughter back in lillesand. her name is hilde
mailer knag, and she was fifteen years old on the same day as sophie. the book
about us lay on her bedside table when she woke up early on the morning of june 15.
to be more precise, it was in the form of a ring binder. even as we speak, she can feel
the final pages of the ring binder under her index finger."

the philosophy course has not been purely theoretical. it has also had its practical side.
when the time is ripe we will perform our disappearing act. that is how we are going
to sneak our way out of the major's consciousness."
helene amundsen took hold of her daughter's arm.
"you are not leaving me, are you, sophie?"
sophie put her arms around her mother. she looked up at alberto.
"mom is so sad . . ."
"no, that's just ridiculous. don't forget what you have learned. it's this sort of
nonsense we must liberate ourselves from. your mother is a sweet and kind lady, just
as the little red ridinghood who came to my door that day had a basket filled with
food for her grandmother. your mother is no more sad than the plane that just flew
over needed fuel for its congratulation maneuvers."
"i think i see what you mean," said sophie, and turned back to her mother. "that's

"i'm going to miss you," said her mother, "but if there is a heaven over this one, you'll

leaves a day?"
alberto put his hand on her shoulder.
"neither you nor anyone else here will miss us for the simple reason that you do not
exist. you are no more than shadows."
"that is the worst insult i've ever heard," mrs. ingebrigtsen burst out. 
her husband nodded.
"if nothing else, we

he's a communist. he wants to strip us of everything we hold dear. the man's a

with that, both alberto and the financial adviser sat down. the letter's face was
crimson with rage. now joanna and jeremy also came and sat at the table. their
clothes were grubby and crumpled. joanna's golden hair was caked with mud and
earth.
"mom, i'm going to have a baby," she announced.
"all right, but you'll have to wait till you get home."
she had immediate support from her husband. "she'll simply have to contain herself,"
he said. "and if there is to be a christening tonight, she'll have to arrange it herself."
alberto looked down at sophie with a somber expression.
"it's time."
"can't you at least bring us a little more coffee before you go?" asked her mother.
"of course, mom, i'll do it right away."
sophie took the thermos from t

"do you want to play a game?"
he grabbed a bottle of beer, drank it down, and set the empty bottle in the middle of
the lawn. then he went to the table and fetched the last five rings of the birthday cake.
he showed the other guests how to throw the rings so they landed over the neck of the
bottle.
"the death throes," said alberto. "we'd better get away before the major ends it all
and hilde closes the ring binder."
"you'll have to clear up alone, mom."
"it doesn't matter, child. this was no life for you. if alberto can give you a better one,
nobody will be happier than i. didn't you tell me he had a white horse?"
sophie looked out across the garden. it was unrecognizable. bottles, chicken bones, 
buns, and balloons were trampled into the grass.
"this was once my little garden of eden," she said.
"and now you're being driven out of it," said alberto.
one of the boys was sitting in the white mercedes. he revved the engine and the car

sophie felt a hard grip on her arm as she was dragged into the den. then she heard
alberto's voice:
"now!"
at the same moment the white mercedes crashed into an apple tree. unripe fruit
showered down onto the hood.
"that's going too far!" shouted the financial adviser. "i demand substantial
compensation!"
his wife gave him her full support.
"it's that damned scoundrel's fault! where is he?"
"they have vanished into thin air," said helene amundsen, not without a touch of
pride.
she drew herself up to her full height, walked toward the long table and began to clear

had she managed that?
he put the envelope in his breast pocket and began to stroll toward the little shopping
mall. he was just about to enter the danish food deli when he noticed a small
envelope taped to the store window. it had major knag written on it with a thick
marker pen. albert took it down and opened it:
personal message for major albert knag, c/o danish food, kastrup airport. dear
dad, please buy a large danish salami, preferably a two-pound one, and mom would
probably like a cognac sausage. p. s. danish caviar is not bad either. love, hilde.
albert turned around. she wasn't here, was she? had mark given her a trip to
copenhagen so she could meet him here? it was hilde's handwriting ...
suddenly the un observer began to feel himself observed. it was as if someone was
in remote control of everything he did. he felt like a doll in the hands of a child.
he went into the shop and bought a two-pound salami, a cognac sausage, and three
jars of danish

a mini-tv cost 985 danish crowns. that could certainly be called a bagatelle in
comparison with how albert knag felt about being directed hither and thither by his
daughter's sneaky tricks. was she here--or was she not?
from that moment on, he was constantly on guard wherever he went. he felt like a
secret agent and a marionette rolled into one. was he not being deprived of his basic
human rights?
he felt obliged to go into the tax free store as well. there hung a new envelope with
his name on it. the whole airport was becoming a computer game with him as the
cursor. he read the message:

albert sighed despairingly, but he went into the store and shopped as instructed. with
three plastic carriers and his flight bag he walked toward gate 28 to wait for his flight.
if there were any more messages they would have to stay there.
however, at gate 28 he caught sight of another white envelope ta

control over your movements is more ingenious than that. i can see you wherever you
are, dad. the fact is, i have been to visit a well-known gypsy family which many,

wiped away her tears. 
"shall we say we're quits?" she asked.
"we're quits."
they sat down at the table. first of all hilde had to have an exact description of
everything that had happened at kastrup and on the way home. they kept bursting out
laughing.
"didn't you see the envelope in the cafeteria?"
"i didn't get a chance to sit down and eat anything, you villain. now i'm ravenous."
"poor dad."
"the stuff about the turkey was all bluff, then?"
"it certainly was not! i have prepared everything. mom's doing the serving."
then they had to go over the ring binder and the story of sophie and alberto from one
end to the other and backwards and forwards.
mom brought out the turkey and the waldorf salad, the rose wine and hilde's
homemade bread.
her father was just saying something about plato when hilde suddenly interrupted
him: "shh!"
"what is it?"
"didn't you hear it? something squeaking?"
"no."
"i'm sure i heard something. i guess it was just a field mouse."

"but you have a family yourself. and you have a cat, two birds, and a tortoise."
"but we left all that behind, didn't we?"
"by no means. it's only the major who left it behind. he has written the final word of
his book, my dear, and he will never find us again."
"does that mean we can go back?"
"anytime we want. but we're also going to make new friends in the woods behind
cinderella's cafeteria."
the knag family began their meal. for a moment sophie was afraid it would turn out
like the philosophical garden party in clover close. at one point it looked as though
the major intended to lay marit across the table. but then he drew her on to his knee
instead.
the car was parked a good way away from where the family sat eating. their
conversation was only audible now and then. sophie and alberto sat gazing down
over the garden. they had plenty of time to mull over all the details and the sorry
ending of the garden party.

hilde settled herself comfortably in the glider beside her father. it was nearly

light sky. gentle waves lapped over the stones under the dock.
her father broke the silence.

"that would be an obvious conclusion. but on this point theory is divided. it may be
that the expansion of the universe is something that will only happen this one time.
but if it keeps on expanding for all eternity, the question of where it all began
becomes even more pressing."
"yes, where did it come from, all that stuff that suddenly exploded?"
"for a christian, it would be obvious to see the big bang as the actual moment of
creation. the bible tells us that god said 'let there be light!' you may possibly also
