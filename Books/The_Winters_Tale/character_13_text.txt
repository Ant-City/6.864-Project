or thou wert born a fool. camillo's flight,
added to their familiarity,--
which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
that lack'd sight only, nought for approbation,
but only seeing, all other circumstances
made up to th' deed,--doth push on this proceeding.
yet, for a greater confirmation,--
for, in an act of this importance, 'twere
most piteous to be wild,--i have despatch'd in post
to sacred delphos, to apollo's temple,
cleomenes and dion, whom you know
of stuff'd sufficiency: now, from the oracle
they will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had,
shall stop or spur me. have i done well?

well done, my lord,--

leontes.
though i am satisfied, and need no more
than what i know, yet shall the oracle
give rest to the minds of others such as he
whose ignorant credulity will not
come up to th' truth: so have we thought it good
from our free person she should be confin'd;
lest that the treachery of the two fl

                 please your highness, posts
from those you sent to the oracle are come
an hour since: cleomenes and dion,
being well arriv'd from delphos, are both landed,
hasting to the court.

                      so please you, sir, their speed
hath been beyond account.

you here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
that you, cleomenes and dion, have

of great apollo's priest; and that since then,
you have not dar'd to break the holy seal,

sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
a saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make
which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
more penitence than done trespass: at the last,
do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
with them, forgive yourself.

upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,

you might have spoken a thousand things that would
have done the time more benefit, and grac'd
your kindness better.

may drop upon his kingdom, and devour

for present comfort, and for future good,--
to bless the bed of majesty again
