during the last thirty years of his life, albert einstein sought relentlessly for a so-called unified field
theory—a  theory  capable  of  describing  nature's  forces  within  a  single,  all-encompassing,  coherent
framework. einstein was not motivated by the things we often associate wi

predecessors  to  piece  together  an  ever  fuller  understanding  of  how  the  universe  works. and  now,
long  after  einstein  articulated  his  quest  for  a  unified  theory  but  came  up  empty-handed,  physicists
believe  they  have  finally  found  a  framework  for  stitching  these  insights  together  into  a  seamless
whole—a  single  theory  that,  in  principle,  is  capable  of  describing  all  physical  phenomena.  the
theory, superstring theory, is the subject of this book.

the past few years, i have witnessed a widespread yearning to understand what current research says

my colleagues in other scientific disciplines, i hope this book will give an honest and balanced sense

superstring theory casts a wide net. it is a broad and deep subject that draws on many of the
central discoveries in physics. since the theory unifies the laws of the large and of the small, laws

tied up with string

calling it a cover-up would be far too dramatic. but for more than half a century—even in the midst
of some of the greatest scientific achievements in history—physicists have been quietly aware of a
dark cloud looming on a distant horizon. the problem is this: there are two foundational pillars upon
which modern physics rests. one is albert einstein's general relativity, which provides a theoretical
framework for understanding the universe on the largest of scales: stars, galaxies, cluster

happy amalgam of these two theories. even if you are willing
to keep the deep interior of a black hole and the beginning of the universe shrouded in mystery, you
can't help feeling that the hostility between quantum mechanics and general relativity cries out for a
deeper  level  of  understanding.  can  it  really  be  that  the  universe  at  its  most  fundamental  level  is
divided, requiring one set of laws when things are large and a different, incompatible set when things
are small?

superstring theory, a young upstart compared with the venerable edifices of quantum mechanics
and  general  relativity,  answers  with  a  resounding  no.  intense  research  over  the  past  decade  by
physicists and mathematicians around the world has revealed that this new approach to describing

matter  at  its  most  fundamental  level  resolves  the  tension  between  general  relativity  and  quantum
mechanics. in fact, superstring theory shows more: within this new framework, general relativity an

quantum  mechanics require  one  another  for  the  theory  to  make  sense.  according  to  superstring
theory, the marriage of the laws of the large and the small is not only happy but inevitable.

that's part of the good news. but superstring theory—string theory, for short—takes this union
one giant step further. for three decades, einstein sought a unified theory of physics, one that would
interweave  all  of  nature's  forces  and  material  constituents  within  a  single  theoretical  tapestry.  he
failed. now, at the dawn of the new millennium, proponents of string theory claim that the threads of
this elusive unified tapestry finally have been revealed. string theory has the potential to show that all
of the wondrous happenings in the un

iverse—from the frantic dance of subatomic quarks to the stately
waltz of orbiting binary stars, from the primordial fireball of the big bang to the majestic swirl of
heavenly galaxies—are reflections of one grand physical principle, one master equation.

because these features of string theory require that we drastically change our understanding of
space, time, and matter, they will take some time to get used to, to sink in at a comfortable level. but
as shall become clear, when seen in its proper context, string theory emerges as a dramatic yet natural
outgrowth of the revolutionary discoveries of physics during the past hundred years. in fact, we shall
see that the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics is actually not the first, but the
third in a sequenc

century  conceptions  of  physics  were  applied  to  the  microscopic  world.  and  as
mentioned  above,  the  third  and  deepest  conflict  arises  from  the  incompatibility  between  quantum
mechanics and general relativity. as we will see in chapter 5, the gently curving geometrical form of
space  emerging  from  general  relativity  is  at  loggerheads  with  the  frantic,  roiling,  microscopic
behavior of the universe implied by quantum mechanics. as it was not until the mid-1980s that string
theory  offered  a  resolution,  this  conflict  is  rightly  called  the  central  problem  of  modern  physics.
moreover, building on special and general relativity, string theory requires its own severe revamping
of our conceptions of space and time. for example, most of us take for granted that our universe has
three spatial dimensions. but this is not so according to string theory, which claims that our universe
has many more dimensions than meet the eye—dimensions that are tightly curle

d into the folded fabric
of the cosmos. so central are these remarkable insights into the nature of space and time that we shall
use them as a guiding theme in all that follows. string theory, in a real sense, is the story of space and
time since einstein.

to appreciate what string theory actually is, we need to take a step back and briefly describe

what we have learned during the last century about the microscopic structure of the universe.

the universe at its smallest: what we know about matter

the  ancient  greeks  surmised  that  the  stuff  of  the  universe  was  made  up  of  tiny  "uncuttable"
ingredients that they called atoms. just as the enormous number of words in an alphabetic language is
built up from the wealth of combinations of a small number of letter

ar more quickly, having a devastating effect on the formation of life as we know it. on the other
hand,  were  the  strength  of  the  gravitational  force  significantly  decreased,  matter  would  not  clump
together at all, thereby preventing the formation of stars and galaxies.

we could go on, but the idea is clear: the universe is the way it is because the matter and the
force particles have the properties they do. but is there a scientific explanation for why they have
these properties?

string theory: the basic idea

string  theory  offers  a  powerful  conceptual  paradigm  in  which,  for  the  first  time,  a  framework  for
answering these questions has emerged. let's first get the basic idea.

the particles in table 1.1 are the "letters" of all matter. just like their linguistic counterparts,
they appear to have no further internal substructure. string theory proclaims otherwise. according to
string  theory,  if  we  could  examine  these  particles  with  even  greater  precisi

on—a  precision  many
orders  of  magnitude  beyond  our  present  technological  capacity—we  would  find  that  each  is  not
pointlike, but instead consists of a tiny one-dimensional loop. like an infinitely thin rubber band, each

particle contains a vibrating, oscillating, dancing filament that physicists, lacking gell-mann's literary
flair, have named a string. in figure 1.1 we illustrate this essential idea of string theory by starting
with  an  ordinary  piece  of  matter,  an  apple,  and  repeatedly  magnifying  its  structure  to  reveal  its
ingredients on ever smaller scales. string theory adds the new microscopic layer of a vibrating loop
to the previously known progression from atoms through protons, neutrons, electrons and quarks.2

although it is by no means obvious, we will see in chapter 6 that this simple replacement of
point-particle  material  constituents  with  strings  resolves  the  incom

patibility  between  quantum
mechanics  and  general  relativity.  string  theory  thereby  unravels  the  central  gordian  knot  of
contemporary theoretical physics. this is a tremendous achievement, but it is only part of the reason
string theory has generated such excitement.

figure  1.1  matter  is  composed  of  atoms,  which  in  turn  are  made  from  quarks  and  electrons.
according to string theory, all such particles are actually tiny loops of vibrating string.

string theory as the unified theory of everything

in  einstein's  day,  the  strong  and  the  weak  forces  had  not  yet  been  discovered,  but  he  found  the
existence of even two distinct forces—gravity and electromagnetism—deeply troubling. einstein did
not accept that nature is founded on such an extravagant design. this launched his thirty-year voyage
in search of the so-called unified field theory that he hoped would show that these two forces are
really manifestations of one grand unde

ework of quantum mechanics. he wrote to a friend in the early 1940s, "i have become a
lonely  old  chap  who  is  mainly  known  because  he  doesn't  wear  socks  and  who  is  exhibited  as  a
curiosity on special occasions."3

einstein was simply ahead of his time. more than half a century later, his dream of a unified
theory  has  become  the  holy  grail  of  modern  physics.  and  a  sizeable  part  of  the  physics  and
mathematics  community  is  becoming  increasingly  convinced  that  string  theory  may  provide  the
answer. from one principle—that everything at its most microscopic level consists of combinations
of vibrating strands—string theory provides a single explanatory framework capable of encompassing
all forces and all matter.

string theory proclaims, for instance, that the observed particle properties, the data summarized

in tables 1.1 and 1.2, are a reflection of the various ways in which a string can vibrate. just as the
strings on a violin or on a piano have r

esonant frequencies at which they prefer to vibrate—patterns
that our ears sense as various musical notes and their higher harmonics—the same holds true for the
loops of string theory. but we will see that, rather than producing musical notes, each of the preferred
patterns of vibration of a string in string theory appears as a particle whose mass and force charges
are determined by the string's oscillatory pattern. the electron is a string vibrating one way, the up-
quark is a string vibrating another way, and so on. far from being a collection of chaotic experimental
facts, particle properties in string theory are the manifestation of one and the same physical feature:
the resonant patterns of vibration—the music, so to speak—of fundamental loops of string. the same
idea applies to the forces of nature as well. we will see that force particles are also associated with
particular patterns of string vibration and hence everything, all matter and all forces, is unified un

the same rubric of microscopic string oscillations—the "notes" that strings can play.

for the first time in the history of physics we therefore have a framework with the capacity to
explain  every  fundamental  feature  upon  which  the  universe  is  constructed.  for  this  reason  string
theory is sometimes described as possibly being the "theory of everything" (t.o.e.) or the "ultimate"
or "final" theory. these grandiose descriptive terms are meant to signify the deepest possible theory
of physics—a theory that underlies all others, one that does not require or even allow for a deeper
explanatory base. in practice, many string theorists take a more down-to-earth approach and think of a

repugnant  to  claim  that  the  wonders  of  life  and  the  universe  are  mere  reflections  of  microscopic
particles engaged in a pointless dance fully choreographed by the laws of physics. is it really the case
that feelings of joy, sorrow, or boredom are nothing but chemical reactions in the brain—reactions
between molecules and atoms that, even more microscopically, are reactions between some of the
particles in table 1.1, which are really just vibrating strings? in response to this line of criticism,
nobel laureate steven weinberg cautions in dreams of a final theory,

at the other end of the spectrum are the opponents of reductionism who are appalled by
what they feel to be the bleakness of modern science. to whatever extent they and their
world  can  be  reduced  to  a  matter  of  particles  or  fields  and  their  interactions,  they  feel
diminished by that knowledge. . .. i would not try to answer these critics with a peptalk

ll the end of science. quite the contrary:
the discovery of the t.o.e.—the ultimate explanation of the universe at its most microscopic level, a
theory that does not rely on any deeper explanation—would provide the firmest foundation on which
to build  our  understanding  of  the  world.  its  discovery  would  mark  a  beginning,  not  an  end.  the
ultimate theory would provide an unshakable pillar of coherence forever assuring us that the universe
is a comprehensible place.

the state of string theory

the central concern of this book is to explain the workings of the universe according to string theory,
with a primary emphasis on the implications that these results have for our understanding of space and
time. unlike many other exposes of scientific developments, the one given here does not address itself
to a theory that has been completely worked out, confirmed by vigorous experimental tests, and fully
accepted by the scientific community. the reason for this, as we will discuss in
 
 ___________________________
 
 subsequent chapters,
is  that  string  theory  is  such  a  deep  and  sophisticated  theoretical  structure  that  even  with  the
impressive progress that has been made over the last two decades, we still have far to go before we
can claim to have achieved full mastery.

and  so  string  theory  should  be  viewed  as  a  work  in  progress  whose  partial  completion  has
already revealed astonishing insights into the nature of space, time, and matter. the harmonious union
of  general  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  is  a  major  success.  furthermore,  unlike  any  previous
theory, string theory has the capacity to answer primordial questions having to do with nature's most
fundamental constituents and forces. of equal importance, although somewhat harder to convey, is

 the
remarkable elegance of both the answers and the framework for answers that string theory proposes.
for instance, in string theory many aspects of nature that might appear to be arbitrary technical details
—such as the number of distinct fundamental particle ingredients and their respective properties—are
found to arise from essential and tangible aspects of the geometry of the universe. if string theory is
right, the microscopic fabric of our universe is a richly intertwined multidimensional labyrinth within
which the strings of the universe endlessly twist and vibrate, rhythmically beating out the laws of the
cosmos. far from being accidental details, the properties of nature's basic building blocks are deeply
entwined with the fabric of space and time.

in the final analysis, though, nothing is a substitute for definitive, testable predictions that can
determine whether string theory

has truly lifted the veil of mystery hiding the deepest truths of our

universe.  it  may  be  some  time  before  our  level  of  comprehension  has  reached  sufficient  depth  to
achieve this aim, although, as we will discuss in chapter 9, experimental tests could provide strong
circumstantial support for string theory within the next ten years or so. moreover, in chapter 13 we
will  see  that  string  theory  has  recently  solved  a  central  puzzle  concerning  black  holes,  associated
with  the  so-called  bekenstein-hawking  entropy,  that  has  stubbornly  resisted  resolution  by  more
conventional  means  for  more  than  twenty-five  years.  this  success  has  convinced  many  that  string
theory is in the process of giving us our deepest understanding of how the universe works.

edward witten, one of the pioneers and leading experts in string theory, summarizes the situation
by

saying  that  "string  theory  is  a  part  of  twenty-first-century  physics  that  fell  by  chance  into  the
twentieth century," an assessment first articulated by the celebrated italian physicist daniele amati. 5
in  a  sense,  then,  it  is  as  if  our  forebears  in  the  late  nineteenth  century  had  been  presented  with  a
modern-day supercomputer, without the operating instructions. through inventive trial and error, hints
of  the  supercomputer's  power  would  have  become  evident,  but  it  would

have  taken  vigorous  and
prolonged effort to gain true mastery. the hints of the computer's potential, like our glimpses of string
theory's explanatory power, would have provided extremely strong motivation for obtaining complete
facility. a similar motivation today energizes a generation of theoretical physicists to pursue a full
and precise analytic understanding of string theory.

witten's remark and those of other experts in the field indicate that it could be decades or even
centuries before string theory is fully developed and understood. this may well be true. in fact, the
mathematics of string theory is so complicated that, to date, no one even knows the exact equations of
the theory. instead, physicists know only approximations to these equations, and even the approximate
equations  are  so  complicated  that  they  as  yet  have  been  only  partially  so

lved.  nevertheless,  an
inspiring  set  of  breakthroughs  in  the  latter  half  of  the  1990s—breakthroughs  that  have  answered
theoretical  questions  of  hitherto  unimaginable  difficulty—may  well  indicate  that  complete
quantitative understanding of string theory is much closer than initially thought. physicists worldwide
are developing powerful new techniques to transcend the numerous approximate methods so far used,
collectively piecing together disparate elements of the string theory puzzle at an exhilarating rate.

surprisingly, these developments are providing new vantage points for reinterpreting some of
the basic aspects of the theory that have been in place for some time. for instance, a natural question
that may have occurred to you in looking at figure 1.1 is, why strings? why not little frisbee disks?
or microscopic bloblike nuggets? or a combination of all of these possibilities? as we shall see in
chapter 12, the most recent insights show that these other k

inds of ingredients do have an important
role in string theory, and have revealed that string theory is actually part of an even grander synthesis
currently (and mysteriously) named m-theory. these latest developments will be the subject of the
final chapters of this book.

progress in science proceeds in fits and starts. some periods are filled with great breakthroughs;
at other times researchers experience dry spells. scientists put forward results, both theoretical and
experimental. the results are debated by the community, sometimes they are discarded, sometimes
they  are  modified,

  and  sometimes  they  provide  inspirational  jumping-off  points  for  new  and  more
accurate ways of understanding the physical universe. in other words, science proceeds along a zig
zag  path  toward  what  we  hope  will  be  ultimate  truth,  a  path  that  began  with  humanity's  earliest
attempts  to  fathom  the  cosmos  and  whose  end  we  cannot  predict.  whether  string  theory  is  an
incidental rest stop along this path, a landmark turning point, or in fact the final destination we do not
know. but the last two decades of research by hundreds of dedicated physicists and mathematicians
from numerous countries have given us well-founded hope that we are on the right and possibly final

track.

it is a telling testament of the rich and far-reaching nature of string theory that even our present
level of understanding has allowed us to gain striking new insights

 into the workings of the universe.
a central thread in what follows will be those developments that carry forward the revolution in our
understanding of space and time initiated by einstein's special and general theories of relativity. we
will see that if string theory is correct, the fabric of our universe has properties that would likely have
dazzled even einstein.

space, time, and the eye of the beholder

in june 1905, twenty-six-year-old albert einstein submitted a technical article to the german annals
of  physics  in  which  he  came  to  grips  with  a  paradox  about  light  that  had  first  troubled  him  as  a
teenager, some ten years earlier. upon turning the final page of e

per second your arm goes through and is consequently fairly low. but to generate short wavelengths
you  shake  your  end  more  frantically—more  frequently,  so  to  speak—and  this  yields  a  higher-
frequency wave. finally, physicists use the term amplitude to describe the maximum height or depth
of a wave, as also illustrated in figure 4.2.

in case you find electromagnetic waves a bit abstract, another good analogy to keep in mind are
the waves that are produced by plucking a violin string. different wave frequencies correspond to
different musical notes: the higher the frequency, the higher the note. the amplitude of a wave on a
violin string is determined by how hard you pluck it. a harder pluck means that you put more energy
into the wave disturbance; more energy therefore corresponds to a larger amplitude. you can hear
this, as the resulting tone is louder. similarly, less energy corresponds to a smaller amplitude and a

energy it can have. planck found that this proportionality factor—now known as planck's  constant
and  denoted h  (pronounced  "h-bar")—is  about  a  billionth  of  a  billionth  of  a  billionth  in  everyday
units.4 the tiny value of planck's constant means that the size of the energy lumps are typically very
small. this is why, for example, it seems to us that we can cause the energy of a wave on a violin
string—and hence the volume of sound it produces—to change continuously. in reality, though, the
energy of the wave passes through discrete steps, a la planck, but the size of the steps is so small that
the discrete jumps from one volume to another appear to be smooth. according to planck's assertion,
the size of these jumps in energy grows as the frequency of the waves gets higher and higher (while
wavelengths get shorter and shorter). this is the crucial ingredient that resolves the infinite-ene

t, at rock bottom,
our  deepest  theoretical  understanding  of  the  universe  will  be  composed  of  a  mathematically
inconsistent patchwork of two powerful yet conflicting explanatory frameworks.

physicists  have  made  numerous  attempts  at  modifying  either  general  relativity  or  quantum
mechanics  in  some  manner  so  as  to  avoid  the  conflict,  but  the  attempts,  although  often  bold  and
ingenious, have met with failure after failure.

that is, until the discovery of superstring theory.8

nothing but music: the essentials of superstring theory

music has long since provided the metaphors of choice for those puzzling over questions of cosmic
concern. from the ancient pythagorean "music of the spheres" to the "harmonies of nature" that have
guided  inquiry  through  the  ages,  we  have  collectively  sought  the  song  of  nature  in  the  gentle
wanderings  of  celestial  bodies  and  the  riotous  fulminations  of  subatomic

  particles.  with  the
discovery of superstring theory, musical metaphors take on a startling reality, for the theory suggests
that the microscopic landscape is suffused with tiny strings whose vibrational patterns orchestrate the
evolution  of  the  cosmos.  the  winds  of  change,  according  to  superstring  theory,  gust  through  an
aeolian universe.

by contrast, the standard model views the elementary constituents of the universe as pointlike
ingredients  with  no  internal  structure.  as  powerful  as  this  approach  is  (as  we  have  mentioned,
essentially  every  prediction  about  the  microworld  made  by  the  standard  model  has  been  verified
down to about a billionth of a billionth of a meter, the present-day technological limit), the standard

into its quantum-mechanical framework have failed due to the violent fluctuations
in  the  spatial  fabric  that  appear  at  ultramicroscopic  distances—that  is,  distances  shorter  than  the
planck  length.  the  unresolved  conflict  has  impelled  a  search  for  an  even  deeper  understanding  of
nature. in 1984, the physicists michael green, then of queen mary college, and john schwarz of the
california institute of technology provided the first piece of convincing evidence that superstring
theory (or string theory, for short) might well provide this understanding.

string  theory  offers  a  novel  and  profound  modification  to  our  theoretical  description  of  the
ultramicroscopic properties of the universe—a modification that, physicists slowly realized, alters
einstein's general relativity in just the right way to make it fully compatible with the laws of quantum
mechanics.  according  to  string  theory,  the  elementary  ingredients  of  the  universe  are not  point

articles. rather, they are tiny, one-dimensional filaments somewhat like infinitely thin rubber bands,
vibrating to and fro. but don't let the name fool you: unlike an ordinary piece of string, which is itself
composed of molecules and atoms, the strings of string theory are purported to lie deep within the
heart  of  matter.  the  theory  proposes  that they  are  ultramicroscopic  ingredients  making  up  the
particles  out  of  which  atoms  themselves  are  made.  the  strings  of  string  theory  are  so  small—on
average they are about as long as the planck length—that they appear pointlike even when examined
with our most powerful equipment.

yet  the  simple  replacement  of  point  particles  with  strands  of  string  as  the  fundamental
ingredients of everything has far-reaching consequences. first and foremost, string theory appears to
resolve the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics. as we shall see, the spatially
extended nature of a string is

 the crucial new element allowing for a single harmonious framework
incorporating both theories. second, string theory provides a truly unified theory, since all matter and
all forces are proposed to arise from one basic ingredient: oscillating strings. finally, as discussed

radically changes our understanding of spacetime.1

a brief history of string theory

in  1968,  a  young  theoretical  physicist  named  gabriele  veneziano  was  struggling  to  make  sense  of
various experimentally observed properties of the strong nuclear force. veneziano, then a research
fellow at cern, the european accelerator laboratory in geneva, switzerland, had worked on aspects
of this problem for a number of years, until one day he came upon a striking revelation. much to his
surprise,  he  realized  that  an  esoteric  formula  concocted  for  purely  mathe

ing or justification,
euler's  beta-function  seemed  to  work,  but  no  one  knew  why.  it  was  a  formula  in  search  of  an
explanation. this changed in 1970 when the works of yoichiro nambu of the university of chicago,
holger nielsen of the niels bohr institute, and leonard susskind of stanford university revealed the
hitherto-unknown  physics  lurking  behind  euler's  formula.  these  physicists  showed  that  if  one
modeled elementary particles as little, vibrating, one-dimensional strings, their nuclear interactions
could  be  described  exactly  by  euler's  function.  if  the  pieces  of  string  were  small  enough,  they
reasoned, they would still look like point particles, and hence could be consistent with experimental
observations.

although  this  provided  an  intuitively  simple  and  pleasing  theory,  it  was  not  long  before  the
string  description  of  the  strong  force  was  shown  to  fail.  during  the  early  1970s,  high-energy
experiments capable of prob

ing the subatomic world more deeply showed that the string model made
a number of predictions that were in direct conflict with observations. at the same time, the point-
particle  quantum  field  theory  of  quantum  chromodynamics  was  being  developed,  and  its
overwhelming success in describing the strong force led to the dismissal of string theory.

most particle physicists thought that string theory had been relegated to the dustbin of science,
but a few dedicated researchers kept at it. schwarz, for instance, felt that "the mathematical structure
of string theory was so beautiful and had so many miraculous properties that it had to be pointing
toward something deep."2 one of the problems physicists found with string theory was that it seemed
to have a true embarrassment of riches. the theory contained configurations of vibrating string that
had properties akin to those of gluons, s

ubstantiating its early claim of being a theory of the strong
force. but beyond these it contained additional messenger-like particles that did not appear to have
any relevance to experimental observations of the strong force. in 1974, schwarz and joël scherk of
the  ecole  normale  superieure  made  a  bold  leap  that  transformed  this  apparent  vice  into  a  virtue.
after  studying  the  puzzling  messenger-like  patterns  of  string  vibration,  they  realized  that  their
properties matched perfectly those of the hypothesized messenger particle of the gravitational force—
the  graviton. although  these  "smallest  bundles"  of  the  gravitational  force  have,  as  yet,  never  been
seen, theorists can confidently predict certain basic features that they must possess, and scherk and

schwarz found these properties to be realized exactly by certain vibrational patterns. based on this,
scherk and schwarz suggested that s

tring theory had failed in its initial attempt because physicists had
unduly constrained its scope. string theory is not just a theory of the strong force, they proclaimed; it
is a quantum theory that includes gravity as well.3

the  physics  community  did  not  receive  this  suggestion  with  unbridled  enthusiasm.  in  fact,
schwarz recounts that "our work was universally ignored."4 the path of progress was already littered
with numerous failed attempts to unite gravity and quantum mechanics. string theory had been shown
wrong in its initial effort to describe the strong force, and it seemed to

many that it was senseless to
try to use the theory to pursue an even grander goal. even more devastating, subsequent studies during
the late 1970s and early 1980s showed that string theory and quantum mechanics suffered from their
own subtle conflicts. it appeared that the gravitational force had, once again, resisted incorporation
into the microscopic description of the universe.

such  was  the  case  until  1984.  in  a  landmark  paper  culminating  more  than  a  dozen  years  of
intense research that had been largely ignored and often outright dismissed by most physicists, green
and schwarz established that the subtle quantum conflict afflicting string theory could b

later  the  mood  had  swung  completely  around.  the  success  of  green  and  schwarz  finally  trickled
down  even  to  first-year  graduate  students,  and  an  electrifying  sense  of  being  on  the  inside  of  a
profound moment in the history of physics displaced the previous ennui. a number of us consistently
worked  deep  into  the  night  to  try  to  master  the  vast  areas  of  theoretical  physics  and  abstract
mathematics that are required to understand string theory.

the period from 1984 to 1986 has come to be known as the "first superstring revolution." during
those three years more than a thousand research papers on string theory were written by physicists
from  around  the  world.  these  works  showed  conclusively  that  numerous  features  of  the  standard
model—features  that  had  been  painstakingly  discovered  over  the  course  of  decades  of  research
—emerged naturally  and  simply  from  the  grand  structure  of  string  theor

y. as  michael  green  has
said, "the moment you encounter string theory and realize that almost all of the major developments
in physics over the last hundred years emerge—and emerge with such elegance—from such a simple
starting point, you realize that this incredibly compelling theory is in a class of its own."5 moreover,
for many of these features, as we shall discuss, string theory offers a far fuller and more satisfying
explanation than is found in the standard model. these developments convinced many physicists that
string theory was well on its way to fulfilling its promise of being the ultimate unified theory.

nonetheless, over and over again string theorists encountered a significant stumbling block. in
theoretical  physics  research,  one  is  frequently  confronted  with  equations  that  are  just  too  hard  to
understand  or  to  analyze.  typically,  p

hysicists  don't  give  up,  but  try  to  solve  the  equations
approximately. the situation in string theory is even more difficult. even determining the equations
themselves  has  proved  to  be  so  difficult  that  only  approximate  versions  of  them  have  so  far  been
deduced. string theorists have thereby been limited to finding approximate solutions to approximate
equations. after the few years of dramatic progress during the first superstring revolution, physicists
found that the approximations being used were inadequate to answer a number of essential questions
hindering  further  developments.  with  no  concrete  proposals  for  going  beyond  the  approximate
methods, many physicists working on string theory grew frustrated and returned to their previous lines
of research. for those who remained, the late 1980s and early 1990s were trying times. like a golden

promise of string theory beckoned, but no one had the key to unlock its power. long dry spells were
periodically punctuated by important discoveries, but it was clear to everyone in the field that new
methods with the power to go beyond the previous approximations were required.

then, in a breathtaking lecture at the strings 1995 conference held at the university of southern
california—a lecture that stunned a packed audience of the world's top physicists—edward witten
announced a plan for taking the next step, thereby igniting the "second superstring revolution." string
theorists, as of this writing, are working vigorously to sharpen a set of new methods that promise to
overcome  the  theoretical  obstacles  previously  encountered.  the  difficulties  that  lie  ahead  will

of the world's superstring theorists, but the light at the end of the
tunnel, although still distant, may finally be becoming visible.

in this chapter and a number that follow, we shall describe the understanding of string theory that
emerged  from  the  first  superstring  revolution  and  subsequent  work  prior  to  the  second  superstring
revolution. from time to time we will indicate new insights stemming from the latter; our discussion
of these most recent advances will come in chapters 12 and 13.

the greeks' atoms, again?

as we mentioned at the outset of this chapter and as illustrated in figure 1.1, string theory claims that
if  the  presumed  point-particles  of  the  standard  model  could  be  examined  with  a  precision
significantly beyond our present capacity, each would be seen to be made of a single, tiny, oscilla

loop of string.

for reasons that will become clear, the length of a typical string loop is about the planck length,
about a hundred billion billion (1020) times smaller than an atomic nucleus. it is no wonder that our
present-day experiments are unable to resolve the microscopic stringy nature of matter: strings are
minute even on the scales set by subatomic particles. we would need an accelerator to slam matter
together with energies some million billion times more powerful than any previously constructed in
order to reveal directly that a string is not a point-particle.

we will describe shortly the stunning implications that follow from replacing point-particles by

strings, but let's first address a more basic question: what are strings made of?

there are two possible answers to this question. fi
 
 ___________________________
 
rst, strings are truly fundamental—they are
"atoms," uncuttable constituents, in the truest sense of the ancient greeks. as the absolute smallest
constituents  of  anything  and  everything,  they  represent  the  end  of  the  line—the  last  of  the  russian

matrioshka  dolls—in  the  numerous  layers  of  substructure  in  the  microscopic  world.  from  this
perspective, even though strings have spatial extent, the question of their composition is without any
content.  were  strings  to  be  made  of  something  smaller  they  would  not  be  fundamental.  instead,
whatever strings were composed of would immediately displace them and lay claim to being an even
more  basic  constituent  of  the  universe.  using  our  linguistic  analogy,  paragraphs  are  made  of
sentences, sentences are made of words, and words are made of letters. what makes up a letter? from
a linguistic standpoint, that's the end of the line. letters are letters—they are the fundamental building
bl
 
 ___________________________
 
ocks  of  written  language;  there  is  no  further  substructure.  questioning  their  composition  has  no
meaning.  similarly,  a  string  is  simply  a  string—as  there  is  nothing  more  fundamental,  it  can't  be
described as being composed of any other substance.

that's the first answer. the second answer is based on the simple fact that as yet we do not
know if string theory is a correct or final theory of nature. if string theory is truly off the mark, then,
well,  we  can  forget  strings  and  the  irrelevant  question  of  their  composition.  although  this  is  a
possibility, research since the mid-1980s overwhelmingly points toward its being extremely unlikely.
but history surely has taught us that every time our understanding of the universe deepens, we find yet
smaller  microscopic  ingredients  constituting  a  finer  level  of  matter.  and  so  another  possibility,
should strings fail to be the final 
 
 ___________________________
 
theory, is that they are one more layer in the cosmic onion, a layer
that becomes visible at the planck length, although not the final layer. in this case, strings could be
made up of yet-smaller structures. string theorists have raised and continue to pursue this possibility.
to date there are intriguing hints in theoretical studies that strings may have further substructure, but
there is as yet no definitive evidence. only time and intense research will supply the final word on
this question.

aside  from  a  few  speculations  in  chapters  12  and  15,  for  our  discussion  here  we  approach
strings in the manner proposed in the first answer—that is, we will take strings to be nature's most
fundamental ingredient.

unification through string theory

besides  its  inability  to  incorporate  the  gravitational  force,  the  stan

  fact,  had  experiments  revealed  a  somewhat  different  particle  content  in  the  microscopic
world,  possibly  interacting  with  somewhat  different  forces,  these  changes  could  have  been  fairly
easily incorporated in the standard model by providing the theory with different input parameters. the
structure of the standard model, in this sense, is too flexible to be able to explain the properties of the
elementary particles, as it could have accommodated a range of possibilities.

string theory is dramatically different. it is a unique and inflexible theoretical edifice. it requires
no input beyond a single number, described below, that sets the benchmark scale for measurements.
all properties of the microworld are within the realm of its explanatory power. to understand this,
let's first think about more familiar strings, such as those on a violin. each such string can undergo a
huge variety (in fact, infinite in number) of different vibrational patterns known as resonances, s

uch
as those shown in figure 6.1. these are the wave patterns whose peaks and troughs are evenly spaced
and  fit  perfectly  between  the  string's  two  fixed  endpoints.  our  ears  sense  these  different  resonant
vibrational patterns as different musical notes. the strings in string theory have similar properties.
there are resonant vibrational patterns that the string can support by virtue of their evenly spaced
peaks  and  troughs  exactly  fitting  along  its  spatial  extent.  some  examples  are  given  in  figure  6.2.
here's the central fact: just as the different vibrational patterns of a violin string give rise to different
musical  notes, the  different  vibrational  patterns  of  a  fundamental  string  give  rise  to  different
masses and force charges. as this is a crucial point, let's say it again. according to string theory, the
properties of a
 
 ___________________________
 
n elementary "particle"—its mass and its various force charges—are determined by the
precise resonant pattern of vibration that its internal string executes.

figure 6.1 strings on a violin can vibrate in resonant patterns in which a whole number of peaks and
troughs exactly fit between the two ends.

it's  easiest  to  understand  this  association  for  a  particle's  mass.  the  energy  of  a  particular
vibrational string pattern depends on its amplitude—the maximum displacement between peaks and
troughs—and  its  wavelength—the  separation  between  one  peak  and  the  next.  the  greater  the
amplitude and the shorter the wavelength, the greater the energy. this reflects what you would expect
intuitively—more  frantic  vibrational  patterns  have  more  energy,  while  less  frantic  ones  have  less
energy. we give a couple of examples in figure 6.3. this is again familiar, as violin strings that are

plucked more vigorously will vibrate more wildly, while those plucked more gingerly will vibrate
more gently. now, from special relativity we know that energy and mass are two sides of the same
coin: greater energy means greater mass, and vice versa. thus, according to string theory, the mass of
an  elementary  particle  is  determined  by  the energy  of  the  vibrational  pattern  of  its  internal  string.

heavier particles have internal strings that vibrate more energetically, while lighter particles have
internal strings that vibrate less energetically.

figure 6.2 the loops in string theory can vibrate in resonance patterns—similar to those of violin
strings—in which a whole number of peaks and troughs fit along their spatial extent.

since the mass of a particle determines its gravitational properties, we see that there is a direct
association between the pattern of string vibration and a particle's response to the gravitation

al force.
although  the  reasoning  involved  is  somewhat  more  abstract,  physicists  have  found  that  a  similar
alignment exists between other detailed aspects of a string's pattern of vibration and its properties vis
a vis other forces. the electric charge, the weak charge, and the strong charge carried by a particular
string, for instance, are determined by the precise way it vibrates. moreover, exactly the same idea
holds for the messenger particles themselves. particles like photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons
are yet other resonant patterns of string vibration. and of particular importance, among the vibrational
string patterns, one matches perfectly the properties of the graviton, ensuring that gravity is an integral
part of string theory.7

so we see that, according to string theory, the observed properties
 
 ___________________________
 
 of each elementary particle
arise because its internal string undergoes a particular resonant vibrational pattern. this perspective
differs sharply from that espoused by physicists before the discovery of string theory; in the earlier
perspective the differences among the fundamental particles were explained by saying that, in effect,
each  particle  species  was  "cut  from  a  different  fabric."  although  each  particle  was  viewed  as
elementary,  the  kind  of  "stuff"  each  embodied  was  thought  to  be  different.  electron  "stuff,"  for
example,  had  negative  electric  charge,  while  neutrino  "stuff"  had  no  electric  charge.  string  theory
alters this picture radically by declaring
 
 ___________________________
 
 that the "stuff" of all matter and all forces is the same. each
elementary particle is composed of a single string—that is, each particle is a single string—and all
strings  are  absolutely  identical.  differences  between  the  particles  arise  because  their  respective
strings  undergo  different  resonant  vibrational  patterns.  what  appear  to  be  different  elementary
particles are actually different "notes" on a fundamental string. the universe—being composed of an
enormous number of these vibrating strings—is akin to a cosmic symphony.

figure 6.3 more frantic vibrational patterns have more energy than less frantic ones.

this  overview  shows  how  string  theory  offers  a  truly  wonderful  unifying  framework.  every

particle of matter and every transmitter of force consists of a string whose pattern of vibration is its
"fingerprint."  because  every  physical  event,  process,  or  occurrence  in  the  univer

se  is,  at  its  most
elementary  level,  describable  in  terms  of  forces  acting  between  these  elementary  material
constituents, string theory provides the promise of a single, all-inclusive, unified description of the
physical universe: a theory of everything (t.o.e.).

the music of string theory

even though string theory does away with the previous concept of structureless elementary particles,
old language dies hard, especially when it provides an accurate description of reality down to the
most  minute  of  distance  scales.  following  the  common  practice  of  the  field  we  shall  therefore
continue to refer to "elementary particles," yet we will always mean "what appear to be elementary
particles but are actually tiny pieces of vibrating string." in the preceding section we proposed that
the mass
 
 ___________________________
 
es and the force charges of such elementary particles are the result of the way in which their
respective  strings  are  vibrating.  this  leads  us  to  the  following  realization:  if  we  can  work  out
precisely the allowed resonant vibrational patterns of fundamental strings—the "notes," so to speak,
that they can play—we should be able to explain the observed properties of the elementary particles.
for the first time, therefore, string theory sets up a framework for explaining the properties of the
particles observed in nature.

at  this  stage,  then,  we  should  "grab  hold"  of  a  string  and  "pluck"  it  in  all  sorts  of  ways  to
determine the possible resonant patterns of vibration. if string theory is right, we should find that the
possible patterns yield exactly the observed properties of the matter and force particles in tables 1.1
and 1.2. of course, a string is too small to carry out this experiment literally

as described. rather, by
using mathematical descriptions we can theoretically pluck a string. in the mid-1980s, many string
adherents believed that the mathematical analysis required for doing this was on the verge of being
able  to  explain  every  detailed  property  of  the  universe  on  its  most  microscopic  level.  some
enthusiastic physicists declared that the t.o.e. had finally been discovered. more than a decade of
hindsight has shown that the euphoria generated by this belief was premature. string theory has the
makings of a t.o.e., but a number of hurdles remain, preventing us from deducing the spectrum
 
 ___________________________
 
 of
string vibrations with the precision necessary to compare with experimental results. at the present
time,  therefore,  we  do  not  know  if  the  fundamental  characteristics  of  our  universe,  summarized  in
tables 1.1 and 1.2, can be explained by string theory. as we will discuss in chapter 9, under certain
assumptions that we will clearly state, string theory can give rise to a universe with properties that
are in qualitative agreement with the known particle and force data, but extracting detailed numerical
predictions from the theory is currently beyond our abilities. and so, although the framework of string
theory, unlike that of the point-particle standard model, is capable of giving an explanation for why
the particles and forces have the properties they do, we have not, as yet, been able to extract it. but
remarkably, string theory is s
 
 ___________________________
 
o rich and far-reaching that, even though we cannot yet determine its
most detailed properties, we are able to gain insight into a wealth of the new physical phenomena that
follow from the theory, as we will see in subsequent chapters.

in the following chapters we shall also discuss the status of the hurdles in some detail, but it is
instructive first to understand them at a general level. strings in the world around us come with a
variety  of  tensions.  the  string  laced  through  a  pair  of  shoes,  for  example,  is  usually  quite  slack
compared to the string stretched from one end of a violin to another. both of these, in turn, are under

far less tension than the steel strings of a piano. the one number that string theory requires in order to
set its overall scale is the corresponding tension on its loops. how is this tension determined? well,
if we could pluck a fundamental string we would learn about its stiffness, and in this way we could
meas
 
 ___________________________
 
ure its tension much as is done to measure the tension of more familiar everyday strings. but
since fundamental strings are so tiny, this approach cannot be carried out and a more indirect method
is  called  for.  in  1974,  when  scherk  and  schwarz  proposed  that  one  particular  pattern  of  string
vibration was the graviton particle, they were able to exploit such an indirect approach and thereby
predict the tension on the strings of string theory. their calculations revealed that the strength of the
force transmitted by the proposed graviton pattern of string vibration is inversely proportional to the
string's tension. and since the graviton is supposed to transmit the gravitational force—a force that is
intrinsically quite feeble—they found that this implies a colossal tension of a thousand billion billion
billion billion (1039) tons, the so-called planck tension. fundamental strings are therefore extremely
stiff compared wi
 
 ___________________________
 
th more familiar examples. this has three important consequences.

three consequences of stiff strings

first, whereas the ends of a violin or a piano string are pinned down, ensuring that they have a fixed
length, no analogous constraining frame pins down the size of a fundamental string. instead, the huge
string tension causes the loops of string theory to contract to a minuscule size. detailed calculation
reveals that being under planck tension translates into a typical string having planck length—10-33
centimeters—as previously mentioned.8

second, because of the enormous tension, the typical energy of a vibrating loop in string theory
is extremely high. to understand this, we note that the greater the tension a string is under, the harder
it is to get it to vibrate. for instance, it's far easier to pluck a violin string and set it vibrating than it is
to pluck a piano string. two strings, therefore, that are under different tension and are vibrating in
precisel

y the same way will not have the same energy. the string with higher tension will have more
energy than the string with lower tension, since more energy must be exerted to set it in motion.

this alerts us to the fact that the energy of a vibrating string is determined by two things: the
precise manner in which it vibrates (more frantic patterns corresponding to higher energies) and the
tension of the string (higher tension corresponding to higher energy). at first, this description might
lead  you  to  think  that  by  taking  on  ever  gentler  vibrational  patterns—patterns  with  ever  smaller
amplitudes and fewer peaks and troughs—a string can embody less and less energy. but as we found
in chapter 4 in a different context, quantum mechanics tells us that this reasoning is not right. like all
vibrations or wavelike disturbances, quantum mechanics implies that they can exist only in discret

e
units. roughly speaking, just as the money carried by a comrade in the warehouse is a whole number
multiple of the monetary denomination with which he or she is entrusted, the energy embodied in a
string vibrational pattern is a whole number multiple of a minimal energy denomination. in particular,
this  minimal  energy  denomination  is  proportional  to  the  tension  of  the  string  (and  it  is  also
proportional to the number of peaks and troughs in the particular vibrational pattern), while the whole
number multiple is determined by the amplitude of the vibrational pattern.

the  key  point  for  the  present  discussion  is  this:  since  the  minimal  energy  denominations  are
proportional  to  the  string's  tension,  and  since  this  tension  is  enormous,  the  fundamental  minimal
energies are, on the usual scales of elementary particle physics, similarly huge.

he planck energy. to get a sense of scale, if we translate the planck energy into a

mass using einstein's famous conversion formula e = mc2, they correspond to masses that are on the
order  of  ten  billion  billion  (1019)  times  that  of  a  proton.  this  gargantuan  mass—by  elementary
particle standards—is known as the planck mass; it's about equal to the mass of a grain of dust or a
collection of a million average bacteria. and so, the typical mass-equivalent of a vibrating loop in
string theory is generally some whole number (1, 2, 3,. . .) times the planck mass. physicists often
express this by saying that the "natural" or "typical" energy scale (and hence mass scale) of string
theory is the planck scale.

this raises a crucial question directly related to the goal of reproducing the particle properties
in tables 1.1 and 1.2: if the "natural" energy scale of string theory is some ten billion billion times
that of a proton, how can it possibly account for the far-lighter partic

the answer, once again, comes from quantum mechanics. the uncertainty principle ensures that
nothing is ever perfectly at rest. all objects undergo quantum jitter, for if they didn't we would know
where  they  were  and  how  fast  they  were  moving  with  complete  precision,  in  violation  of
heisenberg's dictum. this holds true for the loops in string theory as well; no matter how placid a
string appears it will always experience some amount of quantum vibration. the remarkable thing, as
originally worked out in the 1970s, is that there can be energy cancellations between these quantum
jitters and the more intuitive kind of string vibrations discussed above and illustrated in figures 6.2
and  6.3.  in  effect,  through  the  weirdness  of  quantum  mechanics,  the  energy  associated  with  the
quantum jitters of a string is negative, and this reduces the overall energy content of a vib

rating string
by an amount that is roughly equal to planck energy. this means that the lowest-energy vibrational
string patterns, whose energies we would naively expect to be about equal to the planck energy(i.e., 1
times the planck energy), are largely canceled, thereby yielding relatively low net-energy vibrations
—energies whose corresponding mass-equivalents are in the neighborhood of the matter and force
particle masses shown in tables 1.1 and 1.2. it is these lowest energy vibrational patterns, therefore,
that  should  provide  contact  between  the  theoretical  description  of  strings  and  the  exper

  whose  properties  make  it  a  candidate  for  the  graviton  messenger  particle,  the
energy  cancellations  are perfect,  resulting  in  a  zero-mass  gravitational-force  particle.  this  is
precisely what is expected for the graviton; the gravitational force is transmitted at light speed and
only massless particles travel at this maximal velocity. but low-energy vibrational combinations are
very  much  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule.  the  more  typical  vibrating  fundamental  string
corresponds to a particle whose mass is billions upon billions times greater than that of the proton.

this  tells  us  that  the  comparatively  light  fundamental  particles  of  tables  1.1  and  1.2  should
arise, in a sense, from the fine mist above the roaring ocean of energetic strings. even a particle as
heavy as the top quark, with a mass about 189 times that of the proton, can arise from a vibrating
string  only  if  the  string's  enormous  characteristic  planck-scale  energy  is  c

coming up with such an enormous yet precise expenditure, without being privy to the exact prices of
the  individual  items,  would  severely  tax  the  acumen  of  even  the  world's  most  expert  shoppers.  in
string  theory,  where  the  currency  is  energy  as  opposed  to  money,  approximate  calculations  have
conclusively shown that analogous energy cancellations certainly can occur, but for reasons that will
become increasingly clear in subsequent chapters, verifying the cancellations to such a high level of

precision is generally beyond our theoretical ken at present. even so, as indicated before, we shall
see that many other properties of string theory that are less sensitive to these finest of

this takes us to the third consequence of the enormous value of the string tension. strings can
execute an infinite number of different vibrational patterns. for instance, in figure 6.2 we showed the
beginnings of a never-ending sequence of possibilities characterized by an ever greater number of
peaks  and  troughs.  doesn't  this  mean  that  there  would  have  to  be  a  corresponding  never-ending
sequence of elementary particles, seemingly in conflict with the experimental situation summarized in
tables 1.1 and 1.2?

the answer is yes: if string theory is right, each of the inf

string tension ensures that all but a few of these vibrational patterns will correspond to extremely
heavy particles (the few being the lowest-energy vibrations that have near-perfect cancellations with
quantum string jitters). and again, the term "heavy" here means many times heavier than the planck
mass. as our most powerful particle accelerators can reach energies only on the order of a thousand
times the proton mass, less than a millionth of a billionth of the planck energy, we are very far from
being able to search in the laboratory for any of these new particles predicted by string theory.

there are more indirect approaches by which we could search for them, though. for instance,

particles copiously. in general one would not expect them to survive to the present day, as such super-
heavy particles are usually unstable, relinquishing their enormous mass by decaying into a cascade of
ever  lighter  particles,  ending  with  the  familiar,  relatively  light  particles  in  the  world  around  us.
however, it is possible that such a super-heavy vibrational string state—a relic from the big bang—
did survive to the present. finding such particles, as we discuss more fully in chapter 9, would be a
monumental discovery, to say the least.

gravity and quantum mechanics in string theory

the unified framework that string theory presents is compelling. but its real attraction is the ability to
ameliorate  the  hostilities  between  the  gravitational  force  and  quantum  mechanics.  recall  that  the
problem in merging general relativity and quantum mech

  smoothly  curving  geometrical  structure—confronts  the
essential feature of the latter—that everything in the universe, including the fabric of space and time,
undergoes  quantum  fluctuations  that  become  increasingly  turbulent  when  probed  on  smaller  and
smaller distance scales. on sub-planck-scale distances, the quantum undulations are so violent that
they  destroy  the  notion  of  a  smoothly  curving  geometrical  space;  this  means  that  general  relativity
breaks down.

string  theory  softens  the  violent  quantum  undulations  by  "smearing"  out  the  short-distance
properties of space. there is a rough and a more precise answer to the question of what this really
means and how it resolves the conflict. we discuss each in turn.

the rough answer

although  it  sounds  unsophisticated,  one  way  that  we  learn  about  the  structure  of  an  object  is  by
hurling other things at it and observing the precise way in which they are deflected. we are able to

oportional to its momentum, which, roughly speaking, is its energy. and so,
by increasing a point particle's energy, its quantum wavelength can be made shorter and shorter—
quantum smearing can be decreased further and further—and hence we can use it to probe ever finer
physical  structures.  intuitively,  higher-energy  particles  have  greater  penetrating  power  and  are
therefore able to probe more minute features.

in this regard, the distinction between point particles and strands of string becomes manifest.
just as was the case for plastic pellets probing the surface features of a peach pit, the string's inherent
spatial extent prevents it from probing the structure of anything substantially smaller than its own size
—in  this  case  structures  arising  on  length  scales  shorter  than  the  planck  length.  somewhat  more

lly increasing the energy of a string does not
continually increase its ability to probe finer structures, in direct contrast with what happens for a
point particle. they found that when the energy of a string is increased, it is at first able to probe
shorter-scale structures, just like an energetic point particle. but when its energy is increased beyond
the value required for probing structures on the scale of the planck length, the additional energy does
not sharpen the string probe. rather, the energy causes the string to grow in size, thereby diminishing
its short-distance sensitivity. in fact, although the size of a typical string is the planck length, if we
pumped enough energy into a string—an amount of energy beyond our wildest imaginings but one that
would likely have been attained by the big bang—we could cause it to grow to a macroscopic size, a
clumsy probe of the microcosmos indeed! it's as if a string, unlike a point particle, has two sources of

ing: quantum jitters, as for a point particle, and also its own inherent spatial extent. increasing a
string's energy decreases the smearing from the first source but ultimately increases the smearing from
the second. the upshot is that no matter how hard you try, the extended nature of a string prevents you
from using it to probe phenomena on sub-planck-length distances.

but the whole conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics arises from the sub-
planck-length properties of the spatial fabric. if the elementary constituent of the universe cannot
probe sub-planck-scale distances, then neither it nor anything made from it can be affected by the

supposedly disastrous short-distance quantum undulations. this is similar to what happens as we
draw our hand across a highly

 polished granite surface. although at a microscopic level the granite is
discrete,  grainy,  and  bumpy,  our  fingers  are  unable  to  detect  these  short-scale  variations  and  the
surface  feels  perfectly  smooth.  our  stumpy,  extended  fingers  "smear"  out  the  microscopic
discreteness.  similarly,  since  the  string  has  spatial  extent,  it  also  has  limits  on  its  short-distance
sensitivity. it cannot detect variations on sub-planck-distance scales. like our fingers on granite, the
string  smears  out  the  jittery  ultramicroscopic  fluctuations  of  the  gravitational  field.  although  the
resulting  fluctuations  are  still  substantial,  this  smearing  smooths  them  out  just  enough  to  cure  the
incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics. and, in particular, the perni

infinities (discussed in the preceding chapter) that arise in the point-particle approach to forming a
quantum theory of gravity are done away with by string theory.

an essential difference between the granite analogy and our real concern with the spatial fabric
is that there are ways in which the microscopic discreteness of the granite's surface can be exposed:
finer, more precise probes than our fingers can be used. an electron microscope has the ability to
resolve surface features to less than a millionth of a centimeter; this is sufficiently small to reveal the
numerous  surface  imperfections.  by  contrast,  in  string  theory  there  is  no

 way  to  expose  the  sub-
planck-scale  "imperfections"  in  the  fabric  of  space.  in  a  universe  governed  by  the  laws  of  string
theory, the conventional notion that we can always dissect nature on ever smaller distances, without
limit, is not true. there is a limit, and it comes into play before we encounter the devastating quantum
foam of figure 5.1. therefore, in a sense that will be made more precise in later chapters, one can
even say that the supposed tempestuous sub-planckian quantum undulations do not exist. a positivist

ed. since
the string is supposed to be the most elementary object in the universe and since it is too large to be
affected by the violent sub-planck-length undulations of the spatial fabric, these fluctuations cannot be
measured and hence, according to string theory, do not actually arise.

a sleight of hand?

this discussion may leave you feeling dissatisfied. instead of showing that string theory tames the
sub-planck-length quantum undulations of space, we seem to have used the string's nonzero size to
skirt the whole issue completely. have we actually solved anything? we have. the following two
points will serve to emphasize this.

first, what the preceding argument implies is that the supposedly problematic sub-planck-length
spatial fluctuations are an artifact of formulating general relativity and quantum mechanics in a point-
particle framework. in a sense, therefore, the central conflict of contemporary theoretical physics has
been a problem of our own making. because w

e previously envisioned all matter particles and all
force particles to be pointlike objects with literally no spatial extent, we were obligated to consider
properties of the universe on arbitrarily short distance scales. and on the tiniest of distances we ran
into seemingly insurmountable problems. string theory tells us that we encountered these problems
only because we did not understand the true rules of the game; the new rules tell us that there is a limit
to how finely we can probe the universe—and, in a real sense, a limit to how finely our conventional
notion of distance can even be applied to the ultramicroscopic structure of the cosmos. the supposed
pernicious spatial fluctuations are now seen to have arisen in our theories because we were unaware

information. from a variety of perspectives, their research showed time and again that one or both of
these  principles  were  violated  when  the  point-particle  paradigm  was  discarded.  for  a  long  time,
therefore,  it  seemed  impossible  to  find  a  sensible  quantum  theory  based  on  anything  but  point
particles.  the  truly  impressive  feature  of  string  theory  is  that  more  than  twenty  years  of  exacting
research has shown that although certain features are unfamiliar, string theory does respect all of the
requisite properties inherent in any sensible physical theory. and furthermore, through its graviton
pattern of vibration, string theory is a quantum theory containing gravity.

theories failed. and so, if you lik

our  discussion.  but  having  developed  the  essential  ideas  of  special  relativity  in  chapter  2,  we
already have the necessary tools for describing more accurately how string theory calms the violent
quantum jitters.

in the more precise answer, we rely upon the same core idea as in the rough answer, but we
express it directly at the level of strings. we do this by comparing, in some detail, point-particle and
string probes. we will see how the extended nature of the string smears out the information that would
be obtainable by point-particle probes, and therefore, again, how it happily does away with the ultra-
short-distance behavior responsible for the central dilemma of contemporary physics.

we first consider the way in which point particles would interact, if they were actually to exist,
and hence how they could be used as physical probes. the most basic interaction is between two
point particles movi

nt trajectories.

we are concerned with the details of the interaction—specifically, the point where the initial
electron and positron annihilate and produce the photon. the central fact, as will become apparent, is
that there is an unambiguous, completely identifiable time and place where this happens: it is marked
in figure 6.6.

how  does  this  description  change  if,  when  we  closely  examine  the  objects  we  thought  were
zero-dimensional points, they turn out to be one-dimensional strings? the basic process of interaction
is the same, but now the objects on a collision course are oscillating loops, as shown in figure 6.7. if
these loops are vibrating in just the right resonance patterns, they will correspond to an electron and a
positron on collision course, just as in figure 6.6. only when examined at the most minute distance
scales, far smaller than anything our present technology can access, is their true stringlike character
apparent. as in the point-particle case, the two 
 
 ___________________________
 
strings collide and again annihilate each other in a
flash. the flash, a photon, is itself a string in a particular vibrational pattern. thus, the two incoming
strings interact by merging together and producing a third string, as shown in figure 6.7. just as in our
point-particle description, this string travels a bit, and then releases the energy derived from the two
initial  strings  by  dissociating  into  two  strings  that  travel  onward.  again,  from  any  but  the  most
microscopic perspective, this will look just like the point-particle interaction of figure 6.6.

there is, howeve

r, a crucial difference between the two descriptions. we emphasized that the
point-particle  interaction  occurs  at  an  identifiable  point  in  space  and  time,  a  location  that  all
observers can agree on. as we shall now see, this is not true for interactions between strings. we
will show this by comparing how george and gracie, two observers in relative motion as in chapter
2, would describe the interaction. we will see that they do not agree on where and when the two
strings touch for the first time.

to do so, imagine that we view the interaction between two strings with a camera whose shutter
is kept open so that the whole history of the process is captured on one piece of film.10 we show the
result—known as a string world-sheet—in figure 6.7(c). by "slicing" the world-sheet into parallel
pieces—much as one slices a loaf of bread—the moment-by-moment history of the string interaction
can be recovered. we show an example of this slicing in figure 6.8. spe

show george, intently focused on the two incoming strings, together with an attached plane that slices
through all events in space that occur at the same time, according to his perspective. as we have

clarity. in reality, of course, there is a three-dimensional array of events that occur at the same time
according to any observer. figures 6.8(b) and 6.8(c) give a couple of snapshots at subsequent times

other. of central importance, in figure 6.8(c) we show the instant in time, according to george, when
the two strings first touch and merge together, producing the third string.

let's now do the same for gracie. as discussed in chapter 2, the relative motion of george and
gracie  implies  that  they  do  not  agree  on  what  events  occur  at  the  same  time.  from  gracie's
perspective the events in space that occur simultaneously lie on a different plane, as shown in figure
6.9. that is, from gracie's perspective, the world-sheet of figure 6.7(c) must be "sliced" into pieces

viewpoint.

in figures 6.9(b) and 6.9(c) we show subsequent moments in time, now according to gracie,

including the moment when she sees the two incoming strings touch and produce the third string.

by comparing figures 6.8(c) and 6.9(c), as we do in figure 6.10, we see that george and gracie
do not agree on when and where the two initial strings first touch—where they interact. the string,
being an extended object, ensures that there is no unambiguous location in space or moment in time
when the strings first interact—rather, it depends upon the state of motion of the observer.

if we apply exactly the same reasoning to the interaction of point particles, as summarized in

rlier—there is a definite point in space and moment
in time when the point particles interact. point particles cram all of their interaction into a definite
point.  when  the  force  involved  in  an  interaction  is  the  gravitational  force—that  is,  when  the
messenger particle involved in the interaction is the graviton instead of the photon—this complete
packing of the force's punch into a single point leads to disastrous results, such as the infinite answers
we alluded to earlier. strings, by contrast, "smear" out the place where interactions occur. because
different observers perceive that the interaction takes place at various locations along the left part of
the  surface  of  figure  6.10,  in  a  real  sense  this  means  that  the  interaction  location  is  smeared  out
among all of them. this spreads out the force's punch and, in the case of the gravitational force, this
smearing  significantly  dilutes  its  ultramicroscopic  properties—so  much  so  that  calculation

smearing encountered in the rough answer of the last section. and once again, this smearing results in
a smoothing of the ultramicroscopic jitteriness of space as sub-planck-length distances are blurred
together.

sharp focus. the incompatibility of general relativity and quantum mechanics—which would become
apparent only on sub-planck-scale distances—is avoided in a universe that has a lower limit on the
distances that can be accessed, or even said to exist, in the conventional sense. such is the universe
described  by  string  theory,  in  which  we  see  that  the  laws  of  the  large  and  the  small  can  be
harmoniously merged together as the supposed catastrophe arising on ultramicroscopic distances is
summarily done away with.

starlight by the sun had been established, the dutch physicist hendrik lorentz sent einstein a telegram

particles  all  have  "spin-1/2,"  where  the  value  1/2  is,  roughly  speaking,  a  quantum-mechanical

nongravitational force carriers—photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—also possess an intrinsic

twice the spin of photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—i.e., "spin-2."

a loose picture to have in mind. by the way, we can now clarify an important issue we encountered

quantum theory incorporating the gravitational force, they did so because they had found that strings
necessarily  have  a  vibrational  pattern  in  their  repertoire  that  is massless  and  has  spin-2—the
hallmark features of the graviton. where there is a graviton there is also gravity.

ingredients. since none of the superpartner particles has ever been detected, you would be justified to
take rabi's remark from chapter 1 regarding the discovery of the muon one step further, declare that
"nobody ordered supersymmetry," and summarily reject this symmetry principle. for three reasons,
however,  many  physicists  believe  strongly  that  such  an  out-of-hand  dismissal  of  supersymmetry
would be quite premature. let's discuss these reasons.

the case for supersymmetry: prior to string theory

first, from an aesthetic standpoint, physicists find it hard to believe that nature would respect almost,
but not quite all of the symmetries that are mathematically possible. of course, it is possible that an
incomplete utilization of symmetry is what actually occurs, but it would be such a shame. it would be

 again, that nothing in the design of nature dictates that these force strengths must exactly match
on  microscopic  scales.  and  finally,  you  might  suggest  that  a  simpler  explanation  for  why  the
superpartner  particles  have  never  been  found  is  that  our  universe  is  not  supersymmetric  and,
therefore, the superpartners do not exist.

no  one  can  refute  any  of  these  responses.  but  the  case  for  supersymmetry  is  strengthened

immensely when we consider its role in string theory.

supersymmetry in string theory

the original string theory that emerged from veneziano's work in the late 1960s incorporated all of
the symmetries discussed at the beginning of this chapter, but it did not incorporate supersymmetry
(which  had  not  yet  been  discovered).  this  first  theory  based  on  the  string  concept  was,  more
precisely,  called  the bosonic string theory.  the  name bosonic  indicates  that  all  of  the  vibrational
patterns of the bosonic string have spi
 
 ___________________________
 
ns that are a whole number—there are no fermionic patterns,
that is, no patterns with spins differing from a whole number by a half unit. this led to two problems.
first,  if  string  theory  was  to  describe  all  forces  and  all  matter,  it  would  somehow  have  to
incorporate  fermionic  vibrational  patterns,  since  the  known  matter  particles  all  have  spin-1/2.
second, and far more troubling, was the realization that there was one pattern of vibration in bosonic
string theory whose mass (more precisely, whose mass squared) was negative—a so-called tachyon.
even before string theory, physicists had studied the possibility that our world might have tachyon
particles, in addition to the familiar particles that all have positive masses, but their efforts showed
that it is difficult if not impossible for such a theory to be logically sensible. similarly, in the context
of  bosonic  string  theory,  physicists  tried  all  sorts  of  fancy  footwork  to  make  se
 
 ___________________________
 
nse  of  the  bizarre
prediction of a tachyon vibrational pattern, but to no avail. these features made it increasingly clear
that although it was an interesting theory, the bosonic string was missing something essential.

in  1971,  pierre  ramond  of  the  university  of  florida  took  up  the  challenge  of  modifying  the
bosonic  string  theory  to  include  fermionic  patterns  of  vibration.  through  his  work  and  subsequent
results of schwarz and andre neveu, a new version of string theory began to emerge. and much to
everyone's surprise, the bosonic and the fermionic patterns of vibration of this new theory appeared
to come in pairs. for each bosonic pattern there was a fermionic pattern, and vice versa. by 1977,
insights  of  ferdinando  gliozzi  of  the  university  of  turin,  scherk,  and  david  olive  of  imperial
college put this pairing into the proper light. the new string theory incorporated supersymmetry, and
the  observed  pairing  of  bosonic  and  fermionic 
 
 ___________________________
 
 vibrational  patterns  reflected  this  highly  symmetric
character. supersymmetric string theory—superstring theory, that is—had been born. moreover, the
work of gliozzi, scherk, and olive had one other crucial result: they showed that the troublesome
tachyon vibration of the bosonic string does not afflict the superstring. slowly, the pieces of the string
puzzle were falling into place.

nevertheless, the major initial impact of the work of ramond, and also of neveu and schwarz,
was not actually in string theory. by 1973, the physicists julius wess and bruno zumino realized that
supersymmetry—the new symmetry emerging from the reformulation of string theory—was applicable
even to theories based on point particles. they rapidly made important strides toward incorporating
supersymmetry  into  the  framework  of  point-particle  quantum  field

 theory. and  since,  at  the  time,
quantum field theory was the central rage of the mainstream particle-physics community—with string
theory increasingly becoming a subject on the fringe—the insights of wess and zumino launched a
tremendous amount of subsequent research on what has come to be called supersymmetric quantum
field theory. the supersymmetric standard model, discussed in the preceding section, is one of the
crowning theoretical achievements of these pursuits; we now see that, through historical twists and
turns, even this point-particle theory owes a great debt to string theory.

context  of  its  original  discovery.  and  in  this  framework,  the  case  for  supersymmetry  goes  well
beyond that presented in the preceding section. string theory is the only way we know of to merge
general relativity and quantum mechanics. but it's only the supersymmetric version of string theory
that  avoids  the  pernicious  tachyon  problem  and  that  has  fermionic  vibrational  patterns  that  can
account  for  the  matter  particles  constituting  the  world  around  us.  supersymmetry  therefore  comes

the second explanation, you are presented with a third, a fourth, and even a fifth explanation—each
different  from  the  others  and  yet  equally  convincing.  no  doubt,  by  the  end  of  the  experience  you
would  feel  no  closer  to  amelia  earhart's  true  fate  than  you  did  at  the  outset.  in  the  arena  of
fundamental explanations, more is definitely less.

by  1985,  string  theory—notwithstanding  the  justified  excitement  it  was  engendering—was
starting to sound like our overzealous earhart expert. the reason is that by 1985 physicists realized
that  supersymmetry,  by  then  a  central  element  in  the  structure  of  string  theory,  could  actually  be
incorporated into string theory in not one but five different ways. each method results in a pairing of
bosonic and fermionic vibrational patterns, but the details of this pairing as well as numerous o

properties of the resulting theories differ substantially. although their names are not all that important,
it's worth recording that these five supersymmetric string theories are called the type i theory, the
type iia theory, the type iib theory, the heterotic type o(32) theory (pronounced "oh-thirty-two"),
and the heterotic type e8 × e8 theory (pronounced "e-eight times e-eight"). all the features of string
theory that we have discussed to this point are valid for each of these theories—they differ only in the
finer details.

having five different versions of what is supposedly the t.o.e.—possibly the ultimate unified
theory—was quite an embarrassment for string theorists. just as there is only one true explanation for
whatever happened to amelia earhart (regardless of whether we will ever find it), we expect the
same to be true regarding the deepest, most fundamental understanding of how th

one  suggestion  for  resolving  this  problem  might  be  that  although  there  are  five  different
superstring  theories,  four  might  be  ruled  out  simply  by  experiment,  leaving  one  true  and  relevant
explanatory  framework.  but  even  if  this  were  the  case,  we  would  still  be  left  with  the  nagging
question of why the other theories exist in the first place. in the wry words of witten, "if one of the
five theories describes our universe, who lives in the other four worlds?"7 a physicist's dream is that
the search for the ultimate answers will lead to a single, unique, absolutely in

ideally, the final theory—whether string theory or something else—should be the way it is because
there  simply  is  no  other  possibility.  if  we  were  to  discover  that  there  is  only  one  logically  sound
theory  incorporating  the  basic  ingredients  of  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics,  many  feel  that  we
would have reached the deepest understanding of why the universe has the properties it does. in short,
this would be unified-theory paradise.8

more dimensions than meet the eye

einstein resolved two of the major scientific conflicts of the past hundred years through special and
then  general  relativity. although  the  initial  problems  that  motivated  his  work  did  not  portend  the
outcome,  each  of  these  resolutions  completely  transformed  our  understanding  of  space  and  time.

einstein would likely have found remarkable, it requires that we subject our conceptions of space and
time  to  yet  another  radical  revision.  string  theory  so  thoroughly  shakes  the  foundations  of  modern
physics that even the generally accepted number of dimensions in our universe—something so basic
that you might think it beyond questioning—is dramatically and convincingly overthrown.

lations of space were lessened by supersymmetry, but not
sufficiently  to  yield  a  sensible  theory.  physicists  also  found  it  difficult  to  find  a  single,  sensible,
higher-dimensional theory incorporating all features of forces and matter.7

it  gradually  became  clear  that  bits  and  pieces  of  a  unified  theory  were  surfacing,  but  that  a
crucial element capable of tying them all together in a quantum-mechanically consistent manner was
missing. in 1984 this missing piece—string theory—dramatically entered the story and took center
stage.

more dimensions and string theory

by now you should be convinced that our universe may have additional curled-up spatial dimensions;

certainly, so long as they are small enough, nothing rules them out. but extra dimensions may strike
you as an artifice. our inability to probe distances smaller than a billionth of a billionth of a meter
permits  not  only  extra  tiny  dimensions  but  all  manner  of  whimsical  possibilities  a

microscopic  civilization  populated  by  even  tinier  green  people.  while  the  former  certainly  seems
more rationally motivated than the latter, the act of postulating either of these experimentally untested
—and, at present, untestable—possibilities might seem equally arbitrary.

such  was  the  case  until  string  theory.  here  is  a  theory  that  resolves  the  central  dilemma
confronting  contemporary  physics—the  incompatibility  between  quantum  mechanics  and  general
relativity—and that unifies our understanding of all of nature's fundamental material constituents and
forces. but to accomplish these feats, it turns out that string theory requires that the universe have
extra space dimensions.

here's  why.  one  of  the  main  insights  of  quantum  mechanics  is  that  our  predictive  p

ntages, probabilities are
numbers between 0 and 100. physicists have found that a key signal that a quantum-mechanical theory
has  gone  haywire  is  that  particular  calculations  yield  "probabilities"  that  are not  within  this
acceptable  range.  for  instance,  we  mentioned  earlier  that  a  sign  of  the  grinding  incompatibility
between general relativity and quantum mechanics in a point-particle framework is that calculations
result in infinite probabilities. as we have discussed, string theory cures these infinities. but what we
have not as yet mentioned is that a residual, somewhat more subtle problem still remains. in the early
days of string theory physicists found that certain calculations yielded negative probabilities, which
are also outside of the acceptable range. so, at first sight, string theory appeared to be awash in its
own quantum-mechanical hot water.

with stubborn determination, physicists sought and found the cause of this unacceptable feature.

on  begins  with  a  simple  observation.  if  a  string  is  constrained  to  lie  on  a  two-
dimensional  surface—such  as  the  surface  of  a  table  or  a  garden  hose—the  number  of  independent
directions in which it can vibrate is reduced to two: the left-right and back-forth dimensions along the
surface. any vibrational pattern that remains on the surface involves some combination of vibrations
in these two directions. correspondingly, we see that this also means that a string in flatland, the
garden-hose universe, or in any other two-dimensional universe, is also constrained to vibrate in a
total of two independent spatial directions. if, however, the string is allowed to leave the surface, the
number  of  independent  vibrational  directions  increases  to  three,  since  the  string  then  can  also
oscillate in the up-down direction. equivalently, in a universe with three spatial dimensions, a string
can vibrate in three independent directions. although it gets h

arder to envision, the pattern continues:
in a universe with ever more spatial dimensions, there are ever more independent directions in which
it can vibrate.

we  emphasize  this  fact  of  string  vibrations  because  physicists  found  that  the  troublesome
calculations  were  highly  sensitive  to  the  number  of  independent  directions  in  which  a  string  can
vibrate.  the  negative  probabilities  arose  from  a mismatch  between  what  the  theory  required  and
what  reality  seemed  to  impose:  the  calculations  showed  that  if  strings  could  vibrate  in nine
independent spatial directions, all of the negative probabilities would cancel out. well, that's great in
theory, but so what? if string theory is meant to describe our world with three spatial dimensions, we
still seem to be in trouble.

ry-old lead, we see that kaluza and klein provide a
loophole. since strings are so small, not only can they vibrate in large, extended dimensions, they can
also  vibrate  in  ones  that  are  tiny  and  curled  up.  and  so  we can  meet  the  nine-space-dimension
requirement of string theory in our universe, by assuming—a la kaluza and klein—that in addition to
our familiar three extended spatial dimensions there are six other curled-up spatial dimensions. in this
manner, string theory, which appeared to be on the brink of elimination from the realm of physical
relevance, is saved. moreover, rather than just postulating the existence of extra dimensions, as had
been  done  by  kaluza,  klein,  and  their  followers,  string  theory requires  them.  for  string  theory  to
make sense, the universe should have nine space dimensions and one time dimension, for a total of ten
dimensions. in this way, kaluza's 1919 proposal finds its most convincing and powerful forum.

e questions

this raises a number of questions. first, why does string theory require the particular number of nine
space dimensions to avoid nonsensical probability values? this is probably the hardest question in
string theory to answer without appealing to mathematical formalism. a straightforward string theory
calculation reveals this answer, but no one has an intuitive, nontechnical explanation for the particular
number that emerges. the physicist ernest rutherford once said, in essence, that if you can't explain a
result  in  simple,  nontechnical  terms,  then  you  don't  really  understand  it.  he  wasn't  saying  that  this
means your result is wrong; rather, he was saying that it means you do not fully understand its origin,
meaning,  or  implications.  perhaps  this  is  true  regardi

theory.  (in  fact,  let's  take  this  opportunity  to  brace—parenthetically—for  a  central  aspect  of  the
second  superstring  revolution  that  we  will  discuss  in  chapter  12.  the  calculation  underlying  the
conclusion  that  there  are  ten  spacetime  dimensions—nine  space  and  one  time—turns  out  to  be
approximate.  in  the  mid-1990s,  witten,  based  on  his  own  insights  and  previous  work  by  michael

string theory, he argued to most string theorists' amazement, actually requires ten space dimensions
and one time dimension, for a total of eleven dimensions. we will ignore this important result until
chapter 12, as it will have little direct bearing on the material we develop before then.)

second, if the equations of string theory (or, more precisely, the approximate equations guiding
our  pre–chapter  12  discussion)  show  that  the  universe  has  nine  space  dimensions  and  one  time
dimension, why is it that three space (and one time) dimensions are large and extended while all of
the  others  are  tiny  and  curled  up?  why  aren't  they all  extended,  or  all  curled  up,  or  some  other
possibility in between? at present no one knows the answer to this question. if string theory is right,

might be that
curled-up time dimensions have different properties from the familiar, vast time dimension that we
imagine  reaching  back  to  the  creation  of  the  universe  and  forward  to  the  present  moment.  but,  in
contrast  to  extra  spatial  dimensions,  new  and  previously  unknown  time  dimensions  would  clearly
require an even more monumental restructuring of our intuition. some theorists have been exploring
the  possibility  of  incorporating  extra  time  dimensions  into  string  theory,  but  as  yet  the  situation  is
inconclusive. in our discussion of string theory, we will stick to the more "conventional" approach in
which all of the curled-up dimensions are space dimensions, but the intriguing possibility of new time
dimensions could well play a role in future developments.

the physical implications of extra dimensions

years  of  research,  dating  back  to  kaluza's  original  paper,  have  shown  that  even  though  any  extra
dimensions  that  physicists  pr

opose  must  be  smaller  than  we  or  our  equipment  can  directly  "see"
(since we haven't seen them), they do have important indirect effects on the physics that we observe.
in  string  theory,  this  connection  between  the  microscopic  properties  of  space  and  the  physics  we
observe is particularly transparent.

to understand this, you need to recall that masses and charges of particles in string theory are
determined by the possible resonant vibrational string patterns. picture a tiny string as it moves and
oscillates, and you will realize that the resonant patterns are influenced by its spatial surroundings.
think,  for  example,  of  ocean  waves.  out  in  the  grand  expanse  of  the  open  ocean,  isolated  wave
patterns  are  relatively  free  to  form  and  travel  this  way  or  that.  this  is  much  like  the  vibrational
patterns of a string as it moves through large, extended spatial dimensions. as in chapter 6, such a
string is equally f

ls through which the water is channeled, and so on. or, think of an organ pipe or
a french horn. the sounds that each of these instruments can produce are a direct consequence of the
resonant patterns of vibrating air streams in their interior; these are determined by the precise size

and  shape  of  the  spatial  surroundings  within  the  instrument  through  which  the  air  streams  are
channeled. curled-up spatial dimensions have a similar impact on the possible vibrational patterns of
a string. since tiny strings vibrate through all of the spatial dimensions, the precise way in which the
extra  dimensions  are  twisted  up  and  curled  back  on  each  other  strongly  influences  and  tightly
constrains  the  possible  resonant  vibrational  patterns.  these  patterns,  largely  determined  by  the
extradimensional  geometry,  constitute  the  array  of  possible  particle  properties  observed  in  the
familiar extended dimensions. this means that extradimensional geometry determin

physical attributes like particle masses and charges that we observe in the usual three large space
dimensions of common experience.

this is such a deep and important point that we say it once again, with feeling. according to
string  theory,  the  universe  is  made  up  of  tiny  strings  whose  resonant  patterns  of  vibration  are  the
microscopic  origin  of  particle  masses  and  force  charges.  string  theory  also  requires  extra  space
dimensions that must be curled up to a very small size to be consistent with our never having seen
them. but a tiny string can probe a tiny space. as a string moves about, oscillating as it travels, the
geometrical  form  of  the  extra  dimensions  plays  a  critical  role  in  determining  resonant  patterns  of
vibration.  because  the  patterns  of  string  vibrations  appear  to  us  as  the  masses  and  charges  of  the
elementary particles, we concl
 
 ___________________________
 
ude that these fundamental properties of the universe are determined, in
large measure, by the geometrical size and shape of the extra dimensions. that's one of the most far-
reaching insights of string theory.

since the extra dimensions so profoundly influence basic physical properties of the universe, we
should now seek—with unbridled vigor—an understanding of what these curled-up dimensions look
like.

what do the curled-up dimensions look like?

the extra spatial dimensions of string theory cannot be "crumpled" up any which way; the equations
that emerge from the theory severely restrict the geometrical form that they can take. in 1984, philip
candelas  of  the  university  of  texas  at  austin,  gary  horowitz  and  andrew  strominger  of  the
university of california at santa barbara, and edward witten showed that a particular class of six-
dimensional geometrical shapes can meet these conditions. they are known as calabi-yau spaces (or
calabi-yau  shapes)  in  honor  of

  two  mathematicians,  eugenio  calabi  from  the  university  of
pennsylvania and shing-tung yau from harvard university, whose research in a related context, but
prior to string theory, plays a central role in understanding these spaces. although the mathematics
describing calabi-yau spaces is intricate and subtle, we can get an idea of what they look like with a
picture.8

in figure 8.9 we show an example of a calabi-yau space. 9 as you view this figure, you must
bear  in  mind  that  the  image  has  built-in  limitations.  we  are  trying  to  represent  a  six-dimensional
shape on a two-dimensional piece of paper, and this introduces significant distortions. nevert

the image does convey the rough idea of what a calabi-yau space looks like. 10 the shape in figure
8.9 is but one of many tens of thousands of examples of calabi-yau shapes that meet the stringent
requirements for the extra dimensions that emerge from string theory. although belonging to a club
with  tens  of  thousands  of  members  might  not  sound  very  exclusive,  you  must  compare  it  with  the
infinite number of shapes that are mathematically possible; by this measure calabi-yau spaces are
rare indeed.

the
three  familiar  extended  dimensions,  string  theory  claims  that  there  are  six  hitherto  unanticipated
dimensions, tightly curled up into one of these rather complicated-looking shapes, as illustrated in
figure  8.10.  these  dimensions  are  an  integral  and  ubiquitous  part  of  the  spatial  fabric;  they  exist
everywhere. for instance, if you sweep your hand in a large arc, you are moving not only through the
three  extended  dimensions,  but  also  through  these  curled-up  dimensions.  of  course,  because  the
curled-up  
 
 ___________________________
 
dimensions  are  so  small,  as  you  move  your  hand  you  circumnavigate  them  an  enormous
number of times, repeatedly returning to your starting point. their tiny extent means that there is not
much room for a large object like your hand to move—it all averages out so that after sweeping your
arm,  you  are  completely  unaware  of  the  journey  you  took  through  the  curled-up  calabi-yau
dimensions.

figure 8.10 according to string theory, the universe has extra dimensions curled up into a calabi-
yau shape.

this is a stunning feature of string theory. but if you are practically minded, you are bound to
bring the discussion back to an essential and concrete issue. now that we have a better sense of what
the extra dimensions look like, what are the physical properties that emerge from strings that vibrate
through them, and how do these properties compare with experimental observations? this is string

the smoking gun: experimental signatures

nothing would please string theorists more than to proudly present the world with a list of detailed,
experimentally testable predictions. certainly, there is no way to establish that any theory describes
our  world  without  subjecting  its  predictions  to  experimental  verification.  and  no  matter  how
compelling a picture string theory paints, if it does not accurately describe our universe, it will be no
more relevant than an elaborate game of dungeons and dragons.

edward  witten  is  fond  of  declaring  that  string  theory  has  already  made  a  dramatic  and
experimentally  confirmed  prediction:  "string  theory  has  the  remarkable  property  of predicting
gravity."1 what witten means by this is that both newton and einstein developed theories of gravity
because their observations of the world clearly showed 
 
 ___________________________
 
them that gravity exists, and that, therefore, it
required an accurate and consistent explanation. on the contrary, a physicist studying string theory—
even if he or she was completely unaware of general relativity—would be inexorably led to it by the
string framework. through its massless spin-2 graviton pattern of vibration, string theory has gravity
thoroughly sewn into its theoretical fabric. as witten has said, "the fact that gravity is a consequence
of  string  theory  is  one  of  the  greatest  theoretical  insights  ever."2  in  acknowledging  that  this
"prediction" is more precisely labeled a "postdiction" because physicists had discovered theoretical
descriptions of gravity before they knew of string theory, witten points out that this is a mere accident
of history on earth. in other advanced civilizations in the universe, witten fancifully argues, it is quite
possible  that  string  theory  was  discovered  first,  and  a  theory  of  gravity

 found  as  a  stunning
consequence.

since  we  are  bound  to  the  history  of  science  on  our  planet,  there  are  many  who  find  this
postdiction of gravity unconvincing experimental confirmation of string theory. most physicists would
be far happier with one of two things: a bona fide prediction from string theory that experimentalists
could confirm, or a postdiction of some property of the world (like the mass of the electron or the
existence of three families of particles) for which there is currently no explanation. in this chapter we
will discuss how far string theorists have gone toward reaching these goals.

ironically,  we  will  see  that  although  string  theory  has  the  potential  to  be the  most  predictive
theory  that  physicists  have  ever  studied—a  theory  that  has  the  c

the
precision necessary to confront experimental data. like a child who receives his or her dream gift for
christmas but can't quite get it to work because a few pages of the instructions are missing, today's
physicists are in possession of what may well be the holy grail of modern science, but they can't
unleash  its  full  predictive  power  until  they  succeed  in writing  the  full  instruction  manual.
nevertheless, as we discuss in this chapter, with a bit of luck, one central feature of string theory
could  receive  experimental  verification  within  the  next  decade. and  with  a  good  deal  more  luck,
indirect fingerprints of the theory could be confirmed at any moment.

is string theory right? we don't know. if you share the belief that the laws of physics should not be
fragmented into those that govern the large and those that govern the small, and if you also believe that
we should not rest until we have a theory whose range of applicability is limitless, string

imagination  rather  than  some  fundamental  uniqueness  of  string  theory.  perhaps. you  might  further
argue that, like the man searching for his lost keys solely under a street light, physicists are huddled
around string theory merely because the vagaries of scientific history have shed one random ray of
insight  in  this  direction.  maybe.  and,  if  you're  either  relatively  conservative  or  fond  of  playing
devil's advocate, you might even say that physicists have no business wasting time on a theory that
postulates a new feature of nature some hundred million billion times smaller than anything we can
directly probe experimentally.

if you voiced these complaints in the 1980s when string theory first m

have been joined by some of the most respected physicists of our age. for instance, in the mid-1980s
nobel  prize–winning  harvard  physicist  sheldon  glashow,  together  with  physicist  paul  ginsparg,
then also at harvard, publicly disparaged string theory's lack of experimental accessibility:

in lieu of the traditional confrontation between theory and experiment, superstring theorists
pursue an inner harmony, where elegance, uniqueness and beauty define truth. the theory
depends  for  its  existence  upon  magical  coincidences,  miraculous  cancellations  and
relations  among  seemingly  unrelated  (and  possibly  undiscovered)  fields  of  mathematics.
are  these  properties  reasons  to  accept  the  reality  of  superstrings?  do  mathematics  and
aesthetics supplant and transcend mere experiment?3

elsewhere, glashow went on to say,

superstring theory is so a
 
 ___________________________
 
mbitious that it can only be totally right, or totally wrong. the
only problem is that the mathematics is so new and difficult that we won't know which for
decades to come.4

and he even questioned whether string theorists should "be paid by physics departments and allowed
to pervert impressionable students," warning that string theory was was undermining science, much as
medieval theology did during the middle ages.5

richard feynman, shortly before he died, made it clear that he did not believe that string theory

nfinities. the fact that a theory
gets rid of infinities is to me not a sufficient reason to believe its uniqueness.6

and howard georgi, glashow's eminent harvard colleague and collaborator, was also a vociferous
string critic in the late 1980s:

if  we  allow  ourselves  to  be  beguiled  by  the  siren  call  of  the  "ultimate"  unification  at
distances  so  small  that  our  experimental  friends  cannot  help  us,  then  we  are  in  trouble,
because we will lose that crucial process of pruning of irrelevant ideas which distinguishes
physics from so many other less interesting human activities.7

as with many issues of great importance, for each of these naysayers, there is an enthusiastic
supporter. wi
 
 ___________________________
 
tten has said that when he learned how string theory incorporates gravity and quantum
mechanics, it was "the greatest intellectual thrill" of his life.8 cumrun vafa, a leading string theorist
from harvard university, has said that "string theory is definitely revealing the deepest understanding
of the universe which we have ever had."9 and nobel prize–winner murray gell-mann has said that
string theory is "a fantastic thing" and that he expects that some version of string theory will someday
be the theory of the whole world.10

as you can see, the debate is fueled in part by physics and in part by distinct philosophies about
how  physics  should  be  done.  the  "traditionalists"  want  theoretical  work  to  be  closely  tied  to
experimental observation, largely in the successful research mold of the last few centuries. but others
think that we are ready to tackle questions that are beyond our present technological ability to test
directly.

hies notwithstanding, during the past decade much of the criticism of string

theory has subsided. glashow attributes this to two things. first, he notes that in the mid-1980s,

string theorists were enthusiastically and exuberantly proclaiming that they would shortly
answer all questions in physics. as they are now more prudent with their enthusiasm, much
of my criticism in the 1980s is no longer that relevant.11

second, he also points out,

we non–string theorists have not made any progress whatsoever in the last decade. so the
argument  that  string  theory  is  the  only  game  in  town  is  a  very  strong  and  powerful  one.
there are questions that will not be answered in the framework of conventional quantum
field theory. that much is clear. they may be answered by something else, and the only
something else i know of is string theory.12

georgi reflects back on the 1980s in much the same way:

at various times in its early history, stri

ng theory has gotten oversold. in the intervening
years i have found that some of the ideas of string theory have led to interesting ways of
thinking about physics which have been useful to me in my own work. i am much happier
now to see people spending their time on string theory since i can now see how something
useful will come out of it.13

theorist david gross, a leader in both conventional and string physics, has eloquently summed up the
situation in the following way:

it used to be that as we were climbing the mountain of nature the experimentalists would

lead the way. we lazy theorists would lag behind. every once in a while they would kick
down an experimental stone which would bounce off our heads. eventually we would get
the idea and we would follow the path that was broken by the experimentalists. once we
joined our friends we would explain to them what the view was and how they go

t there.
that was the old and easy way (at least for theorists) to climb the mountain. we all long for
the return of those days. but now we theorists might have to take the lead. this is a much
more lonely enterprise.14

string theorists have no desire for a solo trek to the upper reaches of mount nature; they would
far  prefer  to  share  the  burden  and  the  excitement  with  experimental  colleagues.  it  is  merely  a
technological mismatch in our current situation—a historical asynchrony—that the theoretical ropes
and  crampons  for  the  final  push  to  the  top  have  at  least  been  partially  fashioned,  while  the
experimental ones do not yet exist. but this does not mean that string theory is fundam

from experiment. rather, string theorists have high hopes of "kicking down a theoretical stone" from
the ultra-high-energy mountaintop to experimentalists working at a lower base camp. this is a prime
goal of present-day research in string theory. no stones have as yet been dislodged from the summit to
be  sent  hurtling  down,  but,  as  we  now  discuss,  a  few  tantalizing  and  promising  pebbles  certainly
have.

the road to experiment

without monumental technological breakthroughs, we will never be able to focus on the tiny length
scales necessary to see a string directly. physicists can probe down to a billionth of a billionth of a
meter  with  accelerators  that  are  roughly  a  few  miles  in  size.  probing  smaller

higher energies and this means larger machines capable of focusing that energy on a single particle.
as the planck length is some 17 orders of magnitude smaller than what we can currently access, using
today's technology we would need an accelerator the size of the galaxy to see individual strings. in
fact,  shmuel  nussinov  of  tel  aviv  university  has  shown  that  this  rough  estimate  based  on
straightforward  scaling  is  likely  to  be  overly  optimistic;  his  more  careful  study  indicates  that  we
would require an accelerator the size of the whole universe. (the energy required to probe matter at
the planck length is roughly equal to a thousand kilowatt-hours—the energy needed to run an average
air  conditioner  for  about  one  hundred  hours—and  so  is  not  part

icularly  outlandish.  the  seemingly
insurmountable technological challenge is to focus all of this energy on a single particle, that is, on a
single  string.)  as  the  u.s.  congress  ultimately  canceled  funding  for  the  superconducting
supercollider—an  accelerator  a  "mere"  54  miles  in  circumference—don't  hold  your  breath  while
waiting  for  the  money  for  a  planck-probing  accelerator.  if  we  are  going  to  test  string  theory
experimentally,  it  will  have  to  be  in  an  indirect  manner.  we  will  have  to  determine  physical
implications of string theory that can be observed on length scales that are far larger than the size of a
string itself.15

in their groundbreaking paper, candelas, horowitz, strominger, and witten took the first steps
toward this goal. they not only found that the extra dimensions in string theory must be curled up into
a  calabi-yau  shape,  but  they  also  worked  out  some  
 
 ___________________________
 
of  the  implications  this  has  on  the  possible
patterns  of  string  vibrations.  one  central  result  they  found  highlights  the  amazingly  unexpected
solutions string theory offers to long-standing particle-physics problems.

recall that the elementary particles that physicists have found fall into three families of identical
organization, with the particles in each successive family being increasingly massive. the puzzling
question for which there was no insight prior to string theory is, why families and why three? here is
string theory's proposal. a typical calabi-yau shape contains  holes that are analogous to those found
at the center of a phonograph record, or a doughnut, or a "multidoughnut", as shown in figure 9.1. in
the higher-dimensional calabi-yau context, there are actually a variety of different types of holes that
can arise—holes which themselves can have a variety of dimensions ("multidimensional holes")—but
figure 9.1 conveys the basic idea. candel

as, horowitz, strominger, and witten closely examined the
effect that these holes have on the possible patterns of string vibration, and here is what they found.

there is a family of lowest-energy string vibrations associated with each hole in the calabi-yau
portion of space. because the familiar elementary particles should correspond to the lowest-energy
oscillatory  patterns,  the  existence  of  multiple  holes—somewhat  like  those  in  the  multidoughnut—
means that the patterns of string vibrations will fall into multiple families. if the curled-up calabi-
yau has three holes, then we will find three families of elementary particles. 16 and so, string theory
proclaims that the family organization observed experimentally, rather than being some unexplainable
feature of either random or divine origin, is a reflection of the number of holes in the geometrical
shape comprising the extra dimensions! this is the kind of result that makes a physicist's heart skip a
beat.

energies. after all, experimentalists can establish—in fact, already have established—the number of
particle families: 3. unfortunately, the number of holes contained in each of the tens of thousands of
known calabi-yau shapes spans a wide range. some have 3. but others have 4, 5, 25, and so on—
some even have as many as 480 holes. the problem is that at present no one knows how to deduce
from the equations of string theory which of the calabi-yau shapes constitutes the extra spatial
dimensions. if we could find the principle that allows the selection of one calabi-yau shape from the
numerous possibilities, then indeed a stone from the mountaintop would go tumbling down into the
experimentalists' camp. if the particular calabi-yau shape singled out by the equations of the theory
were  to  have  three  holes,  we  would  have  found  an  impressive  postdiction  from  string  theory

ture  of  the  world  that  is  otherwise  completely  mysterious.  but  finding  the
principle  for  choosing  among  calabi-yau  shapes  is  a  problem  that  as  yet  remains  unsolved.
nevertheless—and this is the important point—we see that string theory provides the potential for
answering this basic puzzle of particle physics, and this in itself is substantial progress.

the number of families is but one experimental consequence of the geometrical form of the extra

dimensions. through their effect on possible patterns of string vibrations, other consequences of the
extra dimensions include the detailed properties of the force and matter particles. as one primary
example, subsequent work by strominger and witten showed that the masses

 of the particles in each
family depend upon—hang on, this is a bit tricky—the way in which the boundaries of the various
multidimensional holes in the calabi-yau shape intersect and overlap with one another. it's hard to
visualize, but the idea is that as strings vibrate through the extra curled-up dimensions, the precise
arrangement of the various holes and the way in which the calabi-yau shape folds around them has a
direct  impact  on  the  possible  resonant  patterns  of  vibration.  although  the  details  get  difficult  to
follow and are really not all that essential, what is important is that, as with the number of families,
string theory can provide us with a framework for answering questions—such as why the electron and
other  particles  h

ave  the  masses  they  do—on  which  previous  theories  are  completely  silent.  once
again, though, carrying through with such calculations requires that we know which calabi-yau space
to take for the extra dimensions.

the  preceding  discussion  gives  some  idea  of  how  string  theory  may  one  day  explain  the
properties of the matter particles recorded in table 1.1. string theorists believe that a similar story
will one day also explain the properties of the messenger particles of the fundamental forces, listed in
table 1.2. that is, as strings twist and vibrate while meandering through the extended and curled-up
dimensions, a small subset of their vast oscillatory repertoire consists of vibrations with spin equal to
1 or 2. these are the candidate force-carrying string-vibrational states. regardless of the shape of the
calabi-yau space, there is always one vibra

tional pattern that is massless and has spin-2; we identify
this pattern as the graviton. the precise list of spin-1 messenger particles—their number, the strength
of the force they convey, the gauge symmetries they respect—though, does depend crucially on the
precise geometrical form of the curled-up dimensions. and so, once again, we come to realize that
string  theory  provides  a  framework  for  explaining  the  observed  messenger-particle  content  of  our
universe,  that  is,  for  explaining  the  properties  of  the  fundamental  forces,  but  that  without  knowing
exactly which calabi-yau shape the extra dimensions are curled into, we cannot make any definitive
predictions or postdictions (beyond witten's remark regarding the postdiction of gravity).

why can't we figure out which is the "right" calabi-yau shape? most string theorists blame

on the inadequacy of the theoretical tools currently being used to analyze string theory. as we shall
discuss in some detail in chapter 12, the mathematical framework of string theory is so complicated
that physicists have been able to perform only approximate calculations through a formalism known
as perturbation theory. in this approximation scheme, each possible calabi-yau shape appears to be
on equal footing with every other; none is fundamentally singled out by the equations. and since the
physical  consequences  of  string  theory  depend  sensitively  on  the  precise  form  of  the  curled-up
dimensions,  without  the  ability  to  select  one  calabi-yau  spa

he  many,  no  definitive
experimentally testable conclusions can be drawn. a driving force behind present-day research is to
develop theoretical methods that transcend the approximate approach in the hope that, among other
benefits,  we  will  be  led  to  a  unique  calabi-yau  shape  for  the  extra  dimensions.  we  will  discuss
progress along these lines in chapter 13.

exhausting possibilities

so  you  might  ask:  even  though  we  can't  as  yet  figure  out  which  calabi-yau  shape  string  theory
selects, does any choice yield physical properties that agree with what we observe? in other words,

if we were to work out the corresponding physical properties associated with each and every calabi-
yau  shape  and  collect  them  in  a  giant  catalog,  would  we  find  any  that  match  reality?  this  is  an
important question, but, for two main reasons, it is also a hard one to answer fully.

a sensible start is to focus only on those calabi-yau shapes that yield three families.

amounts  to  an  infinite  sequence  of  shapes.  (when  we  mentioned  earlier  that  there  were  tens  of
thousands  of  calabi-yau  shapes,  we  were  already  grouping  together  all  those  shapes  that  can  be
changed into one another by such smooth deformations, and we were counting the whole group as one
calabi-yau  space.)  the  problem  is  that  the  detailed  physical  properties  of  string  vibrations,  their
masses and their response to forces, are very much affected by such detailed changes in shape, but
once again, we have no means of selecting one possibility over any other. and no matter how many
graduate students physics professors might set to work, it's just not possible to figure out the physics
corresponding to an infinite list of different shapes.

anging the number of holes it contains.

this  realization  has  led  string  theorists  to  examine  the  physics  resulting  from  a  sample  of
possible  calabi-yau  shapes.  even  here,  however,  life  is  not  completely  smooth  sailing.  the
approximate  equations  that  string  theorists  currently  use  are  not  powerful  enough  to  work  out  the
resulting physics fully for any given choice of calabi-yau shape. they can take us a long way toward
understanding, in the sense of a ballpark estimate, the properties of the string vibrations that we hope
will align with the particles we observe. but precise and definitive physical conclusions, such as the
mass of the electron or the strength of the weak force, require equations that are far more exact than
the present

the  "natural"  energy  scale  of  string  theory  is  the  planck  energy,  and  it  is  only  through  extremely
delicate cancellations that string theory yields vibrational patterns with masses in the vicinity of those
of the known matter and force particles. delicate cancellations require precise calculations because
even small errors have a profound impact on accuracy. as we will discuss in chapter 12, during the
mid-1990s  physicists  have  made  significant  progress  toward  transcending  the  present  approximate
equations, although there is still far to go.

so where do we stand? well, even with the stumbling block of having no fun

ging. although  most  of  the  entries  in  the

calabi-yau catalog yield observable consequences significantly different from our world (different
numbers  of  particle  families,  different  number  and  types  of  fundamental  forces,  among  other
substantial deviations), a few entries in the catalog yield physics that is qualitatively close to what
we  actually  observe.  that  is,  there are  examples  of  calabi-yau  spaces  that,  when  chosen  for  the
curled-up dimensions required by string theory, give rise to string vibrations that are closely akin to
the particles of the standard model. and, of prime importance, string theory successfully stitches the
gravitational force into this quantum-mechanical framework.

with our present level of understanding, this situation is the best we could have hoped for. if
many of the calabi-yau shapes were in rough agreement with experiment, the link between a specific
choice and the physics we observe would be less compelling. many choices cou

hand,  if  none  of  the  calabi-yau  shapes  came  even  remotely  close  to  yielding  observed  physical
properties, it would seem that string theory, although a beautiful theoretical framework, could have no
relevance for our universe. finding a small number of calabi-yau shapes that, with our present, fairly
coarse ability to determine detailed physical implications, appear to be well within the ballpark of
acceptability is an extremely encouraging outcome.

explaining the elementary matter and force particle properties would be among the greatest—if
not the greatest—of scientific achievements. nevertheless, you might ask whethe

superparticles

the theoretical hurdles currently preventing us from extracting detailed string predictions force us to
search  for generic, rather than specific, aspects of a universe consisting of strings. generic in this
context refers to characteristics that are so fundamental to string theory that they are fairly insensitive
to, if not completely independent of, those detailed properties of the theory that are now beyond our
theoretical purview. such characteristics can be discussed with confidence, even with an incomplete
understanding of the full theory. in subsequent chapters we shall return to other examples, but for now
we focus on one: supersymmetry.

as  we  have  discussed,  a  fundamental  property  of  string  theory  is  that  it  is  highly  symmetric,

mathematical extension of these principles, supersymmetry. this means, as discussed in chapter 7,
that patterns of string vibrations come in pairs—superpartner pairs—differing from each other by a
half unit of spin. if string theory is right, then some of the string vibrations will correspond to the
known  elementary  particles.  and  due  to  the  supersymmetric  pairing,  string  theory  makes  the
prediction  that  each  such  known  particle  will  have  a  superpartner.  we  can  determine  the  force
charges that each of these superpartner particles should carry, but we do not currently have the ability
to predict their masses. even so, the prediction that superpartners exist is a generic feature of string
theory;  it  is  a  property  of  string  theory  that  is  true,  independent  of  those  aspects  of  the  theory  we
haven't yet figured out.

s of the known elementary particles have ever been observed. this might mean
that they do not exist and that string theory is wrong. but many particle physicists feel that it means
that  the  superpartners  are  very  heavy  and  are  thus  beyond  our  current  capacity  to  observe

experimentally.  physicists  are  now  constructing  a  mammoth  accelerator  in  geneva,  switzerland,

ought to be discovered before too long. and when that happens, it's going to be dramatic."17

you should bear in mind two things, though. even if superpartner particles are found, this fact
alone will not establish that string theory is correct. as we have seen, although supersymmetry was
discovered by studying string theory, it has also been successfully incorporated into point-particle
theories and is therefore not unique to its stringy origins. conversely, even if superpartner particles
are not found by the large hadron collider, this fact alone will not rule out string theory, since it
might be that the superpartners are so heavy that they are beyond the reach of this machine as well.

having said this, if in fact the superpartner particles are found, it will most definitely be strong

fractionally charged particles

another experimental signature of string theory, having to do with electric charge, is somewhat less
generic  than  superpartner  particles  but  equally  dramatic.  the  elementary  particles  of  the  standard
model have a very limited assortment of electric charges: the quarks and antiquarks have electric
charges of one-third or two-thirds, and their negatives, while the other particles have electric charges
of zero, one, or negative one. combinations of these particles account for all known matter in the
universe.  in  string  the

ory,  however,  it  is  possible  for  there  to  be  resonant  vibrational  patterns
corresponding to particles of significantly different electric charges. for instance, the electric charge
of a particle can take on exotic fractional values such as 1/5, 1/11, 1/13, or 1/53, among a variety of
other  possibilities.  these  unusual  charges  can  arise  if  the  curled-up  dimensions  have  a  certain
geometrical property: holes with the peculiar property that strings encircling them can disentangle
themselves only by wrapping around a specified number of times.18 the details are not particularly
important, but it turns out that the number of windings required to get disentangled manifests itself in
the allowed patterns of vibration by determining the denominator of the fractional charges.

some calabi-yau shapes have this geometrical property while others do not, and for this reason
the possibility of unusual electric-charge fractions is not as generic as

the existence of superpartner
particles. on the other hand, whereas the prediction of superpartners is not a unique property of string
theory, decades of experience have shown that there is no compelling reason for such exotic electric-
charge fractions to exist in any point-particle theory. they can be forced into a point-particle theory,
but doing so would be as natural as the proverbial bull in a china shop. their possible emergence
from simple geometrical properties that the extra dimensions can have makes these unusual electric
charges a natural experimental signature for string theory.

as with the situation with superpa

rtners, no such exotically charged particles have ever been
observed, and our understanding of string theory does not allow for a definitive prediction of their
masses should the extra dimensions have the correct properties to generate them. one explanation for
not seeing them, again, is that if they do exist, their masses must be beyond our present technological
means—in fact, it is likely that their masses would be on the order of the planck mass. but should a
future experiment come across such exotic electric charges, it would constitute very strong evidence
for string theory.

some longe

r shots

there are yet other ways in which evidence for string theory might be found. for example, witten has
pointed out the long-shot possibility that astronomers might one day see a direct signature of string
theory in the data they collect from observing the heavens. as encountered in chapter 6, the size of a
string is typically the planck length, but strings that are more energetic can grow substantially larger.
the energy of the big bang, in fact, would have been high enough to produce a few macroscopically
large  strings  that,  through  cosmic  expansion,  might  have  grown  to  astronomical  scales.  we  can
imagine that now or sometime in the future, a string of this sort might sweep across the night sky,
leaving an unmistakable and measurable imprint on data collected by astronomers (such as a small
shift in the cosmic microwave background

temperature; see chapter 14). as witten says, "although
somewhat fanciful, this is my favorite scenario for confirming string theory as nothing would settle the
issue quite as dramatically as seeing a string in a telescope."19

closer to earth, there are other possible experimental signatures of string theory that have been
put forward. here are five examples. first, in table 1.1 we noted that we do not know if neutrinos
are just very light, or if in fact they are exactly massless. according to the standard model, they are
massless,  but  not  for  any  particularly  deep  reason.  a  challenge  to  string  theory  is  to  provide  a
compelling explanation of present and future neutrino data, especially if experiments ultimately show
that neutrinos do have a tiny but nonzero mass. second, the

re are certain hypothetical processes that
are forbidden by the standard model, but that may be allowed by string theory. among these are the
possible  disintegration  of  the  proton  (don't  worry,  such  disintegration,  if  true,  would  happen  very
slowly) and the possible transmutations and decays of various combinations of quarks, in violation of
certain long-established properties of point-particle quantum field theory.20 these kinds of processes
are  especially  interesting  because  their  absence  from  conventional  theory  makes  them  sensitive
signals  of  physics  that  cannot  be  account

ed  for  without  invoking  new  theoretical  principles.  if
observed,  any  one  of  these  processes  would  provide  fertile  ground  for  string  theory  to  offer  an
explanation. third, for certain choices of the calabi-yau shape there are particular patterns of string
vibration that can effectively contribute new, tiny, long-range force fields. should the effects of any
such  new  forces  be  discovered,  they  might  well  reflect  some  of  the  new  physics  of  string  theory.
fourth,  as  we  note  in  the  next  chapter,  astronomers  have  collected  evidence  that  our  galaxy  and
possibly the whole of the universe is immersed in a bath of dark matter, the identity of which has yet
to be determined. through its many possible patterns of resonant vibration, string theory suggests a
number  of  candidates  for  the  dark  matter;  the  verdict  on  these  candidates  must  await  future
experimental results establishing the detailed properties of the dark

 matter.

and  finally,  a  fifth  possible  means  of  connecting  string  theory  to  observations  involves  the
cosmological  constant—remember,  as  discussed  in  chapter  3,  this  is  the  modification  einstein
temporarily  imposed  on  his  original  equations  of  general  relativity  to  ensure  a  static  universe.
although  the  subsequent  discovery  that  the  universe  is  expanding  led  einstein  to  retract  the
modification,  physicists  have  since  realized  that  there  is  no  explanation  for why  the  cosmological
constant should be zero. 
 
 ___________________________
 
s  and  measurements  lead  to  a  colossal
mismatch:  observations  show  that  the  cosmological  constant  is  either  zero  (as  einstein  ultimately
suggested) or quite small; calculations indicate that quantum-mechanical fluctuations in the vacuum of
empty  space  tend  to generate a nonzero cosmological constant whose value is some 120 orders of

magnitude  (a  1  followed  by  120  zeros)  larger  than  experiment  allows!  this  presents  a  wonderful
challenge  and  opportunity  for  string  theorists:  can  calculations  in  string  theory  improve  on  this
mismatch and explain why the cosmological constant is zero, or if experiments do ultimately establish
that its value is small but nonzero, can string theory provide an explanation? should string theorists be
able to rise to this challenge—as yet they have not—it would provide a compelling piece of evidence
in support of the theory.

an appraisal

the history of physics is filled with ideas that when first presented seemed
 
 ___________________________
 
foreseen developments, were ultimately brought within the realm of experimental
verifiability. the notion that matter is made of atoms, pauli's hypothesis that there are ghostly neutrino
particles, and the possibility that the heavens are dotted with neutron stars and black holes are three
prominent ideas of precisely this sort—ideas that we now embrace fully but that, at their inception,
seemed more like musings of science fiction than aspects of science fact.

the motivation for introducing string theory is at least as compelling as any of these three ideas
—in fact, string theory has been hailed as the most important and exciting development in theoretical
physics since the discovery of quantum mechanics. this comparison is particularly apt because the
history of quantum mechanics teaches us that revolutions in physics can easily take many decades to
reach  maturity.  and  compared  to  today's  string  theorists,  the  physicists  working  out  quantum
mechanics had a great advantage
 
 ___________________________
 
chanics, even when only partially formulated, could
make  direct  contact  with  experimental  results.  even  so,  it  took  close  to  30  years  for  the  logical
structure of quantum mechanics to be worked out, and about another 20 years to incorporate special
relativity fully into the theory. we are now incorporating general relativity, a far more challenging
task, and, moreover, one that makes contact with experiment much more difficult. unlike those who
worked out quantum theory, today's string theorists do not have the shining light of nature—through
detailed experimental results—to guide them from one step to the next.

this  means  that  it's  conceivable  that  one  or  more  generations  of  physicists  will  devote  their
lives to the investigation and development of string theory without getting a shred of experimental
feedback.  the  substantial  number  of  physicists  the  world  over  who  are  vigorously  pursuing  string
theory  know  that  they  are  taking  a  risk:

  that  a  lifetime  of  effort  might  result  in  an  inconclusive
outcome.  undoubtedly,  significant  theoretical  progress  will  continue,  but  will  it  be  sufficient  to
overcome present hurdles and yield definitive, experimentally testable predictions? will the indirect
tests we have discussed above result in a true smoking gun for string theory? these questions are of
central concern to all string theorists, but they are also questions about which nothing can really be
said. only the passage of time will reveal the answers. the beautiful simplicity of string theory, the
way in which it tames the conflict between gravity and quantum mechanics, its ability to unify all of
nature's  ingredients,  and  its  potential  of  limitless  predictive  power  all  serve  to  provide  rich
inspiration that makes the risk worth taking.

these  lofty  considerations  have  been  continually  reinforced

of these are generic features that, regardless of currently unknown details, will be basic properties of
a  universe  built  of  strings.  of  these,  the  most  astonishing  have  had  a  profound  effect  on  our  ever

string theory and the fabric of spacetime

chapter 10

quantum geometry

in  the  course  of  about  a  decade,  einstein  singlehandedly  overthrew  the  centuries-old  newtonian
framework and gave the world a radically new and demonstrably deeper understanding of gravity. it
does  not  take  much  to  get  experts  and  nonexperts  alike  to  gush  over

s.  it  is  riemann's  insights  that  provide  the
mathematics for quantitatively analyzing warped spaces such as those illustrated in figures 3.4 and
3.6.  einstein's  genius  lay  in  recognizing  that  this  body  of  mathematics  was  tailor-made  for
implementing  his  new  view  of  the  gravitational  force.  he  boldly  declared  that  the  mathematics  of
riemann's geometry aligns perfectly with the physics of gravity.

but  now,  almost  a  century  after  einstein's  tour-de-force,  string  theory  gives  us  a  quantum-
mechanical description of gravity that, by necessity, modifies general relativity when the distances
involved become as short as the planck length. since riemannian geometry is the mathematical core
of  general  relativity,  this  means  that  it  too  must  be  modified  in  order  to  reflect  faithfully  the  new
short-distance physics of string theory. whereas general relativity asserts that the curved properties
of the universe are described by riemannian ge

ometry, string theory asserts that this is true only if we
examine the fabric of the universe on large enough scales. on scales as small as the planck length a
new kind of geometry must emerge, one that aligns with the new physics of string theory. this new
geometrical framework is called quantum geometry.

unlike  the  case  of  riemannian  geometry,  there  is  no  ready-made  geometrical  opus  sitting  on
some mathematician's shelf that string theorists can adopt and put in the service of quantum geometry.
instead, physicists and mathematicians are now vigorously studying string theory and, little by little,
piecing  together  a  new  branch  of  physics  and  mathematics.  although  the  full  story  has  yet  to  be
written, these investigations have already uncovered many new geometrical properties of spacetime
entailed by string theory—properties that would almost certainly have thrilled even einstein.

mathematically,  the  curvature  of  spacetime—like  the  curvature  of  the  trampoline—reflects  the
distorted distance relations between its points. physically, the gravitational force felt by an object is
a direct reflection of this distortion. in fact, by making the object smaller and smaller, the physics and
the  mathematics  align  ever  more  precisely  as  we  get  closer  and  closer  to  physically  realizing  the
abstract  mathematical  concept  of  a  point.  but  string  theory  limits  how  precisely  riemann's
geometrical formalism can be realized by the physics of gravity, because there is a limit to how small
we can make any object. once you get down to strings, you can't go any further. the traditional notion
of  a  point  particle  does  not  exist  in  string  theory—an  essential  element  in  its  ability  to  give  us  a
quantum theory of gravity. this concretely shows us that riemann's geometrical framework, which
relies fundamentally upon distanc

theory.

this  observation  has  a  very  small  effect  on  ordinary  macroscopic  applications  of  general
relativity. in cosmological studies, for example, physicists routinely model whole galaxies as if they
are points, since their size, in relation to the whole of the universe, is extremely tiny. for this reason,
implementing riemann's geometrical framework in this crude manner proves to be a very accurate

l context. but in the
ultramicroscopic realm, the extended nature of the string ensures that riemann's geometry simply will
not  be  the  right  mathematical  formalism.  instead,  as  we  will  now  see,  it  must  be  replaced  by  the
quantum geometry of string theory, leading to dramatically new and unexpected properties.

a cosmological playground

according to the big bang model of cosmology, the whole of the universe violently emerged from a
singular  cosmic  explosion,  some  15  or  so  billion  years  ago.  today,  as  originally  discovered  by
hubble, we can see that the "debris" from this explosion, in the form of many billions of galaxies, is
still streaming outward. the universe is expanding. we do not know whether this cosmic growth will

 to the size of a molecule, an atom, and in a final inexorable cosmic crunch to no
size at all. according to conventional theory, the universe began with a bang from an initial state of
zero size, and if it has enough mass, it will end with a crunch to a similar state of ultimate cosmic
compression.

but when the distance scales involved are around the planck length or less, quantum mechanics
invalidates the equations of general relativity, as we are now well aware. we must instead make use
of  string  theory. and  so,  whereas  einstein's  general  relativity  allows  the  geometrical  form  of  the
universe  to  get  arbitrarily  small—in  exactly  the  same  way  that  the  mathematics  of  riemannian
geometry allows an abstract shape to take on as small a size as the intellect can imagine—we are led
to  ask  how  string  theory  modifies  the  picture. as  we  shall  now  see,  there  is  evidence  that  string

ales and, in a remarkably
novel way, proclaims that the universe cannot be squeezed to a size shorter than the planck length in
any of its spatial dimensions.

based on the familiarity you now have with string theory, you might be tempted to hazard a guess
as to how this comes about. after all, you might argue that no matter how many points you pile up on
top of each other—point particles that is—their combined volume is still zero. by contrast, if these
particles are really strings, collapsed together in completely random orientations, they will fill out a
nonzero-sized  blob,  roughly  like  a  planck-sized  ball  of  entangled  rubber  bands.  if  you  made  this
argument, you would be on the right track, but you would be missing significant, subtle features that
string theory elegantly employs to suggest a minimum size to the universe. these features serve to
emphasize, in a concrete manner, the new stringy physics that comes into play and its resultant impact
on the

geometry of spacetime.

to explain these important aspects, let's first call upon an example that pares away extraneous
details without sacrificing the new physics. instead of considering all ten of the spacetime dimensions
of string theory—or even the four extended spacetime dimensions we are familiar with—let's go back
to  the  garden-hose  universe.  we  originally  introduced  this  two-spatial-dimension  universe  in
chapter 8 in a prestring context to explain aspects of kaluza's and klein's insights in the 1920s. let's
now  use  it  as  a  "cosmological  playground"  to  explore  the  properties  of  string  theory  in  a  simple
setting;  we  will  shortly  use  the  insights  we  gain  to  better  understand  all  of  the  spatial  dimensions
string theory requires. toward this end, we imagine that the circular dimension of the garden-hose
universe starts out nice and plump but then shrinks to shorter and shorter size, approachi

lineland—a simplified, partial version of the big crunch.

the  question  we  seek  to  answer  is  whether  the  geometrical  and  physical  properties  of  this
cosmic collapse have features that markedly differ between a universe based on strings and one based
on point particles.

the essential new feature

we do not have to search far to find the essential new string physics. a point particle moving in this
two-dimensional  universe  can  execute  the  kinds  of  motion  illustrated  in  figure  10.2:  it  can  move
along the extended dimension of the garden-hose, it can move along the curled-up part of the garden-
hose, or any combination of the two. a loop of string can undergo similar motion, with one difference
being  that  it  oscillates  as  it  moves  around  on  the  surface,  as  shown  in  figure  10.3(a).  this  is  a
distinction  we  have  alrea

dy  discussed  in  some  detail:  the  oscillations  of  the  string  imbue  it  with

characteristics such as mass and force charges. although a crucial aspect of string theory, this is not
our present focus, since we already understand its physical implications.

instead, our present interest is in another difference between point-particle and string motion, a
difference directly dependent on the shape of the space through which the string is moving. since the
string is an extended object, there is another possible configuration beyond those already mentioned:
it can wrap around—lasso, so to speak—the circular part of the garden-hose universe, as shown in
figure  10.3(b).1  the  string  will  continue  to  slide  around  and  oscillate,  but  it  will  do  so  in  this
extended configuration. in fact, the string can wrap around the circular part of the space any number of
times, as also shown in figure 10.3(b), and again will execute oscillatory motion

as it slides around.
when  a  string  is  in  such  a  wrapped  configuration,  we  say  that  it  is  in  a winding mode  of  motion.
clearly,  being  in  a  winding  mode  is  a  possibility  inherent  to  strings.  there  is  no  point-particle
counterpart.  we  now  seek  to  understand  the  implications  of  this  qualitatively  new  kind  of  string
motion on the string itself as well as on the geometrical properties of the dimension it wraps.

figure 10.3 strings can move on a cylinder in two different ways—in "unwrapped" or "wrapped"
configurations.

the physics of wound strings

throughout our previous discussion of string motion, we have focused on unwound strings. strings
that wrap around a circular component of space share almost all of the same properties as the strings
we have studied. their oscillat
 
 ___________________________
 
ions, just as those of their unwound counterparts, contribute strongly to
their  observed  properties.  the  essential  difference  is  that  a  wrapped  string  has  a minimum  mass,
determined by the size of the circular dimension and the number of times it wraps around. the string's
oscillatory motion determines a contribution in excess of this minimum.

it is not difficult to understand the origin of this minimum mass. a wound string has a minimum
length determined by the circumference of the circular dimension and the number of times the string
encircles it. the minimum length of a string determines its minimum mass: the longer this length, the
greater the mass, since there is more of it. since the circumference of a circle is proportional to its
radius, the minimum winding-mode masses are proportional to the radius of the circle being wrapped.
by using einstein's e = mc2 relating mass to energy, we can also say that the e

string is proportional to the radius of the circular dimension. (unwrapped strings also have a tiny
minimum  length  since  if  they  didn't,  we  would  be  back  in  the  realm  of  point  particles.  the  same
reasoning  might  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  even  unwrapped  strings  have  a  minuscule  yet  nonzero
minimum mass. in a sense this is true, but the quantum-mechanical effects encountered in chapter 6—
remember the price is right, again—are able to exactly cancel this contribution to the mass. this is
how, we recall, unwrapped strings can yield the zero-mass photon, graviton, and the other massless
or near-massless particles, for example. wrapped strings are different in this regard.)

how does the existence of wrapped string configurations affect the geom

etrical properties of the
dimension  around  which  the  strings  wind?  the  answer,  first  recognized  in  1984  by  the  japanese
physicists keiji kikkawa and masami yamasaki, is bizarre and remarkable.

let's consider the last cataclysmic stages of our variant on the big crunch in the garden-hose
universe. as  the  radius  of  the  circular  dimension  shrinks  to  the  planck  length  and,  in  the  mold  of
general  relativity,  continues  to  shrink  to  yet  smaller  lengths,  string  theory  insists  upon  a  radical
reinterpretation  of  what  actually  happens.  string  theory  claims  that all  physical  processes  in  the
garden-hose universe in which the radius of the circular dimension is shorter than the planck length
and is decreasing are absolutely identical to physical processes in which the circular dimension is
longer  than  the  planck  length  and  increasing!  this  means  that  as  the  circular  dimension  tries  to
collapse through the planck length and h
 
 ___________________________
 
ead toward ever smaller size, its attempts are made futile by
string  theory,  which  turns  the  tables  on  geometry.  string  theory  shows  that  this  evolution  can  be
rephrased—exactly reinterpreted—as the circular dimension shrinking down to the planck length and
then proceeding to expand. string theory rewrites the laws of short-distance geometry so that what
previously appeared to be complete cosmic collapse is now seen to be a cosmic bounce. the circular
dimension  can  shrink  to  the  planck-length.  but  because  of  the  winding  modes,  attempts  to  shrink
further actually result in expansion. let's see why.

the spectrum of string states*

the new possibility of wound-string configurations implies that the energy of a string in the garden-
hose universe comes from two sources:
 
 ___________________________
 
 vibrational motion and winding energy. from the legacy of
kaluza and klein, each depends on the geometry of the hose, that is, on the radius of its curled-up
circular  component,  but  with  a  distinctly  stringy  twist,  since  point  particles  cannot  wrap  around
dimensions.  our  first  task,  then,  will  be  to  determine  precisely  how  the  winding  and  vibrational
contributions to the energy of a string depend on the size of the circular dimension. for this purpose,
it proves convenient to separate the vibrational motion of strings into two categories: uniform  and
ordinary vibrations. ordinary vibrations refer to the usual oscillations we have discussed repeatedly,
such as those illustrated in figure 6.2; uniform vibrations refer to even simpler motion: the overall
motion of string as it slides from one position to another without changing its shape. all string motion
is a combination of slid
 
 ___________________________
 
ing and oscillating—of uniform and ordinary vibrations—but for the present
discussion it is easier to separate them in this manner. in fact, the ordinary vibrations will not play a
central part in our reasoning, and we will therefore include their effects only after we have finished
giving the gist of the argument.

here are the two essential observations. first, uniform vibrational excitations of a string have
energies  that  are inversely  proportional  to  the  radius  of  the  circular  dimension.  this  is  a  direct
consequence of the quantum-mechanical uncertainty principle: a smaller radius more strictly confines

a string and therefore, through quantum-mechanical claustrophobia, increases the amount of energy in
its motion. so, as the radius of the circular dimension decreases, the energy of motion of the string
necessarily  increases—the  hallmark  feature  of  an  inverse  proportio

nality.  second,  as  found  in  the
preceding  section,  the  winding  mode  energies  are directly—not  inversely—proportional  to  the
radius. remember, this is because the minimum length of wound strings, and hence their minimum
energy, is proportional to the radius. these two observations establish that large values of the radius
imply large winding energies and small vibration energies, whereas small values of the radius imply
small winding energies and large vibration energies.

this leads us to the key fact: for any large circular radius of the garden-hose universe, there is
a corresponding small circular radius for which the winding energies of strings in the former universe
equal the vib
 
 ___________________________
 
ration energies of strings in the latter, and vibration energies of strings in the former
equal winding energies of strings in the latter. as physical properties are sensitive to the total energy
of  a  string  configuration—and  not  to  how  the  energy  is  divided  between  vibration  and  winding
contributions—there  is no physical distinction  between  these geometrically distinct  forms  for  the
garden-hose  universe.  and  so,  strangely  enough,  string  theory  claims  that  there  is  no  difference
whatsoever between a "fat" garden-hose universe and a "thin" one.

it's a cosmic hedging of bets, somewhat akin to what you, as a smart investor, should do if faced
with the following puzzle. imagine you learn that the fate of two stocks trading on wall street—say, a
company  making  fitness  machines  and  a  company  making  heart-bypass  valves—are  inextricably
connected.  they  each  closed  trading  today  valued  at  one  dollar  per  
 
 ___________________________
 
ss company closes at $4 and the
heart-valve  company  closes  at  $1/4  (25  cents),  their  combined  value  is  $4.25  (for  each  pair  of
shares), compared with $2 the previous day. furthermore, from the perspective of net worth, it does
not matter one bit whether the fitness company closes high and the heart-valve company low, or vice
versa.  if  you  care  only  about  the  total  amount  of  money,  these  two  distinct  circumstances  are
financially indistinguishable.

the situation in string theory is analogous in that the energy in string configurations comes from
two  sources—vibrations  and  windings—whose  contributions  to  the  total  energy  of  a  string  are
generally different. but, as we shall see in more detail below, certain pairs of distinct geometrical
circumstances—leading  to  high-winding-energy/low-vibration-energy  or  low-winding-energy/high-
vibration-energy—are physically  indistinguishable.  and,  unlike  the  financial  analogy  for  which
considera
 
 ___________________________
 
tions beyond total wealth can distinguish between the two types of stock holdings, there is
absolutely no physical distinction between the two string scenarios.

actually, we shall see that to make the analogy with string theory tighter, we should consider

what would happen if you did not divide your money equally between the two companies in your
initial investment, but bought, say, 1,000 shares of the fitness company and 3,000 shares of the heart-
valve company. now the total value of your holdings does depend on which company closes high and
which closes low. for instance, if the stocks close at $10 (fitness) and 10 cents (heart-valve), your
initial investment of $4,000 will now be worth $10,300. if the rev
 
 ___________________________
 
cks  close  valves-high/fitness-low  (the  same  as  your  holdings  in  the  fitness-high/valves-low
closing) and $30,100 if they close with fitness-high/valves-low (again, the same as your holdings in
the  reciprocal  situation).  that  is,  from  the  point  of  view  of  total  stock  value,  interchanging  which
stock closes high and which closes low is exactly compensated by interchanging the number of shares
you own of each company.

hold this last observation in mind as we now return to string theory and think about the possible
string energies in a specific example. imagine that the radius of the circular garden-hose dimension
is,  say,  ten  times  the  planck  length.  we  will  write  this  as  r  =  10. a  string  can  wrap  around  this
circular dimension one time, two times, three times, and so forth. the number of times a string wraps
around  the  circular  dimension  is  called  its winding  number.  the  energy  from  winding,  being
determined by the length of wound string
 
 ___________________________
 
, is proportional to the product of the radius and the winding
number. additionally, for any amount of winding, the string can undergo vibrational motion. as the
uniform  vibrations  we  are  currently  focusing  on  have  energies  that  are  inversely  dependent  on  the
radius, they are proportional to whole-number multiples of the reciprocal of the radius—1/r—which
in  this  case  is  one-tenth  of  the  planck  length.  we  call  this  whole  number  multiple  the vibration
number.2

as you can see, this situation is very similar to what we encountered on wall street, with the
winding and vibration numbers
 
 ___________________________
 
 being direct analogs of the shares held in the two companies, while r
and 1/r are the analogs of the closing prices per share in each. now, just as you can easily calculate
the total value of your investment from the number of shares held in each company and the closing
prices,  we  can  calculate  the  total  energy  carried  by  a  string  in  terms  of  its  vibration  number,  its
winding number, and the radius. in table 10.1 we give a partial list of these total energies for various
string configurations, which we specify by their winding and vibration numbers, in a garden-hose
universe with radius r = 10.

a complete table would be infinitely long, since the winding and vibration numbers can take on
arbitrary  whole-number  values,  but  this  representative  piece  of  the  table  is  adequate  for  our
discussion.  we  see  from  the  table  and  our  remarks  that  we  are  in  a  high-winding-energy/low-
vibration-energy  situation:  winding  energies  come  in  multiples  o
 
 ___________________________
 
f  10,  while  vibrational  energies
come in multiples of the smaller number 1/10.

now imagine that the radius of the circular dimension shrinks, say, from 10 to 9.2 to 7.1 and on
down to 3.4, 2.2, 1.1, .7, all the way to .1 (1/10), where, for our present discussion, it stops. in this
geometrically distinct form of the garden-hose universe we can compile an analogous table of string
energies: winding energies are now multiples of 1/10 while vibration energies are multiples of its
reciprocal, 10. the results are shown in table 10.2.

at first glance, the two tables might appear to be different. but closer inspection reveals that
although  arranged  in  a  different  order,  the  "total  energy"  columns  of  both  tables  have identical

entries.  to  find  the  corresponding  entry  in  table  10.2  for  a  chosen  entry  in  table  10.1,  one  must
simply interchange the
 
 ___________________________
 
 vibration and winding numbers. that is, vibration and winding contributions
play complementary roles when the radius of the circular dimension changes from 10 to 1/10. and so,
as far as total string energies go, there is no distinction between these different sizes for the circular
dimension. just as the interchange of fitness-high/valves-low with valves-high/fitness-low is exactly
compensated by an interchange of the number of shares held in each company, interchange of radius
10  and  radius  1/10  is  exactly  compensated  by  the  interchange  of  vibration  and  winding  numbers.
moreover,  while  for  simplicity  we  have  focused  on  an  initial  radius  of r = 10 and its reciproca

table 10.2 as in table 10.1, except that the radius is now taken to be 1/10.

tables 10.1 and 10.2 are incomplete for two reasons. first, as mentioned, we have listed only a
few  of  the  infinite  possibilities  for  winding/vibration  numbers  that  a  string  can  assume.  this,  of
course, poses no problem—we could make the tables as long as our patience allows and would find
that the relation between them will continue to hold. second, beyond winding energy, we have so far
considered  only  energy  contributions  arising  from  the  uniform-vibrational  motion  of  a  string.  we
should now include the ordinary vibrations as well, since these give additional contributions to the
string's total energy and also determine the force charges it carr

ies. the important point, however, is
that  investigations  have  revealed  that  these  contributions  do  not  depend  on  the  size  of  the  radius.
thus, even if we were to include these more detailed features of string attributes in tables 10.1 and
10.2,  the  tables  would  still  correspond  exactly,  since  the  ordinary  vibrational  contributions  affect
each  table  identically.  we  therefore  conclude  that  the  masses  and  the  charges  of  particles  in  a
garden-hose universe with radius r are completely identical to those in a garden-hose universe with
radius 1/r. and since these masses and force charges govern fundamental physics, there is no way to

ssors in the garden-hose universe. after setting up their competing laboratories, each
claims  to  have  determined  the  size  of  the  circular  dimension.  surprisingly,  although  each  has  a
reputation  for  carrying  out  research  with  great  precision,  their  conclusions  do  not  agree.  george
claims that the circular radius is r = 10 times the planck length, while gracie claims that the circular
radius is r = 1/10 times the planck length.

"gracie,"  says  george,  "based  on  my  string  theory  calculations,  i  know  that  if  the  circular

dimension has radius 10, then i should expect to see strings whose energies are listed in table 10.1. i
have done extensive experiments using the new planck energy accelerator and they have revealed that
this prediction is precisely confirmed. therefore, with confidence, i claim that the circular dimension
has radius r = 10." gracie, in defense of her claims, makes exactly the same remarks except for her
conclusion that the list of ener
 
 ___________________________
 
gies in table 10.2 is found, confirming that the radius is r = 1/10.

in a flash of insight, gracie shows george that the two tables, although arranged differently, are
actually  identical.  now  george,  who,  as  is  well  known,  reasons  a  bit  more  slowly  than  gracie,
replies, "how can this be? i know that different values for the radius give rise, through basic quantum
mechanics and the properties of wound strings, to different possible values for string energies and
string charges. if we agree on the latter, then we must agree on the radius."

gracie, using her newfound insight into string physics replies, "what you say is almost, but not
quite, correct. it is usually true that two different values for the radius give rise to different allowed
energies.  however,  in  the  special  circumstance  when  the  two  values  for  the  radius  are  inversely
related  to  one  another—like  10  and  1/10—then  the  allowed  energies  and  charges  are  actually

ical. you see, what you would call a winding mode i would call a vibration mode, and what you
would  call  a  vibration  mode  i  would  call  a  winding  mode.  but  nature  does  not  care  about  the
language we use. instead, physics is governed by the properties of the fundamental ingredients—the
particle masses (energies) and the force charges they carry. and whether the radius is r or 1/r, the
complete list of these properties for the fundamental ingredients in string theory is identical."

in  a  moment  of  bold  comprehension,  george  responds,  "i  think  i  understand.  although  the
detailed description you and i might give for strings may differ—whether they are wound around the
circular  dimension,  or  the  particulars  of  their  vibrational  behavior—the  complete  list  of  physical
characteristics they can attain is the same. therefore, since the physical properties of the universe
depend upon these properties of the basic constituents, the

three questions

at this point you might say, "look, if i was a little being in the garden-hose universe i would simply
measure the circumference of the hose with a tape measure and thereby unambiguously determine the
radius—no ifs, ands, or buts. so what is this nonsense about two indistinguishable possibilities with
different radii? furthermore, doesn't string theory do away with sub-planck distances, so why are we
even talking about circular dimensions with radii that are a fraction of the planck length? and finally,
while we are at it, who really cares about the two-dimensional garden-hose universe—what does all
this add up to when we include all dimensions?"

let's begin with the last question, as the answer will force us to come face to face with the first

two.

although our discussion has taken place in the garden-hose universe, we restricted

 of an enormous circle,
beyond  the  visual  sensitivity  of  state-of-the-art  telescopes.  if  the  latter  is  the  case,  an  astronaut
travelling out into space, continuously going in a fixed direction, would ultimately circle around the
universe—like magellan travelling around the earth—and wind up back at the initial starting point.

the familiar extended dimensions, therefore, may very well also be in the shape of circles and
hence subject to the r and 1/r physical identification of string theory. to put some rough numbers in,
if the familiar dimensions are circular then their radii must be about as large as the 15 billion light-
years mentioned above, which is about ten trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion (r=1061) times the
planck  length,  and  growing  as  the  universe  expands.  if  string  theory  is  right,  this  is  physically
identical to the familiar dimensions being circular with incredibly tiny radii of about 1/r=1/1061 =
10-61  times  the  planck  length! t

getting ever smaller as time goes by, since as r grows, 1/r shrinks. now we seem to have really gone
off the deep end. how can this possibly be true? how can a six-foot tall human being "fit" inside such
an unbelievably microscopic universe? how can such a speck of a universe be physically identical to
the great expanse we view in the heavens? furthermore, we are now led forcefully to the second of
our initial three
 
 ___________________________
 
 questions: string theory was supposed to eliminate the ability to probe sub-planck
distances. but if a circular dimension has radius r whose length is larger than the planck length, its
reciprocal 1/r is necessarily a fraction of the planck length. so what is going on? the answer, which
will also address the first of our three questions, highlights an important and subtle aspect of space
and distance.

two interrelated notions of distance in string theory

distance is such a basic concept in our understanding of the world that it is easy to underestimate the
depth of its subtlety. with the surprising effects that special and general relativity have had on our
notions of space and time, and the new features arising from string theory, we are led to be a bit more
careful even in our definition of distance. the most meaningful definitions in physics are those that
are  operational—that  is,  definitions  that  provide  a  means,  at  least
 
 ___________________________
 
  in  principle,  for  measuring
whatever  is  being  defined. after  all,  no  matter  how  abstract  a  concept  is,  having  an  operational
definition allows us to boil down its meaning to an experimental procedure for measuring its value.

how  can  we  give  an  operational  definition  of  the  concept  of  distance?  the  answer  to  this
question  in  the  context  of  string  theory  is  rather  surprising.  in  1988,  the  physicists  robert
brandenberger of brown university and cumrun vafa of harvard university pointed out that if the
spatial shape of a dimension is circular, there are two different yet related operational definitions of
distance in string theory. each lays out a distinct experimental procedure for measuring distance and
is based, roughly speaking, on the simple principle that if a probe travels at a fixed and known speed
then we can measure a gi
 
 ___________________________
 
ven distance by determining how long the probe takes to traverse it. the
difference between the two procedures is the choice of probe used. the first definition uses strings
that  are not wound around a circular dimension, whereas the second definition uses strings that are
wound. we see that the extended nature of the fundamental probe is responsible for there being two
natural operational definitions of distance in string theory. in a point-particle theory, for which there

is no notion of winding, there would be only one such definition.

how do the results of each procedure differ? the answer found by brandenberger and vafa is as
surprising as it is subtle. the rough idea underlying the result can be understood by appealing to the
uncertainty principle. unwound strings can move around freely and probe the full circumference of
the circle, a length proportional to r. by the uncertainty principle, their energie
 
 ___________________________
 
s are proportional to
1/r (recall from chapter 6 the inverse relation between the energy of a probe and the distances to
which  it  is  sensitive).  on  the  other  hand,  we  have  seen  that  wound  strings  have  minimum  energy
proportional  to r;  as  probes  of  distances  the  uncertainty  principle  tells  us  that  they  are  therefore
sensitive to the reciprocal of this value, 1/r. the mathematical embodiment of this idea shows that if
each  is  used  to  measure  the  radius  of  a  circular  dimension  of  space,  unwound  string  probes  will
measure r while wound strings will measure 1/r, where, as before, we are measuring distances in
multiples of the planck length. the result of eac

h experiment has an equal claim to being the radius of
the circle—what we learn from string theory is that using different probes to measure distance can
result in different answers. in fact, this property extends to all measurements of lengths and distances,
not just to determining the size of a circular dimension. the results obtained by wound and unwound
string probes will be inversely related to one another.4

if string theory describes our universe, why have we not encountered these two possible notions
of distance in any of our day-to-day or scientific endeavors? any time we talk about distance, we do
so in a manner that conforms to our experience of there being one concept of distance without any hint
of there being a second notion. why have we missed the alternative possibility? the answer is that
although there is a high degree of symmetry in our discussion, whenever r (and hence 1/r as well)
differ  sign
 
 ___________________________
 
 (and
hence 1/r as well) differs significantly from the planck length (that is, r = 1). "high" energy here, for
radii  that  are  vastly  different  from  the  planck  length,  corresponds  to  incredibly  massive  probes—
billions and billions of times heavier than the proton, for instance—while "low" energy corresponds
to probe masses at most a speck above zero. in such circumstances, there is a monumental difference
in difficulty between the two approaches, since even producing the heavy-string configurations is an
undertaking that, at present, is beyond our technological prowess. in practice, then, only one of the
two approaches is technologically feasible—the one involving the lighter of the two types of string
configurations.  this  is  the  one  used  implicitly  in  all  of  our  discussions  involving  distance
encountered to this point. this is the one that informs and hence meshes with our intuition.

putting  issues  of  practicality  aside,  in  a  universe  governed  by  
 
 ___________________________
 
string  theory  one  is  free  to
measure  distances  using  either  of  the  two  approaches.  when  astronomers  measure  the  "size  of  the
universe" they do so by examining photons that have traveled across the cosmos and have happened to
enter their telescopes. no pun intended, photons are the light string modes in this situation. the result
obtained is the 1061 times the planck length quoted earlier. if the three familiar spatial dimensions are
in fact circular and string theory is right, astronomers using vastly different (and currently nonexistent)
equipment, in principle, should be able to measure the extent of the heavens with heavy wound-string
modes and find a result that is the reciprocal of this huge distance. it is in this sense that we can think
of the universe as being either huge, as we normally do, or terribly minute. according to the light

string  modes,  the  universe  is  large  and  expanding;  according  to  the  heavy  modes  it  is  tiny  a

contracting.  there  is  no  contradiction  here;  instead,  we  have  two  distinct  but  equally  sensible
definitions  of  distance.  we  are  far  more  familiar  with  the  first  definition  due  to  technological
limitations, but, nevertheless, each is an equally valid concept.

now  we  can  answer  our  earlier  question  about  big  humans  in  a  little  universe.  when  we
measure  the  height  of  a  human  and  find  six  feet,  for  instance,  we  necessarily  use  the  light  string
modes. to compare their size to that of the universe, we must use the same measuring procedure and,
as above, this yields 15 billion light-years for the size of the universe, a result that is much larger than
six feet. asking how such a person can fit into the "tiny" universe as measured by the heavy string
modes is asking a meaningless question—it's comparing apples and oranges. since we now have two
concepts of distance—using light or heavy string probes—we must compare measurements mad

the same manner.

a minimum size

it's been a bit of a trek, but we are now set for the key point. if one does stick to measuring distances
"the easy way"—that is, using the lightest of the string modes instead of the heavy ones—the results
obtained will always be larger than the planck length. to see this, let's think through the hypothetical
big crunch for the three extended dimensions, assuming them to be circular. for argument's sake, let's
say that at the beginning of our thought experiment, unwound string modes are the light ones and by
using them it is determined that the universe has an enormously large radius and that it is shrinking in
time. as it shrinks, these unwound modes

ld the same result since 1 is its own reciprocal.

as the radius continues to shrink, the winding modes become lighter than the unwound modes
and hence, since we are always opting for the "easier approach," they should now be used to measure
distances. according to this method of measurement, which yields the reciprocal of that measured by
the  unwound  modes, the radius is larger than one times the planck length and increasing.  this
simply reflects that as r—the quantity measured by unwound strings—shrinks to 1 and continues to
get smaller, 1/r—the quantity measured by wound strings—grows to 1 and gets larger. therefore, if
one takes care to always use the light string modes—the "easy" approach to measuring distance—the
minimal value encountered is the planck length.

in  particular,  a  big  crunch  to  zero  size  is  avoided,  as  the  radius  of  the  universe  as  measured
using light string-mode probes is always larger than the planck length. rather than heading through t

he
planck length on to ever smaller size, the radius, as measured by the lightest string modes, decreases
to the planck length and then immediately starts to increase. the crunch is replaced by a bounce.

using light string modes to measure distances aligns with our conventional notion of length—the
one  that  was  around  long  before  the  discovery  of  string  theory.  it  is  according  to this  notion  of
distance, as seen in chapter 5, that we encountered insurmountable problems with violent quantum
undulations  if  sub-planck-scale  distances  play  a  physical  role.  we  once  again  see,  from  this
complementary perspective, that the ultra-short distances are avoided by string theory. in the physical
framework  of  general  relativity  and  in  the  corresponding  mathematical  framework  of  riemannian
geometry  there  is  a  single  concep

t  of  distance,  and  it  can  acquire  arbitrarily  small  values.  in  the

physical framework of string theory, and, correspondingly, in the realm of the emerging discipline of
quantum geometry, there are two notions of distance. by judiciously making use of both we find a
concept  of  distance  that  meshes  with  both  our  intuition  and  with  general  relativity  when  distance
scales are large, but that differs from them dramatically when distance scales get small. specifically,
sub-planck-scale distances are inaccessible.

as this discussion is quite subtle, let's re-emphasize one central

" approaches to measuring length and, say, continue to use the
unwound modes as r shrinks through the planck length, it might seem that we would indeed be able to
encounter a sub-planck-length distance. but the paragraphs above inform us that the word "distance"
in the last sentence must be carefully interpreted, since it can have two different meanings, only one of
which conforms to our traditional notion. and in this case, when r shrinks to sub-planck length but
we continue to use the unwound strings (even though they have now become heavier than the wound
strings),  we  are  employing  the  "hard"  approach  to  measuring  distance,  and  hence  the  meaning  of
"distance" does not conform to our standard usage. however, the discussion is far more than one of
semantics  or  even  of  convenience  or  practicality  of  measurement.  even  if  we  choose  to  use  the
nonstandard notion of distance and thereby describe the radius as being shorter than the planck length,

do not involve a zero-
size universe, but rather one that is planck-length in all dimensions. this is certainly a very appealing
proposal for avoiding the mathematical, physical, and logical conundrums of a universe that emanates
from  or  collapses  to  an  infinitely  dense  point. although  it  is  conceptually  difficult  to  imagine  the
whole of the universe compressed together into a tiny planck-sized nugget, it is truly beyond the pale
to imagine it crushed to a point of no size at all. string cosmology, as we shall discuss in chapter 14,
is a field very much in its infancy but one that holds great promise, and may very well provide us with
this easier-to-swallow alternative to the standard big bang model.

how general is this conclusion?

what  if  the  spatial  dimensions  are  not  circular  in  shape?  do  these  remarkable  conclusions  about
minimum spatial extent in string theory still hold? no one knows for sure. the essential aspect of
circular  dimensions  is  that  they  p

ermit  the  possibility  of  wound  strings.  as  long  as  the  spatial
dimensions—regardless of the details of their shape—allow strings to wind around them, most of the
conclusions  we  have  drawn  should  still  apply.  but  what  if,  say,  two  of  the  dimensions  are  in  the
shape of a sphere? in this case, strings cannot get "trapped" in a wound configuration, because they
can always "slip off" much as a stretched rubber band can pop off a basketball. does string theory
nevertheless limit the size to which these dimensions can shrink?

numerous  investigations  seem  to  show  that  the  answer  depends  on  whether  a  full  spatial
dimension is being shrunk (as in the examples in this chapter) or (as we shall encounter and explain in
chapters  11  and  13)  an  isolated  "chunk"  of  space  is  collapsing.  the  general  belief  among  string
theorists is that, regardless of shape, there is a minimum limiting size, much as in the case of circular

mensions, so long as we are shrinking a full spatial dimension. establishing this expectation is an
important goal for further research because it has a direct impact on a number of aspects of string
theory, including its implications for cosmology.

mirror symmetry

through general relativity, einstein forged a link between the physics of gravity and the geometry of
spacetime.  at  first  blush,  string  theory  strengthens  and  broadens  the  link  between  physics  and
geometry, since the properties of vibrating strings—their mass and the force charges they carry—are
largely determined by the properties of the curled-up component of space. we have just seen, though,
that  quantum  geometry—the  geometry-physics  association  in  string  theory—has  some  surprising
twists. in general relativity, and in "conventional" geometry, a circle of radius r is different from one
whose radius 
 
 ___________________________
 
is 1/r, pure and simple; yet, in string theory they are physically indistinguishable. this
leads us to be bold enough to go further and ask whether there might be geometrical forms of space
that differ in more drastic ways—not just in overall size, but possibly also in shape—but that are
nevertheless physically indistinguishable in string theory.

in 1988, lance dixon of the stanford linear accelerator center made a pivotal observation in
this regard that was further amplified by wolfgang lerche of cern, vafa at harvard, and nicholas
warner, then of the massachusetts institute of technology. based upon aesthetic arguments rooted in
considerations of symmetry, these physicists made the audacious suggestion that it might be possible
for two different calabi-yau shapes, chosen for the extra curled-up dimensions in string theory, to

give rise to identical physics.

to give you an idea of how this rather far-fetched possibility might actually occur, recall that the
number of holes in the extra calabi-yau dimensions determines the number of families into which
string excitations will arrange themselves. these holes are analogous to the holes one finds in a torus
or its multihandled cousins, as illustrated in figure 9.1. one deficiency of the two-dimensional figure
that we must show on the printed page is that it cannot show that a six-dimensional calabi-yau space
can  have  holes  of  a  variety  of  dimensions. although  such  holes  are  harder  to  picture,  they  can  be
described with well-understood mathematics. a key fact is that the number of famili

es of particles
arising from string vibrations is sensitive only to the total number of holes, not to the number of holes
of each particular dimension (that's why, for instance, we did not worry about drawing distinctions
between the different types of holes in our discussion in chapter 9). imagine, then, two calabi-yau
spaces in which the number of holes in various dimensions differs, but in which the total number of
holes is the same. since the number of holes in each dimension is not the same, the two calabi-yaus

 of families. this, of course, is but one physical property. agreement on all physical
properties is a far more restrictive requirement, but this at least gives the flavor of how the dixon-
lerche-vafa-warner conjecture could possibly be true.

in the fall of 1987, i joined the physics department at harvard as a postdoctoral fellow and my
office was just down the hall from vafa's. as my thesis research had focused on the physical and
mathematical properties of curled-up calabi-yau dimensions in string theory, vafa kept me closely
apprised of his work in this area. when he stopped by my office in the fall of 1988 and told me of the
conjecture that he, lerche, and warner had come upon, i was intrigued but also skeptical. the intrigue
arose from the realization that if their conjecture was true, it might open a new avenue of research on

string  theory;  the  skepticism  arose  from  the  realization  that  guesses  are  one  thing,  established
properties of a theory are quite another.

ifolding,  which  was  pioneered  by  dixon,  jeffrey
harvey of the university of chicago, vafa, and witten in the mid-1980s. roughly speaking, this is a
procedure in which different points on an initial calabi-yau shape are glued together according to
mathematical  rules  that  ensure  that  a  new  calabi-yau  shape  is  produced.  this  is  schematically
illustrated in figure 10.4. the mathematics underlying the manipulations illustrated in figure 10.4 is
formidable,  and  for  this  reason  string  theorists  had  thoroughly  investigated  this  procedure  only  as
applied  to  the  simplest  of  shapes—higher-dimensional  versions  of  the  doughnut  shapes  shown  in
figure 9.1. plesser and i realized, though, that some beautiful new insights of doron gepner, then of
princeton  university,  might  give  a  powerful  theoretical  framework  for  applying  the  orbifolding
technique to full-fledged calabi-yau shapes, such as the one in figure 8.9.

mirror  pair  of  calabi-yau  spaces  are  not  literally  mirror  images  of  one  another,  in  the  sense  of
everyday usage. but even though they have different geometrical properties, they give rise to one and
the same physical universe when used for the extra dimensions in string theory.

the weeks after finding this result were an extremely anxious time. plesser and i knew that we
were  sitting  on  an  important  new  piece  of  string  physics.  we  had  shown  that  the  tight  association
between geometry and physics originally set down by einstein was substantially modified by string
theory:  drastically  different  geometrical  shapes  that  would  imply  different  physical  properties  in
general relativity were giving rise to identical physics in string theory

erchange of the number of even and odd holes. i told him that i was still seated—
that plesser and i had found the same result. candelas's and our work turned out to be complementary;
we  had  gone  one  step  further  by  showing  that  all  of  the  resulting  physics  in  a  mirror  pair  was
identical, whereas candelas and his students had shown that a significantly larger sample of calabi-
yau shapes fell into mirror pairs. through the two papers, we had discovered the mirror symmetry
of string theory.7

the physics and the mathematics of mirror symmetry

the loosening of einstein's rigid and unique association between the geometry of space and observed
physics is one of the striking paradigm shifts of string theory. but these developments entail far more
than a change in philosophical stance. mirror symmetry, in particular, provides a powerful tool for
understanding both the physics of string theory and the mathematics of calabi-yau spaces.

led  algebraic  geometry  had  been  studying  calabi-yau
spaces for purely mathematical reasons long before string theory was discovered. they had worked
out many of the detailed properties of these geometrical spaces without an inkling of a future physical
application.  certain  aspects  of  calabi-yau  spaces,  however,  had  proven  difficult—essentially
impossible—for  mathematicians  to  unravel  fully.  but  the  discovery  of  mirror  symmetry  in  string

theory  changed  this  significantly.  in  essence,  mirror  symmetry  proclaims  that  particular  pairs  of
calabi-yau spaces, pairs that were previously thought to be completely unrelated, are now intimately
connected by string theory. they are linked by the common physical universe each implies if either is
the  one  selected  for  the  extra  curled-up  dimensions.  this  previously  unsuspected  interconnection
provides an incisive new physical and mathematical tool.

stead, you are working through a thought experiment concerned with what the world would look like
if a particular calabi-yau space were selected. for a while, everything is going along fine, but then,
in the midst of your work, you come upon a mathematical calculation of insurmountable difficulty. no
one, not even the world's most expert mathematicians, can figure out how to proceed. you are stuck.
but  then  you  realize  that  this  calabi-yau  has  a  mirror  partner.  since  the  resulting  string  physics
associated with each member of a mirror pair is identical, you recognize that you are free to do your
calculations  making  use  of  either.  and  so,  you  rephrase  the  difficult  calculation  on  the  original
calabi-yau space in terms of a calculation on its mirror, assured that the result of the calculation—
the  physics—will  be  the  same.  at  first  sight  you  might  think  that  the  rephrased  version  of  the

ng, by 20 boxes deep, by 20 boxes high. you quickly calculate that they arrived in 8,000
boxes, and that all you need to do is figure out how many oranges are packed in each. this you easily
do  by  borrowing  your  friend's  box  and  filling  it  with  oranges,  allowing  you  to  finish  your  huge
counting task with almost no effort. in essence, by cleverly reorganizing the calculation, you were
able to make it substantially easier to accomplish.

the situation with numerous calculations in string theory is similar. from the perspective of one
calabi-yau space, a calculation might involve an enormous number of difficult mathematical steps.
by  translating  the  calculation  to  its  mirror,  though,  the  calculation  is  reorganized  in  a  far  more
efficient manner, allowing it to be completed with relative ease. this point was made by plesser and
me, and was impressively put into practice in subsequent work by candelas with his collaborators

from  the  university  of  texas,  and  paul  green,  from  the
university  of  maryland.  they  showed  that  calculations  of  almost  unimaginable  difficulty  could  be
accomplished by using the mirror perspective, with a few pages of algebra and a desktop computer.

this  was  an  especially  exciting  development  for  mathematicians,  because  some  of  these
calculations were precisely the ones they had been stuck on for many years. string theory—or so the
physicists claimed—had beaten them to the solution.

now you should bear in mind that there is a good deal of healthy and generally good-natured
competition  between  mathematicians  and  physicists.  and  as  it  turns  out,  two  norwegian
mathematicians—geir  ellingsrud  and  stein  arild  strømme—happened  to  be  working  on  one  of
numerous calculations that candelas and his collaborators had successfully conquered with mirror

inside a particular calabi-yau space, somewhat like our analogy of counting oranges in a large bin.
at a meeting of physicists and mathematicians in berkeley in 1991, candelas announced the result
reached by his group using string theory and mirror symmetry: 317,206,375. ellingsrud and strømme
announced  the  result  of  their  very  difficult  mathematical  calculation:  2,682,549,425.  for  days,
mathematicians and physicists debated: who was right? the question turned into a real litmus test of
the quantitative reliability of string theory. a number of people even commented—somewhat in jest—
that  this  test  was  the  next  best  thing  to  being  able  to  compare  string  theory  with  experiment.

ndelas's results went far beyond the single numerical result that ellingsrud and strømme
claimed  to  have  calculated.  he  and  his  collaborators  claimed  to  have  also  answered  many  other
questions that were tremendously more difficult—so difficult in fact, that no mathematician had ever
even attempted to address them. but could the string theory results be trusted? the meeting ended
with a great deal of fruitful exchange between mathematicians and physicists, but no resolution of the
discrepancy.

about  a  month  later,  an  e-mail  message  was  widely  circulated  among  participants  in  the
berkeley meeting with the subject heading physics wins! ellingsrud and strømme had found an error
in their computer code that, when corrected, confirmed candelas's result. since then, there have been

titative reliability of the mirror symmetry of string theory: it has
passed all with flying colors. even more recently, almost a decade after physicists discovered mirror

foundations.  by  utilizing  substantial  contributions  of  the  mathematicians  maxim  kontsevich,  yuri

beyond the particulars of this success, what these developments really highlight is the role that
physics  has  begun  to  play  in  modern  mathematics.  for  quite  some  time,  physicists  have  "mined"
mathematical archives in search of tools for constructing and analyzing models of the physical world.
now, through the discovery of string theory, physics is beginning to repay the debt and to provide
mathematicians  with  powerful  new  approaches  to  their  unsolved  problems.  string  theory  not  only
provides  a  unifying  framework  for  physics,  but  it  may  well  forge  an  equally  deep  union  with
mathematics as well.

ed that there really is a puncture, but that we are
protected  from  this  cosmic  "singularity"  by  the  event  horizon  of  the  black  hole,  which  prevents
anything from escaping its gravitational grip. this reasoning led roger penrose of oxford university
to speculate on a "cosmic censorship hypothesis" that allows these kinds of spatial irregularities to
occur only if they are deeply hidden from our view behind the shroud of an event horizon. on the
other hand, prior to the discovery of string theory, some physicists surmised that a proper merger of
quantum mechanics and general relativity would show that the apparent puncture of space is actually
smoothed out—"sewn up," so to speak—by quantum considerations.

with  the  discovery  of  string  theory  and  the  harmonious  merger  of  quantum  mechanics  and
gravity,  we  are  finally  poised  to  study  these  issues. as  yet,  string  theorists  have  not  been  able  to

space can tear.

a tantalizing possibility

in  1987,  shing-tung  yau  and  his  student  gang  tian,  now  at  the  massachusetts  institute  of
technology,  made  an  interesting  mathematical  observation.  they  found,  using  a  well-known
mathematical  procedure,  that  certain  calabi-yau  shapes  could  be

 might actually occur in nature? might it be that, contrary to einstein's expectations, the fabric
of space can tear apart and subsequently be repaired in the manner described?

the mirror perspective

for a couple of years after their 1987 observation, yau would, every so often, encourage me to think
about the possible physical incarnation of these flop transitions. i didn't. to me it seemed that flop
transitions were merely a piece of abstract mathematics without any bearing on the physics of string
theory. in fact, based on the discussion in chapter 10 in which we found that circular dimensions have
a minimum radius, one might be tempted to say that string theory does not allow the sphere in figure

(as well as a previous paper of theirs with graham ross), plesser and i realized that we could repair
the  pinch  mathematically  in  two  different  ways.  one  way  led  to  the  calabi-yau  shape  in  figure
11.3(a)  while  the  other  led  to  that  in  figure  11.4(d).  this  suggested  to  us  that  the  evolution  from
figure 11.3(a) through figure 11.4(d) was something that could actually occur in nature.

by late 1991, then, at least a few string theorists had a strong feeling that the fabric of space can

tear. but no one had the technical facility to definitively establish or refute this striking possibility.

inching forward

off and on during 1992, plesser and i tried to show that the fabric of space can undergo space-tearing
flop transitions. our calculations yielded bits and pieces of supporting circumstantial evidence, but
we  could  not  find  definitive  proof.  sometime  during  the  spring,  plesser  visited  the  institute

for
advanced study in princeton to give a talk, and privately told witten about our recent attempts to
realize  the  mathematics  of  space-tearing  flop  transitions  within  the  physics  of  string  theory. after
summarizing our ideas, plesser waited for witten's response. witten turned from the blackboard and
stared out of his office window. after a minute of silence, maybe two, he turned back to plesser and
told him that if our ideas worked out, "it would be spectacular." this rekindled our efforts. but after a
while, with our progress stalled, each of us turned to working on other string theory projects.

even  so,  i  found  myself  mulling  over  the  possibility  of  space-tearing

months  went  by,  i  felt  increasingly  sure  that  they  had  to  be  part  and  parcel  of  string  theory.  the
preliminary  calculations  plesser  and  i  had  done,  together  with  insightful  discussions  with  david
morrison, a mathematician from duke university, made it seem that this was the only conclusion that
mirror symmetry naturally supported. in fact, during a visit to duke, morrison and i, together with
some helpful observations from sheldon katz of oklahoma state university, who was also visiting
duke at the time, outlined a strategy for proving that flop transitions can occu

when we sat down to do the required calculations, we found that they were extraordinarily intensive.

batyrev had become very interested in mirror symmetry, especially in the wake of the success of

of  chapter  10.  with  a  mathematician's  perspective,  though,  batyrev  was  unsettled  by  the  methods
plesser and i had invoked to find mirror pairs of calabi-yau spaces. although our approach used
tools  familiar  to  string  theorists,  batyrev  later  told  me  that  our  paper  seemed  to  him  to  be  "black
magic." this reflects the large cultural divide between the disciplines of physics and mathematics,
and as string theory blurs their borders, the vast differences in language, methods, and styles of each
field become increasingly apparent. physicists are more like avant-garde composers, willing to bend
traditional rules and brush the edge of acceptability in the search for solutions. mathematicians are

main commercial street in the town of princeton) trying to agree on a place to have dinner. this was
no small task since paul is as devout a meat eater as i am a vegetarian. in the midst of catching up on
each other's lives as we were walking along, he asked me if i had any ideas about new things to work

on. i told him i did, and recounted my take on the importance of establishing that the universe, if truly
described by string theory, can undergo space-tearing flop transitions. i also outlined the strategy i
had been pursuing, as well as my newfound hope that batyrev's work might allow us to fill in the
missing pieces. i thought that i was preaching to the converted, and that paul would be excited by this
prospect.  he  wasn't.  in  retrospect,  his  reticence  was  due  largely  to  our  good-natured  and  long-

 occurs. instead, we chose to rephrase the issue using the mirror description,
hoping  that  the  equations  involved  might  be  more  manageable.  this  is  schematically  illustrated  in
figure 11.5, in which the top row is the original evolution from figure 11.3(a) to figure 11.4(d), and
the bottom row is the same evolution from the perspective of the mirror calabi-yau shapes. as a
number  of  us  had  already  realized,  it  turns  out  that  in  the  mirror  rephrasing  it  appears  that  string
physics  is  perfectly  well  behaved  and  encounters  no  catastrophes. as  you  can  see,  there  does  not
seem to be any pinching or tearing in the bottom row in figure 11.5. however, the real question this
observation  raised  for  us  was  this:  were  we  pushing  mirror  symmetry  beyond  the  bounds  of  its
applicability? although the upper and lower calabi-yau shapes drawn on the far left-hand side of
figure 11.5 yield identical physics, is it true that at every step in the evolutio

shape progression leading to the tear in the upper calabi-yau shape in figure 11.5, we realized that
no one knew whether the upper and lower calabi-yau shapes in figure 11.5 continue to be mirrors
after  the  tear  has  occurred.  this  is  a  crucial  question,  because  if  they  are,  then  the  absence  of  a
catastrophe  in  the  mirror  perspective  would  mean  an  absence  in  the  original,  and  we  would  have
demonstrated that space can tear in string theory. we realized that this question could be reduced to a
calculation: extract the physical properties of the universe for the upper calabi-yau shape after the
tear (using, say, the upper-right calabi-yau shape in figure 11.5) and for its supposed mirror (the
lower-right calabi-yau shape in figure 11.5), and see if they are identical.

e nights at einstein's final stomping ground

edward  witten's  razor-sharp  intellect  is  clothed  in  a  soft-spoken  demeanor  that  often  has  a  wry,
almost ironic, edge. he is widely regarded as einstein's successor in the role of the world's greatest
living physicist. some would go even further and describe him as the greatest physicist of all time. he
has an insatiable appetite for cutting-edge physics problems and he wields tremendous influence in
setting the direction of research in string theory.

the  breadth  and  depth  of  witten's  productivity  is  legendary.  his  wife,  chiara  nappi,  who  is
also  a  physicist  at  the  institute,  paints  a  picture  of  witten  sitting  at  their  kitchen  table,  mentally
probing  the  edge  of  string  theory  knowledge,  and  only  now  and  then  returning  to  pick  up  pen  and
paper to verify an elusive detail or two.3 another story is told by a postdoctoral fellow who, one

struggling with complex string theory calculations at his desk while hearing the incessant rhythmic
patter of witten's keyboard, as paper after groundbreaking paper poured forth directly from mind to

a week or so after i arrived, witten and i were chatting in the institute's courtyard, and he asked
about my research plans. i told him about the space-tearing flops and the strategy we were planning to
pursue.  he  lit  up  upon  hearing  the  ideas,  but  cautioned  that  he  thought  the  calculations  would

hour or two on the relevant mathematics. school would typically let out at about 11 p.m.

we stuck to the program, day in and day out. progress was slow, but we could sense that things
were starting to fall into place. meanwhile, witten was making significant headway on reformulating
the weak link he had earlier identified. his work was establishing a new and more powerful method
of  translation  between  the  physics  of  string  theory  and  the  mathematics  of  the  calabi-yau  spaces.
aspinwall,  morrison,  and  i  had  almost  daily  impromptu  meetings  with  witten  at  which  he  would
show us new insights following from his approach. as the weeks went by, it gradually became clear
that unexpectedly, his work, from a vantage point completely different from our own, was converging
on the issue of flop transitions. aspinwall, morrison, and i realized that if we didn't complete our
calculation soon, witten would b

we  all  huddled  around  morrison's  computer  in  the  office  he  and  i  shared.  aspinwall  told
morrison how to bring his program up on the screen and showed us the precise form for the required
input. morrison appropriately formatted the results we had generated the previous night, and we were
set to go.

the  particular  calculation  we  were  performing  amounts,  roughly  speaking,  to  determining  the
mass of a certain particle species—a specific vibrational pattern of a string—when moving through a
universe whose calabi-yau component we had spent all fall identifying. we hoped, in line with the
strategy discussed earlier, that this mass would agree identically with a similar calculation done on
the calabi-yau shape emerging from the space-tearing flop transition. the latter was the relatively
easy  calculation,  and  we  had  completed  it  weeks  before;  the  answer  turned  out  to  be  3,  in  the
particular  units  we  were  using.  since  we  were  now  doing

 we needed to do another
example. having already written all of the necessary computer code, this was not hard to do. we
calculated another particle mass on the upper calabi-yau shape, being careful this time to make no
errors. we found the answer: 12. once again, we huddled around the computer and set it on its way.
seconds  later  it  returned  11.999999. agreement.  we  had  shown  that  the  supposed  mirror is  the
mirror, and hence space-tearing flop transitions are part of the physics of string theory.

at this i jumped out of my chair and ran an unrestrained victory lap around the office. morrison
beamed from behind the computer. aspinwall's reaction, though, was rather different. "that's great,
but i knew it would work," he calmly said. "and where's my beer?"

witten's approach

that monday, we triumphantly went to witten and told him of our success. he was very pleased with
our result. and, as it turned out, he too had just found a way of establishing that flop transitions occur

in  string  theory.  his  argument  was  quite  different  from  ours,  and  it  significantly  illuminates  the
microscopic understanding of why the spatial tears do not have any catastrophic consequences.

his approach highlights the difference between a point-particle theory and string theory when
such tears occur. the key distinction is that there are two types of string motion near the tear, but only
one kind of point-particle motion. namely, a string can travel adjacent to the tear, like a point particle
does, but it can also encircle the tear as it moves forward, as illustrated in figure 11.6. in essence,
witten's analysis reveals that strings which encircle the tear, something that cannot happen in a point-
particle theory, shield the surrounding universe from the catastrophic effects that would otherwise be
encountered.  it's  as  if  the  world-sheet  of  the  string—recall  from  chapter  6  that  this  is  a  two-

e that a string sweeps out as it moves through space—provides a protective barrier
that precisely cancels out the calamitous aspects of the geometrical degeneration of the spatial fabric.
you might well ask, what if such a tear should occur, and it just so happens that there are no
strings in the vicinity to shield it? moreover, you might also be concerned that at the instant in time
that a tear occurs, a string—an infinitely thin loop—would provide as effective a barrier as shielding
yourself from a cluster bomb by hiding behind a hula hoop. the resolution to both of these issues
relies on a central feature of quantum mechanics that we discussed in chapter 4. there we saw that in
feynman's formulation of quantum mechanics, an object, be it a particle or a string, travels from one
location to another by "sniffing out" all possible trajectories. the resulting motion that is observed is
a combination

 of all possibilities, with the relative contributions of each possible trajectory precisely
determined by the mathematics of quantum mechanics. should a tear in the fabric of space occur, then
among the possible trajectories of travelling strings are those that encircle the tear—trajectories such
as those in figure 11.6. even if no strings seem to be near the tear when it occurs, quantum mechanics
takes account of physical effects from all possible string trajectories and among these are numerous
(infinite, in fact) protective paths that encircle the tear. it is these contributions that witten showed
precisely to cancel out the cosmic calamity that the tear would otherwise create.

figure  11.6  the  world-sheet  swept  out  by  a  string  provides  a  shield  that  cancels  the  potentially
cataclysmic effects associated with a tear in the fabric of space.

in january 1993, witten and the three of us released our papers simultaneously to the el

papers described, from our widely different perspectives, the first examples of topology-changing

question about whether the fabric of space can tear had been settled quantitatively by string theory.

consequences

we have made much of the realization that spatial tears can occur without physical calamity. but what
does happen when the spatial fabric rips? what are the observable consequences? we have seen that
many  properties  of  the  world  around  us  depend  upon  the  detailed  structure  of  the  curled-up
dimensions. and so, you would think that the fairly drastic transformation from one calabi-yau to
another as shown in figure 11.5, would have a significant physical impac

nsional  drawings  that  we  use  to  visualize  the  spaces  make  the  transformation  appear  to  be
somewhat more complicated than it actually is. if we could visualize six-dimensional geometry, we
would  see  that,  yes,  the  fabric  is  tearing,  but  it  does  so  in  a  fairly  mild  way.  it's  more  like  the
handiwork of a moth on wool than that of a deep knee bend on shrunken trousers.

our work and that of witten show that physical characteristics such as the number of families of
string vibrations and the types of particles within each family are unaffected by these processes. as
the  calabi-yau  space  evolves  through  a  tear,  what  can  be  affected  are  the  precise  values  of  the
masses  of  the  individual  particles—the  energies  of  the  possible  patterns  of  string  vibrations.  our
papers showed that these masses will vary continuously in response to the changing geometrical form
of the calabi-yau component of space, some going up while others go down. of p
 
 ___________________________
 
although our and witten's analyses did rely on special mathematical features of calabi-yau
shapes, the result—that the fabric of space can tear—is certainly of wider applicability.

second,  could  such  a  topology-changing  tear  happen  today  or  tomorrow?  could  it  have
happened  in  the  past? yes.  experimental  measurements  of  elementary  particle  masses  show  their
values to be quite stable over time. but if we head back to the earliest epochs following the big bang,
even non-string-based theories invoke important periods during which elementary particle masses do
change over time. these periods, from a string-theoretic perspective, could certainly have involved
the topology-changing tears discussed in this chapter. closer to the present, the observed stability of
elementary particle masses implies that if the universe is currently undergoing a topology-changing
spatial tear, it must be doing it exceedingly slowly—so slowly that its effect on elementary particle
masses i

ensitivity. remarkably, so long as this condition is
met,  the  universe  could  currently  be  in  the  midst  of  a  spatial  rupture.  if  it  were  occurring  slowly
enough, we would not even know it was happening. this is one of those rare instances in physics in
which the lack of a striking observable phenomenon is cause for great excitement. the absence of an
observable calamitous consequence from such an exotic geometrical evolution is testament to how far
beyond einstein's expectations string theory has gone.

beyond strings: in search of m-theory

in  his  long  search  for  a  unified  theory,  einstein  reflected  on  whether  "god  could  have  made  the
universe in a different way; that is, whether the necessity of logical simplicity leaves any freedom at
all."1 with this remark, einstein articulated the nascent form of a view that is currently shared by
many physicists: if there is a final theory of nature, one of the most convincing arguments in support of

e. inevitability answers these questions by erasing the options. inevitability means
that, in actuality, there are no choices. inevitability declares that the universe could not have been
different. as we will discuss in chapter 14, nothing ensures that the universe is so tightly constructed.
nevertheless,  the  pursuit  of  such  rigidity  in  the  laws  of  nature  lies  at  the  heart  of  the  unification
program in modern physics.

by the late 1980s, it appeared to physicists that although string theory came close to providing a
unique picture of the universe, it did not quite make the grade. there were two reasons for this. first,
as briefly noted in chapter 7, physicists found that there were actually five different versions of string
theory.  you  may  recall  that  they  are  called  the  type  i,  type  iia,  type  iib,  heterotic  o(32)
(heterotic-o, for short), and heterotic e8 × e8 (heterotic-e, for short) theories. they all share many
basic features—their vibrational pattern

s,  their  curled-up  dimensions  must  be  in  one  of  the  calabi-yau
shapes,  etc.—and  for  this  reason  we  have  not  emphasized  their  differences  in  previous  chapters.
nevertheless,  analyses  in  the  1980s  showed  that  they  do  differ.  you  can  read  more  about  their
properties  in  the  endnotes,  but  it's  enough  to  know  that  they  differ  in  how  they  incorporate
supersymmetry as well as in significant details of the vibrational patterns they support.2 (type i string
theory, for example, has open strings with two loose ends in addition to the closed loops we have
focused on.) this has been an embarrassment for string theorists because although it's impressive to
have a serious proposal for the final unified theory, having five proposals takes significant wind from
the sails of each.

the  second  deviation  from  inevitability  is  more  subtle.  to  fully  appreciate  it,  you  must
recognize that all physical theories consist of two parts. the first part

ly many more). (for a simple example,
the equation "2 times a particular number equals 10" has one solution: 5. but the equation "0 times a
particular number equals 0" has infinitely many solutions, since 0 times any number is 0.) and so,
even  if  research  leads  to  a  unique  theory  with  unique  equations,  it  might  be  that  inevitability  is
compromised  because  the  equations  have  many  different  possible  solutions.  by  the  late  1980s,  it
appeared that this was the case with string theory. when physicists studied the equations of any one of
the  five  string  theories,  they  found  that  they do  have  many  solutions—for  example,  many  different
possible ways to curl up the extra dimensions—with each solution corresponding to a universe with
different properties. most of these universes, although emerging as valid solutions to the equations of
string theory, appear to be irrelevant to the world as we know it.

these deviations from inevitability might seem to be u
 
 ___________________________
 
nfortunate fundamental characteristics of
string theory. but research since the mid-1990s has given us dramatic new hope that these features
may be merely reflections of the way string theorists have been analyzing the theory. briefly put, the
equations  of  string  theory  are  so  complicated  that  no  one  knows  their  exact  form.  physicists  have
managed to write down only approximate versions of the equations. it is these approximate equations
that  differ  significantly  from  one  string  theory  to  the  next. and  it  is  these  approximate  equations,
within the context of any one of the five string theories, that give rise to an abundance of solutions, a
cornucopia of unwanted universes.

since 1995 (the start of the second superstring revolution), there has been a growing body of
evidence that the exact equations, whose precise form is still beyond our reach, may resolve these
problems, thereby helping to give string theory the stamp of inevitability. in fact, it has alrea
 
 ___________________________
 
dy been
established to the satisfaction of most string theorists that, when the exact equations are understood,
they will show that all five string theories are actually intimately related. like the appendages on a
starfish, they are all part of one connected entity whose detailed properties are currently under intense
investigation. rather than having five distinct string theories, physicists are now convinced that there
is one theory that sews all five into a unique theoretical framework. and like the clarity that emerges
when hitherto hidden relationships are revealed, this union is providing a powerful new vantage point
for understanding the universe according to string theory.

to explain these insights we must engage some of the most difficult, cutting-edge developments
in string theory. we must understand the nature of the approximations used in studying s

tring theory
and their inherent limitations. we must gain some familiarity with the clever techniques—collectively
called dualities—that physicists have invoked to circumvent some of these approximations. and then
we must follow the subtle reasoning that makes use of these techniques to find the remarkable insights
alluded to above. but don't worry. the really hard work has already been done by string theorists and
we will content ourselves here with explaining their results.

nevertheless, as there are many seemingly separate pieces that we must develop and assemble,
in this chapter it is especially easy to lose the forest for the trees. and so, if at any time in this chapter
the discussion gets a little too involved and you feel compelled to rush on to black holes (chapter 13)
or cosmology (chapter 14), take a quick glance back at the following section, which summarizes the
key insights of

 the second superstring revolution.

a summary of the second superstring revolution

the primary insight of the second superstring revolution is summarized by figures 12.1 and 12.2. in
figure 12.1 we see the situation prior to the recent ability to go (partially) beyond the approximation
methods physicists have traditionally used to analyze string theory. we see that the five string theories
were thought of as being completely separate. but, with the newfound insights emerging from recent
research,  as  indicated  in  figure  12.2,  we  see  that,  like  the  starfish's  five  arms,  all  of  the  string
theories are now viewed as a single, all-encompassing framework. (in fact, by the end of this chapter
we will see that even a sixth theory—a sixth arm—will be merged into this union.) this overarching
framework  has  provisionally  been  called  m-theory,  for  reasons
 
 ___________________________
 
  that  will  become  clear  as  we
proceed.  figure  12.2  represents  a  landmark  achievement  in  the  quest  for  the  ultimate  theory.
seemingly  disconnected  threads  of  research  in  string  theory  have  now  been  woven  together  into  a
single  tapestry—a  unique,  all-encompassing  theory  that  may  well  be  the  long-sought  theory  of
everything.

figure 12.1 for many years, physicists working on the five string theories thought they were working
on completely separate theories.

figure 12.2 results from the second superstring revolution have shown that all five string theories
are actually part of a single, unified framework, tentatively called m-theory.

although  much  work  remains  to  be  done,  there  are  two  essential  features  of  m-theory  that
physicists have already uncovered. first, m-theory has eleven dimensions (ten space and one time).
somewhat as kaluza found that one additional spa
 
 ___________________________
 
tial dimension allowed for an unexpected merger of
general  relativity  and  electromagnetism,  string  theorists  have  realized  that  one  additional  spatial
dimension in string theory—beyond the nine space and one time dimensions discussed in preceding
chapters—allows for a deeply satisfying synthesis of all five versions of the theory. moreover, this
extra  spatial  dimension  is  not  pulled  out  of  thin  air;  rather,  string  theorists  have  realized  that  the

reasoning of the 1970s and 1980s that led to one time and nine space dimensions was approximate,
and  that  exact  calculations,  which  can  now  be  completed,  show  that  one  spatial  dimension  had
hitherto been overlooked.

the second feature of m-theory that has been discovered is that it contains vibrating strings, but
it  also  includes  other  objects:  vibrating two-dimensional  membranes,  undulating three-dimensional
blobs (called "three-bra

ance on the approximations
used prior to the mid-1990s.

beyond these and a variety of other insights attained over the last few years, much of the true
nature of m-theory remains mysterious—one suggested meaning for the "m." physicists worldwide
are working with great vigor to acquire a full understanding of m-theory, and this may well constitute
the central problem of twenty-first-century physics.

an approximation method

the limitations of the methods physicists have been using to analyze string theory are bound up with
something  called perturbation  theory.  perturbation  theory  is  an  elaborate  name  for  making  an
approximation  to  try  to  give  a  rough  answer  to  a  question,  and  then  systematically  improving  this
approximation by paying closer attention to fine details initially ignored. it plays an important part in
many areas of scientific research, has been an essential element in understanding string theory, and, as
we now illustrate, is also something we encoun

ometimes  when  you  go  to  pay  a  final  bill  it  is
shockingly  different  from  the  initial  estimate. although  you  might  use  other,  more  emotive  terms,
technically this is called a failure of perturbation theory. this means that the initial approximation
was not a good guide to the final answer because the "refinements," rather than causing relatively
small deviations, resulted in large changes to the ballpark estimate.

as indicated briefly in earlier chapters, our discussion of string theory to this point has relied on
a  perturbative  approach  somewhat  analogous  to  that  used  by  the  mechanic.  the  "incomplete
understanding" of string theory that we have referred to from time to time has its roots, in one way or
another, in this approximation method. let's build up to an understanding of this important remark by
discussing perturbation theory in a context that is less abstract than string theory but closer to its string

which in turn has a large impact on the motion of the third star, which then has a substantial impact on
the other two, and so on. all strands in the gravitational web are equally important and must be dealt
with simultaneously. oftentimes, in such cases, our only recourse is to make use of the brute power of
computers to simulate the resulting motion.

figure 12.3 strings interact by joining and splitting.

this  example  highlights  the  importance,  when  using  a  perturbative  approach,  of  determining
whether the supposedly ballpark estimate really is in the ballpark, and if it is, which and how many of
the finer details must be included in order to achieve a desired level of accuracy. as we now discuss,
these  issues  are  particularly  crucial  for  applying  perturbative  tools  to  physical  processes  in  the
microworld.

tring theory

physical processes in string theory are built up from the basic interactions between vibrating strings.
as  we  discussed  toward  the  end  of  chapter  6,*  these  interactions  involve  the  splitting  apart  and
joining  together  of  string  loops,  such  as  in  figure  6.7,  which  we  reproduce  in  figure  12.3  for
convenience. string theorists have shown how a precise mathematical formula can be associated with
the  schematic  portrayal  of  figure  12.3—a  formula  that  expresses  the  influence  that  each  incoming

frenzy dictated by the uncertainty principle implies that string/antistring pairs (two strings executing
opposite  vibrational  patterns)  can  momentarily  erupt  into  existence,  borrowing  energy  from  the
universe,  so  long  as  they  annihilate  one  another  with  sufficient  haste,  thereby  repaying  the  energy
loan. such pairs of strings, born of the quantum frenzy but which live on borrowed energy and hence
must shortly recombine into a single loop, are known as virtual string pairs. and even though it is

properties of the interaction.

any number of times, producing a sequence of virtual string pairs. this gives
rise  to  diagrams  with  more  and  more  loops,  as  illustrated  in  figure  12.5.  each  of  these  diagrams
provides a handy and simple way of depicting the physical processes involved: the incoming strings
merge together, quantum jitters cause the resulting loop to split apart into a virtual string pair, these
travel  along  and  then  annihilate  one  another  by  merging  together  into  a  single  loop,  which  travels
along and produces another virtual string pair, and on and on. as with the other diagrams, there is a
corresponding  mathematical  formula  for  each  of  these  processes  that  summarizes  the  effect  on  the
motion of the original pair of strings.4

more precise understanding of the motion of the earth through a refinement of the sun's influence by
including the smaller effects of the moon and other planets, string theorists have shown that we can
understand the interaction between two strings by adding together the mathematical expressions for
diagrams with no loops (no virtual string pairs), with one loop (one pair of virtual strings), with two
loops (two pairs of virtual strings), and so forth, as illustrated in figure 12.6.

figure 12.5 the quantum frenzy can cause numerous sequences of string/antistring pairs to erupt and
annihilate.

an exact calculation requires that we add together the mathematical expressions associated with
each of these diagrams, with an increasingly large number of loops. but, since there are an infinite
number  of  such  diagrams  and  the  mathematical  calculations  associated  with  each  get
 
 ___________________________
 
  increasingly
difficult as the number of loops grows, this is an impossible task. instead, string theorists have cast
these calculations into a perturbative framework based on the expectation that a reasonable ballpark
estimate is given by the zero-loop processes, with the loop diagrams resulting in refinements that get
smaller as the number of loops increases.

figure 12.6 the net influence each incoming string has on the other comes from adding together the
influences involving diagrams with ever more loops.

in fact, almost everything we know about string theory—including much of the material covered
in  previous  chapters—has  been  discovered  by  physicists  performing  detailed  and  elaborate
calculations using this perturbative approach. but to trust the accuracy of the results found, one must
determine whether the supposedly ballpark approximations that ignore all but the first few diagra

in figure 12.6 are really in the ballpark. this leads us to  ask  the  crucial  question: are  we  in  the
ballpark?

is the ballpark in the ballpark?

it  depends.  although  the  mathematical  formula  associated  with  each  diagram  becomes  very
complicated as the number of loops grows, string theorists have recognized one basic and essential
feature.  somewhat  as  the  strength  of  a  rope  determines  the  likelihood  that  vigorous  pulling  and
shaking will cause it to tear into two pieces, there is a number that determines the likelihood that
quantum fluctuations will cause a single string to split into two strings, momentarily yielding a virtual
pair. this number is known as the string coupling constant (more precisely, each of the five string
theories  has  its  own  string 
 
 ___________________________
 
 coupling  constant,  as  we  will  discuss  shortly).  the  name  is  quite
descriptive:  the  size  of  the  string  coupling  constant  describes  how  strongly  the  quantum  jitters  of
three strings (the initial loop and the two virtual loops into which it splits) are related—how tightly,
so to speak, they are coupled to one another. the calculational formalism shows that the larger the
string coupling constant, the more likely it is that quantum jitters will cause an initial string to split
apart (and subsequently rejoin); the smaller the string coupling constant, the less likely it is for such
virtual strings to erupt momentarily into existence.

we  will  shortly  take  up  the  question  of  determining  the  value  of  the  string  coupling  constant
within any of the five string theories, but first, what do we really mean by "small" or "large" when
assessing  its  size?  well,  the  mathematics  underlying  string  theory  shows  that  the  dividing  line
between "sm
 
 ___________________________
 
all" and "large" is the number 1, in the following sense. if the string coupling constant
has a value less than 1, then—like multiple strikes of lightning—larger numbers of virtual string pairs
are increasingly unlikely to erupt momentarily into existence. if the coupling constant is 1 or greater,
however,  it  is  increasingly likely  that  ever-larger  numbers  of  such  virtual  pairs  will  momentarily
burst on the scene.5 the upshot is that if the string coupling constant is less than 1, the loop diagram
contributions become ever smaller as the number of loops grows. this is just what is needed for the
perturbative  framework,  since  it  indicates  that  we  will  get  reasonably  accurate  results  even  if  we
ignore all processes except for those with just a few loops. but if the string coupling constant is not
less than 1, the loop diagram contributions become more important as the number of loops increases.

as  in  the  case  of  a  tri

nary  star  system,  this  invalidates  a  perturbative  approach.  the  supposed
ballpark approximation—the process with no loops—is not in the ballpark. (this discussion applies
equally well to each of the five string theories—with the value of the string coupling constant in any
given theory determining the efficacy of the perturbative approximation scheme.)

this realization leads us to the next crucial question: what is the value of the string coupling
constant (or, more precisely, what are the values of the string coupling constants in each of the five
string  theories)? at  present,  no  one  has  been  able  to  answer  this  question.  it  is  one  of  the  most
important unresolved issues in string theory. we can be sure that conclusions based on a perturbative
framework are justified only if the string coupling constant is less than 1. moreover, the precise value
of the string coupling constant has a direct impact on the masses
 
 ___________________________
 
 and charges carried by the various
string vibrational patterns. thus, we see that much physics hinges on the value of the string coupling
constant. and so, let's take a closer look at why the important question of its value—in any of the five
string theories—remains unanswered.

the equations of string theory

the perturbative approach for determining how strings interact with one another can also be used to
determine  the  fundamental  equations  of  string  theory.  in  essence,  the  equations  of  string  theory
determine  how  strings  interact  and,  conversely,  the  way  strings  interact  directly  determines  the
equations of the theory.

as  a  prime  example,  in  each  of  the  five  string  theories  there  is  an  equation  that  is  meant  to
determine the value of the theory's coupling constant. currently, however, physicists have been able
to find only an approximation to this equation, in each of the five string theories, by math
 
 ___________________________
 
ematically
evaluating a small number of relevant string diagrams using a perturbative approach. here is what the
approximate equations say: in any of the five string theories, the string coupling constant takes on a
value such that if it is multiplied by zero the result is zero. this is a terribly disappointing equation;
since  any  number  times  zero  yields  zero,  the  equation  can  be  solved  with  any  value  of  the  string
coupling  constant.  thus,  in  any  of  the  five  string  theories,  the  approximate  equation  for  its  string
coupling constant gives us no information about its value.

while we are at it, in each of the five string theories there is another equation that is supposed to
determine  the  precise  form  of  both  the  extended  and  the  curled-up  spacetime  dimensions.  the
approximate  version  of  this  equation  that  we  currently  have  is  far  more  restrictive  than  the  one
dealing  with  the  string  coupling  constant,  but  it  still

  admits  many  solutions.  for  instance,  four
extended  spacetime  dimensions  together  with  any  curled-up,  six-dimensional  calabi-yau  space
provide a whole class of solutions, but even this does not exhaust the possibilities, which also allow
for a different split between the number of extended and curled-up dimensions.6

what can we make of these results? there are three possibilities. first, starting with the most
pessimistic possibility, although each string theory comes equipped with equations to determine the
value  of  its  coupling  constant  as  well  as  the  dimensionality  and  precise  geometrical  form  of
spacetime—something  no  other  theory  can  claim—even  the  as-yet-unknown  exact  form  of  these
equations may admit a vast spectrum of solutions, substantially weakening their predictive power. if
true, this would be a setback, since the promise of string theory is that it will be able to explain these
features of the cosmos, r

ather than require us to determine them from experimental observation and,
more or less arbitrarily, insert them into the theory. we will return to this possibility in chapter 15.

second, the unwanted flexibility in the approximate string equations may be an indication of a subtle
flaw in our reasoning. we are attempting to use a perturbative approach to determine the value of the
string  coupling  constant  itself.  but,  as  discussed,  perturbative  methods  are  sensible  only  if  the
coupling constant is less than 1, and hence our calculation may be making an unjustified assumption
about its own answer—namely, that the result will be smaller than 1. our failure could well indicate
that this assumption is wrong and that, perhaps, the coupling in any one of the five string theories is
greater than 1. third, the unwanted flexibility may merely be due to our use of approxim

than exact equations. for instance, even though the coupling constant in a given string theory might be
less  than  1,  the  equations  of  the  theory  may  still  depend  sensitively  on  the  contributions  from all
diagrams. that is, the accumulated small refinements from diagrams with ever more loops might be
essential  for  modifying  the  approximate  equations—which  admit  many  solutions—into  exact
equations that are far more restrictive.

by  the  early  1990s,  the  latter  two  possibilities  made  it  clear  to  most  string  theorists  that
complete reliance on
 
 ___________________________
 
 the perturbative framework was standing squarely in the way of progress. the
next breakthrough, most everyone in the field agreed, would require a nonperturbative approach—an
approach  that  was  not  shackled  to  approximate  calculational  techniques  and  could  therefore  reach
well beyond the limitations of the perturbative framework. as of 1994, finding such a means seemed
like a pipe dream. sometimes, though, pipe dreams spill over into reality.

duality

hundreds of string theorists from around the world gather together annually for a conference devoted
to  recapping  the  past  year's  results  and  assessing  the  relative  merit  of  various  possible  research
directions. depending on the state of progress in a given year, one can usually predict the level of
interest and excitement among the participants. in the mid-1980s, the heyday of the first superstring
revolution, the meetings were filled with unrestrained euphoria. physicists had widespread hope that

 
 ___________________________
 
they  would  shortly  understand  string  theory  completely,  and  that  they  would  reveal  it  to  be  the
ultimate theory of the universe. in retrospect this was naive. the intervening years have shown that
there  are  many  deep  and  subtle  aspects  of  string  theory  that  will  undoubtedly  take  prolonged  and
dedicated  effort  to  understand.  the  early,  unrealistic  expectations  resulted  in  a  backlash;  when
everything  did  not  immediately  fall  into  place,  many  researchers  were  crestfallen.  the  string
conferences  of  the  late  1980s  reflected  the  low-level  disillusionment—physicists  presented
interesting  results,  but  the  atmosphere  lacked  inspiration.  some  even  suggested  that  the  community
stop holding an

annual strings conference. but things picked up in the early 1990s. through various
breakthroughs, some of which we have discussed in previous chapters, string theory was rebuilding
its momentum and researchers were regaining their excitement and optimism. but very little presaged
what happened at the strings conference in march 1995 at the university of southern california.

when  his  appointed  hour  to  speak  had  arrived,  edward  witten  strode  to  the  podium  and
delivered a lecture that ignited the second superstring revolution. inspired by earlier works of duff,
hull, townsend, and building on insights of schwarz, the indian physicist ashoke sen, and others,
witten announced a strategy for transcending the perturbative understanding of string theory. a central
part of the plan involves

ivity, it would be equally challenging regardless of the
language  used  to  expressed  it.  a  switch  from  english  to  chinese,  or  vice  versa,  brings  no  new
physical insight.

nontrivial  examples  of  duality  are  those  in  which  distinct  descriptions  of  the  same  physical
situation do  yield  different  and  complementary  physical  insights  and  mathematical  methods  of
analysis. in fact, we have already encountered two examples of duality. in chapter 10, we discussed
how  string  theory  in  a  universe  that  has  a  circular  dimension  of  radius r  can  equally  well  be
described  as  a  universe  with  a  circular  dimension  of  radius  1/r.  these  are  distinct  geometrical
situations  that,  through  the  properties  of  string  theory,  are  actually  physically  identical.  mirror
symmetry  is  a  second  example.  here  two  different  calabi-yau  shapes  of  the  extra  six  spatial
dimensions—universes that at first sight would appear to be completely 
 
 ___________________________
 
distinct—yield exactly the
same physical properties. they give dual descriptions of a single universe. of crucial importance,
unlike the case of english versus chinese, there are important physical insights that follow from using
these  dual  descriptions,  such  as  a  minimum  size  for  circular  dimensions  and  topology-changing
processes in string theory.

in his lecture at strings '95, witten gave evidence for a new, profound kind of duality. as briefly
outlined at the beginning of this chapter, he suggested that the five string theories, although apparently
different  in  their  basic  construction,  are  all  just  different  ways  of  describing  the  same  underlying
physics. rather than having five different string theories, then, we would simply have five different
windows onto this single underlying theoretical framework.

before the developments of the mid-1990s
 
 ___________________________
 
, the possibility of such a grand version of duality was
one of those wishful ideas that physicists might harbor, but about which they would rarely if ever
speak, since it seems so outlandish. if two string theories differ with regard to significant details of
their construction, it's hard to imagine how they could merely be different descriptions of the same
underlying physics. nonetheless, through the subtle power of string theory, there is mounting evidence
that all five string theories are dual. and furthermore, as we will discuss, witten gave evidence that
even a sixth theory gets mixed into the stew.

these  developments  are  intimately  entwined  with  the  issues  regarding  the  applicability  of
perturbative methods we encountered at the end of the preceding section. the reason is that the five
string theories are manifestly different when each is weakly coupled—a term of the trade meaning that
the coupling constant of a theory is less than 1. because of the
 
 ___________________________
 
ir reliance on perturbative methods,
physicists have been unable for some time to address the question of what properties any one of the
string theories would have if its coupling constant should be larger than 1—the so-called strongly
coupled behavior. the claim of witten and others, as we now discuss, is that this crucial question can
now be answered. their results convincingly suggest that, together with a sixth theory we have yet to
describe, the strong coupling behavior of any of these theories has a dual description in terms of the
weak coupling behavior of another, and vice versa.

water and ice; to them, they are two completely different substances. but as they head out into the
scorching heat of the desert, they are shocked to find that the ice slowly begins to turn into water.
and, in the frigid cold of the desert night, they are equally shocked to find that the liquid water slowly
begins to turn into solid ice. they realize that these two substances—which they initially thought to be
completely unrelated—are intimately connected.

the  duality  among  the  five  string  theories  is  somewhat  similar:  roughly  speaking,  the  string
coupling constants play a role analogous to temperature in our desert analogy. like ice and water, any
two of the five string theories, at first sight, appear to be completely distinct. but as we vary their
respective coupling constants, the theories transmute among themselves. just as ice transmutes into
water as we raise its temperature, one string theory can transmute into another as we increase the
value of its coupling cons

tant. this takes us a long way toward showing that all of the string theories
are dual descriptions of one single underlying structure—the analog of h2o for water and ice.

the reasoning underlying these results relies almost entirely on the use of arguments rooted in

principles of symmetry. let's discuss this.

the power of symmetry

over the years, no one even attempted to study the properties of any of the five string theories for
large values of their string coupling constants because no one had any idea how to proceed without
the perturbative framework. however, during the late 1980s and early 1990s, physicists made slow
but  steady  progress  in  identifying  certain  special  properties—including  certain  masses  and  force
charges—that are part of the strong-coupling physics of a given string theory, and yet are still within
our  ability  to  calculate.  the  calculation  of  these  properties,  which  necessarily  transcends  the

tive framework, has played a central role in driving the progress of the second superstring
revolution and is firmly rooted in the power of symmetry.

symmetry  principles  provide  insightful  tools  for  understanding  a  great  many  things  about  the
physical  world.  we  have  discussed,  for  instance,  that  the  well-supported  belief  that  the  laws  of
physics do not treat any place in the universe or moment in time as special allows us to argue that the
laws governing the here and now are the same ones at work everywhere and everywhen. this is a
grandiose  example,  but

but it is often far easier to invoke the left-right symmetry of faces.7

supersymmetry  is  a  more  abstract  symmetry  principle  that  relates  physical  properties  of
elementary  constituents  that  carry  different  amounts  of  spin.  at  best  there  are  only  hints  from
experimental  results  that  the  microworld  incorporates  this  symmetry,  but,  for  reasons  discussed
earlier, there is a strong belief that it does. it is certainly an integral part of string theory. in the 1990s,
led by the pioneering work of nathan seiberg of the institute for advanced study, physicists have
realized that supersymmetry provides a sharp and incisive tool that can answer some very difficult
and important questions by indirect means.

even without understanding intricate details of a theory, the fact that it has supersymmetry built
in allows us to place significant constraints on the properties it can have. using a linguistic analogy,
imagine  that  we  are  told  th

ghtest it could possibly be and still have the specified charge, physicists showed
that its identity is fully established. constituents of minimum mass for a chosen value of charge are
known as bps states, in honor of their three discoverers.8

the important thing about bps states is that their properties are uniquely, easily, and exactly
determined  without  resort  to  a  perturbative  calculation.  this  is  true  regardless  of  the  value  of  the

coupling constants. that is, even if the string coupling constant is large, implying that the perturbative
approach is invalid, we are still able to deduce the exact properties of the bps configurations. the
properties  are  often  called nonperturbative  masses  and  charges  since  their  values  transcend  the
perturbative  approximation  scheme.  for  this  reason,  you  can  also  think  of  bps  as  standing  for
"beyond perturbative states."

its  coupling  constant  is  large,  but  they  nonetheless  give  us  a  tangible  grip  on  some  of  its  strong
coupling characteristics. as the coupling constant in a chosen string theory is increased beyond the
realm accessible to perturbation theory, we anchor our limited understanding in the bps states. like a
few choice words in a foreign tongue, we will find that they will take us quite far.

duality in string theory

following witten, let's start with one of the five string theories, say the type i string, and imagine that
all of its nine space dimensions are flat and unfurled. this, of course, is not at all realistic, but it
makes the discussion simpler; we will return to curled-up dimensions shortly. we begin by assuming
that the string coupling constant is much less than 1. in this case, perturbative tools are valid, and
hence many of the detailed properties of the theory can and have been worked out with accuracy. if
we increase the value of the coupling const
 
 ___________________________
 
ant but still keep it a good deal less than 1, perturbative
methods can still be used. the detailed properties of the theory will change somewhat—for instance,
the numerical values associated with the scattering of one string off another will be a bit different
because  the  multiple  loop  processes  of  figure  12.6  make  greater  contributions  when  the  coupling
constant increases. but beyond these changes in detailed numerical properties, the overall physical
content  of  the  theory  remains  the  same,  so  long  as  the  coupling  constant  stays  in  the  perturbative
realm.

as  we  increase  the  type  i  string  coupling  constant  beyond  the  value  1,  perturbative  methods
become invalid and so we 
 
 ___________________________
 
focus only on the limited set of nonperturbative masses and charges—the
bps  states—that  are  still  within  our  ability  to  understand.  here  is  what  witten  argued,  and  later
confirmed through joint work with joe polchinski of the university of california at santa barbara:
these strong coupling characteristics of type i string theory exactly agree with known properties
of heterotic-o string theory, when the latter has a small value for its string coupling constant.
that is, when the coupling constant of the type i string is large, the particular masses and charges that
we  know  how  to  extract  are  precisely  equal  to  those  of  the  heterotic-o  string  when  its  coupling
constant is small. this gives us a strong indication that these two string theories, which at first sight,
like water and ice, seem totally different, are actually dual. it persuasively suggests that the physics of
the type i theory for large values of its coupl
 
 ___________________________
 
ing constant is identical to the physics of the heterotic-
o  theory  for  small  values  of  its  coupling  constant.  related  arguments  gave  equally  persuasive
evidence that the reverse is also true: the physics of the type i theory for small values of its coupling
constant  is  identical  to  that  of  the  heterotic-o  theory  for  large  values  of  its  coupling  constant.9
although  the  two  string  theories  appear  to  be  unrelated  when  analyzed  using  the  perturbative
approximation  scheme,  we  now  see  that  each  transforms  into  the  other—somewhat  like  the
transmutation between water and ice—as their coupling constants are varied in value.

this central new kind of result, in which the strong coupling physics of one theory is described
by the weak coupling physics of another theory, is known as strong-weak duality. as with the other

dualities  discussed  previously,

ve tools. if the coupling constant of the theory is large, however, and thus the
perturbative methods break down, we now know that we can use the dual description—a description
in  which  the  relevant  coupling  constant  is  small—and  return  to  the  use  of  perturbative  tools.  the
translation has resulted in our having quantitative methods to analyze a theory we initially thought to
be beyond our theoretical abilities.

actually proving that the strong coupling physics of the type i string theory is identical to the
weak coupling physics of the heterotic-o theory, and vice versa, is an extremely difficult task that
has  not  yet  been  achieved.  the  reason  is  simple.  one  member  of  the  pair  of  the  supposedly  dual
theories is not amenable to perturbative analysis, as its coupling constant is too big. this prevents
direct calculations of many of its physical properties. in fact, it is precisely this point that makes the
proposed duality so potent, for, if true, it provi

but even if we cannot prove that the two theories are dual, the perfect alignment between those
properties  we can  extract  with  confidence  provides  extremely  compelling  evidence  that  the
conjectured strong-weak coupling relationship between the type i and heterotic-o string theories is
correct. in fact, increasingly clever calculations that have been performed to test the proposed duality
have all resulted in positive results. most string theorists are convinced that the duality is true.

following  the  same  approach,  one  can  study  the  strong  coupling  properties  of  another  of  the
remaining string theories, say, the type iib string. as originally conjectured by hull and townsend
and supported by the research of a number of physicists, something equally

occur. as the coupling constant of the type iib string gets larger and larger, the physical properties
that we are still able to understand appear to match up exactly with that of the weakly coupled type
iib  string  itself.  in  other  words,  the  type  iib  string  is self-dual.10  specifically,  detailed  analysis
persuasively suggests that if the type iib coupling constant were larger than 1, and if we were to
change  its  value  to  its  reciprocal  (whose  value,  therefore,  is  less  than  1),  the  resulting  theory  is
absolutely  identical  to  the  one  we  started  with.  similar  to  what  we  found  in  trying  to  squeeze  a
circular dimension to a sub-planck-scale length, if we try to increase the type iib coupling to a value
larger than 1

, the self-duality shows that the resulting theory is precisely equivalent to the type iib
string with a coupling smaller than 1.

a summary, so far

let's  see  where  we  are.  by  the  mid-1980s,  physicists  had  constructed  five  different  superstring
theories. in the approximation scheme of perturbation theory, they all appear to be distinct. but this
approximation method is valid only if the string coupling constant in a given string theory is less than
1. the expectation has been that physicists should be able to calculate the precise value of the string
coupling  constant  in  any  given  string  theory,  but  the  form  of  the  approximate  equations  currently
available  makes  this  impossible.  for  this  reason,  physicists  aim  to  study  each  of  the  five  string
theories  for  a  range  of  possible  values  of  their  respective  coupling  constants,  both  less  than  and
greater  than  1—i.e.,  both  weak

  and  strong  coupling.  but  traditional  perturbative  methods  give  no

insight into the strong coupling characteristics of any of the string theories.

recently,  by  making  use  of  the  power  of  supersymmetry,  physicists  have  learned  how  to
calculate some of the strong coupling properties of a given string theory. and to the surprise of most
everyone in the field, the strong coupling properties of the heterotic-o string appear to be identical to
the  weak  coupling  properties  of  the  type  i  string,  and  vice  versa.  moreover,  the  strong  coupling
physics of the type iib string is identical to its own properties when its coupling is weak. these
unexpected links encourage us to follow witten and press on to the other two string theories, type iia

supergravity

in  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  before  the  surge  of  interest  in  string  theory,  many  theoretical
physicists  sought  a  unified  theory  of  quantum  mechanics,  gravity,  and  the  other  forces  in  the
framework  of  point-particle  quantum  field  theory.  the  hope  was  that  the  inconsistencies  between
point-particle  theories  involving  gravity  and  quantum  mechanics  would  be  overcome  by  studying
theories with a great deal of symmetry. in 1976 stanley deser and bruno zumino working at cern,
and independantly, daniel freedman, sergio ferrara, an

 give  cancelling  quantum
fluctuations helps to calm the violent microscopic frenzy. the authors coined the term supergravity to
describe  supersymmetric  quantum  field  theories  that  try  to  incorporate  general  relativity.  such
attempts  to  merge  general  relativity  with  quantum  mechanics  ultimately  met  with  failure.
nevertheless,  as  mentioned  in  chapter  8,  there  was  a  prescient  lesson  to  be  learned  from  these
investigations, one that presaged the development of string theory.

the lesson, which perhaps became most clear through the work of eugene cremmer, bernard
julia,  and  scherk,  all  of  the  ecole  normale  superieure  in  1978,  was  that  the  attempts  that  came
closest  to  success  were  supergravity  theories  formulated  not  in  four  dimensions,  but  in  more.
specifically, the most promising were the versions calling for ten or eleven dimensions, with eleven
dimensions, it turns out, being the maximal possible.11 contact with four observed

 dimensions was
accomplished in the framework, once again, of kaluza and klein: the extra dimensions were curled
up. in the ten-dimensional theories, as in string theory, six dimensions were curled up, while seven
were curled up for the eleven-dimensional theory.

when  string  theory  took  physicists  by  storm  in  1984,  the  perspective  on  point-particle
supergravity theories changed dramatically. as emphasized repeatedly, if we examine a string with
the precision available currently and for the foreseeable future, it looks like a point particle. we can
make  this  informal  remark  precise:  when  studying  low-energy  processes  in  string  theory—those
processes that do not have enough energy to probe the ultramicroscopic, extended nature of the string
—we can approximate a string by a structureless point particle, using the framework of point-particle
quantum field theory. we cannot use this approximation when dealing with shor

t-distance or high-
energy processes because we know that the extended nature of the string is crucial to its ability to
resolve the conflicts between general relativity and quantum mechanics that a point-particle theory
cannot. but at low enough energies—large enough distances—these problems are not encountered,
and such an approximation is often made for the sake of calculational convenience.

the  quantum  field  theory  that  most  closely  approximates  string  theory  in  this  manner  is  none
other  than  ten-dimensional  supergravity.  the  special  properties  of  ten-dimensional  supergravity
discovered  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  are  now  understood  to  be  low-energy  relics  of  the  underlying
power of string theory. researchers studying ten-dimensional supergravity had uncovered the tip of a
very  deep  iceberg—the  rich  structure  of  superstring  theory.  in  fact,  it  turns  out  that  there  are  four
different  ten-dimensional 
 
 ___________________________
 
 supergravity  theories  that  differ  in  details  regarding  the  precise  way  in
which  supersymmetry  is  incorporated.  three  of  these  turn  out  to  be  the  low-energy  point-particle
approximations to the type iia string, the type iib string, and the heterotic-e string. the fourth gives
the the low-energy point-particle approximation to both the type i string and the heterotic-o string;
in retrospect, this was the first indication of the close connection between these two string theories.

this is a very tidy story except that eleven-dimensional supergravity seems to have been left out
in  the  cold.  string  theory,  formulated  in  ten  dimensions,  appears  to  have  no  room  for  an  eleven-
dimensional theory. for a number of years, the general view held by most but not all string theorists
was that eleven-dimensional supergravity was a mathematical oddity without any connection to the
physics of string theory.12

ent. at strings '95, witten argued that if we start with the type iia string
and increase its coupling constant from a value much less than 1 to a value much greater than 1, the
physics we are still able to analyze (essentially that of the bps saturated configurations) has a low-
energy approximation that is eleven-dimensional supergravity.

when witten announced this discovery, it stunned the audience and it has since rocked the string
theory community. for almost everyone in the field, it was a completely unexpected development.
your first reaction to this result may echo that of most experts in the field: how can a theory specific
to eleven dimensions be relevant to a different theory in ten?

the  answer  is  of  deep  significance.  to  understand  it,  we  must  describe  witten's  result  more
precisely. actually, it's easier first to illustrate a closely related result discovered later by witten and

they found that the strongly coupled heterotic-e string also has an eleven-dimensional description,
and figure 12.7 shows why. in the leftmost part of the figure, we take the heterotic-e string coupling
constant  to  be  much  smaller  than  1.  this  is  the  realm  that  we  have  been  describing  in  previous
chapters and that string theorists have studied for well over a decade. as we move to the right in
figure 12.7, we sequentially increase the size of the coupling constant. prior to 1995, string theorists
knew that this would make the loop processes (see figure 12.6) increasingly important and, as the
coupling constant got larger, would ultimately invalidate the whole perturbative framework. but what
no one suspected is that as the coupling constant is made larger, a new dimension becomes visible!
this  is  the  "vertic

al"  dimension  shown  in  figure  12.7.  bear  in  mind  that  in  this  figure  the  two-
dimensional  grid  with  which  we  begin  represents  all  nine  spatial  dimensions  of  the  heterotic-e
string. thus, the new, vertical dimension represents a tenth spatial dimension, which, together with
time, takes us to a total of eleven spacetime dimensions.

moreover, figure 12.7 illustrates a profound consequence of this new dimension. the structure
of the heterotic-e string changes as this dimension grows. it is stretched from a one-dimensional loop
into a ribbon and then a deformed cylinder as we increase the size of the coupling constant! in other

words,  the  heterotic-e  string  is actually a  two-dimensional  membrane  whose  width  (the  vertical
extent in figure 12.7) is controlled by the size of the coupling constant. for over a decade, string
theorists  have  always  used  perturbative  methods  that  are  firmly  rooted  in  the  assumption  that  the

 
 ___________________________
 
coupling  constant  is  very  small.  as  argued  by  witten,  this  assumption  has  made  the  fundamental
ingredients look and behave like one-dimensional strings even though they actually have a hidden,
second  spatial  dimension.  by  relaxing  the  assumption  that  the  coupling  constant  is  very  small  and
considering  the  physics  of  the  heterotic-e  string  when  the  coupling  constant  is  large,  the  second
dimension becomes manifest.

figure 12.7 as the heterotic-e string coupling constant is increased, a new space dimension appears
and the string itself gets stretched into a cylindrical membrane shape.

this realization does not invalidate any of the conclusions we have drawn in previous chapters,
but it does force us to see them within a new framework. for instance, how does this all mesh with
the one time and nine space dimensions required by string theory? well, recall from chapter 8 that
this  constraint  arises  from  counting  the  number  of  independent
 
 ___________________________
 
  directions  in  which  a  string  can
vibrate, and requiring that this number be just right to ensure that quantum-mechanical probabilities
have sensible values. the new dimension we have just uncovered is not one in which a heterotic-e
string  can  vibrate,  since  it  is  a  dimension  that  is  locked  within  the  structure  of  the  "strings"
themselves.  put  another  way,  the  perturbative  framework  that  physicists  used  in  deriving  the
requirement  of  a  ten-dimensional  spacetime  assumed  from  the  outset  that  the  heterotic-e  coupling
constant  is  small.  although  it  was  not  recognized  until  much  later,  this  implicitly  enforced  two
mutually consistent approximations: that the width of the membrane in figure 12.7 is small, making it
look like a string, and that the eleventh dimension is so small that i
 
 ___________________________
 
t is beyond the sensitivity of the
perturbative equations. within this approximation scheme, we are led to envision a ten-dimensional
universe  filled  with  one-dimensional  strings.  now  we  see  that  this  is  but  an  approximation  to  an
eleven-dimensional universe containing two-dimensional membranes.

for technical reasons, witten first came upon the eleventh dimension in his studies of the strong
coupling properties of the type iia string, and there the story is quite similar. as in the heterotic-e
example, there is an eleventh dimension whose size is controlled by the type iia coupling constant.
when its value is increased, the new dimension grows. as it does, witten argued, the type iia string,
rather  than  stretching  into  a  ribbon  as  in  the  heterotic-e  case,  expands  into  an  "inner  tube,"  as
illustrated in figure 12.8. once again, witten argued that although theorists have always viewed type
iia strings as one-d

imensional objects, having only length but no thickness, this view is a reflection
of  the  perturbative  approximation  scheme  in  which  the  string  coupling  constant  is  assumed  to  be
small.  if  nature does  require  a  small  value  of  this  coupling  constant  then  it  is  a  trustworthy
approximation.  nevertheless,  witten's  arguments  and  those  of  other  physicists  during  the  second
superstring  revolution  do  give  strong  evidence  that  the  type  iia  and  heterotic-e  "strings"  are,
fundamentally, two-dimensional membranes living in an eleven-dimensional universe.

but  what is  this  eleven-dimensional  theory?  at  low  energies  (low  compared  to  the  planck

energy),  witten  and  others  argued,  it  is  approximated  by  the  long-neglected  eleven-dimensional
supergravity quantum field theory. but for higher energies, how can we describe this theory? this

beyond  a  hodgepodge  of  properties, no  one  knows  what  this  eleven-dimensional  theory  is.  are
membranes  its  fundamental  ingredients?  what  are  its  defining  properties?  how  does  it  purport  to
make contact with physics as we know it? if the respective coupling constants are small, our best
current  answers  to  these  questions  are  described  in  previous  chapters,  since  at  small  coupling
constants we are led back to the theory of strings. but if the coupling constants are not small, no one
currently knows the answers.

figure  12.8  as  the  type  iia  string  coupling  constant  is  increased,  strings  expand  from  one-
dimensional loops to two-dimensional objects that look like the surface of a bicycle-tire inner tube.

whatever  the  eleven-dimensional  theory  is,  witten  has  provisionally  named  it m-theory.  the
name stands for as many things as people you poll. some samples: mystery theory, mother theory
(as in "mo

theories"), membrane theory (since, whatever it is, membranes seem to be part
of  the  story),  matrix  theory  (after  some  recent  work  by  tom  banks  of  rutgers  university,  willy
fischler of the university of texas at austin, stephen shenker of rutgers university, and susskind
that offers a novel interpretation of the theory). but even without having a firm grasp on its name or its
properties, it is already clear that m-theory provides a unifying substrate for pulling together all five
string theories.

m-theory and the web of interconnections

there is an old proverb about three blind men and an elephant. the first blind man grabs hold of the
elephant's ivory tusk and describes the smooth, hard surface that he feels. the second blind man grabs
hold of one of the elephant's legs. he describes the tough, muscular girth that he feels. the third blind
man grabs hold of the elephant's tail and describes the slender and sinewy appendage that he feels.
since their mutual descriptions are 
 
 ___________________________
 
so different, and since none of the men can see the others, each
thinks that he has grabbed hold of a different animal. for many years, physicists were as much in the
dark as the blind men, thinking that the different string theories were very different. but now, through
the insights of the second superstring revolution, physicists have realized that m-theory is the unifying
pachyderm of the five string theories.

in this chapter we have discussed changes in our understanding of string theory that arise when
we venture beyond the domain of the perturbative framework—a framework implicitly in use prior to
this chapter. figure 12.9 summarizes the interrelations we have found so far, with arrows to indicate

dual  theories. as  you  can  see,  we  have  a  web  of  connections,  but  it  is  not  yet  complete.  by  also
including the dualities of chapter 10, we can finish the job.

recall the large/small circular radius duality that interchanges a circular dimension of radiu
 
 ___________________________
 
s r
with one whose radius is 1/r. previously, we glossed over one aspect of this duality, which we now
must  clarify.  in  chapter  10,  we  discussed  the  properties  of  strings  in  a  universe  with  a  circular
dimension without carefully specifying which of the five string formulations we were working with.
we  argued  that  the  interchange  of  winding  and  vibration  modes  of  a  string  allows  us  to  rephrase
exactly the string theoretic description of a universe with a circular dimension of radius 1/r in terms
of one in which the radius is r. the point we glossed over is that the type iia and type iib string
theories actually get exchanged by this duality, as do the heterotic-o and heterotic-e strings. that is,
the more precise statement of the large/small radius duality is this: the physics of the type iia string
in a universe with a circular dimension of radius r is absolutely identical to the physics of the type
i

ib string in a universe with a circular dimension of radius 1/r  (a  similar  statement  holds  for  the
heterotic-e  and  heterotic-o  strings).  this  refinement  of  the  large/small  radius  duality  has  no
significant effect on the conclusions of chapter 10, but it does have an important impact on the present
discussion.

figure 12.9 the arrows show which theories are dual to others.

the reason is that by providing a link between the type iia and type iib string theories, as well
as  between  the  heterotic-o  and  heterotic-e  theories,  the  large/small  radius  duality  completes  the
web of connections, as illustrated by the dotted lines in figure 12.10. this figure shows that all five
string theories, together with m-theory, are dual to one another. they are all sewn together into a
single theoretical framework; they provide five different approaches to describing one and the same
underlying  physics.  for  some  or  other  application,  one  phra

sing  may  be  far  more  effective  than
another. for instance, it's far easier to work with the weakly coupled heterotic-o theory than it is to
work with the strongly coupled type i string. nevertheless, they describe exactly the same physics.

figure 12.10 by including the dualities involving the geometrical form of spacetime (as in chapter
10), all five of the string theories and m-theory are joined together in a web of dualities.

the overall picture

we can now more fully understand the two figures—figures 12.1 and 12.2—that we introduced in the
beginning of this chapter to summarize the essential points. in figure 12.1 we see that prior to 1995,

without  taking  any  dualities  into  account,  we  had  five  apparently  distinct  string  theories.  various
physicists worked on each, but without an understanding of the dualities they appeared to be

till have five disjointed (collections of) theories.

but now, if we apply all of the dualities we have discussed, then as we vary the coupling and
geometric parameters, we can pass from any one theory to any other, so long as we also include the
unifying central region of m-theory; this is shown in figure 12.2. even though we have only a scant
understanding of m-theory, these indirect arguments lend strong support to the claim that it provides a
unifying substrate for our five naively distinct string theories. moreover, we have learned that m-
theory is closely related to yet a sixth theory—eleven-dimensional supergravity—and this is recorded
in figure 12.11, a more precise version of figure 12.2.13

figure  12.11  illustrates  that  the  fundamental  ideas  and  equations  of  m-theory,  although  only
partially understood at the moment, unify those of all of the formulations of string theory. m-theory is

to  a  far  grander  unifying
framework.

figure 12.11 by incorporating the dualities, all five string theories, eleven-dimensional supergravity,
and m-theory are merged together into a unified framework.

a surprising feature of m-theory: democracy in extension

when the string coupling constant is small in any of the upper five peninsular regions of the theory
map in figure 12.11, the fundamental ingredient of the theory appears to be a one-dimensional string.
we  have,  however,  just  gained  a  new  perspective  on  this  observation.  if  we  start  in  either  the
heterotic-e or type iia regions and turn the value of the respective string coupling constants up, we
migrate  toward  the  center  of  the  map  in  figure  12.11,  and  what  appeared  to  be  one-dimensional
strings stretch into two-dimensional membranes. moreover, through a more or less intricate sequence

of duality relations involving both the string coupling constants and the

detailed form of the curled-up
spatial dimensions, we can smoothly and continuously move from any point in figure 12.11 to any
other. since the two-dimensional membranes we have come upon from the heterotic-e and type iia
perspectives can be followed as we migrate to any of the three other string formulations in figure
12.11,  we  learn  that  each  of  the  five  string  formulations  involves  two-dimensional  membranes  as
well.

this raises two questions. first, are two-dimensional membranes the true fundamental ingredient
of string theory? and second, having made the bold leap in the 1970s and early 1980s from zero-
dimensional  point  particles  to  one-dimensional  strings,  and  having  now  seen  that  string  theory
actually  involves  two-dimensional  membranes,  might  it  be  that  there  are  even  higher-dimensional
ingredients  in  the  theory  
 
 ___________________________
 
as  well? as  of  this  writing,  the  answers  to  these  questions  are  not  fully
known, but the situation appears to be the following.

we relied heavily on supersymmetry to give us some understanding of each formulation of string
theory  beyond  the  domain  of  validity  of  perturbative  approximation  methods.  in  particular,  the
properties  of  bps  states,  their  masses  and  their  force  charges,  are  uniquely  determined  by
supersymmetry,  and  this  allowed  us  to  understand  some  of  their  strongly  coupled  characteristics
without having to perform direct calculations of unimaginable difficulty. in fact, through the initial
efforts of horowitz and strominger, and through subsequent groundbreaking wor

k of polchinski, we
now know even more about these bps states. in particular, not only do we know their masses and the
force  charges  they  carry,  but  we  also  have  a  clear  understanding  of  what  they look  like. and  the
picture  is,  perhaps,  the  most  surprising  development  of  all.  some  of  the  bps  states  are  one-
dimensional strings. others are two-dimensional membranes. by now, these shapes are familiar. but,
the  surprise  is  that  yet  others  are three-dimensional, four-dimensional—in  fact,  the  range  of
possibilities  encompasses  every  spatial  dimension  up  to  and  including nine.  string  theory  or  m-
theory, or whatever it is finally called, actually contains extended objects of a whole slew of different
spatial  dimensions.  physicists  have  coined  the  term  three-brane  to  describe  extended  obj

ects  with
three  spatial  dimensions,  four-brane  for  those  with  four  spatial  dimensions,  and  so  on  up  to  nine-
branes  (and,  more  generally,  for  an  object  with p  space  dimensions,  where p  represents  a  whole
number, physicists have coined the far from euphonious terminology p-brane). sometimes, using this
terminology, strings are described as one-branes, and membranes as two-branes. the fact that all of
these extended objects are actually part of the theory has led paul townsend to declare a "democracy
of branes."

notwithstanding brane democracy, strings—one-dimensional extended objects—are special for
the following reason. physicists have shown that the mass of the extended objects of every dimension
except  for  one-dimensional  strings  is inversely  proportional  to  the  value  of  the  associated  string

coupling constant when we are in any of the five string regions of figure 12.11. this means that with
weak string coupling, in any of the five formulations, all but the strings will be enormously massive—
orders of magnitude heavier than the planck mass. because they are so heavy and, therefore, from e =
mc2, require such unimaginably high energy to be produced, branes have only a small effect on much
of physics (but not on all, as we shall see in the next chapter). however, when we venture outside the
peninsular  regions  of  figure  12.11,  the  higher-dimensional  branes  become  lighter  and  hence
increasingly important.14

and  so,  the  image  you  should  h

ave  in  mind  is  the  following.  in  the  central  region  of  figure
12.11, we have a theory whose fundamental ingredients are not just strings or membranes, but rather
"branes" of a variety of dimensions, all more or less on equal footing. currently, we do not have a

firm grasp on many essential features of this full theory. but one thing we do know is that as we move
from the central region to any of the peninsular regions, only the strings (or membranes curled up to
look  ever  more  like  strings,  as  in  figures  12.7  and  12.8)  are  light  enough  to  make  contact  with
physics as we know it—the particles of table 1.1 and the four forces through which they interact. the
perturbative analyses string theorists have made use of for close to two decades have not been refined
enough  to  discover  even  the  existence  of  the  super-massive  extended  objects  of  other  dimensions;
strings  dominated  the  analyses  and  t

he  theory  was  given  the  far-from-democratic  name  of  string
theory. again, in these regions of figure 12.11 we are justified, for most considerations, in ignoring
all but the strings. in essence, this is what we have done so far in this book. we see now, though, that
in actuality the theory is more rich than anyone previously imagined.

does any of this solve the unanswered questions in string theory?

yes and no. we have managed to deepen our understanding by breaking free of certain conclusions
that, in retrospect, were a consequence of perturbative approximate analyses rather than true string
physics.  but  the  current  scope  of  our  nonperturbative  tools  is  quite  limited.  the  discovery  of  the
remarkable web of duality relations affords us far greater insight into string theory, but many issues
remain  unresolved. at  present,  for  example,  we  do  not  know  how  to

 go  beyond  the  approximate
equations  for  the  value  of  the  string  coupling  constant—equations  that,  as  we  have  seen,  are  too
coarse  to  give  us  any  useful  information.  nor  do  we  have  any  greater  insight  into  why  there  are
precisely  three  extended  spatial  dimensions,  or  how  to  choose  the  detailed  form  for  the  curled-up
dimensions. these questions require more sharply honed nonperturbative methods than we currently
possess.

tring theory. prior to the realizations summarized in figure 12.11, the strong coupling behavior of
each  string  theory  was  a  black  box,  a  complete  mystery. as  on  maps  of  old,  the  realm  of  strong
coupling was uncharted territory, potentially filled with dragons and sea monsters. but now we see
that although the journey to strong coupling may take us through unfamiliar regions of m-theory, it
ultimately lands us back in the comfortable surrounds of weak coupling—albeit in the dual language
of what was once thought to be a different string theory.

discovery. once a cartographer can fill in every region on a spherical globe of the earth, the map is
done and geographical knowledge is complete. that's not to say explorations in antarctica or on an
isolated island in micronesia are without scientific or cultural merit. it only means that the age of
geographic discovery is over. the absence of blank spots on the globe ensures this. the "theory map"
of figure 12.11 plays a similar role for string theorists. it covers the entire range of theories that can
be reached by setting sail from any one of the five string constructions. although we are far from a
full understanding of the terra incognita of m-theory, there are no blank regions on the map. like the
cartographer, the string theorist can now claim with guarded optimism that the spectrum of logically

the challenge to the string theorist—or perhaps we should say the m-theorist—is to show that

some point on the theory map of figure 12.11 actually describes our universe. to do this requires
finding the full and exact equations whose solution will pick out this elusive point on the map, and
then  understanding  the  corresponding  physics  with  sufficient  precision  to  allow  comparisons  with
experiment. as witten has said, "understanding what m-theory really is—the physics it embodies—

black holes: a string/m-theory perspective

the pre–string theory conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics was an affront to
our visceral sense that the laws of nature should fit together in a seamless, coherent whole. but this
antagonism  was  more  than  a  towering  abstract  disjunction.  the  extreme  physical  conditions  that
occurred  at  the  moment  of  the  big  bang  and  that  prevail  within  black  holes cannot  be  understood
without  a  quantum  mechanical  formulation  of  the  gravitational  force.  with  the  discov

theory, we now have a hope of solving these deep mysteries. in this and the next chapter, we describe
how far string theorists have gone toward understanding black holes and the origin of the universe.

black holes and elementary particles

at  first  sight  it's  hard  to  imagine  any  two  things  more  radically  different  than  black  holes  and
elementary  particles.  we  usually  picture  black  holes  as  the  most  gargantuan  of  heavenly  bodies,
whereas elementary particles are the most minute specks of matter. but the research of a number of
physicists during the late 1960s and early 1970s, incl

 of a proton. from the point of view of black holes, though, the planck mass,
being equal to that of an average grain of dust, is quite tiny.) and so, physicists who speculated that
tiny  black  holes  and  elementary  particles  might  be  closely  related  immediately  ran  up  against  the
incompatibility  between  general  relativity—the  theoretical  heart  of  black  holes—and  quantum
mechanics. in the past, the incompatibility stymied all progress in this intriguing direction.

does string theory allow us to go forward?

it  does.  through  a  fairly  unexpected  and  sophisticated  realization  of  black  holes,  string  theory
provides the first theoretically sound connection between black holes and elementary particles. the
road  to  this  connection  is  a  bit  circuitous,  but  it  takes  us  through  some  of  the  most  interesting
developments in string theory, making it a journey well worth taking.

it begins with a seemingly unrelated question that string theorists hav

but we are now imagining having one more space dimension: a four-dimensional beach ball whose
surface  is three-dimensional. as it's pretty close to impossible to picture such a beach ball in your
mind's  eye,  for  the  most  part  we  will  appeal  to  lower-dimensional  analogs  that  are  more  easily
visualized.  but,  as  we  shall  now  see,  one  aspect  of  the  three-dimensional  nature  of  the  spherical
surfaces is of prime importance.

by studying the equations of string theory, physicists realized that it is possible, and even likely,
that  as  time  evolves,  these  three-dimensional  spheres  will  shrink—collapse—to  vanishingly  small
volume. but what would happen, string theorists asked, if the fabric of space were to collapse in this
manner? will there be some catastrophic effect from this kind of pinching of the spatial fabric? this
is  much  like  the  question  we  posed  and  resolved  in  chapter  11,  but  here  we  are  focusing  on
collapsing

 three-dimensional spheres, whereas in chapter 11 we focused solely on collapsing two-
dimensional spheres. (as in chapter 11, since we are envisioning that a piece of a calabi-yau shape
is  shrinking,  as  opposed  to  the  whole  calabi-yau  shape  itself,  the  small  radius/large  radius
identification of chapter 10 does not apply.) here is the essential qualitative difference arising from

the change in dimension.1 we recall from chapter 11 that a pivotal realization is that strings, as they
move through space, can lasso a two-dimensional sphere. that is, their two-dimensional world-sheet
can  fully  surround  a  two-dimensional  sphere,  as  in  figure  11.6.  this  proves  to  be  just  enough
protection to keep a collapsing, pinching two-dimensional sphere from causing physical catastrophes.
but now we are looking at the other kind of sphere inside a calabi-yau space, and it has too many
dimensions for it to be surrounded by a moving string. if you have trouble seeing

this, it is perfectly
okay  to  think  of  the  analogy  obtained  by  lowering  all  dimensions  by  one. you  can  picture  three-
dimensional spheres as if they are two-dimensional surfaces of ordinary beach balls, so long as you
also picture one-dimensional strings as if they are zero-dimensional point particles. then, in analogy
with the fact that a zero-dimensional point-particle cannot lasso anything, let alone a two-dimensional
sphere, a one-dimensional string cannot lasso a three-dimensional sphere.

such  reasoning  led  string  theorists  to  speculate  that  if  a  three-dimensional  sphere  inside  a
calabi-yau  space  were  to  collapse,  something  that  the  approximate  equations  showed  to  be  a
perfectly possible if not commonplace evolution in string theory, it might yield a cataclysmic result.
in  fact,  the  approximate  equations  of  string  theory  developed  prior  to  the  mid-1990s  seemed  to
indicate that the workings of the u

niverse would grind to a halt if such a collapse were to occur; they
indicated that certain of the infinities tamed by string theory would be unleashed by such a pinching of
the  spatial  fabric.  for  a  number  of  years,  string  theorists  had  to  live  with  this  disturbing,  albeit
inconclusive, state of understanding. but in 1995, andrew strominger showed that these doomsaying
speculations were wrong.

time later.

strominger,  following  earlier  groundbreaking  work  of  witten  and  seiberg,  made  use  of  the
realization that string theory, when analyzed with the newfound precision of the second superstring
revolution,  is  not  just  a  theory  of  one-dimensional  strings.  he  reasoned  as  follows.  a  o

dimensional string—a one-brane in the newer language of the field—can completely surround a one-
dimensional piece of space, like a circle, as we illustrate in figure 13.1. (notice that this is different
from  figure  11.6,  in  which  a  one-dimensional  string,  as  it  moves  through  time,  lassos  a  two-
dimensional  sphere.  figure  13.1  should  be  viewed  as  a  snapshot  taken  at  one  instant  in  time.)
similarly, in figure 13.1 we see that a two-dimensional membrane—a two-brane—can wrap around
and  completely  cover  a  two-dimensional  sphere,  much  as  a  piece  of  plastic  wrap  can  be  tightly
wrapped around the surface of an orange. although it's harder to visualize, strominger followed the
pattern  and  realized  that  the  
 
 ___________________________
 
newly  discovered  three-dimensional  ingredients  in  string  theory—the
three-branes—can wrap around and completely cover a three-dimensional sphere. having seen clear
to  this  insight,  strominger  then  showed,  with  a  simple  and  standard  physics  calculation,  that  the
wrapped  three-brane  provides  a  tailor-made  shield  that  exactly  cancels  all  of  the  potentially
cataclysmic  effects  that  string  theorists  had  previously  feared  would  occur  if  a  three-dimensional
sphere were to collapse.

this was a wonderful and important insight. but its full power was not revealed until a short

overnight. the morning after strominger posted his paper on the electronic internet archive, i read it
in my office at cornell after having retrieved it from the world wide web. in one stroke, strominger
had  made  use  of  the  exciting  new  insights  of  string  theory  to  resolve  one  of  the  thorniest  issues
surrounding the curling up of extra dimensions into a calabi-yau space. but as i pondered his paper,
it struck me that he might have worked out only half of the story.

in the earlier space-tearing flop-transition work described in chapter 11, we had studied a two-
part process in which a two-dimensional sphere pinches down to a point, causing the fabric of space
to tear, and then the two-dimensional sphere reinflates in a new way, thereby r

strominger's paper, he had studied what happens when a three-dimensional sphere pinches down to a
point, and had shown that the newfound extended objects in string theory ensure that physics continues
to be perfectly well behaved. but that's where his paper stopped. might it be that there was another
half  to  the  story,  involving,  once  again,  the  tearing  of  space  and  its  subsequent  repair  through  the
reinflation of spheres?

dave morrison was visiting me at cornell during the spring term of 1995, and that afternoon we
got together to discuss strominger's paper. within a couple of hours we had an outline of what the
"second  half  of  the  s

sphere inside a calabi-yau space, it seemed to us that space could tear and subsequently repair itself
by growing a two-dimensional sphere, leading to far more drastic changes in topology than witten
and we had found in our earlier work (discussed in chapter 11). in this way, one calabi-yau shape
could,  in  essence,  transform  itself  into  a  completely  different  calabi-yau  shape—much  like  the
doughnut  transforming  into  the  beach  ball  in  figure  13.3—while  string  physics  remained  perfectly
well behaved. although a picture was starting to emerge, we knew that there were significant aspects
that we would need to work out before we could establish that our second half of the story did not
introduce any singularities—that is, pernicious and physically unacceptable consequences. we each
went home that evening with the tentative elation that we were sitting on a major new insight.

the next morning i received an e-mail from strominge

within an hour, we resubmitted the paper, and agreed not to talk about it at all during the drive to
morrison's house.

by  early  the  next  afternoon  it  was  evident  that  the  response  to  our  paper  was  enthusiastic.
among the many e-mail responses was one from plesser, who gave us one of the highest compliments
one physicist can give another by declaring, "i wish that i had thought of that!" notwithstanding our
fears the previous night, we had convinced the string theory community that not only can the fabric of
space undergo the mild tears discovered earlier (chapter 11), but that far more drastic rips, roughly
illustrated by figure 13.3, can occur as well.

returning to black holes and elementary particles

what does this have to do with black holes and elementary particles? a lot. to see this, we must ask
ourselves the same question we posed in chapter 11. what are the observable physical consequences
of such tears in the fabric of space? for flop tr

the  volume  of  the  sphere,  the
smaller the mass of the three-brane that wraps it. as this sphere collapses, then, a three-brane that
wraps around the sphere, which is perceived as a black hole, appears to become ever lighter. when
the three-dimensional sphere has collapsed to a pinched point, the corresponding black hole—brace
yourself—is massless. although it sounds completely mysterious—what in the world is a massless
black hole?—we will soon connect this enigma with more familiar string physics.

figure 13.4 when a brane wraps around a sphere that is within the curled-up dimensions, it appears
as a black hole in the familiar extended dimensions.

the second ingredient we need to recall is that the number of holes in a calabi-yau shape, as
discussed in chapter 9, determines the number of low-energy, and hence low-mass, vibrational string
patterns,  the  patterns  that  can  possibly  account  for  the  particles  in  table  1.1  as  well  as  the  force
carriers. since the spa

earing conifold transitions change the number of holes (as, for example in
figure  13.3,  in  which  the  hole  of  the  doughnut  is  eliminated  by  the  tearing/repairing  process),  we
expect a change in the number of low-mass vibrational patterns. indeed, when morrison, strominger,
and  i  studied  this  in  detail,  we  found  that  as  a  new  two-dimensional  sphere  replaces  the  pinched
three-dimensional  sphere  in  the  curled-up  calabi-yau  dimensions,  the  number  of  massless  string
vibrational patterns increases by exactly one. (the example of the doughnut turning into a beach ball
in figure 13.3 would lead you to believe that the number of holes—and thus the number of patterns—
decreases, but this proves to be a misleading property of the lower-dimensional analogy.)

to combine the observations of the preceding two paragraphs, imagine a sequence of snapshots
of a calabi-yau space in which the size of a particular three-dimensional sphere gets smaller and

e  first  observation  implies  that  a  three-brane  wrapping  around  this  three-dimensional
sphere—which appears to us as a black hole—will have ever smaller mass until, at the final point of
collapse, it will be massless. but, as we asked above, what does this mean? the answer became
clear to us by invoking the second observation. our work showed that the new massless pattern of
string vibration arising from the space-tearing conifold transition is the microscopic description of a
massless particle into which the black hole has transmuted.  we  concluded  that  as  a  calabi-yau
shape goes through a space-tearing conifold transition, an initially massive black hole becomes ever
lighter until it is massless and then it transmutes into a massless particle—such as a massless photon

ern. in this
way,  for  the  first  time,  string  theory  explicitly  establishes  a  direct,  concrete,  and  quantitatively
unassailable connection between black holes and elementary particles.

"melting" black holes

the  connection  between  black  holes  and  elementary  particles  which  we  found  is  closely  akin  to
something we are all familiar with from day-to-day life, known technically as a phase transition. a
simple example of a phase transition is the one we mentioned in the last chapter: water can exist as a
solid (ice), as a
 
 ___________________________
 
a tight mathematical and physical analogy between such phase transitions and the
space-tearing conifold transitions from one calabi-yau shape to another. again, just as someone who
has never before encountered liquid water or solid ice would not immediately recognize that they are
two phases of the same underlying substance, physicists had not realized previously that the kinds of
black  holes  we  were  studying  and  elementary  particles  are  actually  two  phases  of  the  same
underlying  stringy  material.  whereas  the  surrounding  temperature  determines  the  phase  in  which
water will exist, the topological form—the shape—of the extra calabi-yau dimensions determines
whether  certain  physical  configurations  within  string  theory  appear  as  black  holes  or  elementary
particles. that is, in the first phase, the initial calabi-yau shape (the analog of the ice phase, say), we
find that there are certain black holes present. in the second phase, the second calabi-yau shap

e (the
analog of the liquid water phase), these black holes have gone through a phase transition—they have
"melted"  so  to  speak—into  fundamental  vibrational  string  patterns.  the  tearing  of  space  through

conifold transitions takes us from one calabi-yau phase to the other. in so doing, we see that black
holes and elementary particles, like water and ice, are two sides of the same coin. we see that black
holes snugly fit within the framework of string theory.

we have purposely used the same water analogy for these drastic space-tearing transmutations
and for the transmutations from one of the five formulations of string theory to another (chapter 12)
because they are deeply connected. recall that we expressed through figure 12.11 that the five string
theories  are  dual  to  one  another  and  thereby  are  unified  under  the  rubric  of  a  single  overarching
theory. but does the ability to move continuously from one description to anoth

bi-yau shape or another? prior to the discovery of the drastic
topology-changing  results,  the  anticipated  answer  was  no,  since  there  was  no  known  way  to
continuously deform one calabi-yau shape into any other. but now we see that the answer is yes:
through these physically sensible space-tearing conifold transitions, we can continuously change any
given  calabi-yau  space  into  any  other.  by  varying  coupling  constants  and  curled-up  calabi-yau
geometry,  we  see  that  all  string  constructions  are,  once  again,  different  phases  of  a  single  theory.
even after curling up all extra dimensions, the unity of figure 12.11 firmly holds.

black hole entropy

for many years, some of the most accomplished theoretical physicists speculated about the possibility
of  space-tearing  processes  and  of  a  connection  between  black  holes  and  elementary  particles.
although such speculations might have sounded like science fiction at first, the discovery of string
theory, 
 
 ___________________________
 
with its ability to merge general relativity and quantum mechanics, has allowed us now to
plant these possibilities firmly at the forefront of cutting-edge science. this success emboldens us to
ask  whether  any  of  the  other  mysterious  properties  of  our  universe  that  have  stubbornly  resisted
resolution for decades might also succumb to the powers of string theory. foremost among these is the
notion of black hole entropy. this is the arena in which string theory has most impressively flexed its
muscles, successfully solving a quarter-century-old problem of profound significance.

entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. for instance, if your desk is cluttered high with
layer upon layer of open books, half-read articles, old newspapers, and junk mail, it is in a state of
high disorder, or high entropy. on the other hand, if it is fully organized with articles in alphabetized
folders, newspapers neatly stacked in chronological order, books 
 
 ___________________________
 
 quantum mechanics could be used to
find the numerical value of a black hole's entropy, but offered no insight into its microscopic meaning.
for nearly a quarter of a century, some of the greatest physicists tried to understand what possible
microscopic properties of black holes could account for their entropy. but without a fully trustworthy
amalgam  of  quantum  mechanics  and  general  relativity,  glimpses  of  an  answer  may  have  been
uncovered, but the mystery remained unsolved.

enter string theory

or, it did until january 1996, when strominger and vafa—building on earlier insights of susskind and
sen—released  a  paper  to  the  electronic  physics  archive  entitled  "microscopic  origin  of  the
beckenstein-hawking entropy." in this work, strominger and vafa were able to use string theory to
identify the microscopic constituents of a certain class of black holes and to calculate precisely their
associated entropy. their work relied on the newfound ability to partially circu
 
 ___________________________
 
ng  with  a  particular  collection  of  bps  branes  (of  certain
specified  dimensions)  and  binding  them  together  according  to  a  precise  mathematical  blueprint.  in
much  the  same  way  that  an  atom  can  be  built—theoretically,  again—by  starting  with  a  bunch  of

quarks  and  electrons  and  then  precisely  arranging  them  into  protons  and  neutrons,  surrounded  by
orbiting  electrons,  strominger  and  vafa  showed  how  some  of  the  newfound  ingredients  in  string
theory could similarly be molded together to yield particular black holes.

in  actuality,  black  holes  are  one  possible  end  product  of  stellar  evolution.  after  a  star  has
burned all its nuclear fuel through billions of years of atomic fusion, it no longer has the strength—the
outward-directed  pressure—to  withstand  the  enormous  inward  force  of  gravity.  under  a  broad
spectrum  of  conditions,  this  results  in  a  cataclysmic  implosion  of  the  star's  enormous  ma

ss;  it
violently collapses under its own tremendous weight, forming a black hole. contrary to this realistic
means of formation, strominger and vafa advocated "designer" black holes. they turned the tables on
black  hole  formation  by  showing  how  they  could  be  systematically  constructed—in  a  theorist's
imagination—by carefully, slowly, and meticulously weaving together a precise combination of the
branes that had emerged from the second superstring revolution.

the power of this approach became immediately clear. by maintaining full theoretical control
over the microscopic construction of their black holes, strominger and vafa could easily and directly
count the number of rearrangements of the black hole's microscopic constituents that would leave its
overall observable properties, its mass and force charges, unchanged. they could then compare this
number with the area of the black hole's horizon—the entropy predicted by bekenstein and

hawking.
when strominger and vafa did so, they found perfect agreement. at least for the class of extremal
black holes, they had succeeded in using string theory to account for the microscopic constituents and
the associated entropy precisely. a quarter-century-old puzzle had been solved.6

many  string  theorists  view  this  success  as  an  important  and  convincing  piece  of  evidence  in
support of the theory. our understanding of string theory is still too coarse to be able to make direct
and precise contact with experimental observations of, say, the mass of a quark or an electron. but we
now  see  that  string  theory  has  provided  the  first  fundamental  explanation  of  a  long-established
property of black holes that has stumped physicists using more conventional theories for many years.
and  this  property  of  black  holes  is  intimately  tied  up  with  hawking's  prediction  that  they  should
radiate, a predictio

n that, in principle, should be experimentally measurable. of course, this requires
that we definitively find a black hole in the heavens and then construct equipment sensitive enough to
detect the radiation that it emits. if the black hole were light enough, the latter step is well within the
reach of current technology. even though this experimental program has not as yet met with success, it
does re-emphasize that the chasm between string theory and definitive physical statements about the
natural  world  can  be  bridged.  even  sheldon  glashow—the  archrival  of  string  theory  through  the
1980s—has said recently, "when string theorists talk about black holes they are almost talking about
observable phenomena—and that is impressive."7

the remaining mysteries of black holes

even  with  these  impressive  developments,  there  are  still  two  central  mysteries  surrounding  black
holes. the first concerns the impact

the  bet  remains  unsettled,  but  hawking  has  recently  acknowledged  that  the  newfound
understanding of black holes from string theory, as discussed above, shows that there might be a way
for  the  information  to  re-emerge.10  the  new  idea  is  that  for  the  kind  of  black  holes  studied  by
strominger and vafa, and by many other physicists since their initial paper, information can be stored
and recovered from the constituent branes. this insight, strominger recently said, "has led some string
theorists  to  want  to  claim  victory—to  claim  that  the  information  is  recovered  as  black  holes

where time in our universe comes to an end, time in the attached universe just begins.

we will take up some of the implications of this mind-boggling possibility in the next chapter,

but for now we want to stress one important point. we must recall the central lesson: extremes of
huge mass and small size leading to unimaginably large density invalidate the sole use of einstein's
classical theory and require that quantum mechanics be brought to bear as well. this leads us to ask,
what does string theory have to say about the spacetime singularity at the center of a black hole? this
is a topic of intense current research, but as with the question of information loss, it has not yet been
settled. string theory deftly deals with a variety of other singularities—the rips and tears in space
discussed in chapter 11 and in the first part of this chapter. 15 but if you have seen one singularity you
have not  seen  them  all.  the  fabric  of  our  universe  can  be  ripped,  punctured,  and

torn  in  many
different  ways.  string  theory  has  given  us  profound  insights  into  some  of  these  singularities,  but
others,  the  black  hole  singularity  among  them,  have  so  far  eluded  the  string  theorists'  reach.  the
essential  reason  for  this,  once  again,  is  the  reliance  on  perturbative  tools  in  string  theory  whose
approximations, in this case, cloud our ability to analyze reliably and fully what happens at the deep
interior point of a black hole.

however, given the recent tremendous progress in nonperturbative methods and their successful
application  to  other  aspects  of  black  holes,  string  theorists  have  high  hopes  that  it  won't  be  long
before the mysteries residing at the center of black holes start to unravel.

 framework  is  emerging  for
answering some of these questions scientifically.

the currently accepted scientific theory of creation declares that the universe experienced the
most  extreme  of  conditions—enormous  energy,  temperature,  and  density—during  its  earliest
moments. these conditions, as is by now familiar, require that both quantum mechanics and gravity be
taken into account, and hence the birth of the universe provides a profound arena for exercising the
insights  of  superstring  theory.  we  will  discuss  these  nascent  insights  shortly,  but  first,  we  briefly
recount the pre–string theory cosmological story, which is often referred to as the standard model of
cosmology.

the standard model of cosmology

the modern theory of cosmic origins dates from the decade and a half after einstein's completion of
general relativity. although einstein refused to take his own theory at face value and accept that it
implies that the universe is neither eternal nor static, a

it strains one's ability to find a fitting metaphor or an enlightening analogy: the density of the universe
at  the  planck  time  was  simply colossal.  at  such  energies  and  densities  gravity  and  quantum
mechanics can no longer be treated as two separate entities as they are in point-particle quantum field
theory. instead, the central message of this book is that at and beyond these enormous energies we
must  invoke  string  theory.  in  temporal  terms,  we  encounter  these  energies  and  densities  when  we
probe  earlier  than  the  planck  time  of  10-43  seconds  atb,  and  hence  this  earliest  epoch  is  the
cosmological arena of string theory.

let's head toward this era by first seeing what the standard cosmological theory tells us about

the universe before a hundredth of a second atb, but after the planck time.

physicists believe that between the planck time and a hundredth of a second atb, the universe
behaved  in  a  very  similar  way,  passing  through  at  least  two  analogous  phase  transitions.  at
temperatures above 1028 kelvin, the three nongravitational forces appeared as one, as symmetric as
they could possibly be. (at the end of this chapter we will discuss string theory's inclusion of the
gravitational  force  into  this  high-temperature  merger.)  but  as  the  temperature  dropped  below  1028
kelvin, the universe underwent a phase transition in which the three forces crystallized out from their
common union in different ways. their relative strengths and the details of how they act on matter
began to diverge. and so, the symmetry among the forces evident at higher temperatures was broken
as the universe cooled. nevertheless, the work of glashow, sal

to the current theory, in figure 14.1.

cosmology and superstring theory

there remains a sliver of figure 14.1, between the big bang and the planck time, that we have not yet
discussed. by blindly applying the equations of general relativity to that region, physicists have found
that the universe continues to get ever smaller, ever hotter, and ever denser, as we move backward in
time toward the bang. at time zero, as the size of the universe vanishes, the temperature and density
soar to infinity, giving us the most extreme signal that this theoretical model

of the universe, firmly
rooted in the classical gravitational framework of general relativity, has completely broken down.

nature is telling us emphatically that under such conditions we must merge general relativity and
quantum mechanics—in other words, we must make use of string theory. currently, research on the
implications of string theory for cosmology is at an early stage of development. perturbative methods
can,  at  best,  give  skeletal  insights,  since  the  extremes  of  energy,  temperature,  and  density  require
precision  analysis. although  the  second  superstring  revolution  has  provided  some  nonperturbative
techniques,  it  will  be  some  time  before  they  are  honed  for  the  kinds  of  calculations  required  in  a
cosmological setting. nevertheless, as we now discuss, during the last decade or so

, physicists have
taken the first steps toward understanding string cosmology. here is what they have found.

it  appears  that  there  are  three  essential  ways  in  which  string  theory  modifies  the  standard
cosmological model. first, in a manner that current research continues to clarify, string theory implies
that the universe has what amounts to a smallest possible size. this has profound consequences for
our understanding of the universe at the moment of the bang itself, when the standard theory claims
that  its  size  has  shrunk  all  the  way  to  zero.  second,  string  theory  has  a  small-radius/large-radius
duality (intimately related to its having a smallest possible size), which also has deep cosmological
significance,  as  we  will  see  in  a  moment.  finally,  string  
 
 ___________________________
 
theory  has  more  than  four  spacetime
dimensions,  and  from  a  cosmological  standpoint,  we  must  address  the  evolution  of  them  all.  let's
discuss these points in greater detail.

in the beginning there was a planck-sized nugget

in the late 1980s, robert brandenberger and cumrun vafa made the first important strides toward
understanding how the application of these string theoretic features modifies the conclusions of the
standard  cosmological  framework.  they  came  to  two  important  realizations.  first,  as  we  run  the
clock backward in time toward the beginning, the temperature continues to rise until the size of the

begins to decrease. the intuitive reason behind this is not hard to come by. imagine for simplicity (as
brandenberger and vafa did) that a

ll of the space dimensions of the universe are circular. as we run
the clock backward and the radius of each of these circles shrinks, the temperature of the universe
increases. but as each of the radii collapses toward and then through the planck length, we know that,
within string theory, this is physically identical to the radii shrinking to the planck length and then
bouncing  back  toward  increasing  size.  since  temperature  goes  down  as  the  universe  expands,  we
would  expect  that  the  futile  attempt  to  squeeze  the  universe  to  sub-planck  size  means  that  the
temperature stops rising, hits a maximum, and then begins to decrease. through detailed calculations,
brandenberger and vafa explicitly verified that indeed this is the case.

this led branden

berger and vafa to the following cosmological picture. in the beginning, all of
the spatial dimensions of string theory are tightly curled up to their smallest possible extent, which is
roughly the planck length. the temperature and energy are high, but not infinite, since string theory has
avoided  the  conundrums  of  an  infinitely  compressed  zero-size  starting  point.  at  this  beginning
moment of the universe, all the spatial dimensions of string theory are on completely equal footing—
they  are  completely  symmetric—all  curled  up  into  a  multidimensional,  planck-sized  nugget.  then,
according to brandenberger and vafa, the universe goes through its first stage of symmetry reduction
when, at about the planck time, three of the spatial dimensions are singled out for expansion, while all
others  retain  their  initial  planck-scale  size.  these  three  space  dimensions  are  then  identified  with
those in the inflationary co

why three?

an immediate question is, what drives the symmetry reduction that singles out precisely three spatial
dimensions  for  expansion?  that  is,  beyond  the  experimental  fact  that  only  three  of  the  space
dimensions have expanded to observably large size, does string theory provide a fundamental reason
for why some other number (four, five, six, and so on) or, even more symmetrically, all of the space
dimensions  don't  expand  as  well?  brandenberger  and  vafa  came  up  with  a  possible  explanation.
remember that the small-radius/large-radius duality of string theory rests upon the fact that when a
dimension is curled up like a circle, a string can wrap around it. brandenberger and vafa realized
that,  like  rubber  bands  wrapped  around  a  bicycle

 tire  inner  tube,  such  wrapped  strings  tend  to
constrict the dimensions they encircle, keeping them from expanding. at first sight, this would seem to
mean that each of the dimensions will be constricted, since the strings can and do wrap them all. the
loophole  is  that  if  a  wrapped  string  and  its  antistring  partner  (roughly,  a  string  that  wraps  the
dimension in the opposite direction) should come into contact, they will swiftly annihilate one other,
producing  an unwrapped  string.  if  these  processes  happen  with  sufficient  rapidity  and  efficiency,
enough of the rubber band–like constriction will be eliminated, allowing the dimensions to expand.
brandenberger and vafa suggested that this reduction in the choking effect of wrapped strings will
happen in only three of the spatial dimensions. here's why.

imensional  plane  such  as  the  spatial  extent  of  flatland,  it  is  likely  that  they  will  never
collide. the second spatial dimension opens up a new world of trajectories for each particle, most of
which do not cross each other at the same point at the same time. in three, four, or any higher number
of dimensions, it gets increasingly unlikely that the two particles will ever meet. brandenberger and
vafa realized that an analogous idea holds if we replace point particles with loops of string, wrapped
around  spatial  dimensions.  although  it's  significantly  harder  to  see,  if  there  are three  (or  fewer)
circular spatial dimensions, two wrapped strings will likely collide with one another—the analog of
what  happens  for  two  particles  moving  in  one  dimension.  but  in  four  or  more  space  dimensions,
wrapped  strings  are  less  and  less  likely  ever  to  collide—the  analog  of  what  happens  for  point
particles in two or more dimensions.4

this leads to th

e following picture. in the first moment of the universe, the tumult from the high,
but finite, temperature drives all of the circular dimensions to try to expand. as they do, the wrapped
strings constrict the expansion, driving the dimensions back to their original planck-size radii. but,
sooner or later a random thermal fluctuation will drive three dimensions momentarily to grow larger
than the others, and our discussion then shows that strings which wrap these dimensions are highly
likely  to  collide.  about  half  of  the  collisions  will  involve  string/antistring  pairs,  leading  to
annihilations that continually lessen the constriction, allowing these three dimensions to continue to
expand. the more they expand, the less likely it is for other strings to get entangled around them since
it takes more energy for a string to wrap around a larger dimension. thus, the expansion feeds on
itself, becoming ever less constricted as t

atures  we  observe  in  the  world
around us. the challenge facing physicists is to understand, in detail, the evolution of the calabi-yau

component of space so that its present form can be predicted from theoretical principles. with the
newfound  ability  of  one  calabi-yau  to  change  smoothly  into  another,  we  see  that  the  issue  of
selecting one calabi-yau shape from the many may in fact be reduced to a problem of cosmology.5

before the beginning?

lacking the exact equations of string theory, brandenberger and vafa were forced to make numerous
approximations and assumptions in their cosmological studies. as vafa recently said,

our  work  highlights  the  new  way  in  which  string  theory  allows  us  to  start  addressing
persistent problems in the standard approach to cosmology. we see, for example, that the
whole  notion  of  an  initial  singularity  may  be  completely  avoided  by  string  theory.  but,

situations with our present understanding of string theory, our work only provides a first
look into string cosmology, and is very far from the final word.6

since  their  work,  physicists  have  made  steady  progress  in  furthering  the  understanding  of  string
cosmology,  spearheaded  by,  among  others,  gabriele  veneziano  and  his  collaborator  maurizio
gasperini  of  the  university  of  torino.  gasperini  and  veneziano  have  come  up  with  their  own
intriguing version of string cosmology that shares certain features with the scenario described above,
but also differs in significant ways. as in the brandenberger and vafa work, they too rely on string
theory's  having  a  minimal  length  in  order  to  avoid  the  infinite  temperature  an

calling time zero—that leads up to the planckian cosmic embryo.

in this so-called pre–big bang scenario, the universe began in a vastly different state than it does
in  the  big  bang  framework.  gasperini  and  veneziano's  work  suggests  that  rather  than  being
enormously  hot  and  tightly  curled  into  a  tiny  spatial  speck,  the  universe  started  out  as  cold  and
essentially infinite in spatial extent. the equations of string theory then indicate that—somewhat as in
guth's inflationary epoch—an instability kicked in, driving every point in the universe to rush rapidly
away from every other. gasperini and veneziano show that this caused space to become increasingly
curved  and  results  in  a  dramatic  increase  in  temperature  and  energy  density.7 after  some  time,  a
millimeter-sized three-dimensional region within this vast expanse could look just like the super-hot
and dense patch emerging from guth's in

flationary expansion. then, through the standard expansion of
ordinary big bang cosmology, this patch can account for the whole of the universe with which we are
familiar. moreover, because the pre–big bang epoch involves its own inflationary expansion, guth's
solution to the horizon problem is automatically built into the pre–big bang cosmological scenario. as
veneziano has said, "string theory offers us a version of inflationary cosmology on a silver platter."8
the study of superstring cosmology is rapidly becoming an active and fertile arena of research.
the pre–big bang scenario, for example, has already generated a significant amount of heated, yet
fruitful debate, and it is far from clear what role it will have in the cosmological framework that will
ultimately  emerge  from  string  theory.  achieving  these  cosmological  insights  will,  no  doubt,  rely
heavily  on  the  ability  of  physicists  to  come  to  grips  with  all  aspects  of  the  second  superstring

higher-dimensional branes? how do the cosmological properties we have discussed change if string
theory happens to have a coupling constant whose value places us more toward the center of figure
12.11 rather than in one of the peninsular regions? that is, what is the impact of full-fledged m-theory
on the earliest moments of the universe? these central questions are now being studied vigorously.

hen the temperature of the universe is high enough. how does the strength of the gravitational force
fit into this picture? before the emergence of m-theory, string theorists were able to show that with
the simplest of choices for the calabi-yau component of space, the gravitational force almost, but not
quite, merges with the other three, as shown in figure 14.2. string theorists found that the mismatch
could be avoided by carefully molding the shape of the chosen calabi-yau, among other tricks of the
trade,  but  such  after-the-fact  fine  tuning  always  makes  a  physicist  uncomfortable.  since  no  one
currently knows how to predict the precise form of the calabi-yau dimensions, it seems dangerous to
rely upon solutions to problems that hinge so delicately on the fine details of their shape.

figure 14.2 within m-theory, the strengths of all four forces

can naturally merge.

witten has shown, however, that the second superstring revolution provides a far more robust
solution. by investigating how the strengths of the forces vary when the string coupling constant is not
necessarily small, witten found that the gravitational force curve can be gently nudged to merge with
the other forces, as in figure 14.2, without any special molding of the calabi-yau portion of space.
although it is far too early to tell, this may indicate that cosmological unity is more easily achieved
by making use of the larger framework of m-theory.

the  developments  discussed  in  this  and  the  previous  sections  represent  the  first,  somewhat

teps  toward  understanding  the  cosmological  implications  of  string/m-theory.  during  the
coming years, as the nonperturbative tools of string/m-theory are sharpened, physicists anticipate that
some of the most profound insights will emerge from their application to cosmological questions.

but  without  currently  having  methods  that  are  sufficiently  powerful  to  understand  cosmology
according  to  string  theory  fully,  it  is  worthwhile  to  think  about  some  general  considerations
concerning the possible role of cosmology in the search for the ultimate theory. we caution that some
of these ideas are of a more speculative nature than much of what we have discussed previously, but
they do raise issues that any purported final theory may one day have to address.

cosmological speculation and the ultimate theory

cosmology has the ability to grab hold of us at a deep, visceral level because

but it is possible that even more basic features of the universe, perhaps even the properties of the
fundamental  matter  and  force  particles,  also  have  a  direct  dependence  on  historical  evolution—
evolution that itself is contingent upon the initial conditions of the universe.

in fact, we've already noted one possible incarnation of this idea in string theory: as the hot,
early universe evolved, the extra dimensions may have transmuted from shape to shape, ultimately
settling down to one particular calabi-yau space once things had cooled off sufficiently. but, like a
ball tossed in the air, the result of that journey through numerous calabi-yau shapes may well depend
on details of how the journey got started in the first place. and through the influence of the resulting
calabi-yau shape on particle masses and on properties of forces, we see t

profound impact on the physics we currently
observe.

we don't know what the initial conditions of the universe were, or even the ideas, concepts, and
language that should be used to describe them. we believe that the outrageous initial state of infinite
energy, density, and temperature that arises in the standard and inflationary cosmological models is a
signal  that  these  theories  have  broken  down  rather  than  a  correct  description  of  the  physical
conditions that actually existed. string theory offers an improvement by showing how such infinite

but even beyond the issue of initial conditions and their impact on the ensuing historical twists
and turns of cosmic evolution, some recent and highly speculative proposals have argued for yet other
potential limits on the explanatory power of any final theory. no one knows if these ideas are right or
wrong, and certainly they currently lie on the outskirts of mainstream science. but they do highlight—

  ask  or  whether—like
asking general relativity to give insight into how hard you happened to toss a ball in the air—it is a
question  that  lies  forever  beyond  the  grasp  of  any  theory.  valiant  attempts  by  physicists  such  as
hawking and james hartle of the university of california at santa barbara have tried to bring the
question  of  cosmological  initial  conditions  within  the  umbrella  of  physical  theory,  but  all  such
attempts remain inconclusive. in the context of string/m-theory, our cosmological understanding is, at
present, just too primitive to determine whether our candidate "theory of everything" truly lives up to
its name and determines its own cosmological initial conditions, thereby elevating them to the status
of physical law. this is a prime question for future research.

the central observation is that whereas in chapter 7 we noted that everything we know points
toward  a  consistent  and  uniform  physics  throughout  our  universe,  this  may  hav

measure,  with  all  the  profound  implications  that  this  has  on  stars  and  on  life  as  we  know  it  (as
indicated in chapter 1). and in other universes, physics may differ in still more dramatic ways: the
list of elementary particles and forces may be completely distinct from ours, or, taking a cue from
string  theory,  even  the  number  of  extended  dimensions  may  differ,  with  some  cramped  universes
having as few as zero or one large spatial dimension, while other expansive universes possess eight,
nine,  or  even  ten  extended  spatial  dimensions.  if  we  let  our  imaginations  run  free,  even  the  laws
themselves can drastically differ from universe to universe. the range of possibilities is endless.

here's the point. if we scan through this huge maze of universes, the vast majorit

to the one we inhabit. and moreover, we can imagine that this wealth of universes may be physically
realized, leading to a multiverse—something that, at first sight, forever limits our predictive power.
in fact, however, this discussion illustrates that an ultimate explanation can yet be achieved, so long
as we grasp not only the ultimate laws but also their implications for cosmological evolution on an
unexpectedly grand scale.

undoubtedly, the cosmological implications of string/m-theory will be a major field of study
well into the twenty-first century. without accelerators capable of producing planck-scale energies,
we will increasingly have to rely on the cosmological accelerator of the big bang, and the relics it has
left for us throughout the universe, for our experimental data. with luck and perseverance, we may
finally be able to answer questions such as how the universe began, and why it has evolved to the
form we behold in the heavens and on earth. there is, of

 course, much uncharted territory between
where we are and where full answers to these fundamental questions lie. but the development of a
quantum theory of gravity through superstring theory lends credence to the hope that we now possess
theoretical tools for pushing into the vast regions of the unknown, and, no doubt after many a struggle,
possibly emerging with answers to some of the deepest questions ever posed.

we continue to seek the ultimate theory, we may well find that string theory is but one of many pivotal
steps on a path toward a far grander conception of the cosmos—a conception that involves ideas that
differ radically from anything we have previously encountered. the history of science teaches us that
each time we think that we have it all figured out, nature has a radical surprise in store for us that
requires significant and sometimes drastic changes in how we think the world works. then again, in a

although we are still feeling the aftershocks of the second superstring revolution and absorbing
the panoply of new insights that it has engendered, most string theorists agree that it will likely take a
third and maybe a fourth such theoretical upheaval before the full power of string theory is unleashed
and its possible role as the final theory assessed. as we have seen, string theory has already painted a
remarkable new picture of how the universe works, but there are significant hurdles and loose ends
that will no doubt be the primary focus of string theorists in the twenty-first century. and so, in this
last chapter we will not be able to finish telling the story of humanity's search for the deepest laws of
the universe, because the search continues. instead, let's guide our gaze into the future of string theory
by  discussing  five  central  questions  string  the
 
 ___________________________
 
orists  will  face  as  they  continue  the  pursuit  of  the
ultimate theory.

what is the fundamental principle underlying string theory?

one  overarching  lesson  we  have  learned  during  the  past  hundred  years  is  that  the  known  laws  of
physics  are  associated  with  principles  of  symmetry.  special  relativity  is  based  on  the  symmetry
embodied in the principle of relativity—the symmetry between all constant-velocity vantage points.
the gravitational force, as embodied in the general theory of relativity, is based on the equivalence

principle—the  extension  of  the  principle  of  relativity  t
 
 ___________________________
 
ted  differently  from  another's?  it  seems  far  more
natural  for  the  laws  of  the  universe  to  treat  all  observational  vantage  points  equally;  this  is
accomplished through the equivalence principle and the introduction of gravity into the structure of
the cosmos. although it requires some mathematical background to appreciate fully, as we indicated
in  chapter  5,  there  is  a  similar  rationale  behind  the  gauge  symmetries  underlying  the  three
nongravitational forces.

string theory takes us down another notch on the scale of explanatory depth because all of these
symmetry  principles,  as  well  as  another—supersymmetry—emerge  from  its  structure.  in  fact,  had
history followed a different course—and had physicists come upon string theory some hundred years
earlier—we can imagine that these symmetry principles would have all been discovered by studying
its properties. but bear in mind that whereas the equivalence principle gives us some understanding
o
 
 ___________________________
 
f why gravity exists, and the gauge symmetries give us some sense of why the nongravitational forces
exist, in the context of string theory these symmetries are consequences; although their importance is
in no way diminished, they are part of the end product of a much larger theoretical structure.

this  discussion  brings  the  following  question  into  sharp  relief:  is  string  theory  itself  an
inevitable  consequence  of  some  broader  principle—possibly  but  not  necessarily  a  symmetry
principle—in much the same way that the equivalence principle inexorably leads to general relativity
or that gauge symmetries lead to the nongravitational forces? as of this writing, no one has any insight
into the answer to this question. to appreciate its importance, we need only imagine einstein trying to
formulate general relativity without having had the happy thought 
 
 ___________________________
 
o
formulate  general  relativity  without  first  having  this  key  insight,  but  it  certainly  would  have  been
extremely  difficult.  the  equivalence  principle  provides  a  succinct,  systematic,  and  powerful
organizational framework for analyzing the gravitational force. the description of general relativity
we gave in chapter 3, for example, relied centrally on the equivalence principle, and its role in the
full mathematical formalism of the theory is even more crucial.

currently, string theorists are in a position analogous to an einstein bereft of the equivalence
principle. since veneziano's insightful guess in 1968, the theory has been pieced together, discovery
by  discovery,  revolution  by  revolution.  but  a  central  organizing  principle  that  embraces  these
discoveries and all other features of the theory within one overarching and systematic framework—a
framework  that  makes  the  existence  of  each  individual  ingredient  absolutely  inevitable—is  still
m
 
 ___________________________
 
issing. the discovery of this principle would mark a pivotal moment in the development of string
theory,  as  it  would  likely  expose  the  theory's  inner  workings  with  unforeseen  clarity.  there  is,  of
course, no guarantee that such a fundamental principle exists, but the evolution of physics during the
last hundred years encourages string theorists to have high hopes that it does. as we look to the next

stage in the development of string theory, finding its "principle of inevitability"—that underlying idea
from which the whole theory necessarily springs forth—is of the highest priority.2

what are space and time, really, and can we do without them?

in  many  of  the  preceding  chapters,  we  have  freely  made  use  of  the  concepts  of  space  and  of
spacetime.  in  chapter  2  we  described  einstein's  realization  that  space  and  time  are  inextricably
interwoven  by  the  unexpected  fact  that  an  object's  mo
 
 ___________________________
 
hrough  space  has  an  influence  on  its
passage  through  time.  in  chapter  3,  we  deepened  our  understanding  of  spacetime's  role  in  the
unfolding  of  the  cosmos  through  general  relativity,  which  shows  that  the  detailed  shape  of  the
spacetime fabric communicates the force of gravity from one place to another. the violent quantum
undulations in the microscopic structure of the fabric, as discussed in chapters 4 and 5, established
the need for a new theory, leading us to string theory. and finally, in a number of the chapters that
followed, we have seen that string theory proclaims that the universe has many more dimensions than
we  are  aware  of,  some  of  which  are  curled  up  into  tiny  but  complicated  shapes  that  can  undergo
wondrous transformations in which their fabric punctures, tears, and then repairs itself.

through graphic representations such as figures 3.4, 3.6, and 8.10, we have tried to illustrate
these ideas by envisioning the fabric of space

rimentally successful three laws of motion, held sway for more than two hundred years, leibniz's
conception,  further  developed  by  the austrian  physicist  ernst  mach,  is  much  closer  to  our  current
picture. as we have seen, einstein's special and general theories of relativity firmly did away with
the concept of an absolute and universal notion of space and time. but we can still ask whether the
geometrical model of spacetime that plays such a pivotal role in general relativity and in string theory
is solely a convenient shorthand for the spatial and temporal relations between various locations, or
whether  we  should  view  ourselves  as  truly  being  embedded  in something  when  we  refer  to  our
immersion within the spacetime fabric.

although we are heading into speculative territory, string theory does suggest an answer to this
question. the graviton, the smallest bundle of gravitational force, is one particular pattern of string
vibration. and  just  as  an  electromagneti

c  field  such  as  visible  light  is  composed  of  an  enormous
number of photons, a gravitational field is composed of an enormous number of gravitons—that is, an

enormous number of strings executing the graviton vibrational pattern. gravitational fields, in turn,
are encoded in the warping of the spacetime fabric, and hence we are led to identify the fabric of
spacetime itself with a colossal number of strings all undergoing the same, orderly, graviton pattern
of vibration. in the language of the field, such an enormous, organized array of similarly vibrating
strings is known as a coherent state of strings. it's a rather poetic image—the strings of string theory
as the threads of the spacetime fabric—but we should note that its rigorous meaning has yet to be
worked out completely.

nevertheless,  describing  the  spacetime  fabric  in  this  string-stitched  form  does  lead  us  to
contemplate 
 
 ___________________________
 
the following question. an ordinary piece of fabric is the end product of someone having
carefully woven together individual threads, the raw material of common textiles. similarly, we can
ask  ourselves  whether  there  is  a  raw  precursor  to  the  fabric  of  spacetime—a  configuration  of  the
strings  of  the  cosmic  fabric  in  which  they  have  not  yet  coalesced  into  the  organized  form  that  we
recognize as spacetime. notice that it is somewhat inaccurate to picture this state as a jumbled mass
of  individual  vibrating  strings  that  have  yet  to  stitch  themselves  together  into  an  ordered  whole
because, in our usual way of thinking, this presupposes a notion of both space and time—the space in
which a string vibrates and the progression of time that allows us to foll

ow its changes in shape from
one moment to the next. but in the raw state, before the strings that make up the cosmic fabric engage
in the orderly, coherent vibrational dance we are discussing, there is no realization of space or time.
even our language is too coarse to handle these ideas, for, in fact, there is even no notion of before. in
a sense, it's as if individual strings are "shards" of space and time, and only when they appropriately
undergo sympathetic vibrations do the conventional notions of space and time emerge.

imagining such a structureless, primal state of existence, one in which there is no notion of space
or  time  as  we  know  it,  pushes  most  people's  powers  of  comprehension  to  their  limit  (it  certainly
pushes mine). like the stephen wright one-liner about the photographer who is obsessed with getting
a close-up shot of the horizon, we
 
 ___________________________
 
 run up against a clash of paradigms when we try to envision a
universe that is, but that somehow does not invoke the concepts of space or time. nevertheless, it is
likely that we will need to come to terms with such ideas and understand their implementation before
we  can  fully  assess  string  theory.  the  reason  is  that  our  present  formulation  of  string  theory
presupposes the existence of space and time within which strings (and the other ingredients found in
m-theory) move about and vibrate. this allows us to deduce the physical properties of string theory
in a universe with one time dimension, a certain number of extended space dimensions (usually taken
to  be  three),  and  additional  dimensions  that  are  curled  up  into  one  of  the  shapes  allowed  by  the
equations of the theory. but this is somewhat like assessing an artist's creative talent by requiring that
she work from a paint-by-number kit. she

will, undoubtedly, add a personal flair here or there, but by
so tightly constraining the format of her work, we are blinding ourselves to all but a slender view of
her  abilities.  similarly,  since  the  triumph  of  string  theory  is  its  natural  incorporation  of  quantum
mechanics and gravity, and since gravity is bound up with the form of space and time, we should not
constrain the theory by forcing it to operate within an already existing spacetime framework. rather,
just as we should allow our artist to work from a blank canvas, we should allow string theory to
create its own spacetime arena by starting in a spaceless and timeless configuration.

the hope is that from this blank slate starting point—pos

sibly in an era that existed before the
big  bang  or  the  pre–big  bang  (if  we  can  use  temporal  terms,  for  lack  of  any  other  linguistic
framework)—the theory will describe a universe that evolves to a form in which a background of
coherent  string  vibrations  emerges,  yielding  the  conventional  notions  of  space  and  time.  such  a
framework, if realized, would show that space, time, and, by association, dimension are not essential

atavistic, and primary state.

an object that behaves somewhat like a point particle at large distances but has drastically different
properties at short ones—may give us a glimpse of the spaceless and timeless realm. their work has
revealed  that  whereas  strings  show  us  that  conventional  notions  of  space  cease  to  have  relevance
below the planck scale, the zero-branes give essentially the same conclusion but also provide a tiny
window  on  the  new  unconventional  framework  that  takes  over.  studies  with  these  zero-branes
indicate  that  ordinary  geometry  is  replaced  by  something  known  as noncommutative  geometry,  an

dscape.  nevertheless,  as  we  focus  our  attention  on
scales larger than the planck length, physicists have shown that our conventional notion of space does
re-emerge. it is likely that the framework of noncommutative geometry is still some significant steps
away  from  the  blank-slate  state  anticipated  above,  but  it  does  give  us  a  hint  of  what  the  more
complete framework for incorporating space and time may involve.

finding the correct mathematical apparatus for formulating string theory without recourse to a
pre-existing notion of space and time is one of the most important issues facing string theorists. an
understanding  of  how  space  and  time  emerge  would  take  us  a  huge  step  closer  to  answering  the
crucial question of which geometrical form actually does emerge.

will string theory lead to a reformulation of quantum mechanics?

the universe is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics to fantastic accuracy. even so, in

concepts such as a particle having a definite position and a definite velocity at any given moment in
time. it is only after detailed microscopic scrutiny that we realize that we must modify such familiar
classical ideas. our process of discovery has gone from a classical framework to one that is modified
by quantum revelations, and this progression is echoed in the way that physicists, to this day, go about
constructing their theories.

this  is  certainly  the  case  with  string  theory.  the  mathematical  formalism  describing  string
theory begins with equations that describe the motion of a tiny, infinitely thin piece of classical thread
—equations that, to a large extent, newton could have written down some three hundred years ago.
these equations are then quantized. that is, in a systematic manner developed by physicists over the
course  of  more  than  50  years,  the  classical  equations  are  converted  into  a  quantum-mechanical
framework in which probabi

fact,  in  chapter  12  we  have  seen  this  procedure  in  action:  the  loop  processes  (see  figure  12.6)
incorporate quantum concepts—in this case, the momentary quantum-mechanical creation of virtual
string  pairs—with  the  number  of  loops  determining  the  precision  with  which  quantum-mechanical
effects are accounted for.

the strategy of beginning with a theoretical description that is classical and then subsequently
including the features of quantum mechanics has been extremely fruitful for many years. it underlies,
for example, the standard model of particle physics. but it is possible, and there is growing evidence
that it is likely, that this method is too conservative for dealing w

ith theories that are as far-reaching
as string theory and m-theory. the reason is that once we realize that the universe is governed by
quantum-mechanical principles, our theories really should be quantum mechanical from the start. we
have successfully gotten away with starting from a classical perspective until now because we have
not been probing the universe at a deep enough level for this coarse approach to mislead us. but with
the  depth  of  string/m-theory,  we  may  well  have  come  to  the  end  of  the  line  for  this  battle-tested
strategy.

we can find specific evidence for this by reconsidering some of the insights emerging from the
second superstring revolution (as summarized, for example, by figure 12.11). as we discussed in
chapter  12,  the  dualities  underlying  the  unity  of  the  five  string  theories  show  us  that  physical
processes that occur in any one string formulation can be reinterpreted in the dual language

of any of
the others. this rephrasing will at first appear to have little to do with the original description, but, in
fact,  this  is  simply  the  power  of  duality  at  work:  through  duality,  one  physical  process  can  be
described in a number of vastly different ways. these results are both subtle and remarkable, but we
have not yet mentioned what may well be their most important feature.

that 

the duality translations often take a process, described in one of the five string theories, that is
strongly dependent on quantum mechanics (for example, a process involving string interactions that
would  not  happen  if  the  world  were  governed  by  classical,  as  opposed  to  quantum,  physics)  and
reformulate it as a process that is weakly dependent on quantum mechanics from the perspective of
one  of  the  other  string  theories  (for  example,  a  process  whose  detailed  numerical  properties  are
influenced by quantum considerations but whose qualitative form

is similar to what it would be in a
purely  classical  world).  this  means  that  quantum  mechanics  is  thoroughly  intertwined  within  the

currently, no one knows how to do this. but many string theorists foresee a reformulation of how
quantum principles are incorporated into our theoretical description of the universe as the next major
upheaval in our understanding. for example, as cumrun vafa has said, "i think that a reformulation of
quantum mechanics which will resolve many of its puzzles is just around the corner. i think many
share the view that the recently uncovered dualities point toward a new, more geometrical framework
for  quantum  mechanics,  in  which  space,  time,  and

nd according to edward witten, "i believe the logical status of quantum mechanics is
going to change in a manner that is similar to the way that the logical status of gravity changed when

einstein  discovered  the  equivalence  principle.  this  process  is  far  from  complete  with  quantum
mechanics, but i think that people will one day look back on our epoch as the period when it began."6
with guarded optimism, we can envision that a reframing of the principles of quantum mechanics
within string theory may yield a more powerful formalism that is capable of giving us an answer to
the question of how the universe began and why there are such things as space and time—a formalism
that will take us one step closer to answering leibniz's question of why there is something rather than
nothing.

can string theory be experimentally tested?

among  the  many  features  of  string  theory  that  we  have  discussed  in  the  preceding  chapters,  the
following three are perhaps the most importa
 
 ___________________________
 
nt ones to keep firmly in mind. first, gravity and quantum
mechanics are part and parcel of how the universe works and therefore any purported unified theory
must incorporate both. string theory accomplishes this. second, studies by physicists over the past
century  have  revealed  that  there  are  other  key  ideas—many  of  which  have  been  experimentally
confirmed—that appear central to our understanding of the universe. these include the concepts of
spin, the family structure of matter particles, messenger particles, gauge symmetry, the equivalence
principle,  symmetry  breaking,  and  supersymmetry,  to  name  a  few.  all  of  these  concepts  emerge
naturally  from

  string  theory.  third,  unlike  more  conventional  theories  such  as  the  standard  model,
which  has  19  free  parameters  that  can  be  adjusted  to  ensure  agreement  with  experimental
measurements,  string  theory  has  no  adjustable  parameters.  in  principle,  its  implications  should  be
thoroughly  definitive—they  should  provide  an  unambiguous  test  of  whether  the  theory  is  right  or
wrong.

the road from this "in principle" ratiocination to an "in practice" fact is encumbered by many
hurdles. in chapter 9 we described some of the technical obstacles, such as determining the form of
the extra dimensions, that currently stand in our way. in chapters 12 and 13 we placed these and
 
 ___________________________
 
 other
obstacles in the broader context of our need for an exact understanding of string theory, which, as we
have  seen,  naturally  leads  us  to  the  consideration  of  m-theory.  no  doubt,  achieving  a  full
understanding  of  string/m-theory  will  require  a  great  deal  of  hard  work  and  an  equal  amount  of
ingenuity.

at every step of the way, string theorists have sought and will continue to seek experimentally
observable  consequences  of  the  theory.  we  must  not  lose  sight  of  the  long-shot  possibilities  for
finding evidence of string theory discussed in chapter 9. furthermore, as our understanding deepens
there will, no doubt, be other rare processes or features of string theory that will suggest yet other
indirect experimental signatures.

but  most  notably,  the  confirmation  of  supersymmetry,  through  the  discovery  of
 
 ___________________________
 
  superpartner
particles  as  discussed  in  chapter  9,  would  be  a  major  milestone  for  string  theory.  we  recall  that
supersymmetry was discovered in the course of theoretical investigations of string theory, and that it
is  a  central  part  of  the  theory.  its  experimental  confirmation  would  be  a  compelling,  albeit
circumstantial,  piece  of  evidence  for  strings.  moreover,  finding  the  superpartner  particles  would
provide a welcome challenge, since the discovery of supersymmetry would do far more than merely
answer the yes-no question of its relevance to our world. the masses and charges of the superpartner
particles  would  reveal  the  detailed  way  in  which  supersymmetry  is  incorporated  into  the  laws  of
nature. string theorists would then face the challenge of seeing whether this implementation can be

fully realized or explained by 
 
 ___________________________
 
string theory. of course, we can be even more optimistic and hope that
within  the  next  decade—before  the  large  hadron  collider  in  geneva  comes  on-line—the
understanding  of  string  theory  will  have  progressed  sufficiently  for  detailed  predictions  about  the
superpartners to be made prior to their hoped-for discovery. confirmation of such predictions would
be a monumental moment in the history of science.

are there limits to explanation?

explaining everything, even in the circumscribed sense of understanding all aspects of the forces and
the elementary constituents of the universe, is one of the greatest challenges science has ever faced.
and for the first time,

 superstring theory gives us a framework that appears to have sufficient depth to
meet  the  challenge.  but  will  we  ever  realize  the  promise  of  the  theory  fully  and,  for  example,
calculate the masses of the quarks or the strength of the electromagnetic force, numbers whose precise
values dictate so much about the universe? as in the previous sections, we will have to surmount
numerous theoretical hurdles on the way to these goals—currently, the most prominent is achieving a

but is it possible that even if we had an exact understanding of string/-m-theory, framed within a
new and far more transparent formulation of quantum mechanics, we could still fail in our quest to
calculate  particle  masses  and  force  strength?  is  it  possible  that  we  would  still  have  to  resort  to
experimental  measurements,  rather  than  theoretical  calculations,  for  their  values? and,  moreover,
might it be that this failing does not mean that we need to look for an even deeper theory, but simply
reflects that there is no explanation for these

e  that  may  never  be  resolved.  we  have  seen,  for  instance,  that  even  the
speculative  notion  of  the  multiverse,  which  at  first  sight  appears  to  present  a  definite  limit  to
scientific explanation, can be dealt with by dreaming up equally speculative theories that, at least in
principle, can restore predictive power.

one highlight emerging from these considerations is the role of cosmology in determining the
implications of an ultimate theory. as we have discussed, superstring cosmology is a young field,
even by the youthful standards set by string theory itself. it will, undoubtedly, be an area of primary
research focus for years to come, and it is likely to be one of the major growth areas of the field. as
we  continue  to  gain  new  insight  into  the  properties  of  string/m-theory,  our  ability  to  assess  the

cosmological  implications  of  this  rich  attempt  at  a  unified  theory  will  become  ever  sharper.  it  is
possible,  of  course,  that  such

 turn out to be so thoroughly parochial—that there was a
whole  new  mind-boggling  world  lying  just  beneath  the  surface  of  things  as  they  are  ordinarily

but even these paradigm-shaking discoveries are only part of a larger, all-encompassing story.
with  solid  faith  that  laws  of  the  large  and  the  small  should  fit  together  into  a  coherent  whole,
physicists are relentlessly hunting down the elusive unified theory. the search is not over, but through
superstring  theory  and  its  evolution  into  m-theory,  a  cogent  framework  for  merging  quantum
mechanics, general relativity, and the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces has finally emerged.
and  the  challenges  these  developments  pose  to  our  previous  way  of  seeing  the  world  are
monumental: loops of strings and oscillating globules, uniting all of creation into vibrational patterns
that are meticulously executed in a universe with numerous hidden dimensions capable of undergoing
ex

treme contortions in which their spatial fabric tears apart and then repairs itself. who could have
guessed that the merging of gravity and quantum mechanics into a unified theory of all matter and all
forces would yield such a revolution in our understanding of how the universe works?

no  doubt,  there  are  even  grander  surprises  in  store  for  us  as  we  continue  to  seek  a  full  and
calculationally tractable understanding of superstring theory. already, through studies in m-theory,
we have seen glimpses of a strange new domain of the universe lurking beneath the planck length,
possibly one in which there is no notion of time or space. at the opposite extreme, we have also seen
that our universe may merely be one of the innumerable frothing bubbles on the surface of a vast and
turbulent cosmic ocean called the multiverse. these ideas are at the current edge of speculation, but
they may presage the next leap in our understanding

but once again, if it is found and its properties measured, these will be input data for the standard
model, for which the theory offers no explanation.

7.  for  the  mathematically  inclined  reader,  we  note  that  the  association  between  string
vibrational patterns and force charges can be described more precisely as follows. when the motion
of a string is quantized, its possible vibrational states are represented by vectors in a hilbert space,
much as for any quantum-mechanical system. these vectors can be labeled by their eigenvalues under
a  set  of  commuting  hermitian  operators.  among  these  operators  are  the  hamiltonian,  whose
eigenvalues  give  the  energy  and  hence  the  mass  of  the  vibrational  state,  as  well

12),  witten  and,  most  notably,  joe  lykken  of  the  fermi  national  accelerator  laboratory  have
identified a subtle, yet possible, loophole in this conclusion. lykken, exploiting this realization, has
suggested  that  it  might  be  possible  for  strings  to  be  under  far  less  tension,  and  therefore  be
substantially larger in size, than originally thought. so large, in fact, that they might be observable by

is the exciting prospect that many of the remarkable implications of string theory discussed in this and
the following chapters will be verifiable experimentally within the next decade. but even in the more

"conventional" scenario espoused by string theorists, in which strings are typically on the order of 10-
33 centimeters in length, there are indirect ways to search for them experimentally, as we will discuss
in chapter 9.

and a positron is a virtual photon and therefore must shortly relinquish its energy by dissociating into
a particle-antiparticle pair.

recording them on

a piece of photographic film. our use of a camera in this example is symbolic,
since we are not imagining bouncing photons off of the colliding strings. rather, we simply want to
record in figure 6.7(c) the whole history of the interaction. having said that, we should point out one
further subtle point that the discussion in the text glosses over. we learned in chapter 4 that we can
formulate  quantum  mechanics  using  feynman's  sum-over-paths  method,  in  which  we  analyze  the
motion  of  objects  by  combining  contributions  from all  possible  trajectories  that  lead  from  some
chosen starting point to some chosen destination (with

weight  determined  by  feynman).  in  figures  6.6  and  6.7  we  show one  of  the  infinite  number  of
possible trajectories followed by point particles (figure 6.6) or by strings (figure 6.7) taking them
from their initial positions to their final destinations. the discussion in this section, however, applies
equally  well  to  any  of  the  other  possible  trajectories  and  therefore  applies  to  the  whole  quantum-
mechanical process itself. (feynman's formulation of point-particle quantum mechanics in the sum-

note  that  if  the  extra  curled-up  dimension  has  an  impact  predominantly  on  the  gravitational  force
(something, it turns out, that is quite plausible in string theory), all extant experiments could well have
overlooked it. new, highly sensitive gravitational experiments will look for such "large" curled-up
dimensions in the near future. a positive result would be one of the greatest discoveries of all time.

wu established that the universe is not perfectly left-right symmetric—in the language of the field, the
universe  is chiral.  it  is  this  feature  of  the  standard  model  (the  weak  force,  in  particular)  that
physicists found nearly impossible to incorporate into a higher-dimensional supergravity framework.
to avoid confusion, we note that in chapter 10 we will discuss a concept in string theory known as
"mirror symmetry," but the use of the word "mirror" in that context is completely different from its use
here.

book applies equally well to open strings (a string with loose ends) or closed-string loops (the strings
on which we have focused), the topic discussed here is one in which the two kinds of strings would
appear to have different properties. after all, an open string will not get entangled by looping around
a  circular  dimension.  nevertheless,  through  work  that  ultimately  has  played  a  pivotal  part  in  the

3.  mathematically,  the  identity  between  the  string  energies  in  a  universe  with  a  circular
dimension whose radius is either r or 1/r arises from the fact that the energies are of the form v/r +

wr, where v is the vibration number and w is the winding number. this equation is invariant under the
simultaneous  interchange  of v  and w  as  well  as r and 1/r—i.e., under the interchange of vibration
and winding numbers and inversion of the radius. in our discussion we are working in planck units,
but we can work in more conventional unit

4. you  may  be  wondering  how  it's  possible  for  a  string  that  stretches  all  the  way  around  a
circular dimension of radius r to nevertheless measure the radius to be 1/r. although a thoroughly
justifiable concern, its resolution actually lies in the imprecise phrasing of the question itself. you
see, when we say that the string is wrapped around a circle of radius r, we are by necessity invoking
a definition of distance (so that the phrase "radius r" has meaning). but this definition of distance is
the one relevant for the unwound string modes
 
 ___________________________
 
that is, the vibration modes. from the point of view
of this definition of distance—and only this definition—the winding string configurations appear to
stretch around the circular part of space. however, from the second definition of distance, the one that
caters to the wound-string configurations, they are every bit as localized in space as are the vibration
modes  from  the  viewpoint  of  the  first  definition  of  distance,  and  the  radius  they  "see"  is  1/r,  as
discussed in the text. this description gives some sense of why wound and unwound strings measure
distances that are inversely related. but as the point is quite subtle, it is perhaps worth noting the
underlying  technical  analysis  for  the  mathematically  inclined  reader.  in  ordinary  point-partic

that is, a position eigenstate |x> on a circle of radius r can be defined by |x>= veixp|p>  where p =
v/r and |p> is a momentum eigenstate (the direct analog of what we have called a uniform-vibration
mode of a string—overall motion without change in shape). in string theory, though, there is a second

more explicitly, we can now imagine taking the two wavepackets |x> and | >, both starting say, at the

ational  approach  for  defining
distance. the radius of the circle, as measured by either probe, is then proportional to the required
time lapse for the packet to return to its initial configuration. since a state with energy e evolves with
a phase factor involving et, we see that the time lapse, and hence the radius, is t ~ 1/e ~ r for the
vibration modes and t ~ 1/e ~1/r for the winding modes.

5. for the mathematically inclined reader, we note that, more precisely, the number of families
of string vibrations is one-half the absolute value of the euler characteristic of the calabi-yau space,
as mentioned in note 16 of chapter 9. this is given by the absolute value of difference  between h2,1
and h1,1, where hp,q denotes the (p,q) hodge number. up to a numerical shift, these count the number
of nontrivial homology three-cycles  ("three-dimensional  holes")  and  the  number  of  homology  two-
cycles ("two-dimensional holes"). and so, whereas we speak of the total number of holes in the ma

2. let's briefly summarize the differences between the five string theories. to do so, we note that
vibrational disturbances along a loop of string can travel clockwise or counterclockwise. the type
iia  and  type  iib  strings  differ  in  that  in  the  latter  theory,  these  clockwise/counterclockwise
vibrations  are  identical,  while  in  the  former,  they  are  exactly  opposite  in  form. opposite  has  a
precise mathematical meaning in this context, but it's easiest to think about in terms of the spins of the
resulting vibrational patterns in each th

eory. in the type iib theory, it turns out that all particles spin
in the same direction (they have the same chirality), whereas in the type iia theory, they spin in both
directions  (they  have  both  chiralities).  nevertheless,  each  theory  incorporates  supersymmetry.  the
two  heterotic  theories  differ  in  a  similar  but  more  dramatic  way.  each  of  their  clockwise  string
vibrations looks like those of the type ii string (when focusing on just the clockwise vibrations, the
type iia and type iib theories are the same), but their counterclockwise vibrations are those of the
original bosonic string theory. although the bosonic string has insurmountable problems when chosen
for  both  clockwise  and  counterclockwise  string  vibrations,  in  1985  david  gross,  jeffrey  harvey,
emil martinec, and ryan rhom (all then at princeton university and dubbed the "princeton string
quartet") showed that a perfectly sensibl
 
 ___________________________
 
e theory emerges if it is used in combination with the type ii
string.  the  really  odd  feature  of  this  union  is  that  it  has  been  known  since  the  work  of  claude
lovelace of rutgers university in 1971 and the work of richard brower of boston university, peter
goddard of cambridge university, and charles thorn of the university of florida at gainesville in
1972  that  the  bosonic  string  requires  a  26-dimensional  spacetime,  whereas  the  superstring,  as  we
have  discussed,  requires  a  10-dimensional  one.  so  the  heterotic  string  constructions  are  a  strange
hybrid—a heterosis—in  which  counterclockwise  vibrational  patterns  live  in  26  dimensions  and
clockwise patterns live in 10 dimensions! before you get caught up in trying to make sense of this
perplexing union, gross and his collaborators showed that the extra 16 dimensions on the bosonic
side must be curled up into one of two very special higher-dimensional doughn

utlike shapes, giving

rise to the heterotic-o and heterotic-e theories. since the extra 16 dimensions on the bosonic side
are rigidly curled up, each of these theories behaves as though it really has 10 dimensions, just as in
the type ii case. again, both heterotic theories incorporate a version of supersymmetry. finally, the
type i theory is a close cousin of the type iib string except that, in addition to the closed loops of
string we have discussed in previous chapters, it also has strings with unconnected ends—so-called
open strings.

3. when we speak of "exact" answers in this chapter, such as the "exact" motion of the earth,
what  we  really  mean  is  the  exact  prediction  for  some  physical  quantity within  some  chosen
theoretical framework. until we truly have the final theory—perhaps we now do, perhaps we never
will—all of our theories will themselves be approximations to reality. but this notion of approximate
has nothing to do with our discussion in this chap
 
 ___________________________
 
ter. here we are concerned with the fact that within
a chosen theory, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to extract the exact predictions that the theory
makes.  instead,  we  have  to  extract  such  predictions  using  approximation  methods  based  on  a
perturbative approach.

4. these diagrams are string theory versions of the so-called feynman diagrams, invented by

richard feynman for performing perturbative calculations in point-particle quantum field theory.

5. more precisely, every virtual string pair, that is, every loop in a given diagram, contributes—
among other more complicated terms—a multiplicative factor of the string coupling constant. more
loops translate into more factors of the string coupling constant. if the string coupling constant is less
than  1,  repeated  multiplica
 
 ___________________________
 
s  1  or  larger,
repeated multiplications yield a contribution with the same or larger magnitude.

6. for the mathematically inclined reader, we note that the equation states that spacetime must
admit  a  ricci-flat  metric.  if  we  split  spacetime  into  a  cartesian  product  of  four-dimensional
minkowski spacetime and a six-dimensional compact kähler space, ricci-flatness is equivalent to
the latter being a calabi-yau manifold. this is why calabi-yau spaces play such a prominent role in
string theory.

7.  of  course,  nothing  absolutely  ensures  that  these  indirect  approaches  are  justified.  for
example,  just  as  some  faces  are  not  left-right  symmetric,  it might  be  that  the  laws  of  physics  are
different in other far-flung regions of the universe, as we will discuss briefly in chapter 14.

8. the expert reader will recognize that these statements require so-called n=2 supersymmetry.
9. to be a little more precise, if we call the heterotic-o coupling constant gho
 
 ___________________________
 
 and the type i
coupling  constant gi,  then  the  relation  between  the  two  theories  states  that  they  are  physically
identical so long as gho = 1/gi, which is equivalent to gi = 1/gho. when one coupling constant is big
the other is small.

10. this is a close analog of the r, 1/r duality discussed previously. if we call the type iib
string coupling constant giib then the statement that appears to be true is that the values giib and 1/giib
describe the same physics. if giib is big, 1/giib is small, and vice versa.

11. if all but four dimensions are curled up, a theory with more than eleven total dimensions
necessarily gives rise to massless particles with spin greater than 2, something that both theoretical
and experimental considerations rule out.

12. a  notable  exception  is  the  important  1987  work  of  duff,  paul  howe,
 
 ___________________________
 
  takeo  inami,  and
kelley stelle in which they drew on earlier insights of eric bergshoeff, ergin sezgin, and townsend
to argue that ten-dimensional string theory should have a deep eleven-dimensional connection.

13. more precisely, this diagram should be interpreted as saying that we have a single theory

that  depends  on  a  number  of  parameters.  the  parameters  include  coupling  constants  as  well  as
geometrical size and shape parameters. in principle, we should be able to use the theory to calculate
particular  values  for  all  of  these  parameters—a  particular  value  for  its  coupling  constant  and  a
particular form for the
 
 ___________________________
 
 spacetime geometry—but within our current theoretical understanding, we do
not know how to accomplish this. and so, to understand the theory better string theorists study its
properties as the values of these parameters are varied over all possibilities. if the parameter values
are chosen to lie in any of the six peninsular regions of figure 12.11, the theory has the properties
inherent to one of the five string theories, or to eleven-dimensional supergravity, as marked. if the
parameter  values  are  chosen  to  lie  in  the  central  region,  the  physics  is  governed  by  the  still
mysterious m-theory.

14. we should note, though, that even in the peninsular regions there are some exotic ways in
which branes can have an effect on familiar physics. for example, it has been suggested that our three
extended spatial dimensions might themselves be a three-brane that is large and unfurled. if so, as we

dimension  of  lineland  is  also  two,  and  hence  their  paths  will  generally  intersect  (assuming  their

four. this means that strings moving in four spacetime dimensions (three space and one time) will

us from one calabi-yau to any other, allowing the multiverse to sample the reproductive efficiency of
all  universes  based  on  strings. after  the  multiverse  has  passed  through  sufficiently  many  stages  of
reproduction,  smolin's  hypothesis  would  lead  us  to  expect  that  the  typical  universe  will  have  a
