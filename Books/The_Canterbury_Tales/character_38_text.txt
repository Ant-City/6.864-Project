bestowed on the book, and the broad consideration of its fitness
for the object contemplated.

 from books the editor has derived valuable help; as from mr
cowden clarke's revised modern text of the canterbury tales,
published in mr nimmo's library edition of the english poets;
from mr wright's scholarly edition of the same work; from the
indispensable tyrwhitt; from mr bell's edition of chaucer's
poem; from professor craik's "spenser and his poetry,"
published twenty-five years ago by charles knight; and from
many others. in the abridgement of the faerie queen,  the plan
may at first sight seem to be modelled on the lines of mr craik's
painstaking condensation; but the coincidences are either
inevitable or involuntary.  many of the notes, especially of those
explaining classical references and those attached to the minor
poems of chaucer, have been prepared specially for this edition.
the editor leaves his task with the hope that his attempt to
remove artificial obstacles to the popularity

f cambridge clerk;" while he had  already
told us that when he was stirred to seek the court of cupid he
was "at eighteen year of age." according to leland, however,
he was educated at oxford, proceeding thence to france and
the netherlands, to finish his studies; but there remains no
certain evidence of his having belonged to either university. at
the same time, it is not doubted that his family was of good
condition; and, whether or not we accept the assertion that his
father held the rank of knighthood -- rejecting the hypotheses
that make him a merchant, or a vintner "at the corner of kirton
lane" -- it is plain, from chaucer's whole career, that he had
introductions to public life, and recommendations to courtly
favour, wholly independent of his genius. we have the clearest
testimony that his mental training was of wide range and
thorough excellence, altogether rare for a mere courtier in those
days: his poems attest his intimate acquaintance with the
divinity, the philosophy, and the s

e assigned to a later period of chaucer's
life; but very little is positively known about the dates and
sequence of his various works. in the year 1386, being called as
witness with regard to a contest on a point of heraldry between
lord scrope and sir robert grosvenor, chaucer deposed that
he entered on his military career in 1359. in that year edward
iii invaded france, for the third time, in pursuit of his claim to
the french crown; and we may fancy that, in describing the
embarkation of the knights in "chaucer's dream", the poet
gained some of the vividness and stir of his picture from his
recollections of the embarkation of the splendid and well-
appointed royal host at sandwich, on board the eleven hundred
transports provided for the enterprise. in this expedition the
laurels of poitiers were flung on the ground; after vainly
attempting rheims and paris, edward was constrained, by cruel
weather and lack of provisions, to retreat toward his ships; the
fury of the elements made the retre

et's daughter was not celebrated later than
1366; the probability is, that it closely followed his return from
the wars. in 1367, edward iii. settled upon chaucer a life-
pension of twenty marks, "for the good service which our
beloved valet -- 'dilectus valettus noster' -- geoffrey chaucer
has rendered, and will render in time to come." camden
explains 'valettus hospitii' to signify a gentleman of the privy
chamber; selden says that the designation was bestowed "upon
young heirs designed to he knighted, or young gentlemen of
great descent and quality." whatever the strict meaning of the
word, it is plain that the poet's position was honourable and
near to the king's person, and also that his worldly
circumstances were easy, if not affluent -- for it need not be said
that twenty marks in those days represented twelve or twenty
times the sum in these.  it is believed that he found powerful
patronage, not merely from the duke of lancaster and his wife,
but from margaret countess of pembroke, t

that close attention to business
which probably curtailed the poetic fruits of the poet's most
powerful years. <8>

chaucer is next found occupying a post which has not often
been held by men gifted with his peculiar genius -- that of a
county member. the contest between the dukes of gloucester
and lancaster, and their adherents, for the control of the
government, was coming to a crisis; and when the recluse and
studious chaucer was induced to offer himself to the electors of
kent as one of the knights of their shire -- where presumably he
held property -- we may suppose that it was with the view of
supporting his patron's cause in the impending conflict. the
parliament in which the poet sat assembled at westminster on
the 1st of october, and was dissolved on the 1st of november,
1386. lancaster was fighting and intriguing abroad, absorbed in
the affairs of his castilian succession; gloucester and his friends
at home had everything their own way; the earl of suffolk was
dismissed from the wo

y stage of the connecting story we
bless the happy thought which gives us incessant incident,
movement, variety, and unclouded but never monotonous
joyousness.

the poet, the evening before he starts on a pilgrimage to the
shrine of st thomas at canterbury, lies at the tabard inn, in
southwark, curious to know in what companionship he is
destined to fare forward on the morrow. chance sends him
"nine and twenty in a company," representing all orders of
english society, lay and clerical, from the knight and the abbot
down to the ploughman and the sompnour. the jolly host of
the tabard, after supper, when tongues are loosened and hearts
are opened, declares that "not this year" has he seen such a
company at once under his roof-tree, and proposes that, when
they set out next morning, he should ride with them and make
them sport. all agree, and harry bailly unfolds his scheme: each
pilgrim, including the poet, shall tell two tales on the road to
canterbury, and two on the way back to london; and

he whom
the general voice pronounces to have told the best tale, shall be
treated to a supper at the common cost -- and, of course, to
mine host's profit -- when the cavalcade returns from the saint's
shrine to the southwark hostelry. all joyously assent; and early
on the morrow, in the gay spring sunshine, they ride forth,
listening to the heroic tale of the brave and gentle knight, who
has been gracefully chosen by the host to lead the spirited
competition of story-telling.

to describe thus the nature of the plan, and to say that when
chaucer conceived, or at least began to execute it, he was
between sixty and seventy years of age, is to proclaim that the
canterbury tales could never be more than a fragment. thirty
pilgrims, each telling two tales on the way out, and two more
on the way back -- that makes 120 tales; to say nothing of the
prologue, the description of the

notes to life of geoffrey chaucer


1. "edmund spenser, a native of london, was born with a muse
of such power, that he was superior to all english poets of
preceding ages, not excepting his fellow-citizen chaucer."

2. see introduction to "the legend of good women".

3. called in the editions before 1597 "the dream of chaucer".
the poem, which is not included in the present edition, does
indeed, like many of chaucer's smaller works, tell the story of a
dream, in which a knight, representing john of gaunt, is found
by the poet mourning the loss of his lady; but the true "dream
of chaucer," in which he celebrates the marriage of his patron,
was published for the first time by speght in 1597. john of
gaunt, in the end of 1371, married his second wife, constance,
daughter to pedro the cruel of spain; so that "the book of the
duchess" must have been written between 1369 and 1371.

notes to the knight's tale.


1. for the plan and principal incidents of the "knight's tale,"
chaucer was indebted to boccaccio, who had himself borrowed
from some prior poet, chronicler, or romancer.  boccaccio
speaks of the story as "very ancient;" and, though that may not
be proof of its antiquity, it certainly shows that he took it from
an earlier writer. the "tale" is more or less a paraphrase of
boccaccio's "theseida;" but in some points the copy has a
distinct dramatic superiority over the original.  the "theseida"
contained ten thousand lines; chaucer has condensed it i

than one-fourth of the number. the "knight's tale" is supposed
to have been at first composed as a separate work; it is
undetermined whether chaucer took it direct from the italian of
boccaccio, or from a french translation.

2. highte: was called; from the anglo-saxon "hatan", to bid or
call; german, "heissen", "heisst".

3. feminie: the "royaume des femmes" -- kingdom of the
amazons. gower, in the "confessio amantis," styles
penthesilea the "queen of feminie."

anglo-saxon, "lice," a corpse; german, "leichnam."

terras ac pelagus regens,
et coelo imperitans, amor."

and the imperial heavens)

1. small tithers:  people who did not pay their full tithes.  mr
wright remarks that "the sermons of the friars in the fourteenth
century were most frequently designed to impress the ahsolute
duty of paying full tithes and offerings".

2. there might astert them no pecunial pain: they got off with
no mere pecuniary punishment. (transcriber's note: "

astert"
means "escape".  an alternative reading of this line is "there
might astert him no pecunial pain" i.e. no fine ever escaped him
(the archdeacon))

3. a dog for the bow:  a dog attending a huntsman with bow
and arrow.

4. ribibe: the name of a musical instrument; applied to an old
woman because of the shrillness of her voice.

5. de par dieux: by the gods.

6. see note 12 to the knight's tale.

7. wariangles: butcher-birds; which are very noisy and
ravenous, and tear in pieces the birds on which they prey; the
thorn on which they do this was said to become poisonous.

8. medieval legends located hell in the north.

9. the pythoness: the witch, or woman, possesed with a

whilom there was dwelling in lombardy
a worthy knight, that born was at pavie,
in which he liv'd in great prosperity;
and forty years a wifeless man was he,
and follow'd aye his bodily delight
on women, where as was his appetite,
as do these fooles that be seculeres.<2>

 lord to grante him, that he
mighte once knowen of that blissful life
that is betwixt a husband and his wife,
and for to live under that holy bond
with which god firste man and woman bond.
"none other life," said he, "is worth a bean;
for wedlock is so easy, and so clean,
that in this world it is a paradise."
thus said this olde knight, that was so wise.
and certainly, as sooth* as god is king,                           *true
to take a wife it is a glorious thing,
and namely* when a man is old and hoar,                      *especially

much authority need be given to a difference that may be due to
mere omission of the mark of contraction over the "a," there is
enough in the text to show that another person than the king's
younger son is intended.  the squire promises to tell the
adventures that befell each member of cambuscan's family; and
in thorough consistency with this plan, and with the canons of

removal of its scene to a southern clime.

the story of alexander is so commune,
that ev'ry wight that hath discretion
hath heard somewhat or all of his fortune.
this wide world, as in conclusion,
he won by strength; or, for his high renown,
they were glad for peace to him to send.
the pride and boast of man he laid adown,
whereso he came, unto the worlde's end.

comparison yet never might be maked
between him and another conqueror;
for all this world for dread of him had quaked
he was of knighthood and of freedom flow'r:
fortune him made the heir of her honour.
save wine and women, nothing might assuage
his high intent in arms and labour,
so was he full of leonine courage.

what praise were it to him, though i you told
of darius, and a hundred thousand mo',
of kinges, princes, dukes, and earles bold,
which he conquer'd, and brought them into woe?

notes to the cuckoo and the nightingale


1. these two lines occur also in the knight's tale; they
commence the speech of theseus on the love follies of palamon
and arcite, whom the duke has just found fighting in the forest.

2. a stronger reading is "all."

3. "ocy, ocy," is supposed to come from the latin "occidere,"
to kill; or rather the old french, "occire," "occis," denoting the
doom which the nightingale imprecates or supplicates on all
who do offence to love.

4. grede: cry; italian, "grido."

5."but if he be away therewith, y-wis,
he may full soon of age have his hair"

who prays that she may have a year's respite. nature grants the
prayer, pronounces judgment accordingly, and dismisses the
assembly; and after a chosen choir has sung a roundel in honour
of the goddess, all the birds fly away, and the poet awakes. it is
probable that chaucer derived the idea of the poem from a
french source; mr bell gives the outline of a fabliau, of which
three versions existed, and in which a contention between two
ladies regarding the merits of their respective lovers, a knight
and a clerk, is decided by cupid in a court composed of birds,
which assume their sides according to their different natures.
whatever the source of the idea, its management, and the whole
workmanship of the poem, especially in the more humorous
passages, are essentially chaucer's own.]

the laurel divine: so called, either because it was apollo's
tree -- horace says that pindar is "laurea donandus apollinari" ("to
be given apollo's laurel") -- or because the honour which it
signified, when placed on the head of a poet or conqueror, lifted
a man as it were into the rank of the gods.

12. if chaucer had any special trio of courtiers in his mind when
he excluded so many names, we may suppose them to be
charms, sorcery, and leasings who, in the knight's tale, come
after bawdry and riches -- to whom messagerie (the carrying
of messages) and meed (reward, bribe) may correspond.

surprises her; and she sees "a world of ladies" emerge from a
grove, clad in white, and wearing garlands of laurel, of agnus
castus, and woodbind. one, who wears a crown and bears a
branch of agnus castus in her hand, begins a roundel, in honour
of the leaf, which all the others take up, dancing and singing in
the meadow before the arbour. soon, to the sound of
thundering trumps, and attended by a splendid and warlike
retinue, enter nine knights, in white, crowned like the ladies;
and after they have jousted an hour and more, they alight and
advance to the ladies. each dame takes a knight by the hand;
and all incline reverently to the laurel tree, which they
encompass, singing of love, and dancing. soon, preceded by a
band of minstrels, out of the open field comes a lusty company
of knights and ladies in green, crowned with chaplets of
flowers; and they do reverence to a tuft of flowers in the middle

of shade. then a strong wind beats down all the flowers, save
such as are protected by the leaves of hedges and groves; and a
mighty storm of rain and hail drenches the ladies and knights,
shelterless in the now flowerless meadow. the storm overpast,
the company in white, whom the laurel-tree has safely shielded
from heat and storm, advance to the relief of the others; and
when their clothes have been dried, and their wounds from sun
and storm healed, all go together to sup with the queen in

nightingale perches, while the goldfinch flies to the lady of the

that she has the love of such a knight. after dinner they speak
of cressida's business; all confirm deiphobus' assurances of
protection and aid; and pandarus suggests that, since troilus is
there, cressida shall herself tell him her case. helen and
deiphobus alone accompany pandarus to troilus' chamber;
there troilus produces some documents relating to the public

not have doubted her truth, yet sought to remove his jealousy,
and offered to submit to any ordeal or oath he might impose;
then, weeping, she covered her face, and lay silent. "but now,"
exclaims the poet --

in the morning, diomede was ready to escort cressida to the

difficulty resist an impulse to slay him -- but restrained himself,
lest his lady should be also slain in the tumult. when cressida
was ready to go,

11. the third of may seems either to have possessed peculiar
favour or significance with chaucer personally, or to have had a
special importance in connection with those may observances
of which the poet so often speaks. it is on the third night of
may that palamon, in the knight's tale, breaks out of prison,
and at early morn encounters in the forest arcita, who has gone
forth to pluck a garland in honour of may; it is on the third
night of may that the poet hears the debate of "the cuckoo and
the nightingale"; and again in the present passage the favoured
date recurs.

15. the fair gem virtueless:  possessing none of the virtues
which in the middle ages were universally believed to be

16. the crop and root: the most perfect example. see note 29

anglo-saxon, "eame;" german, "oheim."

36. the idea of this stanza is the same with that developed in
the speech of theseus at the close of the knight's tale; and it is
probably derived from the lines of boethius, quoted in note 91
to that tale.

84. it will be remembered that, at the beginning of the first
book, cressida is introduced to us as a widow.

85. diomede is called "sudden," for the unexpectedness of his
assault on cressida's heart -- or, perhaps, for the abrupt
abandonment of his indifference to love.

86. penscel:  a pennon or pendant; french, "penoncel." it  was
the custom in chivalric times for a knight to wear, on days of
tournament or in battle, some such token of his lady's favour, or
badge of his service to her.

87. she has been told that troilus is deceiving her.

of breaking the law was enhanced by the temporary absence of
their queen from the realm. just at this moment the cry was
raised that the queen came; all the ladies hastened to meet her;
and soon the poet saw her approach -- but in her company his
mistress, wearing the same garb, and a seemly knight. all the

into mine hand there put anon,
which brought again my mind and breath,
and me recover'd from the death.
wherefore to her so am i hold,*                       *beholden, obliged
that for her all things do i wo'ld,
for she was leach* of all my smart,                           *physician
and from great pain so quit* my heart.                        *delivered
and as god wot, right as ye hear,
me to comfort with friendly cheer,
she did her prowess and her might.
and truly eke so did this knight,
in that he could; and often said,
that of my woe he was *ill paid,*              *distressed, ill-pleased*
and curs'd the ship that him there brought,
the mast, the master that it wrought.
and, as each thing must have an end,
my sister here, our bother friend, <4>
gan with her words so womanly
this knight entreat, and cunningly,
for mine honour and hers also,
and said that with her we should go
both in her ship, where she was brought,
which was so wonderfully wrought,
so clean, so rich, and so

 and paid;*                          *satisfied
and me to comfort and to please,
and my heart for to put at ease,
she took great pain in little while,
and thus hath brought us to this isle
as ye may see; wherefore each one
i pray you thank her one and one,
as heartily as ye can devise,
or imagine in any wise."

at once there then men mighte see'n,
a world of ladies fall on kneen
before my lady, --

thanking her, and placing themselves at her commandment.
then the queen sent the aged lady to the knight, to learn of him
why he had done her all this woe; and when the messenger had
discharged her mission, telling the knight that in the general
opinion he had done amiss, he fell down suddenly as if dead for
sorrow and repentance. only with great difficulty, by the queen
herself, was he restored to consciousness and comfort; but
though she spoke kind and hope-inspiring words, her heart was
not in her speech,

for her intent was, to his barge
him for to bring against the eve,
with certain ladies, a

to *suffer her* thenceforth in peace,                    *let her dwell*
as other princes had before;
and from thenceforth, for evermore,
she would him worship in all wise
that gentlenesse might devise;
and *pain her* wholly to fulfil,               *make her utmost efforts*
in honour, his pleasure and will.

and during thus this knighte's woe, --
present* the queen and other mo',                *(there being) present*
my lady and many another wight, --
ten thousand shippes at a sight
i saw come o'er the wavy flood,
with sail and oar; that, as i stood
them to behold, i gan marvail
from whom might come so many a sail;
for, since the time that i was born,
such a navy therebeforn
had i not seen, nor so array'd,
that for the sight my hearte play'd
ay to and fro within my breast;
for joy long was ere it would rest.

sat and sang, with voice full out,
ballads and lays right joyously,
as they could in their harmony.

the ladies were alarmed and sorrow-stricken at sight of the
ships, thinking that the knight's companions were on board; and
they went towards the walls of the isle, to shut the gates. but it
was cupid who came; and he had already landed, and marched
straight to the place where the knight lay. then he chid the
queen for her unkindness to his servant; shot an arrow into her
heart; and passed through the crowd, until he found the poet's
lady, whom he saluted and complimented, urging her to have
pity on him that loved her. while the poet, standing apart, was
revolving all this in his mind

d smiled, and
said that he would be king within that island, his new conquest;
then, after long conference with the queen, he called a council
for the morrow, of all who chose to wear his colours. in the
morning, such was the press of ladies, that scarcely could
standing-room be found in all the plain. cupid presided; and one
of his counsellors addressed the mighty crowd, promising that
ere his departure his lord should bring to an agreement all the
parties there present. then cupid gave to the knight and the
dreamer each his lady; promised his favour to all the others in
that place who would truly and busily serve in love; and at
evening took his departure. next morning, having declined the
proffered sovereignty of the island, the poet's mistress also
embarked, leaving him behind; but he dashed through the
waves, was drawn on board her ship from peril of death, and
graciously received into his lady's lasting favour. here the poet
awakes, finding his cheeks and body all wet with tears; and,

removing into another chamber, to rest more in peace, he falls
asleep anew, and continues the dream. again he is within the
island, where the knight and all the ladies are assembled on a
green, and it is resolved by the assembly, not only that the
knight shall be their king, but that every lady there shall be
wedded also. it is determined that the knight shall depart that
very day, and return, within ten days, with such a host of
benedicts, that none in the isle need lack husbands. the knight

to their name, caused by the lightness of their trust in
strangers, the queen and all the ladies of the isle had vowed
neither to eat, nor drink, nor sleep, nor speak, nor cease
weeping till all were dead. the queen had died the first; and half
of the other ladies had already "under the earth ta'en lodging
new." the woeful recorder of all these woes invites the prince
to behold the queen's hearse:

"come within, come see her hearse
where ye shall see the piteous sight
that ever yet was shown to knight;
for ye shall see ladies stand,
each with a greate rod in hand,
clad in black, with visage white,
ready each other for to smite,
if any be that will not weep;
or who makes countenance to sleep.
they be so beat, that all so blue
they be as cloth that dy'd is new."

scarcely has the lady ceased to speak, when the prince plucks
forth a dagger, plunges it into his heart, and, drawing but one
breath, expires.

on the morrow a general assembly was convoked, and it was
resolved that the wedding feast should be celebrated within the
island. messengers were sent to strange realms, to invite kings,
queens, duchesses, and princesses; and a special embassy was
despatched, in the magic barge, to seek the po

who was brought back after fourteen days, to the great joy of
the queen. next day took place the wedding of the prince and
all the knights to the queen and all the ladies; and a three
months' feast followed, on a large plain "under a wood, in a
champaign, betwixt a river and a well, where never had abbey
nor cell been, nor church, house, nor village, in time of any
manne's age." on the day after the general wedding, all
entreated the poet's lady to consent to crown his love with
marriage; she yielded; the bridal was splendidly celebrated; and

cer's description of the wondrous horse, in the squire's

7. salad: a small helmet; french, "salade."

8. gardebrace: french, "garde-bras," an arm-shield; probably
resembling the "gay bracer" which the yeoman, in the prologue
to the canterbury tales, wears on his arm.

9. confession and prayer were the usual preliminaries of any
enterprise in those superstitious days; and in these days of
enlightenment the fashion yet lingers among the most
superstitious class -- the fisher-folk.

10. the knights resolved that they would quit their castles and
houses of stone for humble huts.

11. the knight and lady were buried without music, although
the office for the dead was generally sung.

12. avisand: considering; present participle from "avise" or
"advise."

13. treacle; corrupted from latin, "therisca," an antidote. the
word is used for medicine in general.

14. the abbess made diligence: i.e. to administer the grain to
the dead ladies.



the prologue to the legend of good women.

e "the legend of good
women." those who would fix that date at a
period not long before the poet's death -- who
would place the poem, indeed, among his closing
labours -- support their opinion by the fact that the
prologue recites most of chaucer's principal
works, and glances, besides, at a long array of
other productions, too many to be fully catalogued.
but, on the other hand, it is objected that the
"legend" makes no mention of "the canterbury
tales" as such; while two of those tales -- the
knight's and the second nun's -- are enumerated
by the titles which they bore as separate
compositions, before they were incorporated in the
great collection: "the love of palamon and
arcite," and "the life of saint cecile" (see note 1
to the second nun's tale). tyrwhitt seems perfectly
justified in placing the composition of the poem
immediately before that of chaucer's magnum
opus, and after the marriage of richard ii to his
first queen, anne of bohemia. that event took
place in 1382; and since it i

post through all the changes among the courtiers. the passage
cited from dante will be found in the "inferno," canto xiii. 64 --
69.

23. chaucer says that the usurping lords who seized on the
government of the free lombard cities, had no regard for any
rule of government save sheer tyranny  -- but a natural lord, and
no usurper, ought not to be a tyrant.

24. farmer: one who merely farms power or revenue for his
own purposes and his own gain.

25. this was the first version of the knight's tale. see the
introductory note, above

26. boece: boethius' "de consolatione philosophiae;" to which
frequent reference is made in the canterbury tales. see, for
instances, note 91 to the knight's tale; and note 34 to the
squire's tale.

27. a poem entitled "the lamentation of mary magdalene,"
said to have been "taken out of st origen," is included in the
editions of chaucer; but its authenticity, and consequently its
identity with the poem here mentioned, are doubted.

a paraphrase of the well-known proverb, "bis dat qui cito dat."
("he gives twice who gives promptly")

30. the same prohibition occurs in the fifteenth statute of "the
court of love."

31. chaucer is always careful to allege his abstinence from the
pursuits of gallantry; he does so prominently in "the court of
love," "the assembly of fowls," and "the house of fame."

32. pity runneth soon in gentle heart: the same is said of
theseus, in the knight's tale, and of canace, by the falcon, in
the squire's tale.

33. stellify: assign to a place among the stars; as jupiter did to
andromeda and cassiopeia.

34. agathon: there was an athenian dramatist of this name,
who might have made the virtues and fortunes of alcestis his
theme; but the reference is too vague for the author to be
identified with any confidence.
