Somerset - 
      Somerset is an English lord who argues with Richard Plantagenet, later known as York. Their disagreement dates from a scene in the Temple Garden when they both pick roses to signify their opposite sides in a legal argument. Somerset chooses the red rose, Plantagenet the white. Later, in France, Somerset's dislike for York endangers the English campaign when he delays sending cavalry to York. Without these reinforcements York is unable to back Talbot in battle, and Talbot dies.
