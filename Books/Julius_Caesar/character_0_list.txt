[CHARACTER] - 
                a
supporter of the republic who believes strongly in a government
guided by the votes of senators. while [CHARACTER] loves caesar as a
friend, he opposes the ascension of any single man to the position
of dictator, and he fears that caesar aspires to such power. [CHARACTER]'s inflexible
sense of honor makes it easy for caesar's enemies to manipulate
him into believing that caesar must die in order to preserve the
republic. while the other conspirators act out of envy and rivalry,
only [CHARACTER] truly believes that caesar's death will benefit rome.
unlike caesar, [CHARACTER] is able to separate completely his public
life from his private life; by giving priority to matters of state,
he epitomizes roman virtue. torn between his loyalty to caesar and
his allegiance to the state, [CHARACTER] becomes the tragic hero of the
play.
