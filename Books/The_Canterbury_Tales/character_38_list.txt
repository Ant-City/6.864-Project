The Knight - 
                    Arthur's
young knight rapes a maiden, and, to avoid the punishment of death,
he is sent by the queen on a quest to learn about submission to
women. Once he does so, and shows that he has learned his lesson
by letting his old ugly wife make a decision, she rewards him by
becoming beautiful and submissive.
