[CHARACTER]

[CHARACTER]'s challenge to beowulf's honor differentiates
him from beowulf and helps to reveal some of the subtleties of the
heroic code that the warriors must follow. [CHARACTER] is presented
as a lesser man, a foil for the near-perfect beowulf. (a foil is
a character whose traits contrast with and thereby accentuate those
of another character.) the bitterness of [CHARACTER]'s chiding of beowulf
about his swimming match with breca clearly reflects his jealousy
of the attention that beowulf receives. it probably also stems from
his shame at being unable to protect heorot himself--he is clearly
not the sort of great warrior whom legend will remember. while boasting
is a proper and acceptable form of self-assertion, [CHARACTER]'s harsh
words show that it ought not to be bitter or disparaging of others.
rather than heroism, [CHARACTER]'s blustering reveals pride and resentment.
later, [CHARACTER]'s gift of his sword for beowulf's fight against grendel's mother
heals [CHARACTER]'s breach of hospitality, but it does little to improve
his heroic status. unlike beowulf, [CHARACTER] is clearly afraid to
fight the monster himself.
