conclusion of einstein's work is that no object—in fact, no influence or disturbance of any sort—can
travel faster than the speed of light. but, as we shall discuss in chapter 3, newton's experimentally
successful  and  intuitively  pleasing  universal  theory  of  gravitation  involves  influences  that  are
transmitted over vast distances of space instantaneously. it was einstein, again, who stepped in and
resolved  the  conflict  by  offering  a  new  conception  of  gravity  with  his  1915  general  theory  of
relativity. just as special relativity overturned previous conceptions of space and time, so too did
general relativity. not only are space and time influenced by one's state of motion, but they can warp
and curve in response to the presence of matter or energy. such distortions to the fabric of space and
time,  as  we  shall  see,  transmit  the  force  of  gravity  from  one  place  to  another.  space  and  time,
therefore, can no longer to be thought of

burning them. during the past hundred years physicists have accumulated mounting evidence that all
of  these  interactions  between  various  objects  and  materials,  as  well  as  any  of  the  millions  upon
millions of others encountered daily, can be reduced to combinations of four fundamental forces. one
of these is the gravitational force. the other three are the electromagnetic force, the weak force, and
the strong force.

gravity is the most familiar of the forces, being responsible for keeping us in orbit around the
sun as well as for keeping our feet firmly planted on earth. the mass of an object measures how much
gravitational force it can exert as well as feel. the electromagnetic force is the next most familiar of
the  four.  it  is  the  force  driving  all  of  the  conveniences  of  modern  life—lights,  computers,  tvs,
telephones—and  underlies  the  awesome  might  of  lightning  storms  and  the  gentle

force as mass does for gravity: it determines how strongly the particle can exert as well as respond
electromagnetically.

the strong and the weak forces are less familiar because their strength rapidly diminishes over
all  but  subatomic  distance  scales;  they  are  the  nuclear  forces.  this  is  why  these  two  forces  were
discovered  only  much  more  recently.  the  strong  force  is  responsible  for  keeping  quarks  "glued"

by 1984 experimenters had definitively established the existence and the detailed properties of these
three kinds of force particles, recorded in table 1.2. physicists believe that the gravitational force
also  has  an  associated  particle—the  graviton—but  its  existence  has  yet  to  be  confirmed
experimentally.

the second common feature of the forces is that just as mass determines how gravity affects a
particle,  and  electric  charge  determines  how  the  electromagnetic  force  affects  it,  particles  are
endowed  with  certain  amounts  of  "strong  charge"  and  "weak  charge"  that  determine  how  they  are
affected by the strong and weak forces. (these properties are detailed in the table in the endnotes to
this chapter.1) but as with particle masses, beyond the fact that experimental physicists have carefully
measured  these  properties,  no  one  has  any  explanation  of

strong  and  weak  forces  confined  to  operate  on  microscopic  scales  while  gravity  and  the
electromagnetic  force  have  an  unlimited  range  of  influence? and  why  is  there  such  an  enormous
spread in the intrinsic strength of these forces?

to  appreciate  this  last  question,  imagine  holding  an  electron  in  your  left  hand  and  another
electron  in  your  right  hand  and  bringing  these  two  identical  electrically  charged  particles  close
together.  their  mutual  gravitational  attraction  will  favor  their  getting  closer  while  their

your right bicep represents the strength of the gravitational force, then your left bicep would have to

extend beyond the edge of the known universe to represent the strength of the electromagnetic force.
the  only  reason  the  electromagnetic  force  does  not  completely  overwhelm  gravity  in  the  world
around  us  is  that  most  things  are  composed  of  an  equal  amount  of  positive  and  negative  electric
charges whose forces cancel each other out. on the other hand, since gravity is always attractive,
there are no analogous cancellations—more stuff means greater gravitational force. but fundamentally
speaking, gravity is an extremely feeble force. (this fact accounts for the difficulty in experimentally

string theory has generated such excitement.

according to string theory, all such particles are actually tiny loops of vibrating string.

string theory as the unified theory of everything

in  einstein's  day,  the  strong  and  the  weak  forces  had  not  yet  been  discovered,  but  he  found  the
existence of even two distinct forces—gravity and electromagnetism—deeply troubling. einstein did
not accept that nature is founded on such an extravagant design. this launched his thirty-year voyage
in search of the so-called unified field theory that he hoped would show that these two forces are
really manifestations of one grand underlying principle. this quixotic quest isolated einstein from the
mainstream  of  physics,  which,  understandably,  was  far  more  excited  about  delving  into  the  newly
emerging framework of quantum m

it as its speed approaches that of light, it would require a push
with an infinite amount of energy to reach or to cross the light barrier. this, of course, is impossible
and hence absolutely nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.

as we shall see in the next chapter, this conclusion plants the seeds for the second major conflict
faced  by  physics  during  the  past  century  and  ultimately  spells  doom  for  another  venerable  and
cherished theory—newton's universal theory of gravity.

chapter 3

of warps and ripples

through special relativity einstein resolved the conflict between the "age-old intuition" about motion
and  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of  light.  in  short,  the  solution  is  that  our  intuition  is  wrong—it  is
informed by motion that typically is extremely slow compared to the speed of light, and such low
speeds obscure the true character of space and time. special relativity reveals their nature and shows
them  to  differ  radically  from  prev

ious  conceptions.  tinkering  with  our  understanding  of  the
foundations of space and time, though, was no small undertaking. einstein soon realized that of the
numerous  reverberations  following  from  the  revelations  of  special  relativity,  one  was  especially
profound: the dictum that nothing can outrun light proves to be incompatible with newton's revered
universal  theory  of  gravity,  proposed  in  the  latter  half  of  the  seventeenth  century. and  so,  while
resolving one conflict, special relativity gave rise to another. after a decade of intense, sometimes
tormented study, einstein resolved the dilemma with his general theory of relativity. in this theory,
einstein once again revolutionized our understanding of space and time by showing that they warp
and distort to communicate the force of gravity.

monumental intellect that, for example, when he found that the mathematics required for some of his
investigations did not exist, he invented it. nearly three centuries would pass before the world would
host a comparable scientific genius. of newton's numerous profound insights into the workings of the
universe, the one that primarily concerns us here is his universal theory of gravity.

the force of gravity pervades everyday life. it keeps us and all of the objects around us fixed to
the earth's surface; it keeps the air we breathe from escaping to outer space; it keeps the moon in orbit
around the earth and it keeps the earth bound in orbit around the sun. gravity dictates the rhythm of the
cosmic  dance  that  is  tirelessly  and  meticulously  executed  by  billions  upon  billions  of  cosmic
inhabitants,  from  asteroids  to  planets  to  stars  to  galaxies.  more  tha

influence causes us to take for granted that a single force—gravity—is responsible for this wealth of
terrestrial  and  extraterrestrial  happenings.  but  before  newton  there  was  no  understanding  that  an
apple falling to earth from a tree bore witness to the same physical principle that keeps the planets
revolving  around  the  sun.  with  an  audacious  step  in  the  service  of  scientific  hegemony,  newton
united  the  physics  governing  both  heaven  and  earth  and  declared  the  force  of  gravity  to  be  the
invisible hand at work in each

realm.

newton's  view  of  gravity  might  be  called  the  great  equalizer.  he  declared  that  absolutely
everything  exerts  an  attractive  gravitational  force  on  absolutely  everything  else.  regardless  of

physical composition, everything exerts as well as feels the force of gravity. based on a close study
of  johannes  kepler's  analysis  of  planetary  motion,  newton  deduced  that  the  strength  of  the
gravitational  attraction  between  two  bodies  depends  on precisely  two  things:  the  amount  of  stuff
composing each of the bodies and the distance between them. "stuff" means matter—this comprises
the total number of protons, neutrons, and electrons, which in turn determines the mass of the object.
newton's  universal  theory  of  gravity  asserts  that  the

attraction is larger for smaller separations between the objects and smaller for larger separations.

newton  went  much  further  than  this  qualitative  description  and  wrote  down  equations  that
quantitatively describe the strength of the gravitational force between two objects. in words, these
equations state that the gravitational force between two bodies is proportional to the product of their
masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. this "law of gravity"
can be used to predict the motion of planets and comets around the sun, the moon about the earth, and
rockets  heading  off  for  planetary  explorations,  as  well  as  more  earthbound  applications  such  as
baseballs  flying  through  the  air  and  divers  spiraling  poolward  from  springboards.  the  agreement
between the predictions and the actual observed motion of such objects is spectacular. this success
gave  newton's  theory  unequivocal  support  until  the  early  part  of  the

 twentieth  century.  einstein's
discovery of special relativity, however, raised what proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for
newton's theory.

the incompatibility of newtonian gravity and special relativity

a  central  feature  of  special  relativity  is  the  absolute  speed  barrier  set  by  light.  it  is  important  to
realize that this limit applies not only to material objects but also to signals and influences of any
kind. there is simply no way to communicate information or a disturbance from one place to another
at faster than light speed. of course, the world is full of ways for transmitting disturbances at slower
than the speed of light. your speech and all oth

ball being hit. a similar thing happens in a thunderstorm. although lightning and thunder are produced
simultaneously, you see the lightning before hearing the thunder. again, this reflects the substantial
speed difference between light and sound. the success of special relativity informs us that the reverse
situation,  in  which  some  signal  reaches  us before  the  light  it  emits,  is  just  not  possible.  nothing
outruns photons.

here's the rub. in newton's theory of gravity, one body exerts a gravitational pull on another
with  a  strength  determined  solely  by  the  mass  of  the  objects  involved  and  the  magnitude  of  their
separation.  the  strength  has  nothing  to  do  with  how  long  the  objects  have  been  in  each  other's
presence. this means that if their mass or their separation should change, the objects will, according
to newton, immediately feel a change in their mutual gravitational attraction. for instance, newton's
theory of gravity cla

uld be instantaneously transmitted to the earth through the

sudden change in the gravitational force governing its motion.

this  conclusion  is  in  direct  conflict  with  special  relativity,  since  the  latter  ensures  that  no
information can be transmitted faster than the speed of light—instantaneous transmission violates this
precept maximally.

in  the  early  part  of  the  twentieth  century,  therefore,  einstein  realized  that  the  tremendously
successful newtonian theory of gravity was in conflict with his special theory of relativity. confident
in  the  veracity  of  special  relativity  and  notwithstanding  the  mountain  of  experimental  support  for
newton's  theory,  einstein  sought  a  new  theory  of  gravity  compatible  with  special  relativity.  this
ultimately led him to the discovery of general relativity, in which the character of space and time
again went through a remarkable transformation.

einstein's happiest thought

even  before  the  discovery  of 
 
 ___________________________
 
 special  relativity,  newton's  theory  of  gravity  was  lacking  in  one
important respect. although it can be used to make highly accurate predictions about how objects will
move under the influence of gravity, it offers no insight into what gravity is. that is, how is it that two
bodies that are physically separate from another, possibly hundreds of millions of miles apart if not
more, nonetheless influence each other's motion? by what means does gravity execute its mission?
this is a problem of which newton himself was well aware. in his own words,

it is inconceivable, that inanimate brute matter, should, without the mediation of something
else,  which  is  not  material,  operate  upon  and  affect  other  matter  without  mutual  contact.
that gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to matter so that one body may act
upon another at a distance thro' a vacuum without the mediation of anything else, by and
through which their action

great  an  absurdity  that  i  believe  no  man  who  has  in  philosophical  matters  a  competent
faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly
according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, i have left to
the consideration of my readers.1

that is, newton accepted the existence of gravity and went on to develop equations that accurately
describe its effects, but he never offered any insight into how it actually works. he gave the world an
"owner's  manual"  for  gravity  which  delineated  how  to  "use"  it—instructions  that  physicists,
astronomers,  and  engineers  have  exploited  successfully  to  plot  the  course  of  rockets  to  the  moon,
mars, and other planets in the solar system; to predict solar and lunar eclipses; to predict the motion
of comets, and so on. but

 he left the inner workings—the contents of the "black box" of gravity—a
complete mystery. when you use your cd player or your personal computer, you may find yourself in
a similar state of ignorance regarding how it works internally. so long as you know how to operate
the equipment neither you nor anyone else needs to know how it accomplishes the tasks you set for it.
but if your cd player or personal computer breaks, its repair relies crucially on knowledge of its
internal workings. similarly, einstein realized that hundreds of years of experimental confirmati

notwithstanding, special relativity implied that in some subtle way newton's theory was "broken" and
that its repair required coming to grips with the question of the true and full nature of gravity.

in  1907,  while  pondering  these  issues  at  his  desk  in  the  patent  office  in  bern,  switzerland,

einstein had the central insight that, through fits and starts, would eventually lead him to a radically
new theory of gravity—an approach that would not merely fill in the gap in newton's theory, but,
rather, would completely reformulate thinking about gravity and, of utmost importance, would do so
in a manner fully consistent with special relativity.

the  insight  einstein  had  is  relevant  for  a  question  that  may  have  troubled  you  in  chapter  2.

do not think that your idea is dead at all. isaac's observation that gravity diminishes as the device is
lifted into space means that the reading on the scale will go down. my observation that the upward
acceleration of the rocket will cause the device to push harder against the scale means that the reading
will  go up.  taken  together,  this  means  that  if  we  carefully  adjust  the  precise  moment-to-moment
acceleration  of  the  rocket  as  it  moves  upward,  these  two  effects  can cancel  each  other  out!
specifically,  in  the  early  stages  of  liftoff, 
 
 ___________________________
 
 when  the  rocket  still  feels  the  full  force  of  the  earth's
gravity, it can accelerate, just not too severely, so that we stay within the 50 percent window. as the
rocket gets farther and farther from the earth—and therefore feels the earth's gravity less and less—
we need to increase its upward acceleration to compensate. the increase in the reading from upward
acceleration  can  exactly  equal  the  decrease  in  the  reading  from  the  diminishing  gravitational
attraction, so, in fact, we can keep the actual reading on the scale from changing at all!"

albert's  suggestion  slowly  begins  to  make  sense.  "in  other  words,"  you  respond,  "an  upward
acceleration can provide a stand-in or a substitute for gravity. we can imitate

through suitably accelerated motion."

"exactly," responds albert.
"so,"  you  continue,  "we can  launch  the  bomb  into  space  and  by  judiciously  adjusting  the
acceleration of the rocket we can ensure that the reading on the scale does not change, thus avoiding
detonation until it is a safe distance from earth." and so by playing off gravity and accelerated motion
—using the precision of twenty-first-century rocket science—you are able to stave off disaster.

the recognition that gravity and accelerated motion are profoundly interwoven is the key insight
that einstein had one happy day in the bern patent office. although the bomb experience highlights the
essence  of  his  idea,  it  is  worth  rephrasing  it  in  a  framework  closer  to  that  of  chapter  2.  for  this
purpose, recall that if you are put into a sealed, windo

by albert. similarly, if your compartment is being accelerated upward you will feel the force of the
floor on your feet. einstein's realization was that within the confines of your tiny compartment, you
will not be able to distinguish these accelerated situations from ones without acceleration  but with
gravity: when their magnitudes are judiciously adjusted, the force you feel from a gravitational field
or from accelerated motion are indistinguishable. if your compartment is placidly sitting upright on
the earth's surface, you will feel the familiar force of the floor on your feet, just as in the scenario of
upward  acceleration;  this  is  exactly  the  same  equivalence  albert  exploited  in  his  solution  for
launching the terrorist bomb into space. if your compartment is resting on its back end

 you will feel
the force of your seat on your back (preventing you from falling), just as when you were accelerating
horizontally.  einstein  called  the  indistinguishability  between  accelerated  motion  and  gravity  the
equivalence principle. it plays a central role in general relativity.2

this  description  shows  that  general  relativity  finishes  a  job  initiated  by  special  relativity.
through  its  principle  of  relativity,  the  special  theory  of  relativity  declares  a  democracy  of
observational  vantage  points:  the  laws  of  physics  appear  identical  to  all  observers  undergoing

constant-velocity motion. but this is limited democracy indeed, for it excludes an enormous number

erence between an accelerated vantage point without a gravitational
field  and  a  nonaccelerated  vantage  point with  a  gravitational  field,  we  can  invoke  the  latter
perspective and declare that all observers, regardless of their state of motion, may proclaim that
they  are  stationary  and  "the  rest  of  the  world  is  moving  by  them,"  so  long  as  they  include  a
suitable gravitational field in the description of their own surroundings. in this sense, through the
inclusion of gravity, general relativity ensures that all possible observational vantage points are on
equal footing. (as we shall see later, this means that distinctions between observers in chapter 2 that
relied on accelerated motion—as when george chased after gracie by turning on his jet-pack and
aged less than she—admit an equivalent description without acceleration, but with gravity.)

this  deep  connection  between  gravity  and  accelerated  motion  is  certainly  a  remarkable
realization,  but  why

did  it  make  einstein  so  happy?  the  reason,  simply  put,  is  that  gravity  is
mysterious. it is a grand force permeating the life of the cosmos, but it is elusive and ethereal. on the
other hand, accelerated motion, although somewhat more complicated than constant-velocity motion,
is  concrete  and  tangible.  by  finding  a  fundamental  link  between  the  two,  einstein  realized  that  he
could use his understanding of motion as a powerful tool toward gaining a similar understanding of
gravity.  putting  this  strategy  into  practice  was  no  small  task,  even
 
 ___________________________
 
  for  the  genius  of  einstein,  but
ultimately this approach bore the fruit of general relativity. achieving this end required that einstein
forge a second link in the chain uniting gravity and accelerated motion: the curvature of space and
time, to which we now turn.

acceleration and the warping of space and time

einstein worked on the problem of understanding gravity with extreme, almost obsessive, intensity.
about five years after his happy revelation in the bern patent office, he wrote to the physicist arnold
sommerfeld, "i am now working exclusively on the gravity problem. . .. [o]ne thing is certain—that
never in my life have i tormented myself anything like this. . .. compared to this problem the original
[i.e., special] relativity theory is child's play."3

he appears to have made the next key breakthrough, a simple yet subtle consequence of applyin

special relativity to the link between gravity and accelerated motion, in 1912. to understand this step
in  einstein's  reasoning  it  is  easiest  to  focus,  as  apparently  he  did,  on  a  particular  example  of
accelerated motion.4 recall that an object is accelerating if either the speed or the direction of its
motion changes. for simplicity we will focus on accelerated motion in which only the direction of
our object's motion changes while its speed stays fixed. specifically, we consider motion in a circle
such  as  what  one  exper

, keeping you moving in a circle. (in fact, although not
relevant for the present discussion, the spinning motion "pins" your body to the plexiglas with such a
force that when the ledge on which you are standing drops away you do not slip downward.) if the
ride is extremely smooth and you close your eyes, the pressure of the ride on your back—like the

support of a bed—can almost make you feel that you are lying down. the "almost" comes from the
fact that you still feel ordinary "vertical" gravity, so your brain cannot be fully fooled. but if you were
to ride the tornado in outer space, and if it were to spin at just the right rate, it would feel just like
lying in a stationary bed on earth. moreover, were you to "get up" and walk along the interior of the
spinning plexiglas, your feet would press against it just as they do against an earthbound floor. in fact,
space stations are designed to spin in this manner to create an artificial feeling of gravity in outer
space.

what about the ra

's-eye view we see that he is going to find the same answer as we did. the
reason is that the ruler is not pointing along the instantaneous direction of the motion of the ride (as it
is when measuring the circumference). instead, it is pointed at a ninety-degree angle to the motion,
and  therefore  it  is not  contracted  along  its  length.  jim  will  therefore  find  exactly  the  same  radial
length as we did.

having  used  the  accelerated  motion  of  the  spinning  tornado  to  imitate  gravity,  we  can  now
follow einstein and set out to see how space and time appear to someone on the ride. his reasoning,
adapted  to  this  situation,  went  as  follows.  we  stationary  observers  can  easily  measure  the
circumference and the radius of the spinning ride. for instance, to measure the circumference we can
carefully  lay  out  a  ruler—head  to  tail—alongside  the  ride's  spinning  girth;  for  its  radius  we  can
similarly use the head-to-tail method working our way from the

because not only does speed increase, but his acceleration increases as well, the farther he is from the
spinning  ride's  center.  on  the  tornado  ride,  then,  we  see  that  greater  acceleration  is  tied  up  with
slower clocks—that is, greater acceleration results in a more significant warping of time.

these  observations  took  einstein  to  the  final  leap.  since  he  had  already  shown  gravity  and
accelerated motion to be effectively indistinguishable, and since he now had shown that accelerated
motion  is  associated  with  the  warping  of  space  and  time,  he  made  the  following  proposal  for  the
innards of the "black box" of gravity—the mechanism by which gravity operates. gravity, according
to einstein, is the warping of space and time. let's see what this means.

the basics of general relativity

to get a feel for this new view of gravity, let's consider the prototypic

al situation of a planet, such as
the earth, revolving around a star, such as the sun. in newtonian gravity the sun keeps the earth in
orbit with an unidentified gravitational "tether" that somehow instantaneously reaches out across vast
distances of space and grabs hold of the earth (and, similarly, the earth reaches out and grabs hold of
the sun). einstein provided a new conception of what actually happens. it will aid in our discussion
of  einstein's  approach  to  have  a  concrete  visual  model  of  spacetime  that  we  can  conveniently
manipulate. to do so, we will simplify things in two ways

emselves out. the chain of einstein's reasoning that
we have been following, however, leads to a different conclusion.

a massive body like the sun, and indeed any body, exerts a gravitational force on other objects.
in the example of the terrorist bomb, we learned that gravitational forces are indistinguishable from
accelerated motion. in the example of the tornado ride, we learned that a mathematical description of
accelerated motion requires the relations of curved space. these links between gravity, accelerated
motion, and curved space led einstein to the remarkable suggestion that the presence of mass, such as
the sun, causes the fabric of space around it to warp, as shown in figure 3.4. a useful, and oft-quoted,
analogy is that much like a rubber membrane on which a bowling ball has been placed, the fabric of
space  becomes  distorted  due  to  the  presence  of  a  massive  object  like  the  sun. according  to  this
radical  proposal,  space  is  not  merely  a  passive  forum  provid

s absent, the
rubber membrane will be flat and the ball bearing will travel along a straight line. if the bowling ball
is present and thereby warps the membrane, the ball bearing will travel along a curved path. in fact,
ignoring friction, if we set the ball bearing moving with just the right speed in just the right direction,
it will continue to move in a recurring curved path around the bowling ball—in effect, it will "go into
orbit." our language presages the application of this analogy to gravity.

the sun, like the bowling ball, warps the fabric of space surrounding it, and the earth's motion,
like that of the ball bearing, is determined by the shape of the warp. the earth, like the ball bearing,
will move in orbit around the sun if its speed and orientation have suitable values. this effect on the
motion of the earth is what we normally would refer to as the gravitational influence of the sun, and is

stein  has  specified  the
mechanism by which gravity is transmitted: the warping of space. in einstein's view, the gravitational
tether holding the earth in orbit is not some mysterious instantaneous action of the sun; rather, it is the

warping of the spatial fabric caused by the sun's presence.

figure 3.5 the earth is kept in orbit around the sun because it rolls along a valley in the warped
spatial fabric. in more precise language, it follows a "path of least resistance" in the distorted region
around the sun.

this picture allows us to unde

rstand the two essential features of gravity in a new way. first, the
more massive the bowling ball, the greater the distortion it causes in the rubber membrane; similarly,
in einstein's description of gravity the more massive an object is, the greater the distortion it causes
in the surrounding space. this implies that the more massive an object, the greater the gravitational
influence it can exert on other bodies, precisely in accord with our experiences. second, just as the
distortion of the rubber membrane due to the bowling ball gets smaller as one gets farther from it, the
amount of spatial warping due to a massive body such as the sun decreases as one's distance from it
increases. this, again,

 jibes with our understanding of gravity, whose influence becomes weaker as
the distance between objects becomes larger.

an important point to note is that the ball bearing itself warps the rubber membrane, although
only slightly. similarly, the earth, being a massive body in its own right, also warps the fabric of
space, although far less than the sun. this is how, in the language of general relativity, the earth keeps
the moon in orbit, and it is also how the earth keeps each of us bound to its surface. as a skydiver

ard, he or she is sliding down a depression in the spatial fabric caused by the earth's
mass.  moreover,  each  of  us—like  any  massive  object—also  warps  the  spatial  fabric  in  close
proximity  to  our  bodies,  although  the  comparatively  small  mass  of  a  human  body  makes  this  a
minuscule indentation.

in summary then, einstein fully agreed with newton's statement that "gravity must be caused by
an  agent"  and  rose  to  newton's  challenge  in  which  the  identity  of  the  agent  was  left  "to  the
consideration of my readers." the agent of gravity, according to einstein, is the fabric of the cosmos.

a few caveats

the  rubber  membrane–bowling  ball  analogy  is  valuable  because  it  gives  us  a  visual  image  with
which we can grasp tangibly what we mean by a warp in the spatial fabric of the universe. physicists
often use this and similar analogies to g

uide their own intuition regarding gravitation and curvature.
however, its usefulness notwithstanding, the rubber membrane–bowling ball analogy is not perfect
and for clarity we call attention to a few of its shortcomings.

first,  when  the  sun  causes  the  fabric  of  space  around  it  to  warp  this  is  not  due  to  its  "being
pulled downward" by gravity as in the case of the bowling ball, which warps the rubber membrane
because it is pulled earthward by gravity. in the case of the sun, there is no other object to "do the
pulling." instead, einstein has taught us that the warping of space is gravity. the mere presence of an
object with mass causes space to respond by warping. similarly, the earth is not kept in orbit because
the gravitational pull of some other external object guides it along the valleys in the warped spatial
environment, as occurs for a ball bearing on the warped rubber membrane. instead, einstein showed
that objects move through spac

precisely) along the shortest possible paths—the
"easiest possible paths" or the "paths of least resistance." if the space is warped, such paths will be
curved. and so, although the rubber membrane–bowling ball model provides a good visual analogy
of how an object such as the sun warps the space around it and thereby influences the motion of other
bodies,  the  physical  mechanism  by  which  these  distortions  occur  is  totally  different.  the  former
appeals  to  our  intuition  about  gravity  in  the  traditional  newtonian  framework,  whereas  the  latter
expresses a reformulation of gravity in terms of curved space.

a second shortcoming of the analogy stems from the rubber membrane's being two-dimensional.
in  reality,  although  harder  to  visualize,  the  sun  (and  all  other  massive  objects)  actually  warps  the
three-dimensional space surrounding it. figure 3.6 is a rough attempt to depict this; all of the space
surrounding  the  sun—"below,"  "on  the  sides,"  on

 the earth slam into the "vertical part" of curved space in the image? bear in
mind, though, that space, unlike the rubber membrane, is not a solid barrier. instead, the warped grids
in the image are but a couple of thin slices through the full three-dimensional warped space in which
you, the earth, and everything else are immersed fully and move freely. perhaps you find that this only
makes the problem seem worse: why don't we feel space if we are immersed within its fabric? but
we do. we feel gravity, and space is the medium by which the gravitational force is communicated.
as  the  eminent  physicist  john  wheeler  has  often  said  in  describing  gravity,  "mass  grips  space  by
telling it how to curve, space grips mass by telling it how to move."8

a third, related shortcoming of the analogy is that we have suppressed the time dimension. we
have done this for visual clarity because, notwithstanding the declaration of special relativity that we
should think of the time dimension on par

 with the three familiar spatial dimensions, it is significantly
harder to "see" time. but, as illustrated by the example of the tornado ride, acceleration—and hence
gravity—warps both space and time. (in fact, the mathematics of general relativity shows that in the
case of a relatively slow-moving body like the earth revolving around a typical star like the sun, the
warping of time actually has a far more significant impact on the earth's motion than does the warping
of space.) we will return to a discussion of the warping of time after the next section.

caveats are, so long as you hold them in the back of your mind, it is
perfectly acceptable to invoke the warped-space image provided by the bowling ball on the rubber
membrane as an intuitive summary of einstein's new view of gravity.

conflict resolution

by introducing space and time as dynamic players, einstein provided a clear conceptual image of
how gravity works. the central question, though, is whether this reformulation of the gravitational
force  resolves  the  conflict  with  special  relativity  that  afflicts  newton's  theory  of  gravity.  it  does.
again, the rubber membrane analogy gives the essential idea. imagine that we have a ball bearing
rolling in a straight line along the flat membrane in the absence of the bowling ball. as we place the
bowling  ball  on  the  membrane  the  motion  of  the  ball  bearing  will  be  affected,  bu

elf  toward  the  sun. as  he  does  so,  he
periodically  stops  so  that  he  and  gracie  can  compare  the  rate  at  which  time  is  elapsing  on  their
clocks.  the  warping  of  time  predicted  by  einstein's  general  relativity  implies  that  george's  clock
will  run  slower  and  slower  compared  with  gracie's  as  the  gravitational  field  he  experiences  gets
stronger and stronger. that is, the closer he gets to the sun the slower his clock will run. it is in this
sense that gravity distorts time as well as space.

you should note that unlike the case in chapter 2 in which george and gracie were in empty
space moving relative to each other with constant velocity, in the present setting there is no symmetry
between them. george, unlike gracie, feels the force of gravity getting stronger and stronger—he has
to hold the cable tighter and tighter as he gets closer to the sun to avoid being pulled in. each of them
agrees that george's clock is running slow. there is no "equal

would cause his clock to tick at about 76 percent of the rate of gracie's. stronger gravitational fields,
such as those just outside a black hole (as discussed below), cause the flow of time to slow even
further; stronger gravitational fields cause a more severe warping of time.

experimental verification of general relativity

most people who study general relativity are captivated by its aesthetic elegance. by replacing the
cold,  mechanistic  newtonian  view  of  space,  time,  and  gravity  with  a  dynamic  and  geometric
description involving curved spacetime, einstein wove gravity into the basic fabric of the universe.
rather than being imposed as an additional structure, gravity becomes part and parcel of the universe
at its most fundamental level. breathing life into space and time by allowing them to curve, warp, and
ripple results in what we commonly refer to as gravity.

aesthetics  aside,  the  ultimate  test  of  a  physical  theory  is  its  ability  to  explain  and  
 
 ___________________________
 
predict
physical  phenomena  accurately.  since  its  inception  in  the  late  1600s  until  the  beginning  of  this
century,  newton's  theory  of  gravity  passed  this  test  with  flying  colors.  whether  applied  to  balls
thrown up in the air, objects dropped from leaning towers, comets whirling around the sun, or planets
going  about  their  solar  orbits,  newton's  theory  provides  extremely  accurate  explanations  of  all

observations  as  well  as  predictions  that  have  been  verified  innumerable  times  in  a  wealth  of
situations.  the  motivation  for  questioning  this  experimentally  successful  theory,  as  we  have

asized, was its property of instantaneous transmission of the gravitational force, in conflict with
special relativity.

the effects of special relativity, although central to a fundamental understanding of space, time,
and  motion,  are  extremely  small  in  the  slow-velocity  world  we  typically  inhabit.  similarly,  the
deviations  between  einstein's  general  relativity—a  theory  of  gravity  compatible  with  special
relativity—and newton's theory of gravity are also extremely small in most common situations. this
is both good and bad. it is good because any theory purporting to supplant newton's theory of gravity
had  better  closely  agree  with  it  when  applied  in  those  arenas  in  which  newton's  theory  has  been
experimentally verified. it is bad because it makes it difficult to adjudicate between the two theories

differ. if you throw a baseball, newtonian and einsteinian gravity can be used to predict where it

the starlight's path results in a shift in the apparent position of the star. the shift can be accurately
measured  by  comparing  this  apparent  position  with  the  star's actual  location  known  from
observations of the star at night (in the absence of the sun's warping influence), carried out when the
earth is at an appropriate position, some six months earlier or later. in november of 1915, einstein
used his new understanding of gravity to calculate the angle through which starlight signals that just
graze the sun would be bent and found the answer to be about.00049 of a degree (1.75 arcseconds,
where an arcsecond is 1/3600 of a degree). this tiny angle is equal to that subtended by a quarter
placed upright and viewed from nearly two miles away. the detection of such a small angle was,
however, within reach of the technology of the day. at the urging of sir frank dyson, director of the

reproduce  and  raised  some  questions  regarding  the  trustworthiness  of  the  original  experiment.
nevertheless, in the last 40 years a variety of experiments making use of technological advancements
have tested numerous aspects of general relativity with great precision. the predictions of general
relativity have been uniformly confirmed. there is no longer any doubt that einstein's description of
gravity is not only compatible with special relativity, but yields predictions closer to experimental
results than those of newton's theory.

black holes, the big bang, and the expansion of space

whereas special relativity is most manifest when things are moving fast, general relativity comes into
its own when things are very massive and the warps in space and time are correspondingly severe.
let's describe two examples.

finishing touches on general relativity, schwarzschild was able to use the theory to gain a complete
and exact understanding of the way space and time warp in the vicinity of a perfectly spherical star.

seemingly gargantuan black hole pales in comparison to what astronomers believe to reside in the
core  of  the  astonishingly  luminous  quasars  that  are  scattered  throughout  the  cosmos:  black  holes
whose masses may well be billions of times that of the sun.

schwarzschild  died  only  a  few  months  after  finding  his  solution,  from  a  skin  disease  he
contracted at the russian front. he was 42. his tragically brief encounter with einstein's theory of
gravity uncovered one of the most striking and mysterious facets of the natural world.

the  second  example  in  which  general  relativity  flexes  its  muscle  concerns  the  origin  and
evolution of the whole universe. as we have seen, einstein showed that space and time respond to the
presence of mass and energy. this distortion of spacetime affects the motion of other cosmic bodies
moving in the vicinity of the resulting warps. in turn, the precise way in which these bodies move, by

ultimately uncover some, thereby showing this theory, too, to be only an approximate description of
how nature actually works. the systematic testing of theories to greater and greater levels of accuracy
is, certainly, one of the ways science progresses, but it is not the only way. in fact, we have already
seen this: the search for a new theory of gravity was initiated, not by an experimental refutation of
newton's  theory,  but  rather  by  the  conflict  of  newtonian  gravity  with  another theory—special
relativity. it was only after the discovery of general relativity as a competing theory of gravity that
experimental flaws in newton's theory were identified by seeking out tiny but measurable ways in
which the two theories differ. thus, internal theoretical inconsistencies can play as pivotal a role in
driving progress as do experimental

for  the  last  half  century,  physics  has  been  faced  with  still  another  theoretical  conflict  whose

appears  to  be  fundamentally  incompatible  with  another  extremely  well-tested  theory: quantum
mechanics.  regarding  the  material  covered  in  this  chapter,  the  conflict  prevents  physicists  from
understanding  what  really  happens  to  space,  time,  and  matter  when  crushed  together  fully  at  the
moment of the big bang or at the central point of a black hole. but more generally, the conflict alerts
us to a fundamental deficiency in our conception of n

thereby confirming the wave picture. newton's corpuscular view was defeated (although it took quite
some time before physicists accepted this). the prevailing wave view of light was subsequently put
on a mathematically firm foundation by maxwell.

figure 4.8 if light is a wave, then when both slits are open there will be interference between the
portions of the wave emerging from each slit.

but einstein, the man who brought down newton's revered theory of gravity, seems now to have
resurrected newton's particle model of light by his introduction of photons. of course, we still face
the  same  question:  how  can  a  particle  perspective  account  for  the  interference  pattern  shown  in
figure  4.8?  at  first  blush  you  might  make  the  following  suggestion.  water  is  composed  of  h 2o

think of as being so basic as to be beyond question—that objects have definite positions and speeds
and that they have definite energies at definite moments—are now seen as mere artifacts of planck's
constant being so tiny on the scales of the everyday world. of prime importance is that when this
quantum realization is applied to the fabric of spacetime, it shows fatal imperfections in the "stitches
of gravity" and leads us to the third and primary conflict physics has faced during the past century.

the need for a new theory: general relativity vs. quantum

mechanics

our  understanding  of  the  physical  universe  has  deepened  profoundly  during  the  past  century.  the
theoretical  tools  of  quantum  mechanics  and  general  relativity  allow  us  to  understand  and  make
testable  predictions  about  physical  happenings  from  the  atomic  and  subatomic  realms  all  the  way

locked  up  inside  of  protons  and  neutrons,  arises  from  individual  quarks  exchanging  gluons.  the
gluons, so to speak, provide the "glue" that keeps these subatomic particles stuck together. the weak
force, which is responsible for certain kinds of particle transmutations involved in radioactive decay,
is mediated by the weak gauge bosons.

gauge symmetry

you may have realized that the odd man out in our discussion of the quantum theory of the forces of
nature is gravity. given the successful approach physicists have used with the other three forces, you
might suggest that physicists seek a quantum field theory of the gravitational force—a theory in which

recall that the gravitational force allows us to declare that all observers—regardless of their
state of motion—are on absolutely equal footing. even those whom we would normally think of as
accelerating  may  claim  to  be  at  rest,  since  they  can  attribute  the  force  they  feel  to  their  bei

immersed in a gravitational field. in this sense, gravity enforces the symmetry: it ensures the equal
validity of all possible observational points of view, all possible frames of reference. the similarity
with the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces is that they too are all connected with enforcing
symmetries, albeit ones that are significantly more abstract than the one associated with gravity.

to  get  a  rough  feel  for  these  rather  subtle  symmetry  principles,  let's  consider  one  important
example. as we recorded in the table in endnote 1 of chapter 1, each quark comes in three "colors"
(fancifully called red, green, and blue, although these are merely labels and have no relation to color
in the usual visual sense), which determine how it responds to the strong force in much the same way
that its electric charge determines how it responds to the electromagnetic force. all

interactions  between  the  particles  completely  unchanged.  for  the  case  of  the  gauge  symmetry
associated with shifting quark-color charges, the required force is none other than the strong force
itself.  that  is,  without  the  strong  force,  physics would  change  under  the  kinds  of  shifts  of  color
charges indicated above. this realization shows that, although the gravitational force and the strong
force have vastly different properties (recall, for example, that gravity is far feebler than the strong
force and operates over enormously larger distances), they do have a somewhat similar heritage: they
are  each  required  in  order  that  the  universe  embody  particular  symmetries.  moreover,  a  similar
discussion applies to the weak and electromagnetic forces, showing that their existence, too, is bound
up with yet other gauge symmetries—the so-called weak and electromagnetic gauge symmetries. and

hence, all four forces are directly associated with prin

by contrast, the standard model views the elementary constituents of the universe as pointlike
ingredients  with  no  internal  structure.  as  powerful  as  this  approach  is  (as  we  have  mentioned,
essentially  every  prediction  about  the  microworld  made  by  the  standard  model  has  been  verified
down to about a billionth of a billionth of a meter, the present-day technological limit), the standard
model cannot be a complete or final theory because it does not include gravity. moreover, attempts to
incorporate gravity into its quantum-mechanical framework have failed due to the violent fluctuations
in  the  spatial  fabric  that  appear  at  ultramicroscopic  distances—that  is,  distances  shorter  than  the
planck  length.  the  unresolved  conflict  has  impelled  a  search  for  an  even  deeper  understanding  of
nature. in 1984, the physicists michael green, then of queen mary college, and john schwarz of the

schwarz found these properties to be realized exactly by certain vibrational patterns. based on this,
scherk and schwarz suggested that string theory had failed in its initial attempt because physicists had
unduly constrained its scope. string theory is not just a theory of the strong force, they proclaimed; it
is a quantum theory that includes gravity as well.3

the  physics  community  did  not  receive  this  suggestion  with  unbridled  enthusiasm.  in  fact,
schwarz recounts that "our work was universally ignored."4 the path of progress was already littered
with numerous failed attempts to unite gravity and quantum mechanics. string theory had been shown
wrong in its initial effort to describe the strong force, and it seemed to many that it was senseless to
try to use the theory to pursue an even grander goal. even more devastating, subs

  1984. although  i  was  excited  to  be
learning  about  the  likes  of  quantum  field  theory,  gauge  theory,  and  general  relativity,  there  was  a
pervasive  feeling  among  the  older  graduate  students  that  there  was  little  or  no  future  for  particle
physics.  the  standard  model  was  in  place  and  its  remarkable  success  at  predicting  experimental
outcomes indicated that its verification was merely a matter of time and details. going beyond its
limits  to  include  gravity  and  possibly  to explain the experimental input on which it relies—the 19
numbers summarizing the elementary particle masses, their force charges, and the relative strengths of
the  forces,  numbers  that  are  known  from  experiment  but  are  not  understood  theoretically—was  so
daunting a task that all but the most courageous physicists recoiled at the challenge. but six months
later  the  mood  had  swung  completely  around.  the  success  of  green  and  schwarz  finally  trickle

a vis other forces. the electric charge, the weak charge, and the strong charge carried by a particular
string, for instance, are determined by the precise way it vibrates. moreover, exactly the same idea
holds for the messenger particles themselves. particles like photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons
are yet other resonant patterns of string vibration. and of particular importance, among the vibrational
string patterns, one matches perfectly the properties of the graviton, ensuring that gravity is an integral
part of string theory.7

so we see that, according to string theory, the observed properties of each elementary particle
arise because its internal string undergoes a particular resonant vibrational pattern. this perspective
differs sharply from that espoused by physicists before the discovery of string theory; in the earlier
perspective the differences among the fundamental particles were explained by saying that, in effect,
each  particle  species  was  "cut  from  a  different

 to the present day, as such super-
heavy particles are usually unstable, relinquishing their enormous mass by decaying into a cascade of
ever  lighter  particles,  ending  with  the  familiar,  relatively  light  particles  in  the  world  around  us.
however, it is possible that such a super-heavy vibrational string state—a relic from the big bang—
did survive to the present. finding such particles, as we discuss more fully in chapter 9, would be a
monumental discovery, to say the least.

gravity and quantum mechanics in string theory

the unified framework that string theory presents is compelling. but its real attraction is the ability to
ameliorate  the  hostilities  between  the  gravitational  force  and  quantum  mechanics.  recall  that  the
problem in merging general relativity and quantum mechanics turns up when the central tenet of the
former—that  space  and  time  constitute  a  smoothly  curving  geometrical  structure—confronts  the
essential feature of the latter—th

distance scales. like our fingers on granite, the
string  smears  out  the  jittery  ultramicroscopic  fluctuations  of  the  gravitational  field.  although  the
resulting  fluctuations  are  still  substantial,  this  smearing  smooths  them  out  just  enough  to  cure  the
incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics. and, in particular, the pernicious
infinities (discussed in the preceding chapter) that arise in the point-particle approach to forming a
quantum theory of gravity are done away with by string theory.

an essential difference between the granite analogy and our real concern with the spatial fabric
is that there are ways in which the microscopic discreteness of the granite's surface can be exposed:
finer, more precise probes than our fingers can be used. an electron microscope has the ability to
resolve surface features to less than a millionth of a centimeter; this is sufficiently small to reveal the
numerous  surface  imperfections.  by  contrast,  in  s

therefore,  it  seemed  impossible  to  find  a  sensible  quantum  theory  based  on  anything  but  point
particles.  the  truly  impressive  feature  of  string  theory  is  that  more  than  twenty  years  of  exacting
research has shown that although certain features are unfamiliar, string theory does respect all of the
requisite properties inherent in any sensible physical theory. and furthermore, through its graviton
pattern of vibration, string theory is a quantum theory containing gravity.

the more precise answer

the rough answer captures the essence of why string theory prevails where previous point-particle
theories failed. and so, if you like, you can go on to the next section without losing the logical flow of
our  discussion.  but  having  developed  the  essential  ideas  of  special  relativity  in  chapter  2,  we
already have the necessary tools for describing more accurately how string theory calms the violent
quantum jitters.

vity spread,
a student asked einstein about what he would have thought if eddington's experiment had not found
the predicted bending of starlight. einstein replied, "then i would have been sorry for the dear lord,
for the theory is correct."1 of course, had experiments truly failed to confirm einstein's predictions,
the  theory  would  not  be  correct  and  general  relativity  would  not  have  become  a  pillar  of  modern
physics. but what einstein meant is that general relativity describes gravity with such a deep inner
elegance, with such simple yet powerful ideas, that he found it hard to imagine that nature could pass
it by. general relativity, in einstein's view, was almost too beautiful to be wrong.

aesthetic  judgments  do  not  arbitrate  scientific  discourse,  however.  ultimately,  theories  are
judged  by  how  they  fare  when  faced  with  cold,  hard,  experimental  facts.  but  this  last  remark  is
subject to an immensely important qualification. while a theory is being

possibility that a whole new kind of physics prevails elsewhere, but everything points to the contrary.
again, this does not mean that the universe looks the same—or has the same detailed properties
—in different locations. an astronaut jumping on a pogo stick on the moon can do all sorts of things
that are impossible to do on earth. but we recognize that the difference arises because the moon is far
less massive than the earth; it does not mean that the law of gravity is somehow changing from place
to place. newton's, or more precisely, einstein's, law of gravity is the same on earth as it is on the
moon.  the  difference  in  the  astronaut's  experience  is  one  of  change  in  environmental  detail,  not
variation of physical law.

physicists describe these two properties of physical laws—that they do not depend on when or
where you use them—as symmetries of nature. by this usage physicists mean that nature treats every

 laws.

through  the  equivalence  principle  of  general  relativity,  einstein  significantly  extended  this
symmetry by showing that the laws of physics are actually identical for all observers, even if they are
undergoing complicated accelerated motion. recall that einstein accomplished this by realizing that
an accelerated observer is also perfectly justified in declaring himself or herself to be at rest, and in
claiming that the force he or she feels is due to a gravitational field. once gravity is included in the
framework, all possible observational vantage points are on a completely equal footing. beyond the
intrinsic aesthetic appeal of this egalitarian treatment of all motion, we have seen that these symmetry
principles played a pivotal role in the stunning conclusions regarding gravity that einstein found.

are there any other symmetry principles having to do with space, time, and motion that the laws
of nature should respect? if you think about this you might come up with one mo

spinning characteristic that turns out to be twice that of the matter particles. they all have "spin-1."

what  about  gravity?  well,  even  before  string  theory,  physicists  were  able  to  determine  what
spin the hypothesized graviton must have to be the transmitter of the gravitational force. the answer:
twice the spin of photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—i.e., "spin-2."

in the context of string theory, spin—just like mass and force charges—is associated with the
pattern of vibration that a string executes. as with point particles, it's a bit misleading to think of the
spin carried by a string as ar

a loose picture to have in mind. by the way, we can now clarify an important issue we encountered
earlier. in 1974, when scherk and schwarz proclaimed that string theory should be thought of as a
quantum theory incorporating the gravitational force, they did so because they had found that strings
necessarily  have  a  vibrational  pattern  in  their  repertoire  that  is massless  and  has  spin-2—the
hallmark features of the graviton. where there is a graviton there is also gravity.

supersymmetry and superpartners

as we have emphasized, the concept of spin, although superficially akin to the image of a spinning
top, differs in substantial ways that are rooted in quantum mechanics. its discovery in 1925 revealed
that  there  is  another  kind  of  rotational  motion  that  simply  would  not  exist  in  a  purely  classical
universe.

second, even within the standard model, a theory that ignores gravity, thorny technical issues
that are associated with quantum processes are swiftly solved if the theory is supersymmetric. the
basic problem is that every distinct particle species makes its own contribution to the microscopic

supersymmetry.

surprisingly kaluza found extra equations beyond those einstein originally derived. after studying the
extra  equations  associated  with  the  new  dimension,  kaluza  realized  that  something  amazing  was
going on. the extra equations were none other than those maxwell had written down in the 1880s for
describing  the  electromagnetic  force!  by  adding  another  space  dimension,  kaluza  had  united
einstein's theory of gravity with maxwell's theory of light.

before  kaluza's  suggestion,  gravity  and  electromagnetism  were  thought  of  as  two  unrelated
forces;  nothing  had  even  hinted  that  there  might  be  a  relation  between  them.  by  having  the  bold
creativity to imagine that our universe has an additional space dimension, kaluza suggested that there
was  a  deep  connection,  indeed.  his  theory  argued  that  both  gravity  and  electromagnetism  are

einstein wrote back to kaluza and told him that it had never occurred to him that unification might be

unresolved,  many  felt  that  the  major  questions  concerning  the  strong,  weak,  and  electromagnetic
forces had been answered.

the time was finally ripe to return to the grandest question of all: the enigmatic conflict between
general relativity and quantum mechanics. the success in formulating a quantum theory of three of
nature's forces emboldened physicists to try to bring the fourth, gravity, into the fold. having pursued
numerous  ideas  that  all  ultimately  failed,  the  mind-set  of  the  community  became  more  open  to
comparatively radical approaches. after being left for dead in the late 1920s, kaluza-klein theory
was resuscitated.

since kaluza's original proposal. quantum mechanics had been fully formulated and experimentally

the  most  promising  of  the  higher-dimensional  proposals  were  those  that  also  incorporated
supersymmetry. physicists hoped that the partial cancelling of the most severe quantum fluctuations,
arising from the pairing of superpartner particles, would help to soften the hostilities between gravity
and  quantum  mechanics.  they  coined  the  name higher-dimensional supergravity  to  describe  those
theories encompassing gravity, extra dimensions, and supersymmetry.

as  had  been  the  case  with  kaluza's  original  attempt,  various  versions  of  higher-dimensional
supergravity looked quite promising at first. the new equations resulting from the extra dimensions
were strikingly reminiscent of those used in the description of electromagnetism, and the strong and

our  world  without  subjecting  its  predictions  to  experimental  verification.  and  no  matter  how
compelling a picture string theory paints, if it does not accurately describe our universe, it will be no
more relevant than an elaborate game of dungeons and dragons.

edward  witten  is  fond  of  declaring  that  string  theory  has  already  made  a  dramatic  and
experimentally  confirmed  prediction:  "string  theory  has  the  remarkable  property  of predicting
gravity."1 what witten means by this is that both newton and einstein developed theories of gravity
because their observations of the world clearly showed them that gravity exists, and that, therefore, it
required an accurate and consistent explanation. on the contrary, a physicist studying string theory—
even if he or she was completely unaware of general relativity—would be inexorably led to it by the
string framework. through its massless spin-2 graviton pattern of vibration, string theory has g

thoroughly sewn into its theoretical fabric. as witten has said, "the fact that gravity is a consequence
of  string  theory  is  one  of  the  greatest  theoretical  insights  ever."2  in  acknowledging  that  this
"prediction" is more precisely labeled a "postdiction" because physicists had discovered theoretical
descriptions of gravity before they knew of string theory, witten points out that this is a mere accident
of history on earth. in other advanced civilizations in the universe, witten fancifully argues, it is quite
possible  that  string  theory  was  discovered  first,  and  a  theory  of  gravity  found  as  a  stunning
consequence.

since  we  are  bound  to  the  history  of  science  on  our  planet,  there  are  many  who  find  this
postdiction of gravity unconvincing experimental confirmation of string theory.

and he even questioned whether string theorists should "be paid by physics departments and allowed
to pervert impressionable students," warning that string theory was was undermining science, much as
medieval theology did during the middle ages.5

richard feynman, shortly before he died, made it clear that he did not believe that string theory

my feeling has been—and i could be wrong—that there is more than one way to skin a
cat. i don't think that there's only one way to get rid of the infinities. the fact that a theory
gets rid of infinities is to me not a sufficient reason to believe its uniqueness.6

and howard georgi, glashow's eminent harvard colleague and collaborator, was also a vociferous
string critic in the late 1980s:

because we will lose that crucial process of pruning of irrelevant ideas which distinguishes
physics from so many other less interesting human activities.7

as with many issues of great importance, for each of these naysayers, there is an enthusiastic
supporter. witten has said that when he learned how string theory incorporates gravity and quantum
mechanics, it was "the greatest intellectual thrill" of his life.8 cumrun vafa, a leading string theorist
from harvard university, has said that "string theory is definitely revealing the deepest understanding
of the universe which we have ever had."9 and nobel prize–winner murray gell-mann has said that
string theory is "a fantastic thing" and that he expects that some version of string theory will someday
be the theory of the whole world.10

string  theory  provides  a  framework  for  explaining  the  observed  messenger-particle  content  of  our
universe,  that  is,  for  explaining  the  properties  of  the  fundamental  forces,  but  that  without  knowing
exactly which calabi-yau shape the extra dimensions are curled into, we cannot make any definitive
predictions or postdictions (beyond witten's remark regarding the postdiction of gravity).

why can't we figure out which is the "right" calabi-yau shape? most string theorists blame this
on the inadequacy of the theoretical tools currently being used to analyze string theory. as we shall
discuss in some detail in chapter 12, the mathematical framework of string theory is so complicated
that physicists have been able to perform only approximate calculations through a formalism known
as perturbation theory. in this approximation scheme, each possible calabi-yau shape appears to be

central concern to all string theorists, but they are also questions about which nothing can really be
said. only the passage of time will reveal the answers. the beautiful simplicity of string theory, the
way in which it tames the conflict between gravity and quantum mechanics, its ability to unify all of
nature's  ingredients,  and  its  potential  of  limitless  predictive  power  all  serve  to  provide  rich
inspiration that makes the risk worth taking.

quantum geometry

in  the  course  of  about  a  decade,  einstein  singlehandedly  overthrew  the  centuries-old  newtonian
framework and gave the world a radically new and demonstrably deeper understanding of gravity. it
does  not  take  much  to  get  experts  and  nonexperts  alike  to  gush  over  the  sheer  brilliance  and
monumental  originality  of  einstein's  accomplishment  in  fashioning  general  relativity.  nevertheless,
we  should  not  lose  sight  of  the  favorable  historical  circumstances  that  strongly  contributed  to
einstein's success. foremost among these are the nineteenth-century mathematical insights of georg
bernhard riemann that firmly established the geometrical apparatus fo

athematical
treatment  of  geometry  on  all  varieties  of  curved  surfaces.  it  is  riemann's  insights  that  provide  the
mathematics for quantitatively analyzing warped spaces such as those illustrated in figures 3.4 and
3.6.  einstein's  genius  lay  in  recognizing  that  this  body  of  mathematics  was  tailor-made  for
implementing  his  new  view  of  the  gravitational  force.  he  boldly  declared  that  the  mathematics  of
riemann's geometry aligns perfectly with the physics of gravity.

but  now,  almost  a  century  after  einstein's  tour-de-force,  string  theory  gives  us  a  quantum-
mechanical description of gravity that, by necessity, modifies general relativity when the distances
involved become as short as the planck length. since riemannian geometry is the mathematical core
of  general  relativity,  this  means  that  it  too  must  be  modified  in  order  to  reflect  faithfully  the  new
short-distance physics of string theory. whereas general relativity assert

reflects  the
distorted distance relations between its points. physically, the gravitational force felt by an object is
a direct reflection of this distortion. in fact, by making the object smaller and smaller, the physics and
the  mathematics  align  ever  more  precisely  as  we  get  closer  and  closer  to  physically  realizing  the
abstract  mathematical  concept  of  a  point.  but  string  theory  limits  how  precisely  riemann's
geometrical formalism can be realized by the physics of gravity, because there is a limit to how small
we can make any object. once you get down to strings, you can't go any further. the traditional notion
of  a  point  particle  does  not  exist  in  string  theory—an  essential  element  in  its  ability  to  give  us  a
quantum theory of gravity. this concretely shows us that riemann's geometrical framework, which
relies fundamentally upon distances between points, is modified on ultramicroscopic scales by string
theory.

theorists is that, regardless of shape, there is a minimum limiting size, much as in the case of circular

dimensions, so long as we are shrinking a full spatial dimension. establishing this expectation is an
important goal for further research because it has a direct impact on a number of aspects of string
theory, including its implications for cosmology.

mirror symmetry

through general relativity, einstein forged a link between the physics of gravity and the geometry of
spacetime.  at  first  blush,  string  theory  strengthens  and  broadens  the  link  between  physics  and
geometry, since the properties of vibrating strings—their mass and the force charges they carry—are
largely determined by the properties of the curled-up component of space. we have just seen, though,
that  quantum  geometry—the  geometry-physics  association  in  string  theory—has  some  surprising
twists. in general relativity, and in "conventional" geometry

occur only if they are deeply hidden from our view behind the shroud of an event horizon. on the
other hand, prior to the discovery of string theory, some physicists surmised that a proper merger of
quantum mechanics and general relativity would show that the apparent puncture of space is actually
smoothed out—"sewn up," so to speak—by quantum considerations.

with  the  discovery  of  string  theory  and  the  harmonious  merger  of  quantum  mechanics  and
gravity,  we  are  finally  poised  to  study  these  issues. as  yet,  string  theorists  have  not  been  able  to
answer  them  fully,  but  during  the  last  few  years  closely  related  issues have  been  solved.  in  this
chapter  we  discuss  how  string  theory,  for  the  first  time,  definitively  shows  that  there  are  physical

circumstances—differing from wormholes and black holes in certain ways—in which the fabric of
space can tear.

unexpected links encourage us to follow witten and press on to the other two string theories, type iia
and  heterotic-e,  to  see  how  they  fit  into  the  overall  picture.  here  we  will  find  even  more  exotic
surprises. to prepare ourselves, we need a brief historical digression.

supergravity

in  the  late  1970s  and  early  1980s,  before  the  surge  of  interest  in  string  theory,  many  theoretical
physicists  sought  a  unified  theory  of  quantum  mechanics,  gravity,  and  the  other  forces  in  the
framework  of  point-particle  quantum  field  theory.  the  hope  was  that  the  inconsistencies  between
point-particle  theories  involving  gravity  and  quantum  mechanics  would  be  overcome  by  studying
theories with a great deal of symmetry. in 1976 stanley deser

and bruno zumino working at cern,
and independantly, daniel freedman, sergio ferrara, and peter van nieuwenhuizen, all then of the
state  university  of  new  york  at  stony  brook,  discovered  that  the  most  promising  were  those
involving  supersymmetry,  since  the  tendency  of  bosons  and  fermions  to  give  cancelling  quantum
fluctuations helps to calm the violent microscopic frenzy. the authors coined the term supergravity to
describe  supersymmetric  quantum  field  theories  that  try  to  incorporate  general  relativity.  such
attempts  to  merge  general  relativity  with  quantum  mechanics  ultimately  met  with  failure.
nevertheless,  as  mentioned  in  chapter  8,  there  was  a  prescient  lesson  to  be  learned  from  these
investigations, one that presaged the development of string theory.

the lesson, which perhaps became most clear through the work of eugene cremmer, bernard

specifically, the most promising were the versions calling for ten or eleven dimensions, with eleven
dimensions, it turns out, being the maximal possible.11 contact with four observed dimensions was
accomplished in the framework, once again, of kaluza and klein: the extra dimensions were curled

ional theory.

when  string  theory  took  physicists  by  storm  in  1984,  the  perspective  on  point-particle
supergravity theories changed dramatically. as emphasized repeatedly, if we examine a string with
the precision available currently and for the foreseeable future, it looks like a point particle. we can
make  this  informal  remark  precise:  when  studying  low-energy  processes  in  string  theory—those
processes that do not have enough energy to probe the ultramicroscopic, extended nature of the string
—we can approximate a string by a structureless point particle, using the framework of point-partic

e know that the extended nature of the string is crucial to its ability to
resolve the conflicts between general relativity and quantum mechanics that a point-particle theory
cannot. but at low enough energies—large enough distances—these problems are not encountered,
and such an approximation is often made for the sake of calculational convenience.

the  quantum  field  theory  that  most  closely  approximates  string  theory  in  this  manner  is  none
other  than  ten-dimensional  supergravity.  the  special  properties  of  ten-dimensional  supergravity
discovered  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  are  now  understood  to  be  low-energy  relics  of  the  underlying
power of string theory. researchers studying ten-dimensional supergravity had uncovered the tip of a
very  deep  iceberg—the  rich  structure  of  superstring  theory.  in  fact,  it  turns  out  that  there  are  four
different  ten-dimensional  supergravity  theories  that  differ  in  details  regarding  the  precise  wa

y  in
which  supersymmetry  is  incorporated.  three  of  these  turn  out  to  be  the  low-energy  point-particle
approximations to the type iia string, the type iib string, and the heterotic-e string. the fourth gives
the the low-energy point-particle approximation to both the type i string and the heterotic-o string;
in retrospect, this was the first indication of the close connection between these two string theories.

this is a very tidy story except that eleven-dimensional supergravity seems to have been left out
in  the  cold.  string  theory,  formulated  in  ten  dimensions,  appears  to  have  no  room  for  an  eleven-
dimensional theory. for a number of years, the general view held by most but not all string theorists
was that eleven-dimensional supergravity was a mathematical oddity without any connection to the
physics of string theory.12

glimmers of m-theory

the view now is very different. at strings '95, witten argued that if we start with the type iia string
and

increase its coupling constant from a value much less than 1 to a value much greater than 1, the
physics we are still able to analyze (essentially that of the bps saturated configurations) has a low-
energy approximation that is eleven-dimensional supergravity.

when witten announced this discovery, it stunned the audience and it has since rocked the string
theory community. for almost everyone in the field, it was a completely unexpected development.
your first reaction to this result may echo that of most experts in the field: how can a theory specific
to eleven dimensions be relevant to a different theory in ten?

the  answer  is  of  deep  significance.  to  understand  it,  we  must  describe  witten's  result  more
precisely. actually, it's eas

.  nevertheless,  witten's  arguments  and  those  of  other  physicists  during  the  second
superstring  revolution  do  give  strong  evidence  that  the  type  iia  and  heterotic-e  "strings"  are,
fundamentally, two-dimensional membranes living in an eleven-dimensional universe.

but  what is  this  eleven-dimensional  theory?  at  low  energies  (low  compared  to  the  planck

energy),  witten  and  others  argued,  it  is  approximated  by  the  long-neglected  eleven-dimensional
supergravity quantum field theory. but for higher energies, how can we describe this theory? this
topic  is  currently  under  intense  scrutiny.  we  know  from  figures  12.7  and  12.8  that  the  eleven-
dimensional theory contains two-dimensional extended objects—two-dimensional membranes. and
as we shall soon discuss, extended objects of other dimensions play an important role as well. but

geometric parameters, we can pass from any one theory to any other, so long as we also include the
unifying central region of m-theory; this is shown in figure 12.2. even though we have only a scant
understanding of m-theory, these indirect arguments lend strong support to the claim that it provides a
unifying substrate for our five naively distinct string theories. moreover, we have learned that m-
theory is closely related to yet a sixth theory—eleven-dimensional supergravity—and this is recorded
in figure 12.11, a more precise version of figure 12.2.13

figure  12.11  illustrates  that  the  fundamental  ideas  and  equations  of  m-theory,  although  only
partially understood at the moment, unify those of all of the formulations of string theory. m-theory is
the  theoretical  elephant  that  has  opened  the  eyes  of  string  theorists  to  a  far  grander  unifying
framework.

theory could similarly be molded together to yield particular black holes.

in  actuality,  black  holes  are  one  possible  end  product  of  stellar  evolution.  after  a  star  has
burned all its nuclear fuel through billions of years of atomic fusion, it no longer has the strength—the
outward-directed  pressure—to  withstand  the  enormous  inward  force  of  gravity.  under  a  broad
spectrum  of  conditions,  this  results  in  a  cataclysmic  implosion  of  the  star's  enormous  mass;  it
violently collapses under its own tremendous weight, forming a black hole. contrary to this realistic
means of formation, strominger and vafa advocated "designer" black holes. they turned the tables on
black  hole  formation  by  showing  how  they  could  be  systematically  constructed—in  a  theorist's
imagination—by carefully, slowly, and meticulously weaving t

astounding  thing  is  that  humanity  has  now  come  to  a  point  where  a  framework  is  emerging  for
answering some of these questions scientifically.

the currently accepted scientific theory of creation declares that the universe experienced the
most  extreme  of  conditions—enormous  energy,  temperature,  and  density—during  its  earliest
moments. these conditions, as is by now familiar, require that both quantum mechanics and gravity be
taken into account, and hence the birth of the universe provides a profound arena for exercising the
insights  of  superstring  theory.  we  will  discuss  these  nascent  insights  shortly,  but  first,  we  briefly
recount the pre–string theory cosmological story, which is often referred to as the standard model of
cosmology.

we have seen from other viewpoints in earlier chapters, point-particle quantum field theory works
until typical particle energies are around the planck energy. in a cosmological context, this occurred
when the whole of the known universe fit within a planck-sized nugget, yielding a density so great that
it strains one's ability to find a fitting metaphor or an enlightening analogy: the density of the universe
at  the  planck  time  was  simply colossal.  at  such  energies  and  densities  gravity  and  quantum
mechanics can no longer be treated as two separate entities as they are in point-particle quantum field
theory. instead, the central message of this book is that at and beyond these enormous energies we
must  invoke  string  theory.  in  temporal  terms,  we  encounter  these  energies  and  densities  when  we
probe  earlier  than  the  planck  time  of  10-43  seconds  atb,  and  hence  this  earliest  epoch  is  the
cosmological arena of string theory.

fact, that there is not enough time for any physical influence to have traveled from one region to the
other. the difficulty, therefore, is that as we run the cosmological film backward and approach the
big bang, the universe does not shrink at a fast enough rate.

well,  that's  the  rough  idea,  but  it's  worthwhile  sharpening  the  description  a  bit.  the  horizon
problem stems from the fact that like a ball tossed upward, the dragging pull of gravity causes the
expansion rate of the universe to slow down. this means that, for example, to halve the separation
between  two  locations  in  the  cosmos  we  must  run  the  film  back  more  than  halfway  toward  its
beginning. in turn, we see that to halve the separation we must more than halve the time since the big
bang. less time since the bang—proportionally speaking—means it is harder for the two regions to
communicate, even though they get closer.

far right-hand side of the time line in figure 14.1—depends upon the fundamental laws of physics, to
be sure, but it may also depend on aspects of cosmological evolution, from the far left-hand side of
the time line, that potentially lie outside the scope of even the deepest theory.

it's not hard to imagine how this might be. think of what happens, for example, when you toss a
ball in the air. the laws of gravity govern the ball's subsequent motion, but we can't predict where the
ball will land exclusively from those laws. we must also know the velocity of the ball—its speed and
direction—as  it  left  your  hand.  that  is,  we  must  know  the initial  conditions  of  the  ball's  motion.
similarly, there are features of the universe that also have a historical contingency—the reason why a
star  formed  here  or  a  planet  there  depends  upon  a  complicated  chain  of  events  that,  at  leas

left for us throughout the universe, for our experimental data. with luck and perseverance, we may
finally be able to answer questions such as how the universe began, and why it has evolved to the
form we behold in the heavens and on earth. there is, of course, much uncharted territory between
where we are and where full answers to these fundamental questions lie. but the development of a
quantum theory of gravity through superstring theory lends credence to the hope that we now possess
theoretical tools for pushing into the vast regions of the unknown, and, no doubt after many a struggle,
possibly emerging with answers to some of the deepest questions ever posed.

principle—the  extension  of  the  principle  of  relativity  to  embrace  all  possible  vantage  points
regardless  of  the  complexity  of  their  states  of  motion. and  the  strong,  weak,  and  electromagnetic
forces are based on the more abstract gauge symmetry principles.

physicists, as we have discussed, tend to elevate symmetry principles to a place of prominence
by putting them squarely on the pedestal of explanation. gravity, in this view, exists in order that all
possible observational vantage points are on completely equal footing—i.e., so that the equivalence
principle  holds.  similarly,  the  nongravitational  forces exist  in  order  that  nature  respect  their
associated  gauge  symmetries.  of  course,  this  approach  shifts  the  question  of  why  a  certain  force
exists to why nature respects its associated symmetry principle. but this certainly feels like progress,
especially  when  the  symmetry

in  question  is  one  that  seems  eminently  natural.  for  example,  why
should  one  observer's  frame  of  reference  be  treated  differently  from  another's?  it  seems  far  more
natural  for  the  laws  of  the  universe  to  treat  all  observational  vantage  points  equally;  this  is
accomplished through the equivalence principle and the introduction of gravity into the structure of
the cosmos. although it requires some mathematical background to appreciate fully, as we indicated
in  chapter  5,  there  is  a  similar  rationale  behind  the  gauge  symmetries  underlying  the  three
nongravitational forces.

string theory takes us down another notch on the scale of explanatory depth because all of these
symmetry  principles,  as  well  as  another—supersymmetry—emerge  from  its  structure.  in  fact,  had
history followed a different course—an

d had physicists come upon string theory some hundred years
earlier—we can imagine that these symmetry principles would have all been discovered by studying
its properties. but bear in mind that whereas the equivalence principle gives us some understanding
of why gravity exists, and the gauge symmetries give us some sense of why the nongravitational forces
exist, in the context of string theory these symmetries are consequences; although their importance is
in no way diminished, they are part of the end product of a much larger theoretical structure.

this  discussion  brings  the  following  question  into  sharp  relief:  is  string  theory  itself  an
inevitable  consequence  of  some  broader  principle—possibly  but  not  necessarily  a  symmetry

 of  space  and  of
spacetime.  in  chapter  2  we  described  einstein's  realization  that  space  and  time  are  inextricably
interwoven  by  the  unexpected  fact  that  an  object's  motion  through  space  has  an  influence  on  its
passage  through  time.  in  chapter  3,  we  deepened  our  understanding  of  spacetime's  role  in  the
unfolding  of  the  cosmos  through  general  relativity,  which  shows  that  the  detailed  shape  of  the
spacetime fabric communicates the force of gravity from one place to another. the violent quantum
undulations in the microscopic structure of the fabric, as discussed in chapters 4 and 5, established
the need for a new theory, leading us to string theory. and finally, in a number of the chapters that
followed, we have seen that string theory proclaims that the universe has many more dimensions than
we  are  aware  of,  some  of  which  are  curled  up  into  tiny  but  complicated  shapes  that  can  undergo
wondrous transformations in which th

equations of the theory. but this is somewhat like assessing an artist's creative talent by requiring that
she work from a paint-by-number kit. she will, undoubtedly, add a personal flair here or there, but by
so tightly constraining the format of her work, we are blinding ourselves to all but a slender view of
her  abilities.  similarly,  since  the  triumph  of  string  theory  is  its  natural  incorporation  of  quantum
mechanics and gravity, and since gravity is bound up with the form of space and time, we should not
constrain the theory by forcing it to operate within an already existing spacetime framework. rather,
just as we should allow our artist to work from a blank canvas, we should allow string theory to
create its own spacetime arena by starting in a spaceless and timeless configuration.

the hope is that from this blank slate starting point—possibly in an era that existed before the

quantum mechanics which will resolve many of its puzzles is just around the corner. i think many
share the view that the recently uncovered dualities point toward a new, more geometrical framework
for  quantum  mechanics,  in  which  space,  time,  and  quantum  properties  will  be  inseparably  joined
together."5 and according to edward witten, "i believe the logical status of quantum mechanics is
going to change in a manner that is similar to the way that the logical status of gravity changed when

einstein  discovered  the  equivalence  principle.  this  process  is  far  from  complete  with  quantum
mechanics, but i think that people will one day look back on our epoch as the period when it began."6
with guarded optimism, we can envision that a reframing of the principles of quantum mechanics
within string theory may yield a more powerful formalism that is capable of giving us an answer to
the question of how the universe began and why there are such things as space and

can string theory be experimentally tested?

among  the  many  features  of  string  theory  that  we  have  discussed  in  the  preceding  chapters,  the
following three are perhaps the most important ones to keep firmly in mind. first, gravity and quantum
mechanics are part and parcel of how the universe works and therefore any purported unified theory
must incorporate both. string theory accomplishes this. second, studies by physicists over the past
century  have  revealed  that  there  are  other  key  ideas—many  of  which  have  been  experimentally
confirmed—that appear central to our understanding of the universe. these include the concepts of
spin, the family structure of matter particles, messenger particles, gauge symmet

and  the  challenges  these  developments  pose  to  our  previous  way  of  seeing  the  world  are
monumental: loops of strings and oscillating globules, uniting all of creation into vibrational patterns
that are meticulously executed in a universe with numerous hidden dimensions capable of undergoing
extreme contortions in which their spatial fabric tears apart and then repairs itself. who could have
guessed that the merging of gravity and quantum mechanics into a unified theory of all matter and all
forces would yield such a revolution in our understanding of how the universe works?

no  doubt,  there  are  even  grander  surprises  in  store  for  us  as  we  continue  to  seek  a  full  and
calculationally tractable understanding of superstring theory. already, through studies in m-theory,
we have seen glimpses of a strange new domain of the universe lurking beneath the planck length,

e multiverse. these ideas are at the current edge of speculation, but
they may presage the next leap in our understanding of the universe.

as we fix our sight on the future and anticipate all the wonders yet in store for us, we should
also reflect back and marvel at the journey we have taken so far. the search for the fundamental laws
of the universe is a distinctly human drama, one that has stretched the mind and enriched the spirit.
einstein's vivid description of his own quest to understand gravity—"the years of anxious searching
in  the  dark,  with  their  intense  longing,  their  alternations  of  confidence  and  exhaustion,  and  final

emergence into the light"8—encompasses, surely, the whole human struggle. we are all, each in our
own way, seekers of the truth and we each long for an answer to why we are here. as we collectively

chapter 2

1.  the  presence  of  massive  bodies  like  the  earth  does  complicate  matters  by  introducing
gravitational  forces.  since  we  are  now  focusing  on  motion  in  the  horizontal  direction—not  the
vertical direction—we can and will ignore the earth's presence. in the next chapter we will undertake
a thorough discussion of gravity.

2. more precisely, the speed of light through the vacuum of empty space is 670 million miles
per hour. when light travels through a substance such as air or glass its speed is decreased in roughly
the same way that a rock dropped from a cliff is dragged to a slower speed when it enters a body of
water.  this  slowing  of  light  relative  to  its  speed  through  a  vacuum  is  of  no  consequence  for  our
discussion of relativity and is justifiably ignored throughout the text.

atomic clock accurate to about a trillionth of a second per hour. they hoped to show that as the rocket
gained altitude (thereby decreasing the effect of the earth's gravitational pull), an identical earthbound
atomic clock (still subject to the full force of the earth's gravity) would tick more slowly. through a
two-way stream of microwave signals, the researchers were able to compare the rate of ticking of the
two atomic clocks and, indeed, at the rocket's maximum altitude of 6,000 miles, its atomic clock ran
fast  by  about  4  parts  per  billion  relative  to  its  counterpart  on  earth,  agreeing  with  theoretical
predictions to better than a hundredth of a percent.

esses occur, you will know that you are watching a mirror-reflected image of the experiment, as
opposed to the experiment itself. since mirrors interchange left and right, the work of lee, yang, and
wu established that the universe is not perfectly left-right symmetric—in the language of the field, the
universe  is chiral.  it  is  this  feature  of  the  standard  model  (the  weak  force,  in  particular)  that
physicists found nearly impossible to incorporate into a higher-dimensional supergravity framework.

particular form for the spacetime geometry—but within our current theoretical understanding, we do
not know how to accomplish this. and so, to understand the theory better string theorists study its
properties as the values of these parameters are varied over all possibilities. if the parameter values
are chosen to lie in any of the six peninsular regions of figure 12.11, the theory has the properties
inherent to one of the five string theories, or to eleven-dimensional supergravity, as marked. if the
parameter  values  are  chosen  to  lie  in  the  central  region,  the  physics  is  governed  by  the  still
mysterious m-theory.

14. we should note, though, that even in the peninsular regions there are some exotic ways in
which branes can have an effect on familiar physics. for example, it has been suggested that our three
extended spatial dimensions might themselves be a three-brane that is large and unfurled. if so, as we
