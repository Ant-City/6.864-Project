name of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days i was able to call
for whatever i had a mind to.  she was very good-natured, and not above
forty feet high, being little for her age.  she gave me the name of
_grildrig_, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole kingdom.
the word imports what the latins call _nanunculus_, the italians
_homunceletino_, and the english _mannikin_.  to her i chiefly owe my
preservation in that country: we never parted while i was there; i called
her my _glumdalclitch_, or little nurse; and should be guilty of great
ingratitude, if i omitted this honourable mention of her care and
affection towards me, which i heartily wish it lay in my power to requite
as she deserves, instead of being the innocent, but unhappy instrument of
her disgrace, as i have too much reason to fear.

it now began to be known and talked of in the neighbourhood, that my
master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a

countenance.  he had the character of a great miser; and, to my
misfortune, he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master,
to show me as a sight upon a market-day in the next town, which was half
an hour‚Äôs riding, about two-and-twenty miles from our house.  i guessed
there was some mischief when i observed my master and his friend
whispering together, sometimes pointing at me; and my fears made me fancy
that i overheard and understood some of their words.  but the next
morning glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which
she had cunningly picked out from her mother.  the poor girl laid me on
her bosom, and fell a weeping with shame and grief.  she apprehended some
mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me
to death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands.  she had
also observed how modest i was in my nature, how nicely i regarded my
honour, and what an indignity i should conceive it, to be exposed for
money as a public

master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to
see me.  i walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me
questions, as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached,
and i answered them as loud as i could.  i turned about several times to
the company, paid my humble respects, said _they were welcome_, and used
some other speeches i had been taught.  i took up a thimble filled with
liquor, which glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their
health, i drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the manner of
fencers in england.  my nurse gave me a part of a straw, which i
exercised as a pike, having learnt the art in my youth.  i was that day
shown to twelve sets of company, and as often forced to act over again
the same fopperies, till i was half dead with weariness and vexation; for
those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that the people were
ready to break down the doors to

town.

my master, finding how profitable i was likely to be, resolved to carry
me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom.  having therefore
provided himself with all things necessary for a long journey, and
settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the 17th
of august, 1703, about two months after my arrival, we set out for the
metropolis, situate near the middle of that empire, and about three
thousand miles distance from our house.  my master made his daughter
glumdalclitch ride behind him.  she carried me on her lap, in a box tied
about her waist.  the girl had lined it on all sides with the softest
cloth she could get, well quilted underneath, furnished it with her
baby‚Äôs bed, provided me with linen and other necessaries, and made
everything as convenient as she could.  we had no other company but a boy
of the house, who rode after us with the luggage.

my master‚Äôs design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to
step out of the road for fifty or a

hundred miles, to any village, or
person of quality‚Äôs house, where he might expect custom.  we made easy
journeys, of not above seven or eight score miles a-day; for
glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with the
trotting of the horse.  she often took me out of my box, at my own
desire, to give me air, and show me the country, but always held me fast
by a leading-string.  we passed over five or six rivers, many degrees
broader and deeper than the nile or the ganges: and there was hardly a
rivulet so small as the thames at london-bridge.  we were ten weeks in
our journey, and i was shown in eighteen large towns, besides many
villages, and private

and four hundred feet wide.  he provided a table sixty feet in diameter,
upon which i was to act my part, and pallisadoed it round three feet from
the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling over.  i was shown ten
times a-day, to the wonder and satisfaction of all people.  i could now
speak the language tolerably well, and perfectly understood every word,
that was spoken to me.  besides, i had learnt their alphabet, and could
make a shift to explain a sentence here and there; for glumdalclitch had
been my instructor while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our
journey.  she carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a
sanson‚Äôs atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls,
giving a short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my
letters, and interpreted the words.

not live a month, was ready enough to part
with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold, which were ordered him
on the spot, each piece being about the bigness of eight hundred
moidores; but allowing for the proportion of all things between that
country and europe, and the high price of gold among them, was hardly so
great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in england.  i then said to
the queen, ‚Äúsince i was now her majesty‚Äôs most humble creature and
vassal, i must beg the favour, that glumdalclitch, who had always tended
me with so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might
be admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and
instructor.‚Äù

her majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer‚Äôs consent,
who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor
girl herself was not able to hide her joy.  my late master withdrew,
bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to
which i replied not a word, only makin

of so great and good an empress, the ornament of nature,
the darling of the world, the delight of her subjects, the phoenix of the
creation, so i hoped my late master‚Äôs apprehensions would appear to be
groundless; for i already found my spirits revive, by the influence of
her most august presence.‚Äù

this was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and
hesitation.  the latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar
to that people, whereof i learned some phrases from glumdalclitch, while
she was carrying me to court.

the queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, was,
however, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an
animal.  she took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was
then retired to his cabinet.  his majesty, a prince of much gravity and
austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view, asked the
queen after a cold manner ‚Äúhow long it was since she grew fond of a
_splacnuck_?‚Äù for such it s

eems he took me to be, as i lay upon my breast
in her majesty‚Äôs right hand.  but this princess, who has an infinite deal
of wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire, and
commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which i did in a
very few words: and glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door, and
could not endure i should be out of her sight, being admitted, confirmed
all that had passed from my arrival at her father‚Äôs house.

the king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions, had
been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly mathematics;
yet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk erect, before i
began to speak, conceived i might be a piece of clock-work (which is in
that country arrived to a very great

perfection) contrived by some
ingenious artist.  but when he heard my voice, and found what i delivered
to be regular and rational, he could not conceal his astonishment.  he
was by no means satisfied with the relation i gave him of the manner i
came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted between
glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me
sell at a better price.  upon this imagination, he put several other
questions to me, and still received rational answers: no otherwise
defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the
language, with some rustic phrases which i had learned at the farmer‚Äôs
house, and did not suit the polite style of a court.

his majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly
waiting, according to the custom

ntempt, saying, ‚Äúthat the farmer had
instructed me very well in my lesson.‚Äù  the king, who had a much better
understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by
good fortune was not yet gone out of town.  having therefore first
examined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young
girl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be
true. he desired the queen to order that a particular care should be
taken of me; and was of opinion that glumdalclitch should still continue
in her office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection
for each other.  a convenient apartment was provided for her at court:
she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a
maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but the
care of me was wholly appropriated to herself.  the queen commanded her
own cabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might serve me for a
bedchamber, after the model that glumdalclitch and i sho

uld agree upon.
this man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my direction, in
three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and
twelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two closets, like a london
bed-chamber.  the board, that made the ceiling, was to be lifted up and
down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty‚Äôs
upholsterer, which glumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it with
her own hands, and letting it down at night, locked up the roof over me.
a nice workman, who was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make
me two chairs, with backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory,
and two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.  the room was quilted
on all sides, as well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any
accident from the carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the
force of a jolt, when i went

 in a coach.  i desired a lock for my door,
to prevent rats and mice from coming in.  the smith, after several
attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for i have
known a larger at the gate of a gentleman‚Äôs house in england.  i made a
shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing glumdalclitch might
lose it.  the queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be
gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an english blanket,
very cumbersome till i was accustomed to them.  they were after the
fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the persian, and partly the
chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.

the queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without
me.  i had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at
her left elbow, and

a chair to sit on.  glumdalclitch stood on a stool on
the floor near my table, to assist and take care of me.  i had an entire
set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in
proportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than what i have
seen in a london toy-shop for the furniture of a baby-house: these my
little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as
i wanted them, always cleaning them herself.  no person dined with the
queen but the two princesses royal, the eldest sixteen

, which to me was for some time a very
nauseous sight.  she would craunch the wing of a lark, bones and all,
between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as that of a
full-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two
twelve-penny loaves.  she drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at
a draught.  her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon
the handle.  the spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the
same proportion.  i remember when glumdalclitch carried me, out of
curiosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of
those enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, i thought i had
never till then beheld so terrible a sight.

it is the custom, that every wednesday (which, as i have observed, is
their sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes,
dine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom i was now become a
great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were

one day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with
something i had said to him, that, raising himself upon the frame of her
majesty‚Äôs chair, he took me up by the middle, as i was sitting down, not
thinking any harm, and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream, and
then ran away as fast as he could.  i fell over head and ears, and, if i
had not been a good swimmer, it might have gone very hard with me; for
glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the
room, and the queen was in such a fright, that she wanted presence of
mind to assist me.  but my little nurse ran to my relief, and took me
out, after i had swallowed above a quart of cream.  i was put to bed:
however, i received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes,
which was utterly spoiled.  the dwarf was soundly whipt, and as a farther
punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown
me: neither wa

he had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,
although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have
immediately cashiered him, if i had not been so generous as to intercede.
her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and, after knocking
out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect, as it stood
before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while glumdalclitch was gone
to the side-board, mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me
at meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs together,
wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist, where i stuck for some
time, and made a very ridiculous figure.  i believe it was near a minute
before any one knew what was become of me; for i thought it below me to
cry out.  but, as princes seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not
scalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition.

ards upon a ceiling.  i had much ado
to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear
starting when they came on my face.  it was the common practice of the
dwarf, to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as schoolboys do
among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten
me, and divert the queen.  my remedy was to cut them in pieces with my
knife, as they flew in the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.

i remember, one morning, when glumdalclitch had set me in a box upon a
window, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for i durst not
venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window, as we do with
cages in england), after i had lifted up one of my sashes, and sat down
at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast, above twenty
wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room, humming louder
than the drones of as many bagpipes.  some of them seized my cake, and
carried it piecemeal away; others flew a

a half in breadth; as i
measured it myself in the royal map made by the king‚Äôs order, which was
laid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: i
paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and,
computing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.

the king‚Äôs palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about
seven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty
feet high, and broad and long in proportion.  a coach was allowed to
glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to
see the town, or go among the shops; and i was always of the party,
carried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often take
me out, and hold me in her hand, that i might more conveniently view the
houses and the people, as we passed along the streets.  i reckoned our
coach to be about a square of westminster-hall, but not altogether so
high: however, i cannot be very exact.  one day the governess ordered our
coachman to s

 swine.  they
were the first i had ever beheld, and i should have been curious enough
to dissect one of them, if i had had proper instruments, which i
unluckily left behind me in the ship, although, indeed, the sight was so
nauseous, that it perfectly turned my stomach.

besides the large box in which i was usually carried, the queen ordered a
smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten high,
for the convenience of travelling; because the other was somewhat too
large for glumdalclitch‚Äôs lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was made
by the same artist, whom i directed in the whole contrivance.  this
travelling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of
three of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on the
outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys.  on the fourth side,
which had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the
person that carried me, when i had a mind to be on horseback, put a
leathern belt, and buckled it a

bout his waist.  this was always the
office of some grave trusty servant, in whom i could confide, whether i
attended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see
the gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in
the court, when glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for i soon
began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, i suppose
more upon account of their majesties‚Äô favour, than any merit of my own.
in journeys, when i was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would
buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before him; and there i had
a full prospect of the country on three sides, from my three windows.  i
had, in this closet, a field-bed and a hammock, hung from the ceiling,
two chairs and a table, 
 
 ___________________________
 
neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being
tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach.  and having been
long used to sea-voyages, those motions, although sometimes very violent,
did not much discompose me.

whenever i had a mind to see the town, it was always in my
travelling-closet; which glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open
sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended
by two others in the queen‚Äôs livery.  the people, who had often heard of
me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was
complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand,
that i might be more conveniently seen.

i was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower
belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.
acc

, that whatever this famous tower wants in
height, is amply made up in beauty and strength: for the walls are near a
hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each is about forty feet
square, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors, cut
in marble, larger than the life, placed in their several niches.  i
measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues,
and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found it exactly four feet
and an inch in length.  glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief,
and carried it home in her pocket, to keep among other trinkets, of which
the girl was very fond, as children at her age usually are.

the king‚Äôs kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and about
six hundred feet high.  the great oven is not so wide, by ten paces, as
the cupola at st. paul‚Äôs: for i measured the latter on purpose, after my
return.  but if i should describe the kitchen grate, the prodigious pots
and kettles, the joints of meat tu

several adventurers that happened to the author.  the execution of a
criminal.  the author shows his skill in navigation.

i should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness had
not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents; some of
which i shall venture to relate.  glumdalclitch often carried me into the
gardens of the court in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me out
of it, and hold me in her hand, or set me down to walk.  i remember,
before the dwarf left the queen, he followed us one day into those
gardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and i being close together,
near some dwarf apple trees, i must needs show my wit, by a silly
allusion between him and the trees, which happens to hold in their
language as it does in ours.  whereupon, the malicious rogu

e, watching
his opportunity, when i was walking under one of them, shook it directly
over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of them near as large as a
bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; one of them hit me on the
back as i chanced to stoop, and knocked me down flat on my face; but i
received no other hurt, and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire, because
i had given the provocation.

another day, glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert
myself, while she walked at some distance with her governess.  in the
meantime, there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that i was
immediately by the force of it, struck to the ground: and when i was
down, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if i
had been pelted with tennis-balls; however, i made a shift to creep on
all fours, and shelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the lee-side
of a border of lemon-thyme, bu

o myself, and he carried me safe to my
little nurse, who, by this time, had returned to the place where she left
me, and was in cruel agonies when i did not appear, nor answer when she
called.  she severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog.
but the thing was hushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was
afraid of the queen‚Äôs anger; and truly, as to myself, i thought it would
not be for my reputation, that such a story should go about.

this accident absolutely determined glumdalclitch never to trust me
abroad for the future out of her sight.  i had been long afraid of this
resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky
adventures, that happened in those times when i was left by myself.  once
a kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if i had not
resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier, he would have
certainly carried me away in his talons.  another time, walking to the
top of a fresh mole-hill, i fell to my neck in the hol

h i happened to stumble
over, as i was walking alone and thinking on poor england.

i cannot tell whether i were more pleased or mortified to observe, in
those solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all
afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard‚Äôs distance, looking for
worms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if no
creature at all were near them.  i remember, a thrush had the confidence
to snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a of cake that glumdalclitch had
just given me for my breakfast.  when i attempted to catch any of these
birds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavouring to peck my
fingers, which i durst not venture within their reach; and then they
would hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or snails, as they did
before.  but one day, i took a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my
strength so luckily, at a linnet, that i knocked him down, and seizing
him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse.

been stunned, recovering himself gave me
so many boxes with his wings, on both sides of my head and body, though i
held him at arm‚Äôs-length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that i
was twenty times thinking to let him go.  but i was soon relieved by one
of our servants, who wrung off the bird‚Äôs neck, and i had him next day
for dinner, by the queen‚Äôs command.  this linnet, as near as i can
remember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an english swan.

the maids of honour often invited glumdalclitch to their apartments, and
desired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the
pleasure of seeing and touching me.  they would often strip me naked from
top to toe, and lay me at full length in their bosoms; wherewith i was
much disgusted because, to say the truth, a very offensive smell came
from their skins; which i do not mention, or intend, to the disadvantage
of those excellent ladies, for whom i have all manner of respect; but i
conceive that my sense was more acute in proport

portable,
than when they used perfumes, under which i immediately swooned away.  i
cannot forget, that an intimate friend of mine in lilliput, took the
freedom in a warm day, when i had used a good deal of exercise, to
complain of a strong smell about me, although i am as little faulty that
way, as most of my sex: but i suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice
with regard to me, as mine was to that of this people.  upon this point,
i cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress, and
glumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady
in england.

that which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my
nurse carried me to visit then) was, to see them use me without any
manner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of consequence: for
they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on their smocks in my
presence, while i was placed on their toilet, directly before their naked
bodies, which i am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight

 nothing farther
concerning the rest of their persons.  neither did they at all scruple,
while i was by, to discharge what they had drank, to the quantity of at
least two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tuns.  the
handsomest among these maids of honour, a pleasant, frolicsome girl of
sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples, with
many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over
particular.  but i was so much displeased, that i entreated glumdalclitch
to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more.

one day, a young gentleman, who was nephew to my nurse‚Äôs governess, came
and pressed them both to see an execution.  it was of a man, who had
murdered one of that gentleman‚Äôs intimate acquaintance.  glumdalclitch
was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against her inclination,
for she was naturally tender-hearted: and, as for myself, although i
abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity tempted me to see
some

half an hour.  here i often used to row for my own diversion, as well as
that of the queen and her ladies, who thought themselves well entertained
with my skill and agility.  sometimes i would put up my sail, and then my
business was only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their
fans; and, when they were weary, some of their pages would blow my sail
forward with their breath, while i showed my art by steering starboard or
larboard as i pleased.  when i had done, glumdalclitch always carried
back my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.

in this exercise i once met an accident, which had like to have cost me
my life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the
governess who attended glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to
place me in the boat: but i happened to slip through her fingers, and
should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the
luckiest chance in the world, i had not been stopped by a corking-

pin
that stuck in the good gentlewoman‚Äôs stomacher; the head of the pin
passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and thus i was
held by the middle in the air, till glumdalclitch ran to my relief.

another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough
every third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a huge frog
(not perceiving it) slip out of his pail.  the frog lay concealed till i
was put into my boat, but then, seeing a resting-place, climbed up, and
made it lean so much on one side, that i was forced to balance it with
all my weight on the other, to prevent overturning.  when the frog was
got in, it hopped at once half the length of the

head, backward and forward, daubing my face and clothes with its odious
slime.  the largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed
animal that can be conceived.  however, i desired glumdalclitch to let me
deal with it alone.  i banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and
at last forced it to leap out of the boat.

but the greatest danger i ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a
monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.  glumdalclitch
had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business,
or a visit.  the weather being very warm, the closet-window was left
open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which i
usually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency.  as i sat
quietly meditating at my table, i heard something bounce in at the
closet-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat,
although i was much alarmed, yet i ventured to look out, but not stirring
from my seat

ore prudent to submit.  i have good reason to believe,
that he took me for a young one of his own species, by his often stroking
my face very gently with his other paw.  in these diversions he was
interrupted by a noise at the closet door, as if somebody were opening
it: whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come
in, and thence upon the leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and
holding me in the fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to
ours.  i heard glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying
me out.  the poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace
was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen
by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding
me like a baby in one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by
cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on
one side of his chaps, and patting me when i would not eat; whereat many

mpt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among
those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him.  and
yet i have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in england
since my return; where a little contemptible varlet, without the least
title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look with
importance, and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the
kingdom.

i was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and
glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to
inform the queen, whenever i committed any folly that she thought would
be diverting to her majesty.  the girl, who had been out of order, was
carried by her governess to take the air about an hour‚Äôs distance, or
thirty miles from town.  they alighted out of the coach near a small
foot-path in a field, and glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box, i
went out of it to walk.  there was a cow-dung in the path, and i must

to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe.
his majesty, according to the custom of the country, was only shaved
twice a-week.  i once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds
or lather, out of which i picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps
of hair.  i then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it like the back of a
comb, making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a
needle as i could get from glumdalclitch.  i fixed in the stumps so
artificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points,
that i made a very tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own
being so much broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither
did i know any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would
undertake to make me another.

and this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein i spent many of my
leisure hours.  i desired the queen‚Äôs woman to save for me the combings
of her majesty‚

w them for curiosities, as indeed they were the wonder of every one
that beheld them.  the queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs,
but i absolutely refused to obey her, protesting i would rather die than
place a dishonourable part of my body on those precious hairs, that once
adorned her majesty‚Äôs head.  of these hairs (as i had always a mechanical
genius) i likewise made a neat little purse, about five feet long, with
her majesty‚Äôs name deciphered in gold letters, which i gave to
glumdalclitch, by the queen‚Äôs consent.  to say the truth, it was more for
show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger
coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that
girls are fond of.

the king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to
which i was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear them:
but the noise was so great that i could hardly distinguish the tunes.  i
am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army,

 beating and
sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it.  my practice was
to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat, as far as
i could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and draw the window
curtains; after which i found their music not disagreeable.

i had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.
glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a-week
to teach her: i called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that
instrument, and was played upon in the same manner.  a fancy came into my
head, that i would entertain the king and queen with an english tune upon
this instrument.  but this appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet
was near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide, so that with
my arms extended i could not reach to above five keys, and to press them

against criminals, their precedents are so few, that they have little
reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either.

they have had the art of printing, as well as the chinese, time out of
mind: but their libraries are not very large; for that of the king, which
is reckoned the largest, does not amount to above a thousand volumes,
placed in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long, whence i had liberty to
borrow what books i pleased.  the queen‚Äôs joiner had contrived in one of
glumdalclitch‚Äôs rooms, a kind of wooden machine five-and-twenty feet
high, formed like a standing ladder; the steps were each fifty feet long.
it was indeed a moveable pair of stairs, the lowest end placed at ten
feet distance from the wall of the chamber.  the book i had a mind to
read, was put up leaning against the wall: i first mounted to the upper
step of the ladder, and turning my face towards the book, began at the
top of the page, and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten
paces, accor

 turned over the leaf, which i could easily do
with both my hands, for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard, and in
the largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long.

their style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid; for they
avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using various
expressions.  i have perused many of their books, especially those in
history and morality.  among the rest, i was much diverted with a little
old treatise, which always lay in glumdalclitch‚Äôs bed chamber, and
belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in
writings of morality and devotion.  the book treats of the weakness of
human kind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the
vulgar.  however, i was curious to see what an author of that country
could say upon such a subject.  this writer went through all the usual
topics of european moralists, showing ‚Äúhow diminutive, contemptible, and
helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unab

of humankind.  i could never forget those domestic pledges i
had left behind me.  i wanted to be among people, with whom i could
converse upon even terms, and walk about the streets and fields without
being afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy.  but my
deliverance came sooner than i expected, and in a manner not very common;
the whole story and circumstances of which i shall faithfully relate.

i had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of the
third, glumdalclitch and i attended the king and queen, in a progress to
the south coast of the kingdom.  i was carried, as usual, in my
travelling-box, which as i have already described, was a very convenient
closet, of twelve feet wide.  and i had ordered a hammock to be fixed, by
silken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break the jolts, when a
servant carried me before him on horseback, as i sometimes desired; and
would often sleep in my hammock, while we were upon the road.  on the
roof of my closet, n

ot directly over the middle of the hammock, i ordered
the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square, to give me air in hot
weather, as i slept; which hole i shut at pleasure with a board that drew
backward and forward through a groove.

when we came to our journey‚Äôs end, the king thought proper to pass a few
days at a palace he has near flanflasnic, a city within eighteen english
miles of the seaside.  glumdalclitch and i were much fatigued: i had
gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to
her chamber.  i longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of
my escape, if ever it should happen.  i pretended to be worse than i
really was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a
page, whom i was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with
me.  i shall never forget with what unwillingness glumdalclitch
consented, nor the strict charge she gave the pa

ile it fell, and
hindered it from being broken on the surface of the water. every joint of
it was well grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down
like a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water came
in.  i got with much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured
to draw back the slip-board on the roof already mentioned, contrived on
purpose to let in air, for want of which i found myself almost stifled.

how often did i then wish myself with my dear glumdalclitch, from whom
one single hour had so far divided me!  and i may say with truth, that in
the midst of my own misfortunes i could not forbear lamenting my poor
nurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of the
queen, and the ruin of her fortune.  perhaps many travellers have not
been under greater difficulties and distress than i was at this juncture,
expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at least
overset by the first violent blast, or rising wave.  a breach i

england, i got it hollowed into a cup, and set in silver.  lastly, i
desired him to see the breeches i had then on, which were made of a
mouse‚Äôs skin.

i could force nothing on him but a footman‚Äôs tooth, which i observed him
to examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for it.  he
received it with abundance of thanks, more than such a trifle could
deserve.  it was drawn by an unskilful surgeon, in a mistake, from one of
glumdalclitch‚Äôs men, who was afflicted with the tooth-ache, but it was as
sound as any in his head.  i got it cleaned, and put it into my cabinet.
it was about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.

the captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation i had given
him, and said, ‚Äúhe hoped, when we returned to england, i would oblige the
world by putting it on paper, and making it public.‚Äù  my answer was,
‚Äúthat we were overstocked with books of travels: that nothing could now
pass which was
