â€œand a cockney, besides!â€ said lucy, who had been further saddened by
the signoraâ€™s unexpected accent. â€œit might be london.â€ she looked at the
two rows of english people who were sitting at the table; at the row
of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the
english people; at the portraits of the late queen and the late poet
laureate that hung behind the english people, heavily framed; at the
notice of the english church (rev. cuthbert eager, m. a. oxon.), that
was the only other decoration of the wall. â€œcharlotte, donâ€™t you feel,
too, that we might be in london? i can hardly believe that all kinds of
other things are just outside. i suppose it is oneâ€™s being so tired.â€

â€œthis meat has surely been used for soup,â€ said miss bartlett, laying
down her fork.

â€œi want so to see the arno. the rooms the signora promised us in her
letter would have looked over the arno. the signora had no business to
do it at all. o

â€œhe will not come back,â€ said george.

but mr. emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the
rev. cuthbert eager. lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear
the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old
man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. the son, who took every
little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.

the little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly. mr.
beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying:

â€œi consider that you are bound to class him as nice, miss alan, after
that business of the violets.â€

â€œviolets? oh, dear! who told you about the violets? how do things get
round? a pension is a bad place for gossips. no, i cannot forget how
they behaved at mr. eagerâ€™s lecture at santa croce. oh, poor miss
honeychurch! it really was too bad. no, i have quite changed. i do not
like the emersons. they are not nice.â€

mr. beebe smiled nonchalantly. he had made a gentle effort to introduce
the emersons into bertolini society, and the effort had failed. he was
almost the only person who remained friendly to them. miss lavish, who
represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the miss alans,
who stood for good breeding, were following her. miss

 continued miss bartlett slowly. â€œnone but the superficial would be
shocked at her. we had a long talk yesterday. she believes in justice
and truth and human interest. she told me also that she has a high
opinion of the destiny of woman--mr. eager! why, how nice! what a
pleasant surprise!â€

â€œah, not for me,â€ said the chaplain blandly, â€œfor i have been watching
you and miss honeychurch for quite a little time.â€

â€œwe were chatting to miss lavish.â€

his brow contracted.

there is a point on that road where we could get down and have an
hourâ€™s ramble on the hillside. the view thence of florence is most
beautiful--far better than the hackneyed view of fiesole. it is the view
that alessio baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures. that
man had a decided feeling for landscape. decidedly. but who looks at it
to-day? ah, the world is too much for us.â€

miss bartlett had not heard of alessio baldovinetti, but she knew
that mr. eager was no commonplace chaplain. he was a member of the
residential colony who had made florence their home. he knew the people
who never walked about with baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta
after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of,
and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them. living
in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in renaissance
villas on fiesoleâ€™s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and exchanged

at a renaissance villa? nothing had been said about it yet. but if it
did come to that--how lucy would enjoy it!

a few days ago and lucy would have felt the same. but the joys of life
were grouping themselves anew. a drive in the hills with mr. eager and
miss bartlett--even if culminating in a residential tea-party--was
no longer the greatest of them. she echoed the raptures of charlotte
somewhat faintly. only when she heard that mr. beebe was also coming did
her thanks become more sincere.

â€œso we shall be a partie carree,â€ said the chaplain. â€œin these days of

purity. andate via! andate presto, presto! ah, the town! beautiful as it

 to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola
there is something portentous in such desecration--portentous and
humiliating.â€

â€œhumiliating indeed,â€ said miss bartlett. â€œmiss honeychurch happened to
be passing through as it happened. she can hardly bear to speak of it.â€
 she glanced at lucy proudly.

â€œand how came we to have you here?â€ asked the chaplain paternally.

miss bartlettâ€™s recent liberalism oozed away at the question. â€œdo
not blame her, please, mr. eager. the fault is mine: i left her
unchaperoned.â€

â€œso you were here alone, miss honeychurch?â€ his voice suggested
sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing
details would not be unacceptable. his dark, handsome face drooped
mournfully towards her to catch her reply.

â€œpractically.â€

â€œone of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,â€ said miss
bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.

on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.â€

surely the vendor of photographs was in league with lucy--in the eternal
league of italy with youth. he had suddenly extended his book before
miss bartlett and mr. eager, binding their hands together by a long
glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.

â€œthis is too much!â€ cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of
fra angelicoâ€™s angels. she tore. a shrill cry rose from the vendor. the
book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.

â€œwillingly would i purchase--â€ began miss bartlett.

from the square.

, least of all when he has a
grievance. his mysterious persecution of mr. eager became relentless;
the air rang with his threats and lamentations. he appealed to lucy;
would not she intercede? he was poor--he sheltered a family--the tax on
bread. he waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied,
he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all
thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.

shopping was the topic that now ensued. under the chaplainâ€™s guidance
they selected many hideous presents and mementoes--florid little

psyche in alabaster; st. peter to match--all of which would have cost
less in london.

this successful morning left no pleasant impressions on lucy. she had
been a little frightened, both by miss lavish and by mr. eager, she knew
not why. and as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough, ceased
to respect them. she doubted that miss lavish was a great artist. she
doubted that mr. eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she
had been led to suppose. they were tried by some new test, and they were
found wanting. as for charlotte--as for charlotte she was exactly the
same. it might be possible to be nice to her; it was impossible to love
her.

fingering a model of the leaning tower of pisa.

success. the desire for education and for social advance--in these
things there is something not wholly vile. there are some working men
whom one would be very willing to see out here in florence--little as

does not get more than a snub.â€

â€œwhat?â€ cried lucy, flushing.

â€œexposure!â€ hissed mr. eager.

he tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had
interested his audience more than he had intended. miss bartlett was
full of very natural curiosity. lucy, though she wished never to see the
emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.

â€œdo you mean,â€ she asked, â€œthat he is an irreligious man? we know that
already.â€

penetration.

into the old chaotic methods. â€œtheyâ€™re nothing to me.â€

discomfited by the unpleasant scene. the shopman was possibly listening.

ify a rash remark. a silence followed which might have been
impressive, but was merely awkward. then miss bartlett hastily purchased
the leaning tower, and led the way into the street.

â€œi must be going,â€ said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.

miss bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of
the approaching drive.

â€œdrive? oh, is our drive to come off?â€

lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the
complacency of mr. eager was restored.

â€œbother the drive!â€ exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed. â€œit
is just the drive we had arranged with mr. beebe without any fuss at
all. why should he invite us in that absurd manner? we might as well
invite him. we are each paying for ourselves.â€

miss bartlett, who had intended to lament over the emersons, was
launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.

they were now in the newspaper-room at the english bank. lucy stood by
the central table, heedless of punch and the graphic, trying to answer,
or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain. the
well-known world had broken up, and there emerged florence, a magic
city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things. murder,

admirable delicacy â€œwhere things might lead to,â€ but apparently lost
sight of the goal as she approached it. now she was crouching in the
corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag
which hung in chaste concealment round her neck. she had been told that
this was the only safe way to carry money in italy; it must only
be broached within the walls of the english bank. as she groped she
murmured: â€œwhether it is mr. beebe who forgot to tell mr. eager, or mr.
eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave
eleanor out altogether--which they could scarcely do--but in any case
we must be prepared. it is you they really want; i am only asked for
appearances. you shall go with the two gentlemen, and i and eleanor will
follow behind. a one-horse carriage would do for us. yet how difficult
it is!â€

sympathetic.

miss bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:

â€œoh, you droll person! pray, what would become of your drive in the
hills?â€

they passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing
over the unpractical suggestion.



chapter vi: the reverend arthur beebe, the reverend cuthbert eager,
mr. emerson, mr. george emerson, miss eleanor lavish, miss charlotte
bartlett, and miss lucy honeychurch drive out in carriages to see a
view; italians drive them.

it was phaethon who drove them to fiesole that memorable day, a youth
all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his masterâ€™s horses up
the stony hill. mr. beebe recognized him at once. neither the ages of
faith nor the age of doubt had touched him; he was phaethon in tuscany

saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must guard
against imposition. but the ladies interceded, and when it had been made
clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was allowed to mount
beside the god.

phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling
himself to drive with his arm round her waist. she did not mind.

indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversat

other two occupants of the carriage were old mr. emerson and miss
lavish. for a dreadful thing had happened: mr. beebe, without consulting
mr. eager, had doubled the size of the party. and though miss bartlett
and miss lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit,
at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their
heads, and miss lavish got in with lucy, while miss bartlett, with
george emerson and mr. beebe, followed on behind.

them, and mr. beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts. but a shoddy
lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of
god--they should enter no villa at his introduction.

lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these
explosive ingredients, attentive to mr. eager, repressive towards miss
lavish, watchful of old mr. emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep, thanks
to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of spring. she looked on the
expedition as the work of fate. but for it she would have avoided george
emerson successfully. in an open manner he had shown that he wished to
continue their intimacy. she had refused, not because she disliked him,
but because she did not know what had happened, and suspected that he
did know. and this frightened her.

tream, in the
common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of
a look or word. this sense of wickedness had been slight at first. she
had nearly joined the party to the torre del gallo. but each time that
she avoided george it became more imperative that she should avoid
him again. and now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two
clergymen, did not suffer her to leave florence till she had made this
expedition with him through the hills.

meanwhile mr. eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was
over.

â€œso, miss honeychurch, you are travelling? as a student of art?â€

â€œoh, dear me, no--oh, no!â€

â€œperhaps as a student of human nature,â€ interposed miss lavish, â€œlike

â€œoh, indeed,â€ said mr. eager. â€œare you indeed? if you will not think me

â€œit does indeed!â€ cried miss lavish. â€œtell me, where do they place the
scene of that wonderful seventh day?â€

but mr. eager proceeded to tell miss honeychurch that on the right lived
mr. someone something, an american of the best type--so rare!--and that
the somebody elses were farther down the hill. â€œdoubtless you know

during this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each
other disgracefully. lucy had a spasm of envy. granted that they wished
to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so. they were
probably the only people enjoying the expedition. the carriage swept
with agonizing jolts up through the piazza of fiesole and into the
settignano road.

â€œpiano! piano!â€ said mr. eager, elegantly waving his hand over his head.

â€œva bene, signore, va bene, va bene,â€ crooned the driver, and whipped
his horses up again.

now mr. eager and miss lavish began to talk against each other on the
subject of alessio baldovinetti. was he a cause of the renaissance, or
was he one of its manifestations? the other carriage was left behind. as
the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of mr. emerson
was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine

an extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat. phaethon, who for some
time had been endeavouring to kiss persephone, had just succeeded.

a little scene ensued, which, as miss bartlett said afterwards, was
most unpleasant. the horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to
disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his pourboire, the girl was
immediately to get down.

â€œshe is my sister,â€ said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.

mr. eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.

phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but
at its manner. at this point mr. emerson, whom the shock of stopping
had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated, and
patted them on the back to signify his approval. and miss lavish, though
unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of bohemianism.

â€œmost certainly i would let them be,â€ she cried. â€œbut i dare say i

treating us as if we were a party of cookâ€™s tourists.â€

â€œsurely no!â€ said miss lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.

the other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible mr. beebe
called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave
themselves properly.

in no awe. â€œdo we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the

here the voice of miss bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun
to collect.

mr. eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a
resolute will, was determined to make himself heard. he addressed the
driver again. italian in the mouth of italians is a deep-voiced stream,
with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony.
in mr. eagerâ€™s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling
fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker,
and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a click.

for a moment the two girls looked at each other. then persephone got
down from the box.

â€œvictory at last!â€ said mr. eager, smiting his hands together as the
carriages started again.

â€œit is not victory,â€ said mr. emerson. â€œit is defeat. you have parted
two people who were happy.â€

mr. eager shut his eyes. he was obliged to sit next to mr. emerson, but
he would not speak to him. the old man was refreshed by sleep, and took
up the matter warmly. he commanded lucy to agree with him; he shouted
for support to his son.

business, possibly for the joy of ascending. standing there, he had seen
that view of the val dâ€™arno and distant florence, which he afterwards
had introduced not very effectively into his work. but where exactly had
he stood? that was the question which mr. eager hoped to solve now. and
miss lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical, had
become equally enthusiastic.

but it is not easy to carry the pictures of alessio baldovinetti in your
head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting. and
the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.

the party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to keep
together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions.
finally the

â€œiâ€™m sure itâ€™s all right,â€ put in lucy. â€œthe emersons wonâ€™t hear, and
they wouldnâ€™t mind if they did.â€

miss lavish did not seem pleased at this.

â€œmiss honeychurch listening!â€ she said rather crossly. â€œpouf! wouf! you
naughty girl! go away!â€

â€œoh, lucy, you ought to be with mr. eager, iâ€™m sure.â€

â€œi canâ€™t find them now, and i donâ€™t want to either.â€

â€œmr. eager will be offended. it is your party.â€

â€œplease, iâ€™d rather stop here with you.â€

â€œno, i agree,â€ said miss lavish. â€œitâ€™s like a school feast; the boys
have got separated from the girls. miss lucy, you are to go. we wish to
converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.â€

the girl was stubborn. as her time at florence drew to its close she was
only at ease amongst those to who

ist. â€œhere we are, all settled delightfully. even if my
dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown. sit down, dear;
you are too unselfish; you donâ€™t assert yourself enough.â€ she cleared
her throat. â€œnow donâ€™t be alarmed; this isnâ€™t a cold. itâ€™s the tiniest
cough, and i have had it three days. itâ€™s nothing to do with sitting
here at all.â€

there was only one way of treating the situation. at the end of five
minutes lucy departed in search of mr. beebe and mr. eager, vanquished
by the mackintosh square.

she addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the
carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars. the miscreant, a bony
young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy
of a host and the assurance of a relative.

â€œdove?â€ said lucy, after much anxious thought.

his face lit up. of course he knew where. not so far either. his arm
swept three-fourths of the horizon. he should just think he did know
where. h

briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker. they
were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing round
them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless
pieces. he was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the pliant
boughs. she was rejoicing in her escape from dullness. not a step, not a
twig, was unimportant to her.

â€œwhat is that?â€

there was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them. the voice
of mr. eager? he shrugged his shoulders. an italianâ€™s ignorance is
sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge. she could not make him
understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen. the view was
forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other
hills.

â€œeccolo!â€ he exclaimed.

at the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of
the wood. light and beauty enveloped her. she had fallen on to a little
open terrace, which was covered with violets f

kissed her.

before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called,

who stood brown against the view.



chapter vii: they return

some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the
afternoon. what it was and exactly how the players had sided, lucy
was slow to discover. mr. eager had met them with a questioning eye.
charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk. mr. emerson, seeking
his son, was told whereabouts to find him. mr. beebe, who wore the
heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the
return home. there was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. pan
had been amongst them--not the great god pan, who has been buried these
two thousand years, but the little god pan, who presides over social
contretemps and unsuccessful picni

lettâ€™s opponents,
but infinitely the least dangerous. once back in the town, he and his
insight and his knowledge would trouble english ladies no more. of
course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the
bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it. but after all, what have
we to do with taverns? real menace belongs to the drawing-room. it
was of drawing-room people that miss bartlett thought as she journeyed
downwards towards the fading sun. lucy sat beside her; mr. eager sat
opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious. they spoke
of alessio baldovinetti.

rain and darkness came on together. the two ladies huddled together
under an inadequate parasol. there was a lightning flash, and miss
lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front. at the next
flash, lucy screamed also. mr. eager addressed her professionally:

â€œcourage, miss honeychurch, courage and faith. if i might say so, there
is something almost blasphemous in t

fer than if we were walking. courage--courage and faith.â€

under the rug, lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousinâ€™s hand. at
times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care
not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it
afterwards. miss bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles,
gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross
examination.

she renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into florence.

â€œmr. eager!â€ called mr. beebe. â€œwe want your assistance. will you
interpret for us?â€

â€œgeorge!â€ cried mr. emerson. â€œask your driver which way george went. the
boy may lose his way. he may be killed.â€

â€œgo, mr. eager,â€ said miss bartlett, â€œdonâ€™t ask our driver; our driver is
no help. go and support poor mr. beebe--, he is nearly demented.â€

â€œhe may be killed!â€ cried the old man. â€œhe may be killed!â€

riage. â€œin
the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.â€

â€œwhat does he know?â€ whispered lucy as soon as they were alone.
â€œcharlotte, how much does mr. eager know?â€

â€œnothing, dearest; he knows nothing. but--â€ she pointed at the
driver-â€œhe knows everything. dearest, had we better? shall i?â€ she took
out her purse. â€œit is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people.
he saw it all.â€ tapping phaethonâ€™s back with her guide-book, she said,
â€œsilenzio!â€ and offered him a franc.

â€œva bene,â€ he replied, and accepted it. as well this ending to his day
as any. but lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.

there was an

 love and sincerity,
which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult. they descended
from the carriages; they embraced each other. it was as joyful to be
forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them. for a moment they
realized vast possibilities of good.

the older people recovered quickly. in the very height of their emotion
they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike. miss lavish calculated that,
even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the
accident. mr. eager mumbled a temperate prayer. but the drivers, through
miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the dryads and the
saints, and lucy poured out hers to her cousin.

â€œcharlotte, dear charlotte, kiss me. kiss me again. only you can
understand me. you warned me to be careful. and i--i thought i was
developing.â€

â€œdo not cry, dearest. take your time.â€

â€œi have been obstinate and silly--worse than you know, far worse. once
by the river--oh, but he isnâ€™t killed--he wo

 was shaken by deep sighs, which
nothing could repress.

â€œi want to be truthful,â€ she whispered. â€œit is so hard to be absolutely
truthful.â€

â€œdonâ€™t be troubled, dearest. wait till you are calmer. we will talk it
over before bed-time in my room.â€

so they re-entered the city with hands clasped. it was a shock to the
girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others. the storm had ceased,
and mr. emerson was easier about his son. mr. beebe had regained good
humour, and mr. eager was already snubbing miss lavish. charlotte alone
she was sure of--charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and
love.

the luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long
evening. she thought not so much of what had happened as of how she
should describe it. all her sensations, her spasms of courage, her
moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be
carefully laid before her cousin. and together in divine confidence they
would disentangle a

â€œcome away from the window, dear,â€ said miss bartlett. â€œyou will be seen

lucy obeyed. she was in her cousinâ€™s power. she could not modulate out
the key of self-abasement in which she had started. neither of them
referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to george and
settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.

miss bartlett became plaintive.

â€œoh, for a real man! we are only two women, you and i. mr. beebe is
hopeless. there is mr. eager, but you do not trust him. oh, for your
brother! he is young, but i know that his sisterâ€™s insult would rouse
in him a very lion. thank god, chivalry is not yet dead. there are still
left some men who can reverence woman.â€

as she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and
ranged them upon the pin cushion. then she blew into her gloves and
said:

â€œit will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.â€

â€œwhat train?â€

â€œthe train to rome.â€

k enough to detect
what they meant. she missed cecilâ€™s epigram, but grasped the feeling
that prompted it.

â€œdonâ€™t you like mr. beebe?â€ she asked thoughtfully.

â€œi never said so!â€ he cried. â€œi consider him far above the average. i
only denied--â€ and he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was
brilliant.

â€œnow, a clergyman that i do hate,â€ said she wanting to say something
sympathetic, â€œa clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful
ones, is mr. eager, the english chaplain at florence. he was truly
insincere--not merely the manner unfortunate. he was a snob, and so
conceited, and he did say such unkind things.â€

â€œwhat sort of things?â€

â€œthere was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his
wife.â€

â€œperhaps he had.â€

â€œno!â€

â€œwhy â€˜noâ€™?â€

â€œhe was such a nice old man, iâ€™m sure.â€

cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.

â€œwell, i did try to sift the thing. mr. eager would nev

â€ said mrs. honeychurch absently.

â€œbut isnâ€™t it intolerable that a person whom weâ€™re told to imitate
should go round spreading slander? it was, i believe, chiefly owing to
him that the old man was dropped. people pretended he was vulgar, but he
certainly wasnâ€™t that.â€

â€œpoor old man! what was his name?â€

â€œharris,â€ said lucy glibly.

â€œletâ€™s hope that mrs. harris there warnâ€™t no sich person,â€ said her
mother.

cecil nodded intelligently.

â€œisnâ€™t mr. eager a parson of the cultured type?â€ he asked.

â€œi donâ€™t know. i hate him. iâ€™ve heard him lecture on giotto. i hate him.
nothing can hide a petty nature. i hate him.â€

â€œmy goodness gracious me, child!â€ said mrs. honeychurch. â€œyouâ€™ll blow
my head off! whatever is there to shout over? i forbid you and cecil to
hate any more clergymen.â€

he smiled. there was indeed something rather incongruous in lucyâ€™s moral
outburst over mr. eager. it was as if one should see the leona

arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his
manliness. for he believed that women revere men for their manliness.

they left the pool in silence, after this one salutation. he waited for
her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts. at
last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.

â€œemerson was the name, not harris.â€

â€œwhat name?â€

â€œthe old manâ€™s.â€

â€œwhat old man?â€

â€œthat old man i told you about. the one mr. eager was so unkind to.â€

he could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had
ever had.



chapter x: cecil as a humourist

the society out of which cecil proposed to rescue lucy was perhaps no
very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents
entitled her to. her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built
windy corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up,
and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living the

to entertain us.â€

â€œno--read away. i think nothingâ€™s funnier than to hear silly things read
out loud. if mr. emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.â€

this struck cecil as subtle, and pleased him. it put their visitor in
the position of a prig. somewhat mollified, he sat down again.

â€œmr. emerson, go and find tennis balls.â€ she opened the book. cecil
must have his reading and anything else that he liked. but her attention
wandered to georgeâ€™s mother, who--according to mr. eager--had been
murdered in the sight of god and--according to her son--had seen as far as
hindhead.

â€œam i really to go?â€ asked george.

â€œno, of course not really,â€ she answered.

â€œchapter two,â€ said cecil, yawning. â€œfind me chapter two, if it isnâ€™t
bothering you.â€

chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.

she thought she had gone mad.

â€œhere--hand me the book.â€

she heard her voice saying: â€œit isnâ€™t worth reading--itâ€™s too silly

e at the time--and
of course i want to see constantinople so particularly.â€

â€œyou mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel--â€

â€œyes, yes. i knew youâ€™d understand.â€

mr. beebe did not quite understand. why could not miss honeychurch
repose in the bosom of her family? cecil had evidently taken up the
dignified line, and was not going to annoy her. then it struck him that
her family itself might be annoying. he hinted this to her, and she
accepted the hint eagerly.

â€œyes, of course; to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea
and everything has calmed down.â€

â€œi am afraid it has been a bothersome business,â€ he said gently.

â€œno, not at all. cecil was very kind indeed; only--i had better tell
you the whole truth, since you have heard a little--it was that he is
so masterful. i found that he wouldnâ€™t let me go my own way. he would
improve me in places where i canâ€™t be improved. cecil wonâ€™t let a woman

 horrible--worst of all--worse than
death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted
your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in
again! a judgement! and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had
dropped water on him in church! is it possible, miss honeychurch? shall
we slip back into the darkness for ever?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ gasped lucy. â€œi donâ€™t understand this sort of thing. i
was not meant to understand it.â€

â€œbut mr. eager--he came when i was out, and acted according to his
principles. i donâ€™t blame him or any one... but by the time george
was well she was ill. he made her think about sin, and she went under
thinking about it.â€

it was thus that mr. emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of god.

â€œoh, how terrible!â€ said lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.

â€œhe was not baptized,â€ said the old man. â€œi did hold firm.â€ and he
looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if
