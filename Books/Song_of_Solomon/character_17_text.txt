milkman dead: an anti-classical hero
many scholars approaching toni morrison’s song of solomon (new york:
knopf, 1977) have tried to explain the novel in traditional mythological
terms. they place milkman’s birth in the company of those of moses, king
arthur, achilles, prometheus, and other legendary figures treated by lord
raglan in the hero and by joseph campbell in the hero with a thousand
faces.
1 when parallels to these leave off, they turn to heroic patterns derived
from classical greek and roman mythology in an effort to identify and
incorporate the various allusions morrison dr

 attraction for his wife has led to her pregnancy. to minimize

into the world with all the care of one of the wise men anticipating the birth
of christ.
the mythical connections continue in milkman’s adult life in the quest
he undertakes in search of gold. comparable to jason’s search for the golden
fleece, or to odysseus’s journey home, milkman’s travels eventually lead to his

salvation as well. helpers and hinderers on that journey are also comparable
to those peopling the myths of the world. the classical circe immediately
comes to mind in the episode where milkman meets a woman with the same
name, a strange being in an unkempt house full of dogs. and who can fail
to think of icarus throughout the book as morrison focuses upon milkman’s
desire to fly?
other critical mythology-seekers concentrate on smaller connections

lain the novel. morrison recognizes that the use of such stories to explain
african-american culture would amount to a grossly ineffective superimposition
of an alien world view on a culture that she has consistently shown
to be resistant to such externally imposed concepts. trying to explain milkman
dead solely in terms of greek myth is just as erroneous as trying to
explain the breedlove family in the bluest eye in terms of the tale of dick
and jane.3
there is undoubtedly mythology in song of solomon, but it does not
derive solely from outside the black community. morrison herself has said
of “the flying myth” in song of solomon: “if it means icarus to some readers,
fine; i want to take credit for that. but my meaning is specific: it is about
black people who could fly. that was always part of the folklore of my life;
flying was one of our gifts. i don’t care how silly it may seem. it is everywhere—people
used to talk about it, it’s in the spirituals and gospels.”4 those

itself wholly with greek myth.
song of solomon 7
the greek and roman world views are ones in which the dichotomies
between good and evil are usually fairly clearly delineated—odysseus is good;
the sirens are bad. jason finally merits our approval; medusa is expendable.
the fickleness in that world belongs more to the gods than to the characters
on earth who are acting out or against the wishes of the gods. characters who
earn our sympathy do so in unambiguous ways. we never stop to think that

s, or that circe may have her
reasons for turning men into swine. we are asked simply to see the world in
an either/or relationship to the events, issues, and characters presented.
such an approach to song of solomon is impossible. a complex world, the
one morrison has created draws upon a dualism as old as african-american
existence in the new world. that world view presupposes an intertwining of
the secular and sacred realms of existence. individuals who worked all week and
went to root doctors on saturday could just as easily shout in ecstasy through
calling upon the name of the lord on sunday. such a history sets the stage
for a dualistic world view, but it does not inform exactly the world morrison
has

 created. few characters in morrison’s novels are religious; in fact, those like
soaphead church in the bluest eye are parodies of religious fervor, and pauline
breedlove, though she clings to the church, worships a god more of her own
creation than one reflecting an absolute morality beyond herself. eva peace
and her daughters loved men, not god; indeed, eva sets herself up as a goddess.
only ruth in song of solomon practices conventional religion; then, she
perverts the very notion of christianity by worshipping her dead father.5
morality, then, or any code of ethics based on how other human beings
should be treated in song of solomon, does not grow from roots of christianity.
yet we can conclude that certain actions are right and others wrong. the
dualism develops when morrison continues to blur the line between one
person’s right and another persons wrong. she refuses to allow us to be comfortable

when milkman tires of her. yet it is milkman’s rather than hagar’s perspective
that morrison follows through most of the relationship. she forces us
to wait and wait through it, to consider hagar expendable even if we do not
consider milkman innocent. she urges us to accept the possibility that something
great is in the making and to tolerate milkman’s destructiveness until
he, like velma henry in toni cade bambara’s the salt eaters (1980), discovers
his mission on earth.
song of solomon 9
a spoiled brat, milkman becomes a trial to our sympathies during this
waiting process. why doesn’t this thirty-year-old man hurry up and find himself,
we ask, and quit being so inexcusably and repulsively childish? uneasiness
notwithstanding, we do sense that milkman has a special relationship
to pilate, and that is the direction from which the measure of tolerance we
feel for him comes. if milkman can be saved from his spiritual inertia and
his human detachment, then pilate is the course t

 strictures almost as tangible
as the house in which the dead family is trapped, and they ensure that milkman
can never achieve his potential as long as he is in the environment where
his mother can influence him. ruth’s brand of obsession, no matter its origins
or extenuating circumstances, can only mean closure and heaviness for milkman,
not freedom and flight. unable, however, to push milkman beyond her
influence willingly, ruth can only watch as he discovers pilate’s world. she 
song of solomon 11
has no ultimate redress against her role being usurped by pilate, the surrogate
mother, for milkman must escape the dead house, must go into that world,
if he is to grow.
pilate represents the secular side of the traditional dichotomy—nonconformity,
freedom to explore, ties to history that transcend written records, and
the extranatural quality that ruth’s limited imagination can barely glimpse.
her lack of a navel symbolizes her extranatural mothering role, as well as the

 she is closer to him than
milkman could ever be, and she is similarly closer to ruth than milkman is
to his mother. macon and pilate, and pilate and ruth, have shared traumas of
existence that make failures to socialize or petty squabbling inaccurate measures
of the depth of their relationships. milkman superficially chooses pilate’s
license and freedom over his father’s strictures without realizing that the two
are complementary, inseparably bound in their meaning for his destiny.
song of solomon 13
these specific lessons that milkman fails to learn are but the fractional representations
of the philosophy of wholeness that pilate practices. when milkman
goes into her home, he goes into a peaceful environment, one unmarred
by the shadowy figures of his sisters or the blistering hatred his parents have
for each other. he finds a soothing place, one in which nothing is required of
him, except perhaps that he give himself wholly to its influence. it is an oasis
in a world where the sands of

can also be viewed as an aborted attempt to find meaning in her existence;
unable to do so on southern or northern soil, she returns to her home in
the north, more out of resignation than accomplishment. in her first two
novels, therefore, morrison depicts no pattern of seeking that leads to contentment
for her characters. they are driven, disturbed, unsettled from the
beginnings to the ends of their journeys. with milkman dead in song of
solomon, morrison culminates her pattern of reversal and simultaneously
allows milkman to find meaning in a territory that her previous characters
have shunned or escaped.
few characters in african-american literature chart their courses from
north to south, for the myth informing their actions invariably pictured the
north as the freer place, where money was plentiful and liberty unchallenged.
so they usually went north, to that earthly land of milk and honey.17 in song

e forges out of it a blueprint
for knowing himself. by going against the traditional archetypal movement
and structuring a more personally rewarding one, milkman earns our
respect as he discovers his identity. though his journey may share certain
features with some of the mythological quests, it is nevertheless more distinctive
than imitative.
milkman’s major problem is that he has been too complacent in his
northern, middle-class existence, far removed from the stock of black people 
song of solomon 15
in the south who were tied to his ancestors who moved north. in order for
milkman to appreciate those roots, to become receptive to his past, he must
be stripped of external symbols of separation. his city ways and attitudes
have to change; morrison effects the change by showing their uselessness on
southern soil. milkman undergoes a devolution from which he can be reborn
as a sensitive human being. the stripping process begins with his arrival in
danville, pennsylvania, where he hopes to fi

of either” (266). his money highlights their poverty, and his easy survey of
their women threatens the fragile bonds they can still use to claim their
manhood. when he locks his car, in a town “where there couldn’t be more
than two keys twenty-five miles around,” they know he is like the white men
for whom they sit and hope for a day’s work: “they looked at his skin and
saw it was as black as theirs, but they knew he had the heart of the white 
song of solomon 17
men who came to pick them up in the trucks when they needed anonymous,
faceless laborers” (266).
a man whose mere presence calls into question their own claims to
manhood can only be tested in the same arena. milkman has the power, manner,
clothes, and money the black men identify with white men; therefore,
they focus their first test on his sexual capacity—is he as much a man in sexual
matters as the signs suggest, or can he be a “faggot”? if they can humiliate
him with insinuations

 homosexuality, and perhaps embarrass him or
drive him away, they can restore to themselves some of the lack of manhood
his presence makes them feel. the ritual of transference is old, though its
specific manifestations may be unique. if milkman leaves the scene, then the
men will feel justified in not helping or accepting him. if he can hold his own
and somehow survive their insults, then they will stop the ritual testing and
tolerate him, perhaps even accept him into the community.
the men in solomon’s general store begin their test with a verbal
assault, in the tradition of one of the oldest forms of contest within black
communities. rather than playing the dozens, which would reflect subtle, less
direct attacks, they confront milkman with insults aimed not at his mother
but specifically at him. from the assertion that “pricks is . . . wee, wee little”
in the north, they seek confirmation from milkman and move on to insults
about homosexuality and sexual perversion:

change on his part will bring him closer to them and, on theirs, will
encourage them to respect him at a mutual, horizontal level rather than a
hierarchical one. as dorothy h. lee comments, “the older men take over the
initiation rite from the youths. the names of the men—omar, king walker,
luther solomon, calvin breakstone, and a giant called small boy—seem to
indicate that milkman has entered the circle of village elders, of poets, kings,
and men of god.”18
the coon hunt tests milkman’s courage and endurance, simultaneously
forcing him to be dependent upon individuals he has scorned. their familiarity
with the territory, equipment, and procedures highlights milkman’s greenness.

in which he realizes that none of the things separating him from the men

there was nothing here to help him—not his money, his car, his

him. except for his broken watch, and his wallet with about two
hundred dollars, all he had started out with on his journey was

nize that his family history
is more important than any gold he could seek. his tests have taught him
that human beings are not to be dismissed or ill treated with impunity. as a
part of the tie that binds him to all living beings, especially people of african
descent, he can no longer use his money to separate himself from the sauls
of shalimar, or his city-slicker shoes to separate him from the calvins, or his
condescension from the sweets of the world. they all tie him to a communal 
song of solomon 21
and familial heritage that goes back to africa, and they represent, in their
various states of development, some portion of his grandfather’s journey from
virginia to pennsylvania. the first macon dead’s hope for better things drove
him from the stifling south, a hope shared by the people who are still living
there and being similarly stifled by poverty. and his travel on a wagon, so far
distant psychologically and economically from milkman dead, reflects the
very soil and work to which

the people of shalimar are rooted. milkman has
been shocked into the recognition that he will not be allowed to break the
circle of connectedness extending generations before his own existence.
his rediscovery of his humanity makes him sensitive enough to susan
byrd’s information to realize that the children in shalimar are singing about
his great-grandmother, ryna, and his great-grandfather, solomon. he deciphers
names and connects their songs to pilate’s blues song about sugarman.
the puzzle of family history becomes more engaging than searching for gold.

distortions, becomes all important to milkman. he understands that names

of flying away from his family.
throughout his life, milkman has been “leaving” his family—through
his disdain and hatred for his mother and father, through his condescension
toward his sisters, and through his now recognized mistreatment of hagar.
he has left a string of bodies like his great-grandfather left ryna and jake,
milkman’s grandfather. where the paths converge signals a new beginning
for milkman, but it may be an ambiguous one. the exhilaration he feels upon
learning that solomon could fly is matched by the tragic circumstances surrounding
that fantastic event. the celebration of flying simultaneously highlights
ryna’s insanity and the fatherlessness of solomon’s twenty-one sons.
happiness in the knowledge of flight leads to the enigma of unhappiness in
the consequences of the flight. flying, then, becomes a selfish celebration of
the freedom of an individual judged against the enslavement of twenty-two
people.23 the selfish path milkman has followed throughout his

when milkman arrives at the discovery of his great-grandfather’s flying
abilities, he has two options. he can continue the path of solomon (celebration
without commitment), or he can use the kinship as a sign to renew his
ties to his family. the journey cannot work for milkman unless some reversal
occurs; flight itself must be made secondary to commitment. if he merely celebrates
flight, then he runs the risk of separation and of continuing to follow
in his great-grandfather’s flight pattern. if he puts commitment first, then he

female sacrifices for male identity
the success of milkman’s journey depends in large part on the string of
female bodies, figuratively and literally, that he leaves along his path. the
women form a long line of mothering and nurturing that culminates in
milkman’s renewed sense of himself; they become sacrifices on the altar
of his possibilities. comparable to the blood sacrifices in sula, those in
song of solomon are striking in that female characters are consistently the
victims. that victimization begins with ruth, whose deviant actions to get
pregnant are not enough to save her future relationship with her husband
or her son. in order to give birth to milkman, ruth must forever give up
physical relations with macon. in order to keep milkman alive, she must
intensify her role as mother, only to relinquish it forever when he becomes
an adolescent.

for them as individuals who may wish to do something else with their lives.
when milkman knocks macon down for hitting ruth, and when he tells of
corinthians’s affair with porter, he is not doing so out of love for his mother
or his sister. as lena says of the fight with macon, milkman was not protecting
his mother: “you were taking over, letting us know you had the right to 
song of solomon 25
tell her and all of us what to do” (216). on the night of their conversation,
when she is thirty-one, milkman finds himself talking to a sister “to whom he
had not said more than four consecutive sentences since he was in the ninth
grade” (211).

ineffectual as the deweys. corinthians is unable to determine her destiny until

alue or respect her. in the absence of any sense of family or communal
commitment, milkman dismisses hagar as easily as he perhaps dispossesses
his father’s tenants.
macon dead has put milkman in training to be callous, and reba and
pilate have unconsciously assured hagar’s victimization:
neither pilate nor reba knew that hagar was not like them. not
strong enough, like pilate, nor simple enough, like reba, to make
up her life as they had. she needed what most colored girls needed: 
song of solomon 27
a chorus of mamas, grandmamas, aunts, cousins, sisters, neighbors,
sunday school teachers, best girl friends, and what all to give her
the strength life demanded of her—and the humor with which to
live it. (307)
without encouraging her to see some reality outside of milkman, some
reality outside of their taking care of her, she is destined to acquiesce in
her own destruction just as milkman is destined to execute that destruction.

comes too late to help hagar, but it serves its purpose in pushing milkman
toward maturity. the pattern is set in a way that milkman thrives in direct
proportion to hagar’s demise. as he learns more about his relationship to her
and the rest of his family, her physical essence decreases in value. for each
stage on the journey that brings enlightenment to milkman, that enlightenment
comes directly from hagar’s lifeline. when he discovers—in shalimar,
virginia, sitting in front of solomon’s general store—that the children are
singing about his great-grandfather, he moves into a realm of self-awareness
that makes it impossible for him to treat anyone else as he has treated hagar.
almost in keeping with that progression, hagar dies. another victim on his
search for self, she has helped milkman in substantial ways by being an outlet
for his negative emotions and a symbol around which he gathers his reflections.

several who save milkman’s life.28 hagar is one of them; she dies in order that
he might grow—and perhaps, too, because there is no realistic place for her.
even if milkman returns to the north, enlightened, with a proposal of marriage
to hagar, chances are they would not be able to execute that desire. also,
the extent of milkman’s transgressions warrants a more striking lesson than 
song of solomon 29
a mere forgiving and making up. hagar’s death points out the emotionally
destructive binge milkman has been on all his life. morrison does not spare
him from having to confront the trauma resulting from that crime.
hagar, another body milkman has left in his “flying” pursuit of his greatgrandfather,
is like ryna or one of the twenty-one children solomon left on
his flight to africa. like ryna, the desertion leads to insanity and death. but,
also like ryna, who lives on in the tales of

in all of these roles, she gives voice to the value of human connectedness. in
singing “o sugarman,” she serves as the herald for milkman’s birth. in singing
with reba and hagar, she articulates the pain macon feels and soothes
his wounds. in singing at hagar’s death, she voices the pain of loss in sound
rather than lyrics. and in singing the “song of solomon,” she places stress on
the intricate ties to african and black american history that unite all generations
of those scattered in the diaspora. in her voice is the blending of secular
and sacred traditions, natural and supernatural concerns.30
she values human relationships, but she recognizes human limitations.

even for an enlightened milkman, is difficult to acquiesce to. yet it is consistent
with pilate’s prediction about who would save milkman’s life, and it is
consistent with the traditional demise of the helper/guide once the initiate
has learned all the helper has to teach. milkman has definitely learned the
value of family and of human relationships, and he has learned that escape
from a situation does not lessen responsibility for it: he is as guilty for hagar’s
death as solomon has been for ryna’s insanity and for whatever happened to
his twenty-one sons. he can now effectively take his teacher’s place, become
the guru rather than the seeker after knowledge held by the guru.
such a refined interpretation, however, does not alter the evaluation that
pilate joins the other women in milkman’s life in being made a victim to
his health, to his growth into a positive sense of self. milkman’s inability to

community. morrison depicts milkman in mythic terms. not only does his
story follow a cohesive pattern of miraculous birth, youth/alienation, quest,
confrontation, and reintegration into community, but morrison also infuses
it with both western and african-american myths which blend together
the mundane with the magical and the factual with the fantastic. morrison

one aspect to morrison’s work which seems most apparent is the desire
to establish and maintain a black cultural heritage in the face of the homogenizing
effects of late capitalism. each of her novels pinpoints historical
moments of disruption and transformation in that heritage. both the bluest
eye and sula focus primarily on the 1940’s when heavy black migrations to
the cities precipitated black incorporation into modern american capitalism.
in song of solomon, this incorporation seems complete as the novel’s central

on the surface, however, both families remain split apart by their two
modes of self-awareness, and this point of divisiveness places milkman in
an alienated position of desire and vacillation. identity for pilate is found
in a connective energy, one that evokes a living heritage through story and
song. macon teaches his son that identity can only be found in the future,

isolation, and alienation become the impetus for his open motion
toward independence and eventually to collective engagement. any comparable
sensations send hagar “spinning into a bright blue place where the air [is]

a misdirected flight away from any self-identity or visioned responsibility to

the novel, she worries, as she lays dying, that, like pecola breedlove, she has
been unacceptable to milkman because she does not have the “‘penny-colored

they remain decentered, disengaged, and are even killed off in the text. no
matter how similar they appear, they lack milkman’s possibilities, they play
no central role, their dreams, if they have them at all, remain unfulfilled until
the male hero fulfills them. as simone de beauvoir says of women in her the
second sex, the women in song of solomon “still dream through the dreams of
men” (161). thus, morrison’s use of multiple, parallel perspectives does not
entirely resolve the male-centered mythic bias in the novel.
of course milkman does appear as a surrogate for others, including
women. he is portrayed as one who attempts to find a self and place within a
black cultural context, and in doing so, he can inspire and lead others. he can,
in short, become a model for others to emulate. but in spite of parallel perspectives

that her vision encompasses all that is good and right and true in human

from her people, for except for the relative bliss on the island,
every other resource was denied her: partnership in marriage,

women whispered and shoved their children behind them. (149)

repared for his personal rebirth in
danville, he is seriously ill-equipped for his encounter with the communal
primitivism of shalimar. here milkman enters a mystical, magical territory
fraught with both dangers and delights. because shalimar has no bus or train
depot, milkman buys a car, and on his way through the south, he is buoyed by
the “southern hospitality”: “ . . . the negroes were as pleasant, wide-spirited,
and self-contained as could be.” but when milkman finally happens upon
solomon’s general store his first meeting with the townsmen suggests that
his notions about the south have been, like all of his perceptions, naively and
compulsively formed.
in talking to them, milkman learns that guitar has unexpectedly arrived
in shalimar and has been looking for him. guitar’s presence fills milkman

milkman has entered into an almost primeval world, a world that is fast

alimar,
his new-found idealism appears secure, while at the same time he no longer
fears himself or the unknown. his mythic initiation and transformation coupled
with his fearlessly empathic appraisal of guitar implies that milkman is
now able to mediate between both myth and reality. as his initiation signifies,
it is the myth of brotherhood and belonging which ultimately springs from
and illuminates reality.
when milkman first arrived in shalimar, he had heard the children
singing the song of solomon, “that old blues song pilate sang all the time:
‘o sugarman don’t leave me here,’ except the children [sing] ‘solomon don’t
leave me here’” (303). the song is the clue to milkman’s family history, but
more significantly, it also becomes for him an affirmation for kinship and
community. as he more carefully listens to the song again, milkman is
finally able to piece together his genealogy. symbols of flying permeate the
children’s ritual while, as they sing, one child “turn
 
 ___________________________
 
[s] around like an airplane”
(267). and as they sing, milkman listens to them recount the flight
from slavery of his grandfather’s father, solomon or shalimar, back to the
freedom of his african homeland. the song is both a variant of the flying
african folktales and of the icarus tale. solomon literally flies off with
his infant son, jake, leaving behind his wife, ryna, and some twenty other
children. susan byrd, cousin to jake’s wife, sing, confirms to milkman the
magical tale behind the song:
“no, i mean flew. . . . he was flying. he flew. you know like a bird.
just stood up in the fields one day, ran up some hill, spun around a
couple of times, and was lifted up in the air.” (326)
but, as susan continues, solomon “‘brushed too close to a tree and the baby
slipped out of

his arms’” (327), so that jake, too, was left behind which signaled
the long rupture in his family’s history.
we have once again come full circle in the novel. from the beginning, all
images and scenes of flight have ended either in death, disillusion, or desertion.
robert smith, driven to madness and to an “artificial” flight, had wished 
song of solomon: reality and mythos within the community 55
to free himself from the death and distortion of the seven days. milkman’s
failed flight for gold violates the principle of responsibility to others, and is
especially destructive to hagar, who later dies alone and inconsolate. and
solomon’s flight, while freeing him to return to his homeland, results in
the abandonment of family and friends. these types of absolute freedoms
through flight are problematic because they involve the denial of persona

l
and social bonds.
but within these negative images of flight lies a significant contradiction.
the flights of smith, milkman, and solomon are not, like icarus’, the
result of hubris and the desire for an impossible kind of freedom. instead,
each character has “flown” to escape a particular brand of oppression and thus,
morrison has reconstructed the myth to reveal its inherent limitations within
black culture and has shown the essential conflict it presents for both individual
and community.
milkman’s flight has restored his sense of community because not only
does the myth open out his family’s history but, as he later

s never revealed to pilate. “sing,
sing” is not her father’s request to sing, but a call to his wife. “you just can’t
fly on off and leave a body” is not simply a moral precept, but her father’s
plea to bury his bones which she unknowingly has carried with her for all
these years.
but milkman is not at first given his opportunity. pilate breaks “a wet
green bottle over his head” (335) and locks him in her cellar. filled with exuberance,
milkman had come home with the vision of solomon as a hero and
model: “‘he didn’t need no airplane. he just took off; got fed up. all the way
up! no more cotton! no more bales! no more orders! no more shit! he flew, 
56 patrick bryce bjork
baby’” (332). milkman identifies with solomon which fuels his own desire for
personal identity and independence, for a freedom that transcends his own
blighted world. however, pilate’s interposition furthers the mythic contradiction
because she rightly blames milkman for hagar’s death; like so

had flown off and left a body.
in the cellar-cave, milkman begins to comprehend this contradiction,
and by doing so, he experiences a true metamorphosis and eventual reemergence
into his community. he makes the connection between his desertion
of hagar to solomon’s desertion of ryna and the twenty-one children, as he
wonders to himself, “who looked after those twenty children? jesus christ,
he left twenty-one children!” (336). milkman realizes that the locus for his
personal identity is inextricably linked to pilate’s principle of responsibility
to others. and thus, he learns that objectification and commodification of
people only serve to further his sense of distortion and alienation. when
milkman finally tells pilate of his discoveries, the t

of individual relationships which, in the end, he can only achieve
through personal heroism. in choosing to “ride” toward guitar, milkman
must take his ultimate risk which may very well end in his death, but as the

necessary dialectic between a communal spirit and a factional reality.

situated in a specific cultural moment, song of solomon, which was published
in 1977, highlights the search for african-american roots. if in

of shame and trauma in song of solomon as she explores the shame–pride
issues surrounding the construction of black masculinity and

him the “shit” not only of his family’s false class pride but also of inherited
familial and racial shame. before the middle-class, urban milkman can
attempt to “fly”—that is, feel healthy family and racial pride—he must learn
about the interrelated shame–pride sources of black masculinity through his
contact with the black underclass in his michigan hometown and in

african-american identity. yet even as song of solomon seemingly celebrates
milkman’s discovery of his african-american “roots” and his “authentic”
black identity, it also anticipates a complaint commonly lodged against black
identity politics: that the “idea of the black experience” covers up “the differences
of class and privilege” that divide african americans (dean 60–61).

like his aunt pilate or his poor southern relations whom he originally sees
through the lens of internalized racism as the shameful and inferior other. if
part of the novel’s agenda is to show how milkman dead is brought to a new
and healing sense of racial consciousness as a result of both his association
with the black underclass and his discovery of his family’s slavery and postslavery
“roots,” song of solomon also investigates the link between the shame
and trauma of racial oppression and black rage, primarily through the oppositional
character of guitar bains, a member of the black underclass who is a
militant black nationalist and political terrorist. and if the novel intends an
“optimistic” ending by depicting milkman’s moment of flight and racial pride,
it also undercuts that optimism by suggesting that his leap into the arms of
the waiting guitar is nihilistic and suicidal.

exposes what shame theorists have referred to as the “collective secret” of
pride and shame, the so-called master emotions which, although they serve as
continuous monitors of the state of the social bond in the daily lives of individuals,
have long been ignored in our culture (scheff, retzinger, ryan 180,
scheff, bloody revenge 39). the “primary social emotions,” pride and shame
“have a signal function with respect to the social bond,” writes thomas scheff.
for while “pride gener

ame in reciprocal fashion.” thus, “the search for shame is considerably
aided by our understanding of its relationship to pride, both the true healthy
pride which accompanies authentic success, and the false pride with which
we defend our (denied) fragility” (“shame/pride axis” 186, 204). the false
pride that manifests itself as “insolence and haughtiness,” as scheff similarly
observes, “may mask deep-seated feelings of inferiority, i.e., shame” (bloody
revenge 44).
in song of solomon, morrison illustrates that shame and pride are at
once social emotions, which act as shaping forces in the construction of social
and group identity, and intrapsychic phenomena. part of morrison’s cultural
project in song of solomon is to investigate the social and familial sources of
black shame and pride and to distinguish between healthy and false pride.
morrison also explores the issue of class status in the social construction
of black identities as she cross-questions the black bourgeoi

african-american manhood. examining the class divisions within the african-american
community, song of solomon focuses attention on intraracial
shaming—the contempt that some middle-class african americans, like
members of the dead family, feel for poor and lower-class blacks. song of solomon
also deals with the shame and pride issues surrounding skin color, the
internalized racism that affords light skin a greater social value than dark skin.
in deliberately setting out to confront the vexed issues surrounding color and
class, song of solomon exposes what has been called the “dirty little secret” and
“last taboo” of african-american culture, the existence of intraracial color
prejudice and discrimination—the so-called color complex—which continues
to be an “embarrassi

rding to bell hooks, “those black folks who came of
age before black power faced the implications of color caste either through
devaluation or overvaluation.” if being born light meant beginning life “with
an advantage recognized by everyone,” being born dark meant starting life
“handicapped, with a serious disadvantage.” the 1960s black liberation movement
challenged this notion with its empowering “call to see black as beautiful.”
but in the late 1970s, around the time song of solomon was published,
the “politics of racial assimilation,” which had always operated as a “backlash,”
not only began to undermine black self-determination but also led, in the
1980s and 1990s, to the “resurgence” of the color-caste hierarchy (outlaw
culture 174, 175, 178).
song of solomon acts out an important social mission as it deals with
issues that african americans find painful and embarrassing, such as the slavery

in concealing or minimizing the racial shame and trauma at its core by inviting
critical analysis of its textual patterns and its use of folkloric and mythic
sources. while song of solomon is mired in the excretory discourse of shame,
it also, as is characteristic of morrison’s fiction, counteracts shame through
its rich literary discourse. critic-readers thus tend to avoid or minimize the
narrative’s racist and counterracist rhetoric, including its use of the shaming
discourse of dirt and defilement, and discuss, instead, the importance of
names and naming in the novel, or morrison’s use of the monomyth of the
hero, or her adaptation of the flight motif and its link to bot

aptly described as a work in which readers “passively . . . absorb the apparently
disconnected information provided by the author” at the beginning and
then manage to put together the “puzzle” by the end of the novel (spallino
513), song of solomon, like the other works we have investigated, enacts the
concealments and hesitancies characteristic of shame and trauma discourse.
for as morrison repeatedly feeds her readers, in a piecemeal fashion, tantalizing
or horrific details that are gradually elaborated on and/or explained as
the narrative unfolds, she partially conceals—in layer after layer of interpretable
but disconnected details that must be reconnected by the reader—the
painful content of what she is describing. it is also tell

and defensively associating scenes of trauma with the uncanny and dislocated
world of folklore and magic, the narrative diverts reader attention away from
its horrific descriptions of violence. through its insistent mythologizing of
african-american roots, song of solomon effectively transforms the disgrace,
degradation, and stigma of slavery and racist oppression into racial pride and
the transcendence of suffering, which are represented in the originary figure
of solomon, the heroic flying african. yet the suicidal flights that begin and
end the novel point to the pessimism, even nihilism, at the heart of the narrative.

that critic-readers often tend to bypass song of solomon’s “tragic realism”
and concentrate, instead, on its “magical romance” (see brenkman 79–80)
points to the power of morrison’s richly complex literary discourse to mask
or divert attention away from the shame and trauma issues that impel the
narrative. morrison also uses dialogic, parodic discourse to partially shield
readers from the troubling subject matter of her novel, and indeed morrison
has described song of solomon as her “own giggle (in afro-american terms)

the water mark also is the “single flaw on the splendid wood,” and it becomes
“more pronounced” with the passage of time after it is exposed (11–12). a
signifier of the hidden stain on the family honor—the stain of blackness—the
water mark represents the family’s hidden racial shame. ruth’s obsession with
her stained table, then, signals her own status anxiety—her own internalization
of a deep sense of familial and racial shame.
as song of solomon, in an act of textual exposure, brings to light the family
pathology that lies behind ruth’s middle-class refinement and the dead
family’s bourgeois respectability, it risks being accused, like the bluest eye and
sula, of invoking the corrosive and shaming hegemonic constructions of the
black family—in this case the middle-class, not the lower-class, family—as
a “tangle of pathology.” while macon marries ruth to bolster his own class

a common shame scenario in its account of milkman’s childhood experience
of maternal rejection, depicted here in his inability to hold his mother’s gaze.
milkman’s sense that everybody is laughing at him and his mother conveys
not only the maternal transmission of shame but also the global nature of
shame: the shame-vulnerable individual’s feeling, in the moment of public
exposure and ridicule, that his secret shame is visible to all.
like sula, song of solomon focuses on the maternal transmission of shame
and it also is concerned with the dangers of excessive mothering. but whereas
in sula morrison centers her attention on the woman-centered world of the
black matriarchy, in song of solomon she is concerned—especially in her representation
of macon dead—with issues surrounding the black patriarchy.

solomon explores the black patriarchy through the figure of the “stern, greedy,
unloving” macon dead (234). a domestic tyrant who keeps his family “awkward
with fear,” macon actively shames his wife and daughters, first corinthians
and magdalene, who is called lena. he expresses his hatred for his
wife in every word he addresses to her and communicates his disappointment
in his daughters, thus “dulling their buttery complexions and choking the

“all that shit” (76) about finding ruth naked in bed with her dead father and
shamed when his father’s story leads to the recovery of his repressed memory
of being nursed by his mother until he was too old, milkman comes to feel
“like a garbage pail for the actions and hatreds of other people” (120). mired
in the “shit” of family shame, he is caught up in a shame-shame feeling trap.
with oppositional intent, song of solomon exposes the family secrets of
the bourgeois dead family, uncovering the shame behind the class elitism and
false pride of milkman’s parents. morrison’s narrative also deliberately contrasts
the false pride of macon dead with the natural dignity of macon’s sister,
pilate, who belongs to the black underclass. in its representation of pilate,
the narrative invokes and reverses the pride–shame oppositions associated
with class and race—those of high/low, clean/unclean, pure/polluted—as

ilate’s lack of a navel to make a covert
political statement by associating pilate’s birth trauma and maternal loss with
the black struggle for survival. macon recalls how pilate came “struggling out

of the womb” after their mother died, how she inched “headfirst out of a still,
silent, and indifferent cave of flesh, dragging her own cord and her own afterbirth
behind her” (27, 28). in describing pilate as self-born, song of solomon
constructs her as an honored american type—the self-created individual. yet
it also focuses on pilate’s rebellious shamelessness as it uses this character
to dialogically contest the black assimilationist and bourgeois ideology of
self-help and self-improvement. ignoring the pain and powerlessness of the
social outcast’s situation, the text, instead, insists that when the stigmatized,
ostracized pilate finally takes offense at the way others have treated her, she
is liberated and empowere

igmatized identity, the narrative, even as it presents pilate as a
shameless individual and a member of the black underclass, also constructs
her as a healing figure and insists that she gains a kind of power and freedom
as she resists the shame-binding rules of black society. described as a “natural
healer” (150) and as a person who values human—and family—connections
above all else, pilate becomes the site in the text of redemptive folk values.
in its representation of pilate, song of solomon deliberately carries out
an antishaming agenda as it invokes but also interrogates degrading stereotypes
of the black underclass woman. yet it also insists that pilate’s grand
daughter, hagar—who is “prissy” and hates “dirt and disorganization”—is
“embarrassed” by her mother and grandmother (150, 151). returning to its
concern with the issues of class and shame and the color-caste hierarchy in
the construction of african-american identities, the narrative describes how

rter as a gentle lover and potential rescuer
of corinthians but also as a killer. and even as it seems intent on humanizing
porter and thus counteracting the initial shaming and racist representation of
him as a “wild man in the attic,” it also reminds readers that he is the “same 
shame, trauma, and race in the novels of toni morrison 73
henry porter” who had “screamed, wept, waved a shotgun, and urinated over
the heads of the women in the yard” (28, 199).
in a similar way, song of solomon sends out contradictory messages in its
presentation of the underclass guitar, who is initially described as the person
who can “liberate” milkman (36) and yet who ultimately tries to kill milkman.
“wanna fly, you got to give up the shit that weighs you down,” guitar
tells milkman when they see a white peacock that can fly “no better than a
chicken” because of its jewelry-like tail. “all that jewelry weighs it down. like
vanity. can’t nobody fly with all that shit,” guitar ins

 that shit,” the narrative also registers uneasiness about
guitar, who comes to embody black middle-class fears about the potentially
destructive shame-rage of the violent black underclass male.
“if things ever got tough, you’d melt. you’re not a serious person, milkman,”
guitar remarks at one point (104). unlike milkman, who is bored by
talk of “insults, violence, and oppression” (107), guitar becomes consumed
by racial politics. bringing in guitar’s oppositional voice, song of solomon
examines the construction of conflicting black political identities, contrasting
the middle-class assimilationist milkman and the lower-class black nationalist
guitar. for someone like guitar, to live in a racist society that persecutes
and stigmatizes poor black people is to live in a state of chronic shame-rage.
the site of black rage and revenge in the text, guitar has been contrastingly
described as a character that morrison “purposefully makes . . . fascinating”

n he kills whites—for he does not kill
out of anger or for amusement or to gain power or money—guitar explains
that he participates in revenge killings because he loves black people and
because he wants the black–white ratio to remain static. while the “earth is
soggy with black people’s blood” and white people cannot be cured of their
depravity, the seven days is nevertheless “trying to make a world where one
day white people will think before they lynch” (158, 160). if song of solomon
at first glance appears to reinforce the stereotype of the pathological, violent
black man in its description of the seven days, the narrative also actively
reprojects the shame associated with this derogatory stereotype onto whites.
it does this by revealing that guitar and his cohorts are driven mad by the
violent acts they commit and that their behavior is an imitation of the racist
violence perpetrated by whites against african americans. and even as

the final sections of the novel which describe how guitar hunts down milkman,
intent on killing him.
if part i of song of solomon, in showing that milkman is weighed down
by the “shit” of inherited racial shame, ends in an emotional impasse, part ii
attempts to work through milkman’s shame-shame feeling trap by describing
how he comes to take pride in his family roots. thus, according to the
standard, text-directed reading of song of solomon, when milkman goes on
his journey to danville and shalimar in search of pilate’s buried gold, he
discovers, instead, the real golden treasure of his family roots. but what suc

readings tend to bypass are the shame and pain associated with milkman’s
discovery. in using folk tale and magic and following the pattern of the hero’s
purposeful quest as it describes milkman’s journey south, song of solomon also
deflects attention away from the trauma and violence that have threatened to
interrupt—if not disrupt and fragment—the narrative from the beginning,
not only in the story of guitar but also in the family story of the deads.
what lies behind the dark comedy of manners and grotesqueries of morrison’s
interwoven and layered narratives about the dead family is an originary

takes place before a group, losing can be “devastating,” for the “loser may
be seen as ineffectual, or even worse, effeminate” (majors and billson 97,
93, 92, 97).8 in its staging of the dozens game, song of solomon dramatizes
the link between shaming insults and violence by showing how the “namecalling
toilet contest” between milkman and the shalimar men (269) leads
to a fight between a knife-wielding local man and milkman, who defends
himself with a broken bottle. afterward an enraged milkman thinks that

milkman’s moment of manly pride by interjecting into this scene a peacock,
which was established earlier in the text as a signifier of false male pride
(283; see 179). the narrative also sends out mixed messages in its description
of milkman’s discovery of his true family name as he decodes the children’s
song—the song of solomon—which is the original version of pilate’s blues
song. milkman is initially elated when he learns that his grandfather, macon
dead, was jake, the son of the flying african—solomon—who left his wife
and twenty-one children and flew back to africa. “that motherfucker could
fly! could fly! . . . he could fly his own self! . . . he just took off; got fed up. all
the way up! . . . no more shit! he flew, baby” (328). but to fly away is also, the
narrative insists, to place individual needs

the community. “who’d he leave behind?” sweet asks milkman. “everybody!
he left everybody down on the ground and he sailed on off like a black eagle.
‘o-o-o-o-o-o solomon done fly, solomon done gone / solomon cut across
the sky, solomon gone home!’” (328–29). the “song of solomon” is, at once,
a song of male pride and shame, for as morrison herself has remarked, “the
fathers may soar, they may triumph, they may leave, but the children know
who they are; they remember, half in glory and half in accusation” (watkins
46, emphasis added). thus flying—the proud and glorious moment of escape
from the “shit” of racial shame—is also associated with the blaming, shaming
accusations of those left behind. in a similar way, as milkman takes pride in

the text’s hesitancies and ambivalences—which originate in its painful
emotional content—are given final expression in the closing scenes. “perhaps
that’s what all human relationships boiled down to: would you save my life?
or would you take it?” milkman thinks when he realizes that a “deranged”
guitar is after him (331, 330). in an uncanny repetition of family trauma, the
trauma-haunted pilate is killed by guitar after she buries her father’s remains
on solomon’s leap. pilate’s final words are healing. “i wish i’d a knowed more
people. i would of loved ’em all,” she tells milkman. “if i’d a knowed more, i
would a loved more” (336). constructed as an ancestor figure in this scene—
as an embodiment of folk wisdom and natural pride—pilate can fly without
leaving the ground. and yet the killing of pilate—the character designated by
the narrative as a natural healer—suggests the text’s inability to heal the deep

death,” his action is irresponsible,
for he avoids “doing something meaningful in life, preferring the sumptuous
illusion that he will ride the air” (brenner 119). but although the narrative
seems unable to transform, in any permanent way, shame into pride, most
critic-readers follow the text’s directives and interpret the closure as a heroic
gesture and thus an affirmation of black pride and achievement. such commentators
assert that milkman’s final gesture “affirms his relation to solomon
and pilate” and as a “‘lodestar’ setting his own course, he meets them in their
mythic and elemental flight,” or they argue that milkman, in his final flight,
is able to “transcend death” and “embrace the life of humanity” (carmean
61, o’shaughnessy 125). since milkman “has achieved . . . connectedness”
to his african-american community, “it does not matter whether milkman
survives his encounter with guitar,” writes one commentator (duvall, “doe
hunting” 111). an

d yet another asserts, “the novel does not end with a cliffhanger;
the final battle is both a confrontation and a confirmation, marking
milkman’s emergence as a champion who understands and will defend his
world,” and whether or not milkman dies, his “joyful acceptance of the burden
of his past transforms his leap toward guitar into a triumphant flight”
(a. leslie harris 71, 76).
that most critic-readers enact an antishaming gesture as they turn
shame into pride suggests that song of solomon generates in some readers the
wish to rescue the character and also to avoid the painful content of the novel
by reading it primarily as an ultimately triumphant “heroic” quest. because
shame is a contagious emotion and, indeed, people are ashamed of shame,
critic-readers may feel at once riveted to the text, which appeals to readers’
voyeuristic interests, but also want to avert their gaze—that is, avoid or
bypass the shameful content of the novel. the novel itself, while shaming the

real gold milkman seeks is the golden legacy of his racial heritage. indeed, the
myth of the flying african encapsulates the fantasy-wish to escape or bypass
the “shit” of racial oppression and shame and also the desire to convert shame
into pride.
there may be something golden in the survival of the slaves and of family
stories about one’s black family roots in slavery, but slavery also constitutes
a shameful and largely secret legacy in the african-american cultural
memory. in song of solomon, morrison focuses on intraracial shaming, the
color-caste hierarchy, and black-on-black violence as she depicts the effects

of shame and trauma on the lives of african americans and on the construction
of african-american cultural and political identities. while morrison,

6. as utelinde wedertz-furtado points out, it is significant that guitar
remarks that the seven days organization originated after the blinding of a black
veteran of world war i (see song of solomon 155). by linking 1920s black militancy
to that of the 1960s, “morrison suggests the cyclical rising of black militant
groups after non-violent means have failed to guarantee justice and civil rights”
(227). ralph story links the seven days to black secret societies of the nineteenth
century, such as the knights of liberty, an organization that was formed in 1846
to free slaves (152). guitar’s advocacy of violence also recalls the militant rhetoric
of the 1920s inspired by the black nation

in fact it was at the 1985 faulkner and yoknapatawpha conference in
oxford, mississippi, that morrison once again elaborated a self-representation
regarding her relation to her published fiction, the story in which she
continues to be the writer who was almost a writer. although in 1983 she
claimed she knew she was a writer after completing sula, in 1985 morrison
gives a different account of when her sense of herself as a writer emerged:

on decidedly male grounds. from the novel’s one-word dedication (daddy),
morrison draws upon a transfigured representation of her own family history,
emphasizing male genealogy. the novel’s very title derives from what

morrison tells colette dowling, “because of some debts my grandfather, who

hile it does seem significant that smith wishes to fly to canada, that site
of freedom for african americans escaping slavery, it probably is a pointless
exercise attempting to name the precise michigan locale (could it be
working-class marion or port huron?). what this ambiguous geographical
reference points to is that, fictively speaking, morrison hasn’t left home yet.
morrison seems to confirm the irrelevance of specific locale in a comment
she makes to jane bakerman at the time of song of solomon’s publication: “i
think i call [the setting] michigan; they sort of travel around a little bit. but 
song of solomon, narrative identity, and the faulknerian intertext 89
all of mine start here in the midwest!” (39). milkman’s michigan, morrison’s
comment suggests, is but a minor displacement from the novelist’s ohio and
her own working-class, great lakes town of lorain. yet although morrison
metaphorically stays at home, leaving home is precisely what milkman dead
thinks he wants.

in this regard, song of solomon participates in and arguably completes
morrison’s fictive meditation on those aspects of authorship that are linked
to the cultural masculine. soaphead church opens the space of writerly selfexamination;
shadrack pushes this reflexive examination into the realm of
communal ritual. but morrison’s third novel is a departure from the first two
in its focus on a male character, milkman dead, a name that had served as
the working title for song of solomon. in bringing african-american male
identity to the foreground, anthony/toni has performed a daring experiment
with gender that her act of self-naming suggests: song of solomon is a portrait
of the african-american woman novelist as a young man. beginning on
morrison’s date of birth, the novel takes us through the first thirty-two years
of milkman’s life. what is striking is how this time frame corresponds to the
fictional milkman’s real-life double, toni morrison. milkman’s story stops

at
the moment of a completed project of self-discovery, authenticity, and connection
to his ancestors. like another novel published in 1977, leslie marmon
silko’s ceremony, song of solomon tells of a movement from alienation
to authenticity. in morrison’s life, the time of the novel’s ending (1963) corresponds
to a time of upheaval—a marriage that had soured, an impending
divorce, and an almost therapeutic turn to fiction as she joins a writer’s group.
in short, milkman is represented as having achieved an authentic identity at
the very moment when morrison begins her search for identity through her
writing, and he undergoes the same self-examination crucial to other morr

characters, such as soaphead church, sula, pilate, and subsequently
jadine childs in tar baby.
in a novel that focuses on matters of african-american masculine identity,
it is worth speculating on such identity as it may relate to morrison’s
sense of authorial identity. if morrison engages ralph ellison intertextually
in the bluest eye, a similar project of reclamation occurs in song of solomon.
only now it is faulkner, whose major texts examine the forces that shape the
identity of southern white men, who is the focus of morrison’s gaze.
the faulknerian intertext, however, is not as overtly signaled as the biblical
intertext of song of solomon. morrison’s act of naming her third novel at
first suggests the kind of mythic intertext that james joyce invokes in ulysses.
but the biblical intertext of morrison’s title does not supply the kind of narrative
context that the odyssey pr

is, an evocative rendering of the narrator’s stance toward the story related. the
biblical poem of solomon does suggest certain ways of thinking about morrison’s
novel: both solomon’s song and the song milkman discovers that sings
his family’s african genealogy detail sexual suffering. the dialogue between
the lovers in the biblical text speaks to milkman’s relationship with hagar,
just as morrison’s meditation on american culture’s reification of color makes
the woman’s assertion, “i am very dark, but comely” (song sol. 1.5), resonate
in a culturally fresh way. at the same time, the verse also points to the way

of solomon, the explicit intertext of morrison’s act of titling deflects attention
away from her reading and recasting of faulkner, a project that continues
even into morrison’s later fiction, which is more invested in recovering african-american
history. to approach morrison with faulkner as one context is
to hear a critical dialogue that can be taken as an african-american reclamation
of canonical modernism.

faulkner’s lucas beauchamp, the descendant of a white plantation owner’s
incestuous miscegenation and perhaps faulkner’s most complex rendering of
african-american masculinity, speaks to the possibilities of self-fashioning.
like morrison, faulkner changed his name, adding the “u” to his patronymic
as a symbolic act of self-fathering. morrison’s reference to john solomon
willis, her maternal grandfather, is interesting, inasmuch as she appropriates

refigurations of the african-american aesthetic past (heinze 10–11). awkward’s

reading of hurston, since such a reading strategy is already legitimated

impulse forms part of the writer’s intentions. we might say, for
example, that morrison’s previous work on the classics as an undergraduate
at howard university prepared her to make the kinds of claims she does in
her master’s thesis about faulkner. so that when one sees incest and family
history as elements of morrison’s fictional matter in, say, the bluest eye
or song of solomon, one need not attribute this presence to faulkner per
se nor even to greek tragedy. the relation between morrison’s texts and
those of the aesthetic past, therefore, is not determined but overdetermined.
what this means from a reader’s perspective is that numerous cultural texts

examine incest and that this whole matrix of prior representations becomes
available for a critical examination of what and how incest might mean in
morrison’s work.

in distinguishing herself from faulkner, hardy, and joyce, morrison
stresses the particularity of african-american experience, from its aurality
to its investment in the supernatural (152–53).
both the leclair and the mckay interviews, however, serve as a prelude
to morrison’s much fuller treatments of the ways faulkner may have
influenced her. morrison’s remarks framing her reading from her then workin-progress

clearly, morrison still reads faulkner. and if she still turns to faulkner’s
texts, how is she to contain that “very personal” and “enormous effect”
(“faulkner” 296)? does faulkner exist for her as a reader, as a teacher, as a
critic, but not as writer? this writerly desire to deny influence leads morrison
to a compartmentalizing of self and identity that belies her portrayals
of characters who overcome such fragmentation.

lkner proceeds from
being “fascinated by what it means to write like” faulkner, she is reading the
same way she reads cather and hemingway—as a writer reading. it may be
a useful and enabling fiction for morrison to see her novels as unmarked by
faulkner. nevertheless, the rhetorical separation between reader and writer
that morrison wishes to maintain in her critical discourse largely collapses.
as a step toward seeing morrison as a writer reading faulkner, i wish to
consider her song of solomon as a rewriting of faulkner’s go down, moses. the
critical dialogue in which song of solomon engages go down, moses suggests
that she reclaims faulkner in ways that question the male-centered world of
the hunt and that refuse the gambit of tragedy.

in her master’s thesis, morrison’s characterization of thomas sutpen’s and
quentin compson’s alienated relation to history also accurately describes
isaac mccaslin’s alienation from his past as he comes of age in a defeated
south and

miscegenation (“alienation” 24). her own character, milkman dead, in song

of solomon, similarly comes of age alienated from his family’s history, almost
as a result, one might say, of patriarchs such as lucius quintus carothers
mccaslin, whose forced mixture of the races in mississippi results in the
special status accorded lighter-skinned african americans in milkman
dead’s michigan. in other words, ike’s family problem, as he confronts the
racism of the white community, is too much history; milkman’s difficulty in

i) is not enough history. but while go down, moses is another tragedy (inasmuch
as roth edmonds repeats his great-great-great grandfather’s incestuous
miscegenation, the act that motivated isaac’s repudiation in the first
place), song of solomon, although similarly structured by intergenerational
repetitions, finds milkman ultimately breaking free of certain destructive
cycles of the dead family and western patriarchal social organization.8
a number of other parallels invite a consideration of these two narratives

 for characters. both novels blur boundaries between the natural
and supernatural worlds. but perhaps most important, the creation of the
adult subjectivity of isaac mccaslin in go down, moses and milkman dead
in song of solomon serves as the site of conflict and competition. certainly
those who struggle to create isaac’s and milkman’s subjectivities bear certain
parallels. macon dead, for example, approximates mccaslin edmonds, while
guitar and pilate split the function of sam fathers.9
in go down, moses, mccaslin edmonds speaks the paternal voice of
the old south, inviting isaac to take his rightful place in l. q. c. mccaslin’s
patriarchal design. similarly, macon hopes to create in milkman a son who

what of course is chilling in macon’s pedagogical moment, teaching his
son the path toward self-possession, is that the father, himself the son of
a former slave, advocates owning others as a component of self-possession.

macon’s teachings are subverted, however, from two directions—by his
sister pilate and by milkman’s friend guitar—and their presence together
seems to constitute a play on faulkner’s sam fathers, the former slave who
ultimately teaches ike mccaslin an alternative to owning things. both

whether milkman will grow up to be “white” or a “black”; that is, will milkman
accept the values of the african-american middle class, which models
itself on white middle-class american culture, or will milkman cast his
lot with the african-american community? here again, morrison seems to
equate black authenticity with black poverty, for the only african-american
communities in the song of solomon are economically distressed.
one particular moment when guitar tries to comfort his friend
occurs after milkman strikes macon for hitting ruth, milkman’s mother.
guitar’s sympathy takes the form of a brief narrative based on his hunting
experience:
anyway i stayed on the trail until i saw some bushes. the light

returns by the story’s end to the specificity of the young african-american
woman. after learning that his kinsman roth edmonds has repeated the
very act—incestuous miscegenation—that caused him, ike, to repudiate his
patrimony, he intuits that the deer roth has killed is a doe.
in both go down, moses and song of solomon, then, killing a doe
metaphorically suggests hurting an african-american woman. yet in
guitar’s realization that milkman doesn’t grasp the metaphor (“chances

of wry intertextual gloss that calls into question the efficacy of the metaphor,
a metaphor that suggests that the female’s safety depends upon the honor of
good male hunters. in partic

moreover, porter’s assertion to the women below that “i love ya” casts an odd
light on guitar’s insistence that his killing of whites is motivated purely by
love of african-american people. to link milkman and guitar in ideological

by the african-american underclass. nevertheless, the way these males

see the issue of race bracketed momentarily and instead discover what is

as the hunters finish their work, milkman asks them what they plan to do with
the bobcat. the hunters’ two-word response (“eat him”) returns us to an earlier
key moment in milkman and guitar’s friendship, when they prepare to steal
pilate’s “gold,” the bag that actually contains the remains of jake, milkman’s
paternal grandfather. milkman and guitar, passing a buick dealership, see a
white peacock, which milkman notes for it
 
 ___________________________
 
buick seems suggestive,
since macon purchases a new buick every two years; thus, the peacock
on the car indicates the way macon’s wealth props up milkman. guitar’s
description of the peacock’s failure to fly well certainly is apropos of the
milkman who flies off to danville, pennsylvania, to find the gold, since
milkman carries with him all the markers of comfortable middle-class life,
notably, his cutty sark, a gold longines watch, and his florsheim shoes.
and, after offending the men at solomon’s store in shalimar by his showy
display of wealth and inquiries about their women, milkman is linked both
metonymically and metaphorically to another cock, “a black rooster [that]
strutted by, its blood-red comb draped forward like a wicked brow” (265).
song of solomon’s drama of the peacock and the bobcat raises questions
about the nature of the male world of the hunt—a world go down, moses
celebrates—through a complex series of self-reflexive turns: while hunting

in moving toward the perspective of pilate, milkman aligns himself
with the one character in the novel who has achieved a special purchase on
patriarchal forms of social organization. because she has no navel, she is
prevented from joining a community in the prescribed fashion, as a woman
claimed in marriage by a man; to have sex with a man is to reveal she has no
navel and thus to be shunned for her difference. after her split with macon,

late to get her hair done, neither beautician wants to do her hair, but as marcelline
rationalizes, it’s best not to turn hagar down because pilate “wouldn’t
like it” (312). if people turn to pilate, it is because she has conjure powers and
potions, can defeat apparently physically stronger men, and can also make
fools of the police.
in addition to her spiritual powers, she also has an expressive form—the
song she sings at milkman’s birth that is the secret genealogy of the solomon
family. but although figuring elements of artistic identity, she is not the artist
whole and complete; she may be the keeper of the oral text and its medium,
but she does not know its meaning. nevertheless, by expressing both the
spiritual and the aesthetic, pilate makes a turn that sula cannot. sula’s limitation
is that her artistic gaze cannot encompass the moral and the ethical;
her sexuality is her only textuality. but pilate insists on the realm of morality,
perhaps best indicated by the

spirituality she represents, and—along with her matrilineal household—creates
a link between american and west african culture, a link that morrison
develops more fully in beloved through baby suggs’s religion of the maternal

and trying to discover where circe lives, milkman asks direction of a man
whose description matches jake’s above: “one of them was a negro. a tall

oleh, chief, grandfather indeed!16
milkman’s encounter with circe is even more decidedly ghostly, marked
by a particular recurring smell that announces the onset of possible supernatural
moments in song of solomon: “a sweet spicy perfume. like ginger
root—pleasant, clean, seductive” (239).17 the odor of ginger masks what had
seconds earlier been an overwhelming stench of decay. from this dreamlike
encounter with a woman who, as milkman notes, “had to be dead” (241), he
gets decisive clues both to the reality of ghosts and to uncovering his family’s
history—the names of his paternal grandfather and grandmother, jake and

enactment of southern white identity as inauthentic and embraces instead
that of his native-american/african-american mentor, sam fathers. just as
faulkner uses his character ike, the one who produces an active interpretation
of a coded text, to allegorize the eccentricity of artistic consciousness, morrison
also uses milkman’s act of interpretation to suggest his path toward artistic
production. in terms of artistic identity, by reading correctly the meaning
of the children’s song of solomon, milkman becomes the other half of the
equation, completing pilate’s reproduction of the text by supplying its latent
meaning. in the novel’s allegorizing of authorship, it seems that one does not
get to be pilate unless one has also been milkman. in 1963 morrison, like her
fictive double milkman, is poised to make a turn toward family history and

ts feminine counterparts (an

inappropriate to label macon as the sole or final author of hagar’s desire, for
he merely embodies the larger metaphysical system that informs men that
they have priority over women and that tells african americans that white is
good and black is bad.
if all he learned was that his great-grandfather reputedly could fly, then
milkman’s joy at the novel’s ending would be trivial. song of solomon, morrison’s
first novel to foreground the activity of men, however, raises a tough
question—one that cannot be answered fully by one novel: is it possible for
african-american men to reconceive their masculinity in a nonpatriarchal
fashion, that is, in a way that does not reduce african-american women
to objects of possession? the example of milkman dead suggests that the

possibility is open for such a reconception. ike

is pilate’s flying, the ability to transcend self and self-love. and surely pilate’s
claim serves as an intratextual critique pointing out the inauthenticity of
guitar’s claim (one echoed by porter and robert smith) that the seven days’
killing is done for love. what weighed milkman down for so much of song of
solomon is male ego (much as hagar is destroyed by her desire to be the desire
of male ego), forged in the structures of a patriarchal society.
the novel’s conclusion is noteworthy for its ambiguity that has occasioned
a variety of critical response.20 does milkman actually fly? does he

matter whether milkman survives. he has achieved the very connection to an

identify, especially in the aftermath of publishing her best-selling third
novel. and that is because morrison herself does not choose black poverty
as the location of her cultural identity. put another way, in a heated exchange
between milkman and guitar, guitar attacks his younger friend for hanging
out with the black middle class. milkman responds, unconsciously echoing
his father, “what’s wrong with negroes owning beach houses?” (103). in
1977 and in terms of the logic of song of solomon, morrison’s answer is fairly
straightforward: quite a bit is wrong with such ownership because it inhibits
the possibility of authenticity. yet in a 1998 profile of the author, morrison’s
attitude toward possession seems markedly different:
even without the upcoming tour [to promote paradise], morrison’s
life seems hectic. she rents an apartment near princeton university
in new jersey [ . . . ]; another apartment in lower manhattan; and
a stone house in rockland county, n.y. plus, she is

residences? or four, counting the house in progress? “i was a child

about eviction.” (gray 68)
how might one account for this changed attitude from the time morrison
was composing song of solomon in the mid-1970s to this more recent and
relaxed position?
her third novel was the main selection of the book of the month
club, the first african-american novel so designated since richard wright’s
native son. additionally, song of solomon won awards from both the national
critic’s circle and the american academy and institute of arts and letters.

her to rethink her early fiction’s identifications. clearly she must have realized
that having money does not necessarily mean that an african american is
“white” or a sellout. what she would need was a way to reimagine blackness
that allowed for the individual to develop economically as well as spiritually.

the chapter that follows explores tar baby, the novel that morrison
wrote after song of solomon and that begins the author’s attempt to rethink
blackness and its relation to class. like her previous novel’s title, tar baby
overtly signals one of her intertexts, this time the african-american folk
tale. and just as in song of solomon, morrison rewrites a modernist, but

her use of invisible man and go down, moses—the triumphant achievement
of completed authenticity (milkman) and the valorization of the black
agrarian community (shalimar). in rewriting her modernist novel, as well as
her fictively imagined self, morrison points the way to an understanding of
her later novels as the product of postmodern blackness. morrison’s exploration
of african-american identity through a transfigured meditation on
her male genealogy in song of solomon becomes in tar baby a coded meditation
on descent through the female side of her family. morrison’s intensely
reflexive fourth novel crucially participates in her fictive project of reclaiming
both modernist technique and personal identity. near the end of song
of solomon, milkman’s voice echoes across the valley as he calls to guitar, a
moment suggesting the hinge that joins the doubled worlds of these two
novels: tar, tar, tar—tar baby.

he wins himself. and the quality of his life improves immeasurably. whether its
length improves or lengthens is irrelevant” (50).

klan. for african americans it is often a dangerous place where orphanhood
is not a metaphor for innocence or liberation. in a sense, morrison puts
this metaphor on trial, asking as she does in playing in the dark: “what are
americans always so insistently innocent of?” (playing 45).
the novel’s historical allusions establish a world in which african americans

and post-reconstruction america, song of solomon marks its temporal periods
with the devastating loss of fathers and ancestors, including ruth’s and
guitar’s as well as macon’s and pilate’s.2 it is not until milkman asks about
his grandfather’s killers that he begins to understand why everyone around
him seems haunted or unhinged:

the death of an ancestor is thus experienced not only as the unredressed loss
of an individual figure but also of a collective sense of belonging to the land
as legitimate citizens rather than as slaves or ex-slaves. for every african
american who steps forward and is cut down, countless others relinquish
considering the attempt. as milkman gradually discovers, the significance
of the first macon dead’s farm lies with the fact that it spoke to other men
“like a sermon”:
“you see?”

spond, in a way, to the words of martin luther
king (also shot to death) on the refusal to wait in the sidelines for equity or
acceptance:
when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of
“nobodiness”—then you will understand why we find it difficult to
wait. there comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and
men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair.
i hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable
impatience. (qtd. in race 72)
song of solomon repeatedly establishes the exigency of justice for african
americans, compelling formidable questions about the definition and
implementation of this concept or ideal. does justice, for instance, necessarily
involve retribution, law, obligation and consequence? or, does it rest
on something else altogether—and, if so, how does one begin to define and
exercise it? does it require guitar’s malcolm x-like desire for restitution, or
pilate’s belief in being haunted? does it somehow require bo

however, at the same time that this passage applauds the manipulation of
legal policies, it also indicates the extent to which american law persistently
shuts down black freedom, progressively subdivides legislation to sustain the
inequity and segregation depicted in the novel.
with direct references to dates and names, song of solomon offers us
glimpses of the judicial history of the us, from the establishment of the
freedmen’s bureau in the nineteenth century to the segregated hospitals and
cemeteries of the twentieth. it opens with a suicide note dated 1931, and thus
calls attention to a time when organizations like the naacp were underway

ent persistently stayed out of the states’ detours
around the constitution. due to formidable resistance from southern states,
efforts to secure congressional action against lynching repeatedly met with
defeat. as bardolph so movingly puts it, “for the years 1910 to 1938, there is
nothing to report in the way of federal legislation to protect [african americans]
from injury and outrage, and to accelerate their progress toward full
enjoyment of their civil rights” (188).
throughout song of solomon, references to lynching and to the fear of
being lynched consistently emerge, recalling the fact that black men and
women, well into the twentieth century, found themselves with few legal protections
from violence and murder. pilate, for instance, relies on this truth of
african american life when she spins the yarn to the sheriff that the bones in
her sack belong to the body of her lynched husband. and guitar’s involvement
in the seven days is, as he announces, “‘about trying to make a w

me a delayed solution is a non-solution. or i’ll say it another way.
if it must take violence to get the black man his human rights in
this country, i’m for violence. (autobiography 367)
through similar statements, guitar speaks for the necessity of justice to
inhere in some principle of restitution or repercussion. his outrage sheds 
justice and citizenship in toni morrison’s song of solomon 125
light on the pressure for citizenship and the law: while these concepts may
be anchored in a flawed structure (of white patriarchy) they carry certain
preliminary obligations and protection from harm. they also bury the legal
definitions of african americans as property.3
guitar’s words summon a history of white violence, including not only
lynching but also the dangerous work relegated to black labourers. this latter
aspect transpires in the memory of his father’s death at the saw mill

it becomes an object of interpretation in the novel. her father’s words, “‘sing,

mother, they also form a command and link pilate’s singing to her past—even
her slave past, where singing often functioned as a way for slaves to get around
the laws that prevented them from talking to each other. pilate’s father’s ghost

speaks from another realm and time, and his words are not entirely clear or
readable. they are distorted by the unjust circumstances of his death and they
call for the living’s willingness to heed and interpret them.
in the philosophy of the limit, a study of deconstruction and justice,
drucilla cornell similarly and persuasively illustrates that justice involves at
once a call to interpretation and a barrier to full accessibility. justice rests
on one’s humility, she says, before the o

 this is a disrupted ontology, a conjoining
of being and non-being that “does not [ . . . ] begin with the “i” that strives to

for its own contradiction and destruction. and it is interpretation that
separates law from justice—releasing both from myths of atemporal morality
and permitting an opening for responsibility and for what she calls the dream
of the “subject of dialogue” (177).

and for which guitar speaks; the promise pilate secures introduces the ideal
of justice that extends beyond retaliation or restitution. and the whole scene
rests on one person listening to another. pilate discerns the necessity or ethics
of listening from her father’s ghost. like interpretation, listening involves
being in contact and being open to the call of responsibility.
this “being in contact” involves questions of ontology and citizenship in
song of solomon, questions and possibilities that form around pilate’s absent
navel. frightening as it is to most characters in the text, her absent navel signifies
a new way of being and of being just in the world: beyond blood lines
and blood kinship, and towards an articulated, performed relationship with
others. this new relationship with others is made urgent, moreover, through

nd to keep it that way” (qtd. in jim crow guide 61). in the midtwentieth
century, most states prohibited intermarriage and classified black
people as those possessing any trace of african blood whatsoever, which led, of
course, to more legislation in the matter of blood donations and transfusions.
in an incredibly tongue-in-cheek and well-researched exposé of american
racism, titled the jim crow guide to the usa (first published in 1959), 
justice and citizenship in toni morrison’s song of solomon 131
stetson kennedy addresses statutory definitions of race. he explains, for
instance, that:
most american laws defining race are not to be compared with
those once enforced by nazi germany, the latter being relatively
more liberal. in the view of the nazis, persons having less than
one-fourth jewish blood could qualify as aryans, whereas many
of the american laws specify that persons having one-eighth, onesixteenth,
or “any ascertainable” negro blood are negroes in the
eyes of the law and

this focus on blood, this other “red scare,” undergirded a politics of racial
identity and promoted the capitalist structure. as du bois repeatedly pointed
out, white labourers joined white landholders against black labourers, insuring
their own economic oppression in the process. blood was linked to the
privileges of white society; it created a diversion from issues of poverty and
injustice across the races, and the civil rights leaders knew it.
in song of solomon, blood kinship is disconnected from a vision of justice
and citizenship. blood is not the ink that inscribes identity and belonging.
while it symbolizes certain bonds, it has nothing to do with their articulation
and enaction. pilate both asserts and does not assert lines of blood. when
she explains her anger to the man who beats reba, for instance, she asks,
“‘you know how mamas are, don’t you? you got a mama, ain’t you?’” (94). in

rt violence, she calls up the
significance of a blood bond. it is uttered, even manipulated, to make a connection
that is not based on blood. she also does not differentiate between
those to whom responsibility is and is not owed. she keeps a bag of a dead
stranger’s bones with her, contending that “‘the dead you kill is yours’” (208).
these words rung out across the american soil, soggy with black people’s
blood. song of solomon is a novel about the power of articulation over blood
relations—the articulation or call that announces citizenship and animates
justice. it is echoed later in beloved’s epigraph: “i will call them my people
which were not my people. and her beloved which was not beloved.”

of southern woodlands; she accordingly forces a reevaluation of african

novels “that have documented and refashioned ethnic identities in the

for a moment annie dillard’s discourse on “seeing” in her staple of american
nature writing, pilgrim at tinker creek. like wordsworth in his poems
on childhood, dillard romanticizes infancy as a time of hypersensitive perception.
she accordingly laments the passage of innocence that accompanies
adult knowledge and the consequent loss of “newly sighted” vision that follows 
song of solomon and the blasted pastoral 141
our immersion in language systems. “form is condemned to an eternal danse
macabre with meaning,” she writes. dillard therefore desires to see “the world
unraveled from reason, eden before adam gave names.” she is unable as an
adult to see the “color patches” she believes she saw as an infant. “my brain
then must have been smooth as any balloon,” she reflects. “i’m told i reached

ked him from the city, unleashes on milkman
his history of racial frustration. as grewal notes, “guitar’s problem is
a baneful race politics sowing discord with hate.” earlier in the novel, we
learn how guitar attempts to check hate crimes against black people by
murdering white people. he wants to keep the ratio of black to white in
balance. before milkman begins his trip south, guitar reminds him about
the links between racial oppression and the control of land holdings: “the

earth is soggy with black people’s blood. and before us indian blood . . . and
if it keeps on there won’t be any of us left and there won’t be any land for
those who are left. so the numbers [the ratio of black to white people] have
to remain static” (158). guitar’s statement recalls eldridge cleaver’s point
about the “deep land hunger” of african americans: “suffice it to say that
afro-americans are just as land hungry as were the mau mau, the chi

escape it. furthermore, after this “sermon” on the land, in a descent from
the sublime moment that is even more poignant than milkman’s interrupted
merging with the sweet gum tree, the narrative shifts. in the next paragraph
following the command to “pass it on!” we read: “but they shot the top of
his head off and ate his fine georgia peaches. and even as boys these men

longevity in the place but also the will of the male progenitors who would
shape the future of african american existence in that particular region.

contrast to the tradition of ego dissolution in american nature writing,

interesting questions arise when we consider a hybrid literature such as song
of solomon that illuminates the lives of african american subjects while
making use of british and anglo-american narrative conventions, or, conversely,
literature by writers of the dominant culture that appropriates the
conventions of, say, native american or african american art.20 we may
ask such questions as: how innocent (or not) is a writer’s use of the themes,
subjects, and narrative forms of the other culture? to what extent does a

it would be wrongheaded, buell asserts, to think of ortiz as having been
“colonized” by the time he spent at a writing program at iowa or as “using
western lyric conventions of persona and aesthetic distance to deconstruct
them.”21 my initial reading of song of solomon was, perhaps, wrongheaded
in this sense: i believed morrison’s use of such conventions as the moment
of ego dissolution in the woods to be a parody of the mystical “nature writing”
dominated by anglo-american writers. a more constructive approach
to morrison’s fiction, however, may ask how her “hybrid” art takes risks by
placing an african american protagonist in a situation where he “finds”
himself after losing his material well-being, after his magnificent ego is

had an enormous effect on me, an enormous effect” (“faulkner and women”

however, morrison’s thesis, “virginia woolf ’s and william faulkner’s treatment
of the alienated,” also provides the basis for drawing thematic comparisons
between quentin compson’s story in the two faulkner novels that
it considers, absalom, absalom! and the sound and the fury, and morrison’s
own bildungsroman, song of solomon.

interview concerning paradise that isolation “carries the seeds of its
own destruction.” indeed, richard misner says in that novel, “isolation
kills generations. it has no future” (paradise 210). morrison’s thesis carefully
chronicles the destruction wrought by isolation in the lives of both
quentin compson and thomas sutpen, two protagonists that she feels
faulkner “doomed to a tragic failure” (3); this failure stemming from isola-

tion later becomes one of the major faulknerian themes that her own work
acts against. in the signifying monkey, henry louis gates, jr. suggests that
african american writers often revise western texts with what he describes
as “a compelling sense of difference based on the black vernacular” (xxii).
by keeping this process in mind, readers can resist privileging either author
and simply ask how these sorts of interpretations add to our understanding
of each writer’s work. guitar even

implicitly calls for such revision in
song of solomon when he tells milkman that white people “know they are
unnatural. their writers and artists have been saying it for years. telling
them they are unnatural, telling them they are depraved. they call it tragedy”
(157). morrison’s third novel seems to “naturalize,” as guitar might say,
what morrison deems problematic in the two faulknerian tragedies that
her thesis addresses. morrison reworks, with regard to the specific theories
that she articulates in her thesis, the isolation that doo

to triumph in song of solomon. morrison, consciously or unconsciously,
reprises faulkner’s original theme and makes it her own in this novel that
celebrates community and vanquishes the destructive isolation that she sees
as the dark heart of faulkner’s fiction.

milkman’s and quentin’s stories parallel most obviously in that both characters
engage in a quest centered in history. morrison once described song of
solomon as “my own giggle (in afro-american terms) of the proto-myth of
the journey to manhood” (“u

hreve, quentin’s roommate at harvard, forces quentin to make an
uninformed choice in responding to his famous question about why quentin
hates the south: “shreve forces him [quentin] into an oral confirmation
that he has here-to-fore evaded” (28). according to morrison, quentin’s
anguished cry of “i dont hate it!” necessarily becomes his “acceptance of 
154 lorie watkins fulton
rosa coldfield’s loyalty to the south as more valid than his father’s negativism”
(28).
in song of solomon morrison puts milkman through the same sort of
historical reconstruction that quentin attempts, but she gives him far more
to work with and allows him to make a more informed decision than the
one that shreve abruptly forces upon quentin.5 milkman’s community also
provides him with more reliable sources of information, and from that community
he gets a much more solid sense of the past, in various ways, than
quentin ever can. milkman’s first confirmation comes from circe. when

dead (song 243, 248), and that someone “dumped” the elder macon’s body in
hunters cave after his original shallow grave eroded (244). susan byrd later
significantly verifies and augments this information. she confirms that the
full version of sing’s name is indeed singing bird, identifies sing’s adopted
brother (susan’s father) as crow bird, and verifies the names of jake, ryna,
and heddy. moreover, susan clears up milkman’s misconception that jake
was the only son of solomon and explains the legend of the flying african
(321–23). although one might argue that these multiple verifications also
derive from a human memory subject to the same sort of error and partiality
that quentin distrusts, morrison provides yet another level of verification in
the actual song of solomon. the song functions as an oral history, one much
more vital than any written historical record or artifact, because it continues
to live. when milkman finally discerns the significance of the son

.
just as he cannot make sense of the historical artifacts, quentin fails
to understand the full import of sutpen’s story as it concerns the need for
human connection because he dehumanizes both the players in it and the
people in his own life. morrison writes that quentin sees others as “forms
of behavior or reactions to various elements of the south” (“treatment” 28),
and elaborates that sutpen’s story “has no human value to him [quentin], 
isolation in toni morrison’s song of solomon 155
for it has become the tale not of people suffering and needing pity, but of
values and abstract ideas which have failed” (29).7 morrison works against
just this sort of dehumanization in milkman’s saga. early in song of solomon,
milkman describes his mother as “too insubstantial, too shadowy for love.”
as a result, he has never thought of her as “a person, a separate individual,
with a life apart from allowing or interfering with his own” (75). milkman’s
attitude later changes

ciprocal behavior that he displays with sweet in the bath
scene (song 285). this capacity for genuine feeling and reciprocity ultimately 
156 lorie watkins fulton
culminates in the connection that he feels to pilate at novel’s end. and morrison
gently guides her readers through a similar process by forcing them to
shed their dehumanizing tendencies as milkman sheds his. morrison spoke
to this when she said in an interview with thomas leclair, “i feel that i do
play to the gallery in song of solomon, for example, because i have to make the
reader look at people he may not wish to look at. you don’t look at pilate. you
don’t really look at a person like cholly [breedlove]” (123). however, morrison
forces her readers to look, to humanize characters they might otherwise
consider defective or even monstrous. in doing so, she extends her literary
resistance to dehumanization to her readers and forces them, as she does
milkman, to recognize the humanity of others on a level she thinks quen

ed incest
itself as an act of isolation, a “sin” by which quentin tries “to create out of
nothing a private and living hell” (32). although morrison does not explicitly
state it, this hell that quentin proposes would, of course, never end. as
such, it amounts to another of quentin’s attempts to play god by controlling
time, the metaphysical equivalent of breaking his grandfather’s watch.
milkman engages in a similar battle with time, but he fares more successfully.
he begins song of solomon existing only in the lived moment. until
he learns something of his history from his father and pilate, the future and,
by implication, the past do not exist for milkman; rather, as morrison writes,
“the present did extend itself ” (35). as milkman becomes aware of his past,
he comes to realize first that “you can’t do the past over” when his father tells
his version of the events surrounding ruth’s father’s death, how he supposedly
found ruth lying next to her father’s newly de

ad body, naked “as a yard
dog, kissing him” (76, 73). milkman becomes angry when this knowledge
of the past threatens him, for the first time, in a personal way. he seethes
with resentment because his father came to him “with some way-out tale” to
explain the high level of animosity between himself and ruth (76). in short, 
isolation in toni morrison’s song of solomon 157
milkman initially resists engaging with his past in any critical, meaningful
way, and by chapter eight, he actually runs from it when he feels the need
to “beat a path away from his parents’ past, which was also their present and
which was threatening to become his present as well” (180).
however, after circe teaches milkman how to listen and hear, and the
“shit” that weighs him down begins to fall away, milkman stops running and
begins to cultivate an understanding of his past. m

 striking back” (34), yet morrison interprets quentin’s
suicide as a hollow victory, if not an outright defeat, because it defies the
characteristics of humility and endurance that she feels faulkner’s work
espouses. quentin’s failure “to adequately expiate the guilt of his family is
faulkner’s statement that the reconciliation of man to his position is at hand
when he learns to live outside of self and within time” (35). milkman’s leap
toward guitar at the conclusion of song of solomon might, at first, seem similar
to quentin’s willful act of self-destruction; however, morrison pointedly 
158 lorie watkins fulton
constructs milkman’s leap as another submissive triumph.8 rather than
defying fate as quentin does, milkman submits to whatever consequences
his landing might hold. and readers can logically assume that milkman will
likely emerge victorious from the encounter with guitar because pilate’s
earlier prediction, “ain’t nothin goin to kill him but his own ignoran

ce” (song
140), has thus far held true. by novel’s end, milkman has overcome much of
that ignorance and has become empowered through his connection to his
african heritage. however, milkman can only obtain this power through
submission. when he takes his leap, which symbolically connects him to the
ancestral solomon, he definitively embraces this knowledge of his heritage.
that acceptance also extends the earlier lesson that milkman learned about
time to include the future. as he jumps, milkman reflects that he now knows
what solomon knew, “if you surrendered to the air, you could ride it” (337).
milkman’s ride, with all its attendant cultural and historical associations simply
must, on some level, represent his submission to whatever destiny awaits him.
his fate, though, ultimately becomes irrelevan

t because he acquires, along
with the knowledge of his past, a connection to his ancestors that renders true,
final death an impossibility according to the african religious beliefs which
inform that ancestral knowledge. like solomon, milkman will presumably
one day survive, even thrive, indefinitely as an ancestor himself. in direct
contrast to quentin’s desire to suffer eternally in a hell of his own creation,
milkman’s spirit will live on in the collective cultural memory of his family.
4
the nuclear family that surrounds milkman, however, seems highly problematic.
like many of the fathers in faulkner’s fiction, macon dead simply
cannot provide the sort of emotional support that his son requires. in her
thesis, mor

ll notes, this kind of flying involves “the ability to transcend
self and self-love” (111). pilate, then, teaches him this lesson by establishing
a connection with his past, and in her powerful role as guide, she stands in
stark opposition to macon dead.9 pilate exists as part conjure woman, part
rebel, and part original woman. like the eve of the creation story, she has
no navel, and circe further establishes that pilate “borned herself’ when she

struggled free from her dead mother’s womb after circe had given up any
hope of saving either mother or child (song 244). in keeping with morrison’s
characterization of pilate as a living embodiment of antiquity, gay wilentz
reads pilate as a traditional african ancestral figure and convincingly traces
the variety of ways that pilate embodies that tradition as a cultural custodian
(63–69), and joyce irene middleton likewise reads pilate as a “culture
bearer” in the tradition of th

from other sources. however, pilate teaches him more about how to
interact with that history than simple facts ever could. she instructs him in
the lessons about responsibility that he must learn before he can understand
both other people and his heritage, lessons she learned from her father’s
ghost when he appeared and told her, “you just can’t fly on off and leave a
body” (147). readers later discover that in this scene pilate misinterprets
jake’s lament that his own father, solomon, left him behind as a statement
about responsibility (333). however, this misunderstanding does not invalidate
the lesson that she learns.10 she takes this notion of responsibility to
heart and lives her life according to its precepts. for years, pilate drags around
the bones of a man whose death she feels accountable for (readers later learn
that they are actually her father’s bones) in homage to the debt she thinks she
owes him. this belief also extends to pilate’s relationship to society

s the brand of absolute freedom that
characterizes sula or cholly breedlove. pilate’s notions of responsibility
temper the myth of the utterly free flying african in ways that significantly
affect milkman’s understanding of his own obligation to others and to history.
wilentz shows that morrison “is quick to remind us that the man flying
away leaves people behind, most often women and their children” (72).
morrison does this, in part, by constructing pilate’s life as the antithesis to
solomon’s flight. because pilate knows that you “just can’t fly on off and leave
a body” (147), she learns to fly within her body by freeing her mind and soul.
when she dies, milkman finally realizes that he loved her because “without
ever leaving the ground, she could fly” (336). as he cradles her dying body,
milkman realizes that pilate taught him how to fly in a similar fashion by
teaching him how to appreciate and interact with his familial legacy. he
assumes control of that history and

later notices that talking about the past softens his father somehow, and
macon’s childhood becomes the subject of the first genuine conversation the
two men ever have (52). morrison may create milkman’s father in the image
of sutpen, but when the past returns to haunt macon, unlike sutpen, he
realizes that he sold out by trading human connection for respectability and
security; macon longs for the early familial affinity that he threw so carelessly

away, if only for a moment as he walks away from pilate’s window, “resisting
as best he could the sound of the voices that followed him” (28).
5
macon’s awareness of his loss makes it apparent that when viewed through
the lens of morrison’s earlier work, song of solomon marks a turning point in
her exploration of the theme of isolation. readers can see morrison working
though the problems she associates with isolation in her first two novels,
in which abusive, emotionally distant

fathers and communities simply
refuse to acknowledge the ugliness of the reality that exists in their midst.
in the bluest eye, neither an entire community nor a single family, trapped
by cholly’s domination, can save pecola breedlove. in morrison’s second
novel, the community of medallion refuses sula a similar salvation in this
life, though morrison intimates that she likely achieves it in the next one.
song of solomon finally shows readers a protagonist who becomes intimately
connected to a communal and historical knowledge and grows through that
relationship. in this novel, readers can see morrison working towards the
powerful communal saving force that will later rescue denver, and perhaps
even sethe, in beloved.
some critics, though, believe that milkman’s gender makes that growth
problematic and criticize song of solomon’s apparently careless treatment of
women.11 while women certainly do not fare we

sters, first corinthians and magdalene called lena, significantly empowers
these female characters. at the end of chapter nine, milkman attempts
to control corinthians’s sexuality in a scene highly reminiscent of the sort
of sexual control that quentin tries to establish over caddy. morrison’s thesis
interprets caddy quite passively and concludes that she “submits to the
doom without question or reflection” (25). caddy ultimately runs away from
home in the sound and the fury; in song of solomon, however, morrison offers
corinthians another option via her sister. when milkman attempts to prevent
corinthians from dating henry porter, lena comes to her rescue. lena
practically attacks milkman on her sister’s behalf, questioning, “where do
you get the right to decide our lives?” (song 215). she then assaults milkman’s
own sexuality by referring to his penis as a “little hog’s gut,” and tells him
that he has “pissed” his “last in this house,” meaning, of course, that

awpha conference, morrison said of
faulkner’s fiction, “my reasons, i think, for being interested and deeply moved by
all his subjects had something to do with my desire to find out something about
this country and that artistic articulation of its past that was not available in history,
which is what art and fiction can do but sometimes history refuses to do” (“faulkner
and women” 296). in that same speech, she went on to admire what she called 
isolation in toni morrison’s song of solomon 163
faulkner’s unique gaze, or “refusal-to-look-away approach in his writing” and his
ability to “infuriate you in such wonderful ways” (297). later, in the elissa schappell
interview, morrison praised faulkner for his “brilliant” imagining of african
american characters (100), and in an interview with thomas leclair she said,
“faulkner wrote what i suppose could be called regional literature and had it published
all over the world. it is good—and universal—because it is spe

4. this essay owes an enormous debt to alessandra vendrame’s “toni morrison:
a faulknerian novelist?” vendrame describes morrison’s thesis as both “the
most reliable source for discovering what faulknerian features most impressed her
in 1955, and the most appropriate jumping-off point for attempting to sketch out
some elements in common between their [faulkner’s and morrison’s] narratives.”
vendrame adds, “a close reading of song of solomon (1977) and of the thesis of 1955
reveals that in the novel, there is a very original revoicing of central faulknerian
motifs and themes—such as alienation, incest, and the impact of the past on the
present—which were also at the core of morrison’s argument in the faulkner chapter
of her thesis” (679).

cultural foundation from the dialogic interaction between milkman’s search for
himself and an obscure m

history seems willing to maintain uncertainties and constantly evades closure, morrison
establishes a point of intersection between the different voices in a commitment
to recover and rewrite milkman’s family history. thus, milkman dead not
only repossesses his past, but also restores its meaning through the re-actualization
of his family’s mythical heritage” (684).
6. in the neustadt interview at bryn mawr, morrison explained the significance
of solomon’s song as a personal oral history: “the song of solomon: there’s a
song like that in my family. i don’t know all the lyrics but it starts with a line like
‘green, the only son of solomon,’ and then some words i don’t understand, but it is
a genealogy” (90).
7. morrison’s thesis describes the characters in the sutpen saga as “ghosts”
which quentin has “no feeling of affinity for” (28). she then asserts that quentin
sees his own family in much the same way. caddy embodie

8. in a 1977 interview with pepsi charles, morrison classified song of solomon
as an “absolute triumph” because “a man learns the only important lesson there is to
learn. and he wins himself, be wins himself. and the quality of his life improves

10. mackethan asserts that such misunderstandings actually create meaning:
“this fluidity of language is consistent with the nature of the world. it is what gives
life its creativity, and for morrison, it is a literally lifesaving attribute of words”
(106).
11. for example, weinstein argues that, “milkman’s triumphant recovery of
solomon is ringed round with female suffering and exclusion.” he then points out
the negativity associated with the women in the text. he refers to elements such as
ruth’s exclusion from the text, hagar’s tragic death, and sweet’s function as a sexual
reward for milkman, and concludes that “something in the internal binary logic of
this text understands the saved life of a black man in terms of the yielded life of a
black woman” (122–23).

in a 1981 interview, morrison told charles ruas that “the bible wasn’t
part of my reading, it was part of my life” (97). in her use of structure, language,
and concepts—her use of metaphor, repetition, and reiteration—the
bible resonates throughout toni morrison’s novel, song of solomon. erich
auerbach describes the bible as a text “fraught with background” (qtd. in
alter, “the old testament” 22); the song of solomon is a text fraught with
the background of the bible. here, i concentrate on morrison’s use of biblical
names. the novel’s epigraph—“the fathers may soar and the children
may know their names”—signals the central role names will play in the

morrison signals her typological use of naming in the title she gives her
novel, song of solomon. controversy has surrounded the biblical book, song of
solomon, since the origins of hebrew and christian exegesis. certainly, this
is a peculiar work to find in a religious book. this explicit poem of romantic
and sexual love, placed in an idyllic setting full of vivid images of nature, never
mentions god and seems to have no religious significance. as early as 90 ce,
rabbi aqiba felt called upon to defend its place in the canon: “the whole
world is not worth the day on which the song of son

another early hebrew exegete described it as “a lock to which the key has
been lost” (qtd. in pope 101). because the literal meaning of the poem did
not fit either a jewish or a christian paradigm, religious scholars were forced
to read the poem as an allegory. some read it as an allegory of the quest for
salvation and the promised land, others as an allegory of god’s relationship

to human beings, and still others as an allegory of jesus’s relationship to the
church. try as they might, these scholars were never able to obliterate the
sensual physicality of the poem or overcome its subversive, contradictory
relationship to imposed canonical readings of the biblical text. because the
“beloved” of the poem has long been considered a black woman—“i am
black but comely”—the “song” has also been seen as god’s gift to african
american women. the title of

sees the orgasmic rhythm of sexuality that is so evident in the biblical poem as
saturating the whole novel: “the rhythm of the book has this kind of building
up, sort of in and out, explosion. there’s this beat in it . . . something in the
blood, in the body, that’s operating underneath the language” (76), the same
rhythm that operates underneath the language of the song of solomon.
by using the song of solomon as a type to frame her novel, morrison
emphasizes the central role that song, especially the song that pilate sings
at the beginning of the novel and that the children chant at the end, plays
in her story. lawrence-mcintyre argues in her essay “double meanings of
spirituals” that “slaves used bible stories to retain aspects of their traditional
religions in the form and structure of their songs” (383). to support her argument,

history is locked in milkman’s grandmother’s name sing, and in his greatgrandmother’s

and, of course, in his great-grandfather solomon’s song (“ryna”). solomon
is associated with wisdom and he was the last king of a united jewish kingdom,
a type of the new jerusalem. the song reaches outside the hebrew
and christian canons to include traditional african and islamic types.

african american type of the promised land, africa. in her integration of

morrison’s hagar in some ways evokes her biblical type more explicitly
than the novel’s ruth. the biblical hagar, like pilate’s haunted and rejected
daughter, is used sexually and then abandoned. she is the egyptian handmaid
of abraham’s wife sarah. the barren sarah, believing that, at seventy-six, she
is too old ever to provide an heir to her eighty-six-year-old husband, gives 
typology in toni morrison’s song of solomon 175
hagar to abraham as a surrogate to ensure that abraham’s family line does
not die. but once hagar is pregnant, sarah becomes jealous and, with abraham’s
complicity, forces hagar into exile in the wilderness. god intervenes
and hagar is returned to abraham and sarah, only to be abandoned once
again when sarah miraculously becomes pregnant at ninety with isaac, who
becomes abraham’s official heir and one of the great hebrew patriarchs. this
time, hagar’s abandonment is permanent, but

woman and represents the “children of promise” who, through christ, are the
rightful heirs of the new jerusalem (gal. 4.22–31). hagar and her absent son
ishmael are types of the novel’s hagar and the excluded african american
people of the united states.
in the bible, hagar is a relatively minor character and just as, for people
who know the bible, ishmael’s absence haunts the song of solomon, for those
that know the koran, the missing links of hagar’s story haunt the bible.
the koran’s hagar is a central character and her son ishmael plays a pivotal
role, much like the one isaac plays in the bible. it is ishmael, not isaac,
who escapes sacrifice at the hand of his father through divine intervention,
and he then goes on to found the ancestral line that produces the prophet
mohammed. the matriarch hagar’s triumph in the face of adversity is commemorated

subversive territory. the biblical pilate is a type of morrison’s pilate because

will set milkman free is not the truth of jesus but the truth that is “locked

of mary, who in turn is an antitype of all the powerful matriarchs of the old

by superimposing his story on the tangled narratives of all the other characters

and on the subtext of the bible, morrison is able to create a complex picture

toni morrison’s song of solomon shares with homer’s odyssey a profound
concern with naming. names are obscured, replaced, and eventually
revealed in both epic poem and novel.1 they possess a transformative power
at times: odysseus does indeed become no man, the name he uses to trick
the cyclops, when he arrives home as a nameless beggar; in morrison’s
novel the man whose name is changed to macon dead is murdered, and his
descendants transfixed in a spiritual death. names in song of solomon are

2 this, her third novel, is distinguished from much of her other
work, which explores the experience of black american women, by its focus
on a central male character, milkman dead. milkman, the son of a prosperous
slumlord in an unnamed michigan city, is set on a quest for his history
and identity that leads him back to virginia and the gullah traditions of his
ancestors. that song of solomon is structured as an archetypal heroic saga was
immediately recognized when it made its debut in the late 1970s. in an early
essay on the novel, a. leslie harris identified a mythic structure that conforms
to the male initiatory pattern. harris’ analysis was exclusively concerned with
milkman’s role as an archetypal hero whose childhood is narrated as a series
of events “resonating with symbolic and archetypal significance,”3 beginning

let us turn now to the story. like the odyssey it features a complex
narrative structure, with numerous embedded tales which fill in the past and
which even sometimes contradict one another. the protagonist, nicknamed
“milkman,” is the third in his line to carry the name of macon dead, his
father’s name, and his father’s before him. yet the first macon dead, an illiterate
ex-slave, had another name ( jake solomon), lost to his progeny, and it will
be milkman’s project to recover the name and story of his forebears. as the
second macon dead recounts, when his father registered with the freedman’s
bureau in virginia, the man behind the desk was drunk:
186 judith fletcher
he asked papa where he was born. papa said macon. then he
asked him who his father was. papa said, “he’s dead.” asked him
who owned him, papa said, “i’m free.” well, the yankee wrote it all

nd has three children: two daughters, first
corinthians and lena, and a son, milkman. spiritually annihilated by the
trauma of his father’s murder, macon dead the second is undone by his compensating
lust for money and property. his family life is sterile and repressive,
and he continues to ignore his sister. pilate’s life is more emotionally rich, but
still she experiences tragedies and sorrows directly related to the fragmentation
of family. as philip page observes: “without their name (solomon) and
the wisdom it implies, the deads are ignorant of their ancestry, and hence
of themselves, and they are alienated from their community, each other, and
themselves.”15

although he is the third man in his family to inherit the name of macon

body. the neurotic ruth, starved for intimacy

es and knowledge of women: sing, wife
of the first macon dead, determines that he will keep his name; circe and
the women of shalimar reveal the names of milkman’s ancestors. responding
to the ghost of her father (macon dead the first), pilate and her family
unknowingly enact the name of her mother. “sing, sing,” says the ghost,
and understanding his revelation to be a command, pilate and her family do
indeed sing. their song about sugarman contains the vestigial name of their
forefather, solomon or shalimar, who flew away from slavery—and family.
it will guide milkman to the truth about his origins. the song, which recurs
with variations throughout the narrative like a refrain, is first sung in the
opening chapter by a shabby and eccentrically dressed woman (presumably
pilate) who is part of the crowd watching the insurance agent’s failed attempt
to fly from the roof of mercy hospital:

pilate’s song contextualizes an apparently foolish suicide within a larger
narrative framework, the folktale of the slave who flew back to africa; her

the event corresponds with the birth of milkman, who will later hear
the song performed by his aunts and cousin, with solomon replacing sugarman,
providing the key to his patrimony. naming and narrativity are inextricably
woven together in this instance, and it is the voices of women (and
later children) who transmit this patrimony, and who contest its significance
and meaning. for milkman the tale is self-affirming and heroic, but the wise
women of shalimar read it differently. susan byrd (milkman’s great-aunt)
focuses more on ryna, solomon’s wife, and their twenty-one children, abandoned

milkman’s true name requires him to burrow through layers or distortions of
names—sugarman, charlemagne, solomon, shalimar—that also signify an
absence of narrative fixity or certitude; versions of stories change according
to who tells them.
the relationship between names and narrative is established early in the
novel by the subversive processes that bring about the designation of “not

macon and his sister pilate, as children, spent the night in a cave, he left his

sister with the corpse and three bags of gold. convinced that pilate has the
gold in a bag tied to her ceiling, he sends milkman and guitar to steal it. the
counter-narrative is told by pilate to ruth, in a story never circulated among
the men: that the sack contains rocks from different places pilate had visited,
and, as milkman finally discovers after he and guitar are picked up by the
police, human bones. but whose bones? for when the skin has melted from a

this missing name is incomplete. this search for a name and a story becomes
milkman’s quest. it is his function to fill in the spaces of the form properly,
to slide the elements of his grandfather’s history into their original positions,
and thus to discover the names of his forefathers and foremothers: jake and

of the people in denford, including macon and pilate. it is circe to whom
odysseus returns after his visit to the underworld, so in a sense she too
functions as a midwife in his rebirth. her nurturance extends to her tutelary
capacity: she not only tells odysseus that he must make his trip to hades,
but also, once he returns, explains what he must do for the remainder of
his voyage. milkman similarly learns important information from circe:

journey to his ancestral home, shalimar, a gullah town on the coast of

a linear “phallic” (to use kristeva’s terminology) temporal progression. milkman’s
experience in shalimar, the home and name of his great-grandparents,
is represented as a continued citation of the odyssey. he arrives in shalimar
without recognizing it, as odysseus does in ithaca. yet like odysseus, he has
found his true home, where he encounters hostile males (first in solomon’s
store) who insult and assault him. after his trials are over, and once he has
achieved the self-knowledge that has been his true quest, he has a romantic
affair with a penelope-like woman named sweet with whom he shares a
mutually satisfying intimacy. this refashioning of the epic poem accentuates
the initiatory aspects of milkman’s experience: his aggressive badinage with

while milkman’s experience is charted along a narrative axis that corresponds
to a male bildungsroman, there is a calculated twist in the narrative
journey. we have noted how the encounter with circe marks the landscape
as feminine, the very landscape where milkman will undergo his rite of passage
as a hunter. his initial impression of shalimar, an isolated coastal village,
emphasizes the women who

e compass of chapter 11, the remainder of the novel contests this
apparently heroic resolution. the mythic subtext is interleaved with the narratives
of hagar and guitar. as milkman is putting the pieces of his story
together, the jilted hagar dies of a broken heart. unlike him she has not successfully
completed her coming of age.26 instead she corresponds to ryna,
the woman whom milkman’s great-grandfather left behind when he flew
away, and whose story offered by susan byrd serves to devalue solomon’s
flight. it is during his visit with susan that milkman finally loses his watch;
the reader is alerted that the linear time of the bildungsroman is not what
structures this tale after all.
the second to last chapter of the novel is permeated with the voices of
women, pilate in particular, who sings a song of lamentation at her granddaughter’s
funeral. this tragic turn of events intersects with the heroic resolution
of milkman’s coming of age—and as it so often is in classical greek
lit

ure, women’s lamentation is a disruptive energy.27 moreover, as milkman
is going through his initiation process, hunting with the elders at night
and bathing in the sea with sweet, he is being stalked by the murderous
guitar. the heroic resolution and citational practices that connect his story
to european literary history are further compromised when guitar’s bullet
misses milkman and kills pilate as they are burying jake’s remains. the novel
ends with milkman’s revision of the song of solomon as he sings to pilate,
naming her as “sugargirl” and then leaping off a cliff in a reenactment of his
great-grandfather’s flight. the linear tale with its teleology of the heroic quest
is now circumscribed by a ring composition, suggesting eternal repetitions
of flight and song. we can choose to think that milkman has plunged to his

or that he has replicated the flight of his great-grandfather shalimar, and

death, for he is already dead. her name alone, singular in its homeric allusion,
denotes the male heroic pattern with its linear androcentric emphasis.
yet because she has existed in other narratives, including epics, poetry, and
