decayed from their high
estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of
men: map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers, and the agents of
obscure enterprises. one house, however, second from the corner, was
still occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great
air of wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness
except for the fan-light, mr. utterson stopped and knocked. a
well-dressed, elderly servant opened the door.

"is dr. jekyll at home, poole?" asked the lawyer.

"i will see, mr. utterson," said poole, admitting the visitor, as
he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall, paved with
flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright,
open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. "will you
wait here by the

21)

fire, sir? or shall i give you a light in the dining room?"

"here, thank you," said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on
the tall fender. this hall, in which he was now left

alone, was a
pet fancy of his friend the doctor's; and utterson himself was wont
to speak of it as the pleasantest room in london. but to-night there
was a shudder in his blood; the face of hyde sat heavy on his
memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of
life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in
the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the
uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. he was ashamed of his
relief, when poole presently returned to announce that dr. jekyll
was gone out.

"i saw mr. hyde go in by the old dissecting-room door, poole," he
said. "is that right, when dr. jekyll is from home?"

"quite right, mr. utterson, sir," replied the servant. "mr. hyde
has a key."

"your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young
man, poole," resumed the other musingly.

"yes, sir, he do indeed," said poole. "we have all orders to obey
him."

"i do not think i ever met mr. hyde?" asked

utterson.


"o, dear no, sir. he never dines here," replied the butler. "indeed
we see very little of

22)

him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and goes by the
laboratory."

"well, good-night, poole."

"good-night, mr. utterson." and the lawyer set out homeward with a
very heavy heart. "poor harry jekyll," he thought, "my mind
misgives me he is in deep waters! he was wild when he was young; a
long while ago to be sure; but in the law of god, there is no
statute of limitations. ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old
sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, pede
claudo, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the
fault." and the lawyer, scar

had only seen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had
never been photographed; and the few who could describe him differed
widely, as common observers will. only on one point, were they
agreed; and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity
with which the fugitive impressed his beholders.

                     incident of the letter

it was late in the afternoon, when mr. utterson found his way to
dr. jekyll's door, where he was at once admitted by poole, and
carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had
once been a garden, to the building which was indifferently known
as the laboratory or the dissecting-rooms. the doctor had bought
the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and his own
tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the
destination of the block at the bottom of the garden. it was the
first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his
friend's quarters; and he eyed the di

ses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and a
business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty
windows barred with iron. a fire burned in the grate; a lamp was
set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog
began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat dr.
jekyll, looking deadly sick. he did not rise to meet his visitor,
but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice.

"and now," said mr. utterson, as soon as poole had left them, "you
have heard the news?"

the doctor shuddered. "they were crying it in the square," he said.
"i heard them in my dining-room."

"one word," said the lawyer. "carew was my client, but so are you,
and i want to know what i am doing. you have not been mad enough to
hide this fellow?"

"utterson, i swear to god," cried the doctor, "i swear to god i
will never set eyes on him again. i bind my honour to you that i am
done with him in this world. it is all at an end. and

aintness: he shut his
mouth tight and nodded.

"i knew it," said utterson. "he meant to murder you. you have had a
fine escape."

"i have had what is far more to the purpose," returned the doctor
solemnly: "i have had a lesson--o god, utterson, what a lesson i
have had!" and he covered his face for a moment with his hands.

on his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with
poole. "by the by," said he, "there was a letter handed in to-day:
what was the messenger like?" but poole was positive nothing had
come except by post; "and only circulars by that," he added.

this news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. plainly the
letter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had
been

39)

written in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently
judged, and handled with the more caution. the newsboys, as he went,
were crying themselves hoarse along the footways: "special edition.

and to disperse the fogs of london. insensibly the lawyer melted.
there was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than mr. guest;
and he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant. guest
had often been on business to the doctor's; he knew poole; he could
scarce have failed to hear of mr. hyde's familiarity about the
house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as well, then, that he
should see a letter which put that mystery to rights? and above all
since guest, being a great student and critic of handwriting, would
consider the step natural and obliging? the clerk, besides, was a
man of counsel; he would scarce read so strange a document without
dropping a remark; and by that remark mr. utterson might shape his
future course.

n air, he did good; his face seemed to
open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service;
and for more than two months, the doctor was at peace.

on the 8th of january utterson had dined at the doctor's with a
small party; lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had
looked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio were
inseparable friends. on the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door
was shut against the lawyer. "the doctor was confined to the
house," poole said, "and saw no one." on the 15th, he tried again,
and was again refused; and having now been used for the last two
months to see his friend almost daily, he found this return of
solitude to weigh upon his spirits. the fifth night he had in guest
to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to dr. lanyon's.

there at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in,
he was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor's
appearance. he had his death-warrant writ

obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his
private safe.

it is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and
it may be doubted if, from that day forth, utterson desired the
society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. he
thought of him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and
fearful. he went to call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to
be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to
speak with poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air and
sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that
house of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its
inscrutable recluse. poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to
communicate. the doctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined
himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would
sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very
silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his
mind.

y there were still some
stirrings of life, that mr. utterson at last turned and looked at
his companion. they were both pale; and there was an answering
horror in their eyes.

"god forgive us, god forgive us," said mr. utterson.

but mr. enfield only nodded his head very seriously and walked on
once more in silence.

                             the last night

mr. utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after
dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from poole.

"bless me, poole, what brings you here?" he cried; and then
taking a second look at him, "what ails you?" he added; "is the
doctor ill?"

"mr. utterson," said the man, "there is something wrong."


"take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you," said the
lawyer. "now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want."

"you know the doctor's ways, sir," replied poole, "and how he
shuts himself up. well, he's shut up again in the cabinet; and i
don't like it, sir--i wish i m

ay die if i like it. mr. utterson,
sir, i'm afraid."

"now, my good man," said the lawyer, "be explicit. what are you
afraid of?"

"i've been afraid for about a week," returned poole, doggedly
disregarding the question, "and i can bear it no more."

the man's appearance amply bore out his

52)

words; his manner was altered for the worse; and except for the
moment when he had first announced his terror, he had not once
looked the lawyer in the face. even now, he sat with the glass of
wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed to a corner of
the floor. "i can bear it no more," he repeated.

"come," said the lawyer, "i see you have some good reason, poole;

i see there is something seriously amiss. try to tell me what it
is."

"i think there's been foul play," said poole, hoarsely.


"foul play!" cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather
inclined to be irritated in consequence. "what foul play? what
does the man mean?"

"i daren't say, sir," was the answer; "but will you come along
with me and see for yourself?"

mr. utterson's only answer was to rise and get his hat and
great-coat; but he observed with wonder the greatness of the
relief that appeared upon the butler's face, and perhaps with no
less, that the wine was still untasted when

 who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled
up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting
weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red
pocket-handkerchief. but for all the hurry of his coming, these
were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the
moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and
his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.

"well, sir," he said, "here we are, and god grant there be
nothing wrong."

"amen, poole," said the lawyer.

thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door
was opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, "is that
you, poole?"

"it's all right," said poole. "open the door." the hall, when
they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was built
high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and

54)

women, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. at the sight
of mr. utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering;

and the cook, crying out, "bless god! it's mr. utterson," ran
forward as if to take him in her arms.

"what, what? are you all here?" said the lawyer peevishly. "very
irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased."

"they're all afraid," said poole.

blank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted
up her voice and now wept loudly.

"hold your tongue!" poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent
that testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the
girl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had
all started and turned toward the inner door with faces of
dreadful expectation. "and now," continued the butler, addressing
the knife-boy, "reach me a candle, and we'll get this through
hands at once." and then he begged mr. utterson to follow him,
and led the way to the back-garden.

"now, sir," said he, "you come as g
 
 ___________________________
 
ently as you can. i want you
to hear, and i don't want you to be heard. and see here, sir, if
by any chance he was to ask you in, don't go."

mr. utterson's nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a
jerk that nearly threw him from his balance; but he re-collected
his courage

55)

and followed the butler into the laboratory building and through
the surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to
the foot of the stair. here poole motioned him to stand on one
side and listen; while he himself, setting down the candle and
making a great and obvious call on his resolution, mounted the
steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize
of the cabinet door.

"mr. utterson, sir, asking to see you," he called; and even as he
did so, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.

a voice answered from within: "tell him i cannot see any one," it
said complainingly.

"thank you, sir," said poole

 voice?"

"it seems much changed," replied the lawyer, very pale, but
giving look for look.

"changed? well, yes, i think so," said the butler. "have i been
twenty years in this man's house, to be deceived about his voice?
no, sir; master's made away with; he was made, away with eight
days ago, when we heard him cry out upon the name of god; and
who's in there instead of him, and why it stays there, is a thing
that cries to heaven, mr. utterson!"

56)

"this is a very strange tale, poole; this is rather a wild tale,
my man," said mr. utterson, biting his finger. "suppose it were
as you suppose, supposing dr. jekyll to have been--well,
murdered, what could induce the murderer to stay? that won't hold
water; it doesn't commend itself to reason."

"well, mr. utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but i'll do
it yet," said poole. "all this last week (you must know) him, or
it, or whatever it is that lives in that cabinet, has been crying

the importance of this to dr. j. can hardly be exaggerated." so
far the letter had run composedly enough, but here with a sudden
splutter of the pen, the writer's emotion had broken loose. "for
god's sake," he had added, "find me some of the old."

"this is a strange note," said mr. utterson; and then sharply,
"how do you come to have it open?"

"the man at maw's was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me
like so much dirt," returned poole.

"this is unquestionably the doctor's hand, do you know?" resumed
the lawyer.

"i thought it looked like it," said the servant rather sulkily;
and then, with another voice, "but what matters hand-of-write?"
he said. "i've seen him!"

"seen him?" repeated mr. utterson. "well?"

"that's it!" said poole. "it was this way. i came suddenly into
the theatre from the

garden. it seems he had slipped out to look for this drug or
whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and

cry out like a rat, and run from me? i have served him long
enough. and then..." the man paused and passed his hand over his
face.

"these are all very strange circumstances," said mr. utterson,
"but i think i begin to see daylight. your master, poole, is
plainly seized with one of those maladies that both torture and
deform the sufferer; hence, for aught i know, the alteration of
his voice; hence the mask and the avoidance of his friends; hence
his eagerness to find this drug, by means of which the poor soul
retains some hope of ultimate recovery--god grant that he be
not deceived! there is my explanation; it is sad enough, poole,
ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain and natural, hangs
well together, and delivers us from a

"that thing was not my master, and there's the truth. my master"

utterson attempted to protest. "o, sir," cried poole, "do you
think i do not know my master after twenty years? do you think i
do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door, where i
saw him every morning of my life? no, sir, that thing in the mask
was never dr. jekyll--god knows what it was, but it was never
dr. jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was
murder done."

"poole," replied the lawyer, "if you say that, it will become my
duty to make certain. much as i desire to spare your master's
feelings, much as i

am puzzled by this note which seems to prove
him to be still alive, i shall consider it my duty to break in
that door."

"ah mr. utterson, that's talking!" cried the butler.

"and now comes the second question," resumed utterson: "who is
going to do it?"

"why, you and me," was the undaunted reply.

"that's very well said," returned the lawyer; "and whatever comes
of it, i shall make it my business to see you are no loser."

"there is an axe in the theatre," continued poole; "and you might
take the kitchen poker for yourself."

the lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand,
and balanced it. "do you know, poole," he said, looking up, "that

you and i are about to place ourselves in a position of some
peril?"

"you may say so, sir, indeed," returned the butler.

"yes," said the lawyer, "i once spoke with him."

"then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was
something queer about that gentleman--something that gave a man
a turn--i don't know rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this:
that you felt it in your marrow kind of cold and thin."

"i own i felt something of what you describe," said mr. utterson.

"quite so, sir," returned poole. "well, when

that masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicals
and whipped into the cabinet, it went down my spine like ice. oh,
i know it's not evidence, mr. utterson. i'm book-learned enough
for that; but a man has his feelings, and i give you my
bible-word it was mr. hyde!"

"ay, ay," said the lawyer. "my fears incline to the same point.

connection. ay, truly, i believe you; i believe poor harry is

the footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.


"pull yourself together, bradshaw," said the lawyer. "this
suspense, i know, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our
intention to make an end of it. poole, here, and i are going to
force our way into the cabinet. if all is well, my shoulders are
broad enough to bear the blame. meanwhile, lest anything should
really be amiss, or any malefactor seek to escape by the back,
you and the boy must go round the corner with a pair of good
sticks and take your post at the laboratory door. we give you ten
minutes to get to your stations."

as bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. "and now,

 the scud had banked over the moon, and it was now quite
dark. the wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that
deep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro
about their steps, until they came into the shelter of the
theatre, where they sat down silently to wait. london hummed
solemnly all around; but nearer at hand, the stillness was only
broken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along the
cabinet floor.

"so it will walk all day, sir," whispered poole; "ay, and the
better part of the night. only when a new sample comes from the
chemist, there's a bit of a break. ah, it's an ill conscience
that's such an enemy to rest! ah, sir, there's blood foully shed
in every step of it! but hark again, a little closer--put your
heart in your ears, mr. utterson, and tell me, is that the
doctor's foot?"

the steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all
they went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy
creaking tread of hen

anything else?" he asked.

poole nodded. "once," he said. "once i heard it weeping!"

"weeping? how that?" said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill
of horror.

"weeping like a woman or a lost soul," said

63)

the butler. "i came away with that upon my heart, that i could
have wept too."

but now the ten minutes drew to an end. poole disinterred the axe
from under a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the
nearest table to light them to the attack; and they drew near
with bated breath to where that patient foot was still going up
and down, up and down, in the quiet of the night.

"jekyll," cried utterson, with a loud voice, "i demand to see
you." he paused a moment, but there came no reply. "i give you
fair warning, our suspicions are aroused, and i must and shall
see you," he resumed; "if not by fair me

"utterson," said the voice, "for god's sake, have mercy!"


"ah, that's not jekyll's voice--it's hyde's!" cried utterson.
"down with the door, poole!"

poole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the
building, and the red baize door leaped against the lock and
hinges. a dismal screech, as of mere animal terror, rang from the
cabinet. up went the axe again, and again the panels crashed and
the frame bounded; four times the blow fell; but the wood was
tough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship; and it was
not until the fifth, that the lock burst in sunder and the wreck
of the door fell inwards on the carpet.

poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. "he must be buried
here," he said, hearkening to the sound.

"or he may have fled," said utterson, and he turned to examine
the door in the by-street. it was locked; and lying near by on
the flags, they found the key, already stained with rust.

"this does not look like use," observed the lawyer.

"use!" echoed poole. "do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as
if a man had stamped on it."

"ay," continued utterson, "and the fractures, too, are rusty."
the two men looked at each other with a scare. "this is beyond

next, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers
came to the cheval glass, into whose depths they looked with an
involuntary horror. but it was so turned as to show them nothing
but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a
hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and
their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in.

"this glass have seen some strange things, sir," whispered poole.

"and surely none stranger than itself," echoed the lawyer in the
same tones. "for what did jekyll"--he caught himself up at the
word with a start, and then conquering the weakness--"what
could jekyll want with it?" he said.

"you may say that!" said poole. next they turned to the
business-table. on the desk among the neat array of papers, a
large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor's hand, the
name of mr. utterson. the lawyer unsealed it, and several
enclosures fell to

the floor. the first was a will, drawn in the
same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months
before, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of
gift in case of disappearance; but, in place of the name of
edward hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement, read the
name of gabriel john utterson. he looked at poole, and then back
at the paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched
upon the carpet.

"my head goes round," he said. "he has been all these days in
possession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see
himself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document."

he caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor's

dire catastrophe."

"why don't you read it, sir?" asked poole.

"because i fear," replied the lawyer solemnly. "god grant i have
no cause for it!" and with that he brought the paper to his eyes
and read as follows:


"my dear utterson,--when this shall fall into your hands, i
shall have disappeared, under what circumstances i have not the
penetration to foresee, but my instinct and all the circumstances
of my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must be
early. go then, and first read the narrative which lanyon warned

the lawyer put it in his pocket. "i would say nothing of this
paper. if your master has fled or is dead, we may at least save
his credit. it is now ten; i must go home and read these
documents in quiet; but i shall be back before midnight, when we
shall send for the police."

presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private
room, and brought me wherewithal to write. hyde in danger of his
life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger,
strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. yet the
creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the
will; composed his two important letters, one to lanyon and one
to poole; and that he might receive actual evidence of their
being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be
registered.

thenceforward, he sat all day over the fire in the private room,
gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears,
the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the
night was fully come, he set forth in the corner of a closed cab,
and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. he, i

years, but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which
has finally severed me from my own face and nature. my provision
of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the
first experiment, began to run low. i sent out for a fresh
supply, and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the
first change of colour, not the second; i drank it and it was
without efficiency. you will learn from poole how i have had
london ransacked; it was in vain; and i am now persuaded that my
first supply was impure, and that it was that unknown impurity
which lent efficacy to the draught.
