[CHARACTER] 
rand has little sympathy for the rise and fall of peter
keating. keating starts off as a young and attractive architecture
student, and although he is clearly roark's inferior, their lives
and careers advance in parallel fashion. by the novel's end, however,
keating is a weak and alcoholic nobody, the exact fate once reserved
for talented men like henry cameron. whereas cameron suffers because of
others, however, keating is a victim of his own mistakes. unlike wynand,
who suffers for turning his back on his own potential, keating is
born mediocre and weak and never had a chance at greatness. instead,
keating suffers for denying his own mediocrity and for thinking
himself too good for a modest but happy life. in the fountainhead, character
determines fate, and the moment keating becomes dishonest as well
as weak, he dooms himself to unhappiness.
