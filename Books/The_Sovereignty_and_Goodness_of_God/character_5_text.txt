 so close unto my spirit, that it was easy for me to see how
righteous it was with god to cut off the thread of my life and cast me
out of his presence forever. yet the lord still showed mercy to me, and
upheld me; and as he wounded me with one hand, so he healed me with the
other. this day there came to me one robert pepper (a man belonging
to roxbury) who was taken in captain beers's fight, and had been now a
considerable time with the indians; and up with them almost as far as
albany, to see king philip, as he told me, and was now very lately come
into these parts. hearing, i say, that i was in this indian town, he
obtained leave to come and see me. he told me he himself was wounded in
the leg at captain beer's fight; and was not able some time to go, but
as they carried him, and as he took oaken leaves and laid to his wound,
and through the blessing of god he was able to travel again. then i took
oaken leaves and laid to my side, and with the blessing of god it cured
me also; yet before the c

is changed; i must and could lie down by my dead babe, side by side all
the night after. i have thought since of the wonderful goodness of
god to me in preserving me in the use of my reason and senses in that
distressed time, that i did not use wicked and violent means to end my
own miserable life. in the morning, when they understood that my child
was dead they sent for me home to my master's wigwam (by my master in
this writing, must be understood quinnapin, who was a sagamore, and
married king philip's wife's sister; not that he first took me, but i
was sold to him by another narragansett indian, who took me when first i
came out of the garrison). i went to take up my dead child in my arms to
carry it with me, but they bid me let it alone; there was no resisting,
but go i must and leave it. when i had been at my master's wigwam, i
took the first opportunity i could get to go look after my dead child.
when i came i asked them what they had done with it; then they told me
it was upon the hill

y from me, so that i was fain to take the rest and eat it as it was,
with the blood about my mouth, and yet a savory bit it was to me:
"for to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet." a solemn sight
methought it was, to see fields of wheat and indian corn forsaken and
spoiled and the remainders of them to be food for our merciless enemies.
that night we had a mess of wheat for our supper.




the eighth remove

on the morrow morning we must go over the river, i.e. connecticut, to
meet with king philip. two canoes full they had carried over; the next
turn i myself was to go. but as my foot was upon the canoe to step in
there was a sudden outcry among them, and i must step back, and instead
of going over the river, i must go four or five miles up the river
farther northward. some of the indians ran one way, and some another.
the cause of this rout was, as i thought, their espying some english
scouts, who were thereabout. in this travel up the river about noon the
company made a stop, and sat d

astonished. but now i may say as psalm 137.1, "by the rivers of babylon,
there we sate down: yea, we wept when we remembered zion." there one
of them asked me why i wept. i could hardly tell what to say: yet i
answered, they would kill me. "no," said he, "none will hurt you." then
came one of them and gave me two spoonfuls of meal to comfort me, and
another gave me half a pint of peas; which was more worth than many
bushels at another time. then i went to see king philip. he bade me
come in and sit down, and asked me whether i would smoke it (a usual
compliment nowadays amongst saints and sinners) but this no way suited
me. for though i had formerly used tobacco, yet i had left it ever since
i was first taken. it seems to be a bait the devil lays to make men
lose their precious time. i remember with shame how formerly, when i
had taken two or three pipes, i was presently ready for another, such a
bewitching thing it is. but i thank god, he has now given me powe
