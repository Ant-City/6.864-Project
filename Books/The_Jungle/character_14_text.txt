inds.” “tommy” hinds,
as he was known to his intimates, was a squat little man, with broad
shoulders and a florid face, decorated with gray side whiskers.
he was the kindest-hearted man that ever lived, and the
liveliest--inexhaustible in his enthusiasm, and talking socialism all
day and all night. he was a great fellow to jolly along a crowd, and
would keep a meeting in an uproar; when once he got really waked up, the
torrent of his eloquence could be compared with nothing save niagara.

tommy hinds had begun life as a blacksmith’s helper, and had run away
to join the union army, where he had made his first acquaintance with
“graft,” in the shape of rotten muskets and shoddy blankets. to a
musket that broke in a crisis he always attributed the death of his only
brother, and upon worthless blankets he blamed all the agonies of his
own old age. whenever it rained, the rheumatism would get into his
joints, and then he would screw up his face and mutter: “capitalism, my
boy, capitalism

! ‘ecrasez l’infame!’” he had one unfailing remedy for
all the evils of this world, and he preached it to every one; no matter
whether the person’s trouble was failure in business, or dyspepsia, or
a quarrelsome mother-in-law, a twinkle would come into his eyes and he
would say, “you know what to do about it--vote the socialist ticket!”

tommy hinds had set out upon the trail of the octopus as soon as the war
was over. he had gone into business, and found himself in competition
with the fortunes of those who had been stealing while he had been
fighting. the city government was in their hands and the railroads were
in league with them, and honest business was driven to the wall; and
so hinds had put all his savings into chicago real estate, and set out
singlehanded to dam the river of graft. he had been a reform member
of the city council,

ved to convince him that the power of concentrated wealth could
never be controlled, but could only be destroyed. he had published a
pamphlet about it, and set out to organize a party of his own, when a
stray socialist leaflet had revealed to him that others had been
ahead of him. now for eight years he had been fighting for the
party, anywhere, everywhere--whether it was a g.a.r. reunion, or a
hotel-keepers’ convention, or an afro-american business-men’s banquet, or
a bible society picnic, tommy hinds would manage to get himself invited
to explain the relations of socialism to the subject in hand. after that
he would start off upon a tour of his own, ending at some place between
new york and oregon; and when he came back from there, he would go out
to organize new locals for the state committee; and finally he would
come home to rest--and talk socialism in chicago. hinds’s hotel was a
very hot-bed of the propaganda; all the employees were party men, and if
they were not when they came, the

y were quite certain to be before they
went away. the proprietor would get into a discussion with some one in
the lobby, and as the conversation grew animated, others would gather
about to listen, until finally every one in the place would be crowded
into a group, and a regular debate would be under way. this went on
every night--when tommy hinds was not there to do it, his clerk did it;
and when his clerk was away campaigning, the assistant attended to it,
while mrs. hinds sat behind the desk and did the work. the clerk was an
old crony of the proprietor’s, an awkward, rawboned giant of a man, with
a lean, sallow face, a broad mouth, and whiskers under his chin,
the very type and body of a prairie farmer. he had been that all his
life--he had fought the railroads in kansas for fifty years, a granger,
a farmers’ alliance man, a “m

 the hotel had become a
favorite stopping place for western cattlemen. now that the beef trust
had adopted the trick of raising prices to induce enormous shipments of
cattle, and then dropping them again and scooping in all they needed,
a stock raiser was very apt to find himself in chicago without money
enough to pay his freight bill; and so he had to go to a cheap hotel,
and it was no drawback to him if there was an agitator talking in the
lobby. these western fellows were just “meat” for tommy hinds--he
would get a dozen of them around him and paint little pictures of “the
system.” of course, it was not a week before he had heard jurgis’s
story, and after that he would not have let his new porter go for the
world. “see here,” he would say, in the middle of an argument, “i’ve got
a fellow right here in my place who’s worked there and seen every bit of
it!” and then jurgis would drop his work, whatever it was, and come, and
the other would say, “comrade jurgis, just tell

nd it was like pulling teeth to get him to talk; but
gradually he found out what was wanted, and in the end he learned to
stand up and speak his piece with enthusiasm. his employer would sit by
and encourage him with exclamations and shakes of the head; when jurgis
would give the formula for “potted ham,” or tell about the condemned
hogs that were dropped into the “destructors” at the top and immediately
taken out again at the bottom, to be shipped into another state and made
into lard, tommy hinds would bang his knee and cry, “do you think a man
could make up a thing like that out of his head?”

and then the hotel-keeper would go on to show how the socialists had the
only real remedy for such evils, how they alone “meant business” with
the beef trust. and when, in answer to this, the victim would say that
the whole country was getting stirred up, that the newspapers were full
of denunciations of it, and the government taking action against it,
tommy hinds had a knock-out blow all

nd never dream that it is really the grand
climax of the century-long battle of commercial competition--the final
death grapple between the chiefs of the beef trust and ‘standard oil,’
for the prize of the mastery and ownership of the united states of
america!”


such was the new home in which jurgis lived and worked, and in which his
education was completed. perhaps you would imagine that he did not do
much work there, but that would be a great mistake. he would have cut
off one hand for tommy hinds; and to keep hinds’s hotel a thing of
beauty was his joy in life. that he had a score of socialist arguments
chasing through his brain in the meantime did not interfere with
this; on the contrary, jurgis scrubbed the spittoons and polished
the banisters all the more vehemently because at the same time he was
wrestling inwardly with an imaginary recalcitrant. it would be pleasant
to record that he swore off drinking immediately, and all the rest
of his bad habits with it; but that would hardly
