honest! good fellow, what's that; if it be a day fits you, search
out of the calendar, and nobody

not well.

first fisherman.
why, i'll tell you: this is called pentapolis, and our king the
good simonides.

pericles.
the good king simonides, do you call him?

first fisherman.
ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for his peaceable reign
and good government.

pericles.
he is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects the name of
good government.  how far is his court distant from this shore?

first fisherman.
marry sir, half a day's journey: and i'll tell you, he hath a
fair daughter, and to-morrow is her birth-day; and there are
princes and knights come from all parts of t

we'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a

pericles.
then honour be but a goal to my will,
this day i'll rise, or else add ill to ill.

scene ii. the same. a public way, or platform leading to the
lists.  a pavilion by the side of it for the reception of the
king, princess, lords, etc.

simonides.
are the knights ready to begin the triumph?

first lord.
they are, my liege;
and stay your coming to present themselves.

simonides.
return them, we are ready; and our daughter,
in honour of whose birth these triumphs are,
sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat
for men to see, and seeing wonder at.

simonides.
it's

 fit it should be so; for princes are
a model, which heaven makes like to itself:
as jewels lose their glory if neglected,
so princes their renowns if not respected.
'tis now your honour, daughter, to explain
the labour of each knight in his device.

thaliard.
which, to preserve mine honour, i'll perform.

[enter a knight; he passes over, and his squire presents his
shield to the princess.]

simonides.
who is the first that doth prefer himself?

thaliard.
a knight of sparta, my renowned father;
and the device he bears upon his shield
is a black ethiope reaching at the sun:
the word, 'lux tua vita mihi.'

simonides.
he loves you well that holds his life of you.

[the second knight passes over.]

who is the second that presents himself?

thaliard.
a prince of macedon, my royal father;
and the device he bears upon his shield
is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;
the

 motto thus, in spanish, 'piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'

[the third knight passes over.]

simonides.
and what's the third?

thaliard.
the third of antioch;
and his device, a wreath of chivalry;
the word, 'me pompae provexit apex.'

[the fourth knight passes over.]

simonides.
what is the fourth?

thaliard.
a burning torch that's turned upside down;
the word, 'quod me alit, me extinguit.'

simonides.
which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
which can as well inflame as it can kill.

[the fifth knight passes over.]

thaliard.
the fifth, an hand environed with clouds,
holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
the motto thus, 'sic spectanda fides.'

[the sixith knight, pericles, passes over.]

simonides.
and what's
the sixth and last, the which the knight himself
with such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?

thaliard.
he seems to be a stranger; but his present is

a wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
the motto, 'in hac spe vivo.'

simonides.
a pretty moral;
from the dejected state wherein he is,
he hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.

first lord.
he had need mean better than his outward show
can any way speak in his just commend;
for by his rusty outside he appears
to have practised more the whipstock than the lance.

second lord.
he well may be a stranger, for he comes
to an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.

third lord.
and on set purpose let his armour rust
until this day, to scour it in the dust.

simonides.
knights,
to say you're welcome were superfluous.
to place upon the volume of your deeds,
as in a title-page, your worth in arms,
were more than you expect, or more than's fit,
since every worth in show commends itself.
prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:
you are princes and my guests.

thaisa.
but you, my knight and guest;
to whom this wreath of victory i give,
and crown you king of this day's happiness.

pericles.
'tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.

to me, my father?

simonides.
o attend, my daughter:
princes in this should live like god's above,
who freely give to every one that comes
to honour them:
and princes not doing so are like to gnats,
which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.
therefore to make his entrance more sweet,

pericles.
i thank him.

pericles.
i thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.

thaisa.
and further he desires to know of you,
of whence you are, your name and parentage.

pericles.

who, looking for

and after shipwreck driven upon this shore.

thaisa.
he thanks your grace; names himself pericles,
a gentleman of tyre,
who only by misfortune of the seas
bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.

simonides.
now, by the gods, i pity his misfortune,
and will awake him from his melancholy.
come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
and waste the time, which looks for other revels.
even in your armours, as you are address'd,
will very well become a soldier's dance.
i will not have excuse, with saying this,
loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads
since they love men in arms as well as beds.

[the knights dance.]

so, this was well ask'd, 'twas so well perform'd.

but bent all offices to honour her.

pericles.
by the gods, i have not:
never did thought of mine levy offence;
nor never did my actions yet commence

that calls me traitor, i return the lie.

my actions are  as noble as my thoughts,
