Ivan Petrovich Voynitsky (Vanya) (ivan/vanya petrovich vaynitsky)  - 
      The hero of the play, Vanya (a nickname for "Ivan" that is analogous to "Jack" or "Johnny" in English) is a bitter, broken man who has wasted his life toiling on the estate of his brother-in-law, Serebryakov. He is consumed with his lost life and obsessed with what might have been--a prime object of this obsession being the elusive Yelena. He functions as the play's misanthrope, offering a number of humorous caricatures of those around him. He is thus privileged with a certain bitter insight even as his friends and acquaintances dismiss him.
