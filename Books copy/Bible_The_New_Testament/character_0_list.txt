Jesus of Nazareth - 
The central figure of the New Testament, whose life,
death, and resurrection are chronicled in the books. The four Gospels
describe Jesus's life until his resurrection, and the remainder of
the New Testament concerns itself with the community of followers
of Jesus that steadily grows after his death.
