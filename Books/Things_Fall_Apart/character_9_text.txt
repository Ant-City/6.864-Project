before. as soon as the
two boys closed in, one of them did something which no one could
describe because it had been as quick as a flash. and the other boy
was flat on his back. the crowd roared and clapped and for a while
drowned the frenzied drums. okonkwo sprang to his feet and
quickly sat down again. three young men from the victorious
boy's team ran forward, carried him shoulder high and danced
through the cheering crowd. everybody soon knew who the boy
was. his name was maduka, the son of obierika.

the drummers stopped for a brief rest before the real matches.
their bodies shone with sweat, and they took up fans and began to
fan themselves. they also drank water from small pots and ate kola
nuts. they became ordinary human beings again, talking and
laughing among themselves and with others who stood near them.
the air, which had been stretched taut with excitement, relaxed
again. it was as if water had been poured on the tightened skin of a
drum. many people looked around, perhaps for t

it on the very day the locusts came, when he had worked on one
side of the wall and ikemefuna and nwoye on the other.

"when did you become a shivering old woman," okonkwo asked
himself, "you, who are known in all the nine villages for your valor
in war? how can a man who has killed five men in battle fall to
pieces because he has added a boy to their number? okonkwo, you
have become a woman indeed."

he sprang to his feet, hung his goatskin bag on his shoulder and
went to visit his friend, obierika.

obierika was sitting outside under the shade of an orange tree
making thatches from leaves of the raffia-palm. he exchanged
greetings with okonkwo and led the way into his obi.

"i was coming over to see you as soon as i finished that thatch," he
said, rubbing off the grains of sand that clung to his thighs.

"is it well?" okonkwo asked.

"yes," replied obierika. "my daughter's suitor is coming today and
i hope we will clinch the matter of the bride-price. i want you to be
there."

just then

obierika's son, maduka, came into the obi from outside,
greeted okonkwo and turned towards the compound,



"come and shake hands with me," okonkwo said to the lad. "your
wrestling the other day gave me much happiness." the boy smiled,
shook hands with okonkwo and went into the compound.



"he will do great things," okonkwo said. "if i had a son like him i
should be happy. i am worried about nwoye. a bowl of pounded
yams can throw him in a wrestling match. his two younger
brothers are more promising.

but i can tell you, obierika, that my
children do not resemble me. where are the young suckers that
will grow when the old banana tree dies? if ezinma had been a boy
i would have been happier. she has the right spirit."

"you worry yourself for nothing," said obierika. "the children are
still very young."

"nwoye is old enough to impregnate a woman. at his age i was
already fending for myself. no, my friend, he is not too young. a
chick that will grow into a cock can be spotted the very day it
hatches. i have done my best to make nwoye grow into a man, but
there is too much of his mother in him."

"too much of his grandfather," obierika thought, but he did not
say it. the same thought also came to okonkwo's mind. but he had
long learned how to lay that ghost

. whenever the thought of his
father's weakness and failure troubled him he expelled it by
thinking about his own strength and success. and so he did now.
his mind went to his latest show of manliness.

"i cannot understand why you refused to come with us to kill that
boy," he asked obierika.

"because i did not want to," obierika replied sharply. "i had
something better to do."

"you sound as if you question the authority and the decision of the
oracle, who said he should die."




"i do not. why should i? but the oracle did not ask me to carry out
its decision."

"but someone had to do it. if we were all afraid of blood, it would
not be done. and what do you think the oracle would do then?"

"you know very well, okonkwo, that i am not afraid of blood  and
if anyone tells you that i am, he is telling a lie. and let me

tell you
one thing, my friend. if i were you i would have stayed at home.
what you have done will not please the earth. it is the kind of
action for which the goddess wipes out whole families."

"the earth cannot punish me for obeying her messenger,"
okonkwo said. "a child's fingers are not scalded by a piece of hot
yam which its mother puts into its palm."

"that is true," obierika agreed. "but if the oracle said that my son
should be killed i would neither dispute it nor be the one to do it."

they would have gone on arguing had ofoedu not come in just
then. it was clear from his twinkling eyes that he had important
news. but it would be impolite to rush him. obierika offered him a
lobe of the kola nut he had broken with okonkwo. ofoedu ate
slowly and talked about the locusts. when he finished his kola nut
he said:

"the things that happen these days are very strange."


 
 ___________________________
 
"what has happened?" asked okonkwo.

"do you know ogbuefi ndulue?" ofoedu asked.

"ogbuefi ndulue of ire village," okonkwo and obierika said
together.

"he died this morning," said ofoedu.



"that is not strange. he was the oldest man in ire," said obierika.



"you are right," ofoedu agreed. "but you ought to ask why the
drum has not beaten to tell umuofia of his death."

"why?" asked obierika and okonkwo together.

"that is the strange part of it. you know his first wife who walks
with a stick?"

"yes. she is called ozoemena."

"that is so," said ofoedu. "ozoemena was, as you know, too old to
attend ndulue during his illness. his younger wives did that. when
he died this morning, one of these women went to ozoemena's hut
and told her. she rose from her mat, took her stick and walked over
to the obi. she knelt on her knees and hands at the threshold and
called her husband, who was la
 
 ___________________________
 
id on a mat. 'ogbuefi ndulue,' she
called, three times, and went back to her hut. when the youngest
wife went to call her again to be present at the washing of the body,
she found her lying on the mat, dead."

"that is very strange, indeed," said okonkwo. "they will put off
ndulue's funeral until his wife has been buried."

"that is why the drum has not been beaten to tell umuofla."

"it was always said that ndulue and ozoemena had one mind,"
said obierika. "i remember when i was a young boy there was a
song about them. he could not do anything without telling her."

"i did not know that," said okonkwo. "i thought he was a strong
man in his youth."

"he was indeed," said ofoedu.

okonkwo shook his head doubtfully.



"he led umuofia to war in those days," said obierika.



okonkwo was beginning to feel like his old self again. all that he
required was something to occupy his mind. if he had killed
ikemefuna during the busy planting season or har
 
 ___________________________
 
vesting it would
not have been so bad, his mind would have been centered on his
work. okonkwo was not a man of thought but of action. but in
absence of work, talking was the next best.

soon after ofoedu left, okonkwo took up his goatskin bag to go.

"i must go home to tap my palm trees for the afternoon," he said.

"who taps your tall trees for you?" asked obierika.

"umezulike," replied okonkwo.

"sometimes i wish i had not taken the ozo title," said obierika. "it
wounds my heart to see these young men killing palm trees in the
name of tapping."

"it is so indeed," okonkwo agreed. "but the law of the land must
be obeyed."

"i don't know how we got that law," said obierika. "in many other
clans a man of title is not forbidden to climb the palm tree. here
we say he cannot climb the tall tree but he can tap the short ones
standing on the ground. it is like dimaragana, who would not lend
his knife for cutting up dogmeat because the dog was taboo to him,
 
 ___________________________
 

but offered to use his teeth."

"i think it is good that our clan holds the ozo title in high esteem,"
said okonkwo. "in those other clans you speak of, ozo is so low
that every beggar takes it."




"i was only speaking in jest," said obierika. "in abame and aninta
the title is worth less than two cowries. every man wears the
thread of title on his ankle, and does not lose it even if he steals."

"they have indeed soiled the name of ozo," said okonkwo as he
rose to go.

"it will not be very long now before my in-laws come," said
obierika.

"i shall return very soon," said okonkwo, looking at the position of
the sun.

there were seven men in obierika's hut when okonkwo returned.
the suitor was a young man of about twenty-five, and wit

h him
were his father and uncle. on obierika's side were his two elder
brothers and maduka, his sixteen-year-old son.

"ask akueke's mother to send us some kola nuts," said obierika to
his son. maduka vanished into the compound like lightning. the
conversation at once centered on him, and everybody agreed that
he was as sharp as a razor.

"i sometimes think he is too sharp," said obierika, somewhat
indulgently. "he hardly ever walks. he is always in a hurry. if you
are sending him on an errand he flies away before he has heard
half of the message."

"you were very much like that yourself," said his eldest brother.
"as our people say, 'when mother-cow is chewing grass its young
ones watch its mouth.' maduka has been watching your mouth."

as he was speaking the boy returned, followed by akueke, his
half-sister, carrying a wooden dish with three kola nuts and
alligator pepper. she

un to pour
out the wine, "before i learned how to tap." he filled the first horn
and gave to his father. then he poured out for the others. okonkwo
brought out lüs big horn from the goatskin bag, blew into it to
remove any dust that might be there, and gave it to ibe to fill.

as the men drank, they talked about everything except the thing
for which they had gathered. it was only after the pot had been
emptied that the suitor's father cleared his voice and announced the
object of their visit.

obierika then presented to him a small bundle of short broomsticks.
ukegbu counted them. "they are thirty?" he asked. obierika
nodded in agreement.

"we are at last getting somewhere," ukegbu said, and then turning
to his brother and his son he said: "let us go out and whisper
together." the three rose and went outside. when they returned
ukegbu handed the bundle of sticks back to obierika. he counted
them,- instead of thirty there were now only fifteen. he passed
them over to his eldest brother, machi,
 
 ___________________________
 
lso counted them and
said:

"we had not thought to go below thirty. but as the dog said, 'if i
fall down for you and you fall down for me, it is play'. marriage
should be a play and not a fight so we are falling down again." he
then added ten sticks to the fifteen and gave the bundle to ukegbu.



in this way akuke's bride-price was finally settled at twenty bags
of cowries. it was already dusk when the two parties came to this
agreement.



"go and tell akueke's mother that we have finished," obierika said
to his son, maduka. almost immediately the women came in with
a big bowl of foo-foo. obierika's second wife followed with a pot
of soup, and maduka brought in a pot of palm-wine.

as the men ate and drank palm-wine they talked about the customs
of their neighbors.

"it was only this morning," said obierika, "that okonkwo and i
were talking about abame and aninta, where titled men climb
trees and pound foo-foo for their wives."

"all their customs are upside-down. they do not decide bride-

 
 ___________________________
 
price as we do, with sticks. they haggle and bargain as if they
were buying a goat or a cow in the market."

"that is very bad," said obierika's eldest brother. "but what is
good in one place is bad in another place. in umunso they do not
bargain at all, not even with broomsticks. the suitor just goes on
bringing bags of cowries until his in-laws tell him to stop. it is a
bad custom because it always leads to a quarrel."

"the world is large," said okonkwo. "i have even heard that in
some tribes a man's children belong to his wife and her family."

"that cannot be," said machi. "you might as well say that the
woman lies on top of the 
 
 ___________________________
 
man when they are making the children."

"it is like the story of white men who, they say, are white like this
piece of chalk," said obierika. he held up a piece of chalk, which
every man kept in his obi and with which his guests drew lines on




the floor before they ate kola nuts. "and these white men, they say,
have no toes."

"and have you never seen them?" asked machi.

"have you?" asked obierika.

"one of them passes here frequently," said machi. "his name is
amadi."

those who knew amadi laughed. he was a leper, and the polite
name for leprosy was "the white skin."

chapter nine

for the first time in three nights, okonkwo slept. he woke up once
in the middle of the night and his mind went back to the past three
days without making him feel uneasy. he began to wonder why he
had felt uneasy at all. it was like a man wondering in broad
daylight why a dream had appeared so terrible to hi

ay to okonkwo. it had
been early in the morning. the moon was shining. she was going
to the stream to fetch water. okonkwo's house was on the way to



the stream. she went in and knocked at his door and he came out.
even in those days he was not a man of many words. he just
carried her into his bed and in the darkness began to feel around
her waist for the loose end of her cloth.





chapter twelve

on the following morning the entire neighborhood wore a festive
air because okonkwo's friend, obierika, was celebrating his
daughter's uri. it was the day on which her suitor (having already
paid the greater part of her bride-price) would bring palm-wine not
only to her parents and immediate relatives but to the wide and
extensive group of kinsmen called umunna. everybody had been
invited—men, women and children. but it was really a woman's
ceremony and the central figures were the bride and her mother.

as soon as day broke, breakfast was hastily eaten and women and
children began to gather a

t obierika's compound to help the bride's
mother in her difficult but happy task of cooking for a whole
village.

okonkwo's family was astir like any other family in the
neighborhood. nwoye's mother and okonkwo's youngest wife
were ready to set out for obierika's compound with all their
children. nwoye's mother carried a basket of coco-yams, a cake of
salt and smoked fish which she would present to obierika's wife.
okonkwo's youngest wife, ojiugo, also had a basket of plantains
and coco-yams and a small pot of palm-oil. their children carried
pots of water.

ekwefi was tired and sleepy from the exhausting experiences of
the previous night. it was not very long since they had returned.
the priestess, with ezinma sleeping on her back, had crawled out
of the shrine on her belly like a snake. she had not as much as





looked at okonkwo and ekwefi or shown any surprise at finding
them at the mouth o
 
 ___________________________
 
f the cave. she looked straight ahead of her and
walked back to the village. okonkwo and his wife followed at a
respectful distance. they thought the priestess might be going to
her house, but she went to okonkwo's compound, passed through
his obi and into ekwefi's hut and walked into her bedroom. she
placed ezinma carefully on the bed and went away without saying
a word to anybody.

ezinma was still sleeping when everyone else was astir, and
ekwefi asked nwoye's mother and ojiugo to explain to obierika's
wife that she would be late. she had got ready her basket of coco-
yams and fish, but she must wait for ezinma to wake.

"you need some sleep yourself," said nwoye's mother. "you look
very tired."

as they spoke ezinma emerged from the hut, rubbing her eyes and
stretching her spare frame. she saw the other children with their
water-pots and remembered that they were going to fetch water for
obierika's wife. she went back to the hut and brought her pot.

"have you slept enough?" asked her moth
 
 ___________________________
 
er.

"yes," she replied. "let us go."

"not before you have had your breakfast," said ekwefi. and she
went into her hut to warm the vegetable soup she had cooked last
night.

"we shall be going," said nwoye's mother. "i will tell obierika's
wife that you are coming later." and so they all went to help
obierika's wife—nwoye's mother with her four children and
ojiugo with her two.



as they trooped through okonkwo's obi he asked: "who will
prepare my afternoon meal?"



"i shall return to do it," said ojiugo.

okonkwo was also feeling tired, and sleepy, for although nobody
else knew it, he had not slept at all last night. he had felt very
anxious but did not show it. when ekwefi had followed the
priestess, he had allowed what he regarded as a reasonable and
manly interval to pass and then gone with
 
 ___________________________
 
 his machete to the shrine,
where he thought they must be. it was only when he had got there
that it had occurred to him that the priestess might have chosen to
go round the villages first. okonkwo had returned home and sat
waiting. when he thought he had waited long enough he again
returned to the shrine. but the hills and the caves were as silent as
death. it was only on his fourth trip that he had found ekwefi, and
by then he had become gravely worried.

obierika's compound was as busy as an anthill. temporary
cooking tripods were erected on every available space by bringing
together three blocks of sun-dried earth and making a fire in their
midst. cooking pots went up and down the tripods and foo-foo was
pounded in a hundred wooden mortars some of the women cooked
the yams and the cassava, and others prepared vegetable soup.
young men pounded the foo-foo or split firewood. the children
made endless trips to the stream.

three young men helped obierika 
 
 ___________________________
 
to slaughter the two goats with
which the soup was made. they were very fat goats, but the fattest
of all was tethered to a peg near the wall of the compound  and was
as big as a small cow. obierika had sent one of his relatives all the
way to umuike to buy that goat it was the one he would present
alive to his in-laws.

"the market of umuike is a wonderful place," said the young man
who had been sent by obierika to buy the giant goat "there are so



many people on it that if you threw up a grain of sand it would not
find a way to fall to earth again."



"it is the result of a great medicine," said obierika. "the people of
umuike wanted their market to grow and swallow up the markets
of their neighbors. so they made a powerful medicine. every
market day, before the first cock-crow, this medicine stands on the
market ground in the shape of an old woman with a fan. with this
magic fan she beckons to th

e market all the neighboring clans. she
beckons in front of her and behind her, to her right and to her left."

"and so everybody comes," said another man, "honest men and
thieves. they can steal your cloth from off your waist in that
market."

"yes" said obierika. "i warned nwankwo to keep a sharp eye and
a sharp ear. there was once a man who went to sell a goat. he led
it on a thick rope which he tied round his wrist. but as he walked
through the market he realized that people were pointing at him as
they do to a madman. he could not understand it until he looked
back and saw that what he led at the end of the tether was not a
goat but a heavy log of wood."

"do you think a thief can do that kind of thing single-handed?"
asked nwankwo.

"no," said obie

ts owner, who at once paid the
heavy fine which the village imposed on anyone whose cow was
let loose on his neighbors' crops. when the women had exacted the
penalty they checked among themselves to see if any woman had
failed to come out when the cry had been raised.

"where is mgbogo?" asked one of them.

"she is ill in bed," said mgbogo's next-door neighbor. "she has
iba."

"the only other person is udenkwo," said another woman, "and
her child is not twenty-eight days yet."

those women whom obierika's wife had not asked to help her
with the cooking returned to their homes, and the rest went back, in
a body, to obierika's compound.

"whose cow was it?" asked the women who had been allowed to
stay behind.

"it was my husband's," said ezelagbo. "one of the young children
had opened the gate of the cow-shed."



early in the afternoon the first two pots of palm-wine arrived from
obierika's in-laws. they were duly presented to the women, who
drank a cup or two each, to help them in their cooki

ng. some of it
also went to the bride and her attendant maidens, who were putting
the last delicate touches of razor to her coiffure and cam wood on
her smooth skin.



when the heat of the sun began to soften, obierika's son, maduka,
took a long broom and swept the ground in front of his father's obi.
and as if they had been waiting for that, obierika's relatives and
friends began to arrive, every man with his goatskin bag hung on
one shoulder and a rolled goatskin mat under his arm. some of
them were accompanied by their sons bearing carved wooden
stools. okonkwo was one of them. they sat in a half-circle and
began to talk of many things. it would not be long before the
suitors came.

okonkwo brought out his snuff-bottle and offered it to ogbuefi
ezenwa, who sat next to him. ezenwa took it, tapped it on his
kneecap, rubbed his left palm on

his body to dry it before tipping a
little snuff into it. his actions were deliberate, and he spoke as he
performed them:

"1 hope our in-laws will bring many pots of wine. although they
come from a village that is known for being closefisted, they ought
to know that akueke is the bride for a king."

"they dare not bring fewer than thirty pots," said okonkwo. "i
shall tell them my mind if they do."

at that moment obierika's son, maduka, led out the giant goat
from the inner compound, for his father's relatives to see. they all
admired it and said that that was the way things should be done.
the goat was then led back to the inner compound.





very soon after, the in-laws began to arrive. young men and boys
in single file, each carrying a pot of wine, came first. obierika's
relatives counted the pots as they came. twenty, twenty-five.
there was a long break, and the hosts looked at each other as if to
say, "1

itor, and the elders of
his family. they sat in a half-moon, thus completing a circle with
their hosts. the pots of wine stood in their midst. then the bride,
her mother and half a dozen other women and girls emerged from
the inner compound, and went round the circle shaking hands with
all. the bride's mother led the way, followed by the bride and the
other women. the married women wore their best cloths and the
girls wore red and black waist-beads and anklets of brass.

when the women retired, obierika presented kola nuts to his in-
laws. his eldest brother broke the first one. "life to all of us," he
said as he broke it. "and let there be friendship between your
family and ours."

the crowd answered-. "ee-e-e!"

"we are giving you our daughter today. she will be a good wife to
you. she will bear you nine sons like the mother of our town."

"ee-e-e!"

the oldest man in the camp of the visitors replied: "it will be good
for you and it will be good for us."

"ee-e-e!"

er happened.

the only course open to okonkwo was to flee from the clan. it was
a crime against the earth goddess to kill a clansman, and a man
who committed it must flee from the land. the crime was of two
kinds, male and female. okonkwo had committed the female,
because it had been inadvertent. he could return to the clan after
seven years.

that night he collected his most valuable belongings into head-
loads. his wives wept bitterly and their children wept with them



without knowing why. obierika and half a dozen other friends
came to help and to console him. they each made nine or ten trips
carrying okonkwo's yams to store in obierika's barn. and before
the cock crowed okonkwo and his family were fleeing to his
motherland. it was a little village called mbanta, just beyond the
borders of mbaino.



as soon as the day broke, a large crowd of men from ezeudu's
quarter stormed okonkwo's compound, dressed in garbs of war.
they set fire to his houses, demolished his red walls, killed his
an

imals and destroyed his barn. it was the justice of the earth
goddess, and they were merely her messengers. they had no hatred
in their hearts against okonkwo. his greatest friend, obierika, was
among them. they were merely cleansing the land which
okonkwo had polluted with the blood of a clansman.

obierika was a man who thought about things. when the will of
the goddess had been done, he sat down in his obi and mourned his
friend's calamity. why should a man suffer so grievously for an
offense he had committed inadvertently? but although he thought
for a long time he found no answer. he was merely led into greater
complexities. he remembered his wife's twin children, whom he
had thrown away. what crime had they committed? the earth had
decreed that they were an offense on the land and must be

chapter fifteen

it was in the second year of okonkwo's exile that his friend,
obierika, came to visit him.

he brought with him two young men, each of them carrying a
heavy bag on his head. okonkwo helped them put down their loads.
it was clear that the bags were full of cowries.

okonkwo was very happy to receive his friend. his wives and
children were very happy too, and so were his cousins and their
wives when he sent for them and told them who his guest was.

"you must take him to salute our father," said one of the cousins.

"yes," replied okonkwo. "we are going directly." b

ut before they
went he whispered something to his first wife. she nodded, and
soon the children were chasing one of their cocks.

uchendu had been told by one of his grandchildren that three
strangers had come to okonkwo's house. he was therefore waiting



to receive them. he held out his hands to them when they came
into his obi, and after they had shaken hands he asked okonkwo
who they were.

"this is obierika, my great friend. i have already spoken to you
about him."



"yes," said the old man, turning to obierika. "my son has told me
about you, and i am happy you have come to see us. i knew your
father, iweka. he was a great man. he had many friends here and
came to see them quite often. those were good days when a man
had friends in distant clans. your generation does not know that.
you stay at home, afraid of your next-door neighbor. even a man's
motherland is strange to him nowadays." he looked

and when they had seen it and thanked him, he broke it and
they ate.

"go into that room," he said to okonkwo, pointing with his finger.
"you will find a pot of wine there."

okonkwo brought the wine and they began to drink. it was a day
old, and very strong.

"yes," said uchendu after a long silence. "people traveled more in
those days. there is not a single clan in these parts that i do not
know very well. aninta, umuazu, ikeocha, elumelu, abame—i
know them all."



"have you heard," asked obierika, "that abame is no more?"



"how is that?" asked uchendu and okonkwo together.

"abame has been wiped out," said obierika. "it is a strange and
terrible story. if i had not seen the few survivors with my own eyes
and heard their story with my own ears, i would not have believed.
was it not on an eke day that they fled into umuofia?" he asked
his two companions, and they nodded their heads.

"during the last planting season a white man had appeared in their
clan."

"an albino," suggested okonkwo.

"he was not an albino. he was quite different." he sipped his wine.
"and he was riding an iron horse. the first people who saw him
ran away, but he stood beckoning to them. in the end the fearless
ones went near and even touched him. the elders consulted their
oracle and it told them that the strange man would break their clan
and spread destruction among them." obierika again drank a little
of his wine. "and so they killed the white man and tied his iron
horse to their sacred tree because it looked as if it would run away
to call the man's friends. i forgot to tell you another thing which
the oracle said. it said that other white men were on their way.
they were locusts, it said, and that first man was their harbinger
sent to explore the terrain. and so they killed him."



"what did the white man say before they killed him?" asked
uchendu.

"he said nothing,

" answered one of obierika's companions.

"he said something, only they did not understand him," said
obierika. "he seemed to speak through his nose."



"one of the men told me," said obierika's other companion, "that
he repeated over and over again a word that resembled mbaino.
perhaps he had been going to mbaino and had lost his way."

"anyway," resumed obierika, "they killed him and tied up his iron
horse. this was before the planting season began. for a long time
nothing happened. the rains had come and yams had been sown.
the iron horse was still tied to the sacred silk-cotton tree. and then
one morning three white men led by a band of ordinary men like us
came to the clan. they saw the iron horse and went away again.
most of the men and women of abame had gone to their farms.
only a few of them saw these white men and their followers. for

instead. 'what did the mother of this chick do?' asked the old kite.
'it cried and raved and cursed me,' said the young kite. 'then we
can eat the chick,' said her mother. 'there is nothing to fear from
someone who shouts.' those men of abame were fools."

"they were fools," said okonkwo after a pause. "they had been
warned that danger was ahead. they should have armed
themselves with their guns and their machetes even when they
went to market."

"they have paid for their foolishness," said obierika, "but i am
greatly afraid. we have heard stories about white men who made
the powerful guns and the strong drinks and took slaves away
across the seas, but no one thought the stories were true."

"there is no story that is not true," said uchendu. "the world has
no end, and what is good among one people is an abomination with
others. we have albinos among us. do you not think that they
came to our clan by mistake, that they have strayed from their way
to a land where everybody is like them?"

konkwo's first wife soon finished her cooking and set before their
guests a big meal of pounded yams and bitter-leaf soup.



okonkwo's son, nwoye, brought in a pot of sweet wine tapped
from the raffia palm.



"you are a big man now," obierika said to nwoye. "your friend
anene asked me to greet you."

"is he well?" asked nwoye.

"we are all well," said obierika.

ezinma brought them a bowl of water with which to wash their
hands. after that they began to eat and to drink the wine.

"when did you set out from home?" asked okonkwo.

"we had meant to set out from my house before cockcrow," said
obierika. "but nweke did not appear until it was quite light. never
make an early morning appointment with a man who has just
married a new wife." they all laughed.

"has nweke married a wife?" asked okonkwo.

"he has married okadigbo's second daughter," said obie

rika.

"that is very good," said okonkwo. "i do not blame you for not
hearing the cock crow."

when they had eaten, obierika pointed at the two heavy bags.

"that is the money from your yams," he said. "i sold the big ones
as soon as you left. later on i sold some of the seed-yams and gave
out others to sharecroppers. i shall do that every year until you
return. but 1 thought you would need the money now and so i
brought it. who knows what may happen tomorrow? perhaps
green men will come to our clan and shoot us."



"god will not permit it," said okonkwo. "1 do not know how to
thank you."



"i can tell you," said

obierika. "kill one of your sons for



me.

"that will not be enough," said okonkwo.

"then kill yourself," said obierika.

"forgive me," said okonkwo, smiling. "i shall not talk about
thanking you any more."

chapter sixteen

when nearly two years later obierika paid another visit to his
friend in exile the circumstances were less happy. the missionaries
had come to umuofia. they had built their church there, won a
handful of converts and were already sending evangelists to the
surrounding towns and villages. that was a source of great sorrow
to the leaders of the clan, but many of them believed that the
strange faith and the white man's god would not last. none of his
converts was a man whose word was heeded in ihe assembly of the
people. none of them
 
 ___________________________
 
 was a man of title. they were mostly the
kind of people that were called efulefu, worthless, empty men. the
imagery of an efulefu in the language of the clan was a man who
sold his machete and wore the sheath to battle. chielo, the priestess
of agbala, called the converts the excrement of the clan, and the
new faith was a mad dog that had come to eat it up.

what moved obierika to visit okonkwo was the sudden
appearance of the latter's son, nwoye, among the missionaries in
umuofia.



"what are you doing here?" obierika had asked when  after many
difficulties the missionaries had allowed him to speak to the boy.



"1 am one of them," replied nwoye.

"how is your father?" obierika asked, not knowing what else to
say.

"1 don't know. he is not my father," said nwoye, unhappily.

and so obierika went to mbanta to see his friend. and he found
that okonkwo did not wish t

hese seven years he would



have climbed to the utmost heights. and so he regretted every day
of his exile. his mother's kinsmen had been very kind to him, and
he was grateful. but that did not alter the facts. he had called the
first child born to him in exile nneka—"mother is supreme"—out
of politeness to his mother's kinsmen. but two years later when a
son was born he called him nwofia—"begotten in the
wilderness."



as soon as he entered his last year in exile okonkwo sent money
to obierika to build him two huts in his old compound where he
and his family would live until he built more huts and the outside
wall of his compound. he could not ask another man to build his
own obi for him, nor the walls of his compound. those things a
man built for himself or inherited from his father.

as the last heavy rains of the year began to fall, obierika sent word
that the two huts had been built and okonkwo began to prepare for
his return, after the rains. he would have liked to return earlie

ere men of title who should
be above such mean occupation. they were grieved by the
indignity and mourned for their neglected farms. as they cut grass
in the morning the younger men sang in time with the strokes of
their machetes:

"kotma of the ashy buttocks,

he is fit to be a slave. the white man has no sense,

he is fit to be a slave."

the court messengers did not like to be called ashy-buttocks, and
they beat the men. but the song spread in umuofia.

okonkwo's head was bowed in sadness as obierika told him these
things.

"perhaps i have been away too long," okonkwo said, almost to
himself. "but i cannot understand these things you tell me. what is
it that has happened to our people? why have they lost the power
to fight?"




"have you not heard how the white man wiped out abame?" asked
obierika.

"i have heard," said okonkwo. "but i have also heard that abame
people were weak and foolish. why did they not fight back? had
they no guns and machetes? we would be cowards lo compare

es with the men of abame. their fathers had never dared to
stand before our ancestors. we must fight these men and drive
them from the land."

"it is already too late," said obierika sadly. "our own men and our
sons have joined the ranks of the stranger. they have joined his
religion and they help to uphold his government. if we should try
to drive out the white men in umuofia we should find it easy.
there are only two of them. but what of our own people who are
following their way and have been given power? they would go to
umuru and bring the soldiers, and we would be like abame." he
paused for a long time and then said: "i told you on my last visit to

e end of the village to the other and walked
all its breadth. he did not leave out any of the main footpaths.

okonkwo's compound was like a deserted homestead. it was as if
cold water had been poured on it. his family was all there, but
everyone spoke in whispers. his daughter ezinma had broken her
twenty-eight day visit to the family of her future husband, and
returned home when she heard that her father had been imprisoned,
and was going to be hanged. as soon as she got home she went to




obierika to ask what the men of umuofia were going to do about it.
but obierika had not been home since morning. his wives thought
he had gone to a secret meeting. ezinma was satisfied that
something was being done.

on the morning after the village crier's appeal the men of umuofia
met in the marketplace and decided to collect without delay two
hundred and fifty bags of cowries to appease the white man. they
did not know that fifty bags would go to the court messengers, who
had increased the fine for t

groups of men joined them until they became a sizable company.
they walked silently. as each of the six men got to his compound,
he turned in, taking some of the crowd with him. the village was
astir in a silent, suppressed way.



ezinma had prepared some food for her father as soon as news
spread that the six men would be released. she took it to him in his
obi. he ate absent-mindedly. he had no appetite, he only ate to
please her. his male relations and friends had gathered in his obi,
and obierika was urging him to eat. nobody else spoke, but they
noticed the long stripes on okonkwo's back where the warder's
whip had cut into his flesh.



the village crier was abroad again in the night. he beat his iron
gong and announced that another meeting would be held in the
morning. everyone knew that umuofia was at last going to speak
its mind about the things that were happening.

okonkwo slept very little that night. the bitterness in his heart was
now mixed with a kind of childlike excitement,

m that our fathers never fought a 'war of blame.' if they listen to
him i shall leave them and plan my own revenge."

the crier's voice had once more become faint, and the distance had
taken the harsh edge off his iron gong. okonkwo turned from one
side to the other and derived a kind of pleasure from the pain his
back gave him. "let egonwanne talk about a 'war of blame'
tomorrow and i shall show him my back and head." he ground his
teeth.

the marketplace began to fill as soon as the sun rose. obierika was
waiting in his obi when okonkwo came along and called him. he
hung his goatskin bag and his sheathed machete on his shoulder
and went out to join him. obierika's hut was close to the road and
he saw every man who passed to the marketplace. he had
exchanged greetings with many who had already passed that
morning.

when okonkwo and obierika got to the meeting place there were
already so many people that if one threw up a grain of sand it
would not find its way to the earth again. and many mor

e people
were coming from every quarter of the nine villages. it warmed
okonkwo's heart to see such strength of numbers. but he was



looking for one man in particular, the man whose tongue he
dreaded and despised so much.



"can you see him?" he asked obierika.

"who?"

"egonwanne," he said, his eyes roving from one corner of the huge
marketplace to the other. most of the men sat on wooden stools
they had brought with them.

"no," said obierika, casting his eyes over the crowd. "yes, there
he is, under the silk-cotton tree. are you afraid he would convince
us not to fight?"

"afraid? i do not care what he does to you. i despise him and those
who listen to him. i shall fight alone if i choose."

they spoke at the top of their voices because everybody was
talking, and it was like the sound of a great market.

"i shall wait till he has spoken," okonkwo thought. "then i shall
speak."

"but how do you know he will speak against war?" obier

ika asked
after a while.

"because i know he is a coward," said okonkwo. obierika did not
hear the rest of what he said because at that moment somebody
touched his shoulder from behind and he turned round to shake
hands and exchange greetings with five or six friends. okonkwo
did not turn round even though he knew the voices. he was in no
mood to exchange greetings. but one of the men touched him and
asked about the people of his compound.

"they are well," he replied without interest.



the first man to speak to umuofia that morning was okika, one of
the six who had been

he discerned fright in that tumult. he heard voices
asking: "why did he do it?"

he wiped his machete on the sand and went away.

chapter twenty-five

when the district commissioner arrived at okonkwo's compound
at the head of an armed band of soldiers and court messengers he
found a small crowd of men sitting wearily in the obi. he
commanded them to come outside, and they obeyed without a
murmur.

"which among you is called okonkwo?" he asked through his
interpreter.

"he is not here," replied obierika.

"where is he?"

"he is not here!"



the commissioner became angry and red in the face. he warned
the men that unless they produced okonkwo forthwith he would
lock them all up. the men murmured among themselves, and
obierika spoke again.



"we can take you where he is, and perhaps your men will help us."

the commissioner did not understand what obierika meant when
he said, "perhaps your men will help us." one of the most
infuriating habits of these people was their love of superfluous
word

s, he thought.

obierika with five or six others led the way. the commissioner
and his men followed their firearms held at the ready. he had
warned obierika that if he and his men played any monkey tricks
they would be shot. and so they went.

there was a small bush behind okonkwo's compound. the only
opening into this bush from the compound was a little round hole
in the red-earth wall through which fowls went in and out in their
endless search for food. the hole would not let a man through. it
was to this bush that obierika led the commissioner and his men.
they skirted round the compound, keeping close to the wall. the
only sound they made was w

ith their feet as they crushed dry
leaves.

then they came to the tree from which okonkwo's body was
dangling, and they stopped dead.

"perhaps your men can help us bring him down and bury him,"
said obierika. "we have sent for strangers from another village to
do it for us, but they may be a long time coming."

the district commissioner changed instantaneously. the resolute
administrator in him gave way to the student of primitive customs.



"why can't you take him down yourselves?" he asked.



"it is against our custom," said one of the men. "it is an
abomination for a man to take his own life. it is an offense against
the earth, and a man who commits it will not be buried by his
clansmen. his 
 
 ___________________________
 
body is evil, and only strangers may touch it. that is
why we ask your people to bring him down, because you are
strangers."

"will you bury him like any other man?" asked the commissioner.

"we cannot bury him. only strangers can. we shall pay your men
to do it. when he has been buried we will then do our duty by him.
we shall make sacrifices to cleanse the desecrated land."

obierika, who had been gazing steadily at his friend's dangling
body, turned suddenly to the district commissioner and said
ferociously: "that man was one of the greatest men in umuofia.
you drove him to kill himself and now he will be buried like a
dog…" he could not say any more. his voice trembled and choked
his words.

"shut up!" shouted one of the messengers, quite unnecessarily.

"take down the body," the commissioner ordered his chief
messenger, "and bring it and all these people to the court."
