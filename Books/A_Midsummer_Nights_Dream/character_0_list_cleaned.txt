[CHARACTER] - 
                also
known as robin goodfellow, [CHARACTER] is oberon's jester, a mischievous
fairy who delights in playing pranks on mortals. though a
midsummer night's dream divides its action between several
groups of characters, [CHARACTER] is the closest thing the play has to
a protagonist. his enchanting, mischievous spirit pervades the atmosphere,
and his antics are responsible for many of the complications that
propel the other main plots: he mistakes the young athenians,
applying the love potion to lysander instead of demetrius, thereby causing
chaos within the group of young lovers; he also transforms bottom's
head into that of an ass.
