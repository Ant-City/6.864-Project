again. â€œa womanâ€™s. she has been dead these twenty years. she sent me the
pages in question before she died.â€ they were all listening now, and
of course there was somebody to be arch, or at any rate to draw the
inference. but if he put the inference by without a smile it was also
without irritation. â€œshe was a most charming person, but she was ten
years older than i. she was my sisterâ€™s governess,â€ he quietly said.
â€œshe was the most agreeable woman iâ€™ve ever known in her position;
she would have been worthy of any whatever. it was long ago, and this
episode was long before. i was at trinity, and i found her at home on
my coming down the second summer. i was much there that year--it was a
beautiful one; and we had, in her off-hours, some strolls and talks in
the garden--talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice. oh
yes; donâ€™t grin: i liked her extremely and am glad

which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little
establishment--but below stairs only--an excellent woman, mrs. grose,
whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid
to his mother. she was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time
as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without children of her
own, she was, by good luck, extremely fond. there were plenty of people
to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess
would be in supreme authority. she would also have, in holidays, to look
after the small boy, who had been for a term at school--young as he was
to be sent, but what else could be done?--and who, as the holidays were
about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. there had
been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the
misfortune to lose. she had done for them quite beautifully--she was a
most respectable person--till her death, the great awkwardness of which

mrs. grose, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as
she could for flora; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a
dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all likewise
thoroughly respectable.

so far had douglas presented his picture when someone put a question.
â€œand what did the former governess die of?--of so much respectability?â€

our friendâ€™s answer was prompt. â€œthat will come out. i donâ€™t
anticipate.â€

â€œexcuse me--i thought that was just what you are doing.â€

â€œin her successorâ€™s place,â€ i suggested, â€œi should have wished to learn
if the office brought with it--â€

â€œnecessary danger to life?â€ douglas completed my thought. â€œshe did wish
to learn, and she did learn. you shall hear tomorrow what she learned.
meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as

she stared, taking my meaning in; but it produced in her an odd laugh.
â€œare you afraid heâ€™ll corrupt you?â€ she put the question with such a
fine bold humor that, with a laugh, a little silly doubtless, to match
her own, i gave way for the time to the apprehension of ridicule.

but the next day, as the hour for my drive approached, i cropped up in
another place. â€œwhat was the lady who was here before?â€

â€œthe last governess? she was also young and pretty--almost as young and
almost as pretty, miss, even as you.â€

â€œah, then, i hope her youth and her beauty helped her!â€ i recollect
throwing off. â€œhe seems to like us young and pretty!â€

â€œoh, he did,â€ mrs. grose assented: â€œit was the way he liked everyone!â€
 she had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up. â€œi mean
thatâ€™s his way--the masterâ€™s.â€

i was struck. â€œbut of whom did you speak first?â€

prose of my office. there was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no
long grind; so how could work not be charming that presented itself as
daily beauty? it was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of
the schoolroom. i donâ€™t mean by this, of course, that we studied
only fiction and verse; i mean i can express no otherwise the sort
of interest my companions inspired. how can i describe that except by
saying that instead of growing used to them--and itâ€™s a marvel for a
governess: i call the sisterhood to witness!--i made constant fresh
discoveries. there was one direction, assuredly, in which these
discoveries stopped: deep obscurity continued to cover the region of the
boyâ€™s conduct at school. it had been promptly given me, i have noted,
to face that mystery without a pang. perhaps even it would be nearer the
truth to say that--without a word--he himself had cleared it up. he had
made the whole charge absurd. my conclusion bloomed there with the
real rose flush of h

either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of tears
and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of mutual
challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating
together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have
everything out. the result of our having everything out was simply to
reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements. she herself had
seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in the house but
the governess was in the governessâ€™s plight; yet she accepted without
directly impugning my sanity the truth as i gave it to her, and ended by
showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness, an expression
of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of which the very
breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human charities.

what was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we
thought we might bear things together; and i was not even sure that,

decision: â€œit must have been also what she wished!â€

mrs. groseâ€™s face signified that it had been indeed, but she said at the
same time: â€œpoor woman--she paid for it!â€

â€œthen you do know what she died of?â€ i asked.

â€œno--i know nothing. i wanted not to know; i was glad enough i didnâ€™t;
and i thanked heaven she was well out of this!â€

â€œyet you had, then, your idea--â€

â€œof her real reason for leaving? oh, yes--as to that. she couldnâ€™t have
stayed. fancy it here--for a governess! and afterward i imagined--and i
still imagine. and what i imagine is dreadful.â€

â€œnot so dreadful as what _i_ do,â€ i replied; on which i must have shown
her--as i was indeed but too conscious--a front of miserable defeat. it
brought out again all her compassion for me, and at the renewed touch of
her kindness my power to resist broke down. i burst, as i had, the other
time, made her burst, into tears; she took me to her motherly breast,
and my lamentation overflowed. â€œi donâ€™t do it!â

ns, but as shakespeareans,
astronomers, and navigators. this was so singularly the case that it had
presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day,
i am at a loss for a different explanation: i allude to my unnatural
composure on the subject of another school for miles. what i remember
is that i was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that
contentment must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking
show of cleverness. he was too clever for a bad governess, for a
parsonâ€™s daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not the brightest
thread in the pensive embroidery i just spoke of was the impression i
might have got, if i had dared to work it out, that he was under some
influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous
incitement.

if it was easy to reflect, however, that such a boy could postpone
school, it was at least as marked that for such a boy to have been
â€œkicked outâ€ by a schoolmaster was a mystification without end.

standing there before me while i kept my seat, she visibly turned things
over. â€œtheir uncle must do the preventing. he must take them away.â€

â€œand whoâ€™s to make him?â€

she had been scanning the distance, but she now dropped on me a foolish
face. â€œyou, miss.â€

â€œby writing to him that his house is poisoned and his little nephew and
niece mad?â€

â€œbut if they are, miss?â€

â€œand if i am myself, you mean? thatâ€™s charming news to be sent him by a
governess whose prime undertaking was to give him no worry.â€

mrs. grose considered, following the children again. â€œyes, he do hate
worry. that was the great reason--â€

â€œwhy those fiends took him in so long? no doubt, though his indifference
must have been awful. as iâ€™m not a fiend, at any rate, i shouldnâ€™t take
him in.â€

my companion, after an instant and for all answer, sat down again and
grasped my arm. â€œmake him at any rate come to you.â€

because i now see how, with the word he spoke, the curtain rose on the
last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe was precipitated.

please, am i going back to school?â€

transcribed here the speech sounds harmless enough, particularly
as uttered in the sweet, high, casual pipe with which, at all
interlocutors, but above all at his eternal governess, he threw off
intonations as if he were tossing roses. there was something in
them that always made one â€œcatch,â€ and i caught, at any rate, now so
effectually that i stopped as short as if one of the trees of the
park had fallen across the road. there was something new, on the spot,
between us, and he was perfectly aware that i recognized it, though,
to enable me to do so, he had no need to look a whit less candid and
charming than usual. i could feel in him how he already, from my at

before a new day, in my room, had fully broken, my eyes opened to mrs.
grose, who had come to my bedside with worse news. flora was so markedly
feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a night of
extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had for their
subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present, governess.
it was not against the possible re-entrance of miss jessel on the scene
that she protested--it was conspicuously and passionately against mine.
i was promptly on my feet of course, and with an immense deal to ask;
the more that my friend had discernibly now girded her loins to meet me
once more. this i felt as soon as i had put to her the question of
her sense of the childâ€™s sincerity as against my own. â€œshe persists in
denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?â€
