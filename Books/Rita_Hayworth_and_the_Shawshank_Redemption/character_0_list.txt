                The narrator of the story. A convicted murderer serving a life sentence, Red writes the story to try to make sense of his friendship with Andy, his life in prison, and his hopes for the future. Red is a key figure inside prison, a lifeline to the outside world who can smuggle almost anything into the prison--for a price. Once paroled, he struggles with his newfound freedom, dissatisfied with his job and still without hope for a better future.
