[prologue]

                enter the ghost of andrea, and with him revenge.

  ghost.  when this eternal substance of my soul
    did live imprison'd in my wanto

me remedy.
    some cause there is that lets you not be lov'd:
    first that must needs be known, and then remov'd.
    what if my sister love some other knight?

  bal.  my summer's day will turn to winter's night.

  lor.  i have already found a stratagem
    to sound the bottom of this doubtful theme.
    my lord, for once you shall be rul'd by me;
    hinder me not what ere you hear or see:
    by force or fair means will i cast about
    to find the truth of all this question out.
    ho, pedringano!

  ped.          signior.

  lor.                  vien qui presto!

                enter pedringano.

  ped.  hath your lordship any service to command me?

  lor.  aye, pedringano, service of import.
    and, not to spend the time in trifling words,
    thus stands the case:  it is not long, thou know'st,
    since i did shield thee from my father's wrath
    for thy convenience in andrea's love,
    for which thou wert adjudg'd to punishment;
    i stood betwixt thee and thy punishment,

  and since thou knowest how i have favour'd thee.
    now to these favours will i add reward,
    not with fair words, but store of golden coin
    and lands and living join'd with dignities,
    if thou but satisfy my just demand;
    tell truth and have me for thy lasting friend.

  ped.  whate'er it be your lordship shall demand,
    my bounden duty bids me tell the truth,
    if case it lie in me to tell the truth.

  lor.  then, pedringano, this is my demand;
    whom loves my sister bel-imperia?
    for she reposeth all her trust in thee.
    speak, man, and gain both friendship and reward:
    i mean, whom loves she in andrea's place?

  ped.  alas, my lord, since don andrea's death
    i have no credit with her as before,
    and therefore know not if she love or no.

  lor.  nay, if thou dally, then i am thy foe,
    and fear shall force what friendship cannot win.
    thy death shall bury what thy life conceals.
    thou die

our's liberality
    deserves my duteous service ev'n till death.

  lor.  let this be all that thou shall do for me:
    be watchful when and where these lovers meet,
    and give me notice in some secret sort.

  ped.  i will, my lord.

  lor.  then thou shalt find that i am liberal.
    thou know'st that i can more advance thy state
    than she:  be therefore wise and fail me not.
    go and attend her as thy custom is,
    least absence make her think thou dost amiss.

                exit pedringano.

    why, so, tam armis quam ingenio:
    where words prevail not, violence prevails.
    but gold doth more than either of them both.
    how likes prince balthazar this stratagem?

  bal.  both well and ill; it makes me glad and sad:
    glad, that i know the hind'rer of my love;
    sad, that i fear she hates me whom i love;
    glad, that i know on whom to be reveng'd;
    sad, that she'll fly me if i take revenge.
    yet must i take revenge or die myself;
    for love resisted grows impa

[act ii.  scene 2.]

[the duke's castle]

                enter horatio and bel-imperia.

  hor.  now, madame, since by favour of your love
    our hidden smoke is turn'd to open flame,
    and that with looks and words we feed our thought,--
    two chief contents where more cannot be had,--
    thus in the midst of love's fair blandishments
    why show you sign of inward languishments?

                pedringano showeth all to the prince and
                lorenzo, placing them in secret.

  bel.  my heart, sweet friend, is like a ship at sea:
    she wisheth port, where, riding all at ease,
    she may repair what stormy times have worn,
    and, leaning on the shore, may sing with joy
    that pleasure follows pain, and bliss annoy.
    possession of thy love is th' only port
    wherein my heart, with fears and hopes long toss'd,
    each hour doth wish and long to make resort,
    there to repair

e ruled by their friends.
    the prince is amiable, and loves her well;
    if she neglect him and forgo his love,
    she both will wrong her own estate and ours.
    therefore, whiles i do entertain the prince
    with greatest pleasure that our court affords,
    endeavor you to win your daughter's thought.
    if she give back, all this will come to naught.

                exeunt.




[act ii.  scene 4.]

                [horatio's garden.]

                enter horatio, bel-imperia, and pedringano.

  hor.  now that the night begins with sable wings
    to over-cloud the brightness of the sun,
    and that in darkness pleasures may be done,
    come, bel-imperia, let us to the bower,
    and there is safety pass a pleasant hour.

  bel.  i follow thee, my love, and will not back,
    although my fainting heart controls my soul.

  hor.  why, make you doubt of pedringano's faith?

  bel.  no; he is as trusty as my second self.
    go, pedringano, watch without the gate,
    and let us kno

  ped.  [aside]  instead of watching, i'll deserve more gold
    by fetching don lorenzo to this match.

  hor.  what means my love?

  bel.                          i know not what, myself;
    and yet my heart foretells me some mischance.

  hor.  sweet, say not so; fair fortune is our friend,
    and heav'ns have shut up day to pleasure us.
    the stars, thou see'st, hold back their twinkling shine
    and luna hides herself to pleasure us.

  bel. thou hast prevail'd!  i'll conquer my misdoubt,
    and in thy love and counsel drown my fear.
    i fear no more; love now is all my thoughts!

 at thee.

  hor. thus i return the dart thou throwest at me!

  bel.  nay then, to gain the glory of the field,
    my twining arms shall yoke and make thee yield.

  hor.  nay then, my arms are large and strong withal:
    thus elms by vines are compass'd till they fall.

  bel.  o, let me go, for in my troubled eyes
    now may'st thou read that life in passion dies!

  hor.  o, stay a-while, and i will die with thee;
    so shalt thou yield, and yet have conquer'd me.

  bel.  who's there?  pedringano?  we are betray'd!

                enter lorenzo, balthazar, serberine,
                pedringano, disguised.

  lor.  my lord, away with her!  take her aside!
    o sir, forbear, your valour is already tried.
    quickly dispatch, my masters.

                they hang him in the arbor.

  hor.                          what, will you murder me?

  lor.  aye; thus!  and thus!  these are the fruits of love!

                they stab him.

  bel.  o, save his life, and let me die for him!

    and he, for thy dishonour done, should draw
    thy life in question and thy name in hate.
    dear was the life of my beloved son,
    and of his death behooves me be aveng'd:
    then hazard not thine own, hieronimo,
    but live t'effect thy resolution!
    i therefore will by circumstances try
    what i can gather to confirm this writ,
    and, harken near the duke of castile's house,
    close if i can with bel-imperia,
    to listen more, but nothing to bewray.

                enter pedringano.

    now, pedringano!

  ped.                  now, hieronimo!

  hiero.  where's thy lady?

  ped.                  i know not; here's my lord.

                enter lorenzo.

  lor.  how now, who's this?  hieronimo?

  hiero.                my lord.

  ped.  he asketh for my lady bel-imperia.

  lor.  what to do, hieronimo?  use me.

  hiero.  oh, no, my lord, i dare not, it must not be;
    i humbly thank your lordship.

  lor.                          why then, farewell!

  lor.  come hither, pedringano; see'st thou this?

  ped.  my lord, i see it, and suspect it too.

  lor.  this is that damned villain serberine,
    that hath, i fear, reveal'd horatio's death.

  ped.  my lord, he could not; 'twas so lately done,
    and since he hath not left my company.

  lor.  admit he have not; his conditions such
    as fear or flattering words may make him false.
    i know his humour, and therewith repent
    that e'er i us'd him in this enterprise.

  ped.  but how shall serberine be there, my lord?

  lor.  let me alone, i'll send him to meet
    the prince and me where thou must do this deed.

  ped.  it shall be done, my lord; it shall be done;
    and i'll go arm myself to meet him there.

  lor.  when things shall alter, as i hope they will,
    then shalt thou mount for this, thou knowest my mind.

  lor.                  go, sirrah,

    the prince and me at s. luigi's park,
    behind the house, this evening, boy.

    bid him not fail.

    this night shall murder hapless serberine.
    thus must we work that will avoid distrust,
    thus must we practice to prevent mishap,
    and thus one ill another must expulse.
    this sly enquiry of hieronimo
    for bel-imperia breeds suspicion;
    and this suspicion bodes a further ill.
    as for myself, i know my secret fault,
    and so do they, but i have dealt for them.
    they that for coin their souls endangered
    to save my life, for coin shall venture theirs;

                enter pedringano with a pistol.

  ped.  now, pedringano, bid thy pistol hold;
    and hold on, fortune!  once more favour me!
    give but success to mine attempting spirit,
    and let me shift for taking of mine aim.
    here is the gold!  this is the gold propos'd!
    it is no dream that i adventure for,
    but pedringano is posses'd thereof.
    and he that would not strain his conscience
    for him that thus his liberal purse hath stretch'd,
    unworthy such a favour, may he fail,

    methinks this corner is to close with one.

empty box!  were it not sin against secrecy, i would say it were a
piece of gentlemanlike knavery.  i must go to pedringano and tell him
his pardon is in this box!  nay, i would have sworn it, had i not
seen the contrary.  i cannot choose but smile to think how the villain
will flout the gallows, scorn the audience, and descant on the hangman,
and all presuming of his pardon from hence.  will't not be an odd jest,
for me to stand and grace every jest he makes, pointing my finger at
