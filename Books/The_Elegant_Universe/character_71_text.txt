alamity that the tear would otherwise create.

figure  11.6  the  world-sheet  swept  out  by  a  string  provides  a  shield  that  cancels  the  potentially
cataclysmic effects associated with a tear in the fabric of space.

in january 1993, witten and the three of us released our papers simultaneously to the electronic
internet archive through which physics papers are immediately made available worldwide. the two
papers described, from our widely different perspectives, the first examples of topology-changing
transitions—the  technical  name  for  the  space-tearing  processes  we  had  found.  the  long-standing
question about whether the fabric of space can tear had been settled quantitatively by string theory.

consequences

we have made much of the realization that spatial tears can occur without physical calamity. but what
does happen when the spatial fabric rips? what are the observable consequences? we have seen that
many  properties  of  the  world  around  us  depend  upon  the

l dimensions might themselves actually be curled up into the form of a
giant shape that curves back on itself, way on the other side of the universe, and that therefore even
the  distinction  between  which  dimensions  are  curled  up  and  which  are  unfurled  is  somewhat
artificial. although our and witten's analyses did rely on special mathematical features of calabi-yau
shapes, the result—that the fabric of space can tear—is certainly of wider applicability.

second,  could  such  a  topology-changing  tear  happen  today  or  tomorrow?  could  it  have
happened  in  the  past? yes.  experimental  measurements  of  elementary  particle  masses  show  their
values to be quite stable over time. but if we head back to the earliest epochs following the big bang,
even non-string-based theories invoke important periods during which elementary particle masses do
change over time. these periods, from a string-theoretic perspective, could certainly have involved

iscussed in this chapter. closer to the present, the observed stability of
elementary particle masses implies that if the universe is currently undergoing a topology-changing
spatial tear, it must be doing it exceedingly slowly—so slowly that its effect on elementary particle
masses is smaller than our present experimental sensitivity. remarkably, so long as this condition is
met,  the  universe  could  currently  be  in  the  midst  of  a  spatial  rupture.  if  it  were  occurring  slowly
enough, we would not even know it was happening. this is one of those rare instances in physics in
which the lack of a striking observable phenomenon is cause for grea

symmetry  is  a  second  example.  here  two  different  calabi-yau  shapes  of  the  extra  six  spatial
dimensions—universes that at first sight would appear to be completely distinct—yield exactly the
same physical properties. they give dual descriptions of a single universe. of crucial importance,
unlike the case of english versus chinese, there are important physical insights that follow from using
these  dual  descriptions,  such  as  a  minimum  size  for  circular  dimensions  and  topology-changing
processes in string theory.

in his lecture at strings '95, witten gave evidence for a new, profound kind of duality. as briefly
outlined at the beginning of this chapter, he suggested that the five string theories, although apparently
different  in  their  basic  construction,  are  all  just  different  ways  of  describing  the  same  underlying
physics. rather than having five different string theories, then, we would simply have five different
windows onto this single underlying t

inched one-dimensional sphere—the collapsed
circle—with  a  zero-dimensional  sphere—two  points—plugging  the  holes  in  the  upper  and  lower
portions of the shape arising from the tear. as shown in figure 13.3, the resulting shape looks like a
warped banana, which through gentle deformation (non–space tearing) can be reshaped smoothly into
the surface of a beach ball. we see, therefore, that when a one-dimensional sphere collapses and is
replaced by a zero-dimensional sphere, the topology of the original doughnut, that is, its fundamental
shape,  is  drastically  altered.  in  the  context  of  the  curled-up  spatial  dimensions,  the  space-tearing
progression  of  figure  13.3  would  result  in  the  universe  depicted  in  figure  8.8  evolving  into  that
depicted in figure 8.7.

transformation to a completely different shape—a beach ball.

although this is a lower-dimensional analogy, it captures the essential features of what morrison
and  i  foresaw  for  the  second  half  of  strominger's  story. after  the  collapse  of  a  three-dimensional
sphere inside a calabi-yau space, it seemed to us that space could tear and subsequently repair itself
by growing a two-dimensional sphere, leading to far more drastic changes in topology than witten
and we had found in our earlier work (discussed in chapter 11). in this way, one calabi-yau shape
could,  in  essence,  transform  itself  into  a  completely  different  calabi-yau  shape—much  like  the
doughnut  transforming  into  the  beach  ball  in  figure  13.3—while  string  physics  remained  perfectly
well behaved. although a picture was starting to emerge, we knew that there were significant aspects
that we would need to work out before we could establish that our se

went home that evening with the tentative elation that we were sitting on a major new insight.

a flurry of e-mail

the next morning i received an e-mail from strominger asking me for any comments or reactions to
his  paper.  he  mentioned  that  "it  should  tie  in  somehow  with  your  work  with  aspinwall  and
morrison,"  because,  as  it  turned  out,  he  too  had  been  exploring  a  possible  connection  to  the
phenomenon  of  topology  change.  i  immediately  sent  him  an  e-mail  describing  the  rough  outline
morrison  and  i  had  come  up  with.  when  he  responded,  it  was  clear  that  his  level  of  excitement
matched what morrison and i had been riding since the preceding day.

during the next few days a continuous stream of e-mail messages circulated between the three of
us as we sought feverishly to put quantitative rigor behind our idea of drastic space-tearing topology
change. slowly but surely, all the det

ted. recall that we expressed through figure 12.11 that the five string
theories  are  dual  to  one  another  and  thereby  are  unified  under  the  rubric  of  a  single  overarching
theory. but does the ability to move continuously from one description to another—to set sail from
any  point  on  the  map  of  figure  12.11  and  reach  any  other—persist  even  after  we  allow  the  extra
dimensions to curl up into some calabi-yau shape or another? prior to the discovery of the drastic
topology-changing  results,  the  anticipated  answer  was  no,  since  there  was  no  known  way  to
continuously deform one calabi-yau shape into any other. but now we see that the answer is yes:
through these physically sensible space-tearing conifold transitions, we can continuously change any
given  calabi-yau  space  into  any  other.  by  varying  coupling  constants  and  curled-up  calabi-yau
geometry,  we  see  that  all  string  constructions  are,  once  again,  different  phases  of  a  si

t they curve back
on  themselves  only  beyond  the  range  of  our  current  observational  capacity,  a  circular  shape  is
consistent with the universe we observe. but for dimensions that stay small, a more realistic scenario
is one in which they are curled up into a more intricate calabi-yau space. of course, the key question
is,  which  calabi-yau  space?  how  is  this  particular  space  determined?  no  one  has  been  able  to
answer  this  question.  but  by  combining  the  drastic  topology-changing  results  described  in  the
preceding  chapter  with  these  cosmological  insights,  we  can  suggest  a  framework  for  doing  so.
through the space-tearing conifold transitions, we now know that any calabi-yau shape can evolve
into any other. so, we can imagine that in the tumultuous, hot moments after the bang, the curled-up
calabi-yau component of space stays small, but goes through a frenetic dance in which its fabric rips
apart  and  reconnects  over  and  over  again,  rapidl

1. the mathematically inclined reader will recognize that we are asking whether the topology of
space  is  dynamical—that  is,  whether  it  can  change.  we  note  that  although  we  will  often  use  the
language  of  dynamical  topology  change,  in  practice  we  are  usually  considering  a  one-parameter
family  of spacetimes whose topology changes as a function of the parameter. technically speaking,
this parameter is not time, but in certain limits can essentially be identified with time.
