e had to make sure it would be. the red shutters
had haunted both helene sabat and her grandmother for
sixteen years. helene was born behind those shutters,
daughter of a creole whore who worked there. the
grandmother took helene away from the soft lights and
flowered carpets of the sundown house and raised her
under the dolesome eyes of a multicolored virgin mary,
counseling her to be constantly on guard for any sign of her
mother's wild blood. so when wiley wright came to visit his
great aunt cecile in new orleans, his enchantment with the
pretty helene became a marriage proposal--under the
pressure of both women. he was a seaman (or rather a
lakeman, for he was a ship's cook on one of the great

orleans. cecile sabat's house leaned between two others
just like it on elysian fields. a frenchified shotgun house, it
sported a magnificent garden in the back and a tiny
wrought-iron fence in the front. on the door hung a black
crepe wreath with purple ribbon. they were too late. helene
reached up to touch the ribbon, hesitated, and knocked. a
man in a collarless shirt opened the door. helene identified
herself and he said he was henri martin and that he was
there for the settin'-up. they stepped into the ho

virgin mary clasped her hands in front of her neck three
times in the front room and once in the bedroom where
cecile's body lay. the old woman had died without seeing
or blessing her granddaughter. no one other than mr.
martin seemed to be in the house, but a sweet odor as of
gardenias told them that someone else had been. blotting
her lashes with a white handkerchief, helene walked
through the kitchen to the back bedroom where she had
slept for sixteen years. nel trotted along behind, enchanted
with the smell, the candles and the strangeness. when
helene bent to loosen the ribbons of nel's hat, a woman in
