, a
male named pierre whom jonas didn't like much. pierre was very
serious, not much fun, and a worrier and tattletale, too. "have you
checked the rules, jonas?" pierre was always whispering solemnly.
"i'm not sure that's within the rules." usually it was some foolish



thing that no one cared about-opening his tunic if it was a day with
a breeze; taking a brief try on a friend's bicycle, just to experience
the different feel of it.

the initial speech at the ceremony of twelve was made by the
chief elder, the leader of the community who was elected every ten
years. the speech was much the same each year: recollection of
the time of childhood and the period of preparation, the coming
responsibilities of adult life, the profound importance of assignment,
the seriousness of training to come.

then the chief elder moved ahead in her speech. "this is the
time," she began, looking directly at them, "when we acknowledge
differences. you elevens have spent all your years till now learning

nothing that he recognized as himself, jonas. finally the chief
elder paid tribute to the hard work of her committee, which had
performed the observations so meticulously all year. the
committee of elders stood and was acknowledged by applause.
jonas noticed asher yawn slightly, covering his mouth politely with
his hand.

then, at last, the chief elder called number one to the stage, and
the assignments began.

each announcement was lengthy, accompanied by a speech
directed at the new twelve. jonas tried to pay attention as one,
smiling happily, received her assignment as fish hatchery
attendant along with words of praise for her childhood spent doing
many volunteer hours there, and her obvious interest in the
important process of providing nourishment for the community.

nt as instructor of sixes,
which obviously pleased him and was well deserved. now there
were three assignments gone, none of them ones that jonas would
have liked not that he could have been a birthmother, anyway, he
realized with amusement. he tried to sort through the list in his
mind, the possible assignments that remained. but there were so
many he gave it up; and anyway, now it was asher's turn. he paid
strict attention as his friend went to the stage and stood self-
consciously beside the chief elder.

"all of us in the community know and enjoy asher," the chief elder
began. asher grinned and scratched one leg with the other foot.
the audience chuckled softly.

"when the committee began to consider asher's assignment," she
went on, "there were some possibilities that were immediately
discarded. some that would clearly not have been right for asher.

"for example," she said, smiling, "we did not consider for an instant
designating asher an instructor of threes."

the audience howled

with laughter. asher laughed, too, looking
sheepish but pleased at the special attention. the instructors of
threes were in charge of the acquisition of correct language.

"in fact," the chief elder continued, chuckling a little herself, "we
even gave a little thought to some retroactive chastisement for the
one who had been asher's instructor of threes so long ago. at the
meeting where asher was discussed, we retold many of the stories




that we all remembered from his days of language acquisition.

"especially," she said, chuckling, "the difference between snack
and smack. remember, asher?"

asher nodded ruefully, and the audience laughed aloud. jonas did,
too. he remembered, though he

but the next morning he had done it again. and again the following
week. he couldn't seem to stop, though for each lapse the
discipline wand came again, escalating to a series of painful lashes
that left marks on asher's legs. eventually, for a period of time,
asher stopped talking altogether, when he was a three.

"for a while," the chief elder said, relating the story, "we had a
silent asher! but he learned."

she turned to him with a smile. "when he began to talk again, it
was with greater precision. and now his lapses are very few. his
corrections and apologies are very prompt. and his good humor is
unfailing." the audience murmured in agreement. asher's cheerful
disposition was well-known throughout the community.

"asher." she lifted her voice to make the official announcement.
"we have given you the assignment of assista

she clipped on his new badge as he stood beside her, beaming.
then he turned and left the stage as the audience cheered. when
he had taken his seat again, the chief elder looked down at him
and said the words that she had said now four times, and would
say to each new twelve. somehow she gave it special meaning for
each of them.

"asher," she said, "thank you for your childhood."

the assignments continued, and jonas watched and listened,
relieved now by the wonderful assignment his best friend had been
given. but he was more and more apprehensive as his own
approached. now the new twelves in the row ahead had all
received their badges. they were fingering them

nervous, but fiona was a calm female. she had been sitting quietly,
serenely, throughout the ceremony.

even the applause, though enthusiastic, seemed serene when
fiona was given the important assignment of caretaker of the old.
it was perfect for such a sensitive, gentle girl, and her smile was
satisfied and pleased when she took her seat beside him again.



57



jonas prepared himself to walk to the stage when the applause
ended and the chief elder picked up the next folder and looked
down to the group to call forward the next new twelve. he was
calm now that his turn had come. he took a deep breath and
smoothed his hair with his hand.

"twenty," he heard her voice say clearly. "pierre."

she skipped me, jonas thought, stunned. had he heard wrong?
no. there was a sudden hush in the crowd, and he knew that the
entire community realized that the chief elder had moved from
eighteen to twenty, leaving a gap. on his right, pierre, with a

he felt dizzy, and couldn't focus his attention. he didn't hear what
assignment pierre received, and was only dimly aware of the
applause as the boy returned, wearing his new badge. then:
twenty-one. twenty-two.

the numbers continued in order. jonas sat, dazed, as they moved
into the thirties and then the forties, nearing the end. each time, at
each announcement, his heart jumped for a moment, and he
thought wild thoughts. perhaps now she wou

the audience was clearly ill at ease. they applauded at the final
assignment; but the applause was piecemeal, no longer a
crescendo of united enthusiasm. there were murmurs of confusion.

jonas moved his hands together, clapping, but it was an automatic,



meaningless gesture that he wasn't even aware of. his mind had
shut out all of the earlier emotions: the anticipation, excitement,
pride, and even the happy kinship with his friends. now he felt only
humiliation and terror.

the chief elder waited until the uneasy applause subsided. then
she spoke again.

"i know," she said in her vibrant, gracious voice, "that you are all
concerned. that you feel i have made a mistake."

she smiled. the community, relieved from its discomfort very
slightly by her benign statement, seemed to breathe more easily. it
was very silent.

jonas looked up.

"i have caused you anxiety," she said. "i apologize to my
community." her voice flowed over the assembled crowd.

"we accept your apology," t

she went on. "jonas has been selected."

he blinked. what did that mean? he felt a collective, questioning
stir from the audience. they, too, were puzzled.

in a firm, commanding voice she announced, "jonas has been
selected to be our next receiver of memory."

then he heard the gasp-the sudden intake of breath, drawn
sharply in astonishment, by each of the seated citizens. he saw
their faces; the eyes widened in awe.

and still he did not understand.

"such a selection is very, very rare," the chief elder told the
audience. "our community has only one receiver. it is he who
trains his successor.

"we have had our current receiver for a very long time," she went
on. jonas followed her eyes and saw that

she was looking at one of the elders. the committee of elders was
sitting together in a group; and the chief elder's eyes were now on
one who sat in the midst but seemed oddly separate from them. it
was a man jonas had never noticed before, a bearded man with
pale eyes. he was watching jon

as intently.



"we failed in our last selection," the chief elder said solemnly. "it
was ten years ago, when jonas was just a toddler. i will not dwell
on the experience because it causes us all terrible discomfort."

jonas didn't know what she was referring to, but he could sense the
discomfort of the audience. they shifted uneasily in their seats.

"we have not been hasty this time," she continued. "we could not
afford another failure."

"sometimes," she went on, speaking now in a lighter tone, relaxing
the tension in the auditorium, "we are not entirely ce

the selection must be sound. it must be a unanimous choice of the
committee. they can have no doubts, however fleeting. if, during
the process, an elder reports a dream of uncertainty, that dream
has the power to set a candidate aside instantly.

"jonas was identified as a possible receiver many years ago. we
have observed him meticulously. there were no dreams of



uncertainty.

"he has shown all of the qualities that a receiver must have."

with her hand still firmly on his shoulder, the chief elder listed the
qualities.

"intelligence," she said. "we are all aware that jonas has been a
top student throughout his school days.

"integrity," she said next. "jonas has, like all of us, committed minor
transgressions." she smiled at him. "we expect that. we hoped,
also, that he would present himself promptly for chastisement, and
he has always done so.

" courage ," she went on. "only one of us here today has ever
undergone the rigorous training required of a receiver. he, of
course, is the mos

ident, and its
accompanying misery.




"but you will be faced, now," she explained gently, "with pain of a
magnitude that none of us here can comprehend because it is
beyond our experience. the receiver himself was not able to
describe it, only to remind us that you would be faced with it, that
you would need immense courage. we cannot prepare you for that.

"but we feel certain that you are brave," she said to him.

he did not feel brave at all. not now.

"the fourth essential attribute," the chief elder said, "is wisdom.
jonas has not yet acquired that. the acquisition of wisdom will
come through his training.

"we are convinced that jonas has the ability to acquire wisdom.
that is what we looked for.

"finally, the receiver must have one more quality, and it is one
which i can only name, but not describe. i do not understand it. you
members of the community will not understand it, either. perhaps
jonas will, because the current receiver has told us that jonas
already has this quality. he call

s it the capacity to see beyond."

the chief elder looked at jonas with a question in her eyes. the
audience watched him, too. they were silent.

for a moment he froze, consumed with despair. he didn't have it,
the whatever-she-had-said. he didn't know what it was. now was
the moment when he would have to confess, to say, "no, i don't. i
can't, "and throw himself on their mercy, ask their forgiveness, to
explain that he had been wrongly chosen, that he was not the right
one at all.





but when he looked out across the crowd, the sea of faces,

they changed.

he blinked, and it was gone. his shoulders straightened slightly.
briefly he felt a tiny sliver of sureness for the first time.

she was still watching him. they all were.

"i think it's true," he told the chief elder and the community. "i don't
understand it yet. i don't know what it is. but sometimes i see
something. and maybe it's beyond."

she took her arm from his shoulders.

"jonas," she said, speaking not to him alone but to the entire
community of which he was a part, "you will be trained to be our
next receiver of memory. we thank you for your childhood."

then she turned and left the stage, left him there alone, standing
and facing the crowd, which began spontaneously the collective
murmur of his n

n louder, faster. "jonas. jonas. jonas." with the chant,
jonas knew, the community was accepting him and his new role,
giving him life, the way they had given it to the newchild caleb. his
heart swelled with gratitude and pride.

but at the same time he was filled with fear. he did not know what
his selection meant. he did not know what he was to become.

or what would become of him.





now, for the first time in his twelve years of life, jonas felt separate,
different. he remembered what the chief elder had said: that his
training would be alone and apart.

but his training had not yet begun and already, upon leaving the
auditorium, he felt the apartness. holding the folder she had given
him, he made his way through the throng, looking for his family unit
and for asher. people moved aside for him. they watched him. he
thought he could hear whispers.

"ash!" he called, spotting his friend near the rows of bicycles. "ride
back with me?"

"sure." asher smiled, his usual smile, friendly and famili

name.



"i can't wait for tomorrow to come," she said happily.
jonas sighed uneasily. "i can," he muttered.


"you've been greatly honored," his mother said. "your father and i
are very proud."

"it's the most important job in the community," father said.

"but just the other night, you said that the job of making
assignments was the most important!"

mother nodded. "this is different. it's not a job, really. i never
thought, never expected--" she paused. "there's only one
receiver."

"but the chief elder said that they had made a selection before,
and that it failed. what was she talking about?"

both of his parents hesitated. finally his father described the
previous selection. "it was very much as it was today, jonas- the
same suspense, as one eleven had been passed over when the
assignments were given. then the announcement, when they
singled out the one-"

jonas interrupted. "what was his name?"

his mother replied, "her, not his. it was a female. but we are never

the throb which was, now, all he could recall of the experience.

re-reading rule number 6, he realized that a crushed finger fell into
the category of "unrelated to training." so if it ever happened again-
-and he was quite certain it wouldn't; he had been very careful near
heavy doors since the accident!-he could still receive medication.

the pill he took now, each morning, was also unrelated to training.
so he would continue to receive the pill.

but he remembered uneasily what the chief elder had said about
the pain that would come with his training. she had called it
indescribable.

jonas swallowed hard, trying without success to imagine what such
pain might be like, with no medication at all. but it was beyond his
comprehension.

he felt no reaction to rule number 7 at all. it had never occurred to
him that under any circumstances, ever, he might apply for release.

finally he steeled himself to read the final rule again. he had been
trained since earliest childhood, since his ear

he wondered what lay in the far distance where he had never gone.
the land didn't end beyond those nearby communities. were there
hills elsewhere? were there vast

wind-torn areas like the place he had seen in memory, the place
where the elephant died?

"giver," he asked one afternoon following a day when he had been
sent away, "what causes you pain?"

when the giver was silent, jonas continued. "the chief elder told
me, at the beginning, that the receiving of memory causes terrible
pain. and you described for me that the failure of the last new
receiver released painful memories to the community.

"but i haven't suffered, giver. not really." jonas smiled. "oh, i
remember the sunburn you gave me on the very first day. but that
wasn't so terrible. what is it that makes you suffer so much? if you
gave some of it to me, maybe your pain would be less."

the giver nodded. "lie down," he said. "it's time, i

but the giver said no, and looked away.

limping, jonas walked home, pushing his bicycle, that evening.
the sunburn pain had been so small, in comparison, and had not
stayed with him. but this ache lingered.



it was not unendurable, as the pain on the hill had been. jonas
tried to be brave. he remembered that the chief elder had said he
was brave.

"is something wrong, jonas?" his father asked at the evening meal.
"you're so quiet tonight. aren't you feeling well? would you like
some medication?"

but jonas remembered the rules. no medication for anything
related to his training.

and no discussion of his training. at the time for sharing-of-feelings,
he simply said that he felt tired, that his school lessons had been
unusually demanding that day.

he went to his sleepingroom early, and from behind the closed door

lily grinned. "i have a better idea for one more story," she
announced. "what if actually we were all twins and didn't know it,
and so elsewhere there would be another lily, and another jonas,
and another father, and another asher, and another chief elder,
and another--"



father groaned. "lily," he said. "it's bedtime."

"giver," jonas asked the next afternoon, "do you ever think about
release?"

"do you mean my own release, or just the general topic of
release?"

"both, i guess. i apologi— i mean i should have been more precise.
but i don't know exactly what i meant."

"sit back up. no need to lie down while we're talking." jonas, who
had already been stretched out on the bed when the question came
to his mind, sat back up.

you-by transferring something happy and cheerful. but the times of
laughter were gone by then. she stood up very silently, frowning,
as if she were making a decision. then she came over to me and
put her arms around me. she kissed my cheek." as jonas watched,
the giver stroked his own cheek, recalling the touch of rosemary's
lips ten years before.

"she left here that day, left this room, and did not go back to her
dwelling. i was notified by the speaker that she had gone directly to


the chief elder and asked to be released."

"but it's against the rules! the receiver-in-training can't apply for
rel-"

"it's in your rules, jonas. but it wasn't in hers. she asked for
release, and they had to give it to her. i never saw her again."

so that was the failure, jonas thought. it was obvious that it
saddened the giver very deeply. but it didn't seem such a terrible
thing, after all. and he, jonas, would never have done it~never
have requested release, no matter now difficult his training became.
