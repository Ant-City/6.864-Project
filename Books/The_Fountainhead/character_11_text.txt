na be an architect?"

"yes."

"well, you'll be the first one that knows something besides pretty pictures and tea parties. you 
should see the teacher's pets they send us down from the office."

"if you're apologizing, don't. i don't like them either. go back to the pipes. so long."

"so long, red."

the next time roark appeared on that job, the blue-eyed electrician waved to him from afar, 
and called him over, and asked advice about his work which he did not need; he stated that 
his name was mike and that he had missed roark for several days. on the next visit the day 
shift was just leaving, and mike waited outside for roark to finish the inspection. "how about a 
glass of beer, red?" he invited, when roark came out. "sure," said roark, "thanks."

they sat together at a table in the corner of a basement speakeasy, and they drank beer, and 
mike related his favorite tale of how he had fallen five stories when a scaffolding gave way 
under him, how he had broken three ribs but lived to t

ell it, and roark spoke of his days in the 
building trades. mike did have a real name, which was sean xavier donnigan, but everyone 
had forgotten it long ago; he owned a set of tools and an ancient ford, and existed for the sole 
purpose of traveling around the country from one big construction job to another. people 
meant very little to mike, but their performance a great deal. he worshipped expertness of any 
kind. he loved his work passionately and had no tolerance for anything save for other single-
track devotions. he was a master in his own field and he felt no sympathy except for mastery. 
his view of the world was simple: there were the able and there were the incompetent; he was 
not concerned with the latter. he loved buildings. he despised, however, all architects.

"there was one, red," he said earnestly, over his fifth

beer, "one only and you'd be too young 
to know about him, but that was the only man that knew building. i worked for him when i was 
your age."

"who was that?"

"henry cameron was his name. he's dead, i guess, these many years."

roark looked at him for a long time, then said: "he's not dead, mike," and added: "i've worked 
for him."

"you did?"

"for almost three years."

they looked at each other silently, and that was the final seal on their friendship.

weeks later, mike stopped roark, one day, at the building, his ugly face puzzled, and asked:

"say, red, i heard the super tell a guy from the contractor's that you're stuck-up and stubborn 
and the lousiest bastard he's ever been up against. what did you do to him?"

"nothing."

"what the hell did he mean?"

"i don't know," said roark. "do you?"

mike looked at him, shrugged and grinned.

"no," said mike.

"i'm not criticizing anything," said roark quietly. "i'm not passing judgment. there are some 
things that i can't do. let it go at that. may i leave now?"

"you may leave this room and this firm now and from now on! you may go straight to the 
devil! go and find yourself another employer! try and find him! go get your check and get 
out!"

"yes, mr. francon."

that evening roark walked to the basement speak-easy where he could always find mike 
after the day's work. mike was now employed on the construction of a factory by the same 
contractor who was awarded most of francon's biggest jobs. mike had expected to see roark 
on an inspection visit to the factory that afternoon, and greeted him angrily:

"what's the matter, red? lying down on the job?"

when he heard the news, mike sat still and looked like a bulldog baring its teeth. then he 
swore savagely.

"the bastards," he gulped between stronger names, "the bastards..."

"keep sti

"well...what now, red?"

"someone else of the same kind, until the same thing happens again."

when keating returned from washington he went straight up to francon's office. he had not 
stopped in the drafting room and had heard no news. francon greeted him expansively:

"boy, it's great to see you back! what'll you have? a whisky-and-soda or a little brandy?"

"no, thanks. just give me a cigarette."

"here....boy, you look fine! better than ever. how do you do it, you lucky bastard? i hav

feet and 
went bouncing down the hill, resonant drops of sound rolling in the sunny clarity of the 
summer air.

he stood on the summit, his legs planted wide apart, leaning back against space. he looked 
at the materials before him, the knobs of rivets in steel, the sparks in blocks of stone, the 
weaving spirals in fresh, yellow planks.

then he saw a husky figure enmeshed in electric wires, a bulldog face spreading into a huge 
grin and china-blue eyes gloating in a kind of unholy triumph.

"mike!" he said incredulously.

mike had left for a big job in philadelphia months ago, long before the appearance of heller in 
snyte's office, and mike had never heard the news--or so he supposed.

"hello, red," said mike, much too casually, and added: "hello, boss."

"mike, how did you...?"

"you're a hell of an architect. neglecting the job like that. it's my third day here, waiting for you 
to show up."

"mike, how did you get here? why such a come-down?" he had never known mike to bother 
with

 small private residences.

"don't play the sap. you know how i got here. you didn't think i'd miss it, your first house, did 
you? and you think it's a come-down? well, maybe it is. and maybe it's the other way around."

roark extended his hand and mike's grimy fingers closed about it ferociously, as if the 
smudges he left implanted in roark's skin said everything he wanted to say. and because he 
was afraid that he might say it, mike growled:

"run along, boss, run along. don't clog up the works like that."

roark walked through the house. there were moments when he could be precise, 
impersonal, and stop to give instructions as if this were not his house but only a mathematical 
problem; when he felt the existence of pipes and rivets, while his own person vanished.

there were moments when something rose within him, not a thought nor a feeling, but a wave 
of some physical violence, and then he wanted to stop, to lean back

office, to stand at a table, forcing himself 
to stay away from the construction site. at the site there were moments when he wished to 
forget his office and his drawing board, to seize the men's tools and go to work on the actual 
erection of the house, as he had worked in his childhood, to build that house with his own 
hands.

he walked through the structure, stepping lightly over piles of planks and coils of wire, he 
made notes, he gave brief orders in a harsh voice. he avoided looking in mike's direction. but 
mike was watching him, following his progress through the house. mike winked at him in 
understanding, whenever he passed by. mike said once:

"control yourself, red. you're open like a book. god, it's indecent to be so happy!"

roark stood on the cliff, by the structure, and looked at the countryside, at the long, gray 
ribbon of the road twisting past along the shore. an open car drove by, fleeing into the country. 
the car was overfilled with people bound for a picnic. the

ess."

roark smiled. he looked down at his drawings. his elbow moved a little, pressing them to his 
body. he said:

"that was the most selfish thing you've ever seen a man do."

he walked back to his office. he gathered his drawing instruments and the few things he had 
there. it made one package and he carried it under his arm. he locked the door and gave the 
key to the rental agent. he told the agent that he was closing his office. he walked home and 
left the package there. then he went to mike donnigan's house.

"no?" mike asked, after one look at him.

"no," said roark.

"what happened?"

"i'll tell you some other time."

"the bastards!"

"never mind that, mike."

"how about the office now?"

"i've closed the office."

"for good?"

"for the time being."

"god damn them all, red! god damn them!"

"shut up. i need a job, mike. can you help me?"

"me?"

"i don't know anyone in those trades here. not anyone that would want me. you know them 
all."

"in what trades? what are you talking

about?"

"in the building trades. structural work. as i've done before."

"you mean--a plain workman's job?"

"i mean a plain workman's job."

"you're crazy, you god-damn fool!"

"cut it, mike. will you get me a job?"

"but why in hell? you can get a decent job in an architect's office. you know you can."

"i won't, mike. not ever again."

"why?"

"i don't want to touch it. i don't want to see it. i don't want to help them do what they're doing."

"you can get a nice clean job in some other line."

"i would have to think on a nice clean job. i don't want to think. not their way. it will have to be 
their way, no matter where i go. i want a job where i won't have to think."

"architects don't take workmen's jobs."

"that's all this architect can do."

"you can learn something in no time."

"i don't want to learn

 anything."

"you mean you want me to get you into a construction gang, here, in town?"

"that's what i mean."

"no, god damn you! i can't! i won't! i won't do it!"

"why?"

"red, to be putting yourself up like a show for all the bastards in this town to see? for all the 
sons of bitches to know they brought you down like this? for all of them to gloat?"

roark laughed.

"i don't give a damn about that, mike. why should you?"

"well, i'm not letting you. i'm not giving the sons of bitches that kinda treat."

"mike," roark said softly, "there's nothing else for me to do."

"hell, yes, there is. i told you before. you'll be listening to reason now. i got all the dough you 
need until..."

"i'll tell you what i've told austen heller: if you ever offer me money again, that'll be the end 
between us."

"but why?"

"don't argue, mike."

"but..."

"i'm asking you to do me a bigger favor. i want that job.

you don't have to feel sorry for me. i 
don't."

"but...but what'll happen to you, red?"

"where?"

"i mean...your future?"

"i'll save enough money and i'll come back. or maybe someone will send for me before then."

mike looked at him. he saw something in roark's eyes which he knew roark did not want to 
be there.

"okay, red," said mike softly.

he thought it over for a long time. he said:

"listen, red, i won't get you a job in town. i just can't. it turns my stomach to think of it. but i'll 
get you something in the same line."

"all right. anything. it doesn't make any difference to me."

"i've worked for all of that bastard francon's pet contractors for so long i know everybody ever 
worked for him. he's got a granite quarry down in connecticut. one of the foremen's a great 
pal of mine. he's in town right now. ever worked

 in a quarry before?"

"once. long ago."

"think you'll like that?"

"sure."

"i'll go see him. we won't be telling him who you are, just a friend of mine, that's all."

"thanks, mike."

mike reached for his coat, and then his hands fell back, and he looked at the floor.

"red..."

"it will be all right, mike."

roark walked home. it was dark and the street was deserted. there was a strong wind. he 
could feel the cold, whistling pressure strike his cheeks. it was the only evidence of the flow 
ripping the air. nothing moved in the stone corridor about him. there was not a tree to stir, no 
curtains, no awnings; only naked masses of stone, glass, asphalt and sharp corners. it was 
strange to feel that fierce movement against his face. but in a trash basket on a corner a 
crumpled sheet of newspaper

 it hurt him too much: the wrench 
of helplessness before the vision of what he could do, what should have been possible and 
was closed to him. then, without reason, he thought of dominique francon. she had no 
relation to the things in his mind; he was shocked only to know that she could remain present 
even among these things.

a week passed. then, one evening, he found a letter waiting for him at home. it had been 
forwarded from his former office to his last new york address, from there to mike, from mike 
to connecticut. the engraved address of an oil company on the envelope meant nothing to 
him. he opened the letter. he read:
#
"dear mr. roark,

"i have been endeavoring for some time to get in touch with you, but have been unable to 
locate you. please communicate with me at your earliest convenience. i should like to discuss 
with you my proposed enright house, if you are the man who built the fargo store.

"sincerely yours,

"roger enright."

half an hour later roark was on a t

"hold it, dominique!" he cried. "hold it! hold it!"

he was at his stand before the cigarette hit the ground. he worked, and dominique stood 
without moving, and roark stood facing her, leaning against the wall.

in april the walls of the temple rose in broken lines over the ground. on moonlit nights they 
had a soft, smeared, underwater glow. the tall fence stood on guard around them.

after the day's work, four people would often remain at the site--roark, mallory, dominique 
and mike donnigan. mike had not missed employment on a single building of roark's.

the four of them sat together in mallory's shack, after all the others had left. a wet cloth 
covered the unfinished statue. the door of the shack stood open to the first warmth of a 
spring night. a tree branch hung outside, with three new leaves against the black sky, stars 
trembling like drops of water on the edges of the leaves. there were no chairs in the shack. 
mallory stood at the cast-iron stove, fixing hot dog

s and coffee. mike sat on the model's stand, 
smoking a pipe. roark lay stretched out on the floor, propped up on his elbows, dominique 
sat on a kitchen stool, a thin silk robe wrapped about her, her bare feet on the planks of the 
floor.

they did not speak about their work. mallory told outrageous stories and dominique laughed 
like a child. they talked about nothing in particular, sentences that had meaning only in the 
sound of the voices, in the warm gaiety, in the ease of complete relaxation. they were sim

a.g.a. rich and heavy on top. there were distinguished men and well-
dressed, tight-lipped women; each woman seemed to feel an exclusive proprietorship of the 
art practiced by her escort, a monopoly guarded by resentful glances at the others. almost 
everybody knew almost everybody else. the room had the atmosphere of a convention, an 
opening night and a family picnic. there was a feeling of "our bunch,"

"our boys,"

"our show."

steven mallory, austen heller, roger enright, kent lansing and mike sat together in one 
corner. they tried not to look around them. mike was worried about steven mallory. he kept 
close to mallory, insisted on sitting next to him and glanced at him whenever a particularly 
offensive bit of conversation reached them. mallory noticed it at last, and said: "don't worry, 
mike. i won't scream. i won't shoot anyone."

"watch your stomach, kid," said mike, "just watch your stomach. a man can't get sick just 
because he oughta."

"mike, do you remember the night when

ition. the total effect is that of..."

"louder please, mr. keating."

"the total effect is that of crudeness and architectural illiteracy. it shows...it shows no sense of 
structure, no instinct for beauty, no creative imagination, no..." he closed his eyes, "...artistic 
integrity..."

"thank you, mr. keating. that is all."

the attorney turned to roark and said nervously:

"your witness."

"no questions," said roark.

this concluded the first day of the trial.

that evening mallory, heller, mike, enright and lansing gathered in roark's room. they had 
not consulted one another, but they all came, prompted by the same feeling. they did not talk 
about the trial, but there was no strain and no conscious avoidance of the subject. roark sat 
on his drafting table and talked to them about the future of the plastics industry. mallory 
laughed aloud suddenly, without apparent reason. "what's the matter, steve?" roark asked. "i 
just thought...howard, we all came here to help you, to cheer you

vering it up with an old fig leaf of logic just for the sake of the 
mentally lazy layman."

john erik snyte testified modestly and unobtrusively that he had employed roark in his office, 
that roark had been an unreliable, disloyal and unscrupulous employee, and that roark had 
started his career by stealing a client from him.

on the fourth day of the trial the plaintiff's attorney called his last witness.

"miss dominique francon," he announced solemnly.

mallory gasped, but no one heard it; mike's hand clamped down on his wrist and made him 
keep still.

the attorney had reserved dominique for his climax, partly because he expected a great deal 
from her, and partly because he was worried; she was the only unrehearsed witness; she had 
refused to be coached. she had never mentioned the stoddard temple in her column; but he 
had looked up her earlier writings on roark; and ellsworth toohey had advised him to call her.

dominique stood for a moment on the elevation of the witness stand,

d the fountains and all the sculpture work of 
monadnock valley. but he came to live at the site long before he was needed. battle, thought 
steven mallory, is a vicious concept. there is no glory in war, and no beauty in crusades of 
men. but this was a battle, this was an army and a war--and the highest experience in the life 
of every man who took part in it. why? where was the root of the difference and the law to 
explain it? he did not speak of it to anyone. but he saw the same feeling in mike's face, when 
mike arrived with the gang of electricians. mike said nothing, but he winked at mallory in 
cheerful understanding. "i told you not to worry," mike said to him once, without preamble, "at 
the trial that was. he can't lose, quarries or no quarries, trials or no trials. they can't beat him, 
steve, they just can't, not the whole goddamn world."

but they had really forgotten the world, thought mallory. this was a new earth, their own. the 
hills rose to the sky around them, as a wa

ce went over dominique as over the rest of the courtroom. when he sat 
down, he looked at roark. from the moment of wynand's entrance roark's eyes kept 
returning to him. whenever roark looked at him, wynand turned away.

"the motive which the state proposes to prove," the prosecutor was making his opening 
address to the jury, "is beyond the realm of normal human emotions. to the majority of us it 
will appear monstrous and inconceivable."

dominique sat with mallory, heller, lansing, enright, mike--and guy francon, to the shocked 
disapproval of his friends. across the aisle, celebrities formed a comet: from the small point of 
ellsworth toohey, well in front, a tail of popular names stretched through the crowd: lois 
cook, gordon l. prescott, gus webb, lancelot clokey, ike, jules fougler, sally brent, homer 
slottern, mitchell layton.

"even as the dynamite which swept a building away, his motive blasted all sense of humanity 
out of this man's soul. we are dealing, gentlemen of the jur
