nd benefactor had for some time interrupted, an accident
happened, which with sorrow we relate, and with sorrow doubtless will
it be read; however, that historic truth to which we profess so
inviolable an attachment, obliges us to communicate it to posterity.

it was now a pleasant evening in the latter end of june, when our
heroe was walking in a most delicious grove, where the gentle breezes
fanning the leaves, together with the sweet trilling of a murmuring
stream, and the melodious notes of nightingales, formed altogether the
most enchanting harmony. in this scene, so sweetly accommodated to
love, he meditated on his dear sophia. while his wanton fancy roamed
unbounded over all her beauties, and his lively imagination painted
the charming maid in various ravishing forms, his warm heart melted
with tenderness; and at length, throwing himself on the ground, by the
side of a gently murmuring brook, he broke forth into the following
ejaculation:

‚Äúo sophia, would heaven give thee to my arms, ho

  noses.

the master, foaming with wrath, ordered his man immediately to strip,
to which the latter very readily agreed, on condition of receiving his
wages. this condition was presently complied with, and the fellow was
discharged.

and now the young gentleman, whose name was nightingale, very
strenuously insisted that his deliverer should take part of a bottle
of wine with him; to which jones, after much entreaty, consented,
though more out of complacence than inclination; for the uneasiness of
his mind fitted him very little for conversation at this time. miss
nancy likewise, who was the only female then in the house, her mamma
and sister being both gone to the play, condescended to favour them
with her company.

when the bottle and glasses were on the table the gentleman beg

wards each other, with which they had separated the evening before;
but poor jones was extremely disconsolate; for he had just received
information from partridge, that mrs fitzpatrick had left her lodging,
and that he could not learn whither she was gone. this news highly
afflicted him, and his countenance, as well as his behaviour, in
defiance of all his endeavours to the contrary, betrayed manifest
indications of a disordered mind.

the discourse turned at present, as before, on love; and mr
nightingale again expressed many of those warm, generous, and
disinterested sentiments upon this subject, which wise and sober men
call romantic, but which wise and sober women generally regard in a
better light. mrs miller (for so the mistress of the house was called)
greatly approved these sentiments; but when the young gentleman
appealed to miss nancy, she answered only, ‚Äúthat she believed the
gentleman who had spoke the least was capable of feeling most.‚Äù

this compliment was so apparently directed

but the maid persisting that she was certain of the
name, all the women were desirous of having the bundle immediately
opened; which operation was at length performed by little betsy, with
the consent of mr jones: and the contents were found to be a domino, a
mask, and a masquerade ticket.

jones was now more positive than ever in asserting, that these things
must have been delivered by mistake; and mrs miller herself expressed
some doubt, and said, ‚Äúshe knew not what to think.‚Äù but when mr
nightingale was asked, he delivered a very different opinion. ‚Äúall i
can conclude from it, sir,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúis, that you are a very happy
man; for i make no doubt but these were sent you by some lady whom you
will have the happiness of meeting at the masquerade.‚Äù

jones had not a sufficient degree of vanity to entertain any such
flattering imagination; nor did mrs miller herself give much assent to
what mr nightingale had said, till miss nancy having lifted up the
domino, a card dropt from the sleev

     use her favours not amiss.

mrs miller and miss nancy now both agreed with mr nightingale; nay,
jones himself was almost persuaded to be of the same opinion. and as
no other lady but mrs fitzpatrick, he thought, knew his lodging, he
began to flatter himself with some hopes, that it came from her, and
that he might possibly see his sophia. these hopes had surely very
little foundation; but as the conduct of mrs fitzpatrick, in not
seeing him according to her promise, and in quitting her lodgings, had
been very odd and unaccountable, he conceived some faint hopes, that
she (of whom he

should be so taken up by them, as to be stopt from further pursuits. i
make no manner of doubt but that, in this light, we may see the
imaginary future chancellor just called to the bar, the archbishop in
crape, and the prime minister at the tail of an opposition, more truly
happy than those who are invested with all the power and profit of
those respective offices.

mr jones having now determined to go to the masquerade that evening,
mr nightingale offered to conduct him thither. the young gentleman, at
the same time, offered tickets to miss nancy and her mother; but the
good woman would not accept them. she said, ‚Äúshe did not conceive the
harm which some people imagined in a masquerade; but that such
extravagant diversions were proper only for persons of quality and
fortune, and not for young women who were to get their living, and
could, at best, hope to be married to a good tradesman.‚Äù----‚Äúa

u shan‚Äôt undervalue my nancy. there
is not a nobleman upon earth above her merit.‚Äù ‚Äúo fie! mr
nightingale,‚Äù answered mrs miller, ‚Äúyou must not fill the girl‚Äôs head
with such fancies: but if it was her good luck‚Äù (says the mother with
a simper) ‚Äúto find a gentleman of your generous way of thinking, i
hope she would make a better return to his generosity than to give her
mind up to extravagant pleasures. indeed, where young ladies bring
great fortunes themselves, they have some right to insist on spending
what is their own; and on that account i have heard the gentlemen say,
a man has somet

 she did not dare
openly to oppose them. for as this good woman had all the tenderness,
so she had preserved all the authority of a parent; and as her
indulgence to the desires of her children was restrained only by her
fears for their safety and future welfare, so she never suffered those
commands which proceeded from such fears to be either disobeyed or
disputed. and this the young gentleman, who had lodged two years in
the house, knew so well, that he presently acquiesced in the refusal.

mr nightingale, who grew every minute fonder of jones, was very
desirous of his company that day to dinner at the tavern, where he
offered to introduce him to some of his acquaintance; but jones begged
to be excused, ‚Äúas his cloaths,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwere not yet come to town.‚Äù

to confess the truth, mr jones was now in a situation, which sometimes
happens to be the case of young gentlemen of much better figure than
himself. in short, he had not one penny in his pocket; a situation in
much greater credit am

o converse with you any more.‚Äô‚Äù

here passion stopt the mouth of jones, as surprize for a moment did
that of partridge; but he soon recovered the use of speech, and after
a short preface, in which he declared he had no inquisitiveness in his
temper, enquired what jones meant by a considerable sum--he knew not
how much--and what was become of the money.

in both these points he now received full satisfaction; on which he
was proceeding to comment, when he was interrupted by a message from
mr nightingale, who desired his master‚Äôs company in his apartment.

when the two gentlemen were both attired for the masquerade, and mr
nightingale had given orders for chairs to be sent for, a circumstance
of distress occurred to jones, which will appear very ridiculous to
many of my readers. this was how to procure a shilling; but if such
readers will reflect a little on what they have themselves felt from
the want of a thousand pounds, or, perhaps, of ten or twenty, to
execute a favourite scheme, they wi

containing the whole humours of a masquerade.


our cavaliers now arrived at that temple, where heydegger, the great
arbiter deliciarum, the great high-priest of pleasure, presides; and,
like other heathen priests, imposes on his votaries by the pretended
presence of the deity, when in reality no such deity is there.

mr nightingale, having taken a turn or two with his companion, soon
left him, and walked off with a female, saying, ‚Äúnow you are here,
sir, you must beat about for your own game.‚Äù

jones began to entertain strong hopes that his sophia was present; and
these hopes gave him more spirits than the lights, the music, and the
company; though these are pretty strong antidotes against the spleen.
he now accosted every woman he saw, whose stature, shape, or air, bore
any resemblance to his angel. to all of whom he

ople rude truths, and by endeavouring, as the phrase is, to
spoil as much sport as they are able. this good lady, therefore,
having observed jones, and his friend, whom she well knew, in close
consultation together in a corner of the room, concluded she could
nowhere satisfy her spleen better than by interrupting them. she
attacked them, therefore, and soon drove them from their retirement;
nor was she contented with this, but pursued them to every place which
they shifted to avoid her; till mr nightingale, seeing the distress of
his friend, at last relieved him, and engaged the old woman in another
pursuit.

while jones and his mask were walking together about the room, to rid
themselves of the teazer, he observed his lady speak to several masks,
with the same freedom of acquaintance as if they had been barefaced.
he could not help expressing his surprize at this; saying, ‚Äúsure,
madam, you must have infinite discernment, to know people in all
disguises.‚Äù to which the lady answered, ‚Äúyou ca

llaston, can hardly
imagine any other.

to clear, therefore, the honour of mr jones, and to do justice to the
liberality of the lady, he had really received this present from her,
who, though she did not give much into the hackney charities of the
age, such as building hospitals, &c., was not, however, entirely void
of that christian virtue; and conceived (very rightly i think) that a
young fellow of merit, without a shilling in the world, was no
improper object of this virtue.

mr jones and mr nightingale had been invited to dine this day with mrs
miller. at the appointed hour, therefore, the two young gentlemen,
with the two girls, attended in the parlour, where they waited from
three till almost five before the good woman appeared. she had been
out of town to visit a relation, of whom, at her return, she gave the
following account.

‚Äúi hope, gentlemen, you will pardon my making you wait; i am sure if
you knew the occasion--i have been to see a cousin of mine, about six
miles off, who now lie

ther, in a cold room, without any curtains to her bed, and
not a bushel of coals in her house to supply her with fire; her second
son, that sweet little fellow, lies ill of a quinzy in the same bed
with his mother; for there is no other bed in the house. poor little
tommy! i believe, nancy, you will never see your favourite any more;
for he is really very ill. the rest of the children are in pretty good
health: but molly, i am afraid, will do herself an injury: she is but
thirteen years old, mr nightingale, and yet, in my life, i never saw a
better nurse: she tends both her mother and her brother; and, what is
wonderful in a creature so young, she shows all the chearfulness in
the world to her mother; and yet i saw her--i saw the poor child, mr
nightingale, turn about, and privately wipe the tears from her eyes.‚Äù
 here mrs miller was prevented, by her own tears, from going on, and
there was not, i believe, a person present who did not accompany her
in them; at length she a little recovered hers

an, his countenance is the very picture of horror, and he looks like
one rather dead than alive. oh heavens! what a scene did i behold at
my first coming into the room! the good creature was lying behind the
bolster, supporting at once both his child and his wife. he had
nothing on but a thin waistcoat; for his coat was spread over the bed,
to supply the want of blankets.--when he rose up at my entrance, i
scarce knew him. as comely a man, mr jones, within this fortnight, as
you ever beheld; mr nightingale hath seen him. his eyes sunk, his face
pale, with a long beard. his body shivering with cold, and worn with
hunger too; for my cousin says she can hardly prevail upon him to
eat.--he told me himself in a whisper--he told me--i can‚Äôt repeat
it--he said he could not bear to eat the bread his children wanted.
and yet, can you believe it, gentlemen? in all this misery his wife
has as good caudle as if she lay in the midst of the greatest
affluence; i tasted it, and i scarce ever tasted better.--t

nes, ‚Äúthere are many who have
common humanity; for to relieve such distresses in our fellow-creatures,
can hardly be called more.‚Äù mrs miller then took ten guineas, which
were the utmost he could prevail with her to accept, and said, ‚Äúshe
would find some means of conveying them early the next morning;‚Äù
 adding, ‚Äúthat she had herself done some little matter for the poor
people, and had not left them in quite so much misery as she found
them.‚Äù

they then returned to the parlour, where nightingale expressed much
concern at the dreadful situation of these wretches, whom indeed he
knew; for he had seen them more than once at mrs miller‚Äôs. he
inveighed against the folly of making oneself liable for the debts of
others; vented many bitter execrations against the brother; and
concluded with wishing something could be done for the unfortunate
family. ‚Äúsuppose, madam,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúyou should recommend them to mr
allworthy? or what think you of a collection? i will give them a
guinea with

all my heart.‚Äù

mrs miller made no answer; and nancy, to whom her mother had whispered
the generosity of jones, turned pale upon the occasion; though, if
either of them was angry with nightingale, it was surely without
reason. for the liberality of jones, if he had known it, was not an
example which he had any obligation to follow; and there are thousands
who would not have contributed a single halfpenny, as indeed he did
not in effect, for he made no tender of anything; and therefore, as
the others thought proper to make no demand, he kept his money in his
pocket.

i have, in truth, observed, and shall never have a better opportunity
than at present to communicate my observation, that

  but will be at home by that time. a day, i find, to those that

  ‚Äúif you should accidentally be a few moments before me, bid them
  show you into the drawing-room.‚Äù

to confess the truth, jones was less pleased with this last epistle
than he had been with the former, as he was prevented by it from
complying with the earnest entreaties of mr nightingale, with whom he
had now contracted much intimacy and friendship. these entreaties were
to go with that young gentleman and his company to a new play, which
was to be acted that evening, and which a very large party had agreed
to damn, from some dislike they had taken to the author, who was a
friend to one of mr nightingale‚Äôs acquaintance. and this sort of fun,
our heroe, we are ashamed to confess, would willingly have preferred
to the above kind appointment; but his honour got the better of his

the simplicity of partridge set jones a laughing, and put a final end
to his anger, which had indeed seldom any long duration in his mind;
and, instead of commenting on his defence, he told him he intended
presently to leave those lodgings, and ordered him to go and endeavour
to get him others.

which we hope will be very attentively perused by young people of both
sexes.


partridge had no sooner left mr jones than mr nightingale, with whom
he had now contracted a great intimacy, came to him, and, after a
short salutation, said, ‚Äúso, tom, i hear you had company very late
last night. upon my soul you are a happy fellow, who have not been in
town above a fortnight, and can keep chairs waiting at your door till
two in the morning.‚Äù he then ran on with much commonplace raillery of
the same kind, till jones at last interrupted him, saying, ‚Äúi suppose
you have received all this information from mrs miller, who hath been

up here a little while ago to give me warning. the good woman is
afraid, it seems, of the reputation of her daughters.‚Äù ‚Äúoh! she is
wonderfully nice,‚Äù says nightingale, ‚Äúupon that account; if you
remember, she would not let nancy go with us to the masquerade.‚Äù ‚Äúnay,
upon my honour, i think she‚Äôs in the right of it,‚Äù says jones:
‚Äúhowever, i have taken her at her word, and have sent partridge to
look for another lodging.‚Äù ‚Äúif you will,‚Äù says nightingale, ‚Äúwe may, i
believe, be again together; for, to tell you a secret, which i desire
you won‚Äôt mention in the family, i intend to quit the house to-day.‚Äù
 ‚Äúwhat, hath mrs miller given you warning too, my friend?‚Äù cries jones.
‚Äúno,‚Äù answered the other; ‚Äúbut the rooms are not convenient enough.
besides, i am grown weary of this part of the town. i want to be
nearer the places of diversion; so i am going to pall-mall.‚Äù ‚Äúand do
you intend to make a secret of your going away?‚Äù sai

d jones. ‚Äúi
promise you,‚Äù answered nightingale, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt intend to bilk my
lodgings; but i have a private reason for not taking a formal leave.‚Äù
 ‚Äúnot so private,‚Äù answered jones; ‚Äúi promise you, i have seen it ever
since the second day of my coming to the house. here will be some wet
eyes on your departure. poor nancy, i pity her, faith! indeed, jack,
you have played the fool with that girl. you have given her a longing,
which i am afraid nothing will ever cure her of.‚Äù nightingale
answered, ‚Äúwhat the devil would you have me do? would you have me
marry her to cure her?‚Äù ‚Äúno,‚Äù answered jones, ‚Äúi would not have had
you make love to her, as you have often done in my presence. i have
been astonished at the blindness of her mother in never seeing it.‚Äù
 ‚Äúpugh, see it!‚Äù cries nightingale. ‚Äúwhat, the devil should she see?‚Äù
 ‚Äúwhy, see,‚Äù said jones, ‚Äúthat you have made her daughter distractedly
in love with you. the poor girl cannot conceal it a moment; he

are never off from you, and she always colours every time you come
into the room. indeed, i pity her heartily; for she seems to be one of
the best-natured and honestest of human creatures.‚Äù ‚Äúand so,‚Äù answered
nightingale, ‚Äúaccording to your doctrine, one must not amuse oneself
by any common gallantries with women, for fear they should fall in
love with us.‚Äù ‚Äúindeed, jack,‚Äù said jones, ‚Äúyou wilfully misunderstand
me; i do not fancy women are so apt to fall in love; but you have gone
far beyond common gallantries.‚Äù ‚Äúwhat, do you suppose,‚Äù says
nightingale, ‚Äúthat we have been a-bed together?‚Äù ‚Äúno, upon my honour,‚Äù
 answered jones, very seriously, ‚Äúi do not suppose so ill of you; nay,

you have actually given her reason to flatter herself that you had the
most serious designs in her favour. prithee, jack, answer me honestly;
to what have tended all those elegant and luscious descriptions of
happiness arising from violent and mutual fondness? all those warm
professions of tenderness, and generous disinterested love? did you
imagine she would not apply them? or, speak ingenuously, did not you
intend she should?‚Äù ‚Äúupon my soul, tom,‚Äù cries nightingale, ‚Äúi did not
think this was in thee. thou wilt make an admirable parson. so i
suppose you would not go to bed to nancy now, if she would let you?‚Äù
 ‚Äúno,‚Äù cries jones, ‚Äúmay i be d--n‚Äôd if i would.‚Äù ‚Äútom, tom,‚Äù answered
nightingale, ‚Äúlast night; remember last night----

     when every eye was closed, and the pale moon,
     and silent stars, shone conscious of the theft.‚Äù

‚Äúlookee, mr nightingale,‚Äù said jones, ‚Äúi am no canting hypocrite, nor
do i pretend to the gift of
 
 ___________________________
 
 chastity, more than my neighbours. i have
been guilty with women, i own it; but am not conscious that i have
ever injured any.--nor would i, to procure pleasure to myself, be
knowingly the cause of misery to any human being.‚Äù

‚Äúwell, well,‚Äù said nightingale, ‚Äúi believe you, and i am convinced you
acquit me of any such thing.‚Äù

‚Äúi do, from my heart,‚Äù answered jones, ‚Äúof having debauched the girl,
but not from having gained her affections.‚Äù

‚Äúif i have,‚Äù said nightingale, ‚Äúi am sorry for it; but time and
absence will soon wear off such impressions. it is a receipt i must
take myself; for, to confess the truth to you--i never liked any girl
half so much in my whole life; but i must let you into the whole
secret, tom. my father hath provided a match for me with a woman i
never saw; and she is now coming to town, in order for me to make my
addresses to her.‚Äù

at these words jones burst into a loud fit of laughter; when
nightingale cried--‚Äúnay, prithee, don‚Ä
 
 ___________________________
 
ôt turn me into ridicule. the
devil take me if i am not half mad about this matter! my poor nancy!
oh! jones, jones, i wish i had a fortune in my own possession.‚Äù

‚Äúi heartily wish you had,‚Äù cries jones; ‚Äúfor, if this be the case, i
sincerely pity you both; but surely you don‚Äôt intend to go away
without taking your leave of her?‚Äù

‚Äúi would not,‚Äù answered nightingale, ‚Äúundergo the pain of taking
leave, for ten thousand pounds; besides, i am convinced, instead of
answering any good purpose, it would only serve to inflame my poor
nancy the more. i beg, therefore, you would not mention a word of it
to-day, and in the evening, or to-morrow morning, i intend to depart.‚Äù

jones promised he would not; and said, upon reflection, he thought, as
he had determined and was obliged to leave her, he took the most
prudent method. he then told nightingale he should be 
 
 ___________________________
 
very glad to
lodge in the same house with him; and it was accordingly agreed
between them, that nightingale should procure him either the ground
floor, or the two pair of stairs; for the young gentleman himself was
to occupy that which was between them.

this nightingale, of whom we shall be presently obliged to say a
little more, was in the ordinary transactions of life a man of strict
honour, and, what is more rare among young gentlemen of the town, one
of strict honesty too; yet in affairs of love he was somewhat loose in
his morals; not that he was even here as void of principle as
gentlemen sometimes are, and oftener affect to be; but it is certain
he had been guilty of some indefensible treachery to women, and had,
in a certain mystery, called making love
 
 ___________________________
 
of
dispelling his slumbers. in fact, poor jones was one of the
best-natured fellows alive, and had all that weakness which is called
compassion, and which distinguishes this imperfect character from that
noble firmness of mind, which rolls a man, as it were, within himself,
and like a polished bowl, enables him to run through the world without
being once stopped by the calamities which happen to others. he could
not help, therefore, compassionating the situation of poor nancy,
whose love for mr nightingale seemed to him so apparent, that he was
astonished at the blindness of her mother, who had more than once, the
preceding evening, remarked to him the great change in the temper of
her daughter, ‚Äúwho from being,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúone of the liveliest,
merriest girls in the world, was, on a sudden, become all gloom and
melancholy.‚Äù

sleep, however, at length got the better of all resistance; and now,
as if he had already been a deity, as the antients imagined, and an
offended one too, he seemed

 my child! my child! she is undone, she is ruined for ever!‚Äù
 ‚Äúi hope, madam,‚Äù said jones, ‚Äúno villain‚Äù----‚Äúo mr jones!‚Äù said she,
‚Äúthat villain who yesterday left my lodgings, hath betrayed my poor
girl; hath destroyed her.--i know you are a man of honour. you have a
good--a noble heart, mr jones. the actions to which i have been myself
a witness, could proceed from no other. i will tell you all: nay,
indeed, it is impossible, after what hath happened, to keep it a
secret. that nightingale, that barbarous villain, hath undone my
daughter. she is--she is--oh! mr jones, my girl is with child by him;
and in that condition he hath deserted her. here! here, sir, is his
cruel letter: read it, mr jones, and tell me if such another monster
lives.‚Äù

the letter was as follows:

  ‚Äúdear nancy,

  ‚Äúas i found it impossible to mention to you what, i am afraid, will
  be no less shocking to you, than it is to me, i have taken this
  method to inform you, that my father insists upon my im

 says she, ‚Äúyou may go
in, for your sister is better, and longs to see you.‚Äù she then turned
to jones, and began to renew her apologies for having disappointed him
of his breakfast.

‚Äúi hope, madam,‚Äù said jones, ‚Äúi shall have a more exquisite repast
than any you could have provided for me. this, i assure you, will be
the case, if i can do any service to this little family of love. but
whatever success may attend my endeavours, i am resolved to attempt
it. i am very much deceived in mr nightingale, if, notwithstanding
what hath happened, he hath not much goodness of heart at the bottom,
as well as a very violent affection for your daughter. if this be the
case, i think the picture which i shall lay before him will affect
him. endeavour, madam, to comfort yourself, and miss nancy, as well as
you can. i will go instantly in quest of mr nightingale; and i hope to
bring you good news.‚Äù

mrs miller fell upon her knees and invoked all the blessings of heaven
upon mr jones; to which she after
 
 ___________________________
 
wards added the most passionate
expressions of gratitude. he then departed to find mr nightingale, and
the good woman returned to comfort her daughter, who was somewhat
cheared at what her mother told her; and both joined in resounding the
praises of mr jones.



chapter vii.

the interview between mr jones and mr nightingale.


the good or evil we confer on others very often, i believe, recoils on
ourselves. for as men of a benign disposition enjoy their own acts of
beneficence equally with those to whom they are done, so there are
scarce any natures so entirely diabolical, as to be capable of doing
injuries, without paying themselves some pangs for the ruin which they
bring on their fellow-creatures.

mr nightingale, at least, was not such a person. on the contrary,
jones found him in his new lodgings, sitting mel
 
 ___________________________
 
uation in which he had placed
poor nancy. he no sooner saw his friend appear than he arose hastily
to meet him; and after much congratulation said, ‚Äúnothing could be
more opportune than this kind visit; for i was never more in the
spleen in my life.‚Äù

‚Äúi am sorry,‚Äù answered jones, ‚Äúthat i bring news very unlikely to
relieve you: nay, what i am convinced must, of all other, shock you
the most. however, it is necessary you should know it. without further
preface, then, i come to you, mr nightingale, from a worthy family,
which you have involved in misery and ruin.‚Äù mr nightingale changed
colour at these words; but jones, without regarding it, proceeded, in
the liveliest manner, to paint the tragical story with which the
reader was acquainted in the last chapter.

nightingale never once interrupted the narration, though he discovered
violent emotions at many parts of it. but when it was concluded, after
fetching a deep sigh, he said, ‚Äúwhat you tell me, my friend, affects
me in the tend

en in this town: and if the husband should suspect a
little, when it is too late, it will be his wiser conduct to conceal
his suspicion both from his wife and the world.‚Äù

‚Äúindeed, my friend,‚Äù answered jones, ‚Äúthis could not have been the
case with your poor nancy. you have so entirely gained her affections,
that it is the loss of you, and not of her reputation, which afflicts
her, and will end in the destruction of her and her family.‚Äù ‚Äúnay, for
that matter, i promise you,‚Äù cries nightingale, ‚Äúshe hath my
affections so absolutely, that my wife, whoever she is to be, will
have very little share in them.‚Äù ‚Äúand is it possible then,‚Äù said
jones, ‚Äúyou can think of deserting her?‚Äù ‚Äúwhy, what can i do?‚Äù
 answered the other. ‚Äúask miss nancy,‚Äù replied jones warmly. ‚Äúin the
condition to which you have reduced her, i sincerely think she ought
to determine what reparation you shall make her. her interest alone,
and not yours, ought to be your sole consideration. but if yo

heart will best suggest to you, whether you have never intended, by
your conduct, to persuade the mother, as well as the daughter, into an
opinion, that you designed honourably: and if so, though there may
have been no direct promise of marriage in the case, i will leave to
your own good understanding, how far you are bound to proceed.‚Äù

‚Äúnay, i must not only confess what you have hinted,‚Äù said nightingale;

 ‚Äúand can you, after owning that,‚Äù said jones, ‚Äúhesitate a moment?‚Äù
 ‚Äúconsider, my friend,‚Äù answered the other; ‚Äúi know you are a man of

were no other objection, can i, after this publication of her
disgrace, think of such an alliance with honour?‚Äù ‚Äúundoubtedly,‚Äù
 replied jones, ‚Äúand the very best and truest honour, which is

creature is a tender, helpless, defenceless, young woman? a young
woman, who loves, who doats on you, who dies for you; who hath placed
the utmost confidence in your promises; and to that confidence hath
sacrificed everything which is dear to her? can honour support such
contemplations as these a moment?‚Äù

‚Äúcommon sense, indeed,‚Äù said nightingale, ‚Äúwarrants all you say; but
yet you well know the opinion of the world is so contrary to it, that,
was i to marry a whore, though my own, i should be ashamed of ever
showing my face again.‚Äù

‚Äúfie upon it, mr nightingale!‚Äù said jones, ‚Äúdo not call her by so
ungenerous a name: when you promised to marry her she became your
wife; and she hath sinned more against prudence than virtue. and what
is this world which you would be ashamed to face but the vile, the
foolish, and the profligate?

 i am mistaken in my friend if it
requires any long deliberation whether he will sink these wretches
down for ever, or, by one generous, noble resolution, raise them all
from the brink of misery and despair to the highest pitch of human
happiness. add to this but one consideration more; the consideration
that it is your duty so to do--that the misery from which you will
relieve these poor people is the misery which you yourself have
wilfully brought upon them.‚Äù

‚Äúo, my dear friend!‚Äù cries nightingale, ‚Äúi wanted not your eloquence
to rouse me. i pity poor nancy from my soul, and would willingly give
anything in my power that no familiarities had ever passed between us.
nay, believe me, i had many struggles with my passion before i could
prevail with myself to write that cruel letter, which hath caused all
the misery in that unhappy family. if i had no inclinations to consult

he could be persuaded, would you yourself consent to the only means of

within these twelve hours for my poor girl, i am convinced she would
not engross all your pity. passion leads me only to her; and, if i had
any foolish scruples of honour, you have fully satisfied them: could
my father be induced to comply with my desires, nothing would be
wanting to compleat my own happiness or that of my nancy.‚Äù

nightingale immediately consented to the proposal; and now, having
acquainted jones with his father‚Äôs lodging, and the coffee-house where
he would most probably find him, he hesitated a moment, and then said,
‚Äúmy dear tom, you are going to undertake an impossibility. if you knew
my father you would never think of obtaining his consent.----stay,

old gentleman.

what passed between jones and old mr nightingale; with the arrival of
a person not yet mentioned in this history.


notwithstanding the sentiment of the roman satirist, which denies the
divinity of fortune, and the opinion of seneca to the same purpose;
cicero, who was, i believe, a wiser man than either of them, expressly
holds the contrary; and certain it is, there are some incidents in
life so very strange and unaccountable, that it seems to require more
than human skill and foresight in producing them.

of this kind was what now happened

the elder in so critical a minute, that fortune, if she was really
worthy all the worship she received at rome, could not have contrived
such another. in short, the old gentleman, and the father of the young
lady whom he intended for his son, had been hard at it for many hours;
and the latter was just now gone, and had left the former delighted
with the thoughts that he had succeeded in a long contention, which
had been between the two fathers of the future bride and bridegroom;
in which both e

there is scarce anything which so happily introduces men to our good
liking, as having conceived some alarm at their first appearance; when
once those apprehensions begin to vanish we soon forget the fears
which they occasioned, and look on ourselves as indebted for our
present ease to those very persons who at first raised our fears.

thus it happened to nightingale, who no sooner found that jones had no
demand on him, as he suspected, than he began to be pleased with his
presence. ‚Äúpray, good sir,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúbe pleased to sit down. i do not
remember to have ever had the pleasure of seeing you before; but if
you are a friend of my son, and have anything to say concerning this
young lady, i shall be glad to hear you. as to her making him happy,
it will be his own fault if she doth not. i have discharged my duty,

by her he had four children, but none of them arrived at maturity,
except only one daughter, whom, in vulgar language, he and his wife
had spoiled; that is, had educated with the utmost tenderness and
fondness, which she returned to such a degree, that she had actually
refused a very extraordinary match with a gentleman a little turned of
forty, because she could not bring herself to part with her parents.

the young lady whom mr nightingale had intended for his son was a near
neighbour of his brother, and an acquaintance of his niece; and in
reality it was upon the account of his projected match that he was now
come to town; not, indeed, to forward, but to dissuade his brother
from a purpose which he conceived would inevitably ruin his nephew;
for he foresaw no other event from a union with miss harris,
notwithstanding the largeness of her fortune, as neither her person
nor mind seemed to him to promise any kind of matrimonial fel

mr nightingale, the father, instead of attempting to answer his

differed in their sentiments concerning the education of their
children. ‚Äúi wish,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúbrother, you would have confined your

jones fell into raptures with this good gentleman; and when, after
much persuasion, they found the father grew still more and more
irritated, instead of appeased, jones conducted the uncle to his
nephew at the house of mrs miller.



chapter ix.

containing strange matters.


at his return to his lodgings, jones found the situation of affairs
greatly altered from what they had been in at his departure. the
mother, the two daughters, and young mr nightingale, were now sat down
to supper together, when the uncle was, at his own desire, introduced
without any ceremony into the company, to all of whom he was well
known; for he had several times visited his nephew at that house.

the old gentleman immediately walked up to miss nancy, saluted and
wished her joy, as he did afterwards the mother and the other sister;
and lastly, he paid the proper compliments to his nephew, with the
same good humour and courtesy, as if his nephew had married his equal

g-room, she threw herself at his feet, and in a most
passionate flood of tears, called him her good angel, the preserver of
her poor little family, with many other respectful and endearing
appellations, and made him every acknowledgment which the highest
benefit can extract from the most grateful heart.

after the first gust of her passion was a little over, which she
declared, if she had not vented, would have burst her, she proceeded
to inform mr jones that all matters were settled between mr
nightingale and her daughter, and that they were to be married the
next morning; at which mr jones having expressed much pleasure, the
poor woman fell again into a fit of joy and thanksgiving, which he at
length with difficulty silenced, and prevailed on her to return with
him back to the company, whom they found in the same good humour in
which they had left them.

this little society now past two or three very agreeable hours
together, in which the uncle, who was a very great lover of his
bottle, had so

well plyed his nephew, that this latter, though not
drunk, began to be somewhat flustered; and now mr nightingale, taking
the old gentleman with him upstairs into the apartment he had lately
occupied, unbosomed himself as follows:--

‚Äúas you have been always the best and kindest of uncles to me, and as
you have shown such unparalleled goodness in forgiving this match,
which to be sure may be thought a little improvident, i should never
forgive myself if i attempted to deceive you in anything.‚Äù he then
confessed the truth, and opened the whole affair.

‚Äúhow, jack?‚Äù said the old gentleman, ‚Äúand are

nightingale, ‚Äúi have told you the simple truth.‚Äù ‚Äúmy dear boy,‚Äù cries
the uncle, kissing him, ‚Äúi am heartily glad to hear it. i never was
better pleased in my life. if you had been married i should have
assisted you as much as was in my power to have made the best of a bad
matter; but there is a great difference between considering a thing
which is already done and irrecoverable, and that which is yet to do.

dissuasive arguments.‚Äù ‚Äúhow, sir?‚Äù replies young nightingale, ‚Äúis
there this difference between having already done an act, and being in
honour engaged to do it?‚Äù ‚Äúpugh!‚Äù said the uncle, ‚Äúhonour is a
creature of the world‚Äôs making, and the world hath the power of a
creator over it, and may govern and direct it as they please. now you
well know how trivial these breaches of contract are thought; even the
grossest make but the wonder and conversation of a day. is there a man

concerned. i am well satisfied, that, was i now to disappoint the
young creature, her death would be the consequence, and i should look
upon myself as her murderer; nay, as her murderer by the cruellest of
all methods, by breaking her heart.‚Äù ‚Äúbreak her heart, indeed! no, no,

my advice, nor ever refuses to take it when i give it her.‚Äù ‚Äúyou have
never yet given her advice in an affair of this kind,‚Äù said
nightingale; ‚Äúfor i am greatly mistaken in my cousin, if she would be
very ready to obey even your most positive commands in abandoning her
inclinations.‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt abuse my girl,‚Äù answered the old gentleman with
some emotion; ‚Äúdon‚Äôt abuse my harriet. i have brought her up to have
no inclinations contrary to my own. by suffering her to do whatever
she pleases, i have enured her to a habit of being pleased to do
whatever i like.‚Äù ‚Äúpardon, me, sir,‚Äù said nightingale, ‚Äúi have not the

hard commands on her as you would do on me.--but,
dear sir, let us return to the company; for they will begin to be
uneasy at our long absence. i must beg one favour of my dear uncle,
which is that he would not say anything to shock the poor girl or her
mother.‚Äù ‚Äúoh! you need not fear me,‚Äù answered he, ‚Äúi understand myself
too well to affront women; so i will readily grant you that favour;
and in return i must expect another of you.‚Äù ‚Äúthere are but few of
your commands, sir,‚Äù said nightingale, ‚Äúwhich i shall not very
chearfully obey.‚Äù ‚Äúnay, sir, i ask nothing,‚Äù said the uncle, ‚Äúbut the
honour of your company home to my lodging, that i may reason the case
a little more fully with you; for i would, if possible, have the
satisfaction of preserving my family, notwithstanding the headstrong
folly of my brother, who, in his own opinion, is the wisest man in the
world.‚Äù

nightingale, who well knew his uncle to be as headstrong as his
father, submitted to attend him home, and th

n a
whisper, that he would attend her early in the morning, and fulfil all
his engagements.

jones, who was the least concerned in this scene, saw the most. he did
indeed suspect the very fact; for, besides observing the great
alteration in the behaviour of the uncle, the distance he assumed, and
his overstrained civility to miss nancy; the carrying off a bridegroom
from his bride at that time of night was so extraordinary a proceeding
that it could be accounted for only by imagining that young
nightingale had revealed the whole truth, which the apparent openness
of his temper, and his being flustered with liquor, made too probable.

while he was reasoning with himself, whether he should acquaint these
poor people with his suspicion, the maid of the house informed him
that a gentlewoman desired to speak with him.----he went immediately
out, and, taking the candle from the maid, ushered his visitant
upstairs, who, in the person of mrs honour, acquainted him with such
dreadful news concerning his s

r yet more tragical, than this
scene would have been if it had lasted much longer. the lady had
already changed colour two or three times; had got up from the bed and
sat down again, while jones was wishing the ground to sink under him,
or the house to fall on his head, when an odd accident freed him from
an embarrassment out of which neither the eloquence of a cicero, nor
the politics of a machiavel, could have delivered him, without utter
disgrace.

this was no other than the arrival of young nightingale, dead drunk;
or rather in that state of drunkenness which deprives men of the use
of their reason without depriving them of the use of their limbs.

mrs miller and her daughters were in bed, and partridge was smoaking
his pipe by the kitchen fire; so that he arrived at mr jones‚Äôs
chamber-door without any interruption. this he burst open, and was
entering without any ceremony, when jones started from his seat and
ran to oppose him, which he did so effectually, that nightingale never
came far e

nough within the door to see who was sitting on the bed.

nightingale had in reality mistaken jones‚Äôs apartment for that in
which himself had lodged; he therefore strongly insisted on coming in,
often swearing that he would not be kept from his own bed. jones,
however, prevailed over him, and delivered him into the hands of
partridge, whom the noise on the stairs soon summoned to his master‚Äôs
assistance.

and now jones was unwillingly obliged to return to his own apartment,
where at the very instant of his entrance he heard lady bellaston
venting an exclamati

on, though not a very loud one; and at the same
time saw her flinging herself into a chair in a vast agitation, which
in a lady of a tender constitution would have been an hysteric fit.

in reality the lady, frightened with the struggle between the two men,
of which she did not know what would be the issue, as she heard
nightingale swear many oaths he would come to his own bed, attempted
to retire to her known place of hiding, which to her great confusion
she found already occupied by another.

‚Äúis this usage to be borne, mr jones?‚Äù cries the lady.--‚Äúbasest of
men?----what wretch is this to whom you have exposed me?‚Äù ‚Äúwretch!‚Äù
 cries honour, bursting in a violent rage from her place of
concealment--‚Äúmarry come up!----wretch forsooth?----as poor a wretch
as i am, i am honest; this is more than some folks who

ended, thankfully received the admonition
of the good woman, expressed much concern for what had past, excused
it as well as he could, and promised never more to bring the same
disturbances into the house.

but though mrs miller did not refrain from a short expostulation in
private at their first meeting, yet the occasion of his being summoned
downstairs that morning was of a much more agreeable kind, being
indeed to perform the office of a father to miss nancy, and to give
her in wedlock to mr nightingale, who was now ready drest, and full as
sober as many of my readers will think a man ought to be who receives
a wife in so imprudent a manner.

and here perhaps it may be proper to account for the escape which this
young gentleman had made from his uncle, and for his appearance in the
condition in which we have seen him the night before.

now when the uncle had arrived at his lodgings with his nephew, partly
to indulge his own inclinations (for he dearly loved his bottle), and
partly to disqualif

ncerns.

this sudden and afflicting news was no less than that his daughter had
taken the opportunity of almost the first moment of his absence, and
had gone off with a neighbouring young clergyman; against whom, though
her father could have had but one objection, namely, that he was worth
nothing, yet she had never thought proper to communicate her amour
even to that father; and so artfully had she managed, that it had
never been once suspected by any, till now that it was consummated.

old mr nightingale no sooner received this account, than in the utmost
confusion he ordered a post-chaise to be instantly got ready, and,
having recommended his nephew to the care of a servant, he directly
left the house, scarce knowing what he did, nor whither he went.

the uncle thus departed, when the servant came to attend the nephew to
bed, had waked him for that purpose, and had at last made him sensible
that his uncle was gone, he, instead of accepting the kind offices
tendered him, insisted on a chair bei

ng called; with this the servant,
who had received no strict orders to the contrary, readily complied;
and, thus being conducted back to the house of mrs miller, he had
staggered up to mr jones‚Äôs chamber, as hath been before recounted.

this bar of the uncle being now removed (though young nightingale knew
not as yet in what manner), and all parties being quickly ready, the
mother, mr jones, mr nightingale, and his love, stept into a
hackney-coach, which conveyed them to doctors‚Äô commons; where miss
nancy was, in vulgar language, soon made an honest woman, and the poor
mother became, in the purest sense of the word, one of the happiest of
all human beings.

and now mr jones, having seen his good offices to that poor woman and
her family brought to a happy conclusion, began to apply himself to
his own concerns; but here, lest many of my readers should censure his
folly for thus troubling himself

----come to me
  presently.‚Äù

                              letter ii.

  ‚Äúif you ever expect to be forgiven, or even suffered within my
  doors, come to me this instant.‚Äù

                             letter iii.

  ‚Äúi now find you was not at home when my notes came to your lodgings.
  the moment you receive this let me see you;--i shall not stir out;
  nor shall anybody be let in but yourself. sure nothing can detain
  you long.‚Äù

jones had just read over these three billets when mr nightingale came
into the room. ‚Äúwell, tom,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúany news from lady bellaston,
after last night‚Äôs adventure?‚Äù (for it was now no secret to any one in
that house who the lady was). ‚Äúthe lady bellaston?‚Äù answered jones
very gravely.----‚Äúnay, dear tom,‚Äù cries nightingale, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be so
reserved to your friends. though i was too drunk to see her last
night, i saw her at the masquerade. do you think i am ignorant who the
queen of the fairies is?‚Äù ‚Äúand did you really then know the 
 
 ___________________________
 
lady at
the masquerade?‚Äù said jones. ‚Äúyes, upon my soul, did i,‚Äù said
nightingale, ‚Äúand have given you twenty hints of it since, though you
seemed always so tender on that point, that i would not speak plainly.
i fancy, my friend, by your extreme nicety in this matter, you are not
so well acquainted with the character of the lady as with her person.
don‚Äôt be angry, tom, but upon my honour, you are not the first young
fellow she hath debauched. her reputation is in no danger, believe
me.‚Äù

though jones had no reason to imagine the lady to have been of the
vestal kind wh
 
 ___________________________
 
en his amour began; yet, as he was thoroughly ignorant
of the town, and had very little acquaintance in it, he had no
knowledge of that character which is vulgarly called a demirep; that
is to say, a woman who intrigues with every man she likes, under the
name and appearance of virtue; and who, though some over-nice ladies
will not be seen with her, is visited (as they term it) by the whole
town, in short, whom everybody knows to be what nobody calls her.

when he found, therefore, that nightingale was perfectly acquainted
with his intrigue, and began to suspect that so scrupulous a delicacy
as he had hitherto observed was not quite necessary on the occasion,
he gave a latitude to his friend‚Äôs tongue, and desired him to speak
plainly what he knew, or had ever heard of the lady.

nightingale, who, in many other instances, was rather too effeminate
in his disposition, had a pretty strong inclination to tittle-tattle.
he had no sooner, therefore, received a full liberty of speaking from
jo
 
 ___________________________
 
nes, than he entered upon a long narrative concerning the lady;
which, as it contained many particulars highly to her dishonour, we
have too great a tenderness for all women of condition to repeat. we
would cautiously avoid giving an opportunity to the future
commentators on our works, of making any malicious application and of
forcing us to be, against our will, the author of scandal, which never
entered into our head.

jones, having very attentively heard all that nightingale had to say,
fetched a deep sigh; which the other, observing, cried, ‚Äúheyday! why,
thou art not in love, i hope! had i imagined my stories would have
affected you, i promise you should never have heard them.‚Äù ‚Äúo my dear
friend!‚Äù cries jones, ‚Äúi am so entangled with this woman, that i know
not how to extricate myself. in love, indeed! no, my friend, but i am
under obligations to her, and very great ones. since you know so much,
i will be very explicit with you. it is owing, perhaps, sol

ely to her,
that i have not, before this, wanted a bit of bread. how can i
possibly desert such a woman? and yet i must desert her, or be guilty
of the blackest treachery to one who deserves infinitely better of me
than she can; a woman, my nightingale, for whom i have a passion which
few can have an idea of. i am half distracted with doubts how to act.‚Äù
 ‚Äúand is this other, pray, an honourable mistress?‚Äù cries nightingale.
‚Äúhonourable!‚Äù answered jones; ‚Äúno breath ever yet durst sully her
reputation. the sweetest air is not purer, the limpid stream not
clearer, than her honour. she is all over, both in mind and body,
consummate perfection. she is the most beautiful creature in the
universe: and yet she is mistress of such noble elevated qualities,
that, though she is never from my thoughts, i scarce ever think of her
beauty but when i see it.‚Äù--‚Äúand can you, my good friend,‚Äù cries
nightingale, ‚Äúwith
 
 ___________________________
 
 such an engagement as this upon your hands,
hesitate a moment about quitting such a--‚Äù ‚Äúhold,‚Äù said jones, ‚Äúno
more abuse of her: i detest the thought of ingratitude.‚Äù ‚Äúpooh!‚Äù
 answered the other, ‚Äúyou are not the first upon whom she hath
conferred obligations of this kind. she is remarkably liberal where
she likes; though, let me tell you, her favours are so prudently
bestowed, that they should rather raise a man‚Äôs vanity than his
gratitude.‚Äù in short, nightingale proceeded so far on this head, and
told his friend so many stories of the lady, which he swore to the
truth of, that he entirely removed all esteem for her from the breast
of jones; and his gratitude was lessened in proportion. indeed, he
began to look on all the favours he had received rather as wages than
benefits, which depreciated not only her, but himself too in his own
conceit, and put him quite out of humour with both. from this disgust,
his mind, by a natural transition, turned towards

sophia; her virtue,
her purity, her love to him, her sufferings on his account, filled all
his thoughts, and made his commerce with lady bellaston appear still
more odious. the result of all was, that, though his turning himself
out of her service, in which light he now saw his affair with her,
would be the loss of his bread; yet he determined to quit her, if he
could but find a handsome pretence: which being communicated to his
friend, nightingale considered a little, and then said, ‚Äúi have it, my
boy! i have found out a sure method; propose marriage to her, and i
would venture hanging upon the success.‚Äù ‚Äúmarriage?‚Äù cries jones. ‚Äúay,
propose marriage,‚Äù answered nightingale, ‚Äúand she will declare off in
a moment. i knew a young fellow whom she kept formerly, who made the
offer to her in earnest, and was presently turned off for his pains.‚Äù

jones declared he could not venture the experiment. ‚Äúperhaps,‚Äù said
he, ‚Äúshe 
 
 ___________________________
 
may be less shocked at this proposal from one man than from
another. and if she should take me at my word, where am i then?
caught, in my own trap, and undone for ever.‚Äù ‚Äúno;‚Äù answered
nightingale, ‚Äúnot if i can give you an expedient by which you may at
any time get out of the trap.‚Äù----‚Äúwhat expedient can that be?‚Äù
 replied jones. ‚Äúthis,‚Äù answered nightingale. ‚Äúthe young fellow i
mentioned, who is one of the most intimate acquaintances i have in the
world, is so angry with her for some ill offices she hath since done
him, that i am sure he would, without any difficulty, give you a sight
of her letters; upon which you may decently break with her; and
declare off before the knot is tyed, if she should really be willing
to tie it, which i am convinced she will not.‚Äù

after some hesitation, jones, upon the strength of this assurance,
consented; but,

 as he swore he wanted the confidence to propose the
matter to her face, he wrote the following letter, which nightingale
dictated:--

  ‚Äúmadam,

  ‚Äúi am extremely concerned, that, by an unfortunate engagement
  abroad, i should have missed receiving the honour of your ladyship‚Äôs
  commands the moment they came; and the delay which i must now suffer
  of vindicating myself to your ladyship greatly adds to this
  misfortune. o, lady bellaston! what a terror have i been in for fear
  your reputation should be exposed by these perverse accidents! there
  is one only way to secure it. i need not name what that i

ightest, he was not, however, perfectly easy in his
mind. there was in this scheme too much of fallacy to satisfy one who
utterly detested every species of falshood or dishonesty: nor would
he, indeed, have submitted to put it in practice, had he not been
involved in a distressful situation, where he was obliged to be guilty
of some dishonour, either to the one lady or the other; and surely the
reader will allow, that every good principle, as well as love, pleaded
strongly in favour of sophia.

nightingale highly exulted in the success of his stratagem, upon which
he received many thanks and much applause from his friend. he
answered, ‚Äúdear tom, we have conferred very different obligations on
each other. to me you owe the regaining your liberty; to you i owe the
loss of mine. but if you are as happy in the one instance as i am in
the other, i promise you we are the two happiest fellows in england.‚Äù

the two gentlemen were now summoned down to dinner, where mrs miller,
who performed herself th

mope and pine, are as uneasy and restless as a murderer, who is afraid
of a ghost, or of the hangman.

mrs miller was one of these. she could not conceal her uneasiness at
this letter; with the contents of which she had no sooner acquainted
the company, and given some hints of her distress, than jones, her
good angel, presently relieved her anxiety. ‚Äúas for myself, madam,‚Äù
 said he, ‚Äúmy lodging is at your service at a moment‚Äôs warning; and mr
nightingale, i am sure, as he cannot yet prepare a house fit to
receive his lady, will consent to return to his new lodging, whither
mrs nightingale will certainly consent to go.‚Äù with which proposal
both husband and wife instantly agreed.

the reader will easily believe, that the cheeks of mrs miller began
again to glow with additional gratitude to jones; but, perhaps, it may
be more difficult to persuade him, that mr jones having in his last
speech called her daughter mrs nightingale (it being the firs

said; and agreed that a little distant behaviour might not be improper
to so forward a lover.

thus sophia, by a little well-directed flattery, for which surely none
will blame her, obtained a little ease for herself, and, at least, put
off the evil day. and now we have seen our heroine in a better
situation than she hath been for a long time before, we will look a
little after mr jones, whom we left in the most deplorable situation
that can be well imagined.



chapter v.

mrs miller and mr nightingale visit jones in the prison.


when mr allworthy and his nephew went to meet mr western, mrs miller
set forwards to her son-in-law‚Äôs lodgings, in order to acquaint him
with the accident which had befallen his friend jones; but he had
known it long before from partridge (for jones, when he left mrs
miller, had been furnished with a room in the same house with mr
nightingale). the good woman found her daughter under great affliction
on account of mr jones, whom having comforted as well as she cou

she set forwards to the gatehouse, where she heard he was, and where
mr nightingale was arrived before her.

the firmness and constancy of a true friend is a circumstance so
extremely delightful to persons in any kind of distress, that the
distress itself, if it be only temporary, and admits of relief, is
more than compensated by bringing this comfort with it. nor are
instances of this kind so rare as some superficial and inaccurate
observers have reported. to say the truth, want of compassion is not
to be numbered among our general faults. the black ingredient which
fouls our

what is perhaps more rare, a faithful servant. for partridge,
though he had many imperfections, wanted not fidelity; and though fear
would not suffer him to be hanged for his master, yet the world, i
believe, could not have bribed him to desert his cause.

while jones was expressing great satisfaction in the presence of his
friends, partridge brought an account that mr fitzpatrick was still
alive, though the surgeon declared that he had very little hopes. upon
which, jones fetching a deep sigh, nightingale said to him, ‚Äúmy dear
tom, why should you afflict yourself so upon an accident, which,
whatever be the consequence, can be attended with no danger to you,
and in which your conscience cannot accuse you of having been the
least to blame? if the fellow should die, what have you done more than
taken away the life of a ruffian in your own defence? so will the
coroner‚Äôs inquest certainly find it; and then you will be easily
admitted to bail; and, though you must undergo the form of a trial,
yet

xpence for all the chance
which he hath of the lady.‚Äù

‚Äúindeed, my dear friend, indeed,‚Äù answered jones, ‚Äúyou are an entire
stranger to the cause of my grief. if you was acquainted with the
story, you would allow my case admitted of no comfort. i apprehend no
danger from blifil. i have undone myself.‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt despair,‚Äù replied
mrs miller; ‚Äúyou know not what a woman can do; and if anything be in
my power, i promise you i will do it to serve you. it is my duty. my
son, my dear mr nightingale, who is so kind to tell me he hath
obligations to you on the same account, knows it is my duty. shall i
go to the lady myself? i will say anything to her you would have me
say.‚Äù

‚Äúthou best of women,‚Äù cries jones, taking her by the hand, ‚Äútalk not
of obligations to me;--but as you have been so kind to mention it,
there is a favour which, perhaps, may be in your power. i see you are
acquainted with the lady (how you came by your information i know
not), who sits, indeed, very near my hea

otwithstanding the
disturbances i have unfortunately occasioned in your house, for which
i heartily ask your pardon, i am not an abandoned profligate. though i
have been hurried into vices, i do not approve a vicious character,
nor will i ever, from this moment, deserve it.‚Äù

mrs miller expressed great satisfaction in these declarations, in the
sincerity of which she averred she had an entire faith; and now the
remainder of the conversation past in the joint attempts of that good
woman and mr nightingale to cheer the dejected spirits of mr jones, in
which they so far succeeded as to leave him much better comforted and
satisfied than they found him; to which happy alteration nothing so
much contributed as the kind undertaking of mrs miller to deliver his
letter to sophia, which he despaired of finding any means to
accomplish; for when black george produced the last from sophia, he
informed partridge that she had strictly charged him, on pain of
having it communicated to her father, not to bring

her any answer. he
was, moreover, not a little pleased to find he had so warm an advocate
to mr allworthy himself in this good woman, who was, in reality, one
of the worthiest creatures in the world.

after about an hour‚Äôs visit from the lady (for nightingale had been
with him much longer), they both took their leave, promising to return
to him soon; during which mrs miller said she hoped to bring him some
good news from his mistress, and mr nightingale promised to enquire
into the state of mr fitzpatrick‚Äôs wound, and likewise to find out
some of the persons who were present at the rencounter.

the former of these went directly in quest of sophia, whither we
likewise shall now attend her.



chapter vi.

in which mrs miller pays a visit to sophia.


access to the young lady was by no means difficult; for, as she lived
now on a perfect friendly footing with her aunt, she was at full
liberty to receive what visitants she pleased.

sophia was d

allworthy was pretty much moved with this speech, but it seemed not to
be with anger; for, after a short silence, taking mrs miller by the
hand, he said very affectionately to her, ‚Äúcome, madam, let us
consider a little about your daughter. i cannot blame you for
rejoicing in a match which promises to be advantageous to her, but you
know this advantage, in a great measure, depends on the father‚Äôs
reconciliation. i know mr nightingale very well, and have formerly had
concerns with him; i will make him a visit, and endeavour to serve you
in this matter. i believe he is a worldly man; but as this is an only
son, and the thing is now irretrievable, perhaps he may in time be
brought to reason. i promise you i will do all i can for you.‚Äù

many were the acknowledgments which the poor woman made to allworthy
for this kind and generous offer, nor could she refrain from taking
this occasion again to express her gratitude towards jo

measures; so prepare yourself, for to-morrow morning you shall

sophia remonstrated all she could; but her aunt was deaf to all she
said. in this resolution therefore we must at present leave her, as
there seems to be no hopes of bringing her to change it.



chapter ix.

what happened to mr jones in the prison.


mr jones passed about twenty-four melancholy hours by himself, unless
when relieved by the company of partridge, before mr nightingale
returned; not that this worthy young man had deserted or forgot his
friend; for, indeed, he had been much the greatest part of the time
employed in his service.

he had heard, upon enquiry, that the only persons who had seen the
beginning of the unfortunate rencounter were a crew belonging to a
man-of-war which then lay at deptford. to deptford therefore he went
in search of this crew, where he was informed that the men he sought
after were all gone ashore. he then traced them from place to pla

ce,
till at last he found two of them drinking together, with a third
person, at a hedge-tavern near aldersgate.

nightingale desired to speak with jones by himself (for partridge was
in the room when he came in). as soon as they were alone, nightingale,
taking jones by the hand, cried, ‚Äúcome, my brave friend, be not too
much dejected at what i am going to tell you----i am sorry i am the
messenger of bad news; but i think it my duty to tell you.‚Äù ‚Äúi guess
already what that bad news is,‚Äù cries jones. ‚Äúthe poor gentleman then
is dead.‚Äù--‚Äúi hope not,‚Äù answered nightingale. ‚Äúhe was alive this
morning; though i will not flatter you; i fear, from the accounts i
could get, that his wound is mortal. but if the affair be exactly as
yo

u told it, your own remorse would be all you would have reason to
apprehend, let what would happen; but forgive me, my dear tom, if i
entreat you to make the worst of your story to your friends. if you
disguise anything to us, you will only be an enemy to yourself.‚Äù

‚Äúwhat reason, my dear jack, have i ever given you,‚Äù said jones, ‚Äúto
stab me with so cruel a suspicion?‚Äù ‚Äúhave patience,‚Äù cries
nightingale, ‚Äúand i will tell you all. after the most diligent enquiry
i could make, i at last met with two of the fellows who were present
at this unhappy accident, and i am sorry to say, they do not relate
the story so much in your favour as you yourself have told it.‚Äù ‚Äúwhy,
what do they say?‚Äù cries jones. ‚Äúindeed what i am sorry to repeat, as
i am afraid of the consequence of it to you. they say that they were
at too great a distance to overhear any words that passed between you:
but they both
 
 ___________________________
 
 agree that the first blow was given by you.‚Äù ‚Äúthen, upon
my soul,‚Äù answered jones, ‚Äúthey injure me. he not only struck me
first, but struck me without the least provocation. what should induce
those villains to accuse me falsely?‚Äù ‚Äúnay, that i cannot guess,‚Äù said
nightingale, ‚Äúand if you yourself, and i, who am so heartily your
friend, cannot conceive a reason why they should belie you, what
reason will an indifferent court of justice be able to assign why they
should not believe them? i repeated the question to them several
times, and so did another gentleman who was present, who, i believe,
is a seafaring man, and who really acted a very friendly part by you;
for he begged them often to consider that there was the life of a man
in the case; and asked them over

to live with the reputation of a
murderer? if i had any friends (as, alas! i have none), could i have
the confidence to solicit them to speak in the behalf of a man
condemned for the blackest crime in human nature? believe me, i have
no such hope; but i have some reliance on a throne still greatly
superior; which will, i am certain, afford me all the protection i
merit.‚Äù

he then concluded with many solemn and vehement protestations of the
truth of what he had at first asserted.

the faith of nightingale was now again staggered, and began to incline
to credit his friend, when mrs miller appeared, and made a sorrowful
report of the success of her embassy; which when jones had heard, he
cried out most heroically, ‚Äúwell, my friend, i am now indifferent as
to what shall happen, at least with regard to my life; and if it be
the will of heaven that i shall make an atonement with that for the
blood i have spilt, i hope the divine goodness will one day suffer my
honour to be cleared, and that the wor

hich, as few readers would have been pleased to be present, so
few, i believe, will desire to hear it particularly related. we will,
therefore, pass on to the entrance of the turnkey, who acquainted
jones that there was a lady without who desired to speak with him when
he was at leisure.

jones declared his surprize at this message. he said, ‚Äúhe knew no lady
in the world whom he could possibly expect to see there.‚Äù however, as
he saw no reason to decline seeing any person, mrs miller and mr
nightingale presently took their leave, and he gave orders to have the
lady admitted.

if jones was surprized at the news of a visit from a lady, how greatly
was he astonished when he discovered this lady to be no other than mrs
waters! in this astonishment then we shall leave him awhile, in order
to cure the surprize of the reader, who will likewise, probably, not a
little wonder at the arrival of this lady.

who this mrs waters was, the reader pretty well knows; what she was,
he must be perfectly satisfi

 therefore suppress the rest
of this conversation, and only observe that it ended at last with
perfect innocence, and much more to the satisfaction of jones than of
the lady; for the former was greatly transported with the news she had
brought him; but the latter was not altogether so pleased with the
penitential behaviour of a man whom she had, at her first interview,
conceived a very different opinion of from what she now entertained of
him.

thus the melancholy occasioned by the report of mr nightingale was
pretty well effaced; but the dejection into which mrs miller had
thrown him still continued. the account she gave so well tallied with
the words of sophia herself in her letter, that he made not the least
doubt but that she had disclosed his letter to her aunt, and had taken
a fixed resolution to abandon him. the torments this thought gave him
were to be equalled only by a piece of news which fortune had yet in
store for him, and which we shall communicate in the second chapter of

jones, and something else,
perhaps, in which he was concerned, been removed, i much doubt whether
she would not have sacrificed herself to a man she did not like, to
have obliged her father. she promised him she would make it the whole
business of her life to oblige him, and would never marry any man
against his consent; which brought the old man so near to his highest
happiness, that he was resolved to take the other step, and went to
bed completely drunk.



chapter iii.

allworthy visits old nightingale; with a strange discovery that he
made on that occasion.


the morning after these things had happened, mr allworthy went,
according to his promise, to visit old nightingale, with whom his
authority was so great, that, after having sat with him three hours,
he at last prevailed with him to consent to see his son.

here an accident happened of a very extraordinary kind; one indeed of
those strange chances whence very good and grave men have concluded
that providence often interposes in the disco

very of the most secret
villany, in order to caution men from quitting the paths of honesty,
however warily they tread in those of vice.

mr allworthy, at his entrance into mr nightingale‚Äôs, saw black george;
he took no notice of him, nor did black george imagine he had
perceived him.

however, when their conversation on the principal point was over,
allworthy asked nightingale, whether he knew one george seagrim, and
upon what business he came to his house? ‚Äúyes,‚Äù answered nightingale,
‚Äúi know him very well, and a most extraordinary fellow he is, who, in
these days, hath been able to hoard up ¬£500 from renting a very small
estate of ¬£30 a year.‚Äù ‚Äúand is this the story which he hath told you?‚Äù
 cries allworthy. ‚Äúnay, it is true, i promise you,‚Äù said nightingale,
‚Äúfor i have the money now in my own hands, in five bank-bills, which i
am to lay out either in a mortgage, or in some purchase in the north
of england.‚Äù the bank-bills were no sooner produced at allw

desire than he blessed himself at the strangeness of the discovery. he
presently told nightingale that these bank-bills were formerly his,
and then acquainted him with the whole affair. as there are no men who
complain more of the frauds of business than highwaymen, gamesters,
and other thieves of that kind, so there are none who so bitterly
exclaim against the frauds of gamesters, &c., as usurers, brokers, and
other thieves of this kind; whether it be that the one way of cheating
is a discountenance or reflection upon the other, or that money, which
is the common mistress of all cheats, ma

kes them regard each other in
the light of rivals; but nightingale no sooner heard the story than he
exclaimed against the fellow in terms much severer than the justice
and honesty of allworthy had bestowed on him.

allworthy desired nightingale to retain both the money and the secret
till he should hear farther from him; and, if he should in the
meantime see the fellow, that he would not take the least notice to
him of the discovery which he had made. he then returned to his
lodgings, where he found mrs miller in a very dejected condition, on
account of the information she had received from her son-in-law. mr
allworthy, with great chearfulness, told her that he had much good
news to communicate; and, with little further preface, acqua

inted her
that he had brought mr nightingale to consent to see his son, and did
not in the least doubt to effect a perfect reconciliation between
them; though he found the father more sowered by another accident of
the same kind which had happened in his family. he then mentioned the
running away of the uncle‚Äôs daughter, which he had been told by the
old gentleman, and which mrs miller and her son-in-law did not yet
know.

the reader may suppose mrs miller received this account with great
thankfulness, and no less pleasure; but so uncom

ed on the black act; but said, as it was a matter of
some nicety, it would be proper to go to counsel. he said he was to
attend counsel presently upon an affair of mr western‚Äôs, and if mr
allworthy pleased he would lay the case before them.‚Äù this was agreed
to; and then mrs miller, opening the door, cried, ‚Äúi ask pardon, i did
not know you had company;‚Äù but allworthy desired her to come in,
saying he had finished his business. upon which mr dowling withdrew,
and mrs miller introduced mr nightingale the younger, to return thanks
for the great kindness done him by allworthy: but she had scarce
patience to let the young gentleman finish his speech before she
interrupted him, saying, ‚Äúo sir! mr nightingale brings great news
about poor mr jones: he hath been to see the wounded gentleman, who is
out of all danger of death, and, what is more, declares he fell upon
poor mr jones himself, and beat him. i am sure, sir, you would not
have mr jones be a coward. if i was a man myself, i am sure, if

any
man was to strike me, i should draw my sword. do pray, my dear, tell
mr allworthy, tell him all yourself.‚Äù nightingale then confirmed what
mrs miller had said; and concluded with many handsome things of jones,
who was, he said, one of the best-natured fellows in the world, and
not in the least inclined to be quarrelsome. here nightingale was
going to cease, when mrs miller again begged him to relate all the
many dutiful expressions he had heard him make use of towards mr
allworthy. ‚Äúto say the utmost good of mr allworthy,‚Äù cries
nightingale, ‚Äúis doing no more than strict justice, and can have no
merit in it: but indeed, i must say, no man can be more sensible of
the obligations he hath to so good a man than is poor jones. indeed,
sir, i am convinced the weight of your displeasure is the heaviest
burthen he lies under. he

often protested in the most solemn manner he hath never been
intentionally guilty of any offence towards you; nay, he hath sworn he
would rather die a thousand deaths than he would have his conscience

towards you. but i ask pardon, sir, i am afraid i presume to
intermeddle too far in so tender a point.‚Äù ‚Äúyou have spoke no more
than what a christian ought,‚Äù cries mrs miller. ‚Äúindeed, mr
nightingale,‚Äù answered allworthy, ‚Äúi applaud your generous friendship,
and i wish he may merit it of you. i confess i am glad to hear the
report you bring from this unfortunate gentleman; and, if that matter
should turn out to be as you represent it (and, indeed, i doubt
nothing of what you say), i may, perhaps, in time, be brought to think
better than lately i have of this young man; for this good gentlewoman

chapter v.

in which the history is continued.


mr allworthy, in his last speech, had recollected some tender ideas
concerning jones, which had brought tears into the good man‚Äôs eyes.
this mrs miller observing, said, ‚Äúyes, yes, sir, your goodness to this
poor young man is known, notwithstanding all your care to conceal it;
but there is not a single syllable of truth in what those villains
said. mr nightingale hath now discovered the whole matter. it seems
these fellows were employed by a lord, who is a rival of poor mr
jones, to have pressed him on board a ship.--i assure them i don‚Äôt
know who they will press next. mr nightingale here hath seen the
officer himself, who is a very pretty gentleman, and hath told him
all, and is very sorry for what he undertook, which he would never
have done, had he known mr jones to have been a gentleman; but he was
told that he was a common strolling vagabond.‚Äù

 
 ___________________________
 

allworthy stared at all this, and declared he was a stranger to every
word she said. ‚Äúyes, sir,‚Äù answered she, ‚Äúi believe you are.----it is
a very different story, i believe, from what those fellows told this
lawyer.‚Äù

‚Äúwhat lawyer, madam? what is it you mean?‚Äù said allworthy. ‚Äúnay, nay,‚Äù
 said she, ‚Äúthis is so like you to deny your own goodness: but mr
nightingale here saw him.‚Äù ‚Äúsaw whom, madam?‚Äù answered he. ‚Äúwhy, your
lawyer, sir,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúthat you so kindly sent to enquire into the
affair.‚Äù ‚Äúi am still in the dark, upon my honour,‚Äù said allworthy.
‚Äúwhy then do you tell him, my dear sir,‚Äù cries she. ‚Äúindeed, sir,‚Äù
 said nightingale, ‚Äúi did see that very lawyer who went from you when i
came into the room, at an alehouse in aldersgate, in company with two
of the fellows who were employed by lord fellamar to press mr jones,

and who were by that means present at the unhappy rencounter between
him and mr fitzpatrick.‚Äù ‚Äúi own, sir,‚Äù said mrs miller, ‚Äúwhen i saw
this gentleman come into the room to you, i told mr nightingale that i
apprehended you had sent him thither to inquire into the affair.‚Äù
 allworthy shewed marks of astonishment in his countenance at this
news, and was indeed for two or three minutes struck dumb by it. at
last, addressing himself to mr nightingale, he said, ‚Äúi must confess
myself, sir, more surprized at what you tell me than i have ever been
before at anything in my whole life. are you certain this was the
gentleman?‚Äù ‚Äúi am most certain,‚Äù answered nightingale. ‚Äúat
aldersgate?‚Äù cries allworthy. ‚Äúand was you in company with this lawyer
and the two fellows?‚Äù--‚Äúi was, sir,‚Äù said the other, ‚Äúvery near half
an hour.‚Äù ‚Äúwell, sir,‚Äù said allworthy, ‚Äúand in what manner did the
lawyer behave? did you hear all that past

 between him and the
fellows?‚Äù ‚Äúno, sir,‚Äù answered nightingale, ‚Äúthey had been together
before i came.--in my presence the lawyer said little; but, after i
had several times examined the fellows, who persisted in a story
directly contrary to what i had heard from mr jones, and which i find
by mr fitzpatrick was a rank falshood, the lawyer then desired the
fellows to say nothing but what was the truth, and seemed to speak so
much in favour of mr jones, that, when i saw the same person with you,
i concluded your goodness had prompted you to send him thithe

r.‚Äù--‚Äúand
did you not send him thither?‚Äù says mrs miller.--‚Äúindeed i did not,‚Äù
 answered allworthy; ‚Äúnor did i know he had gone on such an errand till
this moment.‚Äù--‚Äúi see it all!‚Äù said mrs miller, ‚Äúupon my soul, i see
it all! no wonder they have been closeted so close lately. son
nightingale, let me beg you run for these fellows immediately----find
them out if they are above-ground. i will go myself‚Äù--‚Äúdear madam,‚Äù
 said allworthy, ‚Äúbe patient, and do me the favour to send a servant
upstairs to call mr dowling hither, if he be in the house, or, if not,
mr blifil.‚Äù mrs miller went out muttering something to herself, and
presently returned with an answer, ‚Äúthat mr dowling was gone; but that
the t‚Äôother,‚Äù as she called him, ‚Äúwas coming.‚Äù

allworthy was of a cooler

iable
of human weaknesses. compassion for those who do not deserve it, i own
is a crime; and yet it is a crime from which you yourself are not
entirely free. i know i have been guilty of it in more than one
instance to this very person; and i will own i did send mr dowling,
not on a vain and fruitless enquiry, but to discover the witnesses,
and to endeavour to soften their evidence. this, sir, is the truth;
which, though i intended to conceal from you, i will not deny.‚Äù

‚Äúi confess,‚Äù said nightingale, ‚Äúthis is the light in which it appeared
to me from the gentleman‚Äôs behaviour.‚Äù

‚Äúnow, madam,‚Äù said allworthy, ‚Äúi believe you will once in your life
own you have entertained a wrong suspicion, and are not so angry with
my nephew as you was.‚Äù

mrs miller was silent; for, though she could not so hastily be pleased
with blifil, whom she looked upon to have been the ruin of jones, yet
in this particular instance he had imposed upon her as well as upon
the rest; so entirely had the dev

rly a servant, but i
live with him, an‚Äôt please your honour, at present. _non sum qualis
eram_, as your honour very well knows.‚Äù

mr allworthy then asked him many questions concerning jones, as to his
health, and other matters; to all which partridge answered, without
having the least regard to what was, but considered only what he would
have things appear; for a strict adherence to truth was not among the
articles of this honest fellow‚Äôs morality or his religion.

during this dialogue mr nightingale took his leave, and presently
after mrs miller left the room, when allworthy likewise despatched
blifil; for he imagined that partridge when alone with him would be
more explicit than before company. they were no sooner left in private
together than allworthy began, as in the following chapter.

him since his release from prison) than she came eagerly into the
room, and, advancing towards jones, wished him heartily joy of his
new-found uncle and his happy reconciliation; adding, ‚Äúi wish i could
give you joy on another account, my dear child; but anything so
inexorable i never saw.‚Äù

jones, with some appearance of surprize, asked her what she meant.
‚Äúwhy then,‚Äù says she, ‚Äúi have been with your young lady, and have
explained all matters to her, as they were told to me by my son
nightingale. she can have no longer any doubt about the letter; of
that i am certain; for i told her my son nightingale was ready to take
his oath, if she pleased, that it was all his own invention, and the
letter of his inditing. i told her the very reason of sending the
letter ought to recommend you to her the more, as it was all upon her
account, and a plain proof that you was resolved to quit all your
profligacy for the future; that you had never been guilty of a single
instance of infidelity to her si

ened earlier in our history, we would have entertained our
reader; but as we have now leisure only to attend to what is very
material, it shall suffice to say that matters being entirely adjusted
as to the afternoon visit mr western again returned home.



chapter xi.

the history draws nearer to a conclusion.


when mr western was departed, jones began to inform mr allworthy and
mrs miller that his liberty had been procured by two noble lords, who,
together with two surgeons and a friend of mr nightingale‚Äôs, had
attended the magistrate by whom he had been committed, and by whom, on
the surgeons‚Äô oaths, that the wounded person was out of all manner of
danger from his wound, he was discharged.

one only of these lords, he said, he had ever seen before, and that no
more than once; but the other had greatly surprized him by asking his
pardon for an offence he had been guilty of towards him, occasioned,
he said, entirely by his ignorance who he was.

now the reality of the case, with which jones

 to jones, she embraced him eagerly, crying, ‚Äúmy dearest
friend, i wish you joy a thousand and a thousand times of this blest
day.‚Äù and next mr allworthy himself received the same congratulations.
to which he answered, ‚Äúindeed, indeed, mrs miller, i am beyond
expression happy.‚Äù some few more raptures having passed on all sides,
mrs miller desired them both to walk down to dinner in the parlour,
where she said there were a very happy set of people assembled--being
indeed no other than mr nightingale and his bride, and his cousin
harriet with her bridegroom.

allworthy excused himself from dining with the company, saying he had
ordered some little thing for him and his nephew in his own apartment,
for that they had much private business to discourse of; but would not
resist promising the good woman that both he and jones would make part
of her society at supper.

mrs miller then asked what was to be done with blifil? ‚Äúfor indeed,‚Äù
 says she, ‚Äúi cannot be easy while such a villain is i

o! my sophia, am i never to hope for forgiveness?‚Äù--‚Äúi think, mr
jones,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúi may almost depend on your own justice, and leave
it to yourself to pass sentence on your own conduct.‚Äù--‚Äúalas! madam,‚Äù
 answered he, ‚Äúit is mercy, and not justice, which i implore at your
hands. justice i know must condemn me.--yet not for the letter i sent
to lady bellaston. of that i most solemnly declare you have had a true
account.‚Äù he then insisted much on the security given him by
nightingale of a fair pretence for breaking off, if, contrary to their
expectations, her ladyship should have accepted his offer; but confest
that he had been guilty of a great indiscretion to put such a letter
as that into her power, ‚Äúwhich,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúi have dearly paid for, in
the effect it has upon you.‚Äù ‚Äúi do not, i cannot,‚Äù says she, ‚Äúbelieve
otherwise of that letter than you would have me. my conduct, i think,
shews you clearly i do not believe there is much in that. and yet, mr

company.----‚Äúodzookers!‚Äù answered the squire, ‚Äúi will go with thee,
and so shall sophy! for i won‚Äôt part with thee to-night; and it would
be barbarous to part tom and the girl.‚Äù this offer was presently
embraced by allworthy, and sophia consented, having first obtained a
private promise from her father that he would not mention a syllable
concerning her marriage.



chapter the last.

in which the history is concluded.


young nightingale had been that afternoon, by appointment, to wait on
his father, who received him much more kindly than he expected. there
likewise he met his uncle, who was returned to town in quest of his
new-married daughter.

this marriage was the luckiest incident which could have happened to
the young gentleman; for these brothers lived in a constant state of
contention about the government of their children, both heartily
despising the method which each other took. each of them therefore now
endeavoured,

in this situation were affairs when mr allworthy and his company
arrived to complete the happiness of mrs miller, who no sooner saw
sophia than she guessed everything that had happened; and so great was
her friendship to jones, that it added not a few transports to those
she felt on the happiness of her own daughter.

there have not, i believe, been many instances of a number of people
met together, where every one was so perfectly happy as in this
company. amongst whom the father of young nightingale enjoyed the
least perfect content; for, notwithstanding his affection for his son,
notwithstanding the authority and the arguments of allworthy, together
with the other motive mentioned before, he could not so entirely be
satisfied with his son‚Äôs choice; and, perhaps, the presence of sophia
herself tended a little to aggravate and heighten his concern, as a
thought now and then suggested itself that his son might have had that
lady, or some other such. not that any of the charms which adorned

ent, to the great confusion of our poor blushing sophia, and the
great concern of jones upon her account. to say truth, there was not a
person present made wiser by this discovery; for mrs miller had
whispered it to her daughter, her daughter to her husband, her husband
to his sister, and she to all the rest.

sophia now took the first opportunity of withdrawing with the ladies,
and the squire sat in to his cups, in which he was, by degrees,
deserted by all the company except the uncle of young nightingale, who
loved his bottle as well as western himself. these two, therefore, sat
stoutly to it during the whole evening, and long after that happy hour
which had surrendered the charming sophia to the eager arms of her
enraptured jones.

thus, reader, we have at length brought our history to a conclusion,
in which, to our great pleasure, though contrary, perhaps, to thy
expectation, mr jones appears to be the happiest of all humankind; for
what happiness this world affords equal to the possession of

the income of her fortune, without running into debt. she maintains a
perfect intimacy with the lady of the irish peer; and in acts of
friendship to her repays all obligations she owes her husband.

mrs western was soon reconciled to her niece sophia, and hath spent
two months together with her in the country. lady bellaston made the
latter a formal visit at her return to town, where she behaved to
jones as a perfect stranger, and, with great civility, wished him joy
on his marriage.

mr nightingale hath purchased an estate for his son in the
neighbourhood of jones, where the young gentleman, his lady, mrs
miller, and her little daughter reside, and the most agreeable
intercourse subsists between the two families.

as to those of lower account, mrs waters returned into the country,
had a pension of ¬£60 a-year settled upon her by mr allworthy, and is
married to parson supple, on whom, at the instance of sophia, western
hath bestowed a considerable living.
