Winchester - 
      Head of the English church and nemesis of Gloucester. Winchester accuses Gloucester of wanting to be the sole advisor to Henry, to control him, and eventually to take over the kingdom from him. He grudgingly agrees to get along with Gloucester temporarily, but by the end of the play he purchases the title of cardinal, swearing that no one will have more power in the kingdom than he.
