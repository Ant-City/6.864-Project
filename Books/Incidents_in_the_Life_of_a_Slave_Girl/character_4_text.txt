        when i found that my master had actually begun to build the lonely cottage, other feelings mixed with those i have described. revenge, and calculations of interest, were added to flattered vanity and sincere gratitude for kindness. i knew nothing would enrage dr. flint so much as to know that i favored another; and it was something to triumph over my tyrant even in that small way. i thought he would revenge himself by selling me, and i was sure my friend, mr. sands, would buy me. he was a man of more generosity and feeling than my master, and i thought my freedom could be easily obtained from him. the crisis of my fate now came so near that i was desperate. i shuddered to think of being the mother of children that should be owned by my old tyrant. i knew that as soon as a new fancy took him, his victims were sold far off to get rid of them; especially if they had children. i had seen several women sold, with his babies at the breast. he never allowed his

 she listened in silence. i told her i would bear any thing and do any thing, if in time i had hopes of obtaining her forgiveness. i begged of her to pity me, for my dead mother's sake. and she did pity me. she did not say, "i forgive you;" but she looked at me lovingly, with her eyes full of tears. she laid her old hand gently on my head, and murmured, "poor child! poor child!"

the new tie to life.

        i returned to my good grandmother's house. she had an interview with mr. sands. when she asked him why he could not have left her one ewe lamb,—whether there were not plenty of slaves who did not care about character,—he made no answer; but he spoke kind and encouraging words. he promised to care for my child, and to buy me, be the conditions what they might.
        i had not seen dr. flint for five days. i had never seen him since i made the avowal to him. he talked of the disgrace i had brought on myself; how i had sinned against my master, and mortified my old gra

as long as he had me in his power he kept his word. on the fourth day after the birth of my babe, he entered my room suddenly, and commanded me to rise and bring my baby to him. the nurse who took care of me had gone out of the room to prepare some nourishment, and i was alone. there was no alternative. i rose, took up my babe, and crossed the room to where he sat. "now stand there," said he, "till i tell you to go back!" my child bore a strong resemblance to her father, and to the deceased mrs. sands, her grandmother. he noticed this; and while i stood before him, trembling with weakness, he heaped upon me and my little one every vile epithet he could think of. even the grandmother in her grave did not escape his curses. in the midst of his vituperations i fainted at his feet. this recalled him to his senses. he took the baby from my arms, laid it on the bed, dashed cold water on my face, took me up, and shook me violently, to restore my consciousness before any one entered the room. just t

        i replied, "sally, they are going to carry my children to the plantation to-morrow; and they will never sell them to any body so long as they have me in their power. now, would you advise me to go back?"

the children sold.

        the doctor came back from new york, of course without accomplishing his purpose. he had expended considerable money, and was rather disheartened. my brother and the children had now been in jail two months, and that also was some expense. my friends thought it was a favorable time to work on his discouraged feelings. mr. sands sent a speculator to offer him nine hundred dollars for my brother william, and eight hundred for the two children. these were high prices, as slaves were then selling; but the offer was rejected. if it had been merely a question of money, the doctor would have sold any boy of benny's age for two hundred dollars; but he could not bear to give up the power of revenge. but he was hard pressed for money, and he revolved the matter in his mind. he knew that if he could keep ellen till she was fifte

money was paid, the papers were signed, sealed, and delivered, and my brother and children were in the hands of the trader.

        it was a hurried transaction; and after it was over, the doctor's characteristic caution returned. he went back to the speculator, and said, "sir, i have come to lay you under obligations of a thousands dollars not to sell any of those negroes in this state." "you come too late," replied the trader; "our bargain is closed." he had, in fact, already sold them to mr. sands, but he did not mention it. the doctor required him to put irons on "that rascal, bill," and to pass through the back streets when he took his gang out of town. the trader was privately instructed to concede to his wishes. my good old aunt went to jail to bid the children good by, supposing them to be the speculator's property, and that she should never see them again. as she held benny in her lap, he said, "aunt nancy, i want to show you something." he led her to the door and showed her a long

        the doctor, more exasperated than ever, again tried to revenge himself on my relatives. he arrested uncle phillip on the charge of having aided my flight. he was carried before a court, and swore truly that he knew nothing of my intention to escape, and that he had not seen me since i left my master's plantation. the doctor then demanded that he should give bail for five hundred dollars that he would have nothing to do with me. several gentlemen offered to be security for him; but mr. sands told him he had better go back to jail, and he would see that he came out without giving bail.
        the news of his arrest was carried to my grandmother, who conveyed it to betty. in the kindness of her heart, she again stowed me away under the floor; and as she walked back and forth, in the performance of her culinary duties, she talked apparently to herself, but with the intention that i should hear what was going on. i hoped that my uncle's imprisonment would last but few days; still i wa

the candidate for congress.

        the summer had nearly ended, when dr. flint made a third visit to new york, in search of me. two candidates were running for congress, and he returned in season to vote. the father of my children was the whig candidate. the doctor had hitherto been a stanch whig; but now he exerted all his energies for the defeat of mr. sands. he invited large parties of men to dine in the shade of his trees, and supplied them with plenty of rum and brandy. if any poor fellow drowned his wits in the bowl, and, in the openness of his convivial heart, proclaimed that he did not mean to vote the democratic ticket, he was shoved into the street without ceremony.
        the doctor expended his liquor in vain. mr. sands was elected; an event which occasioned me some anxious thoughts. he had not emancipated my children and if he should di

important era in my brother's life.

        i missed the company and kind attentions of my brother william, who had gone to washington with his master, mr. sands. we received several letters from him, written without any allusion to me, but expressed in such a manner that i knew he did not forget me. i disguised my hand, and wrote to him in the same manner. it was a long session; and when it closed, william wrote to inform us that mr. sands was going to the north, to be gone some time, and that he was to accompany him. i knew that his master had promised to give him his freedom, but no time had been specified. would william trust to a slave's chances? i

 remembered how we used to talk together, in our young days, about obtaining our freedom, and i thought it very doubtful whether he would come back to us.
        grandmother received a letter from mr. sands saying that william had proved a most faithful servant, and he would also say a valued friend; that no mother had ever trained a better boy. he said he had travelled through the northern states and canada; and though the abolitionists had tried to decoy him away, they had never succeeded. he ended by saying they should be at home shortly.

        we expected letters from william, describing the novelties of his journey, but none came. in time, it was reported that mr. sands would return late i

 last the day arrived for the return of the travellers. grandmother had made loving preparations to welcome her absent boy back to the old hearthstone. when the dinner table was laid, william's plate occupied its old place. the stage coach went by empty. my grandmother waited dinner. she thought perhaps he was necessarily detained by his master. in my prison i listened anxiously, expecting every moment to hear my dear brother's voice and step. in the course of the afternoon a lad was sent by mr. sands to tell grandmother that william did not return with him; that the abolitionists had decoyed him away. but he begged her not to feel troubled about it, for he felt confident she would see william in a few days. as soon as he had time to reflect he would come back, for he could never expect to be so well off at the north as he had been with him.

named aggie. this poor creature had witnessed the sale of her children, and seen them carried off to parts unknown, without any hopes of ever hearing from them again. she saw that my grandmother had been weeping, and she said, in a sympathizing tone, "what's the matter, aunt marthy?"

        "o aggie," she replied, "it seems as if i shouldn't have any of my children or grandchildren left to hand me a drink when i'm dying, and lay my old body in the ground. my boy didn't come back with mr. sands. he staid at the north."

        poor old aggie clapped her hands for joy. "is dat what you's crying fur?" she exclaimed. "git down on your knees and bress de lord! i don't know whar my poor chillern is, and i nebber 'spect to know. you don't know whar poor linda's gone to; but you do know whar her brudder is. he's in free parts; and dat's de right place. don't murmur at de lord's doings, but git down on your knees and tank him for his goodness."

        it was not long before we received a letter from william. he wrote that mr. sands had always treated him kindly, and that he had tried to do his duty to him faithfully. but ever since he was a boy, he had longed to be free; and he had already gone through

enough to convince him he had better not lose the chance that offered. he concluded by saying, "don't worry about me, dear grandmother. i shall think of you always, and it will spur me on to work hard and try to do right. when i have earned money enough to give you a home, perhaps you will come to the north, and w

        mr. sands told my uncle phillip the particulars about william's leaving him. he said, "i trusted him as if he were my own brother, and treated him as kindly. the abolitionists talked to him in several places; but i had no idea they could tempt him. however, i don't blame william. he's young and inconsiderate, and those northern rascals decoyed him. i must confess the scamp was very bold about it. i met him coming down the steps of the astor house with his trunk on his shoulder, and i asked him where he w

        i afterwards heard an account of the affair from william himself. he had not been urged away by abolitionists. he needed no information they could give him about slavery to stimulate his desire for freedom. he looked at his hands, and remembered that they were once in irons. what security had he that they would not be so again? mr. sands was kind to him; but he might indefinitely postpone the promise he had made to give him his freedom. he might come under pecuniary embarrassments, and his property be seized by creditors; or he might die, without making any arrangements in his favor. he had too often known such accidents to happen to slaves who had kind masters, and he wisely resolved to make sure of the present opportunity to own himself. he was scrupulous about taking any money from his master on false pretences; so he sold h

        when dr. flint's family heard that william had deserted mr. sands, they chuckled greatly over the news. mrs. flint made her usual manifestations of christian feeling, by saying, "i'm glad of it. i hope he'll never get him again. i like to see people paid back in their own coin. i reckon linda's children will have to pay for it. i should be glad to see them in the speculator's hands again, for i'm tired of seeing those little niggers march about the streets."

informing mrs. sands who was the father of my children. she likewise proposed to tell her what an artful devil i was; that i had made a great deal of trouble in her family; that when mr. sands was at the north, she didn't doubt i had followed him in disguise, and persuaded william to run away. she had some reason to entertain such an idea; for i had written from the north, from time to time, and i dated my letters from various places. many of them fell into dr. flint's hands, as i expected they would; and he must have come to the conclusion that i travelled about a good deal. he kept a close watch over my children, thinking they would eventually lead to my detection.

d unexpected trial was in store for me. one day, when mr. sands and his wife were walking in the street, they met benny. the lady took a fancy to him and exclaimed, "what a pretty little negro! whom does he belong to?

        benny did not hear the answer; but he came home very indignant with the stranger lady, because she had called him a negro. a few days afterwards, mr. sands called on my grandmother, and told her he wanted her to take the children to his house. he said he had informed his wife of his relation to them, and told her they were motherless; and she wanted to see them.

page 208
        when he had gone, my grandmother came and asked what i would do. the question seemed a mockery. what could i do? they were mr. sands's slaves, and their mother was a slave, whom he had represented to be dead. perhaps he thought i was. i was too much pained and puzzled to

come to any decision; and the children were carried without my knowledge.

        mrs. sands had a sister from illinois staying with her. this lady, who had no children of her own, was so much pleased with ellen, that she offered to adopt her, and bring her up as she would a daughter. mrs. sands wanted to take benjamin. when grandmother reported this to me, i was tried almost beyond endurance. was this all i was to gain by what i had suffered for the sake of having my children free? true, the prospect seemed fair; but i knew too well how lightly slaveholders held such "parental relations." if pecuniary troubles should come, or if the new wife required more money than could conveniently be spared, my children might be thought of as a convenient means of raising funds. i had no trust in

thee, o slavery! never should i know peace till my children were emancipated with all due formalities of law.

        i was too proud to ask mr. sands to do any thing for my own benefit; but i could bring myself to become a supplicant for my children. i resolved to remind him of the promise he had made me, and to throw myself upon his honor for the performance of it. i persuaded my grandmother to go to him, and tell him i was not dead, and that i earnestly entreated him to keep the promise he had made me; that i had heard of the

. in my opinion, they had better be sent to the north. i don't think they are quite safe here. dr. flint boasts that they are still in his power. he says they were his daughter's property, and as she was not of age when they were sold, the contract is not legally binding."

        so, then, after all i had endured for their sakes, my poor children were between two fires; between my old master and their new master! and i was powerless. there was no protecting arm of the law for me to invoke. mr. sands proposed that ellen should go, for the present, to some of his relatives, who had removed to brooklyn, long island. it was promised that she should be well taken care of, and sent to school. i consented to it, as the best arrangement i could make for her. my grandmother, of course, negotiated it all; and mrs. sands knew of no other person in the transaction. she proposed that they should take ellen with them to washington and keep her till they had a good chance of sending her, with friends, to

s, ma'am;" and they little dreamed of the weighty secret that weighed down her young heart. she was an affectionate child, but naturally very reserved, except with those she loved, and i felt secure that my secret would be safe with her. i heard the gate close after her, with such feelings as only a slave mother can experience. during the day my meditations were very sad. sometimes i feared i had been very selfish not to give up all claim to her, and let her go to illinois, to be adopted by mrs. sands's sister. it was my experience of slavery that decided me against it. i feared that circumstances might arise that would cause her to be sent back. i felt confident that i should go to new york myself; and then i should be able to watch over her, and in some degree protect her.

        dr. flint's family knew nothing of the proposed arrangement till after ellen was gone, and the news

ressed her opinion very freely as to the respect mr. sands's showed for his wife, and for his own character, in acknowledging those "young niggers." and as for sending ellen away, she pronounced it to be just as much stealing as it would be for him to come and take a piece of furniture out of her parlor. she said her daughter was not of age to sign the bill of sale, and the children were her property; and when she became of age, or was married, she could take them, wherever she could lay hands on them.

        miss emily flint, the little girl to whom

 i had been bequeathed, was now in her sixteenth year. her mother considered it all right and honorable for her, or her future husband, to steal my children; but she did not understand how any body could hold up their heads in respectable society, after they had purchased their own children, as mr. sands had done. dr. flint said very little. perhaps he thought that benny would be less likely to be sent away if he kept quiet. one of my letters, that fell into his hands, was dated from canada; and he seldom spoke of me now. this state of things enabled me to slip down into the storeroom more frequently, where i could stand upright and move my limbs more freely.

        days, weeks, and months passed, and there came no news of ellen. i sent a letter to brooklyn, written in my grandmother's name, 
 
 ___________________________
 
 the end of six months, a letter came to my grandmother, from brooklyn. it was written by a young lady in the family, and announced that ellen had just arrived. it contained the following message from her: "i do try to do just as you told me to, and i pray for you every night and morning." i understood that these words were meant for me; and they were a balsam to my heart. the writer closed her letter by saying, "ellen is a nice girl, and we shall like to have to have her with us. my cousin, mr. sands, has given her to me, to be my little waiting maid. i shall send her to school, and i hope some day she will write to

page 216
you herself." this letter perplexed and troubled me. had my child's father merely placed her there till she was old enough to support herself? or had he given her to his cousin, as a piece of property? if the last idea was correct, his cousin might return to the south at any time, and hold ellen as a slave. i tried to put away from me the painful thought that such a fo

ar, i peeped at my children's faces, and heard their sweet voices, with a heart yearning all the while to say, "your mother is here." sometimes it appeared to me as if ages had rolled away since i entered upon that gloomy, monotonous existence. at times, i was stupefied and listless; at other times i became very impatient to know when these dark years would end, and i should again be allowed to feel the sunshine, and breathe the pure air.

        after ellen left us, this feeling increased. mr. sands had agreed that benny might go to the north

page 225
whenever his uncle phillip could go with him; and i was anxious to be there also, to watch over my children, and protect them so far as i was able. moreover, i was likely to be drowned out of my den, if i remained much longer; for the slight roof was getting badly out of repair, and uncle phillip was afraid to remove the shingles, lest some one should get a glimpse of me. when storms occurred in the night, they spread mats and bits of carpet

 to school. she had been there two years, and was now nine years old, and she scarcely knew her letters. there was no excuse for this, for there were good public schools in brooklyn, to which she could have been sent without expense.

        she staid with me till dark, and i went home with her. i was received in a friendly manner by the family, and all agreed in saying that ellen was a useful, good girl. mrs. hobbs looked me coolly in the face, and said, "i suppose you know that my cousin, mr. sands, has given her to my eldest daughter. she will make a nice waiting-maid for her when she grows up." i did not answer a word. how could she, who knew by experience the strength of a mother's love, and who was perfectly aware of the relation mr. sands bore to my children,—how could she look me in the face, while she thrust such a dagger into my heart?

        i was no longer surprised that they had kept her in such a state of ignorance. mr. hobbs had formerly

page 253
been wealthy, but he had

 failed, and afterwards obtained a subordinate situation in the custom house. perhaps they expected to return to the south some day; and ellen's knowledge was quite sufficient for a slave's condition. i was impatient to go to work and earn money, that i might change the uncertain position of my children. mr. sands had not kept his promise to emancipate them. i had also been deceived about ellen. what security had i with regard to benjamin? i felt that i had none.

        i returned to my friend's house in an uneasy state of mind. in order to protect my children, it was necessary that i should own myself. i called myself free, and sometimes felt so; but i knew i was insecure. i sat down that night and wrote a civil letter to dr. flint, asking him to state the lowest terms on which he would sell me; and a
 
 ___________________________
 
mportant business called me to boston, where my brother then was, and asked permission to bring a friend to supply my place as nurse, for a fortnight. i started on my journey immediately; and as soon as i arrived, i wrote to my grandmother that if benny came, he must be sent to boston. i knew she was only waiting for a good chance to send him north, and, fortunately, she had the legal power to do so, without asking leave of any body. she was a free woman; and when my children were purchased, mr. sands preferred to have the bill of sale drawn up in her name. it was conjectured that he advanced the money, but it was not known. at the south, a gentleman may have a shoal of colored children without any disgrace; but if he is known to purchase them, with the view of setting them free, the example is thought to be dangerous to their "peculiar institution," and he becomes unpopular.

        there was a good opportunity to send benny in a vessel coming directly to new york. he was put on board with
