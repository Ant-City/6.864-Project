full of trench-mortar fragments, old screws 
and bed-springs and things." 

she shook her head and smiled. 

"if you had any foreign bodies in your legs they 
would set up an inflammation and you'd have fever." 

"all right," i said. "we'll see what â‚¬omes out." 

she went out of the room and came back with the

old nurse of the early morning. together they made 
the bed with me in it. that was new to me and an 
admirable proceeding. 

"who is in charge here?" 

"miss van campen." 

"how many nurses are there?" 

"just us two." 

"won't there be more?" 

"some more are coming." 

"when will they get here?" 

"i don't know. you ask a great many questions for 
a sick boy." 

"i'm not sick," i said, "i'm wounded." 

they had finished making the bed and i lay with a 
clean smooth sheet under me and another sheet over 
me. mrs. walker went out and came back with a 
pajama jacket. they put that on me and i felt very 
clean and dressed. 

"you're awfully nice to me," i said.

they helped me and held me up but it was not any 
use. afterward i lay and looked out the open doors 
onto the balcony. 

"when does the doctor come?" 

"when he gets back. we've tried to telephone to 
lake como for him." 

"aren't there any other doctors?" 

"he's the doctor for the hospital." 

miss gage brought a pitcher of water and a glass. i 
drank three glasses and then they left me and i looked 
out the window a while and went back to sleep. i ate 
some lunch and in the afternoon miss van campen, 
the superintendent, came up to see me. she did not 
like me and i did not like her. she was small and 
neatly suspicious and too good for her position. she 
asked many questions and seemed to think it was some- 
what disgraceful that i was with the italians. 

"can i have wine with the meals?" i asked her. 

"only if the doctor prescribes it." 

"i can't have it until he comes?" 

"absolutely not." 

"you plan on having him come eventually?" 

"we've telephoned him at lake como." 

she went o

"why were you rude to miss van campen?" she 
asked after she had done something for me very skil- 
fully. 

"i didn't mean to be. but she was snooty." 

"she said you were domineering and rude." 

"i wasn't. but what's the idea of a hospital with- 
out a doctor?" 

"he's coming. they've telephoned for him to lake 
como."

"what does he do there? swim?" 
"no. he has a clinic there." 
"why don't they get another doctor?"

f cinzano and held it 
straight up on my stomach, the cool glass against my 
stomach, and took little drinks making rings on my 
stomach from holding the bottle there between drinks, 
and watched it get dark outside over the roofs of the 
town. the swallows circled around and i watched them 
and the night-hawks flying above the roofs and drank 
the cinzano. miss gage brought up a glass with some 
egg-nog in it. i lowered the vermouth bottle to the 
other side of the bed when she came in. 

"miss van campen had some sherry put in this," 
she said. "you shouldn't be rude to her. she's not 
young and this hospital is a big responsibility for her. 
mrs. walker's too old and she's no use to her." 

"she's a splendid woman," i said. "thank her very 
much." 

"i'm going to bring your supper right away." 
"that's all right," i said. "i'm not hungry." 
when she brought the tray and put it on the bed 
table i thanked her and ate a little of the supper. after-

anti-aircraft gun on the next roof talking. it was cool 
and they were putting on their capes. i worried in 
the night about some one coming up but catherine said 
they were all asleep. once in the night we went to 
sleep and when i woke she was not there but i heard 
her coming along the hall and the door opened and she 
came back to the bed and said it was all right she had 
been downstairs and they were all asleep. she had 
been outside miss van campen's door and heard her 
breathing in her sleep. she brought crackers and we 
ate them and drank some vermouth. we were very 
hungry but she said that would all have to be gotten 
out of me in the morning. i went to sleep again in the 
morning when it was light and when i was awake i 
found she was gone again. she came in looking fresh 
and lovely and sat on the bed and the sun rose while i 
had the thermometer in my mouth and we smelled the

"a bump like that could make you crazy. it never 
bothers you?" 

"no." 

"you're a lucky young man. have you the letter 
done? i'm going down." 

"it's here," i said. 

"you ought to ask her not to do night duty for a 
while. she's getting very tired." 

"all right. i will." 

"i want to do it but she won't let me. the others 
are glad to let her have it. you might give her just a 
little rest." 

"all right." 

"miss van campen spoke about you sleeping all the 
forenoons." 

"she would." 

"it would be better if you let her stay off nights a 
little while." 

"i want her to." 

"you do not. but if you would make her i'd re- 
spect you for it." 

"i'll make her." 

"i don't believe it." she took the note and went out. 
i rang the bell and in a little while miss gage came in. 

"what's the matter?" 

"i just wanted to talk to you. don't you think miss 
barkley ought to go off night duty for a while? she

looks awfully tired. why does she stay on so long?" 

miss gage looked at me. 

"i'm a friend of yours," she said. "you don't have 
to talk to me like that." 

"what do you mean?" 

"don't be silly. was that all you wanted?" 

"do you want a vermouth?" 

"all right. then i have to go." she got out the 
bottle from the armoire and brought a glass. 

"you take the glass," i said. 'til drink out of the 
bottle." 

"here's to you," said miss gage. 

"what did van campen say about me sleeping late 
in the mornings?" 

"she just jawed about it. she calls you our priv- 
ileged patient." 

"to hell with her." 

"she isn't mean," miss gage said. "she's just old 
and cranky. she never liked you." 

"no." 

"well, i do. and i'm your friend. don't forget 
that." 

"you're awfully damned nice." 

"no. i know who you think is nice. but i'm your 
friend. how does your leg feel?"

anotherapy treatments. sometimes i stopped in at 
the anglo-american club and sat in a deep leather- 
cushioned chair in front of the window and read the 
magazines. they would not let us go out together 
when i was off crutches because it was unseemly for 
a nurse to be seen unchaperoned with a patient who did 
not look as though he needed attendance, so we were 
not together much in the afternoons. although some- 
times we could go out to dinner if ferguson went 
along. miss van campen had accepted the status that 
we were great friends because she got a great amount 
of work out of catherine. she thought catherine 
came from very good people and that prejudiced her 
in her favor finally. miss van campen admired fam-

more. they were mostly vermouth bottles, marsala bot- 
tles, capri bottles, empty chianti flasks and a few cognac 
bottles. the porter had carried out the large bottles, 
those that had held vermouth, and the straw-covered 
chianti flasks, and left the brandy bottles for the last. 
it was the brandy bottles and a bottle shaped like a bear, 
which had held kummel, that miss van campen found. 
the bear-shaped bottle enraged her particularly. she 
held it up, the bear was sitting up on his haunches with 
his paw r s up, there was a cork in his glass head and a 
few sticky crystals at the bottom. i laughed. 

"it was kummel," i said. "the best kummel comes 
in those bear-shaped bottles. it comes from russia." 

"those are all brandy bottles, aren't they?" miss 
van campen asked. 

"i can't see them all," i said. "but they probably 
are. 

"how long has this been going on?"

dice with alcoholism." 

"with what?" 

"with alcoholism. you heard me say it." i did 
not say anything. "unless you find something else i'm 
afraid you will have to go back to the front when 
you are through with your jaundice. i don't believe 
self-inflicted jaundice entitles you to a convalescent 
leave." 

"you don't?" 

"i do not." 

"have you ever had jaundice, miss van campen?" 

"no, but i have seen a great deal of it." 

"you noticed how the patients enjoyed it?" 

"i suppose it is better than the front." 

"miss van campen," i said, "did you ever know a 
man who tried to disable himself by kicking himself 
in the scrotum?" 

miss van campen ignored the actual question. she 
had to ignore it or leave the room. she was not ready 
to leave because she had disliked me for a long time 
and she was now cashing in. 

"i have known many men to escape the front through

"that wasn't the question. i have seen self-inflicted 
wounds also. i asked you if you had ever known a 
man who had tried to disable himself by kicking him- 
self in the scrotum. because that is the nearest sensa- 
tion to jaundice and it is a sensation that i believe few 
women have ever experienced. that was why i asked 
you if you had ever had the jaundice, miss van 
campen, because â€” " miss van campen left the room. 
later miss gage came in.

"what did you say to van campen ? she was furi- 
ous." 

"we were comparing sensations. i was going to 
suggest that she had never experienced childbirth " 

"you're a fool/' gage said. "she's after your scalp." 

"she has my scalp," i said. "she's lost me my leave 
and she might try and get me court-martialled. she's 
mean enough." 

"she never liked you," gage said. "what's it 
about?"

not to go back to the front." 

"pooh," said gage. "i'll swear you've never taken 
a drink. everybody will swear you've never taken a

"she found the bottles." 

"i've told you a hundred times to clear out those 
bottles. where are they now?" 

"in the armoire." 

"have you a suitcase?" 

"no. put them in that rucksack." 

miss gage packed the bottles in the rucksack. "i'll 
give them to the porter," she said. she started for the 
door. 

"just a minute," miss van campen said. "i'll take 
those bottles." she had the porter with her. "carry 
them, please," she said. "i want to show them to the 
doctor when i make my report." 

she went down the hall. the porter carried the sack. 
he knew what was in it. 

nothing happened except that i lost my leave.
