you since berlin!

mrs. cheveley.  not since berlin, vicomte.  five years ago!

vicomte de nanjac.  and you are younger and more beautiful than ever.
how do you manage it?

mrs. cheveley.  by making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming
people like yourself.

vicomte de nanjac.  ah! you flatter me.  you butter me, as they say here.

mrs. cheveley.  do they say that here?  how dreadful of them!

vicomte de nanjac.  yes, they have a wonderful language.  it should be
more widely known.

younger_.  _clean-shaven_, _with finely-cut features_, _dark-haired and
dark-eyed_.  _a personality of mark_.  _not popular—few personalities

many_.  _the note of his manner is that of perfect distinction_, _with a
slight touch of pride_.  _one feels that he is conscious of the success
he has made in life_.  _a nervous temperament_, _with a tired look_.

of an almost complete separation of passion and intellect_, _as though
thought and emotion were each isolated in its own sphere through some
violence of will-power_.  _there is nervousness in the nostrils_, _and in
the pale_, _thin_, _pointed hands_.  _it would be inaccurate to call him
picturesque_.  _picturesqueness cannot survive the house of commons_.
_but vandyck would have liked to have painted his head_.]

sir robert chiltern.  good evening, lady markby!  i hope you have brought
sir john with you?

lady markby.  oh! i have brought a much more charming person than sir
john.  sir john’s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has
become quite unbearable.  really, now that the house of commons is trying
to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.

sir robert chiltern.  i hope not, lady markby.  at any rate we do our
best to waste the public time, don’t we?  but who is this charming person
you have been

kind enough to bring to us?

lady markby.  her name is mrs. cheveley!  one of the dorsetshire
cheveleys, i suppose.  but i really don’t know.  families are so mixed
nowadays.  indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else.

sir robert chiltern.  mrs. cheveley?  i seem to know the name.

lady markby.  she has just arrived from vienna.

sir robert chiltern.  ah! yes.  i think i know whom you mean.

lady markby.  oh! she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant
scandals about all her friends.  i really must go to vienna next winter.
i hope there is a good chef at the embassy.

sir robert chiltern.  if there is not, the ambassador will certainly have
to be recalled.  pray point out mrs. cheveley to me.  i should like to
see her.

lady markby.  let me introduce you.  [_to_ mrs. cheveley.]  my dear, sir
robert chiltern is dying to know you!

robert chiltern.  [_bowing_.]  every one is dying to know the
brilliant mrs. cheveley.  our attachés at vienna write to us about
nothing else.

mrs. cheveley.  thank you, sir robert.  an acquaintance that begins with
a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.  it starts in the
right manner.  and i find that i know lady chiltern already.

sir robert chiltern.  really?

mrs. cheveley.  yes.  she has just reminded me that we were at school
together.  i remember it perfectly now.  she always got the good conduct
prize.  i have a distinct recollection of lady chiltern always getting
the good conduct prize!

sir robert chiltern.  [_smiling_.]  and what prizes did you get, mrs.
cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  my prizes came a little later on in life.  i don’t think
any of them were for good conduct.  i forget!

sir robert chiltern.  i am sure they were for

something charming!

mrs. cheveley.  i don’t know that women are always rewarded for being
charming.  i think they are usually punished for it!  certainly, more
women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers than
through anything else!  at least that is the only way i can account for
the terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in london!

sir robert chiltern.  what an appalling philosophy that sounds!  to
attempt to classify you, mrs. cheveley, would be an impertinence.  but
may i ask, at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist?  those seem to
be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.

mrs. cheveley.  oh, i’m neither.  optimism begins in a broad grin, and
pessimism ends with blue spectacles.  besides, they are both of them
merely poses.

sir robert chiltern.  you prefer to be natural?

mrs. cheveley.  sometimes.  but it is such
 
 ___________________________
 
 a very difficult pose to keep
up.

sir robert chiltern.  what would those modern psychological novelists, of
whom we hear so much, say to such a theory as that?

mrs. cheveley.  ah! the strength of women comes from the fact that
psychology cannot explain us.  men can be analysed, women . . . merely
adored.

sir robert chiltern.  you think science cannot grapple with the problem
of women?

mrs. cheveley.  science can never grapple with the irrational.  that is
why it has no future before it, in this world.

sir robert chiltern.  and women represent the irrational.

mrs. cheveley.  well-dressed women do.

sir robert chiltern.  [_with a polite bow_.]  i fear i could hardly agree
with you there.  but do sit down.  and now tell me, what makes you leave
your brilliant vienna for our gloomy london—or perhaps the question

is
indiscreet?

mrs. cheveley.  questions are never indiscreet.  answers sometimes are.

sir robert chiltern.  well, at any rate, may i know if it is politics or
pleasure?

mrs. cheveley.  politics are my only pleasure.  you see nowadays it is
not fashionable to flirt till one is forty, or to be romantic till one is
forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have
nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy.  and philanthropy seems
to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their
fellow-creatures.  i prefer politics.  i think they are more . . .

sir robert chiltern.  a political life is a noble career!

mrs. cheveley.  sometimes.  and sometimes it is a clever game, sir
robert.  and sometimes it is a great nuisance.

sir robert chiltern.  which do you find it?

mrs. cheveley.  i?  a combination of all three.  [_drops her fan_.]

sir robert chiltern.  [_picks up fan_.]  allow me!

mrs. cheveley.  thanks.

sir robert chiltern.  but you have not told me yet what makes you honour
london so suddenly.  our season is almost over.

mrs. cheveley.  oh! i don’t care about the london season!  it is too
matrimonial.  people are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from
them.  i wanted to meet you.  it is quite true.  you know what a woman’s
curiosity is.  almost as great as a man’s!  i wanted immensely to meet
you, and . . . to ask you to do something for me.

sir robert chiltern.  i hope it is not a little thing, mrs

mrs. cheveley.  [_after a moment’s reflection_.]  no, i don’t think it is
quite a little thing.

sir robert chiltern.  i am so glad.  do tell me what it is.

mrs. cheveley.  later on.  [_rises_.]  and now may i walk through your
beautiful house?  i hear your pictures are charming.  poor baron
arnheim—you remember the baron?—used to tell me you had some wonderful
corots.

sir robert chiltern.  [_with an almost imperceptible start_.]  did you
know baron arnheim well?

mrs. cheveley.  [_smiling_.]  intimately.  did you?

sir robert chiltern.  at one time.

mrs. cheveley.  wonderful man, wasn’t he?

sir robert chiltern.  [_after a pause_.]  he was very remarkable, in many
ways.

mrs. cheveley.  i often think it such a pity he never wrote his memoirs.
they would have been most interesting.

sir robert chiltern.  yes: he knew men and cities well, like the old
greek.

mrs. cheveley.  oh, no!  i can’t stand your english house-parties.  in
england people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast.  that is so
dreadful of them!  only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.  and then
the family skeleton is always reading family prayers.  my stay in england

mrs. cheveley.  quite seriously.  i want to talk to you about a great
political and financial scheme, about this argentine canal company, in
fact.

sir robert chiltern.  what a tedious, practical subject for you to talk
about, mrs. cheveley!

mrs. cheveley.  oh, i like tedious, practical subjects.  what i don’t
like are tedious, practical people.  there is a wide difference.
besides, you are interested, i know, in international canal schemes.  you
were lord radley’s secretary, weren’t you, when the government bought the
suez canal shares?

sir robert chiltern.  yes.  but the suez canal was a very great and
splendid undertaking.  it gave us our direct ro

argentine scheme is a commonplace stock exchange swindle.

mrs. cheveley.  a speculation, sir robert!  a brilliant, daring
speculation.

sir robert chiltern.  believe me, mrs. cheveley, it is a swindle.  let us
call things by their proper names.  it makes matters simpler.  we have
all the information about it at the foreign office.  in fact, i sent out
a special commission to inquire into the matter privately, and they
report that the works are hardly begun, and as for the money already
subscribed, no one seems to know what has become of it.  the whole thing
is a second panama, and with not a quarter of the chance of success that

mrs. cheveley.  i have invested very largely in it.

thing?

mrs. cheveley.  your old friend—and mine.

sir robert chiltern.  who?

mrs. cheveley.  baron arnheim.

sir robert chiltern.  [_frowning_.]  ah! yes.  i remember hearing, at the
time of his death, that he had been mixed up in the whole affair.

mrs. cheveley.  it was his last romance.  his last but one, to do him
justice.

[_motions to him with her fan to sit down again beside her_.]

sir robert chiltern.  i fear i have no advice to give you, mrs. cheveley,
except to interest yourself in something less dangerous.  the success of
the canal depends, of course, on the attitude of england, and i am going
to lay the report of the commissioners before the house to-morrow night.

mrs. cheveley.  that you must not do.  in your own interests, sir robert,
to say nothing of mine, you must not do that.

sir robert chiltern.  [_looking at her in wonder_.]  in my own interests?
my dear mrs. cheveley, what do you mean?  [_sits down beside her_.]

mrs. cheveley.  sir robert, i will be quite frank with you.  i want you
to withdraw the report that you had intended to lay before the house, on
the ground that you have reasons to believe that the commissioners have
been prejudiced or misinformed, or something.  then i want you to say a
few words to the effect that the government is going to reconsider the
question, and th

at you have reason to believe that the canal, if
completed, will be of great international value.  you know the sort of
things ministers say in cases of this kind.  a few ordinary platitudes
will do.  in modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good
platitude.  it makes the whole world kin.  will you do that for me?

sir robert chiltern.  mrs. cheveley, you cannot be serious in making me
such a proposition!

mrs. cheveley.  i am quite serious.

sir robert chiltern.  [_coldly_.]  pray allow me to believe that you are
not.

mrs. cheveley.  [_speaking with great deliberation and emphasis_.]  ah!
but i am.  and if you do what i ask you, i . . . will pay you very
handsomely!

sir robert chiltern.  pay me!

mrs. cheveley.  yes.

sir robert chiltern.  i am afraid i don’t quite understand what you mean.

mrs. cheveley.  [_leaning back on the sofa and looking at him_.]  how
very disappointing!  and i have come all the way from vienna in order
that you should th

sir robert chiltern.  i fear i don’t.

mrs. cheveley.  [_in her most nonchalant manner_.]  my dear sir robert,
you are a man of the world, and you have your price, i suppose.
everybody has nowadays.  the drawback is that most people are so
dreadfully expensive.  i know i am.  i hope you will be more reasonable
in your terms.

sir robert chiltern.  [_rises indignantly_.]  if you will allow me, i
will call your carriage for you.  you have lived so long abroad, mrs.
cheveley, that you seem to be unable to realise that you are talking to
an english gentleman.

mrs. cheveley.  [_detains him by touching his arm with her fan_, _and
keeping it there while she is talking_.]  i realise that i am talking to
a man who laid the foundation of his fortune by selling to a stock
exchange speculator a cabinet secret.

sir robert chiltern.  [_biting his

lip_.]  what do you mean?

mrs. cheveley.  [_rising and facing him_.]  i mean that i know the real
origin of your wealth and your career, and i have got your letter, too.

sir robert chiltern.  what letter?

mrs. cheveley.  [_contemptuously_.]  the letter you wrote to baron
arnheim, when you were lord radley’s secretary, telling the baron to buy
suez canal shares—a letter written three days before the government
announced its own purchase.

sir robert chiltern.  [_hoarsely_.]  it is not true.

mrs. cheveley.  you thought that letter had been destroyed.  how foolish
of you!  it is in my possession.

sir robert chiltern.  the affair to which you allude was no more than a
speculation.  the house of commons had not yet passed the bill; it might
have been rejected.

mrs. cheveley.  it was a swindle, sir robert.  let us call things by
their proper names.  it makes everything simpler.  and now i am going to
sell you that letter, and the price i ask for it i

it, sir robert, sooner or later!

sir robert chiltern.  i cannot do what you ask me.

mrs. cheveley.  you mean you cannot help doing it.  you know you are
standing on the edge of a precipice.  and it is not for you to make
terms.  it is for you to accept them.  supposing you refuse—

sir robert chiltern.  what then?

mrs. cheveley.  my dear sir robert, what then?  you are ruined, that is
all!  remember to what a point your puritanism in england has brought
you.  in old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than his
neighbours.  in fact, to be

and now you have got to pay for it.  sooner or later we have all to pay
for what we do.  you have to pay now.  before i leave you to-night, you
have got to promise me to suppress your report, and to speak in the house
in favour of this scheme.

sir robert chiltern.  what you ask is impossible.

mrs. cheveley.  you must make it possible.  you are going to make it
possible.  sir robert, you know what your english newspapers are like.
suppose that when i leave this house i drive down to some newspaper
office, and give them this scandal and the proofs of it!  think of their
loathsome joy, of the delight they would have in dragging you down, of
the mud and mire they would plunge you in.  think of the hypocrite with
his greasy smile penning his leading article

money you want.

had heaps of opportunity—you have made an announcement to the house in

that . . . amongst other things.

tedious journey from vienna now.  it has been a great success.  but, of
course, for the next twenty-four hours the whole thing is a dead secret.

mrs. cheveley.  [_with a flash of amusement in her eyes_.]  between your
husband and myself.

mrs. cheveley.  oh, don’t be so solemn about it, or i shall be obliged to

dishonest, an evil influence on every one whose trust or friendship she
could win.  i hated, i despised her.  she stole things, she was a thief.
she was sent away for being a thief.  why do you let her influence you?

sir robert chiltern.  gertrude, what you tell me may be true, but it
happened many years ago.  it is best forgotten!  mrs. cheveley may have
changed since then.  no one should be entirely judged by their past.

lady chiltern.  [_sadly_.]  one’s past is what one is.  it is the only
way by which people should be judged.

sir robert chiltern.  that is a hard saying, gertrude!

lady chiltern.  it is a true saying, robert.  and what did she mean by
boasting that she had got you to lend your support, your name, to a t

i have heard you describe as the most dishonest and fraudulent scheme
there has ever been in political life?

sir robert chiltern.  [_biting his lip_.]  i was mistaken in the view i
took.  we all may make mistakes.

lady chiltern.  but you told me yesterday that you had received the
report from the commission, and that it entirely condemned the whole
thing.

sir robert chiltern.  [_walking up and down_.]  i have reasons now to
believe that the commission was prejudiced, or, at any rate, misinformed.
besides, gertrude, public and private life are different things.  they
have different laws, and move on different lines.

lady chiltern.  they should both represent man at his highest.  i see no
difference between them.

sir robert chiltern.  [_stopping_.]  in the present case, on a matter of
practical politics, i have changed my mind.  that is all.

lady chiltern.  all!

sir robert chiltern.  [_sternly_.]  yes!

lady chiltern.  robert!  oh! it is horrible that i should have to ask you
such a question—robert, are you telling me the whole truth?

sir robert chiltern.  why do you ask me such a question?

lady chiltern.  [_after a pause_.]  why do you not answer it?

sir robert chiltern.  [_sitting down_.]  gertrude, truth is a very
complex thing, and politics is a very complex business.  there are wheels
within wheels.  one may be under certain obligations to people that one
must pay.  sooner or later in political life one has to compromise.
every one does.

lady chiltern.  compromise?  robert, why do you talk so differently
to-night from the way i have always heard you talk?  why are you changed?

sir robert chiltern.  i am not changed.  but circumstances alter things.

sir robert chiltern.  that it was necessary, vitally necessary?

lady chiltern.  it can never be necessary to do what is not honourable.
or if it be necessary, then what is it that i have loved!  but it is not,
robert; tell me it is not.  why should it be?  what gain would you get?
money?  we have no need of that!  and money that comes from a tainted
source is a degradation.  power?  but power is nothing in itself.  it is
power to do good that is fine—that, and that only.  what is it, then?

that.

lady chiltern.  robert, that is all very well for other men, for men who
treat life simply as a sordid speculation; but not for you, robert, not
for you.  you are different.  all your life you have stood apart from
others.  you have never let the world soil you.  to the world, as to
myself, you have been an ideal always.  oh! be that ideal still.  that

lady chiltern.  i know that there are men with horrible secrets in their
lives—men who have done some shameful thing, and who in some critical
moment have to pay for it, by doing some other act of shame—oh! don’t

secret dishonour or disgrace?  tell me, tell me at once, that—

sir robert chiltern.  gertrude, there is nothing in my past life that you
might not know.

you say those dreadful things, things so unlike your real self?  don’t
let us ever talk about the subject again.  you will write, won’t you, to
mrs. cheveley, and tell her that you cannot support this scandalous
scheme of hers?  if you have given her any promise you must take it back,
that is all!

lady chiltern.  surely, robert!  what else is there to do?

sir robert chiltern.  i might see her personally.  it would be better.

lady chiltern.  you must never see her again, robert.  she is not a woman
you should ever speak to.  she is not worthy to talk to a man like you.
no; you must write to her at once, now, this moment, and let your letter
show her that your decision is quite irrevocable!

sir robert chiltern.  write this moment!

lady chiltern.  yes.

sir robert chiltern.  but it is so late.  it is close on twelve.

lady chiltern.  that makes no matter.  she must know at once that she has
been mistaken in you—and that you are not a man to do anything base or
underhand or dishonourable.  write here, robert.  write that you decline
to support this scheme of hers, as you hold it to be a dishonest scheme.

to-night that i have saved you from something that might have been a
danger to you, from something that might have made men honour you less

have brought into the political life of our time a nobler atmosphere, a
finer attitude towards life, a freer air of purer aims and higher
ideals—i know it, and for that i love you, robert.

sir robert chiltern.  oh, love me always, gertrude, love me always!

of love.  we needs must love the highest when we see it!  [_kisses him

_as the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]

lord goring.  my dear robert, it’s a very awkward business, very awkward
indeed.  you should have told your wife the whole thing.  secrets from
other people’s wives are a necessary luxury in modern life.  so, at
least, i am always told at the club by people who are bald enough to know
better.  but no man should ha

invariably finds it out.  women have a wonderful instinct about things.
they can discover everything except the obvious.

sir robert chiltern.  arthur, i couldn’t tell my wife.  when could i have
told her?  not last night.  it would have made a life-long separation
between us, and i would have lost the love of the one woman in the world
i worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me.  last
night it would have been quite impossible.  she would have turned from me
in horror . . . in horror and in contempt.

lord goring.  is lady chiltern as perfect as all that?

sir robert chiltern.  yes; my wife is as perfect as al

lord goring.  [_taking off his left-hand glove_.]  what a pity!  i beg
your pardon, my dear fellow, i didn’t quite mean that.  but if what you
tell me is true, i should like to have a serious talk about life with
lady chiltern.

sir robert chiltern.  it would be quite useless.

lord goring.  may i try?

sir robert chiltern.  yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.

lord goring.  well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
experiment.

sir robert chiltern.  all such experiments are terribly dangerous.

lord goring.  everything is dangerous, my dear fellow.  if it wasn’t so,
life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . well, i am bound to say that i think
you should have told her years ago.

sir robert chiltern.  when?  when we were engaged?  do you think she
would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that i had done
a thing that i suppose most men would call shamef

lord goring.  [_slowly_.]  yes; most men would call it ugly names.  there
is no doubt of that.

sir robert chiltern.  [_bitterly_.]  men who every day do something of
the same kind themselves.  men who, each one of them, have worse secrets
in their own lives.

lord goring.  that is the reason they are so pleased to find out other
people’s secrets.  it distracts public attention from their own.

sir robert chiltern.  and, after all, whom did i wrong by what i did?  no
one.

lord goring.  [_looking at him steadily_.]  except yourself, robert.

sir robert chiltern.  [_after a pause_.]  of course i had private
information about a certain transaction contemplated by the government of
the day, and i acted on it.  private information is practically the
source of every large modern fortune.

invariably the result.

unforgiveable things nowadays.  is it fair that the folly, the sin of
one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like
mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that i have
worked for, all that i have built up.  is it fair, arthur?

lord goring.  life is never fair, robert.  and perhaps it is a good thing
for most of us that it is not.

sir robert chiltern.  every man of ambition has to fight his century with
its own weapons.  what this century worships is wealth.  the god of this
century is wealth.  to succeed one must have wealth.  at all costs one
must have wealth.

lord goring.  you underrate yourself, robert.  believe me, without wealth
you could have succeeded just as well.

sir robert chiltern.  and if it is all taken away from me now?  if i lose
everything over a horrible scandal?  if i am hounded from public life?

lord goring.  robert, how could you have sold yourself for money?

sir robert chiltern.  [_excitedly_.]  i did not sell myself for money.  i
bought success at a great price.  that is all.

lord goring.  [_gravely_.]  yes; you certainly paid a great price for it.
but what first made you think of doing such a thing?

sir robert chiltern.  baron arnheim.

lord goring.  damn

sir robert chiltern.  no; he was a man of a most subtle and refined
intellect.  a man of culture, charm, and distinction.  one of the most
intellectual men i ever met.

lord goring.  ah! i prefer a gentlemanly fool any day.  there is more to
be said for stupidity than people imagine.  personally i have a great
admiration for stupidity.  it is a sort of fellow-feeling, i suppose.
but how did he do it?  tell me the whole thing.

sir robert chiltern.  [_throws himself into an armchair by the
writing-table_.]  one night after dinner at lord radley’s the baron began
talking about success in modern life as something that one could reduce
to an absolutely definite science.  with that wonderfully fascinating
quiet voice of his he expounded to us the most terrible of all
philosophies, the philosophy of power, preached to us the most marvellous
of all gospels, the gospel of gold.  i think he saw the effect he had
produced on me, for some days a

, his enamels, his jewels, his carved ivories, made me
wonder at the strange loveliness of the luxury in which he lived; and
then told me that luxury was nothing but a background, a painted scene in
a play, and that power, power over other men, power over the world, was
the one thing worth having, the one supreme pleasure worth knowing, the
one joy one never tired of, and that in our century only the rich
possessed it.

lord goring.  [_with great deliberation_.]  a thoroughly shallow creed.

sir robert chiltern.  [_rising_.]  i didn’t think so then.  i don’t think
so now.  wealth has given me enormous power.  it gave me at the very
outset of my life freedom, and freedom is everything.  you have never
been poor, and never known what ambition is.  you cannot understand what
a wonderful chance the baron gave me.  such a chance as few men get.

lord goring.  fortunately for them, if one is to judge by results.  but
tell me definitely, how did the baron finally persuade you to—well, to do

sir robert chiltern.  when i was going away he said to me that if i ever
could give him any private information of real value he would make me a
very rich man.  i was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my
ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless.  six weeks
later certain private documents passed through my hands.

lord goring.  [_keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the carpet_.]  state
documents?

sir robert chiltern.  yes.  [lord goring _sighs_, _then passes his hand
across his forehead and looks up_.]

lord goring.  i had no idea that you, of all men in the world, could have
been so weak, robert, as to yield to such a temptation as baron arnheim
held out to you.

sir robert chiltern.  weak?  oh, i am sick of hearing that phrase.  sick
of using it about others.  weak?  do you really think, arthur, that it is
weakness that yields to temptation?  i tell you that there are terrible
temptations that it require

to stake all one’s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one
throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, i care not—there is no
weakness in that.  there is a horrible, a terrible courage.  i had that
courage.  i sat down the same afternoon and wrote baron arnheim the
letter this woman now holds.  he made three-quarters of a million over
the transaction.

lord goring.  and you?

sir robert chiltern.  i received from the baron £110,000.

lord goring.  you were worth more, robert.

sir robert chiltern.  no; that money gave me exactly what i wanted, power
over others.  i went into the house immediately.  the baron advised me in
finance from time to time.  before five years i had almost trebled my
fortune.  since then everything that i have touched has turned out a
success.  in all things connected with money i have had a luck so
extraordinary that sometimes it has made me almost afraid.  i

own weapons, and won.

man who can’t talk morality twice a week to a large, popular, immoral

night, and not quite enough clothes.  that is always a sign of despair in

sir robert chiltern.  go!  go at once.  you have done your worst now.

mrs. cheveley.  my worst?  i have not yet finished with you, with either
of you.  i give you both till to-morrow at noon.  if by then you don’t do
what i bid you to do, the whole world shall know the origin of robert
chiltern.

sir robert chiltern.  show mrs. cheveley out.

to_ lady chiltern, _who makes no sign of response_.  _as she passes by_
sir robert chiltern, _who is standing close to the door_, _she pauses for
a moment and looks him straight in the face_.  _she then goes out_,
_followed by the servant_, _who closes the door after him_.  _the husband
and wife are left alone_.  lady chiltern _stands like some one in a
dreadful dream_.  _then she turns round and

lady chiltern.  you sold a cabinet secret for money!  you began your life
with fraud!  you built up your career on dishonour!  oh, tell me it is
not true!  lie to me!  lie to me!  tell me it is not true!

sir robert chiltern.  what this woman said is quite true.  but, gertrude,
listen to me.  you don’t realise how i was tempted.  let me tell you the
whole thing. [_goes towards her_.]

lady chiltern.  don’t come near me.  don’t touch me.  i feel as if you
had soiled me for ever.  oh! what a mask you have been wearing all these
years!  a horrible painted mask!  you sold yourself for money.  oh! a
common thief were better.  you put yourself up to sale to the highest
bidder!  you were bought in the market.  you l

of things that made me love you—memories of words that made me love
you—memories that now are horrible to me.  and how i worshipped you!  you
were to me something apart from common life, a thing pure, noble, honest,
without stain.  the world seemed to me finer because you were in it, and

sir robert chiltern.  there was your mistake.  there was your error.  the
error all women commit.  why can’t you women love us, faults and all?
why do you place us on monstrous pedestals?  we have all feet of clay,
women as well as men; but when we men love women, we love them knowing
their weaknesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them all the
more, it may be, for that reason.  it is not the perfect, but the
imperfect, who have need of love.  it is when we are wounded by our own

sir.  you have got to get married, and at once.  why, when i was your
age, sir, i had been an inconsolable widower for three months, and was
already paying my addresses to your admirable mother.  damme, sir, it is
your duty to get married.  you can’t be always living for pleasure.
every man of position is married nowadays.  bachelors are not fashionable
any more.  they are a damaged lot.  too much is known about them.  you
must get a wife, sir.  look where your friend robert chiltern has got to
by probity, hard work, and a sensible marriage with a good woman.  why
don’t you imitate him, sir?  why don’t you take him for your model?

lord goring.  i think i shall, father.

lord caversham.  i wish you would, sir.  then i should be happy.  at
present i make your mother’s life miserable on your account.  you are
heartless, sir, quite heartless.

lord goring.  i hope not, father.

lord caversham.  and it is high time for you to get married.  you are

sir robert chiltern.  my dear arthur, what a piece of good luck meeting
you on the doorstep!  your servant had just told me you were not at home.
how extraordinary!

lord goring.  the fact is, i am horribly busy to-night, robert, and i
gave orders i was not at home to any one.  even my father had a
comparatively cold reception.  he complained of a draught the whole time.

expression of your face as you came in.  who told her?

sir robert chiltern.  mrs. cheveley herself.  and the woman i love knows
that i began my career with an act of low dishonesty, that i built up my
life upon sands of shame—that i sold, like a common huckster, the secret

sir robert chiltern.  nothing is absolutely known against her.  on the
contrary, she occupies a rather high position in society.  it is a sort
of open secret that baron arnheim left her the greater portion of his
immense fortune.  beyond that i can learn nothing.

lord goring.  she doesn’t turn out to be a spy, then?

women do—pitiless in her perfection—cold and stern and without mercy.

the drawing-room_.]  what is that?

lord goring.  nothing.

mrs. cheveley.  far more!  i have greatly improved.  i have had more

lord goring.  too much experience is a dangerous thing.  pray have a
cigarette.  half the pretty women in london smoke cigarettes.  personally
i prefer the other half.

mrs. cheveley.  thanks.  i never smoke.  my dressmaker wouldn’t like it,
and a woman’s first duty in life is to her dressmaker, isn’t it?  what
the second duty is, no one has as yet discovered.

have arrived at the romantic stage.  when i saw you last night at the

ever have cared for anybody, arthur.  and so, on the morning of the day
you marry me, i will give you robert chiltern’s letter.  that is my

mrs. cheveley.  [_smiling_.]  to-morrow.

mrs. cheveley.  yes, quite serious.

mrs. cheveley.  i don’t mind bad husbands.  i have had two.  they amused
me immensely.

s quite charming of you to be so rude to
a woman in your own house?

lord goring.  in the case of very fascinating women, sex is a challenge,
not a defence.

mrs. cheveley.  i suppose that is meant for a compliment.  my dear
arthur, women are never disarmed by compliments.  men always are.  that
is the difference between the two sexes.

lord goring.  women are never disarmed by anything, as far as i know
them.

mrs. cheveley.  [_after a pause_.]  then you are going to allow your
greatest friend, robert chiltern, to be ruined, rather than marry some
one who really has considerable attractions left.  i thought you would
have risen to some great height of self-sacrifice, arthur.  i think you
should.  and the rest of your life you could spend in contemplating your
own perfections.

lord goring.  oh! i do that as it is.  and self-sacrifice is a thing that
should be put down by law.  it is so demoralising to the people for whom
one sacrifices oneself.  they always go to the bad.

envelope—and i read it—oh! i did not care what disgrace or punishment was
in store for me, i only thought you loved me still.

lady chiltern.  there is no disgrace in store for you, nor any public
shame.  mrs. cheveley has handed over to lord goring the document that
was in her possession, and he

sir robert chiltern.  are you sure of this, gertrude?

lady chiltern.  yes; lord goring has just told me.

sir robert chiltern.  then i am safe!  oh! what a wonderful thing to be
safe!  for two days i have been in terror.  i am safe now.  how did
arthur destroy my letter?  tell me.

lady chiltern.  he burned it.

their past burning to white ashes before them!  is arthur still here?

lady chiltern.  yes; he is in the conservatory.

sir robert chiltern.  i am so glad now i made that speech last night in

result.  but it has not been so.

lady chiltern.  oh, my ambition!  i have none now, but that

[lord goring _returns from the conservatory_, _looking very pleased with
himself_, _and with an entirely new buttonhole that some one has made for
him_.]

sir robert chiltern.  [_going towards him_.]  arthur, i have to thank you
for what you have done for me.  i don’t know how i can repay you.

lord goring.  my dear fellow, i’ll tell you at once.  at the present
moment, under the usual palm tree . . . i mean in the conservatory . . .

lord goring.  that admirable father of mine really makes a habit of
turning up at the wrong moment.  it is very heartless of him, very
heartless indeed.

_ lord caversham.  mason _goes out_.]

lord caversham.  good morning, lady chiltern!  warmest congratulations to
you, chiltern, on your brilliant speech last night.  i have just left the
prime minister, and you are to have the vacant seat in the cabinet.

sir robert chiltern.  [_with a look of joy and triumph_.]  a seat in the
cabinet?

lord caversham.  yes; here is the prime minister’s letter.  [_hands
letter_.]

sir robert chiltern.  [_takes letter and reads it_.]  a seat in the
cabinet!

lord caversham.  certainly, and you well deserve it too.  you have got
what we want so much in political life nowadays—high character, high
moral tone, high principles.  [_to_ lord goring.]  everything that you
have not got, sir, and never will have.

lord goring.  i don’t like principles, father.  i prefer prejudices.

[sir robert chiltern _is on the brink of accepting the prime minister’s
offer_, _when he sees wife looking at him

 with her clear_, _candid eyes_.
_he then realises that it is impossible_.]

sir robert chiltern.  i cannot accept this offer, lord caversham.  i have
made up my mind to decline it.

lord caversham.  decline it, sir!

sir robert chiltern.  my intention is to retire at once from public life.

lord caversham.  [_angrily_.]  decline a seat in the cabinet, and retire
from public life?  never heard such damned nonsense in the whole course
of my existence.  i beg your pardon, lady chiltern.  chiltern, i beg your
pardon.  [_to_ lord goring.]  don’t grin like that, sir.

lord goring.  no, father.

lord caversham.  lady chiltern, you are a sensible woman, the most
sensible woman in london, the most sensible woman i know.  will you

lady chiltern.  i think my husband in right in his determination, lord
caversham.  i approve of it.

lord caversham.  you approve of it?  good heavens!

lady chiltern.  [_taking her husband’s hand_.]  i admire him for it.  i
admire him immensely for it.  i have never admired him so much before.
he is finer than even i thought him.  [_to_ sir robert chiltern.]  you
will go and write your letter to the prime minister now, won’t you?
don’t hesitate about it, robert.

sir robert chiltern.  [_with a touch of bitterness_.]  i suppose i had
better write it at once.  such offers are not repeated.  i will ask you
to excuse me for a moment, lord caversham.

lady chiltern.  i may come with you, robert, may i not?

sir robert chiltern.  yes, gertrude.

read it to you?

lady chiltern.  let me see it.

[sir robert _hands her the letter_.  _she reads it_, _and then_, _with a
gesture of passion_, _tears it up_.]

sir robert chiltern.  what are you doing?

lady chiltern.  a man’s life is of more value than a woman’s.  it has
larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions.  our lives revolve in
curves of emotions.  it is upon lines of intellect that a man’s life

sses.  i have just learnt this, and much else with it, from lord
goring.  and i will not spoil your life for you, nor see you spoil it as
a sacrifice to me, a useless sacrifice!

sir robert chiltern.  gertrude!  gertrude!

lady chiltern.  you can forget.  men easily forget.  and i forgive.  that
is how women help the world.  i see that now.

sir robert chiltern.  [_deeply overcome by emotion_, _embraces her_.]  my
wife! my wife!  [_to_ lord goring.]  arthur, it seems that i am always to
be in your debt.

lord goring.  oh dear no, robert.  your debt is to lady chiltern, not to
me!

sir robert chiltern.  i owe you much.  and now tell me what you were
going to ask me just now as lord caversham came in.

lord goring.  robert, you are your sister’s guardian, and i want your
consent to my marriage with her.  that is all.

lady chiltern.  oh, i am so glad!

  i am so glad!  [_shakes hands with_
lord goring.]

lord goring.  thank you, lady chiltern.

sir robert chiltern.  [_with a troubled look_.]  my sister to be your
wife?

lord goring.  yes.

sir robert chiltern.  [_speaking with great firmness_.]  arthur, i am
very sorry, but the thing is quite out of the question.  i have to think
of mabel’s future happiness.  and i don’t think her happiness would be
safe in your hands.  and i cannot have her sacrificed!

lord goring.  sacrificed!

sir robert chiltern.  yes, utterly sacrificed.  loveless marriages are
horrible.  but there is one thing worse than an absolutely loveless
marriage.  a marriage in which there is love, but on one side only;
faith, but on one side only; devotion, but on one side only, and in which
of the two hearts one is sure to be broken.

lord goring.  but i love mabel.  no other woman has any place in my life.

lady chiltern.  robert, if they love each other, why should they not be
married?

sir robert chiltern.  arthur cannot

bring mabel the love that she
deserves.

lord goring.  what reason have you for saying that?

sir robert chiltern.  [_after a pause_.]  do you really require me to
tell you?

lord goring.  certainly i do.

sir robert chiltern.  as you choose.  when i called on you yesterday
evening i found mrs. cheveley concealed in your rooms.  it was between
ten and eleven o’clock at night.  i do not wish to say anything more.
your relations with mrs. cheveley have, as i said to you last night,
nothing whatsoever to do with me.  i know you were engaged to be married
to her once.  the fascination she exercised over you then seems to have
returned.  you spoke to me last night of her as of a woman pure and
stainless, a woman whom y

ou respected and honoured.  that may be so.  but
i cannot give my sister’s life into your hands.  it would be wrong of me.
it would be unjust, infamously unjust to her.

lord goring.  i have nothing more to say.

lady chiltern.  robert, it was not mrs. cheveley whom lord goring
expected last night.

sir robert chiltern.  not mrs. cheveley!  who was it then?

lord goring.  lady chiltern!

lady chiltern.  it was your own wife.  robert, yesterday afternoon lord
goring told me that if ever i was in trouble i could come to him for
help, as he was our oldest and best friend.  later on, after that
terrible scene in this room, i wrote to him telling him that i trusted
him, that i had need of him, that i was coming to him for help and
advice.  [sir robert chiltern _takes the letter out of his pocket_.]

mrs. cheveley went.  she stole my letter and sent it anonymously to you
this morning, that you should think . . . oh! robert, i cannot tell you
what she wished you to think. . . .

sir robert chiltern.  what!  had i fallen so low in your eyes that you
thought that even for a moment i could have doubted your goodness?
gertrude, gertrude, you are to me the white image of all good things, and
sin can never touch you.  arthur, you can go to mabel, and you have my
best wishes!  oh! stop a moment.  there is no name at the beginning of
this letter.  the brilliant mrs. cheveley does not seem to have noticed
that.  there should be a name.

lady chiltern.  let me write yours.  it is you i trust and ne

lord caversham.  what do you want him to be then, dear?

mabel chiltern.  he can be what he chooses.  all i want is to be . . . to

lord caversham.  upon my word, there is a good deal of common sense in
that, lady chiltern.

for him_.]

lady chiltern.  [_leaning over the back of the chair_.]  aren’t you
coming in, robert?

sir robert chiltern.  [_taking her hand_.]  gertrude, is it love you feel
for me, or is it pity merely?

lady chiltern.  [_kisses him_.]  it is love, robert.  love, and only
love.  for both of us a new life is beginning.
