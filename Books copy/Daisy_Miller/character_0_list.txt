Daisy Miller - 
                A
rich, pretty, American girl traveling through Europe with her mother
and younger brother. Daisy wants to be exposed to European high
society but refuses to conform to
old-world notions of propriety laid down by the expatriate community
there. In Rome, she becomes involved with an Italian man named Giovanelli,
and she eventually dies from malaria as a result of being outside
with him at night. Along with Winterbourne, Daisy is the novel's
other possible protagonist.
