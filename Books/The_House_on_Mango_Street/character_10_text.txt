ike marimbas only with a funny 
little  plucked  sound  to  it  like  if you  were  running  your 
fingers across the teeth of a  metal comb. 

and then i don't know why, but i have to turn around 
and pretend i don't care about the box so nenny won't see 
how  stupid  i  am.  but nenny,  who  is  stupider, already  is 
asking how  much and  i can see her fingers  going for the 
quarters in  her pants pocket. 

this,  the old  man says shutting the lid,  this ain't for 

sale. 

mettle ortiz. 

meme ortiz moved into cathy's house after her family 
moved away. his name isn't really meme. his name isjuan. 
but when we asked him what his name was he said meme, 
and that's what everybody calls  him except his  mother. 

meme has a dog with gray eyes, a sheepdog with two 
names, one in english and one in spanish. the dog is big, 
like  a  man dressed  in  a  dog suit,  and  runs the same way 
its owner does, clumsy and wild and with the limbs flopping 
allover the place like  untied shoes.
