d little likely to be effaced. i can recall even now with vivid
distinctness every feature of the scene. the umbrageous shades where
the interview took place--the glorious tropical vegetation around--the
picturesque grouping of the mingled throng of soldiery and natives--and
even the golden-hued bunch of bananas that i held in my hand at the
time, and of which i occasionally partook while making the aforesaid
philosophical reflections.



chapter five

thoughts previous to attempting an escape--toby, a fellow sailor, agrees
to share the adventure--last night aboard the ship

having fully resolved to leave the vessel clandestinely, and having
acquired all the knowledge concerning the bay that i could obtain under
the circumstances in which i was placed, i now deliberately turned over
in my mind every plan to escape that suggested itself, being determined
to act with all possible prudence in an attempt where failure would be
attended with so many disagreeable consequences. the idea of being

fastnesses.

i had determined not to communicate my design of withdrawing from the
vessel to any of my shipmates, and least of all to solicit any one to
accompany me in my flight. but it so happened one night, that being upon
deck, revolving over in my mind various plans of escape, i perceived one
of the shipâ€™s company leaning over the bulwarks, apparently plunged in a
profound reverie. he was a young fellow about my own age, for whom i
had all along entertained a great regard; and toby, such was the name
by which he went among us, for his real name he would never tell us, was
every way worthy of it. he was active, ready and obliging, of dauntless
courage, and singularly open and fearless in the expression of his
feelings. i had on more than one occasion got him out of scrapes into
which this had led him; and i know not whether it was from this cause,
or a certain congeniality of sentiment between us, that he had always
shown a partiality for my society. we had battled out man

together, beguiling the weary hours with chat, song, and story, mingled
with a good many imprecations upon the hard destiny it seemed our common
fortune to encounter.

toby, like myself, had evidently moved in a different sphere of life,
and his conversation at times betrayed this, although he was anxious
to conceal it. he was one of that class of rovers you sometimes meet
at sea, who never reveal their origin, never allude to home, and go
rambling over the world as if pursued by some mysterious fate they
cannot possibly elude.

there was much even in the appearance of toby calculated to draw me
towards him, for while the greater part of the crew were as coarse in

person as in mind, toby was endowed with a remarkably prepossessing
exterior. arrayed in his blue frock and duck trousers, he was as smart a
looking sailor as ever stepped upon a deck; he was singularly small
and slightly made, with great flexibility of limb. his naturally dark
complexion had been deepened by exposure to the tropical sun, and a mass
of jetty locks clustered about his temples, and threw a darker shade
into his large black eyes. he was a strange wayward being, moody,
fitful, and melancholy--at times alm

when thoroughly roused, transported him into a state
bordering on delirium.

it is strange the power that a mind of deep passion has over feebler
natures. i have seen a brawny, fellow, with no lack of ordinary courage,
fairly quail before this slender stripling, when in one of his curious
fits. but these paroxysms seldom occurred, and in them my big-hearted
shipmate vented the bile which more calm-tempered individuals get rid of
by a continual pettishness at trivial annoyances.

no one ever saw toby laugh. i mean in the hearty abandonment of
broad-mouthed mirth. he did smile sometimes, it is true; and there was
a good deal of dry, sarcastic humour about him, which told the more from
the imperturbable gravity of his tone and manner.

latterly i had observed that tobyâ€™s melancholy had greatly increased,
and i had frequently seen him since our arrival at the island gazing
wistfully upon the shore, when the remainder of the crew would be
rioting below. i was aware that he entertained a cordi

al detestation
of the ship, and believed that, should a fair chance of escape present
itself, he would embrace it willingly.

but the attempt was so perilous in the place where we then lay, that
i supposed myself the only individual on board the ship who was
sufficiently reckless to think of it. in this, however, i was mistaken.

when i perceived toby leaning, as i have mentioned, against the bulwarks
and buried in thought, it struck me at once that the subject of his
meditations might be the same as my own. and if it be so, thought i,
is he not the very one of all my shipmates whom i would choose: for the
partner of my adventure? and why should i not have some comrade with me
to divide its dangers and alleviate its hardships? perhaps i might be
obliged to lie concealed among the mountains for weeks. in such an event
what a solace would a co

mpanion be?

these thoughts passed rapidly through my mind, and i wondered why i had
not before considered the matter in this light. but it was not too late.
a tap upon the shoulder served to rouse toby from his reverie; i found
him ripe for the enterprise, and a very few words sufficed for a mutual
understanding between us. in an hourâ€™s time we had arranged all the
preliminaries, and decided upon our plan of action. we then ratified our
engagement with an affectionate wedding of palms, and to elude suspicion
repaired each to his hammock, to spend the last night on board the
dolly.

the next day the starboard watch, to which we both belonged, was to be
sent ashore on liberty; and, availing o

 him as a lying old son of a seacook who begrudged a fellow a
few hoursâ€™ liberty, exclaimed with an oath, â€˜but you donâ€™t bounce me out
of my liberty, old chap, for all your yarns; for i would go ashore if
every pebble on the beach was a live coal, and every stick a gridiron,
and the cannibals stood ready to broil me on landing.â€™

the spirit of this sentiment was responded to by all hands, and we
resolved that in spite of the captainâ€™s croakings we would make a
glorious day of it.

but toby and i had our own game to play, and we availed ourselves of
the confusion which always reigns among a shipâ€™s company preparatory to
going ashore, to confer together and complete our arrangements. as our
object was to effect as rapid a flight as possible to the mountains, we
determined not to encumber ourselves with any superfluous apparel; and
accordingly, while the rest were rigging themselves out with some idea
of making a display, we were content to put on new stout duck trousers,
servicea

ble pumps, and heavy havre-frocks, which with a payta hat
completed our equipment.

when our shipmates wondered at this, toby exclaimed in his odd grave way
that the rest might do, as they liked, but that he for one preserved
his go-ashore traps for the spanish main, where the tie of a sailorâ€™s
neckerchief might make some difference; but as for a parcel of
unbreeched heathen, he wouldnâ€™t go to the bottom of his chest for any
of them, and was half disposed to appear among them in buff himself. the
men laughed at what they thought was one of his strange conceits, and so
we escaped suspicion.

it may appear singular

and by the time we
had affected a landing it poured down in torrents. we fled for shelter
under cover of an immense canoe-house which stood hard by the beach, and
waited for the first fury of the storm to pass.

it continued, however, without cessation; and the monotonous beating of
the rain over head began to exert a drowsy influence upon the men, who,
throwing themselves here and there upon the large war-canoes, after
chatting awhile, all fell asleep.

this was the opportunity we desired, and toby and i availed ourselves
of it at once by stealing out of the canoe-house and plunging into the
depths of an extensive grove that was in its rear. after ten minutesâ€™
rapid progress we gained an open space from which we could just descry
the ridge we intended to mount looming dimly through the mists of the
tropical shower, and distant from us, as we estimated, something more
than a mile. our direct course towards it lay through a rather populous
part of the bay; but desirous as we were of evadi

etely saturated with water, and by their weight, and that of
the articles we had concealed beneath them, not a little impeded our
progress. but it was no time to pause when at any moment we might be
surprised by a body of the savages, and forced at the very outset to
relinquish our undertaking.

since leaving the canoe-house we had scarcely exchanged a single
syllable with one another; but when we entered a second narrow opening
in the wood, and again caught sight of the ridge before us, i took toby
by the arm, and pointing along its sloping outline to the lofty heights
at its extremity, said in a low tone, â€˜now, toby, not a word, nor a
glance backward, till we stand on the summit of yonder mountain--so no
more lingering but let us shove ahead while we can, and in a few hoursâ€™
time we may laugh aloud. you are the lightest and the nimblest, so lead
on, and i will follow.â€™

â€˜all right, brother,â€™ said toby, â€˜quickâ€™s our play; only lets keep close
together, thatâ€™s all;â€™ and s

ickly as they could
stand, and as tough and stubborn as so many rods of steel; and we
perceived, to our chagrin, that they extended midway up the elevation we
proposed to ascend.

for a moment we gazed about us in quest of a more practicable route; it
was, however, at once apparent that there was no resource but to pierce
this thicket of canes at all hazards. we now reversed our order of
march, i, being the heaviest, taking the lead, with a view of breaking a
path through the obstruction, while toby fell into the rear.

two or three times i endeavoured to insinuate myself between the canes,
and by dint of coaxing and bending them to make some progress; but a
bull-frog might as well have tried to work a passage through the teeth
of a comb, and i gave up the attempt in despair.

half wild with meeting an obstacle we had so little anticipated, i threw
myself desperately against it, crushing to the ground the canes with
which i came in contact, and, rising to my feet again, repeated the
action

 with like effect. twenty minutes of this violent exercise almost
exhausted me, but it carried us some way into the thicket; when toby,
who had been reaping the benefit of my labours by following close at my
heels, proposed to become pioneer in turn, and accordingly passed ahead
with a view of affording me a respite from my exertions. as however
with his slight frame he made but bad work of it, i was soon obliged to
resume my old place again. on we toiled, the perspiration starting from
our bodies in floods, our limbs torn and lacerated with the splintered
fragments of the broken canes, until we had proceeded perhaps as far
as

surrounding objects, and we were not certain but that we might have been
going all the time in a wrong direction.

fatigued with my long-continued efforts, and panting for breath, i felt
myself completely incapacitated for any further exertion. i rolled up
the sleeve of my frock, and squeezed the moisture it contained into
my parched mouth. but the few drops i managed to obtain gave me little
relief, and i sank down for a moment with a sort of dogged apathy, from
which i was aroused by toby, who had devised a plan to free us from the
net in which we had become entangled.

he was laying about him lustily with his sheath-knive, lopping the canes
right and left, like a reaper, and soon made quite a clearing around us.
this sight reanimated me; and seizing my own knife, i hacked and hewed
away without mercy. but alas! the farther we advanced the thicker and
taller, and apparently the more interminable, the reeds became.

i began to think we were fairly snared, and had almost made up m

y mind
that without a pair of wings we should never be able to escape from the
toils; when all at once i discerned a peep of daylight through the canes
on my right, and, communicating the joyful tidings to toby, we both fell
to with fresh spirit, and speedily opening the passage towards it we
found ourselves clear of perplexities, and in the near vicinity of the
ridge. after resting for a few moments we began the ascent, and after
a little vigorous climbing found ourselves close to its summit. instead
however of walking along its ridge, where we should have been in full
view of the natives in the vales beneath, and at a point where they
could easily intercept us were they so inclined, we cautiously ad

we had ascended it near the place of its termination and at its lowest
point, and now saw our route to the mountains distinctly defined along
its narrow crest, which was covered with a soft carpet of verdure, and
was in many parts only a few feet wide.

elated with the success which had so far attended our enterprise, and
invigorated by the refreshing atmosphere we now inhaled, toby and i in
high spirits were making our way rapidly along the ridge, when suddenly
from the valleys below which lay on either side of us we heard the
distant shouts of the natives, who had just descried us, and to whom our
figures, brought in bold relief against the sky, were plainly revealed.

glancing our eyes into these valleys, we perceived their savage
inhabitants hurrying to and fro, seemingly under the influence of some
sudden alarm, and appearing to the eye scarcely bigger than so many

the other side of the mountain--disappointment--inventory of articles
brought from the ship--division of the stock of bread--appearance of
the interior of the island--a discovery--a ravine and waterfalls--a
sleepless night--further discoveries--my illness--a marquesan landscape

my curiosity had been not a little raised with regard to the description
of country we should meet on the other side of the mountains; and i had
supposed, with toby, that immediately on gaining the heights we should
be enabled to view the large bays of happar and typee reposing at our
feet on one side, in the same way that nukuheva lay spread out below
on the other. but here we were disappointed. instead of finding the
mountain we had ascended sweeping down in the opposite direction into
broad and capacious valleys, the land appeared to retain its general
elevation, only broken into a series of ridges and inter-vales which
so far as the eye could reach str

 the dolly would not sail perhaps for ten days, and
how were we to sustain life during this period? i bitterly repented our
improvidence in not providing ourselves, as we easily might have done,
with a supply of biscuits. with a rueful visage i now bethought me of
the scanty handful of bread i had stuffed into the bosom of my frock,
and felt somewhat desirous to ascertain what part of it had weathered
the rather rough usage it had experienced in ascending the mountain.
i accordingly proposed to toby that we should enter into a joint
examination of the various articles we had brought from the ship.

with this intent we seated ourselves upon the grass; and a little
curious to see with what kind of judgement my companion had filled
his frock--which i remarked seemed about as well lined as my own--i
requested him to commence operations by spreading out its contents.

thrusting his hand, then, into the bosom of this capacious receptacle,
he first brought to light about a pound of tobacco, whose

parts still adhered together, the whole outside being covered with
soft particles of sea-bread. wet and dripping, it had the appearance of
having been just recovered from the bottom of the sea. but i paid
slight attention to a substance of so little value to us in our present
situation, as soon as i perceived the indications it gave of tobyâ€™s
foresight in laying in a supply of food for the expedition.

i eagerly inquired what quantity he had brought with him, when rummaging
once more beneath his garment, he produced a small handful of something
so soft, pulpy, and discoloured, that for a few moments he was as
much puzzled as myself to tell by what possible instrumentality such
a villainous compound had become engendered in his bosom. i can only
describe it as a hash of soaked bread and bits of tobacco, brought to
a doughy consis

but repulsive as it might otherwise have been, i now regarded it as
an invaluable treasure, and proceeded with great care to transfer this
paste-like mass to a large leaf which i had plucked from a bush beside
me. toby informed me that in the morning he had placed two whole
biscuits in his bosom, with a view of munching them, should he feel so
inclined, during our flight. these were now reduced to the equivocal
substance which i had just placed on the leaf.

another dive into the frock brought to view some four or five yards of
calico print, whose tasteful pattern was rather disfigured by the yellow
stains of the tobacco with which it had been brought in contact. in
drawing this calico slowly from his bosom i

me of a juggler performing the feat of the endless ribbon. the next
cast was a small one, being a sailorâ€™s little â€˜ditty bagâ€™, containing
needles, thread, and other sewing utensils, then came a razor-case,
followed by two or three separate plugs of negro-head, which were fished
up from the bottom of the now empty receptacle. these various matters,
being inspected, i produced the few things which i had myself brought.

as might have been anticipated from the state of my companionâ

venture.
after a brief discussion, in which we both of us expressed our
resolution of not descending into the bay until the shipâ€™s departure,
i suggested to my companion that little of it as there was, we should
divide the bread into six equal portions, each of which should be a
dayâ€™s allowance for both of us. this proposition he assented to; so i
took the silk kerchief from my neck, and cutting it with my knife into
half a dozen equal pieces, proceeded to make an exact division.

at first, toby with a degree of fastidiousness that seemed to me
ill-timed, was for picking out the minute particles of tobacco
with which the spongy mass was mixed; but against this proceeding i
protested, as by such an operation we must have greatly diminished its
quantity.

when the division was accomplished, we found that a dayâ€™s allowance for
the two was not a great deal more than what a table-spoon might hold.
each separate portion we immediately rolled up in the bit of silk
prepared for it, and joini

committed them, with solemn injunctions of fidelity, to the custody of
toby. for the remainder of that day we resolved to fast, as we had been
fortified by a breakfast in the morning; and now starting again to our
feet, we looked about us for a shelter during the night, which, from the
appearance of the heavens, promised to be a dark and tempestuous one.

there was no place near us which would in any way answer our purpose,
so turning our backs upon nukuheva, we commenced exploring the unknown
regions which lay upon the other side of the mountain.

robinson crusoe could not have been more startled at the footprint in
the sand than we were at this unwelcome discovery. my first impulse was
to make as rapid a retreat as possible, and bend our steps in some
other direction; but our curiosity to see whither this path might lead,
prompted us to pursue it. so on we went, the track becoming more and
more visible the farther we proceeded, until it conducted us to the
verge of the ravine, where it abruptly terminated.

â€˜and so,â€™ said toby, peering down into the chasm, â€˜everyone that travels
this path takes a jump here, eh?â€™

â€˜not so,â€™ said i, â€˜for i think they might manage to descend without it;
what say you,--shall we attempt the feat?â€™

â€˜and what, in the name of caves and coal-holes, do you expect to find at
the bottom of that gulf but a broken neck--why it looks blacker than our
shipâ€™s hold, and the roar of those waterfalls down there would batter
oneâ€™s brains to pieces.â€™

â€˜oh, no, toby,â€™ i exclaimed, 
 
 ___________________________
 
laughing; â€˜but thereâ€™s something to be seen
here, thatâ€™s plain, or there would have been no path, and i am resolved
to find out what it is.â€™

â€˜i will tell you what, my pleasant fellow,â€™ rejoined toby quickly, â€˜if
you are going to pry into everything you meet with here that excites
your curiosity, you will marvellously soon get knocked on the head; to
a dead certainty you will come bang upon a party of these savages in the
midst of your discovery-makings, and i doubt whether such an event would
particularly delight you, just take my advice for once, and let us â€˜bout
ship and steer in some other direction; besides, itâ€™s getting late and
we ought to be mooring ourselves for the night.â€™
 
 ___________________________
 


â€˜that is just the thing i have been driving at,â€™ replied i; â€˜and i am
thinking that this ravine will exactly answer our purpose, for it is
roomy, secluded, well watered, and may shelter us from the weather.â€™

â€˜aye, and from sleep too, and by the same token will give us sore
throats, and rheumatisms into the bargain,â€™ cried toby, with evident
dislike at the idea.

â€˜oh, very well then, my lad,â€™ said i, â€˜since you will not accompany me,
here i go alone. you will see me in the morning;â€™ and advancing to the
edge of the cliff upon which we had been standing, i proceeded to lower
myself down by the tangled roots which clustered about all the crevices
of the rock. as i had anticipated, toby, in spite of his previous
remonstrances, followed my example, and dropping himself with the
activity of a squirrel from point to

ring how it was that what we had taken for a path should have
conducted us to so singular a place, and began to suspect that after all
i might have been deceived in supposing it to have been a trick
formed by the islanders. this was rather an agreeable reflection than
otherwise, for it diminished our dread of accidentally meeting with any
of them, and i came to the conclusion that perhaps we could not have
selected a more secure hiding-place than this very spot we had so
accidentally hit upon.

toby agreed with me in this view of the matter, and we immediately began
gathering together the limbs of trees which lay scattered about, with
the view of constructing a temporary hut for the night. this we were
obliged to build close to the foot of the cataract, for the current of
water extended very nearly to the sides of the gorge. the few moments
of light that remained we employed in covering our hut with a species of
broad-bladed grass that grew in every fissure of the ravine. our hut,
if it de
 
 ___________________________
 
served to be called one, consisted of six or eight of the
straightest branches we could find laid obliquely against the steep wall
of rock, with their lower ends within a foot of the stream. into the
space thus covered over we managed to crawl, and dispose our wearied
bodies as best we could.

shall i ever forget that horrid night! as for poor toby, i could
scarcely get a word out of him. it would have been some consolation to
have heard his voice, but he lay shivering the live-long night like a
man afflicted with the palsy, with his knees drawn up to his head, while
his back was supported against the dripping side of the rock. during
this wretched night there seemed nothing wanting to complete the perfect
misery of our condition. the rain descended in such torrents that our
poor shelter proved a mere mockery. in vain did i try to elude t

through which to drench us.

i have had many a ducking in the course of my life, and in general
cared little about it; but the accumulated horrors of that night, the
deathlike coldness of the place, the appalling darkness and the dismal
sense of our forlorn condition, almost unmanned me.

it will not be doubted that the next morning we were early risers, and
as soon as i could catch the faintest glimpse of anything like daylight
i shook my companion by the arm, and told him it was sunrise. poor toby
lifted up his head, and after a momentâ€™s pause said, in a husky voice,
â€˜then, shipmate, my toplights have gone out, for it appears darker now
with my eyes open that it did when they were shut.â€™

â€˜nonsense!â€™ exclaimed i; â€˜you are not awake yet.â€™

â€˜awake!â€™ roared toby in a rage, â€˜awake! you mean to insinuate iâ€™ve been
asleep, do you? it is an insult to a man to suppose he could sleep in
such an infernal place as this.â€™

by the time i had apologized to my friend for having

of obtaining a certain root, from which the natives obtained a kind of
ointment.

these discoveries immediately determined us to abandon a place which
had presented no inducement for us to remain, except the promise of
security; and as we looked about us for the means of ascending again
into the upper regions, we at last found a practicable part of the rock,
and half an hourâ€™s toil carried us to the summit of the same cliff from
which the preceding evening we had descended.

i now proposed to toby that instead of rambling about the island,
exposing ourselves to discovery at every turn, we should select some
place as our fixed abode for as long a period as our food should
hold out, build ourselves a comfortable hut, and be as prudent and
circumspect as possible. to all this my companion assented, and we at
once set about carrying the plan into execution.

with this view, after exploring without success a little glen near us,
we crossed several of the ridges of which i have before spoken; 
 
 ___________________________
 
, lest, like the enchanted gardens in the fairy
tale, a single syllable might dissolve the spell. for a long time,
forgetful alike of my own situation, and the vicinity of my still
slumbering companion, i remained gazing around me, hardly able to
comprehend by what means i had thus suddenly been made a spectator of
such a scene.



chapter eight

the important question, typee or happar?--a wild goose chase--my
sufferings--disheartening situation--a night in a ravine--morning
meal--happy idea of toby--journey towards the valley

recovering from my astonishment at the beautiful scene before me, i
quickly awakened toby, and informed him of the discovery i had made.
together we now repaired to the border of the precipice, and my
companionâ€™s admiration was equal to my own. a little reflection,
however, abated our surprise at coming so unexpectedly upon this valley,
since the large vales of happar and typee, lying upon this side of
nukuheva, and extending a considerable distance from the sea t
 
 ___________________________
 
owards the
interior, must necessarily terminate somewhere about this point.

the question now was as to which of those two places we were looking
down upon. toby insisted that it was the abode of the happar, and i that
it was tenanted by their enemies the ferocious typees. to be sure i was
not entirely convinced by my own arguments, but tobyâ€™s proposition to
descend at once into the valley, and partake of the hospitality of its
inmates, seemed to me to be risking so much upon the strength of a mere
supposition, that i resolved to oppose it until we had more evidence to
proceed upon.

the point was one of vital importance, as the natives of happar were
not only at peace with nukuheva, but cultivated with its inhabitants the
most friendly relations, and enjoyed besides a reputation for gentleness
and humanity which led us to expect

these we would be obliged to cross before we could hope to arrive at our
destination.

a weary journey! but we decided to undertake it, though, for my own
part, i felt little prepared to encounter its fatigues, shivering and
burning by turns with the ague and fever; for i know not how else to
describe the alternate sensations i experienced, and suffering not
a little from the lameness which afflicted me. added to this was the
faintness consequent on our meagre diet--a calamity in which toby
participated to the same extent as myself.

these circumstances, however, only augmented my anxiety to reach a place
which promised us plenty and repose, before i should be reduced to a
state which would render me altogether unable to perform the journey.
accordingly we now commenced it by descending the almost perpendicular
side of a steep and narrow gorge, bristling with a thick growth of
reeds. here there was but one mode for us to adopt. we seated ourselves
upon the ground, and guided our d

site side of the gorge--an operation rendered the less agreeable
from the consideration that in these perpendicular episodes we did not
progress a hundred yards on our journey. but, ungrateful as the task
was, we set about it with exemplary patience, and after a snail-like
progress of an hour or more, had scaled perhaps one half of the
distance, when the fever which had left me for a while returned with
such violence, and accompanied by so raging a thirst, that it required
all the entreaties of toby to prevent me from losing all the fruits of
my late exertion, by precipitating myself madly down the cliffs we had
just climbed, in quest of the water which flowed so temptingly at their
base. at the moment all my hopes and fears appeared to be merged in
this one desire, careless of the consequences that might result from its
gratification. i am aware of no feeling, either of pleasure or of pain,
that so completely deprives one of an power to resist its impulses, as
this same raging thirst.

distance; and, discouraged as i was by other circumstances, this
prospect plunged me into the very depths of despair. nothing but dark
and fearful chasms, separated by sharp-crested and perpendicular ridges
as far as the eye could reach. could we have stepped from summit
to summit of these steep but narrow elevations we could easily have
accomplished the distance; but we must penetrate to the bottom of every
yawning gulf, and scale in succession every one of the eminences before
us. even toby, although not suffering as i did, was not proof against
the disheartening influences of the sight.

but we did not long stand to contemplate it, impatient as i was to reach
the waters of the torrent which flowed beneath us. with an insensibility
to danger which i cannot call to mind without shuddering, we threw
ourselves down the depths of the ravine, startling its savage solitudes
with the echoes produced by the falling fragments of rock we every
moment dislodged from their places, careless of

movement--a systematic going over of the already trodden ground:
and especially if he has a love of adventure, such a course appears
indescribably repulsive, so long as there remains the least hope to be
derived from braving untried difficulties.

it was this feeling that prompted us to descend the opposite side of the
elevation we had just scaled, although with what definite object in view
it would have been impossible for either of us to tell.

without exchanging a syllable upon the subject, toby and myself
simultaneously renounced the design which had lured us thus
far--perceiving in each otherâ€™s countenances that desponding expression
which speaks more eloquently than words.

together we stood towards the close of this weary day in the cavity of
the third gorge we had entered, wholly incapacitated for any further
exertion, until restored to some degree of strength by food and repose.

we seated ourselves upon the least uncomfortable spot we could select,
and toby produced from the b

cold of the place, we were the more solicitous to render our habitation
for the night as comfortable as we could. accordingly, in addition to
what we had already done, we plucked down all the leaves within our
reach and threw them in a heap over our little hut, into which we now
crept, raking after us a reserved supply to form our couch.

that night nothing but the pain i suffered prevented me from sleeping
most refreshingly. as it was, i caught two or three naps, while toby
slept away at my side as soundly as though he had been sandwiched
between two holland sheets. luckily it did not rain, and we were
preserved from the misery which a heavy shower would have occasioned
us. in the morning i was awakened by the sonorous voice of my companion
ringing in my ears and bidding me rise. i crawled out from our heap of
leaves, and was astonished at the change which a good nightâ€™s rest had
wrought in his appearance. he was as blithe and joyous as a young bird,
and was sta

calling upon him good-humouredly to speed our banquet, i prepared myself
for it by washing in the stream. this operation concluded, we swallowed,
or rather absorbed, by a peculiar kind of slow sucking process, our
respective morsels of nourishment, and then entered into a discussion as
to the steps is was necessary for us to pursue.

â€˜whatâ€™s to be done now?â€™ inquired i, rather dolefully.

â€˜descend into that same valley we descried yesterday.â€™ rejoined toby,
with a rapidity and loudness of utterance that almost led me to suspect
he had been slyly devouring the broadside of an ox in some of the
adjoining thickets. â€˜what else,â€™ he continued, â€˜remains for us to do but
that, to be sure? why, we shall both starve to a certainty if we remain
here; and as to your fears of those typees--depend upon it, it is all
nonsense.â€™

â€˜it is impossible that the inhabitants of such a lovely place as we
saw can be anything else but good fellows; and if you c

â€˜and who is to pilot us thither,â€™ i asked, â€˜even if we should decide
upon the measure you propose? are we to go again up and down those
precipices that we crossed yesterday, until we reach the place we
started from, and then take a flying leap from the cliffs to the
valley?â€™

â€˜faith, i didnâ€™t think of that,â€™ said toby; â€˜sure enough, both sides of
the valley appeared to be hemmed in by precipices, didnâ€™t they?â€™

â€˜yes,â€™ answered i, â€˜as steep as the sides of a line-of-battle ship,
and about a hundred times as high.â€™ my companion sank his head upon his
breast, and remained for a while in deep thought. suddenly he sprang to
his feet, while his eyes lighted up with that gleam of intelligence that
marks the presence of some bright idea.

â€˜yes, yes,â€™ he exclaimed; â€˜the streams all run in the same

and must necessarily flow into the valley before they reach the sea; all
we have to do is just to follow this stream, and sooner or later it will
lead us into the vale.â€™

â€˜you are right, toby,â€™ i exclaimed, â€˜you are right; it must conduct us
thither, and quickly too; for, see with what a steep inclination the
water descends.â€™

â€˜it does, indeed,â€™ burst forth my companion, overjoyed at my
verification of his theory, â€˜it does indeed; why, it is as plain as a
pike-staff. let us proceed at once; come, throw away all those stupid
ideas about the typees, and hurrah for the lovely valley of the
happars.â€™

â€˜you will have it to be happar, i see, my dear fellow; pray heaven you

may not find yourself deceived,â€™ observed i, with a shake of my head.

â€˜amen to all that, and much more,â€™ shouted toby, rushing forward; â€˜but

valley--such forests of bread-fruit trees--such groves of cocoanut--such
wilderness of guava-bushes! ah! shipmate! donâ€™t linger behind: in the
name of all delightful fruits, i am dying to be at them. come on, come
on; shove ahead, thereâ€™s a lively lad; never mind the rocks; kick them

few minutes, however, the exuberance of his spirits abated, and, pausing
for a while, he permitted me to overtake him.



chapter nine

perilous passage of the ravine--descent into the valley

the fearless confidence of toby was contagious, and i began to adopt the
happar side of the question. i could not, however, overcome a certain
feeling of trepidation as we made our way along these gloomy solitudes.
our progress, at first comparatively easy, became more and more
difficult. the bed of the watercourse was covered with fragments of
broken rocks, which had fallen from above, offering so many obstructions
to the course of the rapid stream, which vexed and fretted about
them,--forming at intervals small waterfalls,

t with great impediments than those we here
encountered. but we struggled against them manfully, well knowing our
only hope lay in advancing.

towards sunset we halted at a spot where we made preparations for
passing the night. here we constructed a hut, in much the same way as
before, and crawling into it, endeavoured to forget our sufferings. my
companion, i believe, slept pretty soundly; but at day break, when we
rolled out of our dwelling, i felt nearly disqualified for any further
efforts. toby prescribed as a remedy for my illness the contents of one
of our little silk packages, to be taken at once in a single dose. to
this species of medical treatment, however, i would by no means accede,
much as he insisted upon it; and so we partook of our usual morsel, and
silently resumed our journey. it was now the fourth day since we left
nukuheva, and the gnawings of hunger became painfully acute. we were
fain to pacify them by chewing the tender bark of roots and twigs,
which, if they did no

 falling waters, which we had faintly
caught in the early morning, became more distinct; and it was not long
before we were arrested by a rocky precipice of nearly a hundred feet
in depth, that extended all across the channel, and over which the wild
stream poured in an unbroken leap. on each hand the walls of the
ravine presented their overhanging sides both above and below the fall,
affording no means whatever of avoiding the cataract by taking a circuit
round it.

â€˜whatâ€™s to be done now, toby?â€™ said i.

â€˜why,â€™ rejoined he, â€˜as we cannot retreat, i suppose we must keep
shoving along.â€™

â€˜very true, my dear toby; but how do you purpose accomplishing that
desirable object?â€™

â€˜by jumping from the top of the fall, if there be no other way,â€™
unhesitatingly replied my companion: â€˜it will be much the quickest way
of descent; but as you are not quite as active as i am, we will try some
other way.â€™

and, so saying, he crept cautiously along and peered over into the
abyss,

 while i remained wondering by what possible means we could
overcome this apparently insuperable obstruction. as soon as my
companion had completed his survey, i eagerly inquired the result.

â€˜the result of my observations you wish to know, do you?â€™ began toby,
deliberately, with one of his odd looks: â€˜well, my lad, the result of my
observations is very quickly imparted. it is at present uncertain which
of our two necks will have the honour to be broken first; but about a
hundred to one would be a fair bet in favour of the man who takes the
first jump.â€™

â€˜then it is an impossible thing, is it?â€™ inquired i gloomily.

â€˜no, shipmate; on the contrary, it is the easiest thing in life: the
only awkward point is the sort of usage which our unhappy

ome three or four inches in thickness, and
several feet long, which, after twisting among the fissures of the rock,
shot perpendicularly from it and ran tapering to a point in the air,
hanging over the gulf like so many dark icicles. they covered nearly
the entire surface of one side of the gorge, the lowest of them
reaching even to the water. many were moss grown and decayed, with their
extremities snapped short off, and those in the immediate vicinity of
the fall were slippery with moisture.

tobyâ€™s scheme, and it was a desperate one, was to entrust ourselves
to these treacherous-looking roots, and by slipping down from one to
another to gain the bottom.

â€˜are you ready to venture it?â€™ asked toby, looking at me earnestly but
without saying a word as to the practicability of the plan.

â€˜i am,â€™ was my reply; for i saw it was our only resource if we wished to
advance, and as for retreating, all thoughts of that sort had been long
abandoned.

after i had signified my assent, toby,

against the side of the rock, and
at the instant that i approached the large root caught desperately at
it, and transferred myself to it. it vibrated violently under the sudden
weight, but fortunately did not give way.

my brain grew dizzy with the idea of the frightful risk i had just run,
and i involuntarily closed my eyes to shut out the view of the
depth beneath me. for the instant i was safe, and i uttered a devout
ejaculation of thanksgiving for my escape.

â€˜pretty well done,â€™ shouted toby underneath me; â€˜you are nimbler than
i thought you to be--hopping about up there from root to root like any
young squirrel. as soon as you have diverted yourself sufficiently, i
would advise you to proceed.â€™

â€˜aye, aye, toby, all in good time: two or three more such famous roots
as this, and i shall be with you.â€™

the residue of my downward progress was comparatively easy; the roots
were in greater abundance, and in one or two places jutting out points
of rock assisted me greatly. in a

few moments i was standing by the side
of my companion.

substituting a stout stick for the one i had thrown aside at the top of
the precipice, we now continued our course along the bed of the ravine.
soon we were saluted by a sound in advance, that grew by degrees
louder and louder, as the noise of the cataract we were leaving behind
gradually died on our ears.

â€˜another precipice for us, toby.â€™

â€˜very good; we can descend them, you know--come on.â€™

nothing indeed appeared to depress or intimidate this intrepid fellow.
typees or niagaras, he was as ready to engage one as the other, and i
could not avoid a thousand times congratulating myself upon having such
a companion in an enterprise like the present.

after an hourâ€™s painful progress, we reached the verge of another fall,
still loftier than the preceding and flanked both above and below with
the same steep masses of rock,

 presenting, however, here and there
narrow irregular ledges, supporting a shallow soil, on which grew a
variety of bushes and trees, whose bright verdure contrasted beautifully
with the foamy waters that flowed between them.

toby, who invariably acted as pioneer, now proceeded to reconnoitre.
on his return, he reported that the shelves of rock on our right
would enable us to gain with little risk the bottom of the cataract.
accordingly, leaving the bed of the stream at the very point where it
thundered down, we began crawling along one of those sloping ledges
until it carried us to within a few feet of another that inclined
downwards at a still sharper angle, and upon which, by assisting each
other we managed to alight 
 
 ___________________________
 
in safety. we warily crept along this,
steadying ourselves by the naked roots of the shrubs that clung to every
fissure. as we proceeded, the narrow path became still more contracted,
rendering it difficult for us to maintain our footing, until suddenly,
as we reached an angle of the wall of rock where we had expected it to
widen, we perceived to our consternation that a yard or two further on
it abruptly terminated at a place we could not possibly hope to pass.

toby as usual led the van, and in silence i waited to learn from him how
he proposed to extricate us from this new difficulty.

â€˜well, my boy,â€™ i exclaimed, after the expiration of several minutes,
during which time my companion had not uttered a word, â€˜whatâ€™s to be
done now?â€™

he replied in a tranquil tone, that probably the best thing we could do
in our present strait was to get out of it as soon as possible.

â€˜yes, my dear toby, but tell me how we are to get out of it.â€™

her alternative!â€™ and with this he ducked beneath the foliage, and
slipping down the trunk, stood in a moment at least fifty feet beneath
me, upon the broad shelf of rock from which sprung the tree he had
descended.

what would i not have given at that moment to have been by his side. the
feat he had just accomplished seemed little less than miraculous, and
i could hardly credit the evidence of my senses when i saw the wide
distance that a single daring act had so suddenly placed between us.

tobyâ€™s animating â€˜come onâ€™ again sounded in my ears, and dreading to
lose all confidence in myself if i remained meditating upon the step,
i once more gazed down to assure myself of the relative bearing of the
tree and my own position, and then closing my eyes and uttering one
comprehensive ejaculation of prayer, i inclined myself over towards the
abyss, and after one breathless instant fell with a crash into the tree,
the branches snapping and cracking with my weight, as i sunk lower and

d deemed
it advisable to enter the valley, we ought manfully to face the
consequences, whatever they might be; the more especially as i was
convinced there was no alternative left us but to fall in with the
natives at once, and boldly risk the reception they might give us; and
that as to myself, i felt the necessity of rest and shelter, and that
until i had obtained them, i should be wholly unable to encounter such
sufferings as we had lately passed through. to the justice of these
observations toby somewhat reluctantly assented.

we were surprised that, after moving as far as we had along the valley,
we should still meet with the same impervious thickets; and thinking,
that although the borders of the stream might be lined for some distance
with them, yet beyond there might be more open ground, i requested toby
to keep a bright look-out upon one side, while i did the same on the
other, in order to discover some opening in the bushes, and especially
to watch for the slightest appearance of

ded, ignorant at what moment we might
be greeted by the javelin of some ambushed savage. at last my companion
paused, and directed my attention to a narrow opening in the foliage. we
struck into it, and it soon brought us by an indistinctly traced path to
a comparatively clear space, at the further end of which we descried
a number of the trees, the native name of which is â€˜annueeâ€™, and which
bear a most delicious fruit. what a race! i hobbling over the ground
like some decrepid wretch, and toby leaping forward like a greyhound. he
quickly cleared one of the trees on which there were two or three of
the fruit, but to our chagrin they proved to be much decayed; the rinds
partly opened by the birds, and their hearts half devoured. however, we
quickly despatched them, and no ambrosia could have been more delicious.

we looked about us uncertain whither to direct our steps, since the path
we had so far followed appeared to be lost in the open space around us.
at last we resolved to enter a

 grove near at hand, and had advanced a
few rods, when, just upon its skirts, i picked up a slender bread-fruit
shoot perfectly green, and with the tender bark freshly stripped from
it. it was still slippery with moisture, and appeared as if it had been
but that moment thrown aside. i said nothing, but merely held it up to
toby, who started at this undeniable evidence of the vicinity of the
savages.

the plot was now thickening.--a short distance further lay a little
faggot of the same shoots bound together with a strip of bark. could it
have been thrown down by some solitary native, who, alarmed at seeing
us, had hurried forward to carry the tidings of our approach to his
countrymen?--typee or happar?--but it was too late to recede, so we
moved on slowly, my companion in advance casting eager glances under the
trees

roached him and caught a
glimpse of two figures partly hidden by the dense foliage; they were
standing close together, and were perfectly motionless. they must have
previously perceived us, and withdrawn into the depths of the wood to
elude our observation.

my mind was at once made up. dropping my staff, and tearing open the
package of things we had brought from the ship, i unrolled the cotton
cloth, and holding it in one hand picked with the other a twig from the
bushes beside me, and telling toby to follow my example, i broke through
the covert and advanced, waving the branch in token of peace towards
the shrinking forms before me. they were a boy and a girl, slender and
graceful, and completely naked, with the exception of a slight girdle of
bark, from which depended at opposite points two of the russet leaves of
the bread-fruit tree. an arm of the boy, half screened from sight by
her wild tresses, was thrown about the neck of the girl, while with the
other he held one of her hands in

with one hand, and holding the bough with the other, while they slowly
retreated. at last they suffered us to approach so near to them that we
were enabled to throw the cotton cloth across their shoulders, giving
them to understand that it was theirs, and by a variety of gestures
endeavouring to make them understand that we entertained the highest
possible regard for them.

the frightened pair now stood still, whilst we endeavoured to make them
comprehend the nature of our wants. in doing this toby went through with
a complete series of pantomimic illustrations--opening his mouth from
ear to ear, and thrusting his fingers down his throat, gnashing his
teeth and rolling his eyes about, till i verily believe the poor
creatures took us for a couple of white cannibals who were about to
make a meal of them. when, however, they understood us, they showed
no inclination to relieve our wants. at this juncture it began to rain
violently, and we motioned them to lead us to some place of shelter.
wi

th this request they appeared willing to comply, but nothing could
evince more strongly the apprehension with which they regarded us,
than the way in which, whilst walking before us, they kept their eyes
constantly turned back to watch every movement we made, and even our
very looks.

â€˜typee or happar, toby?â€™ asked i as we walked after them.

â€˜of course happar,â€™ he replied, with a show of confidence which was
intended to disguise his doubts.

â€˜we shall soon know,â€™ i exclaimed; and at the same moment i
stepped forward towards our guides, and pronouncing the two names
interrogatively and pointing to the lowest part of the valley,
endeavoured to come to the point at once. they repeated the words after
me again and again, but without giving any peculiar emphasis to either,
so that i was comp

rds found them to have been on this
particular occasion never probably fell in any travellerâ€™s way.

more and more curious to ascertain our fate, i now threw together in the
form of a question the words â€˜happarâ€™ and â€˜motarkeeâ€™, the latter being
equivalent to the word â€˜goodâ€™. the two natives interchanged glances
of peculiar meaning with one another at this, and manifested no little
surprise; but on the repetition of the question after some consultation
together, to the great joy of toby, they answered in the affirmative.
toby was now in ecstasies, especially as the young savages continued
to reiterate their answer with great energy, as though desirous of
impressing us with the idea that being among the happars, we ought to
consider ourselves perfectly secure.

although i had some lingering doubts, i feigned great delight with toby
at this announcement, while my companion broke out into a pantomimic
abhorrence of typee, and immeasurable love for the particular valley in
which w

ffered it to him. he quietly rejected the proffered gift, and, without
speaking, motioned me to return it to its place.

in my previous intercourse with the natives of nukuheva and tior, i had
found that the present of a small piece of tobacco would have rendered
any of them devoted to my service. was this act of the chief a token of
his enmity? typee or happar? i asked within myself. i started, for at
the same moment this identical question was asked by the strange being
before me. i turned to toby, the flickering light of a native taper
showed me his countenance pale with trepidation at this fatal question.
i paused for a second, and i know not by what impulse it was that i
answered â€˜typeeâ€™. the piece of dusky statuary nodded in approval, and
then murmured â€˜motarkee!â€™ â€˜motarkee,â€™ said i, without further hesitation
â€˜typee motarkee.â€™

what a transition! the dark figures around us leaped to their feet,
clapped their hands in transport, and shouted again and again the
talisma

ounce my real name, and then with
the most praiseworthy intentions intimated that i was known as â€˜tomâ€™.
but i could not have made a worse selection; the chief could not master
it. â€˜tommo,â€™ â€˜tommaâ€™, â€˜tommeeâ€™, everything but plain â€˜tomâ€™. as he
persisted in garnishing the word with an additional syllable, i
compromised the matter with him at the word â€˜tommoâ€™; and by that name
i went during the entire period of my stay in the valley. the same
proceeding was gone through with toby, whose mellifluous appellation was
more easily caught.

an exchange of names is equivalent to a ratification of good will and
amity among these simple people; and as we were aware of this fact, we
were delighted that it had taken place on the present occasion.

reclining upon our mats, we now held a kind of levee, giving audience
to successive troops of the natives, who introduced themselves to us by
pronouncing their respective names, and retired in high good humour on
receiving ours in return

to discuss. i
eyed it wistfully for a moment, and then, unable any longer to stand on
ceremony, plunged my hand into the yielding mass, and to the boisterous
mirth of the natives drew it forth laden with the poee-poee, which
adhered in lengthy strings to every finger. so stubborn was its
consistency, that in conveying my heavily-weighted hand to my mouth, the
connecting links almost raised the calabash from the mats on which it
had been placed. this display of awkwardness--in which, by-the-bye, toby
kept me company--convulsed the bystanders with uncontrollable laughter.

as soon as their merriment had somewhat subsided, mehevi, motioning us
to be attentive, dipped the forefinger of his right hand in the dish,
and giving it a rapid and scientific twirl, drew it out coated smoothly
with the preparation. with a second peculiar flourish he prevented the
poee-poee from dropping to the ground as he raised it to his mouth, into
which the finger was inserted and drawn forth perfectly free from any

adhesive matter.

this performance was evidently intended for our instruction; so i
again essayed the feat on the principles inculcated, but with very ill
success.

a starving man, however, little heeds conventional proprieties,
especially on a south-sea island, and accordingly toby and i partook of
the dish after our own clumsy fashion, beplastering our faces all over
with the glutinous compound, and daubing our hands nearly to the
wrist. this kind of food is by no means disagreeable to the palate of a
european, though at first the mode of eating it may be. for my own
part, after the lapse of a few days i became accustomed to its singular
flavour, and grew remarkably fond of it.

so much for the first course; several other dishes followed it, some of
which were positively

chapter eleven

midnight reflections--morning visitors--a warrior in costume--a savage
aesculapius--practice of the healing art--body servant--a dwelling-house
of the valley described--portraits of its inmates

various and conflicting were the thoughts which oppressed me during the
silent hours that followed the events related in the preceding chapter.
toby, wearied with the fatigues of the day, slumbered heavily by my
side; but the pain under which i was suffering effectually prevented
my sleeping, and i remained distressingly alive to all the fearful
circumstances of our present situation. was it possible that, after all
our vicissitudes, we were really in the terrible valley of typee, and
at the mercy of its inmates, a fierce and unrelenting tribe of savages?
typee or happar? i shuddered when i reflected that there was no longer
any room for do
 
 ___________________________
 
whom i so greatly dreaded!

from the excitement of these fearful thoughts i sank towards morning
into an uneasy slumber; and on awaking, with a start, in the midst of an
appalling dream, looked up into the eager countenance of a number of the
natives, who were bending over me.

it was broad day; and the house was nearly filled with young females,
fancifully decorated with flowers, who gazed upon me as i rose with
faces in which childish delight and curiosity were vividly portrayed.
after waking toby, they seated themselves round us on the mats, and gave
full play to that prying inquisitiveness which time out of mind has been
attributed to the adorable sex.

as these unsophisticated young creatures were attended by no jealous
duennas, their proceedings were altogether informal, and void of
artificial restraint. long and minute was the investigation with which
they honoured us, and so uproarious their mirth, that i felt infinitely
sheepish; and toby was immeasurably outraged at their familia

the warrior, from the excellence of his physical proportions, might
certainly have been regarded as one of natureâ€™s noblemen, and the lines
drawn upon his face may possibly have denoted his exalted rank.

this warlike personage, upon entering the house, seated himself at some
distance from the spot where toby and myself reposed, while the rest of
the savages looked alternately from us to him, as if in expectation of
something they were disappointed in not perceiving. regarding the chief
attentively, i thought his lineaments appeared familiar to me. as
soon as his full face was turned upon me, and i again beheld its
extraordinary embellishment, and met the strange gaze to which i had
been subjected the preceding night, i immediately, in spite of the
alteration in his appearance, recognized the noble

wand with which a theatrical magician appears on the stage, and in
one hand he carried a freshly plaited fan of the green leaflets of the
cocoanut tree. a flowing robe of tappa, knotted over the shoulder, hung
loosely round his stooping form, and heightened the venerableness of his
aspect.

mehevi, saluting this old gentleman, motioned him to a seat between us,
and then uncovering my limb, desired him to examine it. the leech
gazed intently from me to toby, and then proceeded to business. after
diligently observing the ailing member, he commenced manipulating it;
and on the supposition probably that the complaint had deprived the leg
of all sensation, began to pinch and hammer it in such a manner that i
absolutely roared with pain. thinking that i was as capable of making
an application of thumps and pinches to the part as any one else, i
endeavoured to resist this species of medical treatment. but it was
not so easy a matter to get out of the cl

he unfortunate limb as if it were something for which he
had been long seeking, and muttering some kind of incantation continued
his discipline, pounding it after a fashion that set me well nigh crazy;
while mehevi, upon the same principle which prompts an affectionate
mother to hold a struggling child in a dentistâ€™s chair, restrained me
in his powerful grasp, and actually encouraged the wretch in this
infliction of torture.

almost frantic with rage and pain, i yelled like a bedlamite; while
toby, throwing himself into all the attitudes of a posture-master,
vainly endeavoured to expostulate with the natives by signs and
gestures. to have looked at my companion, as, sympathizing with my
sufferings, he strove to put an end to them, one would have thought
that he was the deaf and dumb alphabet incarnated. whether my tormentor
yielded to tobyâ€™s entreaties, or paused from sheer exhaustion, i do not
know; but all at once he ceased his operations, and at the same time the

case.

i could not but be amused at the manner in which the chief addressed me
upon this occasion, talking to me for at least fifteen or twenty minutes
as calmly as if i could understand every word that he said. i remarked
this peculiarity very often afterwards in many other of the islanders.

mehevi having now departed, and the family physician having likewise
made his exit, we were left about sunset with ten or twelve natives, who
by this time i had ascertained composed the household of which toby and
i were members. as the dwelling to which we had been first introduced
was the place of my permanent abode while i remained in the valley,
and as i was necessarily placed upon the most intimate footing with its
occupants, i may as well here enter into a little description of it
and its inhabitants. this description will apply also to nearly all the
other dwelling-places in the vale, and will furnish some idea of the
generality of the natives.

. to this procedure i, of
course, most earnestly objected, but in vain; and having laid a calabash
of kokoo before me, he washed his fingers in a vessel of water, and then
putting his hands into the dish and rolling the food into little balls,
put them one after another into my mouth. all my remonstrances against
this measure only provoked so great a clamour on his part, that i
was obliged to acquiesce; and the operation of feeding being thus
facilitated, the meal was quickly despatched. as for toby, he was
allowed to help himself after his own fashion.

the repast over, my attendant arranged the mats for repose, and, bidding
me lie down, covered me with a large robe of tappa, at the same time
looking approvingly upon me, and exclaiming â€˜ki-ki, nuee nuee, ah! moee
moee motarkeeâ€™ (eat plenty, ah! sleep very good). the philosophy of
this sentiment i did not pretend to question; for deprived of sleep for
several preceding nights, and the pain of my limb having much abated, i

forth at every frolicsome incident. on the afternoon of the day that i
took my first bath in the valley, we received another visit from mehevi.
the noble savage seemed to be in the same pleasant mood, and was quite
as cordial in his manner as before. after remaining about an hour, he
rose from the mats, and motioning to leave the house, invited toby and
myself to accompany him. i pointed to my leg; but mehevi in his turn
pointed to kory-kory, and removed that objection; so, mounting upon the
faithful fellowâ€™s shoulders again--like the old man of the sea astride
of sindbad--i followed after the chief.

the nature of the route we now pursued struck me more forcibly than
anything i had yet seen, as illustrating the indolent disposition of
the islanders. the path was obviously the most beaten one in the
valley, several others leading from ea

imaginary pollution of a womanâ€™s presence.

on entering the house, i was surprised to see six muskets ranged against
the bamboo on one side, from the barrels of which depended as many small
canvas pouches, partly filled with powder.

disposed about these muskets, like the cutlasses that decorate the
bulkhead of a man-of-warâ€™s cabin, were a great variety of rude spears
and paddles, javelins, and war-clubs. this then, said i to toby, must be
the armoury of the tribe.

as we advanced further along the building, we were struck with the
aspect of four or five hideous old wretches, on whose decrepit forms
time and tattooing seemed to have obliterated every trace of humanity.
owing to the continued operation of this latter process, which only
terminates among the warriors of the island after all the figures
stretched upon their limbs in youth have been blended together--an
effect, however, produced only in cases of extreme long

the repast concluded, a pipe was lighted, which passed from mouth to
mouth, and yielding to its soporific influence, the quiet of the place,
and the deepening shadows of approaching night, my companion and i sank
into a kind of drowsy repose, while the chief and kory-kory seemed to be
slumbering beside us.

i awoke from an uneasy nap, about midnight, as i supposed; and, raising
myself partly from the mat, became sensible that we were enveloped
in utter darkness. toby lay still asleep, but our late companions had
disappeared. the only sound that interrupted the silence of the place
was the asthmatic breathing of the old men i have mentioned, who reposed
at a little distance from us. besides them, as well as i could judge,
there was no one else in the house.

apprehensive of some evil, i roused my comrade, and we were engaged in a
whispered conference concerning the unexpected withdrawal of the natives
when all at once, from the depths of the grove, in full v

iew of us
where we lay, shoots of flame were seen to rise, and in a few moments
illuminated the surrounding trees, casting, by contrast, into still
deeper gloom the darkness around us.

while we continued gazing at this sight, dark figures appeared moving
to and fro before the flames; while others, dancing and capering about,
looked like so many demons.

regarding this new phenomenon with no small degree of trepidation, i
said to my companion, â€˜what can all this mean, toby?â€™

â€˜oh, nothing,â€™ replied he; â€˜getting the fire ready, i suppose.â€™

â€˜fire!â€™ exclaimed i, while my heart took to beating like a trip-hammer,
â€˜what fire?â€™

â€˜why, the fire to cook us, to be sure, what else would the cannibals be
kicking up such a row about if it were not for that?â€™

â€˜oh, toby! have done with your jokes; this is no time for them;
something is about to happen, i feel confident.â€™

â€˜jokes, indeed?â€™ exclaimed toby indignantly. â€˜did you ever hear me joke?

kory-kory there!--has he not been stuffing you with his confounded
mushes, just in the way they treat swine before they kill them? depend
upon it, we will be eaten this blessed night, and there is the fire we
shall be roasted by.â€™

this view of the matter was not at all calculated to allay my
apprehensions, and i shuddered when i reflected that we were indeed at
the mercy of a tribe of cannibals, and that the dreadful contingency
to which toby had alluded was by no means removed beyond the bounds of
possibility.

â€˜there! i told you so! they are coming for us!â€™ exclaimed my companion
the next moment, as the forms of four of the islanders were seen in
bold relief against the illuminated back-ground mounting the pi-pi and
approaching towards us.

they came on noiselessly, nay stealthily, and glided along through the
gloom that surrounded us as if about to spring upon some object they
were fearful of disturbing before they should mak

e sure of it.--gracious
heaven! the horrible reflections which crowded upon me that moment.--a
cold sweat stood upon my brow, and spell-bound with terror i awaited my
fate!

suddenly the silence was broken by the well-remembered tones of mehevi,
and at the kindly accents of his voice my fears were immediately
dissipated. â€˜tommo, toby, ki ki!â€™ (eat). he had waited to address us,
until he had assured himself that we were both awake, at which he seemed
somewhat surprised.

â€˜ki ki! is it?â€™ said toby in his gruff tones; â€˜well, cook us first, will
you--but whatâ€™s this?â€™ he added, as another savage appeared, bearing
before him a large trencher of wood containing some kind of steaming
meat, as appeared from the odours it diffused, and which he deposited at
the feet of mehevi. â€˜a baked baby, i dare say i but i will hav

if they serve me up, they are welcome! but i say, tommo, you are not
going to eat any of that mess there, in the dark, are you? why, how can
you tell what it is?â€™

â€˜by tasting it, to be sure,â€™ said i, masticating a morsel that kory-kory
had just put in my mouth, â€˜and excellently good it is, too, very much
like veal.â€™

â€˜a baked baby, by the soul of captain cook!â€™ burst forth toby, with
amazing vehemence; â€˜veal? why there never was a calf on the island
till you landed. i tell you you are bolting down mouthfuls from a dead
happarâ€™s carcass, as sure as you live, and no mistake!â€™

emetics and lukewarm water! what a sensation in the abdominal region!
sure enough, where could the fiends incarnate have obtained meat? but i
resolved to satisfy myself at all hazards; and turning to mehevi, i soon
made the ready chief understand that i wished a light to be brought.
when the

 taper came, i gazed eagerly into the vessel, and recognized the
mutilated remains of a juvenile porker! â€˜puarkee!â€™ exclaimed kory-kory,
looking complacently at the dish; and from that day to this i have never
forgotten that such is the designation of a pig in the typee lingo.

the next morning, after being again abundantly feasted by the hospitable
mehevi, toby and myself arose to depart. but the chief requested us to
postpone our intention. â€˜abo, aboâ€™ (wait, wait), he said and accordingly
we resumed our seats, while, assisted by the zealous kory-kory, he
appeared to be engaged in giving directions to a number of the natives
outside, who were busily employed in making arrangements, the nature
of which we could not comprehend. but we were not left long in our
ignorance, for a few moments only had elapsed, when the chief beckoned
us to approach, and

us with shouts
of merriment and delight, which almost drowned the deep notes of the
recitative. on approaching old marheyoâ€™s domicile, its inmates rushed
out to receive us; and while the gifts of mehevi were being disposed of,
the superannuated warrior did the honours of his mansion with all the
warmth of hospitality evinced by an english squire when he regales his
friends at some fine old patrimonial mansion.



chapter thirteen

attempt to procure relief from nukuheva--perilous adventure of toby in
the happar mountains--eloquence of kory-kory

amidst these novel scenes a week passed away almost imperceptibly. the
natives, actuated by some mysterious impulse, day after day redoubled
their attentions to us. their manner towards us was unaccountable.
surely, thought i, they would not act thus if they meant us any harm.
but why this excess of deferential kindness, or what equivalent can they
imagine us capable of rendering them for it?

we were fairly puzzled. but despite the apprehensions
 
 ___________________________
 
 i could not
dispel, the horrible character imputed to these typees appeared to be
wholly undeserved.

â€˜why, they are cannibals!â€™ said toby on one occasion when i eulogized
the tribe. â€˜granted,â€™ i replied, â€˜but a more humane, gentlemanly and
amiable set of epicures do not probably exist in the pacific.â€™

but, notwithstanding the kind treatment we received, i was too familiar
with the fickle disposition of savages not to feel anxious to withdraw
from the valley, and put myself beyond the reach of that fearful death
which, under all these smiling appearances, might yet menace us. but
here there was an obstacle in the way of d

to grow worse and worse. their mild applications, though they soothed
the pain, did not remove the disorder, and i felt convinced that without
better aid i might anticipate long and acute suffering.

but how was this aid to be procured? from the surgeons of the french
fleet, which probably still lay in the bay of nukuheva, it might easily
have been obtained, could i have made my case known to them. but how
could that be effected?

at last, in the exigency to which i was reduced, i proposed to toby that
he should endeavour to go round to nukuheva, and if he could not
succeed in returning to the valley by water, in one of the boats of the
squadron, and taking me off, he might at least procure me some proper
medicines, and effect his return overland.

my companion listened to me in silence, and at first did not appear to
relish the idea. the truth was, he felt impatient to escape from the
place, and wished to avail himself of our present high favour with
the natives to make good our retreat

 of again returning to this
dangerous place; and as for the expectation of persuading the frenchmen
to detach a boatâ€™s crew for the purpose of rescuing me from the typees,
he looked upon it as idle; and with arguments that i could not answer,
urged the improbability of their provoking the hostilities of the clan
by any such measure; especially, as for the purpose of quieting its
apprehensions, they had as yet refrained from making any visit to the
bay. â€˜and even should they consent,â€™ said toby, â€˜they would only produce
a commotion in the valley, in which we might both be sacrificed by these
ferocious islanders.â€™ this was unanswerable; but still i clung to the
belief that he might succeed in accomplishing the other part of my plan;
and at last i overcame his scruples, and he agreed to make the attempt.

as soon as we succeeded in making the natives understand our intention,
they broke out into the most vehement opposition to the measure, and
for a while i almost despaired of obtai

ory, in particular, was
unbounded; he threw himself into a perfect paroxysm of gestures which
were intended to convey to us not only his abhorrence of nukuheva
and its uncivilized inhabitants, but also his astonishment that after
becoming acquainted with the enlightened typees, we should evince the
least desire to withdraw, even for a time, from their agreeable society.

however, i overbore his objections by appealing to my lameness; from
which i assured the natives i should speedily recover if toby were
permitted to obtain the supplies i needed.

it was agreed that on the following morning my companion should depart,
accompanied by some one or two of the household, who should point out to
him an easy route, by which the bay might be reached before sunset.

at early dawn of the next day, our habitation was astir. one of the
young men mounted into an adjoining cocoanut tree, and threw down a
number of the young fruit, which old marheyo quickly stripped of the
green husks, and strung togethe

r upon a short pole. these were intended
to refresh toby on his route.

the preparations being completed, with no little emotion i bade my
companion adieu. he promised to return in three days at farthest; and,
bidding me keep up my spirits in the interval, turned round the corner
of the pi-pi, and, under the guidance of the venerable marheyo, was
soon out of sight. his departure oppressed me with melancholy, and,
re-entering the dwelling, i threw myself almost in despair upon the
matting of the floor.

in two hoursâ€™ time the old warrior returned, a

habitation.

the sounds grew louder and nearer, and gradually the whole valley rang
with wild outcries. the sleepers around me started to their feet in
alarm, and hurried outside to discover the cause of the commotion.
kory-kory, who had been the first to spring up, soon returned almost
breathless, and nearly frantic with the excitement under which he seemed
to be labouring. all that i could understand from him was that some
accident had happened to toby. apprehensive of some dreadful calamity,
i rushed out of the house, and caught sight of a tumultuous crowd, who,
with shrieks and lamentations, were just emerging from the grove
bearing in their arms some object, the sight of which produced all this
transport of sorrow. as they drew near, the men redoubled their
cries, while the girls, tossing their bare arms in the air, exclaimed
plaintively, â€˜awha! awha! toby mukee moee!â€™--alas! alas! toby is killed!

in a moment the crowd opened, and dis
 
 ___________________________
 
closed the apparently lifeless body
of my companion home between two men, the head hanging heavily against
the breast of the foremost. the whole face, neck, back, and bosom were
covered with blood, which still trickled slowly from a wound behind the
temple. in the midst of the greatest uproar and confusion the body was
carried into the house and laid on a mat. waving the natives off to give
room and air, i bent eagerly over toby, and, laying my hand upon the
breast, ascertained that the heart still beat. overjoyed at this, i
seized a calabash of water, and dashed its contents upon his face, then
wiping away the blood, anxiously examined the wound. it was about three
inches long, and on removing the clotted hair from about it, showed the
skull laid completely bare. immediately with my knife i cut away the
heavy locks, and bathed the part repeatedly in water.

in a few moments toby revived, and opening his eyes for a sec

eeling beside me,
now chafed his limbs gently with the palms of his hands, while a young
girl at his head kept fanning him, and i still continued to moisten his
lips and brow. soon my poor comrade showed signs of animation, and i
succeeded in making him swallow from a cocoanut shell a few mouthfuls of
water.

old tinor now appeared, holding in her hand some simples she had
gathered, the juice of which she by signs besought me to squeeze into
the wound. having done so, i thought it best to leave toby undisturbed
until he should have had time to rally his faculties. several times he
opened his lips, but fearful for his safety i enjoined silence. in the
course of two or three hours, however, he sat up, and was sufficiently
recovered to tell me what had occurred.

â€˜after leaving the house with marheyo,â€™ said toby, â€˜we struck across the
valley, and ascended the opposite heights. just beyond them, my guide
informed me, lay the valley of happar, while along their summits, and
skirting the h

anger i scarcely felt the wound i had received;
but when the chase was over i began to suffer from it. i had lost my
hat in the flight, and the run scorched my bare head. i felt faint
and giddy; but, fearful of falling to the ground beyond the reach of
assistance, i staggered on as well as i could, and at last gained the
level of the valley, and then down i sank; and i knew nothing more until
i found myself lying upon these mats, and you stooping over me with the
calabash of water.â€™

such was tobyâ€™s account of this sad affair. i afterwards learned that,
fortunately, he had fallen close to a spot where the natives go for
fuel. a party of them caught sight of him as he fell, and sounding
the alarm, had lifted him up; and after ineffectually endeavouring to
restore him at the brook, had hurried forward with him to the house.

this incident threw a dark cloud over our prospects. it reminded us that
we were hemmed in by hostile tribes, whose territories we could not hope
to pass, on our rou

their savage resentment. there appeared to be no avenue opened to our
escape but the sea, which washed the lower extremities of the vale.

our typee friends availed themselves of the recent disaster of toby to
exhort us to a due appreciation of the blessings we enjoyed among them,
contrasting their own generous reception of us with the animosity of
their neighbours. they likewise dwelt upon the cannibal propensities of
the happars, a subject which they were perfectly aware could not fail
to alarm us; while at the same time they earnestly disclaimed all
participation in so horrid a custom. nor did they omit to call upon
us to admire the natural loveliness of their own abode, and the lavish

h it was impossible not to comprehend.

as he continued his harangue, however, kory-kory, in emulation of our
more polished orators, began to launch out rather diffusely into other
branches of his subject, enlarging probably upon the moral reflections
it suggested; and proceeded in such a strain of unintelligible and
stunning gibberish, that he actually gave me the headache for the rest
of the day.

in the course of a few days toby had recovered from the effects of

than my companion however, i still continued to languish under a
complaint, the origin and nature of which we

present itself; and apprehensive that ere long we might be exposed to
some caprice on the part of the islanders, i now gave up all hopes
of recovery, and became a prey to the most gloomy thoughts. a deep
dejection fell upon me, which neither the friendly remonstrances of
my companion, the devoted attentions of kory-kory nor all the soothing
influences of fayaway could remove.

one morning as i lay on the mats in the house, plunged in melancholy
reverie, and regardless of everything around me, toby, who had left me
about an hour, returned in haste, and with great glee told me to cheer
up and be of good heart; for he believed, from what was going on among
the natives, that there were boats approaching the bay.

these tidings operated upon me like magic. the hour of our deliverance
was at hand, and starting up, i was soon convinced that something
unusual was about to occur. the word â€˜botee! botee!â€™ was vociferated in
all directions; and shouts were heard in the distance, at first
feebly

evidence of the fact--that
it was only at long intervals any such events occur.

when i thought of the length of time that might intervene before a
similar chance of escape would be presented, i bitterly lamented that
i had not the power of availing myself effectually of the present
opportunity.

from all that we could gather, it appeared that the natives were fearful
of arriving too late upon the beach, unless they made extraordinary
exertions. sick and lame as i was, i would have started with toby at
once, had not kory-kory not only refused to carry me, but manifested
the most invincible repugnance to our leaving the neighbourhood of the
house. the rest of the savages were equally opposed to our wishes, and
seemed grieved and astonished at the earnestness of my solicitations.
i clearly perceived that while my attendant avoided all appearance of
constraining my movements, he was nevertheless determined to thwart my
wishes. he seemed to me on this particular occasion, as well as often
afte

rwards, to be executing the orders of some other person with regard
to me, though at the same time feeling towards me the most lively
affection.

toby, who had made up his mind to accompany the islanders if possible,
as soon as they were in readiness to depart, and who for that reason had
refrained from showing the same anxiety that i had done, now represented
to me that it was idle for me to entertain the hope of reaching the
beach in time to profit by any opportunity that might then be presented.

â€˜do you not see,â€™ said he, â€˜the savages themselves are fearful of being
too late, and i should hurry forward myself at once did i not think

ranquil or unconcerned, you will quiet their suspicions, and i
have no doubt they will then let me go with them to the beach, supposing
that i merely go out of curiosity. should i succeed in getting down to
the boats, i will make known the condition in which i have left you, and
measures may then be taken to secure our escape.â€™

in the expediency of this i could not but acquiesce; and as the natives
had now completed their preparations, i watched with the liveliest
interest the reception that tobyâ€™s application might meet with. as soon
as they understood from my companion that i intended to remain, they
appeared to make no objection to his proposition, and even hailed it
with pleasure. their singular conduct on this occasion not a little
puzzled me at the time, and imparted to subsequent events an additional
mystery.

the islanders were now to be seen hurrying along the path which led to
the sea. i shook toby warmly by the hand, and gave him my payta hat
to shield his wounded head from

hold, i quieted
my apprehensions, and waited patiently to see him advancing in company
with the beautiful fayaway. at last, i perceived tinor coming forward,
followed by the girls and young men who usually resided in the house of
marheyo; but with them came not my comrade, and, filled with a thousand
alarms, i eagerly sought to discover the cause of his delay.

my earnest questions appeared to embarrass the natives greatly. all
their accounts were contradictory: one giving me to understand that
toby would be with me in a very short time; another that he did not know
where he was; while a third, violently inveighing, against him, assured
me that he had stolen away, and would never come back. it appeared
to me, at the time, that in making these various statements they
endeavoured to conceal from me some terrible disaster, lest the
knowledge of it should overpower me.

fearful lest some fatal calamity had overtaken him, i sought out young
fayaway, and endeavoured to learn from her, if possibl
 
 ___________________________
 
ward to our return, who were, perhaps,
never more to behold us.

in this amiable light did fayaway appear in my eyes; and reposing full
confidence in her candour and intelligence, i now had recourse to her,
in the midst of my alarm, with regard to my companion.

my questions evidently distressed her. she looked round from one to
another of the bystanders, as if hardly knowing what answer to give me.
at last, yielding to my importunities, she overcame her scruples, and
gave me to understand that toby had gone away with the boats which had
visited the bay, but had promised to return at the expiration of three
days. at first i accused him of perfidiously deserting me; but as i grew
more composed, i upbraided myself for imputing so cowardly an action
to him, and tranquillized myself with the belief that he had availed
himself, of the opportunity to go round to nukuheva, in order to make
some arrangement by which i could be removed from the valley. at any
rate, thought i, he will return with th
 
 ___________________________
 
e medicines i require, and then,
as soon as i recover, there will be no difficulty in the way of our
departure.

consoling myself with these reflections, i lay down that night in a
happier frame of mind than i had done for some time. the next day passed
without any allusion to toby on the part of the natives, who seemed
desirous of avoiding all reference to the subject. this raised some
apprehensions in my breast; but when night came, i congratulated myself
that the second day had now gone by, and that on the morrow toby would
again be with me. but the morrow came and went, and my companion did
not appear. ah! thought i, he reckons three days from the morning of his
departure,--tomorrow he will arrive. but that weary day also closed upon
me, without his return. even yet i

at last
hope deserted me, and i fell a victim to despair.

yes; thought i, gloomily, he has secured his own escape, and cares not
what calamity may befall his unfortunate comrade. fool that i was,
to suppose that any one would willingly encounter the perils of this
valley, after having once got beyond its limits! he has gone, and has
left me to combat alone all the dangers by which i am surrounded. thus
would i sometimes seek to derive a desperate consolation from dwelling
upon the perfidity of toby: whilst at other times i sunk under the
bitter remorse which i felt as having by my own imprudence brought upon
myself the fate which i was sure awaited me.

at other times i thought that perhaps after all these treacherous
savages had made away with him, and thence the confusion into which
they were thrown by my questions, and their contradictory answers, or he
might be a captive in some other part of the valley, or, more dreadful
still, might have met with that fate at which my very soul shud

dered.
but all these speculations were vain; no tidings of toby ever reached
me; he had gone never to return.

the conduct of the islanders appeared inexplicable. all reference to my
lost comrade was carefully evaded, and if at any time they were forced
to make some reply to my frequent inquiries on the subject, they would
uniformly denounce him as an ungrateful runaway, who had deserted
his friend, and taken himself off to that vile and detestable place
nukuheva.

but whatever might have been his fate, now that he was gone the natives

arheyo--shaving
the head of a warrior

in looking back to this period, and calling to remembrance the
numberless proofs of kindness and respect which i received from the
natives of the valley, i can scarcely understand how it was that, in the
midst of so many consolatory circumstances, my mind should still have
been consumed by the most dismal forebodings, and have remained a
prey to the profoundest melancholy. it is true that the suspicious
circumstances which had attended the disappearance of toby were enough
of themselves to excite distrust with regard to the savages, in whose
power i felt myself to be entirely placed, especially when it was
combined with the knowledge that these very men, kind and respectful
as they were to me, were, after all, nothing better than a set of
cannibals.

but my chief source of anxiety, and that which poisoned every temporary
enjoyment, was the mysterious disease in my leg, which still remained
unabated. all the herbal applications of tinor, united with th
 
 ___________________________
 
s was agonizing. the unaccountable malady showed no signs
of amendment: on the contrary, its violence increased day by day, and
threatened the most fatal results, unless some powerful means were
employed to counteract it. it seemed as if i were destined to sink
under this grievous affliction, or at least that it would hinder me from
availing myself of any opportunity of escaping from the valley.

an incident which occurred as nearly as i can estimate about three weeks
after the disappearance of toby, convinced me that the natives, from
some reason or other, would interpose every possible obstacle to my
leaving them.

one morning there was no little excitement evinced by the people near
my abode, and which i soon discovered proceeded from a vague report
that boats, had been seen at a great distance approaching the bay.
immediately all was bustle and animation. it so happened that day that
the pain i suffered having somewhat abated, and feeling in much better
spirits than usual, i had compli

d as being situated within the precincts of the taboo groves.
these sacred recesses were at no great distance from marheyoâ€™s
habitation, and lay between it and the sea; the path that conducted to
the beach passing directly in front of the ti, and thence skirting along
the border of the groves.

i was reposing upon the mats, within the sacred building, in company
with mehevi and several other chiefs, when the announcement was first
made. it sent a thrill of joy through my whole frame;--perhaps toby was
about to return. i rose at once to my feet, and my instinctive impulse
was to hurry down to the beach, equally regardless of the distance that
separated me from it, and of my disabled condition. as soon as mehevi
noticed the effect the intelligence had produced upon me, and the
impatience i betrayed to reach the sea, his countenance assumed that
inflexible rigidity of expression which had so awed me on the afternoon
of our arrival at the house of marheyo. as i was proceeding to leave
the ti
 
 ___________________________
 
the mats, and for the moment abandoned myself to despair.

i now perceived the natives one after the other hurrying past the ti and
pursuing the route that conducted to the sea. these savages, thought
i, will soon be holding communication with some of my own countrymen
perhaps, who with ease could restore me to liberty did they know of the
situation i was in. no language can describe the wretchedness which i
felt; and in the bitterness of my soul i imprecated a thousand curses on
the perfidious toby, who had thus abandoned me to destruction. it was in
vain that kory-kory tempted me with food, or lighted my pipe, or sought
to attract my attention by performing the uncouth antics that
had sometimes diverted me. i was fairly knocked down by this last
misfortune, which, much as i had feared it, i had never before had the
courage calmly to contemplate.

regardless of everything but my own sorrow, i remained in the ti for
several hours, until shouts proceeding at intervals from the groves
beyond

ere i usually reclined. when i desired anything from it
i merely raised my finger to a bamboo beside me, and taking hold of
the string which was there fastened, lowered the package. this was
exceedingly handy, and i took care to let the natives understand how
much i applauded the invention. of this package the chief contents were
a razor with its case, a supply of needles and thread, a pound or two of
tobacco and a few yards of bright-coloured calico.

i should have mentioned that shortly after tobyâ€™s disappearance,
perceiving the uncertainty of the time i might be obliged to remain in
the valley--if, indeed, i ever should escape from it--and considering
that my whole wardrobe consisted of a shirt and a pair of trousers, i
resolved to doff these garments at once, in order to preserve them in

had i been pierced simultaneously by three happar spears, i could not
have started more than i did at hearing these simple questions. for a
moment i was overwhelmed with astonishment, and then answered something
i know not what; but as soon as i regained my self-possession, the
thought darted through my mind that from this individual i might obtain
that information regarding toby which i suspected the natives had
purposely withheld from me. accordingly i questioned him concerning
the disappearance of my companion, but he denied all knowledge of
the matter. i then inquired from whence he had come? he replied, from
nukuheva. when i expressed my surprise, he looked at me for a moment,
as if enjoying my perplexity, and then with his strange vivacity,
exclaimed,--â€˜ah! me taboo,--me go nukuheva,--me go tior,--me go
typee,--me go everywhere,--nobody harm me,--me taboo.â€™

seen plenty
of white men before, and did not think it worth while to notice a poor
sailor. at this declaration of the exalted opinion i had formed of him,
he appeared vastly gratified, and gave me to understand that he had
purposely behaved in that manner, in order to increase my astonishment,
as soon as he should see proper to address me.

marnoo now sought to learn my version of the story as to how i came
to be an inmate of the typee valley. when i related to him the
circumstances under which toby and i had entered it, he listened
with evident interest; but as soon as i alluded to the absence, yet
unaccounted for, of my comrade, he endeavoured to change the subject, as
if it were something he desired not to agitate. it seemed, indeed, as
if everything connected with toby was destined to beget distrust and
anxiety in my bosom. notwithstanding marnooâ€™s denial of any knowledge
of his fate, i could not avoid suspecting that he was deceiving me; and
this suspicion revived those frightful ap

a. but as soon as i hinted at this, he unhesitatingly pronounced
it to be entirely impracticable; assuring me that the typees would never
consent to my leaving the valley. although what he said merely confirmed
the impression which i had before entertained, still it increased
my anxiety to escape from a captivity which, however endurable, nay,
delightful it might be in some respects, involved in its issues a fate
marked by the most frightful contingencies.

i could not conceal from my mind that toby had been treated in the same
friendly manner as i had been, and yet all their kindness terminated
with his mysterious disappearance. might not the same fate await me?--a
fate too dreadful to think of. stimulated by these considerations,
i urged anew my request to marnoo; but he only set forth in stronger
colours the impossibility of my escape, and repeated his previous
declaration that the typees would never be brought to consent to my
departure.

some of the natives present at the feast of calabashes had displayed a
few articles of european dress; disposed however, about their persons
after their own peculiar fashion. among these i perceived two pieces of
cotton-cloth which poor toby and myself had bestowed upon our youthful
guides the afternoon we entered the valley. they were evidently reserved
for gala days; and during those of the festival they rendered the young
islanders who wore them very distinguished characters. the small number
who were similarly adorned, and the great value they appeared to place
upon the most common and most trivial articles, furnished ample evidence
of the very restricted intercourse they held with vessels touching at
the island. a few cotton h

important as well as the minutest transactions of life. the savage, in
short, lives in the continual observance of its dictates, which guide
and control every action of his being.

for several days after entering the valley i had been saluted at least
fifty times in the twenty-four hours with the talismanic word â€˜tabooâ€™
shrieked in my ears, at some gross violation of its provisions, of which
i had unconsciously been guilty. the day after our arrival i happened to
hand some tobacco to toby over the head of a native who sat between
us. he started up, as if stung by an adder; while the whole company,
manifesting an equal degree of horror, simultaneously screamed out
â€˜taboo!â€™ i never again perpetrated a similar piece of ill-manners,
which, indeed, was forbidden by the canons of good breeding, as well as
by the mandates of the taboo. but it was not always so easy to perceive
wherein you had contravened the spirit of this institution. i was many
times called to order, if i may use

in the same way a pipe, which the king
had bestowed upon me, was rendered sacred in the eyes of the natives,
none of whom could i ever prevail upon to smoke from it. the bowl was
encircled by a woven band of grass, somewhat resembling those turksâ€™
heads occasionally worked in the handles of our whip-stalks.

a similar badge was once braided about my wrist by the royal hand
of mehevi himself, who, as soon as he had concluded the operation,
pronounced me â€˜tabooâ€™. this occurred shortly after tobyâ€™s disappearance;
and, were it not that from the first moment i had entered the valley
the natives had treated me with uniform kindness, i should have supposed
that their conduct afterwards was to be ascribed to the fact that i had
received this sacred investiture.

feature: to enumerate them all would be impossible. black hogs--infants

acious and condescending as before. but i had now been three months in
their valley, as nearly as i could estimate; i had grown familiar with
the narrow limits to which my wandering had been confined; and i began
bitterly to feel the state of captivity in which i was held. there
was no one with whom i could freely converse; no one to whom i could
communicate my thoughts; no one who could sympathize with my sufferings.
a thousand times i thought how much more endurable would have been my
lot had toby still been with me. but i was left alone, and the thought
was terrible to me. still, despite my griefs, i did all in my power
to appear composed and cheerful, well knowing that by manifesting any
uneasiness, or any desire to escape, i should only frustrate my object.

it was during the period i was in this unhappy frame of mind that the
painful malady under which i had been labouring--after having almost
completely subsided--began again to show itself, and with symptoms as
violent as ever. this

ubts under which i laboured. but before i had recovered from the
consternation into which i had been thrown, the fatal packages were
hoisted aloft, and once more swung over my head. the natives now
gathered round me tumultuously, and laboured to convince me that what
i had just seen were the heads of three happar warriors, who had been
slain in battle. this glaring falsehood added to my alarm, and it was
not until i reflected that i had observed the packages swinging from
their elevation before tobyâ€™s disappearance, that i could at all recover
my composure.

but although this horrible apprehension had been dispelled, i had
discovered enough to fill me, in my present state of mind, with the most
bitter reflections. it was plain that i had seen the last relic of some
unfortunate wretch, who must have been massacred on the beach by the
savages, in one of those perilous trading adventures which i have before
described.

the escape

nearly three weeks had elapsed since the second visit of marnoo, and it
must have been more than four months since i entered the valley, when
one day about noon, and whilst everything was in profound silence,
mow-mow, the one-eyed chief, suddenly appeared at the door, and leaning
towards me as i lay directly facing him, said in a low tone, â€˜toby pemi
enaâ€™ (toby has arrived here). gracious heaven! what a tumult of emotions
rushed upon me at this startling intelligence! insensible to the pain
that had before distracted me, i leaped to my feet, and called wildly
to kory-kory who was reposing by my side. the startled islanders sprang
from their mats; the news was quickly communicated to them; and the
next moment i was making my way to the ti on the back of kory-kory; and
surrounded by the excited savages.

all that i could comprehend of

rived in a boat which had just entered the bay. these tidings made
me most anxious to be carried at once to the sea, lest some untoward
circumstance should prevent our meeting; but to this they would not
consent, and continued their course towards the royal abode. as we
approached it, mehevi and several chiefs showed themselves from the
piazza, and called upon us loudly to come to them.

as soon as we had approached, i endeavoured to make them understand that
i was going down to the sea to meet toby. to this the king objected, and
motioned kory-kory to bring me into the house. it was in vain to resist;
and in a few moments i found myself within the ti, surrounded by a noisy
group engaged in discussing the recent intelligence. tobyâ€™s name was
frequently repeated, coupled with violent exclamations of astonishment.
it seemed as if they yet remained in doubt with regard to the fact of
his arrival, at at every fresh report that was brought from the shore
they betrayed the liveliest emotions.

ck of one
to another, and urging my bearer forward all the while with earnest
entreaties. as i thus hurried forward, no doubt as to the truth of the
information i had received ever crossed my mind.

i was alive only to the one overwhelming idea, that a chance of
deliverance was now afforded me, if the jealous opposition of the
savages could be overcome.

having been prohibited from approaching the sea during the whole of my
stay in the valley, i had always associated with it the idea of escape.
toby too--if indeed he had ever voluntarily deserted me--must have
effected this flight by the sea; and now that i was drawing near to
it myself, i indulged in hopes which i had never felt before. it was
evident that a boat had entered the bay, and i saw little reason to
doubt the truth of the report that it had brought my companion. every
time therefore that we gained an elevation, i looked eagerly around,
hoping to behold him. in the midst of an excited throng, who by their
violent gestures and wi

accelerate their already swift pace.

in this manner we had proceeded about four or five miles, when we were
met by a party of some twenty islanders, between whom and those who
accompanied me ensued an animated conference. impatient of the delay
occasioned by this interruption, i was beseeching the man who carried me
to proceed without his loitering companions, when kory-kory, running
to my side, informed me, in three fatal words, that the news had all
proved, false--that toby had not arrived--â€˜toby owlee pemiâ€™. heaven only
knows how, in the state of mind and body i then was, i ever sustained
the agony which this intelligence caused me; not that the news was
altogether unexpected; but i had trusted that the fact might not have
been made known until we should have arrived upon the beach. as it was,
i at once foresaw the course the savages would pursue. they had only
yielded thus far to my entreaties, that i might give a joyful welcome to
my long-lost comrade; but

t endeavoured to gain the door. instantly the passage
was blocked up by several men, who commanded me to resume my seat. the
fierce looks of the irritated savages admonished me that i could gain
nothing by force, and that it was by entreaty alone that i could hope to
compass my object.

guided by this consideration, i turned to mow-mow, the only chief
present whom i had been much in the habit of seeing, and carefully
concealing, my real design, tried to make him comprehend that i still
believed toby to have arrived on the shore, and besought him to allow me
to go forward to welcome him.

to all his repeated assertions, that my companion had not been seen,
i pretended to turn a deaf ear, while i urged my solicitations with an
eloquence of gesture which the one-eyed chief appeared unable to resist.
he seemed indeed to regard me as a forward child, to whose wishes he had
not the heart to oppose force, and whom he must consequently humour. he
spoke a few words to the natives, who at once retre

the events which ensued have already been detailed, and little more
remains to be related. on reaching the â€˜juliaâ€™ i was lifted over the
side, and my strange appearance and remarkable adventure occasioned the
liveliest interest. every attention was bestowed upon me that humanity
could suggest. but to such a state was i reduced, that three months
elapsed before i recovered my health.

the mystery which hung over the fate of my friend and companion toby has
never been cleared up. i still remain ignorant whether he succeeded in
leaving the valley, or perished at the hands of the islanders.




the story of toby

the morning my comrade left me, as related in the narrative, he was
accompanied by a large party of the natives, some of them carrying fruit
and hogs for the purposes of traffic, as the report had spread that
boats had touched at the bay.

as they proceeded through the settled parts of the valley, numbers
joined them from every side, ru

nning with animated cries from every
pathway. so excited were the whole party, that eager as toby was to gain
the beach, it was almost as much as he could do to keep up with them.
making the valley ring with their shouts, they hurried along on a swift
trot, those in advance pausing now and then, and flourishing their
weapons to urge the rest forward.

presently they came to a place where the paths crossed a bend of the
main stream of the valley. here a strange sound came through the grove
beyond, and the islanders halted. it was mow-mow, the one-eyed chief,
who had gone on before; he was st
 
 ___________________________
 
riking his heavy lance against the
hollow bough of a tree.

this was a signal of alarm;--for nothing was now heard but shouts
of â€˜happar! happar!â€™--the warriors tilting with their spears and
brandishing them in the air, and the women and boys shouting to each
other, and picking up the stones in the bed of the stream. in a moment
or two mow-mow and two or three other chiefs ran out from the grove, and
the din increased ten fold.

now, thought toby, for a fray; and being unarmed, he besought one of the
young men domiciled with marheyo for the loan of his spear. but he was
refused; the youth roguishly telling him that the weapon was very good
for him (the typee), but that a white man could fight much better with
his fists.

the merry humour of this young wag seemed to be shared by the rest, for
in spite of their warlike cries and gestures, everybody was capering
and laughing, as if it was one of the funniest things in the world to be

 ambush
in the thickets.

while my comrade was in vain trying to make out the meaning of all this,
a good number of the natives separated themselves from the rest and ran
off into the grove on one side, the others now keeping perfectly still,
as if awaiting the result. after a little while, however, mow-mow, who
stood in advance, motioned them to come on stealthily, which they did,
scarcely rustling a leaf. thus they crept along for ten or fifteen
minutes, every now and then pausing to listen.

toby by no means relished this sort of skulking; if there was going to
be a fight, he wanted it to begin at once. but all in good time,--for
just then, as they went prowling into the thickest of the wood, terrific
howls burst upon them on all sides, and volleys of darts and stones flew
across the path. not an enemy was to be seen, and what was still more
surprising, not a single man dropped, though the pebbles fell among the
leaves like hail.

there was a momentâ€™s pause, when the typees, with wild

themselves into the covert, spear in hand; nor was toby behindhand.
coming so near getting his skull broken by the stones, and animated by
an old grudge he bore the happars, he was among the first to dash at
them. as he broke his way through the underbush, trying, as he did
so, to wrest a spear from a young chief, the shouts of battle all of a
sudden ceased, and the wood was as still as death. the next moment, the
party who had left them so mysteriously rushed out from behind every
bush and tree, and united with the rest in long and merry peals of

aughter.

it was all a sham, and toby, who was quite out of breath with
excitement, was much incensed at being made a fool of.

it afterwards turned out that the whole affair had been concerted for
his particular benefit, though with what precise view it would be hard
to tell. my comrade was the more enraged at this boysâ€™ play, since it
had consumed so much time, every moment of which might be precious.
perhaps, however, it was partly intended for this very purpose; and he
was led to think so, because when the natives started aga

in, he observed
that they did not seem to be in so great a hurry as before. at last,
after they had gone some distance, toby, thinking all the while that
they never would get to the sea, two men came running towards them,
and a regular halt ensued, followed by a noisy discussion, during which
tobyâ€™s name was often repeated. all this made him more and more anxious
to learn what was going on at the beach; but it was in vain that he now
tried to push forward; the natives held him back.

in a few moments the conference ended, and many of them ran down the
path in the direction of the water, the rest surrounding toby, and
entreating him to â€˜moeeâ€™, or sit down and rest himself. as an additional
inducement, several calabashes of food, which had been brought along,
were now placed on the g

toby bridled his impatience a while, but at last sprang to his feet
and dashed forward again. he was soon overtaken nevertheless, and again
surrounded, but without further detention was then permitted to go down
to the sea.

they came out upon a bright green space between the groves and the
water, and close under the shadow of the happar mountain, where a path
was seen winding out of sight through a gorge.

no sign of a boat, however, was beheld, nothing but a tumultuous crowd
of men and women, and

some one in their midst, earnestly talking to
them. as my comrade advanced, this person came forward and proved to
be no stranger. he was an old grizzled sailor, whom toby and myself had
frequently seen in nukuheva, where he lived an easy devil-may-care life
in the household of mowanna the king, going by the name of â€˜jimmyâ€™.
in fact he was the royal favourite, and had a good deal to say in his
masterâ€™s councils. he wore a manilla hat and a sort of tappa morning
gown, sufficiently loose and negligent to show the verse of a song
tattooed upon his chest, and a variety of spirited cuts by native
artists in other parts of his body. he sported a fishing rod in hi

 other prodigy jimmy told us about was the younger son of a chief,
who, although but just turned of ten, had entered upon holy orders,
because his superstitious countrymen thought him especially intended
for the priesthood from the fact of his having a comb on his head like
a rooster. but this was not all; for still more wonderful to relate, the
boy prided himself upon his strange crest, being actually endowed with a
cockâ€™s voice, and frequently crowing over his peculiarity.

but to return to toby. the moment he saw the old rover on the beach, he
ran up to him, the natives following after, and forming a circle round
them.

after welcoming him to the shore, jimmy went on to tell him how that he
knew all about our having run away from the ship, and being among the
typees. indeed, he had been urged by mowanna to come over to the valley,
and after visiting his friends there, to bring us back with him, his
royal master being exceedingly anxious to share with him the reward
which had been held

 out for our capture. he, however, assured toby that
he had indignantly spurned the offer.

all this astonished my comrade not a little, as neither of us had
entertained the least idea that any white man ever visited the typees
sociably. but jimmy told him that such was the case nevertheless,
although he seldom came into the bay, and scarcely ever went back
from the beach. one of the priests of the valley, in some way or other
connected with an old tattooed divine in nukuheva, was a friend of his,
and through him he was â€˜tabooâ€™.

he said
 
 ___________________________
 
, moreover, that he was sometimes employed to come round to the
bay, and engage fruit for ships lying in nukuheva. in fact, he was now
on that very errand, according to his own account, having just come
across the mountains by the way of happar. by noon of the next day the
fruit would be heaped up in stacks on the beach, in readiness for the
boats which he then intended to bring into the bay.

jimmy now asked toby whether he wished to leave the island--if he did,
there was a ship in want of men lying in the other harbour, and he would
be glad to take him over, and see him on board that very day.

â€˜no,â€™ said toby, â€˜i cannot leave the island unless my comrade goes with
me. i left him up the valley because they would not let him come down.
let us go now and fetch him.â€™

â€˜but how is he to cross the mountain with us,â€™ replied jimmy, â€˜even if
we get him down to the beach? better let him stay till
 
 ___________________________
 
 tomorrow, and i
will bring him round to nukuheva in the boats.â€™

â€˜that will never do,â€™ said toby, â€˜but come along with me now, and let
us get him down here at any rate,â€™ and yielding to the impulse of the
moment, he started to hurry back into the valley. but hardly was his
back turned, when a dozen hands were laid on him, and he learned that he
could not go a step further.

it was in vain that he fought with them; they would not hear of his
stirring from the beach. cut to the heart at this unexpected repulse,
toby now conjured the sailor to go after me alone. but jimmy replied,
that in
 
 ___________________________
 
 the mood the typees then were they would not permit him so to
do, though at the same time he was not afraid of their offering him any
harm.

little did toby then think, as he afterwards had good reason to suspect,
that this very jimmy was a heartless villain, who, by his arts, had just
incited the natives to restrain him as he was in the act of going after
me. well must the old sailor have known, too, that the natives would
never consent to our leaving together, and he therefore wanted to get
toby off alone, for a purpose which he afterwards made plain. of all
this, however, my comrade now knew nothing.

he was still struggling with the islanders when jimmy again came up to
him, and warned him against irritating them, saying that he was only
making matters worse for both of us, and if they became enraged, there
was no telling what might happen. at last he made toby sit down on a
broken canoe by a pile of stones, upon which was a ruinous little shrine
supported by four upright poles, and

in front partly screened by a net.
the fishing parties met there, when they came in from the sea, for their
offerings were laid before an image, upon a smooth black stone within.
this spot jimmy said was strictly â€˜tabooâ€™, and no one would molest or
come near him while he stayed by its shadow. the old sailor then went
off, and began speaking very earnestly to mow-mow and some other chiefs,
while all the rest formed a circle round the taboo place, looking
intently at toby, and talking to each other without ceasing.

now, notwithstanding what jimmy had just told him, there presently came
up to my comrade an old woman, who seated herself beside him on the
canoe.

â€˜typee motarkee?â€™ said she. â€˜motarkee nuee,â€™ said toby.

she then asked him whether he was going to nukuheva; he nodded yes; and
with a plaintive wail and her eyes filling with tears she rose and left
him.

this old woman, the sailor afterwards said, was the wife of an aged king
of a small island 
 
 ___________________________
 
valley, communicating by a deep pass with the country
of the typees. the inmates of the two valleys were related to each other
by blood, and were known by the same name. the old woman had gone down
into the typee valley the day before, and was now with three chiefs, her
sons, on a visit to her kinsmen.

as the old kingâ€™s wife left him, jimmy again came up to toby, and told
him that he had just talked the whole matter over with the natives, and
there was only one course for him to follow. they would not allow him to
go back into the valley, and harm would certainly come to both him and
me, if he remained much longer on the beach. â€˜so,â€™ said he, â€˜you and i
had better go to nukuheva now overland, and tomorrow i will bring tommo,
as they call him, by water; they have promised to carry him down to the
sea for me early in the morning, so that there will

 be no delay.â€™

â€˜no, no,â€™ said toby desperately, â€˜i will not leave him that way; we must
escape together.â€™

â€˜then there is no hope for you,â€™ exclaimed the sailor, â€˜for if i leave
you here on the beach, as soon as i am gone you will be carried back
into the valley, and then neither of you will ever look upon the
sea again.â€™ and with many oaths he swore that if he would only go to
nukuheva with him that day, he would be sure to have me there the very
next morning.

â€˜but how do you know they will bring him down to the 
 
 ___________________________
 
beach tomorrow,
when they will not do so today?â€™ said toby. but the sailor had many
reasons, all of which were so mixed up with the mysterious customs
of the islanders, that he was none the wiser. indeed, their conduct,
especially in preventing him from returning into the valley, was
absolutely unaccountable to him; and added to everything else, was the
bitter reflection, that the old sailor, after all, might possibly be
deceiving him. and then again he had to think of me, left alone with the
natives, and by no means well. if he went with jimmy, he mig

s
courageous spirit was of no use to him now. there he was, all by
himself, seated upon the broken canoe--the natives grouped around him at
a distance, and eyeing him more and more fixedly. â€˜it is getting late:
said jimmy, who was standing behind the rest. â€˜nukuheva is far off, and
i cannot cross the happar country by night. you see how it is;--if you
come along with me, all will be well; if you do not, depend upon it,
neither of you will ever escape.â€™

â€˜there is no help for it,â€™ said toby, at last, with a heavy heart, â€˜i
will have to trust you,â€™ and he came out from the shadow of the little
shrine, and cast a long look up the valley.

â€˜now keep close to my side,â€™ said the sailor, â€˜and let us be moving
quickly.â€™ tinor and fayaway here appeared; the kindhearted old woman
embracing tobyâ€™s knees, and giving way to a flood of tears; while
fayaway, hardly less moved, spoke some few words of english she had
learned, and held up three fingers before him--in so many days he
 
 ___________________________
 
 would
return.

at last jimmy pulled toby out of the crowd, and after calling to a
young typee who was standing by with a young pig in his arms, all three
started for the mountains.

â€˜i have told them that you are coming back again,â€™ said the old fellow,
laughing, as they began the ascent, â€˜but theyâ€™ll have to wait a long
time.â€™ toby turned, and saw the natives all in motion--the girls waving
their tappas in adieu, and the men their spears. as the last figure
entered the grove with one arm raised, and the three fingers spread, his
heart smote him.

as the natives had at last consented to his going, it might have been,
that some of them, at least, really counted upon his speedy return;
probably supposing, as indeed he had told them when they were coming
down the valley, that his only object in leaving them was to procure the

with tommo. cheer up, then, and rely upon me, you will see him in the
morning.â€™

the ascent of the mountain was not very difficult, owing to its being
near to the sea, where the island ridges are comparatively low; the
path, too, was a fine one, so that in a short time all three were
standing on the summit with the two valleys at their feet. the white
cascade marking the green head of the typee valley first caught tobyâ€™s
eye; marheyoâ€™s house could easily be traced by them.

as jimmy led the way along the ridge, toby observed that the valley of
the happars did not extend near so far inland as that of the typees.
this accounted for our mistake in entering the latter valley as we had.

a path leading down from the mountain was soon seen, and, following it,
the party were in a short time fairly in the happar valley.

â€˜now,â€™ said jimmy, as they hurried on, â€˜we taboo men have wives in all
the bays, and i

am going to show you the two i have here.â€™

so, when they came to the house where he said they lived,--which was
close by the base of the mountain in a shady nook among the groves--he
went in, and was quite furious at finding it empty--the ladies, had gone
out. however, they soon made their appearance, and to tell the truth,
welcomed jimmy quite cordially, as well as toby, about whom they were
very inquisitive. nevertheless, as the report of their arrival spread,
and the happars began to assemble, it became evident that the appearance
of a white stranger among them was not by any means deemed so wonderful
an event as in the neighbouring valley.

the old sailor now bade his wives prepare something to eat, as he must
be in nukuheva before dark. a meal of fish, bread-fruit, and bananas,
was accordingly served up, the party regaling themselves on the mats, in

the happars put many questions to jimmy about toby; and toby himself
looked sharply at them, anxious to recognize the fellow who gave him the
wound from which he was still suffering. but this fiery gentleman, so
handy with his spear, had the delicacy, it seemed, to keep out of view.
certainly the sight of him would not have been any added inducement to
making a stay in the valley,--some of the afternoon loungers in happar
having politely urged toby to spend a few days with them,--there was a
feast coming on. he, however, declined.

all this while the young typee stuck to jimmy like his shadow, and
though as lively a dog as any of his tribe, he was now as meek as
a lamb, never opening his mouth except to eat. although some of the
happars looked queerly at him, others were more civil, and seemed
desirous of taking him abroad and showing him the valley. but the typee
was not to be cajoled in that way. how many yards he would have to

rom jimmy before the taboo would be powerless, it would be hard
to tell, but probably he himself knew to a fraction.

on the promise of a red cotton handkerchief, and something else which he
kept secret, this poor fellow had undertaken a rather ticklish journey,
though, as far as toby could ascertain, it was something that had never
happened before.

the island-punch--arva--was brought in at the conclusion of the repast,
and passed round in a shallow calabash.

now my comrade, while seated in the happar house, began to feel more
troubled than ever at leaving me; indeed, so sad did he feel that he
talked about going back to the valley, and wanted jimmy to escort him
as far as the mountains. but the sailor would not listen to him, and, by
way of diverting his thoughts, pressed

t into an innocent beverage that
would inspirit them for the rest of their journey. so at last he was
induced to drink of it, and its effects were just as the sailor had
predicted; his spirits rose at once, and all his gloomy thoughts left
him.

the old rover now began to reveal his true character, though he was
hardly suspected at the time. â€˜if i get you off to a ship,â€™ said he,
â€˜you will surely give a poor fellow something for saving you.â€™ in short,
before they left the house, he made toby promise that he would give him
five spanish dollars if he succeeded in getting any part of his wages
advanced from the vessel, aboard of which they were going; toby,
moreover, engaging to reward him still further, as soon as my
deliverance was accomplished.

a little while after this they started again, accompanied by many of the
natives, and going up the valley, took a steep path near its head,
which led to nukuheva. here the happars paused and watched them as they
ascended the mountain, one g

s ferns. at last they entered upon a wooded
tract, and here they overtook a party of nukuheva natives, well armed,
and carrying bundles of long poles. jimmy seemed to know them all very
well, and stopped for a while, and had a talk about the â€˜wee-weesâ€™, as
the people of nukuheva call the monsieurs.

the party with the poles were king mowannaâ€™s men, and by his orders they
had been gathering them in the ravines for his allies the french.

leaving these fellows to trudge on with their loads, toby and his
companions now pushed forward again, as the sun was already low in the
west. they came upon the valleys of nukuheva on one side of the bay,
where the highlands slope off into the sea. the men-of-war were still
lying in the harbour, and as toby looked down upon them, the strange
events which had happened so recently, seemed all a dream.

they soon descended towards the beach, and found themselves in jimmyâ€™s
house before it was well dark. here he received another welcome from
his nukuhe

va wives, and after some refreshments in the shape of cocoanut
milk and poee-poee, they entered a canoe (the typee of course going
along) and paddled off to a whaleship which was anchored near the shore.
this was the vessel in want of men. our own had sailed some time before.
the captain professed great pleasure at seeing toby, but thought from
his exhausted appearance that he must be unfit for duty. however, he
agreed to ship him, as well as his comrade, as soon as he should arrive.
toby begged hard for an armed boat, in which to go round to typee and
rescue me, notwithstanding the promises of jimmy. but this the captain
would not hear of, and told him to have patience, for the sailor would
be faithful to his word. when, too, he demanded the five silver dollars
for jimmy, the captain was unwilling to give them. but toby insisted
upon it, as he now began to think that jimmy might be a mere mercenary,
who would be sure to prove faithless if not well paid. accordingly he
not only

gave him the money, but took care to assure him, over and over
again, that as soon as he brought me aboard he would receive a still
larger sum.

before sun-rise the next day, jimmy and the typee started in two of the
shipâ€™s boats, which were manned by tabooed natives. toby, of course, was
all eagerness to go along, but the sailor told him that if he did, it
would spoil all; so, hard as it was, he was obliged to remain.

towards evening he was on the watch, and descried the boats turning the
headland and entering the bay. he strained his eyes, and thought he saw
me; but i was not there. descending from the mast almost distracted, he
grappled jimmy as he struck the deck, shouting in a voice that startled
him, â€˜where is tommo?â€™ the old fellow faltered, but soon

recovering,
did all he could to soothe him, assuring him that it had proved to be
impossible to get me down to the shore that morning; assigning many
plausible reasons, and adding that early on the morrow he was going to
visit the bay again in a french boat, when, if he did not find me on the
beach--as this time he certainly expected to--he would march right back
into the valley, and carry me away at all hazards. he, however, again
refused to allow toby to accompany him. now, situated as toby was, his
sole dependence for the present was upon this jimmy, and therefore he
was fain to comfort himself as well as he could with what the old sailor
told him. the next morning, however, he had the satisfaction of seeing
the french boat start with jimmy in it. tonight, then, i will see him,
thought toby; but many a long day passed before he ever saw tommo again.
hardly was the boat out of sight, when the captain came forward and
ordered the anchor weighed; he was going to sea.

tobyâ€™s ravings--they were disregarded; and when he came to
himself, the sails were set, and the ship fast leaving the land.

... â€˜oh!â€™ said he to me at our meeting, â€˜what sleepless nights were
mine. often i started from my hammock, dreaming you were before me, and
upbraiding me for leaving you on the island.â€™

       . . . . . . .

there is little more to be related. toby left this vessel at new
zealand, and after some further adventures, arrived home in less than
two years after leaving the marquesas. he always thought of me as
dead--and i had every reason to suppose that he too was no more; but a
strange meeting was in store for us, one which made tobyâ€™s heart all the
lighter.
