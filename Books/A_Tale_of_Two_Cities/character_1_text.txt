n, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that
faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is
among the most striking and necessary of the advocate’s accomplishments.
but, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. the more
business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with sydney
carton, he always had his points at his fingers’ ends in the morning.

sydney carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was stryver’s great
ally. what the two drank together, between hilary term and michaelmas,
might have floated a king’s ship. stryver never had a case in hand,
anywhere, but carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring
at the ceiling of the court; they went the same circuit, and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily

odgings, like a dissipated cat. at last, it began to get about,
among such as were interested in the matter, that although sydney carton
would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he
rendered suit and service to stryver in that humble capacity.

“ten o’clock, sir,” said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to
wake him--“ten o’clock, sir.”

“_what’s_ the matter?”

“ten o’clock, sir.”

“what do you mean? ten o’clock at night?”

“yes, sir. your honour told me to call you.”

“oh! i remember. very well, very well.”

the jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming
again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.

“you were very sound, sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses
to-day. every question told.”

“i always am sound; am i not?”

“i don’t gainsay it. what has roughened your temper? put some punch to
it and smooth it again.”

with a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.

his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, “the
old seesaw sydney. up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and
now in despondency!”

“ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! the same sydney, with the same
luck. even then, i did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own.”

“and why not?”

“god knows. it was my way, i suppose.”

the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
by-and-bye into our lives.”

“there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”
 sydney carton struck in, in his moody way.

the footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more
rapid. the corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,
as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some
coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in
the distant streets, and not one within sight.

are we to divide them among us?”

he studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease, and was equably cheerful. to him, now entered charles darnay, at
sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.

“charles darnay! i rejoice to see you. we have been counting on your
return these three or four days past. mr. stryver and sydney carton were
both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.”

“i am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,” he answered,
a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the doctor. “miss
manette--”

“is well,” said the doctor, as he stopped short, “and your return will
delight us all. she has gone out on some household matters, but will
soon be home.”

“i don’t mean that. i mean i am a man of more--more--”

“well! i’ll say gallantry. my meaning is that i am a man,” said stryver,
inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, “who cares more to
be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
to be agreeable, in a woman’s society, than you do.”

“go on,” said sydney carton.

“no; but before i go on,” said stryver, shaking his head in his bullying
way, “i’ll have this out with you. you’ve been at doctor manette’s house
as much as i have, or more than i have. why, i have been ashamed of your
moroseness there! your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, i have been ashamed of you,
sydney!”

“you don’t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,”
 answered carton, with a careless air; “i wish you would keep to that. as
to me--will you never understand that i am incorrigible?”

he asked the question with some appearance of scorn.

“you have no business to be incorrigible,” was his friend’s answer,
delivered in no very soothing tone.

“i have no business to be, at all, that i know of,” said sydney carton.
“who is the lady?”

“now, don’t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable,
sydney,” said mr. stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
for the disclosure he was about to make, “because i know you don’t mean
half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. i
make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to
me in slighting terms.”

“i did?”

“certainly; and in these chambers.”

think of the expression, than i should be annoyed by a man’s opinion of
a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
of mine, who had no ear for music.”

sydney carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
looking at his friend.

“now you know all about it, syd,” said mr. stryver. “i don’t care about
fortune: she is a charming creature, and i have made up my mind to
please myself: on the whole, i think i can afford to please myself. she

stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of
showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.
“make the best of it, my dear sir,” said stryver; “say no more about it;
thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!”

mr. lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. mr. stryver
was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.




xiii. the fellow of no delicacy


if sydney carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the
house of doctor manette. he had been there often, during a whole year,
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. when he
cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
pierced by the light within him.

and yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,
and for the senseless stones that made their pavements.

purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,
shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. so wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds, that mr. lorry and miss pross,
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible
crime.




xx. a plea


when the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to
offer his congratulations, was sydney carton. they had not been at home
many hours, when he presented himself. he was not improved in habits, or
in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
about him, which was new to the observation of charles darnay.

he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window, and of
speaking to him when no one overheard.

“mr. darnay,” said carton, “i wish we might be friends.”

“we are already friends, i hope.”

“you are good enough to say so, a
 
 ___________________________
 
f saying that i am placed on the footing i have
indicated. i thank you, darnay. i may use that freedom with your name?”

“i think so, carton, by this time.”

they shook hands upon it, and sydney turned away. within a minute
afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.

when he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with miss
pross, the doctor, and mr. lorry, charles darnay made some mention of
this conversation in general terms, and spoke of sydney carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness. he spoke of him, in short, not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw
him as he showed himself.

he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found
her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked.

“we are thoughtful to-night!” said darnay, drawing his arm about her.

lly of earth, but had in them that breath
of heaven. sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were
mingled with them also, and both were audible to lucie, in a hushed
murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as
the little lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or
dressing a doll at her mother’s footstool, chattered in the tongues of
the two cities that were blended in her life.

the echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of sydney carton. some
half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once
done often. he never came there heated with wine. and one other thing
regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages.

“no. but i’ll swear it was a name of two syllables.”

yourself, was you called at that time?”

“barsad,” said another voice, striking in.

“that’s the name for a thousand pound!” cried jerry.

the speaker who struck in, was sydney carton. he had his hands behind
him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at mr. cruncher’s
elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old bailey itself.

“don’t be alarmed, my dear miss pross. i arrived at mr. lorry’s, to his
surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that i would not present myself
elsewhere until all was well, or unless i could be useful; i present
myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. i wish you had a
better employed brother than mr.

he drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and
drank it off. he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself
into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. seeing it, he
poured out and drank another glassful.

“look over your hand carefully, mr. barsad. take time.”

it was a poorer hand than he suspected. mr. barsad saw losing cards
in it that sydney carton knew nothing of. thrown out of his honourable
employment in england, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
there--not because he was not wanted there; our english reasons for
vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date--he knew that he had crossed the channel, and accepted service in
france: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. he
knew that under the overthrow

 no spy, and why should he so demean
himself as to make himself one?”

“i play my ace, mr. barsad,” said carton, taking the answer on himself,
and looking at his watch, “without any scruple, in a very few minutes.”

“i should have hoped, gentlemen both,” said the spy, always striving to
hook mr. lorry into the discussion, “that your respect for my sister--”

“i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her of her brother,” said sydney carton.

“you think not, sir?”

“i have thoroughly made up my mind about it.”

the smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his
ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,
received such a check from the inscrutability of carton,--who was a
mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and
failed him. while he was at a loss, carton said, resuming his former air
of contemplating cards:

“french, eh?” repeated carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him
at all, though he echoed his word. “well; he may be.”

“is, i assure you,” said the spy; “though it’s not important.”

“though it’s not important,” repeated carton, in the same mechanical
way--“though it’s not important--no, it’s not important. no. yet i know
the face.”

“i think not. i am sure not. it can’t be,” said the spy.

“it-can’t-be,” muttered sydney carton, retrospectively, and idling his
glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. “can’t-be. spoke good
french. yet like a foreigner, i thought?”

“provincial,” said the spy.

“no. foreign!” cried carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a
light broke clearly on his mind. “cly! disguised, but the same man. we
had that man before us at the old bailey.”

“now, there you are hasty, sir,” said barsad, with a smile that gave his
aquiline nose an extra inclinat

“i tell you,” said jerry, “that you buried paving-stones and earth in

“how do you know it?”

“what’s that to you? ecod!” growled mr. cruncher, “it’s you i have got a
old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!
i’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.”

sydney carton, who, with mr. lorry, had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business, here requested mr. cruncher to moderate and
explain himself.

“at another time, sir,” he returned, evasively, “the present time is
ill-conwenient for explainin’. what i stand to, is, that he knows well
wot that there cly was never in that there coffin. let him say he was,

“never you trouble your head about this man,” retorted the contentious
mr. cruncher; “you’ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
that gentleman. and look here! once more!”--mr. cruncher could not
be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his
liberality--“i’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea.”

the sheep of the prisons turned from him to sydney carton, and said,
with more decision, “it has come to a point. i go on duty soon, and
can’t overstay my time. you told me you had a proposal; what is it?
now, it is of no use asking too much of me. ask me to do anything in my
office, putting my head in great extra danger, and i had better trust my
life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. in short,
i should make that choice. you talk of desperation. we are all desperate

“not very much. you are a turnkey at the conciergerie?”

 said the spy, firmly.

“why need you tell me what i have not asked? you are a turnkey at the
conciergerie?”

“i am sometimes.”

“you can be when you choose?”

“i can pass in and out when i choose.”

sydney carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. it being all spent, he
said, rising:

“so far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that
the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. come
into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.”

“that at least is true,” said mr. lorry. “say no more now. it may be
that i shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
action--not in words. i want no more words.”

mr. cruncher knuckled his forehead, as sydney carton and the spy
returned from the dark room. “adieu, mr. barsad,” said the former; “our
arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.”

he sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against mr. lorry. when they
were alone, mr. lorry asked him what he had done?

“not much. if it should go ill with the prisoner, i have ensured access
to him, once.”

mr. lorry’s countenance fell.

the prison every day. “she came out here,” he said, looking about him,
“turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. let me follow in
her steps.”

it was ten o’clock at night when he stood before the prison of la force,
where she had stood hundreds of times. a little wood-sawyer, having
closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.

“good night, citizen,” said sydney carton, pausing in going by; for, the
man eyed him inquisitively.

“how goes the republic?”

for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
terror--he stopped at a chemist’s shop, which the owner was closing with
his own hands. a small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill
thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.

giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his
counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. “whew!” the chemist
whistled softly, as he read it. “hi! hi! hi!”

sydney carton took no heed, and the chemist said:

“for you, citizen?”

“for me.”

“you will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? you know the
consequences of mixing them?”

“perfectly.”

certain small packets were made and given to him. he put them, one by
one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,
and deliberately left the shop. “there is nothing more to do,” said he,
glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow. i can’t sleep.”

 priestly impostors, plunderers, and
profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon
the gates, for eternal sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets
along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting spirit ever arose among
the people out of all the working of the guillotine; with a solemn
interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
short nightly pause in fury; sydney carton crossed the seine again for
the lighter streets.

few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy
shoes, and trudged. but, the theatres were all well filled, and the

one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking
for a way across the street through the mud. he carried the child over,

a trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then
glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. as its silent track
in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,
ended in the words, “i am the resurrection and the life.”

mr. lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise
where the good old man was gone. sydney carton drank nothing but a
little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh
himself, went out to the place of trial.

the court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell
away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.
mr. lorry was there, and doctor manette was there. she was there,
sitting beside her father.

when her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so

as he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him
with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and
with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting
smile. as he went out at the prisoners’ door, she turned, laid her head
lovingly on her father’s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his
feet.

then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved,
sydney carton came and took her up. only her father and mr. lorry were
with her. his arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.
yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a
flush of pride in it.

“shall i take her to a coach? i shall never feel her weight.”

he carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a
coach. her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat
beside the driver.

“yes, yes, yes,” returned mr. lorry, drying his eyes, “you are right.

“yes. he will perish: there is no real hope,” echoed carton.

his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which

mr. lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.

“keep it for me until to-morrow. i shall see him to-morrow, you
remember, and i had better not take it into the prison.”

“why not?”

“i don’t know; i prefer not to do so. now, take this paper that doctor

the key was put in the lock, and turned. before the door was opened, or
as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in english: “he has never seen
me here; i have kept out of his way. go you in alone; i wait near. lose
no time!”

the door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him
face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his
features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, sydney carton.

there was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the
first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own
