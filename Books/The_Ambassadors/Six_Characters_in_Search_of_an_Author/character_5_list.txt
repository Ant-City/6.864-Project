The Boy  - 
      Timid and wretched, the fourteen-year-old Boy has been driven mute in his humiliation at having to enter the new household on the Father's charity. As a result, he suffers the Step-Daughter's contempt. He and the Child are "accessory figures" of sorts to the Mother, functioning to keep her torture "actual." Neither exist for themselves. He also wears the black of mourning.
