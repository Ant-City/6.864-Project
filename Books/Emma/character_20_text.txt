mr. frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life. his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.
now, upon his fatherâ€™s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place. there was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when mrs. perry drank tea with mrs. and miss bates, or when mrs. and miss bates returned the visit. now was the time for mr. frank churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. for a few days, every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs. weston had received. â€œi suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr. frank churchill has written to mrs. weston? i understand it was a very hands

d joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. his own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be different from himself. what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any bodyâ€™s eating it. he had been at the pains of consulting mr. perry, the apothecary, on the subject. mr. perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of mr. woodhouseâ€™s life; and upon being applied to, he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with manyâ€”perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. with such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, mr. woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair;

 but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.
there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs. westonâ€™s wedding-cake in their hands: but mr. woodhouse would never believe it.




chapter iii

mr. woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. he liked very much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from his long residence at hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. he had not much intercourse with an

and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to mr. elton.
harrietâ€™s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not to think of mr. martin, but to talk of mr. elton. miss nash had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great delight. mr. perry had been to mrs. goddardâ€™s to attend a sick child, and miss nash had seen him, and he had told miss nash, that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park, he had met mr. elton, and found to his great surprize, that mr. elton was actually on his road to london, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and mr. perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best play

emory and taste; and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.
mr. woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in. â€œso many clever riddles as there used to be when he was youngâ€”he wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.â€ and it always ended in â€œkitty, a fair but frozen maid.â€
his good friend perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had desired perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter.
it was by no means his daughterâ€™s wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition. mr. elton was the only one whose assistance she asked. he was invited to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might re

 and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. she could never see a fault in any of them. she was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own mr. wingfield in town as her father could be of mr. perry. they were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.
mr. john knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. he was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not hi

â€œit was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here. i never had much opinion of the sea air.â€
â€œmr. wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sirâ€”or we should not have gone. he recommended it for all the children, but particularly for the weakness in little bellaâ€™s throat,â€”both sea air and bathing.â€
â€œah! my dear, but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good; and as to myself, i have been long perfectly convinced, though perhaps i never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body. i am sure it almost killed me once.â€
â€œcome, come,â€ cried emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, â€œi must beg you not to talk of the sea. it makes me envious and miserable;â€”i who have never seen it! south end is prohibited, if you please. my dear isabella, i have not heard you make one in

â€œwhy, pretty well; but not quite well. poor perry is bilious, and he has not time to take care of himselfâ€”he tells me he has not time to take care of himselfâ€”which is very sadâ€”but he is always wanted all round the country. i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. but then there is not so clever a man any where.â€
â€œand mrs. perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? i have a great regard for mr. perry. i hope he will be calling soon. he will be so pleased to see my little ones.â€
â€œi hope he will be here to-morrow, for i have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence. and, my dear, whenever he comes, you had better let him look at little bellaâ€™s throat.â€

â€œwhy, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. but poor mrs. bates had a bad cold about a month ago.â€
â€œhow sorry i am! but colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn. mr. wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavyâ€”except when it has been quite an influenza.â€
â€œthat has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you mention. perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as he has very often known them in november. perry does not call it altogether a sickly season.â€
â€œno, i do not know that mr. wingfield considers it very sickly exceptâ€”
â€œah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in london it is always a sickly season. nobody is healthy in london, nobody can be. it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!â€”and the air so bad!â€

â€œi shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn, instead of coming here.â€
â€œbut why should you be sorry, sir?â€”i assure you, it did the children a great deal of good.â€
â€œand, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been to south end. south end is an unhealthy place. perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end.â€
â€œi know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite a mistake, sir.â€”we all had our health perfectly well there, never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and mr. wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and i am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.â€

â€œbut, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;â€”only consider how great it would have been.â€”an hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.â€
â€œah! my dear, as perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.â€”better not move at all, better stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air. this is just what perry said. it seemed to him a very ill-j

emmaâ€™s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her brother-in-lawâ€™s breaking out.
â€œmr. perry,â€ said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, â€œwould do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. why does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what i do?â€”at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?â€”i may be allowed, i hope, the use of my judgment as well as mr. perry.â€”i want his directions no more than his drugs.â€ he pausedâ€”and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness, â€œif mr. perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, i should be as willing to prefer cromer to south end as he could himself.â€

mr. woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;â€”but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.

vent (for it was a very great event that mr. woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of december) had been spent by harriet at hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by mrs. goddard, emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls. she was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: mrs. goddard was full of care and affection, mr. perry was talked of, and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.
emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in mrs. goddardâ€™s unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much mr. eltonâ€™s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit, a

â€œa sore-throat!â€”i hope not infectious. i hope not of a putrid infectious sort. has perry seen her? indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend. let me entreat you to run no risks. why does not perry see her?â€
emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of mrs. goddardâ€™s experience and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwardsâ€”as if quite another subject,

emma smiled and answeredâ€”â€œmy visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint, i hope; but not even i can charm away a sore throat; it is a most severe cold indeed. mr. perry has been with her, as you probably heard.â€
â€œyesâ€”i imaginedâ€”that isâ€”i did notâ€”â€
â€œhe has been used to her in these complaints, and i hope to-morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness. such a sad loss to our party to-day!â€

but at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than on harrietâ€™sâ€”more anxious that she should escape the infection, than that there should be no infection in the complaint. he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again, for the presentâ€”to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr. perry and learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her. she was vexed. it did appearâ€”there was no concealing itâ€”exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. he turned to mrs. weston to implore her assistance, â€œwould not she give him

â€œwhy, to own the truth,â€ cried miss bates, who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, â€œif i must speak on this subject, there is no denying that mr. frank churchill might haveâ€”i do not mean to say that he did not dream itâ€”i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the worldâ€”but if i am questioned about it, i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for mrs. perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the coles knew of it as well as ourselvesâ€”but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. mrs. perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed. jane, donâ€™t you remember grandmamaâ€™s telling us of it when we got home? i forget where we had been walking toâ€”very likely to randalls; yes, i think it was to randalls. mrs.

ond: and, from that day to this, i never mentioned it to a soul that i know of. at the same time, i will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint, because i know i do sometimes pop out a thing before i am aware. i am a talker, you know; i am rather a talker; and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not. i am not like jane; i wish i were. i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world. where is she?â€”oh! just behind. perfectly remember mrs. perryâ€™s coming.â€”extraordinary dream, indeed!â€
they were entering the hall. mr. knightleyâ€™s eyes had preceded miss batesâ€™s in a glance at jane. from frank churchillâ€™s face, where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy with her shawl. mr. weston had walked in. the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass. mr. knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye

 than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. she wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and testify respect and consideration. she resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield. a note was written to urge it. the invitation was refused, and by a verbal message. â€œmiss fairfax was not well enough to write;â€ and when mr. perry called at hartfield, the same morning, it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him doubt the possibility of her going to mrs. smallridgeâ€™s at the time proposed. her health seemed for the moment completely derangedâ€”appetite quite goneâ€”and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary compl

aint, which was the standing apprehension of the family, mr. perry was uneasy about her. he thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would not own it. her spirits seemed overcome. her present home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:â€”confined always to one room;â€”he could have wished it otherwiseâ€”and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description. her care and attention could not be questio

tened with the warmest concern; grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful. to take herâ€”be it only an hour or twoâ€”from her aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language she could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would nameâ€”mentioning that she had mr. perryâ€™s decided opinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. the answer was only in this short note:
â€œmiss fairfaxâ€™s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any exercise.â€
emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. in spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered t

urn without success; jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse.â€”emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish, miss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let miss woodhouse in. â€œindeed, the truth was, that poor dear jane could not bear to see any bodyâ€”any body at allâ€”mrs. elton, indeed, could not be deniedâ€”and mrs. cole had made such a pointâ€”and mrs. perry had said so muchâ€”but, except them, jane would really see nobody.â€
emma did not want to be classed with the mrs. eltons, the mrs. perrys, and the mrs. coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could she feel any right of preference herselfâ€”she submitted, therefore, and only questioned miss bates farther as to her nieceâ€™s appetite and diet, which she longed to be able to assist. on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy, and very communicative; jane would hardly eat any t

emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note. in half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from miss bates, but â€œdear jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back; it was a thing she c

same melancholy, seemed to reign at hartfieldâ€”but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was summer again. with all the eagerness which such a transition gives, emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her. she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on mr. perryâ€™s coming in soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.â€”there, with spirits freshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw mr. knightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her.â€”it was the first intimation of his being returned from london. she had been thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.â€”there was time only for the quickest arran

it would, she would listen. she might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give just praise to harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.â€”they had reached the house.
â€œyou are going in, i suppose?â€ said he.
â€œno,â€â€”replied emmaâ€”quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spokeâ€”â€œi should like to take another turn. mr. perry is not gone.â€ and, after proceeding a few steps, she addedâ€”â€œi stopped you ungraciously, just now, mr. knightley, and, i am afraid, gave you pain.â€”but if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplationâ€”as a friend, indeed, you may command me.â€”i will hear whatever you like. i will tell you exactly what i think.â€

ouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.â€”could he have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr. perry, and talked on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.
as long as mr. knightley remained with them, emmaâ€™s fever continued; but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and subduedâ€”and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some alloy. her fatherâ€”and harriet. she could not b

â€œi mentioned no names, you will observe.â€”oh! no; cautious as a minister of state. i managed it extremely well.â€
emma could not doubt. it was a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion. when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs. weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,
â€œdo not you think, miss woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?â€”do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit?â€”(here was a side-glance of great meaning at jane.) upon my word, perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!â€”oh! if you had seen her, as i did, when she was at the worst!â€â€”and when mrs. bates was saying something to emma, whispered farther, â€œwe do not say a word of any assistance that perry might have; not a word of a certain young physician from windsor.â€”oh! no; perry shall have all the credit.â€
â€œi have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, miss woodh

, resulting, she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.
â€œthank you, dear miss woodhouse, you are all kindness.â€”it is impossible to sayâ€”yes, indeed, i quite understandâ€”dearest janeâ€™s prospectsâ€”that is, i do not mean.â€”but she is charmingly recovered.â€”how is mr. woodhouse?â€”i am so glad.â€”quite out of my power.â€”such a happy little circle as you find us here.â€”yes, indeed.â€”charming young man!â€”that isâ€”so very friendly; i mean good mr. perry!â€”such attention to jane!â€â€”and from her great, her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs. elton for being there, emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.â€”after a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess, mrs. elton, speaking louder, said,
â€œyes, here i am, my good friend; and here i have been so long, that anywhere else i should think it necessary to apologise; but, the

ieving that he had always foreseen it.
â€œit is to be a secret, i conclude,â€ said he. â€œthese matters are always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. only let me be told when i may speak out.â€”i wonder whether jane has any suspicion.â€
he went to highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that point. he told her the news. was not she like a daughter, his eldest daughter?â€”he must tell her; and miss bates being present, it passed, of course, to mrs. cole, mrs. perry, and mrs. elton, immediately afterwards. it was no more than the principals were prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known at randalls, how soon it would be over highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.
in general, it was a very well approved match. some might think him, and others might think her, the most in luck. one set might recommend their all removing to donwell, and leaving hartfield for the j

the others had been talking of the child, mrs. weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the infantâ€™s appearing not quite well. she believed she had been foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of sending for mr. perry. perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but mr. weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.â€”in ten minutes, however, the child had been perfectly well again. this was her history; and particularly interesting it was to mr. woodhouse, who commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry, and only regretted that she had not done it. â€œshe should always send for perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. she could not be too soon alarmed, nor

frank churchill caught the name.
â€œperry!â€ said he to emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch miss fairfaxâ€™s eye. â€œmy friend mr. perry! what are they saying about mr. perry?â€”has he been here this morning?â€”and how does he travel now?â€”has he set up his carriage?â€
emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the laugh, it was evident from janeâ€™s countenance that she too was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.
â€œsuch an extraordinary dream of mine!â€ he cried. â€œi can never think of it without laughing.â€”she hears us, she hears us, miss woodhouse. i see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. look at her.
