as he looked the youth gripped his outcry at his throat. he saw that even if the men were tottering with fear they would laugh at his warning. they would jeer him, and, if practicable, pelt him with missiles. admitting that he might be wrong, a frenzied declamation of the kind would turn him into a worm.

he assumed, then, the demeanor of one who knows that he is doomed alone to unwritten responsibilities. he lagged, with tragic glances at the sky.

he was surprised presently by the young lieutenant of his company, who began heartily to beat him with a sword, calling out in a loud and insolent voice: "come, young man, get up into ranks there. no skulking 'll do here." he mended his pace with suitable haste. and he hated the lieutenant, who had no appreciation of fine minds. he was a mere brute.

after a time the brigade was halted in the cathedral light of a forest. the busy skirmishers were still popping. through the aisles of the wood could be seen the floating smoke from their rifles. s

once he thought he had concluded that it would be better to get killed directly and end his troubles. regarding death thus out of the corner of his eye, he conceived it to be nothing but rest, and he was filled with a momentary astonishment that he should have made an extraordinary commotion over the mere matter of getting killed. he would die; he would go to some place where he would be understood. it was useless to expect appreciation of his profound and fine sense from such men as the lieutenant. he must look to the grave for comprehension.

the skirmish fire increased to a long clattering sound. with it was mingled far-away cheering. a battery spoke.

directly the youth could see the skirmishers running. they were pursued by the sound of musketry fire. after a time the hot, dangerous flashes of the rifles were visible. smoke clouds went slowly and insolently across the fields like observant phantoms. the din became crescendo, like the roar of an oncoming train.

out of this haze they could see running men. some shouted information and gestured as the hurried.

the men of the new regiment watched and listened eagerly, while their tongues ran on in gossip of the battle. they mouthed rumors that had flown like birds out of the unknown.

"they say perry has been driven in with big loss."

"yes, carrott went t' th' hospital. he said he was sick. that smart lieutenant is commanding 'g' company. th' boys say they won't be under carrott no more if they all have t' desert. they allus knew he was a--"

n at a frantic gallop scattered the stragglers right and left.

a shell screaming like a storm banshee went over the huddled heads of the reserves. it landed in the grove, and exploding redly flung the brown earth. there was a little shower of pine needles.

bullets began to whistle among the branches and nip at the trees. twigs and leaves came sailing down. it was as if a thousand axes, wee and invisible, were being wielded. many of the men were constantly dodging and ducking their heads.

the lieutenant of the youth's company was shot in the hand. he began to swear so wondrously that a nervous laugh went along the regimental line. the officer's profanity sounded conventional. it relieved the tightened senses of the new men. it was as if he had hit his fingers with a tack hammer at home.

he held the wounded member carefully away from his side so that the blood would not drip upon his trousers.

the captain of the company, tucking his sword under his arm, produced a handkerchief and began to bi

the battle flag in the distance jerked about madly. it seemed to be struggling to free itself from an agony. the billowing smoke was filled with horizontal flashes.

men rushing swiftly emerged from it. they grew in numbers until it was seen that the whole command was fleeing. the flag suddenly sank down as if dying. its motion as it fell was a gesture of despair.

wild yells came from behind the walls of smoke. a sketch in gray

s which upon the field before the regiment had been growing larger and larger like puppets under a magician's hand.

the officers, at their intervals, rearward, neglected to stand in picturesque attitudes. they were bobbing to and fro roaring directions and encouragements. the dimensions of their howls were extraordinary. they expended their lungs with prodigal wills. and often they nearly stood upon their heads in their anxiety to observe the enemy on the other side of the tumbling smoke.

the lieutenant of the youth's company had encountered a soldier who had fled screaming at the first volley of his comrades. behind the lines these two were acting a little isolated scene. the man was blubbering and staring with sheeplike eyes at the lieutenant, who had seized him by the collar and was pommeling him. he drove him back into the ranks with many blows. the soldier went mechanically, dully, with his animal-like eyes upon the officer. perhaps there was to him a divinity expressed in the voice of th

the men dropped here and there like bundles. the captain of the youth's company had been killed in an early part of the action. his body lay stretched out in the position of a tired man resting, but upon his face there was an astonished and sorrowful look, as if he thought some friend had done him an ill turn. the babbling man was grazed by a shot that made the blood stream widely down his face. he clapped both hand to his head.

 forms.

he yelled then with fright and swung about. for a moment, in the great clamor, he was like a proverbial chicken. he lost the direction of safety. destruction threatened him from all points.

directly he began to speed toward the rear in great leaps. his rifle and cap were gone. his unbuttoned coat bulged in the wind. the flap of his cartridge box bobbed wildly, and his canteen, by its slender cord, swung out behind. on his face was all the horror of those things which he imagined.

the lieutenant sprang forward bawling. the youth saw his features wrathfully red, and saw him make a dab with his sword. his one thought of the incident was that the lieutenant was a peculiar creature to feel interested in such matters upon this occasion.

he ran like a blind man. two or three times he fell down. once he knocked his shoulder so heavily against a tree that he went headlong.

since he had turned his back upon the fight his fears had been wondrously magnified. death about to thrust him between t

this noise, following like the yelpings of eager, metallic hounds, increased to a loud and joyous burst, and then, as the sun went serenely up the sky, throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy thickets, it broke forth into prolonged pealings. the woods began to crackle as if afire.

"whoop-a-dadee," said a man, "here we are! everybody fightin'. blood an' destruction."

"i was willin' t' bet they'd attack as soon as th' sun got fairly up," savagely asserted the lieutenant who commanded the youth's company. he jerked without mercy at his little mustache. he strode to and fro with dark dignity in the rear of his men, who were lying down behind whatever protection they had collected.

a battery had trundled into position in the rear and was thoughtfully shelling the distance. the regiment, unmolested as yet, awaited the moment when the gray shadows of the woods before them should be slashed by the lines of flame. there was much growling and swearing.

"good gawd,"

the friend seemed jaded, but he interrupted his comrade with a voice of calm confidence. "it'll turn out all right in th' end," he said.

"oh, the devil it will! you always talk like a dog-hanged parson. don't tell me! i know--"

at this time there was an interposition by the savage-minded lieutenant, who was obliged to vent some of his inward dissatisfaction upon his men. "you boys shut right up! there no need 'a your wastin' your breath in long-winded arguments about this an' that an' th' other. you've been jawin' like a lot 'a old hens. all you've got t' do is to fight, an' you'll get plenty 'a that t' do in about ten minutes. less talkin' an' more fightin' is what's best for you boys. i never saw sech gabbling jackasses."

 they had become spectators. turning to the front again he saw, under the lifted smoke, a deserted ground.

he looked bewildered for a moment. then there appeared upon the glazed vacancy of his eyes a diamond point of intelligence. "oh," he said, comprehending.

he returned to his comrades and threw himself upon the ground. he sprawled like a man who had been thrashed. his flesh seemed strangely on fire, and the sounds of the battle continued in his ears. he groped blindly for his canteen.

the lieutenant was crowing. he seemed drunk with fighting. he called out to the youth: "by heavens, if i had ten thousand wild cats like you i could tear th' stomach outa this war in less'n a week!" he puffed out his chest with large dignity as he said it.

some of the men muttered and looked at the youth in awestruck ways. it was plain that as he had gone on loading and firing and cursing without proper intermission, they had found time to regard him. and they now looked upon him as a war devil.

untains. they had fallen like paper peaks, and he was now what he called a hero. and he had not been aware of the process. he had slept, and, awakening, found himself a knight.

he lay and basked in the occasional stares of his comrades. their faces were varied in degrees of blackness from the burned powder. some were utterly smudged. they were reeking with perspiration, and their breaths came hard and wheezing. and from these soiled expanses they peered at him.

"hot work! hot work!" cried the lieutenant deliriously. he walked up and down, restless and eager. sometimes his voice could be heard in a wild, incomprehensible laugh.

when he had a particularly profound thought upon the science of war he always unconsciously addressed himself to the youth.

there was some grim rejoicing by the men. "by thunder, i bet this army'll never see another new reg'ment like us!"

"you bet!"

these happenings had occupied an incredibly short time, yet the youth felt that in them he had been made aged. new eyes were given to him. and the most startling thing was to learn suddenly that he was very insignificant. the officer spoke of the regiment as if he referred to a broom. some part of the woods needed sweeping, perhaps, and he merely indicated a broom in a tone properly indifferent to its fate. it was war, no doubt, but it appeared strange.

as the two boys approached the line, the lieutenant perceived them and swelled with wrath. "fleming--wilson--how long does it take yeh to git water, anyhow--where yeh been to."

but his oration ceased as he saw their eyes, which were large with great tales. "we're goin' t' charge--we're goin' t' charge!" cried the youth's friend, hastening with his news.

"charge?" said the lieutenant. "charge? well, b'gawd! now, this is real fightin'." over his soiled countenance there went a boastful smile. "charge? well, b'gawd!"

 dropping with moans and shrieks. a few lay under foot, still or wailing. and now for an instant the men stood, their rifles slack in their hands, and watched the regiment dwindle. they appeared dazed and stupid. this spectacle seemed to paralyze them, overcome them with a fatal fascination. they stared woodenly at the sights, and, lowering their eyes, looked from face to face. it was a strange pause, and a strange silence.

then, above the sounds of the outside commotion, arose the roar of the lieutenant. he strode suddenly forth, his infantile features black with rage.

"come on, yeh fools!" he bellowed. "come on! yeh can't stay here. yeh must come on." he said more, but much of it could not be understood.

he started rapidly forward, with his head turned toward the men, "come on," he was shouting. the men stared with blank and yokel-like eyes at him. he was obliged to halt and retrace his steps. he stood then with his back to the enemy and delivered gigantic curses into the faces of the men.

a wave. they looked wild-eyed, and as if amazed at this furious disturbance they had stirred. in the storm there was an ironical expression of their importance. the faces of the men, too, showed a lack of a certain feeling of responsibility for being there. it was as if they had been driven. it was the dominant animal failing to remember in the supreme moments the forceful causes of various superficial qualities. the whole affair seemed incomprehensible to many of them.

as they halted thus the lieutenant again began to bellow profanely. regardless of the vindictive threats of the bullets, he went about coaxing, berating, and bedamning. his lips, that were habitually in a soft and childlike curve, were now writhed into unholy contortions. he swore by all possible deities.

once he grabbed the youth by the arm. "come on, yeh lunkhead!" he roared. "come one! we'll all git killed if we stay here. we've on'y got t' go across that lot. an' then"--the remainder of his idea disappeared in a blue haze o

f curses.

the youth stretched forth his arm. "cross there?" his mouth was puckered in doubt and awe.

"certainly. jest 'cross th' lot! we can't stay here," screamed the lieutenant. he poked his face close to the youth and waved his bandaged hand. "come on!" presently he grappled with him as if for a wrestling bout. it was as if he planned to drag the youth by the ear on to the assault.

the private felt a sudden unspeakable indignation against his officer. he wrenched fiercely and shook him off.

"come on yerself, then," he yelled. there was a bitter challenge in his voice.

they galloped together down the regimental front. the friend scrambled after them. in front of th

chapter 20

when the two youths turned with the flag they saw that much of the regiment had crumbled away, and the dejected remnant was coming slowly back. the men, having hurled themselves in projectile fashion, had presently expended their forces. they slowly retreated, with their faces still toward the spluttering woods, and their hot rifles still replying to the din. several officers were giving orders, their voices keyed to screams.

"where in hell yeh goin'?" the lieutenant was asking in a sarcastic howl. and a red-bearded officer, whose voice of triple brass could plainly be heard, was commanding: "shoot into 'em! shoot into 'em, gawd damn their souls!" there was a melee of screeches, in which the men were ordered to do conflicting and impossible things.

the youth and his friend had a small scuffle over the flag. "give it t' me!" "no, let me keep it!" each felt satisfied with the other's possession of it, but each felt bound to declare, by an offer to carry the

tter themselves against granite. and from this consciousness that they had attempted to conquer an unconquerable thing there seemed to arise a feeling that they had been betrayed. they glowered with bent brows, but dangerously, upon some of the officers, more particularly upon the red-bearded one with the voice of triple brass.

however, the rear of the regiment was fringed with men, who continued to shoot irritably at the advancing foes. they seemed resolved to make every trouble. the youthful lieutenant was perhaps the last man in the disordered mass. his forgotten back was toward the enemy. he had been shot in the arm. it hung straight and rigid. occasionally he would cease to remember it, and be about to emphasize an oath with a sweeping gesture. the multiplied pain caused him to swear with incredible power.

the youth went along with slipping uncertain feet. he kept watchful eyes rearward. a scowl of mortification and rage was upon his face. he had thought of a fine revenge upon the officer

s a dead man, he thought. so grievous did he think it that he could never possess the secret right to taunt truly in answer.

he had pictured red letters of curious revenge. "we are mule drivers, are we?" and now he was compelled to throw them away.

he presently wrapped his heart in the cloak of his pride and kept the flag erect. he harangued his fellows, pushing against their chests with his free hand. to those he knew well he made frantic appeals, beseeching them by name. between him and the lieutenant, scolding and near to losing his mind with rage, there was felt a subtle fellowship and equality. they supported each other in all manner of hoarse, howling protests.

but the regiment was a machine run down. the two men babbled at a forceless thing. the soldiers who had heart to go slowly were continually shaken in their resolves by a knowledge that comrades were slipping with speed back to the lines. it was difficult to think of reputation when others were thinking of skins. wounded men were

e freely. he was choking during this small wait for the crisis.

his friend came to him. "well, henry, i guess this is good-by-john."

"oh, shut up, you damned fool!" replied the youth, and he would not look at the other.

the officers labored like politicians to beat the mass into a proper circle to face the menaces. the ground was uneven and torn. the men curled into depressions and fitted themselves snugly behind whatever would frustrate a bullet. the youth noted with vague surprise that the lieutenant was standing mutely with his legs far apart and his sword held in the manner of a cane. the youth wondered what had happened to his vocal organs that he no more cursed.

there was something curious in this little intent pause of the lieutenant. he was like a babe which, having wept its fill, raises its eyes and fixes upon a distant toy. he was engrossed in this contemplation, and the soft under lip quivered from self-whispered words.

some lazy and ignorant smoke curled slowly. the men, hiding

from the bullets, waited anxiously for it to lift and disclose the plight of the regiment.

the silent ranks were suddenly thrilled by the eager voice of the youthful lieutenant bawling out: "here they come! right onto us, b'gawd!" his further words were lost in a roar of wicked thunder from the men's rifles.

the youth's eyes had instantly turned in the direction indicated by the awakened and agitated lieutenant, and he had seen the haze of treachery disclosing a body of soldiers of the enemy. they were so near that he could see their features. there was a recognition as he looked at the types of faces. also he perceived with dim amazement that their uniforms were rather gay in effect, being light gray, accented with a brilliant-hued facing. too, the clothes seemed new.

these troops had apparently been going forward with caution, their rifles held in readiness, when the youthful lieutenant had discove

e wafted to them.

"where th' hell yeh been?"

"what yeh comin' back fer?"

"why didn't yeh stay there?"

"was it warm out there, sonny?"

"goin' home now, boys?"

one shouted in taunting mimicry: "oh, mother, come quick an' look at th' sojers!"

there was no reply from the bruised and battered regiment, save that one man made broadcast challenges to fist fights and the red-bearded officer walked rather near and glared in great swashbuckler style at a tall captain in the other regiment. but the lieutenant suppressed the man who wished to fist fight, and the tall captain, flushing at the little fanfare of the red-bearded one, was obliged to look intently at some trees.

the youth's tender flesh was deeply stung by these remarks. from under his creased brows he glowered with hate at the mockers. he meditated upon a few revenges. still, many in the regiment hung their heads in criminal fashion, so that it came to pass that the men trudged with sudden heaviness, as if they bore upon their bended sho

ulders the coffin of their honor. and the youthful lieutenant, recollecting himself, began to mutter softly in black curses.

they turned when they arrived at their old position to regard the ground over which they had charged.

the youth in this contemplation was smitten with a large astonishment. he discovered that the distances, as compared with the brilliant measurings of his mind, were trivial and ridiculous. the stolid trees, where much had taken place, seemed incredibly near. the time, too, now that he reflected, he saw to have been short. he wonde

 could," he said calmly.

"as far as you could? did you, b'gawd?" snorted the other. "well, that wasn't very far, was it?" he added, with a glance of cold contempt into the other's eyes. "not very far, i think. you were intended to make a diversion in favor of whiterside. how well you succeeded your own ears can now tell you." he wheeled his horse and rode stiffly away.

the colonel, bidden to hear the jarring noises of an engagement in the woods to the left, broke out in vague damnations.

the lieutenant, who had listened with an air of impotent rage to the interview, spoke suddenly in firm and undaunted tones. "i don't care what a man is--whether he is a general or what--if he says th' boys didn't put up a good fight out there he's a damned fool."

"lieutenant," began the colonel, severely, "this is my own affair, and i'll trouble you--"

the lieutenant made an obedient gesture. "all right, colonel, all right," he said. he sat down with an air of being content with himself.

the youth exclaimed with sudden exasperation: "he's a lunkhead! he makes me mad. i wish he'd come along next time. we'd show 'im what--"

he ceased because several men had come hurrying up. their faces expressed a bringing of great news.

"o flem, yeh jest oughta heard!" cried one, eagerly.

"heard what?" said the youth.

"yeh jest oughta heard!" repeated the other, and he arranged himself to tell his tidings. the others made an excited circle. "well, sir, th' colonel met your lieutenant right by us--it was damnedest thing i ever heard--an' he ses: 'ahem! ahem!' he ses.

nd his friend had said: "huh!" "yer lyin' thompson." "oh, go t' blazes!" "he never sed it." "oh, what a lie!" "huh!" but despite these youthful scoffings and embarrassments, they knew that their faces were deeply flushing from thrills of pleasure. they exchanged a secret glance of joy and congratulation.

they speedily forgot many things. the past held no pictures of error and disappointment. they were very happy, and their hearts swelled with grateful affection for the colonel and the youthful lieutenant.




chapter 22

when the woods again began to pour forth the dark-hued masses of the enemy the youth felt serene self-confidence. he smiled briefly when he saw men dodge and duck at the long screechings of shells that were thrown in giant handfuls over them. he stood, erect and tranquil, watching the attack begin against apart of the line that made a blue curve along the side of an adjacent hill. his vision being unmolested by smoke from the rifles of his companions, he had opportunities to se

eir eager arms pounded the cartridges into the rifle barrels. the front of the regiment was a smoke-wall penetrated by the flashing points of yellow and red.

wallowing in the fight, they were in an astonishingly short time resmudged. they surpassed in stain and dirt all their previous appearances. moving to and fro with strained exertion, jabbering all the while, they were, with their swaying bodies, black faces, and glowing eyes, like strange and ugly fiends jigging heavily in the smoke.

the lieutenant, returning from a tour after a bandage, produced from a hidden receptacle of his mind new and portentous oaths suited to the emergency. strings of expletives he swung lashlike over the backs of his men, and it was evident that his previous efforts had in nowise impaired his resources.

the youth, still the bearer of the colors, did not feel his idleness. he was deeply absorbed as a spectator. the crash and swing of the great drama made him lean forward, intent-eyed, his face working in small co

readful earnestness, as if he conceived that one great shriek would make him well.

the youth saw him presently go rearward. his strength seemed in nowise impaired. he ran swiftly, casting wild glances for succor.

others fell down about the feet of their companions. some of the wounded crawled out and away, but many lay still, their bodies twisted into impossible shapes.

the youth looked once for his friend. he saw a vehement young man, powder-smeared and frowzled, whom he knew to be him. the lieutenant, also, was unscathed in his position at the rear. he had continued to curse, but it was now with the air of a man who was using his last box of oaths.

for the fire of the regiment had begun to wane and drip. the robust voice, that had come strangely from the thin ranks, was growing rapidly weak.




chapter 23

the colonel came running along the back of the line. there were other officers following him. "we must charge'm!" they shouted. "we must charge'm!" they cried with resentful voices, as
