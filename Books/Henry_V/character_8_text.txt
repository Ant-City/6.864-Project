of the true line and stock of charles the great:
to find his title with some shewes of truth,
though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,
conuey'd himselfe as th' heire to th' lady lingare,
daughter to charlemaine, who was the sonne
to lewes the emperour, and lewes the sonne
of charles the great: also king lewes the tenth,
who was sole heire to the vsurper capet,
could not keepe quiet in his conscience,
wearing the crowne of france, 'till satisfied,
that faire queene isabel, his grandmother,
was lineall of the lady ermengare,
daughter to charles the foresaid duke of loraine:
by the which marriage, the lyne of charles the great
was re-vnited to the crowne of france.
so, that as cleare as is the summers sunne,
king pepins title, and hugh capets clayme,
king lewes his satisfaction, all appeare
to hold in right and title of the female:
so doe the kings of france vnto this day.
howbeit, they would hold vp this salique law,
to barre your highnesse clayming fr
