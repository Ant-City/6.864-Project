Touchstone - 
                 A
clown in Duke Frederick's court who accompanies Rosalind and Celia
in their flight to Ardenne. Although Touchstone's job, as fool,
is to criticize the behavior and point out the folly of those around
him, Touchstone fails to do so with even a fraction of Rosalind's
grace. Next to his mistress, the clown seems hopelessly vulgar and
narrow-minded. Almost every line he speaks echoes with bawdy innuendo.
