 raised to a sort of ecstatic triumph, and in this mood the fleeting brilliant impressions of the summer at sherry island were ready grist to his mill. he became a golf champion and defeated mr. t. a. hedrick in a marvellous match played a hundred times over the fairways of his imagination, a match each detail of which he changed about untiringly--sometimes he won with almost laughable ease, sometimes he came up magnificently from behind. again, stepping from a pierce-arrow automobile, like mr. mortimer jones, he strolled frigidly into the lounge of the sherry island golf club--or perhaps, surrounded by an admiring crowd, he gave an exhibition of fancy diving from the spring-board of the club raft. . . . among those who watched him in open-mouthed wonder was mr. mortimer jones.

and one day it came to pass that mr. jones--himself and not his ghost--came up to dexter with tears in his eyes and said that dexter was the ---- best caddy in the club, and wouldn't he decide not to quit if mr. jones made i

y--

"no, sir," said dexter decisively, "i don't want to caddy any more." then, after a pause: "i'm too old."

"you're not more than fourteen. why the devil did you decide just this morning that you wanted to quit? you promised that next week you'd go over to the state tournament with me."

"i decided i was too old."

dexter handed in his "a class" badge, collected what money was due him from the caddy master, and walked home to black bear village.

"the best ---- caddy i ever saw," shouted mr. mortimer jones over a drink that afternoon. "never lost a ball! willing! intelligent! quiet! honest! grateful!"

the little girl who had done this was eleven--beautifully ugly as little girls are apt to be who are destined after a few years to be inexpressibly lovely and bring no end of misery to a great number of men. the spark, however, was perceptible. there was a general ungodliness in the way her lips twisted down at the corners when she smiled, and in the--heaven help us!--in the almost passionate quali

stopped.

"boy--"

beyond question he was addressed. not only that, but he was treated to that absurd smile, that preposterous smile--the memory of which at least a dozen men were to carry into middle age.

"boy, do you know where the golf teacher is?"

"he's giving a lesson."

"well, do you know where the caddy-master is?"

"he isn't here yet this morning."

"oh." for a moment this baffled her. she stood alternately on her right and left foot.

"we'd like to get a caddy," said the nurse. "mrs. mortimer jones sent us out to play golf, and we don't know how without we get a caddy."

here she was stopped by an ominous glance from miss jones, followed immediately by the smile.

"there aren't any caddies here except me," said dexter to the nurse, "and i got to stay here in charge until the caddy-master gets here."

"oh."

miss jones and her retinue now withdrew, and at a proper distance from dexter became involved in a heated conversation, which was concluded by miss jones taking one of the clubs and hi

heerer a violent rush."

there was not the faintest emphasis on the name, yet dexter was suddenly ashamed.

"oh, take me home," cried judy suddenly; "i don't want to go back to that idiotic dance--with those children."

then, as he turned up the street that led to the residence district, judy began to cry quietly to herself. he had never seen her cry before.

the dark street lightened, the dwellings of the rich loomed up around them, he stopped his coup√© in front of the great white bulk of the mortimer joneses house, somnolent, gorgeous, drenched with the splendor of the damp moonlight. its solidity startled him. the strong walls, the steel of the girders, the breadth and beam and pomp of it were there only to bring out the contrast with the young beauty beside him. it was sturdy to accentuate her slightness--as if to show what a breeze could be generated by a butterfly's wing.

he sat perfectly quiet, his nerves in wild clamor, afraid that if he moved he would find her irresistibly in his arms. tw
