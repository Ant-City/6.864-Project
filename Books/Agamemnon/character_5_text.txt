this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme
and consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further
significance which is almost symbolic. cassandra is, as it were, the
incarnation of that knowledge which herodotus describes as the crown of
sorrow, the knowledge which sees and warns and cannot help (hdt. ix. 16).
agamemnon himself, the king of kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol
of pride and the fall of pride. we must not think of him as bad or
specially cruel. the watchman loved him (ll. 34 f.), and the lamentations
of the elders over his death have a note of personal affection (pp. 66
ff.). but i suspect that aeschylus, a believer in the mystic meaning of
names, took the name agamemnon to be a warning that [greek: aga mimnei],
"the unseen wrath abides." _agâ_, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is
more like nemesis, the feeling that something is [greek: agan], "too
much," the condemnation of _hubris_ (pride or overgrowth) and of all
things that are in excess.

watchman.

this waste of year-long vigil i have prayed
god for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,
as sleuthhounds watch, above the atreidae's hall,
till well i know yon midnight festival
of swarming stars, and them that lonely go,
bearers to man of summer and of snow,
great lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire.
  and still i await the sign, the beacon pyre
that bears troy's capture on a voice of flame
shouting o'erseas. so surely to her aim
cleaveth a woman's heart, man-passioned!

from the homeric tradition, though in homer (od. iv. 524) he is merely a
servant of aigisthos.

times in the play: cf. p. 26, ll. 587 ff., p. 55, l. 1234. it is
conventionally represented by "ololû"; as the cry to apollo, paian is
"i-ê," l. 146, and cassandra's sob is "ototoi" or "otototoi," p. 47.
