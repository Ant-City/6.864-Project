mr.[CHARACTER] 
mr.[CHARACTER] stands, in many respects, as mrs.[CHARACTER]'s
opposite. whereas she acts patiently, kindly, and diplomatically
toward others, he tends to be short-tempered, selfish, and rude.
woolf fittingly describes him as "lean as a knife, narrow as the
blade of one," which conjures both his physical presence and suggests
the sharpness (and violence) of his personality. an accomplished
metaphysician who made an invaluable contribution to his field as
a young man, mr.[CHARACTER] bears out his wife's philosophy regarding
gender: men, burdened by the importance of their own work, need
to seek out the comforts and assurances of women. throughout the
novel, mr.[CHARACTER] implores his wife and even his guests for sympathy.
mr.[CHARACTER] is uncertain about the fate of his work and its legacy,
and his insecurity manifests itself either as a weapon or a weakness.
his keen awareness of death's inevitability motivates him to dash
the hopes of young james and to bully mrs.[CHARACTER] into declaring
her love for him. this hyperawareness also forces him to confront
his own mortality and face the possibility that he, like the forgotten books
and plates that litter the second part of the novel, might sink into
oblivion.
