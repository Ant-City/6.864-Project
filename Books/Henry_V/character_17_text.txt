for bardolph, hee is white-liuer'd, and red-fac'd; by the

hee hath a killing tongue, and a quiet sword; by the
meanes whereof, a breakes words, and k

words are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say
his prayers, lest a should be thought a coward: but his
few bad words are matcht with as few good deeds; for
a neuer broke any mans head but his owne, and that was
against a post, when he was drunke. they will steale any
thing, and call it purchase. bardolph stole a lute-case,
bore it twelue leagues, and sold it for three halfepence.
nim and bardolph are sworne brothers in filching: and
in callice they stole a fire-shouell. i knew by that peece
of seruice, the men would carry coales. they would
haue me as familiar with mens pockets, as their gloues
or their hand-kerchers: which makes much against my
manhood, if i should take from anothers pocket, to put
into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of wrongs.

villany goes against my weake stomacke, and therefore
