the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness
the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to
the stormtossed heart of man, mary, star of the sea.

the three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening
scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. many a time and
oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy
chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, cissy
caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and
jacky caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with
caps to match and the name h. m. s. belleisle printed on both. for tommy
and jacky caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and
spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with
bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. they were dabbling in
the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do,
or playing with their big

 coloured ball, happy as the day was long. and
edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while
that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. he was but eleven
months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just
beginning to lisp his first babyish words. cissy caffrey bent over to
him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.

—now, baby, cissy caffrey said. say out big, big. i want a drink of
water.

and baby prattled after her:

—a jink a jink a jawbo.

as cissy caffrey that held his nose and
promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden
syrup on. what a persuasive power that girl had! but to be sure baby
boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy
bib. none of your spoilt beauties, flora macflimsy sort, was cissy
caffrey. a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with
a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe
red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. and edy boardman laughed too at
the quaint language of little brother.

but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and
master jacky. boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception
to this golden rule. the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand
which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go
wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the
martello tower had. but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was
selfwilled too and, t

d very quickly not one speck of sand was to
be seen on his smart little suit. still the blue eyes were glistening
with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and
shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him
she wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.

—nasty bold jacky! she cried.

she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:

—what’s your name? butter and cream?

—tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke edy boardman. is cissy your
sweetheart?

—nao, tearful tommy said.

—is edy boardman your sweetheart? cissy queried.

—nao, tommy said.

—i know, edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her
shortsighted eyes. i know who is tommy’s sweetheart. gerty is tommy’s
sweetheart.

—nao, tommy said on the verge of tears.

cissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to
edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
couldn’t see and to mi

female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to
get and that tired feeling. the waxen pallor of her face was almost
spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine
cupid’s bow, greekly perfect. her hands were of finely veined alabaster
with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments
could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves
in bed or take a milk footbath either. bertha supple told that once to
edy boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn
with gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to
time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever
she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her
again. no. honour where honour is due. there was an innate refinement, a
languid queenly hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in
her delicate hands and higharched instep. had kind fate but willed her

wanted at clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you
would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. she did it up all by
herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the
lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! and when she put
it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the
shine out of some people she knew. her shoes were the newest thing in
footwear (edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she
never had a foot like gerty macdowell, a five, and never would ash,
oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over
her higharched instep. her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect
proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of
her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and
wide garter tops. as for undies they were gerty’s chief care and who

his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would
understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all
the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long
long kiss. it would be like heaven. for such a one she yearns this balmy
summer eve. with all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his
affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death
us two part, from this to this day forward.

and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was
just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
little wife to be. then they could talk about her till they went blue in
the face, bertha supple too, and edy, little spitfire, because she would
be twentytwo in november. she would care for him with creature comforts
too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that
feeling of hominess. her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and

 admired tall men for a husband) with
glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache
and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful
weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little
homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but
perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to
business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze
for a moment deep down into her eyes.

edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she
buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off
and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight. but tommy said
he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the
ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but tommy said it
was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if
you please. the temper of him! o, he was a man already was little tommy

like that from everyone always petting him.

—i’d like to give him something, she said, so i would, where i won’t
say.

—on the beeoteetom, laughed cissy merrily.

gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy
saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her
life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and edy boardman said she was
sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. but not a pin cared
ciss.

—let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of
her nose. give it to him too on the same place as quick as i’d look at
him.

madcap ciss with her golliwog curls. you had to laugh at her sometimes.

her please. the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw
it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and
stopped right under gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock. the
twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and
let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their
stupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she
missed and edy and cissy laughed.

—if you fail try again, edy boardman said.

gerty smiled assent and bit her lip. a delicate pink crept into her
pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted
her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a
jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down
towards the shingle. pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw
attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. she felt the
warm flush, a danger signal always with gerty macdowell, surging a

see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her
tingling in every nerve. she put on her hat so that she could see from
underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath
caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. he was eying her as a
snake eyes its prey. her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised
the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat
to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.

edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty,
half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the
baby. irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why
no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of
hers. and she said to gerty:

—a penny for your thoughts.

—what? replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. i
was only wondering was it late.
