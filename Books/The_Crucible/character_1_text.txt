proctor,  with  difficulty:  i  -  i  have  no  witness  and  cannot  prove  it,  except  my 
word  be  taken.  but  i  know  the  children’s  sickness  had  naught  to  do  with 
witchcraft. 
 
hale, stopped, struck: naught to do - ? 
 
proctor: mr. parris discovered them sportin' in the woods. they were startled 
and took sick. 
pause. 
hale: who told you this? 
proctor, hesitates, then: abigail williams. 
hale: abigail! 
proctor: aye. 
 
hale, his eyes wide: abigail williams told you it had naught to do with 
witchcraft! 
 
proctor: she told me the day you came, sir. 
 
hale, suspiciously: why - why did you keep this? 
 
proctor:  i  never  knew  until  tonight  that  the  world  is  gone  daft  with  this 
nonsense. 
 
hale:  nonsense!  mister,  i  have  myself  examined  tituba,  sarah  good,  and

when she keeps an upright way, as i have. i am a good woman, i know it; and if 
you believe i may do only good work in the world, and yet be secretly bound to 
satan, then i must tell you, sir, i do not believe it. 
 
hale: but, woman, you do believe there are witches in - 
 
elizabeth: if you think that i am one, then i say there are none. 
 
hale: you surely do not fly against the gospel, the gospel - 
 
proctor: she believe in the gospel, every word! 
 
elizabeth: question abigail williams about the gospel, not myself! 
 
hale stares at her. 
 
proctor: she do not mean to doubt the gospel, sir, you can-not think it. this be 
a christian house, sir, a christian house. 
 
hale: god keep you both; let the third child be quickly baptized, and go you 
without fail each sunday in to sabbath prayer; and keep a solemn, quiet way 
among you. i think - 
giles corey appears in doorway.

proctor: who charged her? 
 
cheever: why, abigail williams charge her. 
 
proctor: on what proof, what proof? 
 
cheever, looking about the room: mr. proctor, i have little time. the court bid 
me search your house, but i like not to search a house. so will you hand me any 
poppets that your wife may keep here? 
 
proctor: poppets? 
 
elizabeth: i never kept no poppets, not since i were a girl. 
 
cheever, embarrassed, glancing toward the mantel where sits mary warren’s 
poppet: i spy a poppet, goody proctor.

deposition  may  be  devised  to  blind  us;  it  may  well  be  that  mary  warren  has 
been conquered by satan, who sends her here to distract our sacred purpose. if 
so, her neck will break for it. but if she speak true, i bid you now drop your 
guile and confess your pretense, for a quick confession will go easier with you.

righteous man. he is never drunk as some are, nor wastin’ his time at the shovelboard,

elizabeth: aye, sir. abigail williams - she breaks op. 
 
danforth: what of abigail williams? 
 
elizabeth: i came to think he fancied her. and so one night i lost my wits, i think, and 
put her out on the highroad. 
 
danforth: your husband - did he indeed turn from you? 
 
elizabeth, in agony: my husband - is a goodly man, sir.
