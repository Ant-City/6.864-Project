imes swung above us. at last, however,
we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the
mate, mr. arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a
squint. he and the squire were very thick and friendly, but i soon
observed that things were not the same between mr. trelawney and the
captain.

this last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on
board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the
cabin when a sailor followed us.

"captain smollett, sir, axing to speak with you," said he.

"i am always at the captain's orders. show him in," said the squire.

the captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and
shut the door behind him.

"well, captain smollett, what have you to say? all well, i hope; all
shipshape and seaworthy?"

"well, sir," said the captain, "better speak plain, i believe, even at
the risk of offence. i don't like this cruise; i don't like the men; and
i don't like my officer. that's short and sweet."

"silver's parrot?" asked the squire.

"it's a way of speaking," said the captain. "blabbed, i mean. it's my
belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but i'll tell
you my way of it--life or death, and a close run."

"that is all clear, and, i dare say, true enough," replied dr. livesey.
"we take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you believe us. next,
you say you don't like the crew. are they not good seamen?"

"i don't like them, sir," returned captain smollett. "and i think i
should have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to that."

"perhaps you should," replied the doctor. "my friend should, perhaps,
have taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be one, was
unintentional. and you don't like mr. arrow?"

"i don't, sir. i believe he's a good seaman, but he's too free with
the crew to be a good officer. a mate should keep himself to
himself--shouldn't drink with the men before the mast!"

"do you mean he drinks?" cried the squire.

place under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. then, you
are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of
them are to be berthed forward. why not give them the berths here beside
the cabin?--second point."

"any more?" asked mr. trelawney.

"one more," said the captain. "there's been too much blabbing already."

"far too much," agreed the doctor.

"i'll tell you what i've heard myself," continued captain smollett:
"that you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to
show where treasure is, and that the island lies--" and then he named
the latitude and longitude exactly.

"i never told that," cried the squire, "to a soul!"

"the hands know it, sir," returned the captain.

"livesey, that must have been you or hawkins," cried the squire.

"it doesn't much matter who it was," replied the doctor. and i could
see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to mr. trelawney's
protestation

situation of the island.

"well, gentlemen," continued the captain, "i don't know who has this
map; but i make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and mr.
arrow. otherwise i would ask you to let me resign."

"i see," said the doctor. "you wish us to keep this matter dark and to
make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's
own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. in other
words, you fear a mutiny."

"sir," said captain smollett, "with no intention to take offence, i
deny your right to put words into my mouth. no captain, sir, would be
justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that. as
for mr. arrow, i believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the
same; all may be for what i know. but i am responsible for the ship's
safety and the life of every man jack aboard of her. i see things going,
as i think, not quite right. and i ask you to take certain precautions
or let me resign my berth. and

"captain smollett," began the doctor with a smile, "did ever you hear
the fable of the mountain and the mouse? you'll excuse me, i dare say,
but you remind me of that fable. when you came in here, i'll stake my
wig, you meant more than this."

"doctor," said the captain, "you are smart. when i came in here i meant
to get discharged. i had no thought that mr. trelawney would hear a
word."

"no more i would," cried the squire. "had livesey not been here i should
have seen you to the deuce. as it is, i have heard y

he saw what was doing, "so ho, mates!" says he. "what's this?"

"we're a-changing of the powder, jack," answers one.

"why, by the powers," cried long john, "if we do, we'll miss the morning
tide!"

"my orders!" said the captain shortly. "you may go below, my man. hands
will want supper."

"aye, aye, sir," answered the cook, and touching his forelock, he
disappeared at once in the direction of his galley.

"that's a good man, captain," said the doctor.

"very likely, sir," replied captain smollett. "easy with that,
men--easy," he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and
then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships,
a long brass nine, "here you, ship's boy," he cried, "out o' that! off
with you to the cook and get some work."

and then as i was hurrying off i heard him say, quite loudly, to the
doctor, "i'll have no favourites on my ship."

i assure you i was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the
captain deeply.

swear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. "there," john would
add, "you can't touch pitch and not be mucked, lad. here's this poor old
innocent bird o' mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may
lay to that. she would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before
chaplain." and john would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had
that made me think he was the best of men.

in the meantime, the squire and captain smollett were still on pretty
distant terms with one another. the squire made no bones about the
matter; he despised the captain. the captain, on his part, never spoke
but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a
word wasted. he owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have
been wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted
to see and all had behaved fairly well. as for the ship, he had taken a
downright fancy to her. "she'll lie a point nearer t

 weather bow.

there all hands were already congregated. a belt of fog had lifted
almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. away to the
south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart,
and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was
still buried in the fog. all three seemed sharp and conical in figure.

so much i saw, almost in a dream, for i had not yet recovered from my
horrid fear of a minute or two before. and then i heard the voice of
captain smollett issuing orders. the hispaniola was laid a couple of
points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the
island on the east.

"and now, men," said the captain, when all was sheeted home, "has any
one of you ever seen that land ahead?"

"i have, sir," said silver. "i've watered there with a trader i was cook
in."

"the anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, i fancy?" asked the
captain.

"yes, sir; skeleton island they calls it. it were a main place for
pirates once, and

that hill to the nor'ard they calls the fore-mast hill; there are three
hills in a row running south'ard--fore, main, and mizzen, sir. but the
main--that's the big un, with the cloud on it--they usually calls
the spy-glass, by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the
anchorage cleaning, for it's there they cleaned their ships, sir, asking
your pardon."

"i have a chart here," says captain smollett. "see if that's the place."

long john's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the
fresh look of the paper i knew he was doomed to disappointment. this
was not the map we found in billy bones's chest, but an accurate copy,
complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single
exception of the red crosses and the written notes. sharp as must have
been his annoyance, silver had the strength of mind to hide it.

"yes, sir," said he, "this is the spot, to be sure,

drawed out. who might have done that, i wonder? the pirates were too
ignorant, i reckon. aye, here it is: 'capt. kidd's anchorage'--just
the name my shipmate called it. there's a strong current runs along the
south, and then away nor'ard up the west coast. right you was, sir,"
says he, "to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island.
leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there
ain't no better place for that in these waters."

"thank you, my man," says captain smollett. "i'll ask you later on to
give us a help. you may go."

i was surprised at the coolness with which john avowed his knowledge
of the island, and i own i was half-frightened when i saw him drawing
nearer to myself. he did not know, to be sure, that i had overheard his
council from the apple barrel, and yet i had by this time taken such a
horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that i could scarce conceal
a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.

"ah," says he, "this here is a sweet spot,

may lay to that. when you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask
old john, and he'll put up a snack for you to take along."

and clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off
forward and went below.

captain smollett, the squire, and dr. livesey were talking together on
the quarter-deck, and anxious as i was to tell them my story, i durst
not interrupt them openly. while i was still casting about in my
thoughts to find some probable excuse, dr. livesey called me to his
side. he had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had
meant that i should fetch it; but as soon as i was near enough to speak
and not to be overheard, i broke immediately, "doctor, let me speak. get

"thank you, jim," said he quite loudly, "that was all i wanted to know,"
as if he had asked me a question.

and with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. they
spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised
his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that dr. livesey
had communicated my request, for the next thing that i heard was the
captain giving an order to job anderson, and all hands were piped on
deck.

"my lads," said captain smollett, "i've a word to say to you. this
land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for. mr.
trelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just
asked me a word or two, and as i was able to tell him that every man on
board had done his duty, alow and aloft, as i never ask to see it done
better, why, he and i and the doctor are going below to the cabin to
drink your health and luck, and you'll have grog served out for you to

me to dilly-dally in our work. and so now i made
up my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and
jumped on board the jolly-boat.

by good fortune hunter pulled a good oar. we made the water fly, and the
boat was soon alongside and i aboard the schooner.

i found them all shaken, as was natural. the squire was sitting down, as
white as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!
and one of the six forecastle hands was little better.

"there's a man," says captain smollett, nodding towards him, "new to
this work. he came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, when he heard the cry.
another touch of the rudder and that man would join us."

i told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the details
of its accomplishment.

we put old redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle,
with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection. hunter
brought the boat round under the stern-port, and joyce and i set to work
loading her with powder tins

the bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy
bottom.

by this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging
round to her anchor. voices were heard faintly halloaing in the
direction of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for joyce and
hunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off.

redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the
boat, which we then brought round to the ship's counter, to be handier
for captain smollett.

"now, men," said he, "do you hear me?"

there was no answer from the forecastle.

"it's to you, abraham gray--it's to you i am speaking."

still no reply.

"gray," resumed mr. smollett, a little louder, "i am leaving this ship,
and i order you to follow your captain. i know you are a good man at
bottom, and i dare say not one of the lot of you's as bad as he makes
out. i have my watch here in my hand; i give you thirty seconds to join
me in."

there was a pause.

in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way
out, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping
the eye.

add to this that gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage
for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor
old tom redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark,
under the union jack.

if we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the
blues, but captain smollett was never the man for that. all hands were
called up before him, and he divided us into watches. the doctor and
gray and i for one; the squire, hunter, and joyce upon the other. tired
though we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to
dig a grave for redruth; the doctor was named cook; i was put sentry at
the door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up
our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.

 for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear
them roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second,
the doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh
and unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs
before a week.

"so," he added, "if we are not all shot down first they'll be glad to
be packing in the schooner. it's always a ship, and they can get to
buccaneering again, i suppose."

"first ship that ever i lost," said captain smollett.

i was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when i got to sleep, which was
not till after a great deal of tossing, i slept like a log of wood.

the rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the
pile of firewood by about half as much again when i was wakened by a
bustle and the sound of voices.

"flag of truce!" i heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with
a cry of surprise, "silver himself!"

and at that, up i jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the

could hear him adding to himself, "cap'n, is it? my heart, and here's
promotion!"

long john answered for himself. "me, sir. these poor lads have chosen me
cap'n, after your desertion, sir"--laying a particular emphasis upon the
word "desertion." "we're willing to submit, if we can come to terms,
and no bones about it. all i ask is your word, cap'n smollett, to let me
safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o'
shot before a gun is fired."

"my man," said captain smollett, "i have not the slightest desire to
talk to you. if you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. if
there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the lord help you."

"that's enough, cap'n," shouted long john cheerily. "a word from you's
enough. i know a gentleman, and you may lay to that."

we could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold
silver back. nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the
captain's answer. but silver laughed at him aloud and sl

rum. maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind's eye. but i'll
tell you i was sober; i was on'y dog tired; and if i'd awoke a second
sooner, i'd 'a caught you at the act, i would. he wasn't dead when i got
round to him, not he."

"well?" says captain smollett as cool as can be.

all that silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never have
guessed it from his tone. as for me, i began to have an inkling. ben
gunn's last words came back to my mind. i began to suppose that he had
paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round
their fire, and i reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen
enemies to deal with.

"well, here it is," said silver. "we want that treasure, and we'll have
it--that's our point! you would just as soo

captain smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his
pipe in the palm of his left hand.

"is that all?" he asked.

"every last word, by thunder!" answered john. "refuse that, and you've
seen the last of me but musket-balls."

"very good," said the captain. "now you'll hear me. if you'll come up
one by one, unarmed, i'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you
home to a fair trial in england. if you won't, my name is alexander

say--one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some
ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the
defenders. in the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged.

"toss out the fire," said the captain; "the chill is past, and we
mustn't have smoke in our eyes."

the iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by mr. trelawney, and the
embers smothered among sand.

"hawkins hasn't had his breakfast. hawkins, help yourself, and back to
your post to eat it," continued captain smollett. "lively, now, my lad;
you'll want it before you've done. hunter, serve out a round of brandy
to all hands."

and while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own mind, the
plan of the defence.

"doctor, you will take the door," he resumed. "see, and don't expose
yourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. hunter, take the east
side, there. joyce, you stand by the west, my man. mr. trelawney, you
are the best shot--you and gray will take this long north side, with the

 scattering volley, shot behind shot, like
a string of geese, from every side of the enclosure. several bullets
struck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away
and vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and
empty as before. not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel
betrayed the presence of our foes.

"did you hit your man?" asked the captain.

"no, sir," replied joyce. "i believe not, sir."

"next best thing to tell the truth," muttered captain smollett. "load
his gun, hawkins. how many should say there were on your side, doctor?"

"i know precisely," said dr. livesey. "three shots were fired on this
side. i saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the
west."

"three!" repeated the captain. "and how many on yours, mr. trelawney?"

but this was not so easily answered. there had come many from the
north--seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to
gray. from the east and west only a single shot had been fired.

it was
plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and
that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of
hostilities. but captain smollett made no change in his arrangements. if
the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would
take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats
in our own stronghold.

nor had we much time left to us for thought. suddenly, with a loud
huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side
and ran straight on the stockade. at the same moment, the fire was once
more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway

the woods. they had "got their rations for that day," as the captain put
it, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the
wounded and get dinner. squire and i cooked outside in spite of the
danger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for
horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor's patients.

out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still
breathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole,
hunter, and captain smollett; and of these, the first two were as good
as dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor's knife, and hunter,
do what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. he
lingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his
apoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the
blow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following
night, without sign or sound, he went to his maker.

as for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed, b

ve seen one since, and i can give you no fairer idea of ben gunn's
boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever
made by man. but the great advantage of the coracle it certainly
possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable.

well, now that i had found the boat, you would have thought i had had
enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime i had taken another
notion and become so obstinately fond of it that i would have carried
it out, i believe, in the teeth of captain smollett himself. this was
to slip out under cover of the night, cut the hispaniola adrift, and let
her go ashore where she fancied. i had quite made up my mind that the
mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their
hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, i thought, it would be
a fine thing to prevent, and now that i had seen how they left their
watchmen unprovided with a boat, i thought it might be done with little
risk.

down i sat to wait for darkness, and made a hea

ils were drawing; she was lying a course about
north-west, and i presumed the men on board were going round the island
on their way back to the anchorage. presently she began to fetch more
and more to the westward, so that i thought they had sighted me and were
going about in chase. at last, however, she fell right into the wind's
eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her
sails shivering.

"clumsy fellows," said i; "they must still be drunk as owls." and i
thought how captain smollett would have set them skipping.

meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another
tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead
in the wind's eye. again and again was this repeated. to and fro, up and
down, north, south, east, and west, the hispaniola sailed by swoops
and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly
flapping canvas. it became plain to me that nobody was steering. and if
so, where were the men? either they were de

down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.

at least, and at last, i was off the sea, nor had i returned thence
empty-handed. there lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneers
and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again. i had nothing
nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my
achievements. possibly i might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the
recapture of the hispaniola was a clenching answer, and i hoped that
even captain smollett would confess i had not lost my time.

so thinking, and in famous spirits, i began to set my face homeward for
the block house and my companions. i remembered that the most easterly
of the rivers which drain into captain kidd's anchorage ran from the
two-peaked hill upon my left, and i bent my course in that direction
that i might pass the stream while it was small. the wood was pretty
open, and keeping along the lower spurs, i had soon turned the corner
of that hill, and not long after waded t

"i dare you to thank me!" cried the squire. "it is a gross dereliction
of my duty. stand back."

and thereupon we all entered the cave. it was a large, airy place, with
a little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung with ferns. the
floor was sand. before a big fire lay captain smollett; and in a far
corner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, i beheld great heaps
of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold. that was flint's
treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the
lives of seventeen men from the hispaniola. how many it had cost in the
amassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep,
what brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what
shame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. ye

d the hispaniola reached bristol just as mr. blandly
was beginning to think of fitting out her consort. five men only of
those who had sailed returned with her. "drink and the devil had done
for the rest," with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite
in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about:

     with one man of her crew alive,
     what put to sea with seventy-five.

all of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or
foolishly, according to our natures. captain smollett is now retired
from the sea. gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit
with the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now
mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the
father of a family. as for ben gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he
spent or lost in three weeks, or to be more exact, in nineteen days, for
he was back begging on the twentieth. then he was given a lodge to keep,
exactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still l
