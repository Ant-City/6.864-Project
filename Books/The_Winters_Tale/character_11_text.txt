s and royal necessities made
separation of their society, their encounters, though not
personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts,
letters, loving embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embraced as it
were from the ends of opposed winds. the heavens continue their
loves!

archidamus.
i think there is not in the world either malice or matter to
alter it. you have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince
mamillius: it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever
came into my note.

camillo.
i very well agree with you in the hopes of him. it is a
gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old
hearts fresh: they that went on crutches ere he was born desire
yet their life to see him a man.

archidamus.
would they else be content to die?

camillo.
yes, if there were no other excuse why they should desire to
live.

archidamus.
if the king had no son, they would desire to li

nine changes of the watery star hath been
the shepherd's note since we have left our throne
without a burden: time as long again
would be fill'd up, my brother, with our thanks;
and yet we should, for perpetuity,
go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
yet standing in rich place, i multiply
with one we-thank-you many thousands more
that go before it.

leontes.
                   stay your thanks a while,
and pay them when you part.

ingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
i have _tremor cordis_ on me;--my heart dances;
but not for joy,--not joy.--this entertainment
may a free face put on; derive a liberty
from heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
and well become the agent:'t may, i grant:
but to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
as now they are; and making practis'd smiles
as in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as 'twere
the mort o' the deer: o, that is entertainment
my bosom likes not, nor my brows,--mamillius,
art thou my boy?

mamillius.
                 ay, my good lord.

leontes.
                                   i' fecks!
why, that's my bawcock. what! hast smutch'd thy nose?--
they say it is a copy out of mine. come, captain,
we must be neat;--not neat, but cleanly, captain:
and yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf,
are all call'd neat.--

[observing polixenes and hermione]

                      still virginalling
upon his palm?--how now, you wanton calf!
art thou my calf?

mamillius.
                  yes, if you will, my lord.

leontes.
thou want'st a rough pash, and the shoots that i have,
to be full like me:--yet they say we are
almost as like as eggs; women say so,
that will say anything: but were they false
as o'er-dy'd blacks, as wind, as waters,--false
as dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
no bourn 'twixt his and mine; yet were it true
to say this boy were like me.--come, sir page,
look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
most dear'st! my co

n good earnest.--
how sometimes nature will betray its folly,
its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
to harder bosoms! looking on the lines
of my boy's face, methoughts i did recoil
twenty-three years; and saw myself unbreech'd,
in my green velvet coat; my dagger muzzled,
lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
as ornaments oft do, too dangerous.
how like, methought, i then was to this kernel,
this squash, this gentleman.--mine honest friend,
will you take eggs for money?

mamillius.
no, my lord, i'll fight.

leontes.
you will? why, happy man be 's dole!--my brother,
are you so fond of your young prince as we
do seem to be of ours?

polixenes.
                       if at home, sir,
he's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter:
now my sworn friend, and then mine enemy;
my parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
he makes a july's day short as december;
and with his varying childness cures in me
thoughts that would thick my blood.

leontes.
                  so

men have gates, and those gates open'd,
as mine, against their will: should all despair
that hath revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
would hang themselves. physic for't there's none;
it is a bawdy planet, that will strike
where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
from east, west, north, and south: be it concluded,
no barricado for a belly: know't;
it will let in and out the enemy
with bag and baggage. many thousand of us
have the disease, and feel't not.--how now, boy!

mamillius.
i am like you, they say.

leontes.
                         why, that's some comfort.--
what! camillo there?

camillo.
ay, my good lord.

leontes.
go play, mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.--

[exit mamillius.]

camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

camillo.
you had much ado to make his anchor hold:
when you cast out, it still came home.

leontes.
                        didst note it?

camillo.
he would not stay at your petitions; made

good expedition be my friend, and comfort
the gracious queen, part of this theme, but nothing
of his ill-ta'en suspicion! come, camillo;
i will respect thee as a father, if
thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

camillo.
it is in mine authority to command
the keys of all the posterns: please your highness
to take the urgent hour: come, sir, away.

hermione.
take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
'tis past enduring.

first lady.
                    come, my gracious lord,
shall i be your playfellow?

mamillius.
                            no, i'll none of you.

first lady.
why, my sweet lord?

mamillius.
you'll kiss me hard, and speak to me as if
i were a baby still.--[to second lady.] i love you better.

second lady.
and why so, my lord?

mamillius.
                     not for because
your brows

are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
become some women best; so that there be not
too much hair there, but in a semicircle
or a half-moon made with a pen.

second lady.
                     who taught you this?

mamillius.
i learn'd it out of women's faces.--pray now,
what colour are your eyebrows?

first lady.
                               blue, my lord.

mamillius.
nay, that's a mock: i have seen a lady's nose
that has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

first lady.
                               hark ye:
the queen your mother rounds apace. we shall
present our services to a fine new prince
one of these days; and then you'd wanton with us,
if we would have you.

second lady.
                      she is spread of late
into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!

hermione.
what wisdom stirs amongst you? come, sir, now
i am for you again: p

ray you sit by us,
and tell 's a tale.

mamillius.
                    merry or sad shall't be?

hermione.
as merry as you will.

mamillius.
a sad tale's best for winter. i have one
of sprites and goblins.

hermione.
                        let's have that, good sir.
come on, sit down;--come on, and do your best
to fright me with your sprites: you're powerful at it.

mamillius.
there was a man,--

hermione.
                   nay, come, sit down: then on.

mamillius.
dwelt by a churchyard:--i will tell it softly;
yond crickets shall not hear it.

hermione.
                                 come on then,
and give't me in mine ear.

[enter leontes, antigonus, lords, and guards.]

leontes.
was he met there? his train? camillo with him?

first lord.
behind the tuft of pines i met them; never
saw i men scour so on their way: i ey'd them
even to their ships.

leontes.
                     how bles'd am i
in my just censure, in my true opinion!

ority;
which often hath no less prevail'd than so,
on your command.

leontes.
                 i know't too well.--
give me the boy:--i am glad you did not nurse him:
though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
have too much blood in him.

hermione.
                            what is this? sport?

leontes.
bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
away with him!--and let her sport herself
with that she's big with;--for 'tis polixenes
has made thee swell thus.

[exit mamillius, with some of the guards.]

hermione.
                          but i'd say he had not,
and i'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
howe'er you learn the nayward.

leontes.
                               you, my lords,
look on her, mark her well; be but about
to say, 'she is a goodly lady' and
the justice of your hearts will thereto add,
''tis pity she's not honest, honourable':
praise her but for this her without-door form,--
which, on my faith, deserves high speech,--and stra
