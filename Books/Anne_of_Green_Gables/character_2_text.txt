of it or into it had to pass over that
hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of mrs. rachelâ€™s all-seeing
eye.

she was sitting there one afternoon in early june. the sun was coming in
at the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house
was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of
bees. thomas lynde--a meek little man whom avonlea people called â€œrachel
lyndeâ€™s husbandâ€--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field
beyond the barn; and matthew cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on
the big red brook field away over by green gables. mrs. rachel knew
that he ought because she had heard him tell peter morrison the evening
before in william j. blairâ€™s store over at carmody that he meant to sow
his turnip seed the next afternoon. peter had asked him, of course, for
matthew cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about
anything in his whole life.

and yet here was matthew cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon
of a busy d

ay, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill;
moreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was
plain proof that he was going out of avonlea; and he had the buggy
and the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable
distance. now, where was matthew cuthbert going and why was he going
there?

had it been any other man in avonlea, mrs. rachel, deftly putting this
and that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both
questions. but matthew so rarely went from home that it must be
something pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest
man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where
he might have to talk. matthew, dressed up with a white collar and
driving in a buggy, was something that didnâ€™t happ

where heâ€™s gone and why,â€ the worthy woman finally concluded. â€œhe
doesnâ€™t generally go to town this time of year and he _never_ visits; if
heâ€™d run out of turnip seed he wouldnâ€™t dress up and take the buggy to
go for more; he wasnâ€™t driving fast enough to be going for a doctor.
yet something must have happened since last night to start him off. iâ€™m
clean puzzled, thatâ€™s what, and i wonâ€™t know a minuteâ€™s peace of mind or
conscience until i know what has taken matthew cuthbert out of avonlea
today.â€

accordingly after tea mrs. rachel set out; she had not far to go; the
big, rambling, orchard-embowered house where the cuthberts lived was a
scant quarter of a mile up the road from lyndeâ€™s hollow. to be sure, the
long lane made it a good deal further. matthew cuthbertâ€™s father, as
shy and silent as his son after him, had got as far away as he possibly
could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods
when he founded his homestead. green gables w

 was unsupposable
that marilla was making fun of her, but mrs. rachel was almost forced to
suppose it.

â€œare you in earnest, marilla?â€ she demanded when voice returned to her.

â€œyes, of course,â€ said marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums
in nova scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated
avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.

mrs. rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. she thought
in exclamation points. a boy! marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people
adopting a boy! from an orphan asylum! well, the world was certainly
turning upside down! she would be surprised at nothing after this!
nothing!

â€œwhat on earth put such a notion into your head?â€ she demanded
disapprovingly.

this had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be
disapproved.

â€œwell, weâ€™ve been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,â€
 returned marilla. â€œmrs. alexander spencer was up here one day before

ever _were_ children, which is hard to believe when one looks at them.
i wouldnâ€™t be in that orphanâ€™s shoes for anything. my, but i pity him,
thatâ€™s what.â€

so said mrs. rachel to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her
heart; but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently
at the bright river station at that very moment her pity would have been
still deeper and more profound.




chapter ii. matthew cuthbert is surprised


|matthew cuthbert and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight
miles to bright river. it was a pretty road, running along between
snug farmsteads, with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive
through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom. the air
was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped
away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple; while

     â€œthe little birds sang as if it were

looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.

so far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen
that the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes
were full of spirit and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped
and expressive; that the forehead was broad and full; in short,
our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no
commonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom
shy matthew cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid.

matthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon
as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with
one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag;
the other she held out to him.

â€œi suppose you are mr. matthew cuthbert of green gables?â€ she said in
a peculiarly clear, sweet voice. â€œiâ€™m very glad to see you. i was
beginning to be afraid you werenâ€™t coming for me and i was imagining

lifted her to the ground. â€œwhat nice dreams they must have!â€

then, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained â€œall her worldly
goods,â€ she followed him into the house.




chapter iii. marilla cuthbert is surprised


|marilla came briskly forward as matthew opened the door. but when her
eyes fell on the odd little figure in the stiff, ugly dress, with the
long braids of red hair and the eager, luminous eyes, she stopped short
in amazement.

â€œmatthew cuthbert, whoâ€™s that?â€ she ejaculated. â€œwhere is the boy?â€

â€œthere wasnâ€™t any boy,â€ said matthew wretchedly. â€œthere was only _her_.â€

he nodded at the child, remembering that he had never even asked her
name.

â€œno boy! but there _must_ have been a boy,â€ insisted marilla. â€œwe sent
word to mrs. spencer to bring a boy.â€

â€œwell, she didnâ€™t. she brought _her_. i asked the station-master. and i
had to bring her home. she couldnâ€™t be left there, no matter where the

what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves. richard spencerâ€™s
folks have twisted that message somehow. one of us will have to drive
over and see mrs. spencer tomorrow, thatâ€™s certain. this girl will have
to be sent back to the asylum.â€

â€œyes, i suppose so,â€ said matthew reluctantly.

â€œyou _suppose_ so! donâ€™t you know it?â€

â€œwell now, sheâ€™s a real nice little thing, marilla. itâ€™s kind of a pity
to send her back when sheâ€™s so set on staying here.â€

â€œmatthew cuthbert, you donâ€™t mean to say you think we ought to keep
her!â€

marillaâ€™s astonishment could not have been greater if matthew had
expressed a predilection for standing on his head.

â€œwell, now, no, i suppose not--not exactly,â€ stammered matthew,
uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning. â€œi
suppose--we could hardly be expected to keep her.â€

â€œi should say not. what good would she be to us?â€

â€œwe might be some good to her,â€ said matthew suddenly and unexpectedly.

plain as plain that you want to keep her.â€

â€œwell now, sheâ€™s a real interesting little thing,â€ persisted matthew.
â€œyou should have heard her talk coming from the station.â€

â€œoh, she can talk fast enough. i saw that at once. itâ€™s nothing in her
favour, either. i donâ€™t like children who have so much to say. i donâ€™t
want an orphan girl and if i did she isnâ€™t the style iâ€™d pick out.

child. good night.â€

â€œi can only say good night tonight with a clear conscience,â€ said anne,
cuddling luxuriously down among her pillows.

marilla retreated to the kitchen, set the candle firmly on the table,
and glared at matthew.

â€œmatthew cuthbert, itâ€™s about time somebody adopted that child and
taught her something. sheâ€™s next door to a perfect heathen. will you
believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight? iâ€™ll send
her to the manse tomorrow and borrow the peep of the day series, thatâ€™s
what iâ€™ll do. and she shall go to sunday-school just as soon as i can

chapter x. anneâ€™s apology


|marilla said nothing to matthew about the affair that evening; but when
anne proved still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be
made to account for her absence from the breakfast table. marilla told
matthew the whole story, taking pains to impress him with a due sense of
the enormity of anneâ€™s behavior.

â€œitâ€™s a good thing rachel lynde got a calling down; sheâ€™s a meddlesome
old gossip,â€ was matthewâ€™s consolatory rejoinder.

â€œmatthew cuthbert, iâ€™m astonished at you. you know that anneâ€™s behavior
was dreadful, and yet you take her part! i suppose youâ€™ll be saying next
thing that she oughtnâ€™t to be punished at all!â€

â€œwell now--no--not exactly,â€ said matthew uneasily. â€œi reckon she
ought to be punished a little. but donâ€™t be too hard on her, marilla.
recollect she hasnâ€™t ever had anyone to teach her right. youâ€™re--youâ€™re
going to give her something to eat, arenâ€™t you?â€

and it seems as if sheâ€™d been here always. i canâ€™t imagine the place
without her. now, donâ€™t be looking i told-you-so, matthew. thatâ€™s bad
enough in a woman, but it isnâ€™t to be endured in a man. iâ€™m perfectly
willing to own up that iâ€™m glad i consented to keep the child and that
iâ€™m getting fond of her, but donâ€™t you rub it in, matthew cuthbert.â€



chapter xiii. the delights of anticipation


|itâ€™s time anne was in to do her sewing,â€ said marilla, glancing at the
clock and then out into the yellow august afternoon where everything
drowsed in the heat. â€œshe stayed playing with diana more than half an
hour more â€˜n i gave her leave to; and now sheâ€™s perched out there on
the woodpile talking to matthew, nineteen to the dozen, when she knows
perfectly well she ought to be at her work. and of course heâ€™s listening

puzzled; he could not so quickly lose faith in anne but he had to admit
that circumstances were against her.

â€œyouâ€™re sure it hasnâ€™t fell down behind the bureau?â€ was the only
suggestion he could offer.

â€œiâ€™ve moved the bureau and iâ€™ve taken out the drawers and iâ€™ve looked
in every crack and crannyâ€ was marillaâ€™s positive answer. â€œthe brooch
is gone and that child has taken it and lied about it. thatâ€™s the plain,
ugly truth, matthew cuthbert, and we might as well look it in the face.â€

â€œwell now, what are you going to do about it?â€ matthew asked forlornly,
feeling secretly thankful that marilla and not he had to deal with the
situation. he felt no desire to put his oar in this time.

â€œsheâ€™ll stay in her room until she confesses,â€ said marilla grimly,
remembering the success of this method in the former case. â€œthen weâ€™ll
see. perhaps weâ€™ll be able to find the brooch if sheâ€™ll only tell
where she took it; but in a

â€œwell now, she shouldnâ€™t have taken the brooch, marilla, or told stories
about it,â€ he admitted, mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic
pork and greens as if he, like anne, thought it a food unsuited to
crises of feeling, â€œbut sheâ€™s such a little thing--such an interesting
little thing. donâ€™t you think itâ€™s pretty rough not to let her go to the
picnic when sheâ€™s so set on it?â€

â€œmatthew cuthbert, iâ€™m amazed at you. i think iâ€™ve let her off entirely
too easy. and she doesnâ€™t appear to realize how wicked sheâ€™s been at
all--thatâ€™s what worries me most. if sheâ€™d really felt sorry it wouldnâ€™t
be so bad. and you donâ€™t seem to realize it, neither; youâ€™re making
excuses for her all the time to yourself--i can see that.â€

â€œwell now, sheâ€™s such a little thing,â€ feebly reiterated matthew. â€œand
there should be allowances made, marilla. you know sheâ€™s never had any

december.

â€œi believe we have one or two left over,â€ she said, â€œbut theyâ€™re
upstairs in the lumber room. iâ€™ll go and see.â€ during her absence
matthew collected his scattered senses for another effort.

when miss harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired:
â€œanything else tonight, mr. cuthbert?â€ matthew took his courage in
both hands and replied: â€œwell now, since you suggest it, i might as
well--take--that is--look at--buy some--some hayseed.â€

miss harris had heard matthew cuthbert called odd. she now concluded
that he was entirely crazy.

â€œwe only keep hayseed in the spring,â€ she explained loftily. â€œweâ€™ve none
on hand just now.â€

â€œoh, certainly--certainly--just as you say,â€ stammered unhappy
matthew, seizing the rake and making for the door. at the threshold he
recollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back.
while miss harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for
a final desperate attempt.

â€œwell now--if it isnâ€™t to

d marilla were there, with eyes and ears for only one student
on the platform--a tall girl in pale green, with faintly flushed
cheeks and starry eyes, who read the best essay and was pointed out and
whispered about as the avery winner.

â€œreckon youâ€™re glad we kept her, marilla?â€ whispered matthew, speaking
for the first time since he had entered the hall, when anne had finished
her essay.

â€œitâ€™s not the first time iâ€™ve been glad,â€ retorted marilla. â€œyou do like
to rub things in, matthew cuthbert.â€

miss barry, who was sitting behind them, leaned forward and poked
marilla in the back with her parasol.

â€œarenâ€™t you proud of that anne-girl? i am,â€ she said.

anne went home to avonlea with matthew and marilla that evening. she had
not been home since april and she felt that she could not wait another
day. the apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young.
diana was at green gables to meet her. in her own white room, where
marilla had set a flowering house rose on the wi

e he said that death had been instantaneous and
probably painless, caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock. the
secret of the shock was discovered to be in the paper matthew had held
and which martin had brought from the office that morning. it contained
an account of the failure of the abbey bank.

the news spread quickly through avonlea, and all day friends and
neighbors thronged green gables and came and went on errands of kindness
for the dead and living. for the first time shy, quiet matthew cuthbert
was a person of central importance; the white majesty of death had
fallen on him and set him apart as one crowned.

when the calm night came softly down over green gables the old house was
hushed and tranquil. in the parlor lay matthew cuthbert in his coffin,
his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little
kindly smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams. there were
flowers about him--sweet old-fashioned flowers which his mother had
planted in the homestead garde

if you werenâ€™t
here--if youâ€™d never come. oh, anne, i know iâ€™ve been kind of strict and
harsh with you maybe--but you mustnâ€™t think i didnâ€™t love you as well as
matthew did, for all that. i want to tell you now when i can. itâ€™s never
been easy for me to say things out of my heart, but at times like this
itâ€™s easier. i love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood
and youâ€™ve been my joy and comfort ever since you came to green gables.â€

two days afterwards they carried matthew cuthbert over his homestead
threshold and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had
loved and the trees he had planted; and then avonlea settled back to its
usual placidity and even at green gables affairs slipped into their old
groove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before,
although always with the aching sense of â€œloss in all familiar things.â€
 anne, new to grief, thought it almost sad that it could be so--that
they _could_ go on in the old way without ma
