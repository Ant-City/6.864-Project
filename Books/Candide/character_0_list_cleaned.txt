[CHARACTER] - 
                	the
protagonist of the novel, [CHARACTER] is a good-hearted but hopelessly
naive young man. his mentor, pangloss, teaches him that their world
is "the best of all possible worlds." after being banished from
his adopted childhood home, [CHARACTER] travels the world and meets
with a wide variety of misfortunes, all the while pursuing security
and following cunegonde, the woman he loves. his faith in pangloss's
undiluted optimism is repeatedly tested. [CHARACTER] is less a realistic character
than a conduit for the attitudes and events that surround him. his
opinions and actions are determined almost entirely by the influence
of outside factors.
