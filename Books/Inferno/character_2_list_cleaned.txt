[CHARACTER] - 
                one
of the blessed in heaven, [CHARACTER] aids dante's journey by asking
an angel to find virgil and bid him guide dante through hell. like
dante and virgil, [CHARACTER] corresponds to a historical personage. although
the details of her life remain uncertain, we know that dante fell
passionately in love with her as a young man and never fell out
of it. she has a limited role in inferno but becomes more prominent
in purgatorio and paradiso. in fact, dante's entire imaginary journey
throughout the afterlife aims, in part, to find [CHARACTER], whom he
has lost on earth because of her early death. critics generally
view [CHARACTER] as an allegorical representation of 
spiritual love.
