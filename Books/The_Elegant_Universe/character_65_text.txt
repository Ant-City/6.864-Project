the  three  families  of  matter  particles  the  standard  theory,  or  (more  often)  the standard  model  of
particle physics.

messenger particles

according to the standard model, just as the photon is the smallest constituent of an electromagnetic
field, the strong and the weak force fields have smallest constituents as well. as we discussed briefly
in chapter 1, the smallest bundles of the strong force are known as gluons, and those of the weak
force are known as weak gauge bosons (or more precisely, the w and z bosons). the standard model
instructs us to think of these force particles as having no internal structure—in this framework they

wanderings  of  celestial  bodies  and  the  riotous  fulminations  of  subatomic  particles.  with  the
discovery of superstring theory, musical metaphors take on a startling reality, for the theory suggests
that the microscopic landscape is suffused with tiny strings whose vibrational patterns orchestrate the
evolution  of  the  cosmos.  the  winds  of  change,  according  to  superstring  theory,  gust  through  an
aeolian universe.

by contrast, the standard model views the elementary constituents of the universe as pointlike
ingredients  with  no  internal  structure.  as  powerful  as  this  approach  is  (as  we  have  mentioned,
essentially  every  prediction  about  the  microworld  made  by  the  standard  model  has  been  verified

and  structure  of  string  theory. as  michael  green  has
said, "the moment you encounter string theory and realize that almost all of the major developments
in physics over the last hundred years emerge—and emerge with such elegance—from such a simple
starting point, you realize that this incredibly compelling theory is in a class of its own."5 moreover,
for many of these features, as we shall discuss, string theory offers a far fuller and more satisfying
explanation than is found in the standard model. these developments convinced many physicists that
string theory was well on its way to fulfilling its promise of being the ultimate unified theory.

nonetheless, over and over again string theorists encountered a significant stumbling block. in
theoretical  physics  research,  one  is  frequently  confronted  with  equations  that  are  just  too  hard  to
understand  or  to  analyze.  typically,  physicists  don't  give  up,  but  try  to  solve  the  equations

1.2? why do the 19 parameters that describe these ingredients quantitatively have the values that they
do? you  can't  help  feeling  that  their  number  and  detailed  properties  seem  so  arbitrary.  is  there  a
deeper  understanding  lurking  behind  these  seemingly  random  ingredients,  or  were  the  detailed
physical properties of the universe "chosen" by happenstance?

the standard model itself cannot possibly offer an explanation since it takes the list of particles
and their properties as experimentally measured input. just as the performance of the stock market
cannot  be  used  to  determine  the  value  of  your  portfolio  without  the  input  data  of  your  initial
investments, the standard model cannot be used to make any predictions without the input data of the
fundamental  particle  properties.6 after  experimental  particle  physicists  fastidiously  measure  these

happen when particular particles are slammed together in an accelerator. but the standard model can
no  more  explain  the  fundamental  particle  properties  of  tables  1.1  and  1.2  than  the  dow  jones
average today can explain your initial investment in stocks ten years ago.

in  fact,  had  experiments  revealed  a  somewhat  different  particle  content  in  the  microscopic
world,  possibly  interacting  with  somewhat  different  forces,  these  changes  could  have  been  fairly
easily incorporated in the standard model by providing the theory with different input parameters.

structure of the standard model, in this sense, is too flexible to be able to explain the properties of the
elementary particles, as it could have accommodated a range of possibilities.

string theory is dramatically different. it is a unique and inflexible theoretical edifice. it requires
no input beyond a single number, described below, that sets the benchmark scale for measurements.

teristics  of  our  universe,  summarized  in
tables 1.1 and 1.2, can be explained by string theory. as we will discuss in chapter 9, under certain
assumptions that we will clearly state, string theory can give rise to a universe with properties that
are in qualitative agreement with the known particle and force data, but extracting detailed numerical
predictions from the theory is currently beyond our abilities. and so, although the framework of string
theory, unlike that of the point-particle standard model, is capable of giving an explanation for why
the particles and forces have the properties they do, we have not, as yet, been able to extract it. but
remarkably, string theory is so rich and far-reaching that, even though we cannot yet determine its
most detailed properties, we are able to gain insight into a wealth of the new physical phenomena that
follow from the theory, as we will see in subsequent chapters.

h  understanding  the  origin  of  supersymmetry  is  rather
subtle, we will focus on one of its primary implications—should the laws of nature incorporate its
principles—and this is far easier to grasp.

in  the  early  1970s,  physicists  realized  that  if  the  universe  is  supersymmetric,  the  particles  of
nature  must  come  in pairs  whose  respective  spins  differ  by  half  a  unit.  such  pairs  of  particles—
regardless of whether they are thought of as pointlike (as in the standard model) or as tiny vibrating
loops—are called superpartners. since matter particles have spin-1/2 while some of the messenger
particles  have  spin-1,  supersymmetry  appears  to  result  in  a  pairing—a  partnering—of  matter  and
force  particles.  as  such,  it  seems  like  a  wonderful  unifying  concept.  the  problem  comes  in  the
details.

by the mid-1970s, when physicists sought to incorporate supersymmetry into the standard model,
they found that none of the known particles—those

first, from an aesthetic standpoint, physicists find it hard to believe that nature would respect almost,
but not quite all of the symmetries that are mathematically possible. of course, it is possible that an
incomplete utilization of symmetry is what actually occurs, but it would be such a shame. it would be
as if bach, after developing numerous intertwining voices to fill out an ingenious pattern of musical
symmetry, left out the final, resolving measure.

second, even within the standard model, a theory that ignores gravity, thorny technical issues
that are associated with quantum processes are swiftly solved if the theory is supersymmetric. the
basic problem is that every distinct particle species makes its own contribution to the microscopic
quantum-mechanical  frenzy.  physicists  have  found  that  in  the  bath  of  this  frenzy,  certain  processes
involving particle interactions remain consistent only if numerical parameters in the standard model
are fine-tuned—to better tha

cancelling  quantum-mechanical  contributions.  like  opposite  ends  of  a  seesaw,  when  the  quantum
jitters  of  a  boson  are  positive,  those  of  a  fermion  tend  to  be  negative,  and  vice  versa.  since
supersymmetry ensures that bosons and fermions occur in pairs, substantial cancellations occur from
the outset—cancellations that significantly calm some of the frenzied quantum effects. it turns out that
the consistency of the supersymmetric standard model—the standard model augmented by all of the
superpartner particles—no longer relies upon the uncomfortably delicate numerical adjustments of the
ordinary standard model. although this is a highly technical issue, many particle physicists find that
this realization makes supersymmetry very attractive.

the third piece of circumstantial evidence for supersymmetry comes from the notion of grand
unification. one of the puzzling features of nature's four forces is the huge range in their intrinsi

his reflects that the strength increases not
merely because we are closer to the electron but also because more of the electron's intrinsic electric
field  becomes  visible.  in  fact,  although  we  have  focused  on  the  electron,  this  discussion  applies
equally well to all electrically charged particles and is summarized by saying that quantum effects
drive the strength of the electromagnetic force to get larger when examined on shorter distance scales.
what about the other forces of the standard model? how do their intrinsic strengths vary with
distance?  in  1973,  gross  and  frank  wilczek  at  princeton,  and,  independently,  david  politzer  at
harvard,  studied  this  question  and  found  a  surprising  answer:  the  quantum  cloud  of  particle
eruptions and annihilations amplifies the strengths of the strong and weak forces. this implies that as
we examine them on shorter distances, we penetrate more of this seething cloud and hence are subject
to less of its amplification. and so,

ticles. they rapidly made important strides toward incorporating
supersymmetry  into  the  framework  of  point-particle  quantum  field  theory. and  since,  at  the  time,
quantum field theory was the central rage of the mainstream particle-physics community—with string
theory increasingly becoming a subject on the fringe—the insights of wess and zumino launched a
tremendous amount of subsequent research on what has come to be called supersymmetric quantum
field theory. the supersymmetric standard model, discussed in the preceding section, is one of the
crowning theoretical achievements of these pursuits; we now see that, through historical twists and
turns, even this point-particle theory owes a great debt to string theory.

with the resurgence of superstring theory in the mid-1980s, supersymmetry has re-emerged in the
context  of  its  original  discovery.  and  in  this  framework,  the  case  for  supersymmetry  goes  well

numbers  of  particle  families,  different  number  and  types  of  fundamental  forces,  among  other
substantial deviations), a few entries in the catalog yield physics that is qualitatively close to what
we  actually  observe.  that  is,  there are  examples  of  calabi-yau  spaces  that,  when  chosen  for  the
curled-up dimensions required by string theory, give rise to string vibrations that are closely akin to
the particles of the standard model. and, of prime importance, string theory successfully stitches the
gravitational force into this quantum-mechanical framework.

with our present level of understanding, this situation is the best we could have hoped for. if
many of the calabi-yau shapes were in rough agreement with experiment, the link between a specific

somewhat fanciful, this is my favorite scenario for confirming string theory as nothing would settle the
issue quite as dramatically as seeing a string in a telescope."19

closer to earth, there are other possible experimental signatures of string theory that have been
put forward. here are five examples. first, in table 1.1 we noted that we do not know if neutrinos
are just very light, or if in fact they are exactly massless. according to the standard model, they are
massless,  but  not  for  any  particularly  deep  reason.  a  challenge  to  string  theory  is  to  provide  a
compelling explanation of present and future neutrino data, especially if experiments ultimately show
that neutrinos do have a tiny but nonzero mass. second, there are certain hypothetical processes that
are forbidden by the standard model, but that may be allowed by string theory. among these are the

extreme  of  conditions—enormous  energy,  temperature,  and  density—during  its  earliest
moments. these conditions, as is by now familiar, require that both quantum mechanics and gravity be
taken into account, and hence the birth of the universe provides a profound arena for exercising the
insights  of  superstring  theory.  we  will  discuss  these  nascent  insights  shortly,  but  first,  we  briefly
recount the pre–string theory cosmological story, which is often referred to as the standard model of
cosmology.

the standard model of cosmology

the modern theory of cosmic origins dates from the decade and a half after einstein's completion of
general relativity. although einstein refused to take his own theory at face value and accept that it
implies that the universe is neither eternal nor static, alexander friedmann did. and as we discussed
in chapter 3, friedmann found what is now known as the big bang solution to einstein's equations—a
solution that declares that the universe viole

incorporate quantum concepts—in this case, the momentary quantum-mechanical creation of virtual
string  pairs—with  the  number  of  loops  determining  the  precision  with  which  quantum-mechanical
effects are accounted for.

the strategy of beginning with a theoretical description that is classical and then subsequently
including the features of quantum mechanics has been extremely fruitful for many years. it underlies,
for example, the standard model of particle physics. but it is possible, and there is growing evidence
that it is likely, that this method is too conservative for dealing with theories that are as far-reaching
as string theory and m-theory. the reason is that once we realize that the universe is governed by
quantum-mechanical principles, our theories really should be quantum mechanical from the start. we
have successfully gotten away with starting from a classical perspective until now because we have

the particle masses, this merely shifts the burden to explaining properties of a hypothetical "mass-

but once again, if it is found and its properties measured, these will be input data for the standard

familiar  cartesian  coordinates  of  spacetime  with  new  quantum  coordinates,  say u  and v,  that  are
anticommuting: u × v =-v × u. supersymmetry can then be thought of as translations in this quantum-
mechanically augmented form of spacetime.

5. for the reader interested in more details of this technical issue we note the following. in note
6 of chapter 6 we mentioned that the standard model invokes a "mass-giving particle"—the higgs
boson—to endow the particles of tables 1.1 and 1.2 with their observed masses. for this procedure
to work, the higgs particle itself cannot be too heavy; studies show that its mass should certainly be
no greater than about 1,000 times the mass of a proton. but it turns out that quantum fluctuations tend
to contribute substantially to the mass of the higgs particle, potentially driving its mass all the way to
the planck scale. theorists have found,
