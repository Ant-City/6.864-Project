is here? what do they want? why is my mother so pale? 

“go right in,” says the capitol man, who has followed me down the hallway. 

i twist the polished brass knob and step inside. my nose registers the conflicting scents of 
roses and  blood. a  small, white-haired  man who seems  vaguely  familiar  is reading a  book. 
he holds up a finger as if to say, “give me a moment.” then he turns and my heart skips a 
beat. 

i'm staring into the snakelike eyes of president snow. 

 

 

 

in  my  mind,  president  snow  should  be  viewed  in  front  of  marble  pillars  hung  with 
oversized  flags. it's  jarring to see him  surrounded by the ordinary objects  in the room. like 
taking the lid off a pot and finding a fanged viper instead of stew. 

what could he be doing here? my mind rushes back to the opening days of other victory 
tours.  i  remember  seeing  the  winning  tributes  with  their  mentors  and  stylists.  even  some 
high  government  officials  h

right  then.  but  he  had  an  unfortunate  sentimental  streak.  so  here  you  are.  can  you  guess 
where he is?” he asks. 

i nod because, by the way he says  it, it's clear that seneca crane has been executed. the 
smell of roses and blood has grown stronger now that only a desk separates us. there's a rose 
in president snow's lapel, which at least suggests a source of the flower perfume, but it must 
be genetically enhanced, because no real rose reeks like that. as for the blood ... i don't know. 

“after that, there was nothing to do but let you play out your little scenario. and you were 
pretty  good,  too,  with  the  love-crazed  schoolgirl  bit.  the  people  in  the  capitol  were  quite 
convinced. unfortunately, not everyone in the districts fell for your act,” he says.

“what is to prevent, say, an uprising?” 

it takes a moment for his last sentence to sink in. then the full weight of it hits me. “there 

have been uprisings?” i ask, both chilled and somewhat elated by the possibility. 

“not  yet.  but  they'll  follow  if  the  course  of  things  doesn't  change.  and  uprisings  have 
been known to lead to revolution.” president snow rubs a spot over his left eyebrow, the very 
spot  where  i  myself  get  headaches.  “do  you  have  any  idea  what  that  would  mean?  how 
many people would die? what conditions those left would have to face? whatever problems 
anyone  may  have with the capitol,  believe  me when i say that  if  it released  its grip on the 
districts for even a short time, the entire system would collapse.” 

i'm taken aback by the directness and even the sincerity of this speech. as if his primary

“what a welcome sight. you know, it's funny how often people forget that presidents need 
to  eat,  too,”  president  snow  says  charmingly.  well,  it  seems  to  relax  my  mother  a  bit, 
anyway. 

“can  i  get  you  anything  else?  i  can  cook  something  more  substantial  if  you're  hungry,” 

she offers. 

“no,  this  could  not  be  more  perfect.  thank  you,”  he  says,  clearly  dismissing  her.  my 
mother nods, shoots me a glance, and goes. president snow pours tea for both of us and fills 
his with cream  and  sugar, then takes a  long time stirring. i sense  he  has  had  his  say  and  is 
waiting for me to respond. 

“i didn't mean to start any uprisings,” i tell him. 

“i  believe  you.  it  doesn't  matter.  your  stylist  turned  out  to  be  prophetic  in  his  wardrobe

“but perhaps not as taken with the young man as you would have the country believe,” he 

says. “who says i'm not?” i say. 

“i  do,”  says  the  president.  “and  i  wouldn't  be  here  if  i  were  the  only  person  who  had 

doubts. how's the handsome cousin?” 

“i don't know ... i don't ...” my revulsion at this conversation, at discussing my feelings for 

two of the people i care most about with president snow, chokes me off. 

“speak, miss everdeen. him i can easily kill off if we don't come to a happy resolution,” 
he  says.  “you  aren't  doing  him  a  favor  by  disappearing  into  the  woods  with  him  each 
sunday.”

tell him that gale and i spend our sundays hunting. don't we show up at the end of each one

never crossed my mind until this moment. the woods have always been our place of safety, 
our place beyond the reach of the capitol, where we're free to say what we feel, be who we 
are.  at  least  before  the  games.  if  we've  been  watched  since,  what  have  they  seen?  two 
people hunting, saying treasonous things against the capitol, yes. but not two people in love, 
which seems to be president snow's implication. we are safe on that charge. unless ... unless

it only happened once. it was fast and unexpected, but it did happen. 

after peeta and i got home from the games, it was several weeks before i saw gale alone. 
first there were the obligatory celebrations. a banquet for the victors that only the most high-
ranking  people  were  invited  to.  a  holiday  for  the  whole  district  with  free  food  and 
entertainers  brought  in  from  the  capitol.  parcel  day,  the  first

never happened. 

maybe he was waiting for me to say something. or kiss him back. instead i just pretended 
it had never happened, either. but it had. gale had shattered some invisible barrier between 
us  and,  with  it,  any  hope  i  had  of  resuming  our  old,  uncomplicated  friendship.  whatever  i 
pretended, i could never look at his lips in quite the same way. 

this all  flashes through  my  head  in an  instant as  president snow's eyes  bore  into me on 
the heels of his threat to kill gale. how stupid i've been to think the capitol would just ignore 
me once i'd returned  home!  maybe i didn't know about the potential  uprisings. but i knew 
they were angry with me. instead of acting with the extreme caution the situation called for, 
what  have  i  done?  from  the  president's  point  of  view,  i've  ignored  peeta  and  flaunted  my 
preference for gale's company before the whole district. and by doing so made it

“please don't hurt gale,” i whisper. “he's  just  my  friend. he's  been  my  friend  for  years. 

that's all that's between us. besides, everyone thinks we're cousins now.” 

“i'm only interested in how it affects your dynamic with peeta, thereby affecting the mood 

in the districts,” he says. 

“it will be the same on the tour. i'll be in love with him just as i was,” i say. 

“just as you are,” corrects president snow. 

“just as i am,” i confirm. 

“only you'll have to do even better if the uprisings are to be averted,” he says. “this tour 

will be your only chance to turn things around.” 

“i know. i will. i'll convince everyone in the districts that i wasn't defying the capitol, that 

i was crazy with love,” i say. 

president snow rises and dabs his puffy lips with a napkin. “aim higher in case you fall 

short.”

what i would talk about if i'd been raised in the capitol? maybe my biggest regret would be 
having feathered costumes at my birthday party, too. 

when my hair is done, i find cinna downstairs in the living room, and just the sight of him 
makes me feel more hopeful. he looks the same as always, simple clothes, short brown hair, 
just a hint of gold eyeliner.  we embrace, and i can  barely keep  from spilling out the entire 
episode with president snow. but no, i've decided to tell haymitch first. he'll know best who 
to burden with it. it's so easy to talk to cinna, though. lately we've been speaking a lot on the 
telephone that came with the house. it's sort of a joke, because almost no one else we know 
owns  one.  there's  peeta,  but  obviously  i  don't  call  him.  haymitch  tore  his  out  of  the  wall 
years ago. my  friend  madge, the  mayor's daughter, has a telephone  in  her  house,  but  if we 
want to talk, we do it in person.

, of course, but the pain  is 
so real i take a step back. i squeeze my eyes shut and i don't see prim—i see rue, the twelve-
year-old girl from district 11 who was my ally in the arena. she could fly, birdlike, from tree 
to tree, catching on to the slenderest branches. rue, who i didn't save. who i let die. i picture 
her lying on the ground with the spear still wedged in her stomach... . 

who else will i fail to save from the capitol's vengeance? who else will be dead if i don't 

satisfy president snow? 

i realize cinna's trying to put a coat on me, so i raise my arms. i feel fur, inside and out, 
encasing  me. it's  from  no animal i've ever seen. “ermine,” he tells  me as i stroke the white 
sleeve. leather gloves. a bright red scarf. something furry covers my ears. “you're bringing 
earmuffs back in style.” 

i hate earmuffs, i think. they make it hard to hear, and since i was blasted deaf in one ear 
in the arena, i dislike them  even  more.  after i won, the capitol repaired  my

darkness, thinking about my conversation with haymitch. everything he said was true about 
the capitol's expectations, my future with peeta, even his last comment. of course, i could do 
a lot worse than peeta. that isn't really the point, though, is it? one of the few freedoms we 
have in district 12 is the right to marry who we want or not marry at all. and now even that 
has been taken away from me. i wonder if president snow will insist we have children. if we 
do, they'll have to face the reaping each year. and wouldn't it be something to see the child of 
not one but two victors chosen for the arena? victors' children have been in the ring before. it 
always  causes  a  lot  of  excitement  and  generates  talk  about  how  the  odds  are  not  in  that 
family's  favor.  but  it  happens  too  frequently  to  just  be  about  odds.  gale's  convinced  the

arena, he knew it was better than risking the alternative? i had a taste of that alternative when 
they called prim's name on reaping day and i watched her walk to the stage to her death. but 
as her sister i could take her place, an option forbidden to our mother. 

my mind searches frantically for a way out. i can't let president snow condemn me to this. 
even  if  it  means  taking  my  own  life.  before  that, though,  i'd try  to  run  away.  what  would 
they do if i simply vanished? disappeared into the woods and never came out? could i even 
manage to take everyone i  love with  me, start  a new  life deep  in the wild? highly unlikely 
but not impossible. 

i shake  my  head to clear  it. this  is  not the time to be  making wild escape plans. i  must 

focus on the victory tour. too many people's fates depend on my

full of excitement about the tour. well, everyone but haymitch. he's nursing a hangover and

me again, it's all i can do not to recount the whole story about president snow. but i know 
haymitch wouldn't want me to. i'd better stick to small talk. 

“you  know,  everyone's  always  raving  about  your  paintings.  i  feel  bad  i  haven't  seen

shut and turns on us. “what happened?” he asks. 

peeta relates all that occurred in the square. the whistle, the salute, our hesitation on the 

verandah, the murder of the old man. “what's going on, haymitch?” 

“it will be better coming from you,” haymitch says to me. 

i  don't  agree.  i think  it  will  be  a  hundred  times  worse  coming  from  me.  but  i tell  peeta 
everything as calmly as i can. about president snow, the unrest in the districts. i don't even

jeopardy  because  of  my  trick  with  the  berries.  “i  was  supposed  to  fix  things  on  this  tour.

obviously, all i've done today is. get three people killed, and now everyone in the square will

 might be able to bring you home.” 

“oh” is all i can think to say. 

“you'll see, the choices  you'll  have to make. if we survive this,” says haymitch. “you'll 

learn.” 

well,  i've  learned  one  thing  today.  this  place  is  not  a  larger  version  of  district  12.  our 
fence is unguarded and rarely charged. our peacekeepers are unwelcome but less brutal. our 
hardships evoke  more fatigue than  fury. here  in 11, they suffer  more acutely and  feel  more 
desperation. president snow is right. a spark could be enough to set them ablaze. 

everything  is  happening  too  fast  for  me  to  process  it.  the  warning,  the  shootings,  the 
recognition that i may have set something of great consequence in motion. the whole thing is 
so  improbable.  and  it  would  be  one  thing  if  i  had  planned  to  stir  things  up,  but  given  the 
circumstances ... how on earth did i cause so much trouble?

the train.

what i must do. 

so instead of crumpling to the ground and weeping, i  find  myself  standing up straighter

us throwing them a wedding right here in the capitol?” i pull off girl-almost-catatonic-with-

caesar flickerman asks if the president has a date in mind. 

“oh, before we set a date, we better clear it with katniss's mother,” says the president. the

too  much  light from the city to see the stars here. about  halfway  between the  floor and the

when i just love her compulsive punctuality. we collect cinna and portia, and she escorts us 
around to say good-bye to important people, then herds us to the door.

was  there  only  last  week.  there  are  still  banners  with  my  face  waving  from  the  rooftops. 
below  them,  there's  a  mob  scene.  the  square's  packed  with  screaming  people,  their  faces 
hidden with rags and homemade masks, throwing bricks. buildings burn. peacekeepers shoot 
into the crowd, killing at random. 

i've  never  seen  anything  like  it,  but  i  can  only  be  witnessing  one  thing.  this  is  what 

president snow calls an uprising.

how he feels. didn't i do the same thing to my mother? 

i look in his eyes. his temper can't quite mask the hurt, the sense of betrayal he feels at my 
engagement  to  peeta.  this  will  be  my  last  chance,  this  meeting  today,  to  not  lose  gale 
forever. i could take hours trying to explain, and even then have him refuse me. instead i go 
straight to the heart of my defense. 

“president snow personally threatened to have you killed,” i say. 

gale  raises  his  eyebrows  slightly,  but  there's  no  real  show  of  fear  or  astonishment. 

“anyone else?” 

“well, he didn't actually give me a copy of the list. but it's a good guess it includes both

it's  enough  to  bring  him  to  the  fire.  he  crouches  before  the  hearth  and  warms  himself.

“give  them  back,  then,”  he  says.  he  pulls  on  the  gloves,  flexes  his  fingers,  and  nods  in 

approval. “at least i'll die in comfort.” 

“that's optimistic. of course, you don't know what's happened,” i say. 

“let's have it,” he says. 

i decide to  begin with the night peeta and i were crowned victors of the hunger games, 
and haymitch warned me of the capitol's fury. i tell him about the uneasiness that dogged me 
even once i was back home, president snow's visit to my house, the murders in district 11, 
the  tension  in  the  crowds, the  last-ditch  effort of  the  engagement, the  president's  indication 
that it hadn't been enough, my certainty that i'll have to pay. 

gale never interrupts. while i talk, he tucks the gloves in his pocket and occupies himself

her the situation so she'll keep gale from doing anything foolish. 

my conversation with president snow in the study comes back to me. 

“my  advisors  were  concerned  you  would  be  difficult,  but  you're  not  planning  on  being 

difficult at all, are you?” 

“no.” 

“that's what i told them. i said any girl who goes to such lengths to preserve her life isn't 

going to be interested in throwing it away with both hands.” 

i think of how hard hazelle has worked to keep that family alive. surely she'll be on my 

side in this matter. or won't she? 

it must be getting on toward

's a safe enough place to talk. but i can't seem to get the words out. proposing it to 
gale was such a disaster. i gnaw on my chapped lips. the square gets closer with every step. 
i  may  not have an opportunity again soon. i take a deep  breath and  let the words rush out. 
“peeta, if i asked you to run away from the district with me, would you?” 

peeta takes my arm, bringing me to a stop. he doesn't need to check my face to see if i'm 

serious. “depends on why you're asking.” 

“president snow wasn't convinced by me. there's an uprising in district eight. we have to 

get out,” i say. 

“by 'we' do you mean just you and me? no. who else would be going?” he asks. 

“my family. yours, if they want to come. haymitch, maybe,” i say. 

“what about gale?” he says. 

“i don't know. he might have other plans,” i say. 

peeta shakes his head and gives me a rueful smile. “i bet he does. sure, katniss, i'll go.” 

i feel a slight twinge of hope. “you will?” 

“yeah.

irring at my voice, trying to reach me. the movement causes fresh blood to 

stain his bandages and an agonized sound to come from his mouth. 

“take  her  out,”  says  my  mother.  haymitch  and  peeta  literally  carry  me  from  the  room 
while  i  shout obscenities  at  her. they  pin  me  down  on  a  bed  in  one  of  the  extra  bedrooms 
until i stop fighting. 

while i  lie there, sobbing, tears trying to squeeze out of the slit of  my eye, i  hear peeta 
whisper to haymitch about president snow, about the uprising in district 8. “she wants us all 
to run,” he says, but if haymitch has an opinion on this, he doesn't offer it. 

after a while, my mother comes in and treats my face. then she holds my hand, stroking 

my arm, while haymitch fills her in on what happened with gale. 

“so it's starting again?” she says. “like before?” 

“by the looks of it,” he answers. “who'd have thought we'd ever be sorry to see old cray 

go?”

't follow to suffer and die. this is the 
girl gale met in the woods today. 

no wonder i won the games. no decent person ever does. 

you saved peeta, i think weakly. 

but now i question even that. i knew good and well that my life back in district 12 would 

be unlivable if i let that boy die. 

i  rest  my  head  forward  on  the  edge  of  the  table,  overcome  with  loathing  for  myself. 
wishing  i  had  died  in  the  arena.  wishing  seneca  crane  had  blown  me  to  bits  the  way 
president snow said he should have when i held out the berries. 

the  berries. i realize the answer to who i am  lies  in that handful of poisonous  fruit. if i 
held them out to save peeta because i knew i would be shunned if i came back without him, 
then i am despicable. if i held them out because i loved him, i am still self-centered, although 
forgivable. but if i held them out to defy the capitol, i am someone of worth. the trouble is, 
i don't know exactly what was going on inside me at that moment.

ough, that soon all  she'll  have to treat the patients 
with is snow. 

the  woods,  of  course,  are  forbidden.  absolutely.  no  question.  even  gale  doesn't 

challenge this now. but one morning, 

i do. and it isn't the house full of the sick and dying, the bleeding backs, the gaunt-faced 
children, the  marching boots, or the omnipresent misery that drives  me under the  fence. it's 
the  arrival  of  a  crate  of  wedding  dresses  one  night  with  a  note  from  effie  saying  that 
president snow approved these himself. 

the wedding. is he really planning to go through with it? what, in his twisted brain, will 
that achieve? is it for the benefit of those in the capitol? a wedding was promised, a wedding 
will be given. and then he'll kill us? as a lesson to the districts? i don't know. i can't make 

sense of it. i toss and turn in bed until i can't stand it anymore. i have to get out of here. at 
least for a few hours. 

my hands dig around in my closet until i find the insulated wi

practically all anyone's talked about since—” 

“i know. i know. since i pulled out those berries,” i say tiredly. 

i hardly notice the walk home even though a wet snow begins to fall. my mind is spinning 
with  new  information  about  the  uprising  in  district  8  and  the  unlikely  but  tantalizing 
possibility of district 13. 

listening to bonnie and twill confirmed one thing: president snow has been playing me 
for a fool. all the kisses and endearments in the world couldn't have derailed the momentum 
building  up  in  district  8.  yes,  my  holding  out the  berries  had  been  the  spark,  but  i  had  no 
way to control the fire. he must have  known that. so why visit my home, why order me to 
persuade the crowd of my love for peeta? 

it was obviously a ploy to distract me and keep me from doing anything else inflammatory 
in the districts. and to entertain the people in the

y will. and there's a part of me that's worried, 
too, because i'm not sure it's just a coincidence, the power coming on the very day i return to 
the woods. 

i thought no one saw me sneak under the fence, but who knows? there are always eyes for 
hire.  someone  reported  gale  kissing  me  in  that  very  spot.  still,  that  was  in  daylight  and 
before  i  was  more  careful  about  my  behavior.  could  there  be  surveillance  cameras?  i've 
wondered about this before. is this the way president snow knows about the kiss? it was dark 
when i went under and my face was bundled in a scarf. but the list of suspects likely to be 
trespassing into the woods is probably very short. 

my eyes peer through the trees, past the fence, into the meadow. all i can see is the wet 
snow illuminated here and there by the light from the windows on the edge of the seam. no 
peacekeepers in sight, no signs i am being hunted. whether thread knows i left the district 
today  or  not,  i  realize  my  course  of

em  ends,  and  president  snow  begins  to  speak,  to  remind  us  all  of  the  dark  days 
from which the hunger games were born. when the laws for the games were laid out, they 
dictated that every twenty-five years the anniversary would be marked by a quarter quell. it 
would call for a glorified version of the games to make fresh the memory of those killed by 
the districts' rebellion. 

these words could not be more pointed, since i suspect several districts are rebelling right 

now. 

president snow goes on to tell us what happened in the previous quarter quells. “on the 
twenty-fifth anniversary, as a reminder to the rebels that their children were dying because of 
their choice to initiate violence, every district was made to hold an election and vote on the 
tributes who would represent it.” 

i wonder how that would have felt. picking the kids who had to go. it is worse, i think, to 

be turned over by your own neighbors than have your name drawn from the reaping ball. 

“on the

there's some kind of sheeting, the kind they put down when they paint. i pull it over me 
like  a  blanket.  in  the  distance,  someone  is  calling  my  name.  but  at  the  moment,  i  excuse 
myself from thinking about even those i love most. i think only of me. and what lies ahead. 

the  sheeting's  stiff  but  holds  warmth.  my  muscles  relax,  my  heart  rate  slows.  i  see  the 
wooden box in the little boy's hands, president snow drawing out the yellowed envelope. is it 
possible that this was really the quarter quell written down seventy-five years ago? it seems 
unlikely. it's just too perfect an answer for the troubles that face the capitol today. getting rid 
of me and subduing the districts all in one neat little package. 

i  hear  president  snow's  voice  in  my  head. “on  the  seventy-fifth  anniversary,  as  a

what are the livestock keepers from district 10, who are dressed as cows, doing with flaming 
belts? broiling themselves? pathetic. 

peeta and i, on the other hand, are so mesmerizing with our ever-changing coal costumes 
that most of the other tributes are staring at us. we seem particularly riveting to the pair from 
district  6,  who  are  known  morphling  addicts.  both  bone  thin,  with  sagging  yellowish  skin. 
they can't tear their overlarge eyes away, even  when president snow begins to speak  from 
his balcony, welcoming us all to the quell. the anthem plays, and as we make our final trip 
around the circle, am i wrong? or do i see the president fixated on me as well? 

peeta  and  i  wait  until  the  doors  of  the  training  center  have  closed  behind  us  to  relax. 
cinna  and  portia  are  there,  pleased  with  our  performance,  and  haymitch  has  made  an

in punishment for him. so we just stare into each other's eyes. darius, now a mute slave; me, 
now headed to death. what would we say, anyway? that we're sorry for the other's lot? that 
we ache for the other's pain? that we're glad we had the chance to know each other? 

no, darius shouldn't be glad he knew me. if i had been there to stop thread, he wouldn't 
have stepped forward to save gale. wouldn't be an avox. and more specifically, wouldn't be 
my avox, because president snow has so obviously had him placed here for my benefit. 

i twist  my  wrist  from  haymitch's  grasp  and  head  down to  my  old  bedroom,  locking  the 
door behind me. i sit on the side of my bed, elbows on my knees, forehead on my fists, and 
watch  my  glowing  suit  in  the  darkness,  imagining  i  am  in  my  old  home  in  district  12, 
huddled beside the fire. it slowly fades back to black as the power pack dies out.

gloved  hands  carry  out the  bloody  dissection  in  darius's  mouth.  then  i'm  at  a  party  where 
everyone wears  masks and  someone with a  flicking, wet tongue, who i suppose  is  finnick, 
stalks me, but when he catches me and pulls off his mask, it's president snow, and his puffy 
lips  are  dripping  in  bloody  saliva.  finally  i'm  back  in  the  arena,  my  own  tongue  as  dry  as 
sandpaper, while i try to reach a pool of water that recedes every time i'm about to touch it. 

when i wake, i stumble to the bathroom and gulp water from the faucet until i can hold no 
more.  i  strip  off  my  sweaty  clothes  and  fall  back  into  bed,  naked,  and  somehow  find  sleep 
again.

t even if that happens, everyone will know we've gone out fighting, right?” peeta asks. 

“everyone  will,”  i  reply.  and  for  the  first  time,  i  distance  myself  from  the  personal 
tragedy that has consumed me since they announced the quell. i remember the old man they 
shot  in  district  11,  and  bonnie  and  twill,  and  the  rumored  uprisings.  yes,  everyone  in  the 
districts  will  be  watching  me  to  see  how  i  handle  this  death  sentence,  this  final  act  of 
president snow's dominance. they will  be  looking  for some sign that their battles  have  not 
been  in  vain. if i can  make  it clear that  i'm still defying the capitol right up to the end, the 
capitol will have killed me ... but not my spirit. what better way to give hope to the rebels? 

the beauty of this idea is that my decision to keep peeta alive at the expense of my own 
life is itself an act of defiance. a refusal to play the hunger games by the capitol's rules. my 
private agenda dovetails comp

my prep team. my foolish, shallow, affectionate pets, with their obsessions with feathers 
and  parties,  nearly  break  my  heart  with  their  good-bye.  it's  certain  from  venia's  last  words 
that  we  all  know  i  won't  be  returning. does  the  whole  world  know  it? i  wonder.  i  look  at 
cinna. he knows, certainly. but as he promised, there's no danger of tears from him. 

“so, what am i wearing tonight?” i ask, eyeing the garment bag that holds my dress. 

“president snow put in the dress order himself,” says cinna. he unzips the bag, revealing 
one of the wedding dresses i wore for the photo shoot. heavy white silk with a low neckline 
and  tight  waist  and  sleeves  that  fall  from  my  wrists  to  the  floor.  and  pearls.  everywhere 
pearls. stitched  into the dress and  in ropes at  my  throat  and forming the crown for the veil. 
“even  though  they  announced  the  quarter  quell  the  night  of  the  photo  shoot,  people  still

 favorite  dress,  and  this  was  the  winner.  the  president  says  you're  to  wear  it 
tonight. our objections were ignored.” 

i rub a bit of the silk between my fingers, trying to figure out president snow's reasoning. 
i suppose since i was the greatest offender, my pain and loss and humiliation should be in the 
brightest spotlight. this, he thinks, will make that clear. it's so barbaric, the president turning 
my  bridal  gown  into  my  shroud,  that  the  blow  strikes  home,  leaving  me  with  a  dull  ache 
inside. “well, it'd be a shame to waste such a pretty dress” is all i say. 

cinna  helps  me  carefully  into  the  gown.  as  it  settles  on  my  shoulders,  they  can't  help

“i'm  sure caesar will  ask  you.  and  if  he doesn't,  you suggest  it  yourself. only  not right 

away. save it for your big finale,” cinna instructs me. 

“you give me a signal so i know when,” i say. 

“all  right.  any  plans  for  your  interview?  i  know  haymitch  left  you  two  to  your  own 

devices,” he says. 

“no, this year i'm just winging it. the funny thing is, i'm not nervous at all.” and i'm not. 

however much president snow may hate me, this capitol audience is mine. 

we meet up with effie, haymitch, portia, and peeta at the elevator. peeta's in an elegant 
tuxedo and white gloves. the sort of thing grooms wear to get married in, here in the capitol. 

back  home  everything  is  so  much  simpler.  a  woman  usually  rents  a  white  dress  that's 
been worn hundreds of times. the man wears something clean that's not mining clothes. they 
fill  out  some  forms  at  the  justice  building  and  are  assigned  a

a  bow!” 
caesar gestures for cinna to rise. he does, and makes a small, gracious bow. and suddenly i 
am so afraid for him. what has he done? something terribly dangerous. an act of rebellion in 
itself. and he's done it for me. i remember his words ... 

“don't worry. i always channel my emotions into my work. that way i don't hurt anyone 

but myself.” 

...  and  i'm  afraid  he  has  hurt  himself  beyond  repair.  the  significance  of  my  fiery 

transformation will not be lost on president snow. 

the audience, who's been stunned into silence, breaks into wild applause. i can barely hear 
the buzzer that indicates that my three minutes are up. caesar thanks me and i go back to my 
seat, my dress now feeling lighter than air. 

as i pass peeta, who's headed for his interview, he doesn't meet my eyes. i take my seat 
carefully,  but aside  from the puffs of smoke  here and there, i seem unharmed, so i turn my 
attention to him.

a chain around his neck. my mockingjay has been engraved on it. “is this your token?” i ask. 

“yes. do you mind that i used your mockingjay? i wanted us to match,” he says. 

“no,  of  course  i  don't  mind.”  i  force  a  smile.  peeta  showing  up  in  the  arena  wearing  a 
mockingjay  is  both  a  blessing  and  a  curse.  on  the  one  hand,  it  should  give  a  boost  to  the 
rebels in the district. on the other, it's hard to imagine president snow will overlook it, and 
that makes the job of keeping peeta alive harder. 

“so you want to make camp here, then?” finnick asks. 

“i  don't  think  that's  an  option,”  peeta  answers.  “staying  here.  with  no  water.  no 

protection. i feel all right, really. if we could just go slowly.” 

“slowly would be better than not at all.” finnick helps peeta to his feet while i pull myself 
together. since i got up this morning i've watched cinna beaten to a pulp, landed in another

“what's it do, die?” asks johanna. 

“it stops singing first. that's when you should get out. but if the air's too bad, it dies, yes. 
and so do  you.” i don't want to talk about dying songbirds. they  bring up thoughts of  my 
father's  death  and  rue's  death  and  maysilee  donner's  death  and  my  mother  inheriting  her 
songbird.  oh,  great,  and  now  i'm  thinking  of  gale,  deep  down  in  that  horrible  mine,  with 
president snow's threat hanging over his head. so easy to make it look like an accident down 
there. a silent canary, a spark, and nothing more. 

i go back to imagining killing the president. 

despite her annoyance at wiress, johanna's as happy as i've seen her in the arena. while 
i'm adding to my stock of arrows, she pokes around until she comes up with a pair of lethal-
looking axes. it seems an odd choice until i see her throw one with such force it sticks in the

can't  think  why  the  sky's  being  bombed  until  i  realize  the  gamemakers  are  shooting  off 
fireworks  up  there,  while  the  real  destruction  occurs  on  the  ground.  just  in  case  it's  not 
enough  fun watching the obliteration of the arena and the remaining tributes. or perhaps to 
illuminate our gory ends. 

will they  let anyone survive? will there be a victor of the seventy-fifth hunger games? 
maybe not. after all, what is this quarter quell but ... what was it president snow read from 
the card? 

“...  a  reminder  to  the  rebels  that  even  the  strongest  among  them  cannot  overcome  the 

power of the capitol...” 

not even the strongest of the strong will triumph. perhaps they  never  intended to have a 

victor in these games at all. or perhaps my final act of rebellion forced their hand. 

i'm sorry, peeta, i think. i'm sorry i couldn't save you. save him? more likely i stole  his 
last chance at life, condemned him, by destroying the force field. ma

he heart to 
tell me. i feel crazy enough. 

“i wish she was dead,” he says. “i wish they were all dead and we were, too. it would be 

best.” 

well, there's no good response to that. i can hardly dispute it since i was walking around 
with a syringe to kill peeta when i found them. do i really want him dead? what i want ... 
what  i  want  is  to  have  him  back.  but  i'll  never  get  him  back  now. even  if  the  rebel  forces 
could somehow overthrow the capitol, you can be sure president snow's last act would be to 
cut peeta's throat. no. i will never get him back. so then dead is best. 

but  will  peeta  know  that or  will  he  keep  fighting?  he's  so  strong  and  such  a  good  liar. 
does  he  think  he  has  a  chance  of  surviving?  does  he  even  care  if  he  does?  he  wasn't 
planning on it, anyway. he had already signed off on life. maybe, if he knows i was rescued, 
he's even happy. feels he fulfilled his mission to keep me alive. 

i think i hate him even more th
