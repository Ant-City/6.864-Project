Uncle Rondo - 
                A mentally and emotionally scarred World War I veteran. Uncle Rondo wears Stella-Rondo's flesh-colored kimono and, as is his habit every Fourth of July, consumes an entire bottle of a liquid prescription medicine and all but loses consciousness for hours. Temperamental and easily provoked, he lashes out in cruel ways when he feels he is being threatened.
