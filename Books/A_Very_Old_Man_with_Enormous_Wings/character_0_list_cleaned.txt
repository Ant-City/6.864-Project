                an [CHARACTER] with wings who appears in pelayo and elisenda's yard one day. filthy and bedraggled, the [CHARACTER] speaks a foreign language that no one can understand. his wings and unintelligible language prompts some people to believe that he's a fallen angel and the church to believe he's a norwegian, even though he seems oblivious to nearly everything that happens around him. by the end of the story, the [CHARACTER] has recovered enough to fly away, exiting pelayo's and elisenda's lives as suddenly as he'd entered.
