“have you confessed yourself, brother,” said the templar, “and have you
heard mass this morning, that you peril your life so frankly?”

“i am fitter to meet death than thou art” answered the disinherited
knight; for by this name the stranger had recorded himself in the books
of the tourney.

“then take your place in the lists,” said bois-guilbert, “and look your
last upon the sun; for this night thou shalt sleep in paradise.”

“gramercy for thy courtesy,” replied the disinherited knight, “and to
requite it, i advise thee to take a fresh horse and a new lance, for by
my honour you will need both.”

having expressed himself thus confidently, he reined his horse backward
down the slope which he had ascended, and compelled him in the same
manner to move backward through the lists, till he reached the
northern extremity, where he remained stationary, in expectation of his
antagonist. this feat of horsemanship again attracted the applause of
the multitude.

qualities which they had since exchanged for the arrogance and wealth
that finally occasioned their suppression. bois-guilbert’s new shield
bore a raven in full flight, holding in its claws a skull, and bearing
the motto, “gare le corbeau”.

when the two champions stood opposed to each other at the two
extremities of the lists, the public expectation was strained to the
highest pitch. few augured the possibility that the encounter could
terminate well for the disinherited knight, yet his courage and
gallantry secured the general good wishes of the spectators.

the trumpets had no sooner given the signal, than the champions vanished
from their posts with the speed of lightning, and closed in the centre
of the lists with the shock of a thunderbolt. the lances burst into
shivers up to the very grasp, and it seemed at the moment that both
knights had fallen, for the shock had made each horse recoil backwards
upon its haunches. the address of the riders recovered their stee

wed, that the combatants and their
horses might recover breath, prince john with his truncheon signed to
the trumpets to sound the onset. the champions a second time sprung from
their stations, and closed in the centre of the lists, with the same
speed, the same dexterity, the same violence, but not the same equal
fortune as before.

in this second encounter, the templar aimed at the centre of his
antagonist’s shield, and struck it so fair and forcibly, that his spear
went to shivers, and the disinherited knight reeled in his saddle.
on the other hand, that champion had, in the beginning of his career,
directed the point of his lance towards bois-guilbert’s shield, but,
changing his aim almost in the moment of encounter, he addressed it
to the helmet, a mark more difficult to hit, but which, if attained,
rendered the shock more irresistible. fair and true he hit the norman on
the visor, where his lance’s point kept hold of the bars. yet, even at
this disadvantage, the templar sustained his high rep

utation; and had
not the girths of his saddle burst, he might not have been unhorsed. as
it chanced, however, saddle, horse, and man, rolled on the ground under
a cloud of dust.

to extricate himself from the stirrups and fallen steed, was to the
templar scarce the work of a moment; and, stung with madness, both at
his disgrace and at the acclamations with which it was hailed by the
spectators, he drew his sword and waved it in defiance of his conqueror.
the disinherited knight sprung from his steed, and also unsheathed his
sword. the marshals of the field, however, spurred their horses between
them, and reminded them, that the laws of the tournament did not, on the
present occasion, permit this species of encounter.

“we shall meet again, i trust,” said the templar, casting a resentful
glance at his antagonist; “and where there are none to separate us.”

“if we do not,” said the disinherited knight, “the fault shall not be
mine. on foot or horseback, wi

alike ready to encounter thee.”

more and angrier words would have been exchanged, but the marshals,
crossing their lances betwixt them, compelled them to separate. the
disinherited knight returned to his first station, and bois-guilbert
to his tent, where he remained for the rest of the day in an agony of
despair.

without alighting from his horse, the conqueror called for a bowl of
wine, and opening the beaver, or lower part of his helmet, announced
that he quaffed it, “to all true english hearts, and to the confusion of
foreign tyrants.” he then commanded his trumpet to sound a defiance
to the challengers, and desired a herald to announce to them, that he
should make no el

ined a slight but decisive advantage. both knights broke
their lances fairly, but front-de-boeuf, who lost a stirrup in the
encounter, was adjudged to have the disadvantage.

in the stranger’s third encounter with sir philip malvoisin, he was
equally successful; striking that baron so forcibly on the casque, that
the laces of the helmet broke, and malvoisin, only saved from falling by
being unhelmeted, was declared vanquished like his companions.

in his fourth combat with de grantmesnil, the disinherited knight showed
as much courtesy as he had hitherto evinced courage and dexterity. de
grantmesnil’s horse, which was young and violent, reared and plunged
in the course of the career so as to disturb the rider’s aim, and the
stranger, declining to take the advantage which this accident afforded
him, raised his lance, and passing his antagonist without touching
him, wheeled his horse and rode back again to his own end of the lists,
offering his antagonist, by a herald, the chance of a second encounte

william de wyvil and stephen de martival, the marshals of the field,
were the first to offer their congratulations to the victor, praying
him, at the same time, to suffer his helmet to be unlaced, or, at least,
that he would raise his visor ere they conducted him to receive
the prize of the day’s tourney from the hands of prince john. the
disinherited knight, with all knightly courtesy, declined their request,
alleging, that he could not at this time suffer his face to be seen, for
reasons which he had assigned to the heralds when he entered the lists.
the marshals were perfectly satisfied by this reply; for amidst the
frequent and capricious vows by which knights were accustomed to bind
themselves in the days of chivalry, there were none more common than
those by which they engaged to remain incognito for a certain space, or
until some particular

adventure was achieved. the marshals, therefore,
pressed no farther into the mystery of the disinherited knight, but,
announcing to prince john the conqueror’s desire to remain unknown, they
requested permission to bring him before his grace, in order that he
might receive the reward of his valour.

john’s curiosity was excited by the mystery observed by the stranger;
and, being already displeased with the issue of the tournament, in which
the challengers whom he favoured had been successively defeated by one
knight, he answered haughtily to the marshals, “by the light of our
lady’s brow, this sa

o much injured, and to whom he was so much indebted,
had suddenly arrived in his native kingdom, even the distinctions
pointed out by fitzurse did not altogether remove the prince’s
apprehensions; and while, with a short and embarrassed eulogy upon his
valour, he caused to be delivered to him the war-horse assigned as the
prize, he trembled lest from the barred visor of the mailed form before
him, an answer might be returned, in the deep and awful accents of
richard the lion-hearted.

but the disinherited knight spoke not a word in reply to the compliment
of the prince, which he only acknowledged with a profound obeisance.

the horse was led into the lists by two grooms richly dressed, the
animal itself being fully accoutred with the richest war-furniture;
which, however, scarcely added to the value of the noble creature in the
eyes of those who were judges. laying one hand upon the pommel of the
saddle, the disinherited knight vaulted at once upon the back of the
steed without making use of the stirru

the prince accordingly made a sign with his truncheon, as the knight
passed him in his second career around the lists. the knight turned
towards the throne, and, sinking his lance, until the point was within
a foot of the ground, remained motionless, as if expecting john’s
commands; while all admired the sudden dexterity with which he instantly
reduced his fiery steed from a state of violent emotion and high
excitation to the stillness of an equestrian statue.

“sir disinherited knight,” said prince john, “since that is the only
title by which we can address you, it is now your duty, as well as
privilege, to name the fair lady, who, as queen of honour and of love,
is to preside over next day’s festival. if, as a stranger in our land,
you should require the aid of other judgment to guide your own, we
can only say that alicia, the daughter of our gallant knight waldemar
fitzurse, has at our court been long held the first in beauty as in

around him his own indecent and unacceptable jest respecting the jewess
rebecca; he was desirous of conciliating alicia’s father waldemar,
of whom he stood in awe, and who had more than once shown himself
dissatisfied during the course of the day’s proceedings. he had also a
wish to establish himself in the good graces of the lady; for john was
at least as licentious in his pleasures as profligate in his ambition.
but besides all these reasons, he was desirous to raise up against
the disinherited knight (towards whom he already entertained a strong
dislike) a powerful enemy in the person of waldemar fitzurse, who was
likely, he thought, highly to resent the injury done to his daughter, in
case, as was not unlikely, the victor should make another choice.

and so indeed it proved. for the disinherited knight passed the gallery
close to that of the prince, in which the lady alicia was seated in the
full pride of triumphant beauty, and, pacing forwards as slowly as he
had hitherto rode swiftly aro

 but, as the
wardour manuscript says these were fair ones of ten years standing, it
may be supposed that, having had their full share of such vanities, they
were willing to withdraw their claim, in order to give a fair chance to
the rising beauties of the age.

at length the champion paused beneath the balcony in which the lady
rowena was placed, and the expectation of the spectators was excited to
the utmost.

it must be owned, that if an interest displayed in his success could
have bribed the disinherited knight, the part of the lists before which
he paused had merited his predilection. cedric the saxon, overjoyed at
the discomfiture of the templar, and still more so at the miscarriage of
his two malevolent neighbours, front-de-boeuf and malvoisin, had, with
his body half stretched over the balcony, accompanied the victor in each
course, not with his eyes only, but with his whole heart and soul. the
lady rowena had watched the progress of the day with equal attention,
though without openly betraying th

e same intense interest. even the
unmoved athelstane had shown symptoms of shaking off his apathy, when,
calling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he quaffed it to the health
of the disinherited knight. another group, stationed under the gallery
occupied by the saxons, had shown no less interest in the fate of the
day.

“father abraham!” said isaac of york, when the first course was run
betwixt the templar and the disinherited knight, “how fiercely that
gentile rides! ah, the good horse that was brought all the long way
from barbary, he takes no more care of him than if he were a wild ass’s
colt--and the noble armour, that was worth so many zecchins to joseph
pareira, the armourer of milan, besides seventy in the hundred of
profits, he cares for it as little as if he had found it in the
highways!”

“if he risks his own person and limbs, father,” said rebecca, “in doing

g of the amorites, fell before the sword of our

the same anxiety did the worthy jew display during every course that was
run, seldom failing to hazard a hasty calculation concerning the value
of the horse and armour which was forfeited to the champion upon each
new success. there had been therefore no small interest taken in the
success of the disinherited knight, by those who occupied the part of
the lists before which he now paused.

whether from indecision, or some other motive of hesitation, the
champion of the day remained stationary for more than a minute, while
the eyes of the silent audience were riveted upon his motions; and then,
gradually and gracefully sinking the point of his lance, he deposited
the coronet which it supported at the feet of the fair rowena. the
trumpets instantly sounded, while the heralds proclaimed the lady rowena

a strong guard of men-at-arms, renewed at intervals, from two hours to

the disinherited knight had no sooner reached his pavilion, than squires
and pages in abundance tendered their services to disarm him, to bring
fresh attire, and to offer him the refreshment of the bath. their zeal
on this occasion was perhaps sharpened by curiosity, since every one
desired to know who the knight was that had gained so many laurels, yet
had refused, even at the command of prince john, to lift his visor or
to name his name. but their officious inquisitiveness was not gratified.
the disinherited knight

having his head and face half-buried
in a norman bonnet made of black fur, seemed to affect the incognito
as much as his master. all others being excluded from the tent, this
attendant relieved his master from the more burdensome parts of his
armour, and placed food and wine before him, which the exertions of the
day rendered very acceptable.

the knight had scarcely finished a hasty meal, ere his menial announced
to him that five men, each leading a barbed steed, desired to speak with
him. the disinherited knight had exchanged his armour for the long robe
usually worn by those of his condition, which, being furnished with a
hood, concealed the features, when such was the pleasure of the
wearer, almost as completely as the visor of the helmet itself, but the
twilight, which was now fast darkening, would of itself have rendered
a disguise unnecessary, unless to persons to whom the face of an
individual chanced to be particularly well known.

the disinherited knight, therefore, stept boldly forth to the fr

 foremost of these men, “i,
baldwin de oyley, squire to the redoubted knight brian de bois-guilbert,
make offer to you, styling yourself, for the present, the disinherited
knight, of the horse and armour used by the said brian de bois-guilbert
in this day’s passage of arms, leaving it with your nobleness to retain
or to ransom the same, according to your pleasure; for such is the law
of arms.”

the other squires repeated nearly the same formula, and then stood to
await the decision of the disinherited knight.

“to you four, sirs,” replied the knight, addressing those who had last
spoken, “and to your honourable and valiant masters, i have one common
reply. commend me to the noble knights, your masters, and say, i should
do ill to deprive them of steeds and arms which can never be used by
braver cavaliers.--i would i could here end my message to these
gallant knights; but being, as i term myself, in truth and earnest, the
disinherited, i must be thus far bound to your masters, that they will,

of their courtesy, be pleased to ransom their steeds and armour, since
that which i wear i can hardly term mine own.”

“we stand commissioned, each of us,” answered the squire of reginald
front-de-boeuf, “to offer a hundred zecchins in ransom of these horses
and suits of armour.”

“it is sufficient,” said the disinherited knight. “half the sum
my present necessities compel me to accept; of the remaining half,
distribute one moiety among yourselves, sir squires, and divide the
other half betwixt the heralds and the pursuivants, and minstrels, and
attendants.”

the squires, with cap in hand, and low reverences, expressed their deep
sense of a courtesy and generosity not often practised, at least upon a
scale so extensive. the disinherited knight then addressed his discourse
to baldwin, the squire of brian de bois-gui

but
rather as one with whom i stand upon terms of mortal defiance.”

“my master,” answered baldwin, “knows how to requite scorn with scorn,
and blows with blows, as well as courtesy with courtesy. since you
disdain to accept from him any share of the ransom at which you have
rated the arms of the other knights, i must leave his armour and his
horse here, being well assured that he will never deign to mount the one
nor wear the other.”

“you have spoken well, good squire,” said the disinherited knight,
“well and boldly, as it beseemeth him to speak who answers for an absent
master. leave not, however, the horse and armour here. restore them to
thy master; or, if he scorns to accept them, retain them, good friend,
for thine own use. so far as they are mine, i bestow them upon you
freely.”

baldwin made a deep obeisance, and retired with his companions; and the
disinherited knight entered the pavilion.

“thus far, gurth,” said he, addressing his attendant, “the reputation of
english

chivalry hath not suffered in my hands.”

“and i,” said gurth, “for a saxon swineherd, have not ill played the
personage of a norman squire-at-arms.”

“yea, but,” answered the disinherited knight, “thou hast ever kept me in
anxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee.”

“tush!” said gurth, “i fear discovery from none, saving my playfellow,
wamba the jester, of whom i could never discover whether he were most
knave or fool. yet i could scarce choose but laugh, when my old master
passed so near to me, dreaming all the while that gurth was keeping his
porkers many a mile off, in the thickets and swamps of rotherwood. if i
am discovered---”

“enough,” said the dis

h, “that i will not do.”

“how, knave,” replied his master, “wilt thou not obey my commands?”

“so they be honest, reasonable, and christian commands,” replied gurth;
“but this is none of these. to suffer the jew to pay himself would be
dishonest, for it would be cheating my master; and unreasonable, for it
were the part of a fool; and unchristian, since it would be plundering a
believer to enrich an infidel.”

“see him contented, however, thou stubborn varlet,” said the
disinherited knight.

“i will do so,” said gurth, taking the bag under his cloak, and leaving
the apartment; “and it will go hard,” he muttered, “but i content him
with one-half of his own asking.” so saying, he departed, and left the
disinherited knight to his own perplexed ruminations; which, upon more
accounts than it is now possible to communicate to the reader, were of a
nature peculiarly agitating and painful.

we must now change the scene to the village of ashby, or rather to a

“as much as my name is to thee,” replied isaac; “for without knowing
thine, how can i hold intercourse with thee?”

“easily,” answered gurth; “i, being to pay money, must know that i
deliver it to the right person; thou, who are to receive it, will not, i
think, care very greatly by whose hands it is delivered.”

“o,” said the jew, “you are come to pay moneys?--holy father abraham!
that altereth our relation to each other. and from whom dost thou bring
it?”

“from the disinherited knight,” said gurth, “victor in this day’s
tournament. it is the price of the armour supplied to him by kirjath
jairam of leicester, on thy recommendation. the steed is restored to thy
stable. i desire to know the amount of the sum which i am to pay for the
armour.”

“i said he was a good youth!” exclaimed isaac with joyful exultation. “a
cup of wine will do thee no harm,” he added, filling and handing to the
swineherd a richer drought than gurth had ever before tasted. “and how

“thou art an honest fellow,” replied the robber, “i warrant thee; and we
worship not st nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirty zecchins may yet
escape, if thou deal uprightly with us. meantime render up thy trust
for a time.” so saying, he took from gurth’s breast the large leathern
pouch, in which the purse given him by rebecca was enclosed, as well as
the rest of the zecchins, and then continued his interrogation.--“who is
thy master?”

“the disinherited knight,” said gurth.

“whose good lance,” replied the robber, “won the prize in to-day’s
tourney? what is his name and lineage?”

“it is his pleasure,” answered gurth, “that they be concealed; and from
me, assuredly, you will learn nought of them.”

“what is thine own name and lineage?”

“to tell that,” said gurth, “might reveal my master’s.”

“thou art a saucy groom,” said the robber, “but of that anon. how comes

against our revenge.”

“good night to you, kind sirs,” said gurth; “i shall remember your
orders, and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a safer and an
honester trade.”

thus they parted, the outlaws returning in the direction from whence
they had come, and gurth proceeding to the tent of his master, to whom,
notwithstanding the injunction he had received, he communicated the
whole adventures of the evening.

the disinherited knight was filled with astonishment, no less at the
generosity of rebecca, by which, however, he resolved he would not
profit, than that of the robbers, to whose profession such a quality
seemed totally foreign. his course of reflections upon these singular
circumstances was, however, interrupted by the necessity for taking
repose, which the fatigue of the preceding day, and the propriety
of refreshing himself for the morrow’s encounter, rendered alike
indispensable.

the knight, therefore, stretche

the marshals and their attendants appeared next on the field, together
with the heralds, for the purpose of receiving the names of the knights
who intended to joust, with the side which each chose to espouse. this
was a necessary precaution, in order to secure equality betwixt the two
bodies who should be opposed to each other.

according to due formality, the disinherited knight was to be considered
as leader of the one body, while brian de bois-guilbert, who had been
rated as having done second-best in the preceding day, was named first
champion of the other band. those who had concurred in the challenge
adhered to his party of course, excepting only ralph de vipont, whom his
fall had rendered unfit so soon to put on his armour. there was no want
of distinguished and noble candidates to fill up the ranks on either
side.

in fact, although the general tournament, in wh

 the assent of cedric and her other friends. it
had therefore been with smothered displeasure that the proud though
indolent lord of coningsburgh beheld the victor of the preceding day
select rowena as the object of that honour which it became his privilege
to confer. in order to punish him for a preference which seemed to
interfere with his own suit, athelstane, confident of his strength,
and to whom his flatterers, at least, ascribed great skill in arms, had
determined not only to deprive the disinherited knight of his powerful
succour, but, if an opportunity should occur, to make him feel the
weight of his battle-axe.

de bracy, and other knights attached to prince john, in obedience to
a hint from him, had joined the party of the challengers, john being
desirous to secure, if possible, the victory to that side. on the
other hand, many other knights, both english and norman, natives and
strangers, took part against the challengers, the more readily that
the opposite band was to be led by so distinguis

disinherited knight had approved himself.

as soon as prince john observed that the destined queen of the day had
arrived upon the field, assuming that air of courtesy which sat well
upon him when he was pleased to exhibit it, he rode forward to meet
her, doffed his bonnet, and, alighting from his horse, assisted the lady
rowena from her saddle, while his followers uncovered at the same time,
and one of the most distinguished dismounted to hold her palfrey.

“it is thus,” said prince john, “that we set the d

every pause was heard the voice of the heralds, exclaiming,
“fight on, brave knights! man dies, but glory lives!--fight on--death
is better than defeat!--fight on, brave knights!--for bright eyes behold
your deeds!”

amid the varied fortunes of the combat, the eyes of all endeavoured to
discover the leaders of each band, who, mingling in the thick of the
fight, encouraged their companions both by voice and example. both
displayed great feats of gallantry, nor did either bois-guilbert or the
disinherited knight find in the ranks opposed to them a champion who
could be termed their unquestioned match. they repeatedly endeavoured to
single out each other, spurred by mutual animosity, and aware that the
fall of either leader might be considered as decisive of victory. such,
however, was the crowd and confusion, that, during the earlier part
of the conflict, their efforts to meet were unavailing, and they were
repeatedly separated by the eagerness of their followers, each of whom
was anxious to win honour

, by measuring his strength against the leader
of the opposite party.

but when the field became thin by the numbers on either side who had
yielded themselves vanquished, had been compelled to the extremity
of the lists, or been otherwise rendered incapable of continuing the
strife, the templar and the disinherited knight at length encountered
hand to hand, with all the fury that mortal animosity, joined to rivalry
of honour, could inspire. such was the address of each in parrying
and striking, that the spectators broke forth into a unanimous and
involuntary shout, expressive of their delight and admiration.

but at this moment the party of the disinherited knight had the worst;
the gigantic arm of front-de-boeuf on the one flank, and the ponderous
strength of athelstane on the other, bearing down and dispersing

those immediately exposed to them. finding themselves freed from their
immediate antagonists, it seems to have occurred to both these knights
at the same instant, that they would render the most decisive advantage
to their party, by aiding the templar in his contest with his rival.
turning their horses, therefore, at the same moment, the norman spurred
against the disinherited knight on the one side, and the saxon on the
other. it was utterly impossible that the object of this unequal and
unexpected assault could have sustained it, had he not been warned by a
general cry from the spectators, who could not but take interest in one
exposed to such disadvantage.

“beware! beware! sir disinherited!” was shouted so universally, that
the knight became aware of his danger; and, striking a full blow at the
templar, he reined back his steed in the same moment, so as to escape
th

e charge of athelstane and front-de-boeuf. these knights, therefore,
their aim being thus eluded, rushed from opposite sides betwixt the
object of their attack and the templar, almost running their horses
against each other ere they could stop their career. recovering their
horses however, and wheeling them round, the whole three pursued their
united purpose of bearing to the earth the disinherited knight.

nothing could have saved him, except the remarkable strength and
activity of the noble horse which he had won on the preceding day.

this stood him in the more stead, as the horse of bois-guilbert was
wounded, and those of front-de-boeuf and athelstane were both tired with
the weight of their gigantic masters, clad in complete armour, and with
the preceding exertions of the day. the masterly horsemanship of the
disinherited knight, and the activity of the noble animal which he
mounted, enable

prince john implored him with one voice to throw down his warder, and to
save so brave a knight from the disgrace of being overcome by odds.

“not i, by the light of heaven!” answered prince john; “this
same springald, who conceals his name, and despises our proffered
hospitality, hath already gained one prize, and may now afford to
let others have their turn.” as he spoke thus, an unexpected incident
changed the fortune of the day.

there was among the ranks of the disinherited knight a champion in
black armour, mounted on a black horse, large of size, tall, and to all
appearance powerful and strong, like the rider by whom he was mounted.
this knight, who bore on his shield no device of any kind, had hitherto
evinced very little interest in the event of the fight, beating off with
seeming ease those combatants who attacked him, but neither pursuing
his advantages, nor himself assailing any one. in short, he had hitherto
acted the part rather of a spectator than of a party in
 
 ___________________________
 
 the tournament,
a circumstance which procured him among the spectators the name of “le
noir faineant”, or the black sluggard.

at once this knight seemed to throw aside his apathy, when he discovered
the leader of his party so hard bestead; for, setting spurs to
his horse, which was quite fresh, he came to his assistance like a
thunderbolt, exclaiming, in a voice like a trumpet-call, “desdichado,
to the rescue!” it was high time; for, while the disinherited knight was
pressing upon the templar, front-de-boeuf had got nigh to him with his
uplifted sword; but ere the blow could descend, the sable knight dealt
a stroke on his head, which, glancing from the polished helmet, lighted
with violence scarcely abated on the “chamfron” of the steed, and
front-de-boeuf rolled on the ground, both horse and man equally stunned
by the fury of the blow. “le noir faineant” then turned his horse upon
athelstane of coningsburgh; and his own sword having been broken

e crest, that
athelstane also lay senseless on the field. having achieved this double
feat, for which he was the more highly applauded that it was totally
unexpected from him, the knight seemed to resume the sluggishness of
his character, returning calmly to the northern extremity of the lists,
leaving his leader to cope as he best could with brian de bois-guilbert.
this was no longer matter of so much difficulty as formerly. the
templars horse had bled much, and gave way under the shock of the
disinherited knight’s charge. brian de bois-guilbert rolled on the
field, encumbered with the stirrup, from which he was unable to draw his
foot. his antagonist sprung from horseback, waved his fatal sword over
the head of his adversary, and commanded him to yield himself; when
prince john, more moved by the templars dangerous situation than he had
been by that of his rival, saved him the mortification of confessing
himself vanquished, by casting down his warder, and putting an end to
the conflict.

ife; and those who escaped best carried the marks of the conflict to
the grave with them. hence it is always mentioned in the old records, as
the gentle and joyous passage of arms of ashby.

it being now the duty of prince john to name the knight who had done
best, he determined that the honour of the day remained with the knight
whom the popular voice had termed “le noir faineant.” it was pointed out
to the prince, in impeachment of this decree, that the victory had been
in fact won by the disinherited knight, who, in the course of the
day, had overcome six champions with his own hand, and who had finally
unhorsed and struck down the leader of the opposite party. but prince
john adhered to his own opinion, on the ground that the disinherited
knight and his party had lost the day, but for the powerful assistance
of the knight of the black armour, to whom, therefore, he persisted in
awarding the prize.

to the surprise of all present, however, the knight thus preferred was
nowhere to be found. he had

left the lists immediately when the conflict
ceased, and had been observed by some spectators to move down one of
the forest glades with the same slow pace and listless and indifferent
manner which had procured him the epithet of the black sluggard. after
he had been summoned twice by sound of trumpet, and proclamation of
the heralds, it became necessary to name another to receive the honours
which had been assigned to him. prince john had now no further excuse
for resisting the claim of the disinherited knight, whom, therefore, he
named the champion of the day.

through a field slippery with blood, and encumbered with broken armour
and the bodies of slain and wounded horses, the marshals of the lists
again conducted the victor to the foot of prince john’s throne.

“disinherited knight,” said prince john, “since by that title only
you will consent to be known to us, we a second time award to you the
honours of this tournament, and announce to you your right to claim and
receive from the hands

of the queen of love and beauty, the chaplet of
honour which your valour has justly deserved.” the knight bowed low and
gracefully, but returned no answer.

while the trumpets sounded, while the heralds strained their voices in
proclaiming honour to the brave and glory to the victor--while ladies
waved their silken kerchiefs and embroidered veils, and while all ranks
joined in a clamorous shout of exultation, the marshals conducted the
disinherited knight across the lists to the foot of that throne of
honour which was occupied by the lady rowena.

on the lower step of this throne the champion was made to kneel down.
indeed his whole action since the fight had ended, seemed rather to have
been upon the impulse of those around him than from his own free will;
and it was observed that he tottered as they guided him the second time
across the lists. rowena, descending from her station with a graceful
and dignified step, was about to place the chaple
