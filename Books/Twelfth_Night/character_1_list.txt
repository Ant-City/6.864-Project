Orsino - 
                	A
powerful nobleman in the country of Illyria. Orsino is lovesick
for the beautiful Lady Olivia, but becomes more and more fond of
his handsome new page boy, Cesario, who is actually a woman--Viola.
Orsino is a vehicle through which the play explores the absurdity of
love: a supreme egotist, Orsino mopes around complaining how heartsick
he is over Olivia, when it is clear that he is chiefly in love with
the idea of being in love and enjoys making a spectacle of himself.
His attraction to the ostensibly male Cesario injects sexual ambiguity
into his character.
