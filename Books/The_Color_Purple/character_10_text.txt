name is adam. they are sanctified religious and very good to me. they live in a nice house next to the church where
samuel preaches, and we spend a lot of time on church business. i say "we" because they always try to include me in
everything they do, so i don't feel so left out and alone.

in the beginning was that they could not have children. and then, they say, "god" sent them olivia and adam.

i wanted to say, "god" has sent you their sister and aunt, but i didn't. yes, their children, sent by "god" are your children,
celie. and they are being brought up in love, christian charity and awareness of god. and now "god" has sent me to
watch over them, to protect and cherish them. to lavish all the love i feel for you on them. it is a miracle, isn't it? and no

there is a fashion in harlem now for boys to wear something called knickers— sort of baggy pants, fitted tight just below
the knee, and for girls to wear garlands of flowers in their hair. they must be the most beautiful children alive, and adam

then there were the dinners we were invited to, the breakfasts, lunches, and suppers. i gained five pounds just from

and all the people have indoor toilets, celie. and gas or electric lights!

used to coming to the mission school, but the smaller ones are not. their mothers sometimes drag them here, screaming

the olinka do not believe girls should be educated. when i asked a mother why she thought this, she said: a girl is
nothing to herself, only to her husband can she become something.

what can she become? i asked.

why, she said, the mother of his children.

are not mean to her, it is just— what is it? because she is where they are doing "boys' things" they do not see her. but
never fear, celie, olivia has your stubbornness and clearsightedness, and she is smarter than all of them, including adam,
put together.

why can't tashi come to school? she asked me. when i told her the olinka don't believe in educating girls she said, quick
as a flash. they're like white people at home who don't want colored people to learn.

the insects, for instance. for some reason, all of her bites turn into deep, runny sores, and she has a lot of trouble
sleeping at night because the noises from the forest frighten her. it is taking a long time for her to become used to the

chief's wives. samuel thinks it may be the water they use, which comes from a separate spring that runs clear even in the
dry season. but the rest of us have no ill effects. it is as if olivia fears the food from these wives because they all look so
unhappy and work so hard. whenever they see her they talk about the day when she will become their littlest sister/wife.
it is just a joke, and they like her, but i wish they wouldn't say it. even though they are unhappy and work like donkeys
they still think it is an honor to be the chief's wife. fie walks around all day holding his belly up and talking and drinking
palm wine with the healer.

dear celie,


tashi's mother and father were just here. they are upset because she spends so much time with olivia. she is changing,
becoming quiet and too thoughtful, they say. she is becoming someone else; her face is beginning to show the spirit of
one of her aunts who was sold to the trader because she no longer fit into village life. this aunt refused to marry the man
chosen for her. refused to bow to the chief. did nothing but lay up, crack cola nuts between her teeth and giggle.

they want to know what olivia and tashi do in my hut when all the other little girls are busy helping their mothers.

ashi lazy at home? i asked.

the father looked at the mother. she said. no, on the contrary, tashi works harder than most girls her age. and is quicker
to finish her work. but it is only because she wishes to spend her afternoons with olivia. she learns everything i teach her
as if she already knows it, said the mother, but this knowledge does not really enter her soul.

the mother seemed puzzled and afraid.

the father, angry.

i thought: aha. tashi knows she is learning a way of life she will never live. but i did not say this.

the world is changing, i said. it is no longer a world just for boys and men.

our women are respected here, said the father. we would never let them tramp the world as american women do. there

toward the ground. the women also do not "look in a man's face" as they say. to "look in a man's face" is a brazen thing
to do. they look instead at his feet or his knees. and what can i say to this? again, it is our own behavior around pa.

next time tashi appears at your gate, you will send her straight home, her father said. then he smiled. your olivia can
visit her, and learn what women are for.

i smiled also. olivia must learn to take her education about life where she can find it, i thought. his offer will make a
splendid opportunity.

good-bye until the next time, dear celie, from a pitiful, castout woman who may perish during the rainy season.

made, although the roadbuilders are from a different tribe some distance to the north and nearer the coast, and their
language is somewhat different. i don't understand it, anyway, though the people of olinka seem to. but they are clever
people about most things, and understand new things very quickly.

it is hard to believe we've been here five years. time moves slowly, but passes quickly. adam and olivia are nearly as tall
as me and doing very well in all their studies. adam has a special aptitude for figures and it worries samuel that soon he
will have nothing more to teach him in this field, having exhausted his own knowledge.

when we were in england we met missionaries who sent their children back home when it was no longer possible to
teach them in the bush. but it is hard to imagine life here without the children. they love the open feeling of the village,
and love living in huts. they ar

e excited by the hunting expertise of the men and the self-sufficiency of the women in
raising their crops. no matter how down i may be, and sometimes i get very down indeed, a hug from olivia or adam
completely restores me to the level of functioning, if nothing else. their mother and i are not as close as we once were,
but i feel more like their aunt than ever. and the three of us look more and more alike every day.

about a month ago, corrine asked me not to invite samuel to my hut unless she were present. she said it gave the
villagers the wrong idea. this was a real blow to me because i treasure his company. since corrine almost never visits me
herself i will have hardly anybody

 to talk to, just in friendship. but the children still come and sometimes spend the night
when their parents want to be alone. i love those times. we roast groundnuts on my stove, sit on the floor and study
maps of all the countries in the world. sometimes tashi comes over and tells stories that are popular among the olinka
children. i am encouraging her and olivia to write them down in olinka and english. it will be good practice for them.
olivia feels that, compared to tashi, she has no good stories to tell. one day she started in on an "uncle remus" tale only
to discover tashi had the original version of it! her little face just fell. but then we got into a discussion of how tashi's
people's stories got to america, which fascinated tashi. she cried when olivia told how her grandmother had been
treated as a slave.

no one else in this village wants to hear about slavery, however. they acknowledge no responsibility whatsoever. this is

that was several months ago, and so far nothing has happened. the people live like ostriches, never setting foot on the
new road if they can help it, and never, ever, looking towards the coast. we have built another church and school. i have
another hut. and so we wait.

meanwhile, corrine has been very ill with african fever. many missionaries in the past have died from it.

but the children are fine. the boys now accept olivia and tashi in class and more mothers are sending their daughters to
school. the men do not like it: who wants a wife who knows everything her husband knows? they fume. but the women
have their ways, and they love their children, even their girls.

you could have spit them out, she said.

maybe just living together, loving people makes them look like you, i said. you know how much some old married people
look alike.

even these women saw the resemblance the first day we came, she said.

and that's worried you all this time? i tried to laugh it off
but she just looked at me.

when did you first meet my husband? she wanted to know.

and that was when i knew what she thought. she thinks adam and olivia are my children, and that samuel is their father!
oh, celie, this thing has been gnawing away at her all these years!

i met samuel the same day i met you, corrine, i said. (i still haven't got the hang of saying "sister" all the time.) as god is
my witness, that's the truth.

bring the bible, she said.

i brought the bible, and placed my hand on it, and swore.

you've never known me to lie, corrine, i said. please believe i am not lying now.

then she called samuel, and made him swear that the

stranger appeared in the community, and lavished all his attention on the widow
and her children; in a short while, they were married. almost at once she was pregnant a third time, though her mental
health was no better. every year thereafter, she was pregnant, every year she became weaker and more mentally
unstable, until, many years after she married the stranger, she died.

two years before she died she had a baby girl that she was too sick to keep. then a baby boy. these children were named
olivia and adam.

this is samuel's story, almost word for word.

the stranger who married the widow was someone samuel had run with long before he found christ. when the man
showed up at samuel's house with first olivia and then adam, samuel felt not only unable to refuse the children, but as if
god had answered his and corrine's prayers.

he never told corrine about the man or about the children's "mother" because he hadn't wanted any sadness to cloud
her happiness.

but then, out of nowhere, i appea

she turned her face to the wall.

corrine, i said, i'm the children's aunt. their mother is my older sister, celie.

then i told them the whole story. only corrine was still not convinced.

you and samuel telling so many lies, who can believe anything you say? she asked.

you've got to believe nettie, said samuel. though the part about you and pa was a real shock to him.

then i remembered what you told me about seeing corrine and samuel and olivia in town, when she was buying cloth to
make her and olivia dresses, and how you sent me to her because she was the only woman you'd ever seen with money. i
tried to make corrine remember that day, but she couldn't.

she gets weaker and weaker, and unless she can believe us and start to feel something for her children, i fear we will lose
her.

oh, celie, unbelief is a terrible thing. and so is the hurt we cause others unknowingly.

pray for us,

ek i've been trying to get corrine to remember meeting you in town. i know if she can just recall
your face, she will believe olivia (if not adam) is your child. they think olivia looks like me, but that is only because i look
like you. olivia has your face and eyes, exactly. it amazes me that corrine didn't see the resemblance.

remember the main street of town? i asked. remember the hitching post in front of finley's dry goods store? remember
how the store smelled like peanut shells?

she says she remembers all this, but no men speaking to her.

then i remember her quilts. the olinka men make beautiful quilts which are full of animals and birds and people. and as
soon as corrine saw them, she began to make a quilt that alternated o

block, using the clothes the children had outgrown, and some of her old dresses.

i went to her trunk and started hauling out quilts.

don't touch my things, said corrine. i'm not gone yet.

i held up first one and then another to the light, trying to find the first one i remembered her making. and trying to
remember, at the same time, the dresses she and olivia were wearing the first months i lived with them.

aha, i said, when i found what i was looking for, and laid the quilt across the bed.

do you remember buying this cloth? i asked, pointing to a flowered square. and what about this checkered bird?

she traced the patterns with her finger, and slowly her eyes filled with tears.

she was so much like olivia! she said. i was afraid she'd want her back. so i forgot her as soon as i could. all i let myself
think about was how the clerk treated me! i

what i thought about, even told samuel about, on the way home. not about your sister— what was her name?— celie?
nothing about her.

she began to cry in earnest. me and samuel holding her hands.

don't cry. don't cry, i said. my sister was glad to see olivia with you. glad to see her alive. she thought both her children
were dead.

poor thing! said samuel. and we sat there talking a little and holding on to each other until corrine fell off to sleep.

but, celie, in the middle of the night she woke up, turned to samuel and said: i believe. and died anyway.

keep going as if nothing is happening, or be an embarrassment to samuel, the children and myself. not to mention the
villagers, who think women who have their friends should not even be seen.

right after her mother's death, olivia got her friend; she and tashi tend to each other is my guess. nothing is said to me,
in any event, and i don't know how to bring the subject up. which feels wrong to me; but if you talk to an olinka girl
about her private parts, her mother and father will be annoyed, and it is very important to olivia not to be looked upon as
an outsider. although the one ritual they do have to celebrate womanhood is so bloody and painful, i forbid olivia to even
think about it.

do you remember how scared i wa

what girlhood i might have had passed me by. and i have nothing of my own. no man, no children, no close friend,
except for samuel. but i do have children, adam and olivia. and i do have friends, tashi and catherine. i even have a
family— this village, which has fallen on such hard times.

now the engineers have come to inspect the territory. two white men came yesterday and spent a couple of hours
strolling about the village, mainly looking at the wells. such is the innate politeness of the olinka that they rushed about
preparing food for them, though precious little is left, since many of the gardens that flourish at this time of the year have
been destroyed.

time— and great healthy african teeth.

as i write about his sunny smile i realize he's been unusually glum during this trip. interested and excited, but not really
sunny, except when he's with young harold.

i will have to ask olivia what's wrong. she is thrilled at the thought of going back to england. her mother used to tell her
about the thatched cottages of the english and how they reminded her of the roofleaf huts of the olinka. they are square,
though, she'd say. more like our church and school than like our homes, which olivia thought very strange.

when we reached england, samuel and i presented the olinka's grievances to the bishop of the english branch of our

then i told them about you, celie. and about their mother corrine's love of them. and about being their aunt.

but where is this other woman, your sister? asked olivia.

i explained your marriage to mr. as best i could.

adam was instantly alarmed. he is a very sensitive soul who hears what isn't said as clearly as what is.

we will go back to america soon, said samuel to reassure him, and see about her.

the children stood up with us in a simple church ceremony in london. and it was that night, after the wedding dinner,
when we were all getting ready for bed, that olivia told me what has been troubling her brother. he is missing tashi.

i didn't know this. one of the things we thought we'd helped stop was the scarring or cutting of tribal marks on the faces
of young women.

it is a way the olinka can show they still have their own ways, said olivia, even though the white man has taken
everything else. tashi didn't want to do it, but to make her people feel better, she's resigned. she's going to have the
female initiation ceremony too, she said.


oh, no, i said. that's so dangerous. suppose she becomes infected?

i know, said olivia. i told her nobody in america or europe cuts off pieces of themselves. and anyway, she would have had

tashi was happy that the initiation ceremony isn't done in europe or america, said olivia. that makes it even more

she and adam had an awful fight. not like any they've had before. he wasn't teasing her or chasing her around the village
or trying to tie roofleaf twigs in her hair. he was mad enough to strike her.

well, it's a good thing he didn't, i said. tashi would have jammed his head through her rug loom.

the children... i realize i shouldn't call them children, they're grown, went in search of tashi; an hour later they returned
dumbfounded. they discovered no sign of her. catherine, her mother, is planting rubber trees some distance from the
compound, they were told. but no one had seen tashi all day.

olivia was very disappointed. adam was trying to appear unconcerned, but i noticed he was absentmindedly biting the
skin around his nails.

after two days it became clear that tashi was deliberately hiding. her friends said while we were away she'd undergone
both the facial scarification ceremony and the rite of female initiation. adam went quite gray at this news. olivia merely

adam he refused to take it. he just looked at her scars, turned on his heel and left.

she and olivia hugged. but it was a quiet, heavy embrace. nothing like the boisterous, giggling behavior i expect from
them.

tashi is, unfortunately, ashamed of these scars on her face, and now hardly ever raises her head. they must be painful
too because they look irritated and red.

but this is what the villagers are doing to the young women and even the men. carving their identification as a people
into their children's faces. but the children think of scarification as backward, something from their grand

your sister, celie


dearest celie,


tashi and her mother have run away. they have gone to join the mbeles. samuel and the children and i were discussing it
just yesterday, and we realized we do not even know for sure the mbeles exist. all we know is that they are said to live
deep in the forest, that they welcome runaways, and that they harass the white man's plantations and plan his
destruction— or at least for his removal from their continent.

adam and olivia are heartbroken because they love tashi and miss her, and because no one who has gone to join the
mbeles ever returned. we try to keep them busy around the compound and because there is so much sickness from
malaria this season there is plenty for them to do. in plowing under the olinka's yam crop and substituting canned and
powdered goods, the planters destroyed what makes them resistant to malaria. of course they did not know this, they
only wanted to take the land for rubber, but the olinka

rs. left without a sufficient supply of yams, the people— what's left of
them— are sickening and dying at an alarming rate.

to tell you the truth, i fear for our own health, and especially for the children. but samuel feels we will probably be all
right, having had bouts with malaria during the first years we were here.

and how are you, dearest sister? nearly thirty years have passed without a word between us. for all i know you may be
dead. as the time nears for us to come home, adam and olivia ask endless questions about you, few of which i can
answer. sometimes i tell them tashi reminds me of you. and, because there is no one finer to them than tashi, they glow
with delight. but will you still have tashi's honest and open spirit, i wonder, when we see you again? or will years of

childbearing and abuse from mr. have destroyed it? these are thoughts i don't pursue with the children, only with

my beloved companion, samuel, who advises me not to worry, to trust in god, and to have fai

 the hostility towards them, having grown up
here? when i think of them in america i see them as much younger than they appear here. much more naive. the worst
we have had to endure here is indifference and a certain understandable shallowness in our personal
relationships— excluding our relationship with catherine and tashi. after all, the olinka know we can leave, they must
stay. and, of course, none of this has to do with color. and —

dearest celie,

last night i stopped writing because olivia came in to tell me adam is missing. he can only have gone after tashi.

pray for his safety.
your sister, nettie


dearest nettie,


sometimes i think shug never love me. i stand looking at my naked self in the looking glass. what would she love? i ast
myself. my hair is short and kinky because i don't straighten it anymore. once shug say she love it no need to. my skin
dark. my nose just a nose. my lips just lips. my body just any woman's body going through the changes of age. nothing
special

 minds seem to have been completely riveted on each other.

i wish you could have seen them as they staggered into the compound. filthy as hogs, hair as wild as could be. sleepy.
exhausted. smelly. god knows. but still arguing.

just because i came back with you, don't think i am saying yes to marriage, says tashi.

oh yes you are, says adam, heatedly, but through a yawn. you promised your mother. / promised your mother.

nobody in america will like me, says tashi.

i will like you, says adam.

olivia ran and enfolded tashi in her arms. ran about preparing food and a bath.

last night, after tashi and adam had slept most of the day, we had a family conference. we informed them that because
so many of our people had gone to join the mbeles and the planters were beginning to bring in moslem workers from the
north, and because it was time for us to do so, we would be leaving for home in a matter of weeks.

adam announced his desire to marry tashi.

tashi announced her refusal to be married.

 seen the magazines we receive from home and that it was very clear to her that
black people did not truly admire blackskinned black people like herself, and especially did not admire blackskinned black
women. they bleach their faces, she said. they fry their hair. they try to look naked.

also, she continued, i fear adam will be distracted by one of these naked looking women and desert me. then i would
have no country, no people, no mother and no husband and brother.

you'd have a sister, said olivia.

then adam spoke. he asked tashi to forgive his initial stupid response to the scarification. and to forgive the repugnance
he'd felt about the female initiation ceremony. he assured tashi that it was she he loved and that in america she would
have country, people, parents, sister, husband, brother and lover, and that whatever befell her in america would also be
his own choice and his own lot.

oh, celie.

so, the next day, our boy came to us with scars identical to tashi's on his cheeks.

and

 they are so happy. so happy, celie. tashi and adam omatangu.

samuel married them, of course, and all the people left in the compound came to wish them happiness and an
abundance of roofleaf forever. olivia stood up with the bride and a friend of adam's— a man too old to have joined the
mbeles — stood up with him. immediately after the wedding we left the compound, riding in a lorry that took us to a boat
at the coast inlet that flows out to sea.

in a few weeks, we will all be home.


your loving sister, nettie
