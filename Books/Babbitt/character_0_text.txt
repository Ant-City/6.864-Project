glittering shops where
five thousand men worked beneath one roof, pouring out the honest wares
that would be sold up the euphrates and across the veldt. the whistles
rolled out in greeting a chorus cheerful as the april dawn; the song of
labor in a city built--it seemed--for giants.

there was nothing of the giant in the aspect of the man who was
beginning to awaken on the sleeping-porch of a dutch colonial house in
that residential district of zenith known as floral heights.

his name was george f. babbitt. he was forty-six years old now, in
april, 1920, and he made nothing in particular, neither butter nor shoes
nor poetry, but he was nimble in the calling of selling houses for more
than people could afford to pay.

his large head was pink, his brown hair thin and dry. his face was
babyish in slumber, despite his wrinkles and the red spectacle-dents on
the slopes of his nose. he was not fat but he was exceedingly well fed;
his cheeks were pads, and the unroughened hand which lay helpless upon

he finished his shaving in a growing testiness increased by his spinning
headache and by the emptiness in his stomach. when he was done, his
round face smooth and streamy and his eyes stinging from soapy water,
he reached for a towel. the family towels were wet, wet and clammy and
vile, all of them wet, he found, as he blindly snatched them--his
own face-towel, his wife's, verona's, ted's, tinka's, and the lone
bath-towel with the huge welt of initial. then george f. babbitt did
a dismaying thing. he wiped his face on the guest-towel! it was a
pansy-embroidered trifle which always hung there to indicate that the
babbitts were in the best floral heights society. no one had ever used
it. no guest had ever dared to. guests secretively took a corner of the
nearest regular towel.

he was raging, "by golly, here they go and use up all the towels, every
doggone one of 'em, and they use 'em and get 'em all wet and sopping,
and never put out a dry one for me--of course, i'm

hill abominations into the bath-tub, pleased by
the vindictiveness of that desolate flapping sound; and in the midst his
wife serenely trotted in, observed serenely, "why georgie dear, what are
you doing? are you going to wash out the towels? why, you needn't wash
out the towels. oh, georgie, you didn't go and use the guest-towel, did
you?"

it is not recorded that he was able to answer.

for the first time in weeks he was sufficiently roused by his wife to
look at her.

myra babbitt--mrs. george f. babbitt--was definitely mature. she had
creases from the corners of her mouth to the bottom of her chin, and her
plump neck bagged. but the thing that marked her as having passed the
line was that she no longer had reticences before her husband, and no
longer worried about not having reticences. she was in a petticoat now,
and corsets which bulged, and unaware of being seen in bulgy corsets.
she had become so dully habituated to married life that in her full
matronliness she was as sexless as an anemic

he kissed her--he didn't quite kiss her--he laid unmoving lips against
her unflushing cheek. he hurried out to the garage, muttering: "lord,
what a family! and now myra is going to get pathetic on me because we
don't train with this millionaire outfit. oh, lord, sometimes i'd like
to quit the whole game. and the office worry and detail just as bad. and
i act cranky and--i don't mean to, but i get--so darn tired!"

to george f. babbitt, as to most prosperous citizens of zenith, his
motor car was poetry and tragedy, love and heroism. the office was his
pirate ship but the car his perilous excursion ashore.

among the tremendous crises of each day none was more dramatic than
starting the engine. it was slow on cold mornings; there was the long,
anxious whirr of the starter; and sometimes he had to drip ether into
the cocks of the cylinders, which was so very interesting that at lunch
he would chronicle it drop by drop, and oral

the future of the
german mark, the translation of "hinc illae lachrimae," or the number of
products of coal tar. he awed babbitt by confessing that he often sat up
till midnight reading the figures and footnotes in government reports,
or skimming (with amusement at the author's mistakes) the latest volumes
of chemistry, archeology, and ichthyology.

but littlefield's great value was as a spiritual example. despite
his strange learnings he was as strict a presbyterian and as firm a
republican as george f. babbitt. he confirmed the business men in the
faith. where they knew only by passionate instinct that their system of
industry and manners was perfect, dr. howard littlefield proved it
to them, out of history, economics, and the confessions of reformed
radicals.

babbitt had a good deal of honest pride in being the neighbor of such a
savant, and in ted's intimacy with eunice littlefield. at sixteen
eunice was interested in no statistics save those regarding the ages
and salaries of motion-picture stars

by a tragedy familiar to the world of art, the april enthusiasm of chet
laylock served only to stimulate the talent of the older craftsman,
george f. babbitt. he grumbled to stanley graff, "that tan-colored voice
of chet's gets on my nerves," yet he was aroused and in one swoop he
wrote:

do you respect your loved ones?

that you have done your best for the departed? you haven't unless they

enough, to establish him as one of the ruling caste of good fellows. yet
his eventual importance to mankind was perhaps lessened by his large and
complacent ignorance of all architecture save the types of houses turned
out by speculative builders; all landscape gardening save the use of
curving roads, grass, and six ordinary shrubs; and all the commonest
axioms of economics. he serenely believed that the one purpose of the
real-estate business was to make money for george f. babbitt. true,
it was a good advertisement at boosters' club lunches, and all the
varieties of annual banquets to which good fellows were invited, to
speak sonorously of unselfish public service, the broker's obligation
to keep inviolate the trust of his clients, and a thing called ethics,
whose nature was confusing but if you had it you were a high-class
realtor and if you hadn't you were a shyster, a piker, and a
fly-by-night. these virtues awakened confidence, and enabled you to
handle bigger propos

its vices to mike monday and his expert reclamation corps. the more
enterprising organizations of the city had voted to invite him--mr.
george f. babbitt had once praised him in a speech at the boosters'
club. but there was opposition from certain episcopalian and
congregationalist ministers, those renegades whom mr. monday so finely
called "a bunch of gospel-pushers with dish-water instead of blood, a
gang of squealers that need more dust on the knees of their pants and
more hair on their skinny old chests." this opposition had been
crushed when the secretary of the chamber of commerce had reported to a
committee of manufacturers that in every

at that moment in zenith, three hundred and forty or fifty thousand
ordinary people were asleep, a vast unpenetrated shadow. in the slum
beyond the railroad tracks, a young man who for six months had sought
work turned on the gas and killed himself and his wife.

at that moment lloyd mallam, the poet, owner of the hafiz book shop,
was finishing a rondeau to show how diverting was life amid the feuds of
medieval florence, but how dull it was in so obvious a place as zenith.

and at that moment george f. babbitt turned ponderously in bed--the
last turn, signifying that he'd had enough of this worried business of
falling asleep and was about it in earnest.

instantly he was in the magic dream. he was somewhere among unknown
people who laughed at him. he slipped away, ran down the paths of a
midnight garden, and at the gate the fairy child was waiting. her
dear and tranquil hand caressed his cheek. he was gallant and wise and
well-beloved; warm ivory were her arms; and beyond perilous moors the

the decayed and drowsy voice of the loafer, the agreeable stink of
beer-dregs, threw a spell of inanition over babbitt. the bartender moved
grimly toward the crowd of two men. babbitt followed him as delicately
as a cat, and wheedled, "say, oscar, i want to speak to mr. hanson."

"whajuh wanta see him for?"

"i just want to talk to him. here's my card."

it was a beautiful card, an engraved card, a card in the blackest black
and the sharpest red, announcing that mr. george f. babbitt was estates,
insurance, rents. the bartender held it as though it weighed ten pounds,
and read it as though it were a hundred words long. he did not bend from
his episcopal dignity, but he growled, "i'll see if he's around."

from the back room he brought an immensely old young man, a quiet
sharp-eyed man, in tan silk shirt, checked vest hanging open, and
burning brown trousers--mr. healey hanson. mr. hanson said only "yuh?"
but his implacable and contemptuous eyes queried babbitt's soul, and h

he was, it seemed, quite ready to answer their questions. he was "glad
to be with them, this evening."

frink spelled out the messages by running through the alphabet till the
spirit interpreter knocked at the right letter.

littlefield asked, in a learned tone, "do you like it in the paradiso,

studying this great truth of spiritualism," dante replied.

quickly; he said gently to zilla:

"i suppose you imply i have a lot of sweethearts."

"yes, i do!"

"well, then, my dear, since you ask for it--there hasn't been a time in
the last ten years when i haven't found some nice little girl to
comfort me, and as long as you continue your amiability i shall probably
continue to deceive you. it isn't hard. you're so stupid."

zilla gibbered; she howled; words could not be distinguished in her
slaver of abuse.

then the bland george f. babbitt was transformed. if paul was dangerous,
if zilla was a snake-locked fury, if the neat emotions suitable to the
revelstoke arms had been slashed into raw hatreds, it was babbitt who
was the most formidable. he leaped up. he seemed very large. he seized
zilla's shoulder. the cautions of the broker were wiped from his face,
and his voice was cruel:

ion, ohio, was appointed
president of the united states, but zenith was less interested in the
national campaign than in the local election. seneca doane, though he
was a lawyer and a graduate of the state university, was candidate for
mayor of zenith on an alarming labor ticket. to oppose him the democrats
and republicans united on lucas prout, a mattress-manufacturer with a
perfect record for sanity. mr. prout was supported by the banks, the
chamber of commerce, all the decent newspapers, and george f. babbitt.

babbitt was precinct-leader on floral heights, but his district was safe
and he longed for stouter battling. his convention paper had given him
the beginning of a reputation for oratory, so the republican-democratic
central committee sent him to the seventh ward and south zenith, to
address small audiences of workmen and clerks, and wives uneasy with
their new votes. he acquired a fame enduring for weeks. now and then a
reporter was present at one of his meetings, and the headlines (though
th

ey were not very large) indicated that george f. babbitt had addressed
cheering throng, and distinguished man of affairs had pointed out the
fallacies of doane. once, in the rotogravure section of the sunday
advocate-times, there was a photograph of babbitt and a dozen other
business men, with the caption "leaders of zenith finance and commerce
who back prout."

he deserved his glory. he was an excellent campaigner. he had faith; he
was certain that if lincoln were alive, he would be electioneering for

bid on it for him. the strain of the street traction deal and his
disappointment in stanley graff had so shaken babbitt that he found
it hard to sit at his desk and concentrate. he proposed to his family,
"look here, folks! do you know who's going to trot up to chicago for a
couple of days--just week-end; won't lose but one day of school--know
who's going with that celebrated business-ambassador, george f. babbitt?
why, mr. theodore roosevelt babbitt!"

"hurray!" ted shouted, and "oh, maybe the babbitt men won't paint that
lil ole town red!"

and, once away from the familiar implications of home, they were two men
together. ted was young only in his assumption of oldness, and the only
realms, apparently, in which babbitt had a larger and more grown-up
knowledge than ted's were the details of real estate and the phrases of
politics. when the other sages of the pullman smoking-compartment had

sir gerald's room was, except for his ponderous and durable english
bags, very much like the room of george f. babbitt; and quite in the
manner of babbitt he disclosed a huge whisky flask, looked proud and
hospitable, and chuckled, "say, when, old chap."

it was after the third drink that sir gerald proclaimed, "how do you
yankees get the notion that writing chaps like bertrand shaw and this

all the way out to biddlemeier's inn he tried to talk as an old friend,
but he could not pierce the wall of her words. with interminable
indignation she narrated her retorts to "that fresh head-barber" and the
drastic things she would do to him if he persisted in saying that she
was "better at gassing than at hoof-paring."

at biddlemeier's inn they were unable to get anything to drink. the
head-waiter refused to understand who george f. babbitt was. they
sat steaming before a vast mixed grill, and made conversation about
baseball. when he tried to hold ida's hand she said with bright
friendliness, "careful! that fresh waiter is rubbering." but they came
out into a treacherous summer night, the air lazy and a little moon
above transfigured maples.

"let's drive some other place, where we can get a drink and dance!" he
demanded.

"sure, some other night. but i promised ma i'd be home early to-night."

es in it but with a board, sitting awkwardly amidships and poking
at the water rather than paddling, he made his way far out on the lake.
the lights of the hotel and the cottages became yellow dots, a cluster
of glow-worms at the base of sachem mountain. larger and ever more
imperturbable was the mountain in the star-filtered darkness, and the
lake a limitless pavement of black marble. he was dwarfed and dumb and
a little awed, but that insignificance freed him from the pomposities of
being mr. george f. babbitt of zenith; saddened and freed his heart.
now he was conscious of the presence of paul, fancied him (rescued
from prison, from zilla and the brisk exactitudes of the tar-roofing
business) playing his violin at the end of the canoe. he vowed, "i will

cynical, holding behind apparent changes its essential purpose. though
babbitt had deserted his family and dwelt with joe paradise in the
wilderness, though he had become a liberal, though he had been quite
sure, on the night before he reached zenith, that neither he nor the
city would be the same again, ten days after his return he could not
believe that he had ever been away. nor was it at all evident to his
acquaintances that there was a new george f. babbitt, save that he was
more irritable under the incessant chaffing at the athletic club, and
once, when vergil gunch observed that seneca doane ought to be hanged,
babbitt snorted, "oh, rats, he's not so bad."

at home he grunted "eh?" across the newspaper to his commentatory wife,
and was delighted by tinka's new red tam o'shanter, and announced, "no

the good citizens' league had spread through the country, but nowhere
was it so effective and well esteemed as in cities of the type of
zenith, commercial cities of a few hundred thousand inhabitants, most
of which--though not all--lay inland, against a background of
cornfields and mines and of small towns which depended upon them for
mortgage-loans, table-manners, art, social philosophy and millinery.

to the league belonged most of the prosperous citizens of zenith. the
