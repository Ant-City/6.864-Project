she looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but
still loud enough for the furniture to hear:

ï¿½well, i lay if i get hold of you iï¿½ll--ï¿½

she did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching
under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the
punches with. she resurrected nothing but the cat.

ï¿½i never did see the beat of that boy!ï¿½

she went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the
tomato vines and ï¿½jimpsonï¿½ weeds that constituted the garden. no tom. so
she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:

ï¿½y-o-u-u tom!ï¿½

there was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize
a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.

ï¿½there! i might ï¿½aï¿½ thought of that closet. what you been doing in
there?ï¿½

ï¿½nothing.ï¿½

says, and i reckon itï¿½s so. heï¿½ll play hookey this evening, * and [*
southwestern for ï¿½afternoonï¿½] iï¿½ll just be obleeged to make him work,
tomorrow, to punish him. itï¿½s mighty hard to make him work saturdays,
when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he
hates anything else, and iï¿½ve _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or
iï¿½ll be the ruination of the child.ï¿½

tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. he got back home
barely in season to help jim, the small colored boy, saw next-dayï¿½s wood
and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time
to tell his adventures to jim while jim did three-fourths of the work.
tomï¿½s younger brother (or rather half-brother) sid was already through
with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,
and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.

while tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
offered, aunt polly asked him questions that were full of g

ith a bucket of whitewash and a
long-handled brush. he surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. thirty yards of board
fence nine feet high. life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a
burden. sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant
whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed
fence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. jim came skipping out at
the gate with a tin pail, and singing buffalo gals. bringing water from
the town pump had always been hateful work in tomï¿½s eyes, before, but
now it did not strike him so. he remembered that there was company at
the pump. white, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there
waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,
skylarking. and he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred
and fifty yards off, jim never got back with a buc

ket of water under an
hour--and even then somebody generally had to go after him. tom said:

ï¿½say, jim, iï¿½ll fetch the water if youï¿½ll whitewash some.ï¿½

jim shook his head and said:

ï¿½deed she would.ï¿½

ï¿½_she_! she never licks anybody--whacks ï¿½em over the head with her
thimble--and who cares for that, iï¿½d like to know. she talks awful, but
talk donï¿½t hurt--anyways it donï¿½t if she donï¿½t cry. jim, iï¿½ll give you a
marvel. iï¿½ll give you a white alley!ï¿½

jim began to waver.

ï¿½white alley, jim! and itï¿½s a bully taw.ï¿½

ï¿½my! datï¿½s a mighty gay marvel, i tell you! but mars tom iï¿½s powerful
ï¿½fraid ole missis--ï¿½

ï¿½and besides, if you will iï¿½ll show you my sore toe.ï¿½

jim was only human--this attraction was too much for him. he put down
his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound. in another moment he
was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, tom was
whitewashing with vigor, and au

was the back fence i wouldnï¿½t mind and _she_ wouldnï¿½t. yes, sheï¿½s awful

there ainï¿½t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it

heart. and while the late stea

iles away--so he had travelled,
and seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon the county
court-house--which was said to have a tin roof. the awe which these
reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
ranks of staring eyes. this was the great judge thatcher, brother of
their own lawyer. jeff thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar
with the great man and be envied by the school. it would have been music
to his soul to hear the whisperings:

ï¿½look at him, jim! heï¿½s a going up there. say--look! heï¿½s a going to
shake hands with him--he _is_ shaking hands with him! by jings, donï¿½t you
wish you was jeff?ï¿½

mr. walters fell to ï¿½showing off,ï¿½ with all sorts of official bustlings
and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging
directions here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. the
librarian ï¿½showed offï¿½--running hither and thither with his arms full of
books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insec

stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken
by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and
this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the
more profound. the boyï¿½s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings
were in happy accord with his surroundings. he sat long with his elbows
on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. it seemed to him
that life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied jimmy
hodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie
and slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through
the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and
nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. if he only had a
clean sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with
it all. now as to this girl. what had he done? nothing. he had meant
the best in the world, and been treated like a dog--like a very dog. she

ntown, a melancholy change had
come over everything and every creature. there had been a ï¿½revival,ï¿½ and
everybody had ï¿½got religion,ï¿½ not only the adults, but even the boys and
girls. tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed
sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. he found joe
harper studying a testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing
spectacle. he sought ben rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a
basket of tracts. he hunted up jim hollis, who called his attention to
the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. every boy
he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in
desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of huckleberry finn
and was received with a scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he
crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,
forever and forever.

and that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful

ent itself and died without accomplishing its
object. the boyï¿½s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. his
second was to wait--for there might not be any more storms.

the next day the doctors were back; tom had relapsed. the three weeks he
spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. when he got abroad
at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how
lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. he drifted
listlessly down the street and found jim hollis acting as judge in a
juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her
victim, a bird. he found joe harper and huck finn up an alley eating a
stolen melon. poor lads! they--like tom--had suffered a relapse.

at last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred--and vigorously: the murder
trial came on in the court. it became the absorbing topic of village
talk immediately. tom could not get away from it. every reference to
the murder sent a shudder to his hea
