[CHARACTER]

at first, [CHARACTER] might seem to be a rather cliched portrait of a
homosexual aesthete: he is physically weak, overly refined, obsessed with male
beauty, and somewhat promiscuous. but [CHARACTER] is also a great artist--the most
successful artist in the novel. unlike louis and bernard, who also harbor
literary ambitions, [CHARACTER] centers his life on his relationship to his art, to
the exclusion of most other relationships. this intense purity of focus seems to
make the difference in his success as a poet. from the start, [CHARACTER] is
disturbed by mess and disorder, continually noticing bernard's sloppiness of
dress. but [CHARACTER]'s desire for order goes beyond the material realm. for
[CHARACTER], life itself is a chaotic mess, and only in art and literature is
perfection attainable. [CHARACTER] understands this fact clearly after the death of
percival, whom [CHARACTER] loves and idealizes. once percival is gone, [CHARACTER] looks
to a series of lovers for a temporary replacement for the intense feelings he
once got from merely watching percival. in each case, [CHARACTER] uses his
concentrated if fleeting devotion to the new lover as a source of energy for
writing his poetry. in the end, [CHARACTER] sees that he has spent an entire
lifetime devoted to the study of love itself.
if bernard's problem with language is that it is not large enough to
contain reality, [CHARACTER]'s problem is that it is not focused enough to serve his
particular needs. [CHARACTER]'s life is one of concentration and exclusion. he shuts
the world out from his book-lined room, awaiting only the approach of his latest
"one." [CHARACTER]'s need for a focused, polished language to express his meaning is
part of the reason for his disdain for dr. crane and for conventional religion.
for [CHARACTER], the headmaster is a pompous fool, mouthing empty phrases, and most
religion is little more than a collection of such insincere words. beyond the
platitudes of the sermons he hears, [CHARACTER] also sees christianity as a
sad, death-obsessed religion and prefers the pagan greeks and
romans for what he sees as their love of life and pleasure in this
world.
