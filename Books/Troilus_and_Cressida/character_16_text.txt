    in troy, there lies the scene. from isles of greece
    the princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd,
    have to the port of athens sent their ships
    fraught with the ministers and instruments

  pandarus. an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen's-well,
    go to- there were no more comparison between the women. but, for
    my part, she is my kinswoman; i would not, as they term it,
    praise her, but i would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as
    i did. i  will not dispraise your sister cassandra's wit; but-
  troilus. o pandarus! i tell thee, pandarus-
    when i do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd,
    reply not in how many fathoms deep
    they lie indrench'd. i tell thee i am mad
    in cressid's love. thou answer'st 'she is fair'-
    pourest in the open ulcer of my heart-

    confess.
  cressida. without the rack.
  pandarus. and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
  cressida. alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
  pandarus. but there was such laughing! queen hecuba laugh'd that
    her eyes ran o'er.

  cressida. but there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
    eyes. did her eyes run o'er too?
  pandarus. and hector laugh'd.
  cressida. at what was all this laughing?
  pandarus. marry, at the white hair that helen spied on troilus'
    chin.
  cressida. an't had been a green hair i should have laugh'd too.

    beggar the estimation which you priz'd

  hector. now, youthful troilus, do not these high strains
    of divination in our sister work
    some touches of remorse, or is your blood
    so madly hot that no discourse of reason,
    nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
    can qualify the same?
  troilus. why, brother hector,
    we may not think the justness of each act
    such and no other than event doth form it;
    nor once deject the courage of our minds
    because cassandra's mad. her brain-sick raptures
    cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
    which hath our several honours all engag'd
    to make it gracious. for my private part,
    i am no more touch'd than all priam's sons;
    and jove forbid there should be done amongst us
    such things as might offend the weakest spleen
    to fight for and maintain.

    to stop his ears against admonishment?

  hector. you train me to offend you; get you in.
    by all the everlasting gods, i'll go.
  andromache. my dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.
  hector. no more, i say.

  cassandra. where is my brother hector?
  andromache. here, sister, arm'd, and bloody in intent.
    consort with me in loud and dear petition,
    pursue we him on knees; for i have dreamt
    of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
    hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.

    to hurt by being just. it is as lawful,
    for we would give much, to use violent thefts
    and rob in the behalf of charity.
  cassandra. it is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
    but vows to every purpose must not hold.

    mine honour keeps the weather of my fate.
    life every man holds dear; but the dear man
    holds honour far more precious dear than life.
