  greg. the heads of the maids?

  samp. ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
    take it in what sense thou wilt.

  greg. they must take it in sense that feel it.

  samp. me they shall feel while i am able to stand; and 'tis known i
    am a pretty piece of flesh.

 joyful news at hand.
    my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
    and all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
    lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
    i dreamt my lady came and found me dead
    (strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
    and breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
    that i reviv'd and was an emperor.
    ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    when but love's shadows are so rich in joy!

                enter romeo's man balthasar, booted.

    news from verona! how now, balthasar?
    dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
    how doth my lady? is my father well?
    how fares my juliet? that i ask again,
    for nothing can be ill if she be well.

  man. then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
    her body sleeps in capel's monument,
    and her immortal part with angels lives.
    i saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
    and presently took post to tell it you.
    o, pardon me for bringing

odging. get me ink and paper
    and hire posthorses. i will hence to-night.

  man. i do beseech you, sir, have patience.
    your looks are pale and wild and do import
    some misadventure.

  rom. tush, thou art deceiv'd.
    leave me and do the thing i bid thee do.
    hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

  man. no, my good lord.

  rom. no matter. get thee gone
    and hire those horses. i'll be with thee straight.
                                               exit [balthasar].
    well, juliet, i will lie with thee to-night.
    let's see for means. o mischief, thou art swift
    to enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
    i do remember an apothecary,
    and hereabouts 'a dwells, which late i noted
    in tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    culling of simples. meagre were his looks,
    sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
    and in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    an alligator stuff'd, and other skins
    of ill-shaped fishes; and ab

    why i descend into this bed of death
    is partly to behold my lady's face,

   pitiful sight! here lies the county slain;
    and juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
    who here hath lain this two days buried.
    go, tell the prince; run to the capulets;
    raise up the montagues; some others search.
                                   [exeunt others of the watch.]
    we see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
    but the true ground of all these piteous woes
    we cannot without circumstance descry.

  3. watch. here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
    we took this mattock and this spade from him
    as he was coming from this churchyard side.

  chief watch. a great suspicion! stay the friar too.

              enter the prince [and attendants].
