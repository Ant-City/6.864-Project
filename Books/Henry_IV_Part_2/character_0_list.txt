King Henry IV  - 
      The ruling king of England at the beginning of the play. His health declines throughout the play, in part due to his anxiety about civil insurrection and the fate of his seemingly irresponsible son, Hal. He dies before the end of the play, never having fulfilled his dream of leading a company of soldiers to fight in the Crusades in Jerusalem.
