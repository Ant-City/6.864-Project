the waitressâ€™s legs while she was bringing the food; it
was during the war and she had on shiny orange rayon stockings, heâ€™d never seen
them before, my mother didnâ€™t wear them. a different year there we ran through the
snow across the sidewalk in our bare feet because we had no shoes, theyâ€™d worn out
during the summer. in the car that time we sat with our feet wrapped in blankets,
pretending we were wounded. my brother said the germans shot our feet off.
now though iâ€™m in another car, davidâ€™s and annaâ€™s; itâ€™s sharp-finned and striped
with chrome, a lumbering monster left over from ten years ago, he has to reach
under the instrument panel to turn on the lights. david says they canâ€™t afford a newer
one, which probably isnâ€™t true. heâ€™s a good driver, i realize that, i keep my outside
hand on the door in spite of it. to brace myself and so i can get out quickly if i have
to. iâ€™ve driven in the same car with them before but on this road it doesnâ€™t seem

ed, but the thick power lines running into
the forest give it away. i heard theyâ€™d left, maybe that was a ruse, they could easily
still be living in there, the generals in concrete bunkers and the ordinary soldiers in
underground apartment buildings where the lights burn all the time. thereâ€™s no way
of checking because we arenâ€™t allowed in. the city invited them to stay, they were
good for business, they drank a lot.
â€œthatâ€™s where the rockets are,â€ i say. were. i donâ€™t correct it.
david says â€œbloody fascist pig yanks,â€ as though heâ€™s commenting on the
weather.
anna says nothing. her head rests on the back of the seat, the ends of her light
hair whipping in the draft from the side window that wonâ€™t close properly. earlier
she was singing, house of the rising sun and lili marlene, both of them several
times, trying to make her voice go throaty and deep; but it came out like a hoarse
childâ€™s. david turned on the radio, he couldnâ€™t get anything, we were between

s. when she was in the middle of st. louis blues he began to whistle and she
stopped. sheâ€™s my best friend, my best woman friend; iâ€™ve known her two months.
i lean forward and say to david, â€œthe bottle house is around this next curve and
to the left,â€ and he nods and slows the car. i told them about it earlier, i guessed it
was the kind of object that would interest them. theyâ€™re making a movie, joe is
doing the camera work, heâ€™s never done it before but david says theyâ€™re the new
renaissance men, you teach yourself what you need to learn. it was mostly davidâ€™s
idea, he calls himself the director: they already have the credits worked out. he
wants to get shots of things they come across, random samples he calls them, and
that will be the name of the movie too: random samples. when theyâ€™ve used up their
supply of film (which was all they could afford; and the camera is rented) theyâ€™re
going to look at what theyâ€™ve collected and rearrange it.
 
 ___________________________
 

â€œhow can you tell what to put in if you donâ€™t already know what itâ€™s about?â€ i
asked david when he was describing it. he gave me one of his initiate-to-novice
stares. â€œif you close your mind in advance like that you wreck it. what you need is
flow.â€ anna, over by the stove measuring out the coffee, said everyone she knew
was making a movie, and david said that was no fucking reason why he shouldnâ€™t.
she said â€œyouâ€™re right, sorryâ€; but she laughs about it behind his back, she calls it
random pimples.
the bottle house is built of pop bottles cemented together with the bottoms facing
out, green ones and brown ones in zig-zag patterns like the ones they taught us in
school to draw on teepees; thereâ€™s a wall around it made of bottles too, arranged in
letters so the brown ones spell bottle villa.
â€œneat,â€ david says, and they get out

about it except that itâ€™s been there forever, the tangled black spruce swamp around it
making it even more unlikely, a preposterous monument to some quirkish person
exiled or perhaps a voluntary recluse like my father, choosing this swamp because it
was the only place where he could fulfil his lifelong dream of living in a house of
bottles. inside the wall is an attempted lawn and a border with orange mattress-tuft
marigolds.
â€œgreat,â€ says david, â€œreally neat,â€ and he puts his arm around anna and hugs her
briefly to show heâ€™s pleased, as though she is somehow responsible for the bottle
villa herself. we get back in the car.
i watch the side windows as though itâ€™s a t.v. screen. thereâ€™s nothing i can
remember till we reach the border, marked by the sign that says bienvenu e on one side
and welcome on the other. the sign has bullet holes in it, rusting red around the edges. it
always did, in the fall the hunters use it for targ

et practice; no matter how many
times they replace it or paint it the bullet holes reappear, as though they arenâ€™t put
there but grow by a kind of inner logic or infection, like mould or boils. joe wants
to film the sign but david says â€œnaaa, what for?â€
now weâ€™re on my home ground, foreign territory. my throat constricts, as it
learned to do when i discovered people could say words that would go into my ears
meaning nothing. to be deaf and dumb would be easier. the cards they poke at you
when they want a quarter, with the hand alphabet on them. even so, you would need
to learn spelling.

free ones nudging each other inside it; they travel to the saws in a clanking overhead
chute, that hasnâ€™t been changed. the car goes under it and weâ€™re curving up into the
tiny company town, neatly planned with public flowerbeds and an eighteenth century
fountain in the middle, stone dolphins and a cherub with part of the face missing. it
looks like an imitation but it may be real.
anna says â€œoh wow, what a great fountain.â€
â€œthe company built the whole thing,â€ i say, and david says â€œrotten capitalist
bastardsâ€ and begins to whistle again.
i tell him to turn right and he does. the road ought to be here, but instead thereâ€™s a
battered chequerboard, the way is blocked.
â€œnow what,â€ says david.
we didnâ€™t bring a map because i knew we wouldnâ€™t need one. â€œiâ€™ll have to ask,â€ i
say, so he backs the car out and we drive along the main street till we come to a
corner store, magazines and candy.
â€œyou must mean the old road,â€ the woman says with only a tra

the cardboard barrel with a metal scoop. before, the ice cream came rolled in pieces
of paper which they would peel off like bark, pressing the short logs of ice cream
into the cones with their thumbs. those must be obsolete.
i go back to the car and tell david the directions. joe says he likes chocolate
better.
nothing is the same, i donâ€™t know the way any more. i slide my tongue around the
ice cream, trying to concentrate on it, they put seaweed in it now, but iâ€™m starting to
shake, why is the road different, he shouldnâ€™t have allowed them to do it, i want to
turn around and go back to the city and never find out what happened to him. iâ€™ll

neither would i. i bite do

the knife-hard pain up the side of my face. anaesthesia, thatâ€™s one technique: if it
hurts invent a different pain. iâ€™m all right.
david finishes his cone, tossing the carton-flavoured tip out the window, and
starts the car. we go through a part thatâ€™s spread out from the town since i was here,
freshly built square bungalows like city ones except for the pink and baby blue trim,
and a few oblong shacks further along, tar-paper and bare boards. a clutch of
children playing in the wet mud that substitutes for lawns; most of them are dressed
in clothes too big for them, which makes them seem stunted.

david says â€œthe true north strong and free.â€
beyond the houses, two older children, darkfaced, hold out tin cans toward the
car. raspberries perhaps.
we come to the gas station where the woman said to turn left and david groans
with joy, â€œoh god look at that,â€ and they pile out as though it will escape if they
arenâ€™t quick enough. what theyâ€™re after is the three stuffed moose on a platform
near the pumps: theyâ€™re dressed in human clothes and wired standing up on their
hind legs, a father moose with a trench-coat and a pipe in his mouth, a mother
moose in a print dress and flowered hat and a little boy moose in short pants, a
striped jersey and a baseball cap, waving an american flag.

shouldnâ€™t use the moose without paying, like the washrooms theyâ€™re here to attract
customers.

roof,â€ and there is, a little girl moose in a frilly skirt and a pigtailed blonde wig,
holding a red parasol in one hoof. they get her too. the owner of the gas station is

i have to keep myself from telling that story. still though, seeing the old road
billowing along at a distance through the trees (ruts and traces already blurring with
grass and saplings, soon it will be gone) makes me reach into my bag for the
lifesavers i brought. but they arenâ€™t needed any more, even though the new road
turns from pavement into gravel (â€œmustâ€™ve elected the wrong guy last time around,â€
david says jokingly) and the familiar smell of road dust fuming behind and around
us mixes with the gas-and-upholstery smell of the car.
â€œthought you said this would be bad,â€ david says over his shoulder, â€œitâ€™s not bad
at all.â€ weâ€™re nearly to the village already, the two roads joining here but widened â€“
rock blasted, trees bulldozed over, roots in the air, needles reddening â€“ past the flat
cliff where the election slogans are painted and painted over, some faded and
defaced, others f

we slur down the last hill, gravel pinging off the underside of the car, and suddenly
thereâ€™s a thing that isnâ€™t supposed to be here. motel, bar biÃ¨re beer the sign reads, neon even,
someone is trying; but to no avail, there arenâ€™t any cars parked outside and the vacancy
notice is up. the building is like any other cheap motel, long grey stucco with
aluminum doors; the earth around it is still chunky and raw, not yet overgrown with
the road weeds.
â€œletâ€™s pick up a few,â€ david says, to joe; heâ€™s already swerved the car.
we head towards the door but then i stop, itâ€™s the best place to leave them, and say
â€œyou go in and have a beer or something, iâ€™ll be back in about half an hour.â€
â€œright,â€ david says. he knows what to avoid.
â€œwant me to come?â€ joe offers, but when i say no relief gleams through his
beard. the three of them disappear through the screen door of the bar and i walk the
rest of the way down the hill.

only way i could make it, thereâ€™s no bus and no train and i never hitch. theyâ€™re
doing me a favour, which they disguised by saying it would be fun, they like to
travel. but my reason for being here embarrasses them, they donâ€™t understand it.
they all disowned their parents long ago, the way you are supposed to: joe never
mentions his mother and father, anna says hers were nothing people and david calls
his the pigs.

i find the others in the small chilly room labelled bar; theyâ€™re the only customers.
they have six beer bottles and four glasses on their orange formica-topped table. a
mottled boy with a haircut like the ones of the men in the store, only blonde, is
sitting with them.
david waves at me as i come in: heâ€™s happy about something. â€œhave a beer,â€ he
says. â€œthis is claude, his father owns this joint.â€
claude shambles off morosely to get me a beer. underneath the bar itself is a
crudely carved wooden fish with red and blue dots on it, intended possibly for a
speckled trout; on its leaping back it supports the fake marble surface. above the bar
is a t.v., turned off or broken, and the regulation picture, scrolled gilt frame, blownup
photograph of a stream with t

victoria had a set like that. but if this is what succeeds why shouldnâ€™t they do it?

of himself, the way he says he talked back in the fifties when he wanted to be a

night, the same place joe works; itâ€™s an adult education programme. david calls it
adult vegetation; he got the job because he was once a radio announcer.

from showing any reaction, no matter what has happened.
â€œno,â€ i say, â€œnothing different.â€ voice level, calm. perhaps that was what he liked
about me, there must have been something, though i canâ€™t reconstruct our first
meeting, now i can: it was in a store, i was buying some new brushes and a spray tin

very smoothly as if i were feeling no emotion. but i really wasnâ€™t.
claude comes back with the beer and i say â€œthank youâ€ and glance up at him and
his face dissolves and re-forms, he was about eight the last time i was here; he used
to peddle worms in rusted tin cans to the fishermen down by the government dock.
heâ€™s uneasy now, he can tell i recognize him.
â€œiâ€™d like to go down the lake for a couple of days,â€ i say, to david because itâ€™s his
car. â€œiâ€™d like to look around, if thatâ€™s okay.â€
â€œgreat,â€ says david, â€œiâ€™m gonna get me one of them smart fish.â€ he brought
along a borrowed fishing rod, though i warned him he might not have a chance to
use it: if my father had turned up after all we would have gone away without letting
him find out we were here. if heâ€™s safe i donâ€™t want to see him. thereâ€™s no point,
they never forgave me, they didnâ€™t understand the divorce; i donâ€™t think they eve

off and
leaving my husband and child, my attractive full-colour magazine illustrations,
suitable for framing. leaving my child, that was the unpardonable sin; it was no use
trying to explain to them why it wasnâ€™t really mine. but i admit i was stupid,
stupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results, and i didnâ€™t have any
excuses, i was never good at them. my brother was, he used to make them up in
advance of the transgressions; thatâ€™s the logical way.
â€œoh god,â€ anna says, â€œdavid thinks heâ€™s a great white hunter.â€ sheâ€™s teasing him,
she does that a lot; but he doesnâ€™t hear, heâ€™s getting up, claude is hustling him off to
make him out a licence, it seems claude is in charge of the licences. when david
comes back i want to ask how much he paid, but heâ€™s too pleased, i donâ€™t want to
spoil it. claude is pleased also.
we find out from claude we can hire evans, who owns the blue moon cabins, to
run us down the lake. paul would take us for nothing, he offered, but

right about it; also iâ€™m sure he would misinterpret joeâ€™s amorphous beard and
davidâ€™s moustache and three musketeers hair. theyâ€™re just a style now, like crew
cuts, but paul might feel they are dangerous, they mean riots.
david eases the car down the turnoff, two ruts and a rock hump in the centre that
scrapes the carâ€™s belly. we brake in front of the cabin marked office; evans is there, a
bulky laconic american in checked shirt and peaked cap and a thick knitted jacket
with an eagle on the back. he knows where my fatherâ€™s place is, all the older guides
know every house on the lake. he moves his cigarette butt to the corner of his
mouth and says heâ€™ll take us there, ten miles, for five dollars; for another five

pick us up two days from now, in the morning. that will give us the rest of the day
to drive back to the city. heâ€™s heard of the disappearance, of course, but he doesnâ€™t
mention it.
â€œa groovy old guy, eh?â€ david says when weâ€™re outside. heâ€™s enjoying himself,
he thinks this is reality: a marginal economy and grizzled elderly men, itâ€™s straight
out of depression photo essays. he spent four years in new york and became
political, he was studying something; it was during the sixties, iâ€™m not sure when.
my friendsâ€™ pasts are vague to me and to each other also, any one of us could have
amnesia for years and the others wouldnâ€™t notice.
when david has backed the car down to the blue moon dock we u

the packsacks of clothes, the camera equipment, the samsonite case with my career
in it, the half dozen red caps they got at the motel and the paper bag of food. we
scramble into the boat, a battered wood-hulled launch; evans starts the motor and
we churn out slowly. summer cottages beginning to sprout here, they spread like
measles, it must be the paved road.
david sits in front beside evans. â€œgettinâ€™ many fish?â€ he asks, folksy, chummy,
crafty. â€œhere and there, here and there,â€ evans says, giving no free handouts; then
he switches the motor into high gear and i canâ€™t hear any more.
i wait until weâ€™re into the middle of the lake. at the right moment i look over my
shoulder as i always did and there is the village, suddenly distanced and clear, the
houses receding and grouping, the white church startling against the dark of the
trees. the fee

and looked down. my brother was under the water, face upturned, eyes open and
unconscious, sinking gently; air was coming out of his mouth.
it was before i was born but i can remember it as clearly as if i saw it, and perhaps
i did see it: i believe that an unborn baby has its eyes open and can look out through
the walls of the motherâ€™s stomach, like a frog in a jar.

we unload our baggage while evans idles the motor. when david has paid him he
gives us an uninterested nod and backs the boat out, then turns it and swings around
the point, the sound dwindling to a whine and fading as land and distance move
between us. the lake jiggles against the shore, the waves subside, nothing remains
but a faint iridescent film of gasoline, purple and pink and green. the space is quiet,
the wind has gone down and the lake is flat, silver-white, itâ€™s the first time all day

i hope the door will be open but itâ€™s padlocked, as paul said he left it. i dig the
keys he gave me out of my bag and approach warily: whatever i find inside will be a
clue. what if he returned after paul locked it and couldnâ€™t get in? but there are other
ways of getting in, he could have broken a window.
joe and david are here now with the other packsacks and the beer. anna is behind
them with my case and the paper bag; sheâ€™s singing again, mockingbird hill.
i open the wooden door and the screen door inside it and scan the room
cautiously, then step inside. table covered with blue oilcloth, bench, another bench
which is a wooden box built against the wall, sofa with metal frame and thin
mattress, it folds out into a bed. that was where our mother used to be: all day she

they follow me inside. â€œis this where you lived?â€ joe asks. itâ€™s unusual for him to
ask me anything about myself: i canâ€™t tell whether heâ€™s pleased or discouraged. he
goes over to the snowshoes on the wall and lifts one down, taking refuge in his
hands.
anna puts the groceries on the counter and wraps her arms around herself. â€œit
must have been weird,â€ she says. â€œcut off from everything like that.â€
â€œno,â€ i say. to me it felt normal.
â€œdepends what youâ€™re used to,â€ david says. â€œi think itâ€™s neat.â€ but heâ€™s not certain.
there are two other rooms and i open the doors quickly. a bed in each, shelves,
clothes hanging on nails: jackets, raincoats, they were always left here. a grey hat,
he had several of those. in the right-hand room is a map of the district, tacked to the
wall. in the other are some pictures, watercolours, i recall now having painted them
when i was twelve or thirteen; the fact that iâ€™d forgotten about them is the only thing
that makes me

what i like, service.â€ she takes out cans for herself and us and we sit on the benches
and drink it. now that weâ€™re no longer moving the cabin is chilly.

happened, before he left. there might be something for me, a note, a message, a
will. i kept expecting that after my mother died, word of some kind, not money but
an object, a token. for a while i went twice a day to the post office box which was
the only one of my addresses iâ€™d given them; but nothing arrived, maybe she didnâ€™t
have time.
no dirty dishes, no clothing strewn around, no evidence. it doesnâ€™t feel like a
house thatâ€™s been lived in all winter.
â€œwhat time is it?â€ i ask david. he holds up his watch: itâ€™s almost five. it will be up
to me to organize dinner, since in a way this is my place, they are my guests.
thereâ€™s kindling in the box behind the stove and a few pieces of white birch; the
disease hasnâ€™t yet hit this part of the country. i find the matches and kneel in front of
the stove, iâ€™ve almost forgotten how to do this but after three or four matches i get it

pauper. there was something wrong with thompson also; â€œescapistâ€ was the term
he used. after that i liked them better, they werenâ€™t paragons any more.

the dial on his transistor radio; he canâ€™t pick up anything but static and a wail that
might be music, wavering in and out, and a tiny insect voice whispering in french.

sunset, smoking a little. the clouds to the west are yellow and grey, fading, and in
the clear sky southeast of us the moon is rising.

phrase, used to me once when i was fourteen; she was watching, dismayed, as i
covered my mouth with tango tangerine. i told her i was just practising.
anna says in a low voice, â€œhe doesnâ€™t like to see me without it,â€ and then,
contradicting herself, â€œhe doesnâ€™t know i wear it.â€ i glimpse the subterfuge this
must involve, or is it devotion: does she have to sneak out of the bed before heâ€™s
awake every morning and into it at night with the lights out? maybe david is telling
generous lies; but she blends and mutes herself so well he may not notice.
while the stove is heating i go outside, first up to the outhouse and down again to
the lake to dip my hands and face, then to the refrigerator, a metal garbage can sunk
in the ground with a tight-fitting raccoon-proof lid and over that a heavy wooden
cover. when the game wardens arrived in their police launch, as they did once a
year, they could never believe we didnâ€™t have an icebox, they used to search

i reach down for the eggs; the bacon is in a screened box under the cabin,
ventilated but protected from flies and mice. in a settlerâ€™s house these would have
been rootcellar and smoke-house; my father is an improvisor on standard themes.
i carry the food inside and start the breakfast. joe and david are up, joe sitting on
the wall bench, face still fuzzy with sleep, david examining his chin in the mirror.
â€œi can make you hot water if you want to shave,â€ i suggest, but his reflection grins
and he shakes his head.
â€œnaaa,â€ he says, â€œiâ€™m gonna grow me a little old beard.â€
â€œdonâ€™t you dare,â€ anna says. â€œi donâ€™t like him kissing me when he has a beard, it
reminds me of a cunt.â€ her hand goes over her mouth as though she is shocked.
â€œisnâ€™t that awful?â€

telling me there was a dead man in the sky watching everything i did and i retaliated
by explaining where babies came from. some of their mothers phoned mine to
complain, though i think i was more upset than they were: they didnâ€™t believe me but
i believed them.
i finish the toast; the bacon is done too, i dish it out, pouring the fat afterwards
into the fire, keeping my hand back from the spurt of flame.
after breakfast david says â€œwhatâ€™s on the agenda?â€ i tell them i would like to
search the trail that runs for half a mile close to the shore; my father may have gone
along it to get wood. there was another trail that went back almost as far as the
swamp but it was my brotherâ€™s and secret, by now it must be illegible.
he canâ€™t have left the island, both canoes are in the toolshed and the aluminum
motorboat is padlocked to a tree near the dock; the gas tanks for the motor are
empty.

but thatâ€™s avoiding, itâ€™s not unusual for a man to disappear in the bush, it happens
dozens of times each year. all it takes is a small mistake, going too far from the
house in winter, blizzards are sudden, or twisting your leg so you canâ€™t walk out, in
spring the blackflies would finish you, they crawl inside your clothes, youâ€™d be
covered with blood and delirious in a day. i canâ€™t accept it though, he knew too
much, he was too careful.
i give david the machete, i donâ€™t know what shape the trail will be in, we may
have to brush it out; joe carries the hatchet. before we start i coat their wrists and
ankles with bug spray, and my own also. i used to be immune to mosquitoes, iâ€™d
been bitten so much, but iâ€™ve lost it: on my legs and body are several itchy pink
bumps from last night. the sound of love in the north, a kiss, a slap.

the trail dips down and across a swamp inlet at the tip of a bay, cedars here and
bullrushes, blueflags, ooze. i go slowly, looking for footprints. thereâ€™s nothing but
a deer track, no sign of anyone: apparently paul and the searchers didnâ€™t make it this
far. the mosquitoes have scented us and swarm around our heads; joe swears
gently, david loudly, at the end of the line i hear anna slapping.
we swing away from the shore and here itâ€™s a jungle, branches growing in across
the path, hazel and moose maple, pithy junk trees. sight is blocked two feet in,
trunks and leaves a solid interlocking fence, green, green-grey, greybrown. none of
the branches is chopped or broken back, if heâ€™s been here heâ€™s gone miraculously
around and between them rather than through. i stand aside and david hacks at the
wall with his machete, not very

we come up against a tree fallen across the trail. itâ€™s brought several young
balsams down with it: they lie tangled together, logjam. â€œi donâ€™t think anyoneâ€™s been
through here,â€ i say, and joe says â€œright on,â€ heâ€™s annoyed: itâ€™s obvious. i peer into
the forest to see if another trail has been cut around the windfall but thereâ€™s no sign;
or there are too many signs, since iâ€™m anxious every opening between two trees
looks like a path.
david prods at the dead trunk with the machete, poking holes in the bark. joe sits
down on the ground: heâ€™s breathing hard, too much city, and the flies are getting to
him, he scratches his neck and the backs of his hands. â€œi guess thatâ€™s it,â€ i say
because i have to be the one to confess defeat, and anna says â€œthank god, theyâ€™re
eating me alive.â€
we start back. he could still be in there somewhere but i see now the impossibility
of searching the island for him, itâ€™s two miles long. i

ring lost on a beach or in the snow: futile. thereâ€™s no act i can perform except
waiting; tomorrow evans will ship us to the village, and after that weâ€™ll travel to the
city and the present tense. iâ€™ve finished what i came for and i donâ€™t want to stay here,
i want to go back to where there is electricity and distraction. iâ€™m used to it now,
filling the time without it is an effort.
the others are trying to amuse themselves. joe and david are out in one of the
canoes; i should have made them take life-jackets, neither of them can steer, theyâ€™re
shifting their paddles from side to side. i can see them from the front window and
from the side window i can see anna, partly hidden by trees. sheâ€™s lying on her
belly in bikini and sunglasses, reading a murder mystery, though she must be cold:
the sky has cleared a little, but when the clouds move in front of the sun the heat
shuts off.

sulking on the dock, resentful at being away from the city and the boyfriend iâ€™d
proved my normality by obtaining; i wore his ring, too big for any of my fingers,

when distance has disguised their faces and their awkwardness, might be my brother
and my father. the only place left for me is that of my mother; a problem, what she
did in the afternoons between the routines of lunch and supper. sometimes she
would take breadcrumbs or seeds out to the bird feeder tray and wait for the jays,
standing quiet as a tree, or she would pull weeds in the garden; but on some days she
would simply vanish, walk off by herself into the forest. impossible to be like my

perhaps itâ€™s not only his body i like, perhaps itâ€™s his failure; that also has a kind of
purity.
i crumple up my third princess, dump the paint water into the slop pail and clean
the brushes. i survey from the windows: david and joe are still out on the lake but
they seem to be heading back now. anna is halfway up the hillside stairs, towel over
her arm. i see her for a moment faceted by the screen door and then sheâ€™s inside.
â€œhi,â€ she says, â€œget anything done?â€
â€œnot much,â€ i say.
she comes over to the table and smooths out my botched princesses. â€œthatâ€™s

it takes me a moment to understand what she means. my father, his work. â€œi donâ€™t

she gives me an odd glance, as though iâ€™ve violated a propriety, and iâ€™m puzzled,
she told me once you shouldnâ€™t define yourself by your job but by who you are.
when they ask her what she does she talks about fluidity and being rather than
doing; though if she doesnâ€™t like the person she just says â€œiâ€™m davidâ€™s wife.â€
â€œhe was living,â€ i say. this is almost right, it satisfies her, she goes into the
bedroom to change her clothes.
all at once iâ€™m furious with him for vanishing like this, unresolved, leaving me
with no answers to give them when they ask. if he was going to die he should have
done it visibly, out in the open, so they could mark him with a stone and get it over
with.
they must find it strange, a man his age staying alone the whole winter in a cabin

anna walks out of the bedroom, dressed in jeans and shirt again. she combs her
hair in front of the mirror, light ends, dark roots, humming to herself, you are my
sunshine; smoke twines up from her cigarette. help, i think at her silently, talk. and
she does.

at supper we finish off the beer. david wants to go fishing, itâ€™s the last night, so i
leave the dishes for anna and go down to the garden with the shovel and the tin can
saved from the peas.
i dig in the weediest part near the compost heap, lifting the earth and letting it
crumble, sieving the worms out with my fingers. the soil is rich, the worms
scramble, red ones and pink ones.

i put the worms in the can and some dirt for them. as i walk back to the cabin i
hold my palm over the top; already theyâ€™re nudging with their head ends, trying to
get out. i make them a cover from a piece of paper torn off the grocery bag,
keeping it on with a rubber band. my mother was a saver: rubber bands, string,
safety pins, jam jars, for her the depression never ended.
david is fitting the sections of his borrowed fishing rod together; itâ€™s fibreglass, i
have no faith in it. i take the steel trolling rod from its hooks on the wall. â€œcome
on,â€ i tell david, â€œyou can use that one for still-fishing.â€
â€œshow me how to light the lamp,â€ anna says, â€œiâ€™ll stay here and read.â€

i tell her i need her in the canoe for extra weight, which is a lie as weâ€™ll be too
heavy already, but she takes my expert word.
while theyâ€™re getting into the canoe i return to the garden and catch a small
leopard frog as an emergency weapon. i put it in a jam jar and punch a few airholes
in the lid.

but i canâ€™t use any bug spray because it would get on the bait and the fish would
smell it.
i steer us along the mainland shore. a blue heron lifts from a bay where itâ€™s been
fishing and flaps overhead, neck and beak craning forward and long legs stretched
back, winged snake. it notes us with a rasping pterodactyl croak and rises higher,
heading southeast, there was a colony of them, it must still be there. but now i have
to pay more attention to david. the copper line slants down, cutting the water,
vibrating slightly.
â€œany action?â€ i ask.
â€œitâ€™s just sort of jigging.â€
â€œthatâ€™s the spoon turning,â€ i say. â€œkeep the tip down; if you feel a nibble wait a
second and then give it a sharp tug, okay?â€
â€œright,â€ he says.
my arms are tired. behind me i can hear the tick tock of the frog hopping up and
hitting its muzzle against the jar lid.
when weâ€™re getting near the sheer cliff i tell him to reel in, weâ€™ll still-fish and he

leam of the spoon wavers up out of the lake. when it skips over the surface
towards us i can see the worm is gone. on one hook is a shred of worm skin; i used
to wonder how the lures with their crude african-idol eyes could deceive the fish,
but perhaps theyâ€™ve learned.
weâ€™re opposite the cliff, grey slab of rock straight as a monument, overhanging
slightly, ledge like a step halfway up, brown rock-lichen growing in the fissures. i
put a lead sinker and a different spoon and a fresh worm on davidâ€™s line and toss it
over; the worm drops, pink, pink-brown, till it disappears in the shadow of the cliff.
the dark torpedo shapes of the fish are seeing it, sniffing at it, prodding it with their
noses. i believe in them the way other people believe in god: i canâ€™t see them but i
know they are there.
â€œkeep right still,â€ i say to anna, whoâ€™s beginning to shift uncomfortably. they

please let the fish be caught.
later when i knew that wouldnâ€™t work, just please be caught, invocation or
hypnosis. he got more fish but i could pretend mine were willing, they had chosen
to die and forgiven me in advance.
i begin to think the frog has failed. but itâ€™s still magic, the rod bends like a
divinerâ€™s and anna shrieks with surprise.
i say â€œkeep the line tight,â€ but david is oblivious, heâ€™s reeling like a mixmaster
and saying â€œwow, wowâ€ to himself and itâ€™s up to the surface, it jumps clear and
hangs in the air like a framed photo over a bar only moving. it dives and pulls, the
line slackens, itâ€™s doubling back trying to shake loose; but when it jumps again
david jerks the rod with his whole body and it sails across and flops into the canoe,
a dumb move, he couldâ€™ve lost it, on top of anna and she lurches, screaming â€œget it
off me! get it off me!â€

 and we almost tip. joe says â€œholy shitâ€ and grabs at the side,
i bend the other way, counterbalancing, david is snatching at it. it slithers over the
canoe ribs, flippering and snapping.
â€œhere,â€ i say, â€œhit it back of the eyes.â€ i reach him the sheathed knife, iâ€™d rather
not kill it myself.
david swipes at it, misses; anna cover her eyes and says â€œugh. ugh.â€ it flops
towards me and i step down on it with my foot and grab the knife and whack it
quickly with the knife handle, crushing the skull, and it trembles stiffly all over,
thatâ€™s done it.
â€œwhat is it?â€ david asks, amazed by what heâ€™s caught but proud too. they are all
laughing, joyful with victory and relief, like the newsreels of parades at the end of
the war, and that makes me glad. their voices bounce off the cliff.

itâ€™s because iâ€™ve killed something, made it dead; but i know thatâ€™s irrational, killing
certain things is all right, food and enemies, fish and mosquitoes; and wasps, when
there are too many of them you pour boiling water down their tunnels. â€œdonâ€™t
bother them and they wonâ€™t bother you,â€ our mother would say when they lit on our
plates. that was before the house was built, we were living outside in tents. our
father said they went in cycles.
â€œneat eh?â€ david says to the others; heâ€™s excited, he wants praise. â€œugh,â€ says
anna, â€œitâ€™s slimy, iâ€™m not going to eat any of it.â€ joe grunts, i wonder if heâ€™s
jealous.
david wants to try for another; itâ€™s like gambling, you only stop if you lose. i
donâ€™t remind him i have no more magic frogs; i get out a worm for him and let him
hook it on himself.

village, guiding. i see itâ€™s claude from the motel, he scowls at us, he feels weâ€™re
poaching on his preserve.
â€œgetting any?â€ one of the americans yells, teeth bared, friendly as a shark.
i say â€œnoâ€ and nudge david with my foot. heâ€™d want to tell, if only to spite them.
the other american throws his cigar butt over the side. â€œthis donâ€™t look like
much of a place,â€ he says to claude.

me. this was never my job; someone else did it, my brother or my father. i cut off
the head and tail and slit the belly and open the fish into its two halves. inside the
stomach is a partly digested leech and some shreds of crayfish. i divide along the
backbone, then along the two lateral lines: four pieces, blueish white, translucent.
the entrails will be buried in the garden, theyâ€™re fertilizer.
as iâ€™m washing the fillets david saunters down to the dock with his toothbrush.
â€œhey,â€ he says, â€œis that my fish?â€ he regards the guts on the plate with interest.
â€œhold it,â€ he says, â€œthatâ€™s a random sample.â€ he goes for joe and the camera and
the two of them solemnly film the fish innards, collapsed bladders and tubes and
soft ropes, rearranging them between takes for better angles. it would never occur
to david to have someone snap him with a brownie camera holding his fish up by
the tail and grinning, nor

hate standing still, waiting for the click.
i dip the fillets in flour and fry them and we eat them with strips of bacon. â€œgood
food, good meat, good god, letâ€™s eat,â€ david says; and later, smacking his lips,
â€œcouldnâ€™t get this in the city.â€
anna says â€œsure you could, frozen. you can get anything there now.â€
after breakfast i go into my room and begin to pack. through the plywood wall i
hear anna walking, pouring more coffee, the creak as david stretches out on the

them into bundles and take them back with me. no one will be living here now and

thatâ€™s what he explores, for one of the big international companies, a prospector; but
i canâ€™t believe in that, nothing heâ€™s done since we grew up is real to me.

maybe theyâ€™re waiting till i come out, theyâ€™ll ask then. if i say i donâ€™t want to they
canâ€™t very well stay; but what reason can i give? i canâ€™t tell them about my father,
betray him; anyway they might think i was making it up. thereâ€™s my work, but they
know i have it with me. i could leave by myself with evans but iâ€™d only get as far as
the village: itâ€™s davidâ€™s car, iâ€™d have to steal the keys, and also, i remind myself, i
never learned to drive.
anna makes a last feeble attempt. â€œiâ€™ll run out of cigarettes.â€
â€œdo you good,â€ david says cheerfully, â€œfilthy habit. get you back into shape.â€
heâ€™s older than we are, heâ€™s over thirty, heâ€™s beginning to worry about that; every

for a moment theyâ€™re startled, they realize iâ€™ve overheard. then david says â€œno

won something: not a war but a lottery.
when evans turns up at the appointed time david and joe go down to the dock to
arrange things with him. i warned them not to say anything about the fish: if they do,
this part of the lake will be swarming with americans, they have an uncanny way of
passing the word, like ants about sugar, or lobsters. after a few minutes i hear the

mouth tongue forming my name, repeating it like a chant. â€¦
then someone knocks on the door. â€œready or not, you must be caught,â€ says a

joe followed me out and watched as i spread the crumbs. he put his fingers on my
arm, frowning at me, which may have meant he wanted to talk to me: speech to him
was a task, a battle, words mustered behind his beard and issued one at a time, heavy
and square like tanks. his hand gripped me in a preliminary spasm, but david was
there with the axe.

man.â€
he wanted to do something useful; and he was right, if we were staying a week we
would need a fresh supply. i asked him to find standing trees, dead but not too old or
rotten, â€œyesâ€™m,â€ he said, giving me a burlesque salute.

hopeless jungle, we wouldnâ€™t do that; in any case the season was over.
david and joe appeared in the long grass outside the fence, one at either end of a
thinnish log. they were proud, theyâ€™d caught something. the log was notched in
many places as though theyâ€™d attacked it.
â€œhi,â€ david called. â€œhowâ€™s the olâ€™ plantation workers?â€
anna stood up. â€œfuck off,â€ she said, squinting at them against the sun.
â€œyouâ€™ve hardly done anything,â€ david said, unquenchable, â€œyou call that a
garden?â€
i measured their axework with my fatherâ€™s summarizing eye.

 in the city he would
shake hands with them, estimating them shrewdly: could they handle an axe, what
did they know about manure? they would stand there embarrassed in their washed
suburban skins and highschool clothes, uncertain what was expected of them.
â€œthatâ€™s great,â€ i said.
david wanted us to get the movie camera and take some footage of both of them
carrying the log, for random samples; he said it would be his cameo appearance.
joe said we couldnâ€™t work the camera. david said all you did was press a button, an
idiot could do it, anyway it might be even better if it was out of focus or
overexposed, it would introduce the element of chance, like a painter throwing paint
at a canvas, it would be organic. but joe said what if we wrecked the camera, who
would pay for it. in the end they stuck the axe in the log, after several tries, and took
turns shooting each other standing beside it, arms folded and one foot on it as if it
was a lion or a rhinoceros.

ng we played bridge, with the set of slightly greasy cards that had
always been there, blue seahorses on one deck, red seahorses on the other. david
and anna played against us. they won easily: joe didnâ€™t know how, exactly, and i
hadnâ€™t played for years. i was never any good; the only part i liked was picking up
the cards and arranging them.
afterwards i waited for anna to walk up to the outhouse with me; usually i went
first, alone. we took both flashlights; they made protective circles of weak yellow
light, moving with our feet as they walked. rustlings, toads in the dry leaves; once
the quick warning thump of a rabbit. the sounds wou

e yellow target from
annaâ€™s flashlight was on the ceiling; it shifted, she was going into their room and i
could hear them, anna breathing, a fast panic sound as though she was running; then
her voice began, not like her real voice but twisted as her face must have been, a
desperate beggarâ€™s whine, please please. i put the pillow over my head, i didnâ€™t want
to listen, i wanted it to be through but it kept on, shut up i whispered but she
wouldnâ€™t. she was praying to herself, it was as if david wasnâ€™t there at all. jesus
jesus oh yes please jesus. then something different, not a word but pure pain, clear
as water, an animalâ€™s at the moment the trap closes.
itâ€™s like death, i thought, the bad part isnâ€™t the thing itself but being a witness. i
suppose they could hear us too, the times before. but i never say anything.

om him, to protect him from
them, save all of them from knowledge. they might start to explore, cut other trails;
already they were beginning to be restless: fire and food, the only two necessities,
were taken care of and there was nothing left to be done. sun rising, drifting across
the sky, shadows changing without help, uninterrupted air, absence of defining
borders, the only break an occasional distant plane, vapour streak, for them it must
have been like living in a hammock.
in the morning david fished from the dock, catching nothing; anna read, she was
on her fourth or fifth paperback. i swept the floor, the broom webbing itself with
long threads, dark and light, from where anna and i brushed our hair in front of the
mirror; then i tried to work. joe stayed on the wall bench, arms wrapped around his
knees in lawn-dwarf position, watching me. every time i glanced up his eyes would
be there, blue as ball point pens or superman; even with my head turned away i
could feel his x-ray vision

people isolated in a blank room who see

after lunch they all sat around expectantly, as though waiting for me to dole out
the crayons and plasticine or regiment the sing-song, tell them what to play. i
searched through the past: what did we do when it was sunny and there was no
work?
â€œhow would you like,â€ i said, â€œto pick some blueberries?â€ offering it as a
surprise; work disguised in some other form, it had to be a game.
they seized on it, glad of the novelty. â€œa groove,â€ david said. anna and i made
peanut butter sandwiches for a mid-afternoon snack; then we basted our noses and
the lobes of our ears with annaâ€™s suntan lotion and started out.
david and anna went in the green canoe, we took the heavier one. they still
couldnâ€™t paddle very well but there wasnâ€™t much wind. i had to use a lot of energy
just to keep us pointed straight, because joe didnâ€™t know how to steer; also he
wouldnâ€™t admit it, which made it harder.
we wavered around the stone point where t

 also i was afraid
of him: the look he gave me as i drew away was one of baffled rage.
we were sitting outside in the chicken wire enclosure; joe was in the sandbox with
his back half-turned to us, scraping together a large mound of sand. heâ€™d finished
his pie, the rest of us were still eating. it was too hot to eat in the house, we had to
keep the stove going for two hours. they had purple mouths and blue teeth which
showed when they talked or laughed.
â€œthatâ€™s the best pie i ever ate,â€ david said. â€œjust like mother used to make.â€ he
smacked his lips and posed, pretending to be a t.v. ad.
â€œstuff it,â€ anna said, â€œyou canâ€™t afford just one measly compliment, can you?â€
davidâ€™s purple mouth grinned. â€œaw,â€ he said, â€œthat was a compliment.â€
â€œthe hell,â€ anna said. â€œiâ€™ve met your mother.â€
david sighed and leaned back against his tree, rolling his eyes to joe for
sympathy. but he got none and so he gazed up at the sky instead. â€œthis is the life,â€ he
said

 after a while. â€œwe ought to start a colony, i mean a community up here, get it
together with some other people, break away from the urban nuclear family. it
wouldnâ€™t be a bad country if only we could kick out the fucking pig americans, eh?
then we could have some peace.â€
nobody answered him; he took off one of his shoes and began scratching the sole
of his foot thoughtfully.
â€œi think it would be a copout,â€ anna said abruptly.
â€œwhat would?â€ david said, overly tolerant, as though sheâ€™d interrupted him in
mid-sentence. â€œkicking out the pigs?â€
â€œoh shit,â€ anna said, â€œyou just wonâ€™t.â€
â€œwhat the hell are you talking about?â€ he said, feigning hurt. but she sat hugging
her knees, smoke breathing through her nostrils. i got up and started to collect the
plates.
â€œit turns me on when she bends over,â€ david said. â€œsheâ€™s got a neat ass. iâ€™m really
into the whole ass thing. joe, donâ€™t you think sheâ€™s got a neat ass?â

â€œyou can have it,â€ joe said. he was levelling the sand mound he had built, he was
still angry.
i scraped the ends of crust into the stove and washed the plates, the water turning
reddish blue, vein colour. the others ambled in; they didnâ€™t feel like playing bridge,
they sat around the table reading detective novels and back issues of magazines,
macleanâ€™s and the national geographic, some of them were ten years old. iâ€™d read
them all so i went into davidâ€™s and annaâ€™s room with a candle to look for more.
i had to climb up on the bed to reach the shelf. there was a high pile of books; i
lifted it down to where the candle was. on top was a layer of paperbacks, the
average kind, but underneath them were some things that were out of place: the
brown leather photo album that ought to have been in a trunk in the city, along with
my motherâ€™s unused wedding presents, tarnished silver bowls and lace tablecloths,
and the scrapbooks we used to draw i

symmetrically in the left. all the rabbits were smiling and some were laughing
hilariously; several were shown eating ice-cream cones from the safety of their
egg-tops. no monsters, no wars, no explosions, no heroism. i couldnâ€™t remember
ever having drawn these pictures. i was disappointed in myself: i must have been a
hedonistic child, i thought, and quite stodgy also, interested in nothing but social
welfare. or perhaps it was a vision of heaven.
behind me someone came into the room, it was david. â€œhey lady,â€ he said,
â€œwhatâ€™re you doing in my bed? you a customer or something?â€
â€œsorry,â€ i said. i put the album back on the shelf but i took the scrapbooks into my
room and hid them under the mattress, i didnâ€™t want them spying.

at night joe kept turned away from me, he wasnâ€™t going to compromise. i ran my
fingers over his furry back to show i wanted a truce, the borders restored to where
theyâ€™d been, but after he twitched me off and grunted irritably i wit

or a large turnip. thereâ€™s more than one way to skin a cat, my father used to say; it
bothered me, i didnâ€™t see why they would want to skin a cat even one way. i stared at
the wall and thought of maxims: two can play that game, marry in haste, repent at
leisure, least said soonest mended, traditional wisdom which was never any help.
at breakfast he ignored me and the others too, hunching over his plate, mumbling
replies.
â€œwhatâ€™s with him?â€ david said. his new beard was sprouting, a brown smudge on
his chin.
â€œshut up,â€ anna said; but she glanced at me, inquisitive, holding me responsible
for it whatever it was.
joe wiped his sweat shirt sleeve across his mouth and went out of the house,
letting the screen door slam behind him.
â€œmaybe heâ€™s constipated,â€ david said, â€œit makes them grouchy. you sure heâ€™s
been getting enough exercise?â€ then he went â€œarf, arfâ€ like popeye, wiggling his
ears.
â€œstupid,â€ anna said fondly

â€œhe went for the trees?â€ paul said, hurt that he hadnâ€™t been consulted: he used to
go too. â€œyou saw him first, before?â€
â€œno,â€ i said, â€œhe was gone when i got here; but he left me a note, more or less.â€
â€œah,â€ he said, glancing nervously over my shoulder into the forest. it was clear
he didnâ€™t believe me.
for lunch we had paulâ€™s cauliflower and some tins, corn and fried ham. during
the canned pears david said â€œwho were those two old guys?â€ he must have seen
them from the window.
â€œit was a man who wanted to buy the place,â€ i said.
â€œi bet he was a yank,â€ david said, â€œi can spot them in a crowded room.â€
â€œyes,â€ i said, â€œbut he was from a wildlife association, thatâ€™s who he was buying it
for.â€
â€œbullshit,â€ david said, â€œhe was a front man for the c.i.a.â€
i laughed. â€œno,â€ i said; i showed him the teenie town card.
but david was serious. â€œyou havenâ€™t seen them i

the big cities and knock out communications and take over, maybe shoot a few kids,
and the movement guerrillas will go into the bush and start blowing up the water
pipelines the yanks will be building in places like this, to get the water down there.â€
he seemed very positive about it, as if it had happened already. i thought about the
survival manuals: if the movement guerillas were anything like david and joe they
would never make it through the winters. they couldnâ€™t get help from the cities,
they would be too far, and the people there would be apathetic, they wouldnâ€™t mind
another change of flag. if they tried at the outlying farms the farmers would take
after them with shotguns. the americans wouldnâ€™t even have to defoliate the trees,
the guerillas would die of starvation and exposure anyway.

drew ornaments, plants with scrolled branches, hearts and stars instead of flowers. i
got so i could draw invisibly, my fingers scarcely moving.
the generals and the historic moments looked better framed. if you put your eye
down close to the photograph they disintegrated into grey dots.
anna was squeezed in beside david on the bench, playing with one of his hands
while he talked. â€œdid i ever tell you that you have murdererâ€™s thumb?â€ she said.
â€œdonâ€™t interrupt,â€ he said, but when she made a whimpering face he said â€œyep,
you did, almost every day,â€ and patted her arm.
â€œitâ€™s spread flat at the end,â€ she said, explaining to us.
â€œi hope you didnâ€™t sell out,â€ david said to me. i shook my head. â€œgood girl,â€ he

one of the schmuckiest people i know.â€
i looked around at her: her voice was like fingernails, iâ€™d never heard her talk that
way about david.
â€œwhy?â€ i said. â€œwhatâ€™s wrong?â€ he hadnâ€™t said anything at lunch that could have
upset her.
â€œi guess you think heâ€™s hot for you.â€ her mouth stretched down tight with the lips
inside, a toadâ€™s.
â€œno,â€ i said, bewildered, â€œwhy would i think that?â€
â€œthose things he says, you know, like about your ass and being fully packed,â€ she
said impatiently.
â€œi thought he was teasing.â€ i had thought that too, it was just a habit like picking

the slop pail was full; i carried it to the garden to pour the dirty water into the
trench. joe was lying by himself on the dock, face down; when i came to rinse the
pail he didnâ€™t move. anna passed me on the steps, wearing her orange bikini, oiled
for her sun ritual.
in the cabin i set the pail under the counter. david was pondering his chin bristles
in the mirror; he slid his arm half around me and said in a guttural voice, â€œcome
wiz me to zee outhouse.â€
â€œnot right now,â€ i said, â€œi have to do some work.â€
he mimed regret. â€œah well,â€ he said, â€œsome other time.â€
i took out my samsonite case and sat down at the table. he leaned over my
shoulder. â€œwhereâ€™s old joe?â€
â€œdown on the dock,â€ i said.
â€œhe seems out of sorts,â€ david said, â€œmaybe he has worms; when you get back to

pointed out, they stay under.
the numbers were a system, a game; i would play it with him, it would make him
seem less dead. i lined up the pages and compared the notes, carefully as a jeweller.
on one of the drawings, another antlered figure, i finally spotted the key: a name i
recognized, white birch lake where we went bass fishing, it was connected to the
main lake by a portage. i went into davidâ€™s and annaâ€™s room where the map of the
district was tacked to the wall. marked on a point of land was a tiny red x and a
number, identical with the number on the drawing. the printed name was different,
lac des verges blanches, the government had been translating all the english names
into french ones, though the indian names remained the same. scattered here and
there were other xs, like a treasure map.
i wanted to go there and verify, match the drawing with reality; that way iâ€™d be
sure

 iâ€™d followed the rules and done it right. i could disguise it as a fishing trip,
david hadnâ€™t caught anything since his first attempt, though heâ€™d been trying. weâ€™d
have time to go there and get back with two days to spare.
i heard annaâ€™s voice approaching, singing, the words trailing off as her breath
gave out climbing the steps. i went back to the main room.
â€œhi,â€ she said, â€œdo i look burnt?â€
she was pink now, parboiled, white showing around the orange edges of her suit,
neck dividing body colour from applied face colour. â€œa little,â€ i said.

 with me there had been an accident and i came apart. the other
half, the one locked away, was the only one that could live; i was the wrong half,
detached, terminal. i was nothing but a head, or no, something minor like a severed
thumb; numb. at school they used to play a joke, they would bring little boxes with
cotton wool in them and a hole cut in the bottom; they would poke their finger
through the hole and pretend it was a dead finger.
chapter thirteen
we pushed off from the dock at ten by davidâ€™s watch. the sky was watercolour
blue, the cloud bunches white on the backs and grey on the bellies. wind from the
stern, waves overtaking, my arms lifting and swinging, light and automatic as
though they knew what to do. i was at the front, figurehead; behind me joe shoved at
the water, the canoe surged forward.
the landmarks passed, unscrolling, one-dimensional map thickening into stone
and wood around us: point, cliff, leaning dead tree, heron island with the intricate
bird silhouettes, bl

peelings and tin cans and a rancid bulge of greasy paper, the tracks of humans. it
was like dogs pissing on a fence, as if the endlessness, anonymous water and
unclaimed land, compelled them to leave their signature, stake their territory, and
garbage was the only thing they had to do it with. i picked up the pieces of clutter
and piled them to one side, i would burn them afterwards.
â€œthatâ€™s disgusting,â€ anna said. â€œhow can you touch it?â€
â€œitâ€™s the sign of a free country,â€ david said. â€œgermany under hitler was very
tidy.â€
we didnâ€™t need to use the axe, the island was covered with dry sticks, branches
discarded from trees. i boiled the water and made tea and we had chicken noodle
soup, out of a package, and sardines and tinned applesauce.
we sat in the shade, white smoke and the smell of scorching orange peels
wrapping over us when the wind swerved. i hooked the billy tin off the fire and
poured the tea; ashes and bits of twig were floating in it.

thought we were yanks insulting their queen. but i said she was our queen too so
we had the right, and they ended up buying us a drink.â€
â€œi think it would be more fair,â€ anna said, â€œif you did it, â€˜ladies and gentlemen,
up the queen and the duke.â€™ â€œ
â€œnone of that womenâ€™s lib,â€ david said, his eyes lidding, â€œor youâ€™ll be out on

get off on that, theyâ€™re roving the streets in savage bands armed with garden
shears.â€
â€œiâ€™ll join if you will,â€ anna said to me, joking.
i said â€œi think men ought to be superior.â€ but neither of them heard the actual
words; anna looked at me as though iâ€™d betrayed her and said â€œwow, are you ever
brainwashed,â€ and david said â€œwant a job?â

with tiny wounds, like an addictâ€™s. they slipped the needle into the vein and i was
falling down, it was like diving, sinking from one layer of darkness to a deeper,
deepest; when i rose up through the anaesthetic, pale green and then daylight, i could
remember nothing.
â€œdonâ€™t bother him,â€ anna said.
â€œor maybe iâ€™ll make it a short course this time,â€ david said. â€œfor the
businessmen how to open the playboy centrefold with the left hand only, keeping the
right free for action, for the housewives how to switch on the t.v. and switch off
their heads, thatâ€™s all they need to know, then we can go home.â€
but he wouldnâ€™t, he needed to be rescued himself and neither of us would put on

oozing tears like a melting popsicle; menâ€™s magazines were about pleasure, cars
and women, the skins bald as inner tubes. in a way it was a relief, to be exempt from
feeling.
â€œthe trouble with you is you hate women,â€ anna said savagely; she threw the rest
of her tea and the tealeaves out of her tin cup into the lake, they hit with a splat.
david grinned. â€œthatâ€™s what they call a delayed reaction,â€ he said. â€œgoose anna
in the bum and three days later she squeals. cheer up, youâ€™re so cute when youâ€™re

against her face and asked her how she would like to be raped by a porcupine. â€œyou
know that one?â€ he said. â€œhow do porcupines do it? carefully!â€ anna smiled at him
as though he was a brain-damaged child.

g the slippery logs as far as we could, then clambered
out and waded, dragging the canoes up over, soaking our shoes. it was bad for the
canoes, it scraped the keels. there were other paint marks, recent.
we unloaded the canoes and i knotted the paddles into position across the thwarts.
they said they would take the tents and the canoes and anna and i could take the
packs and the leftovers, the fishing rods and the tackle box with the jar of frogs iâ€™d
caught that morning, the movie equipment. david had insisted on it, though i warned
him we might tip.
â€œwe have to use up the film,â€ he said, â€œweâ€™ve only got it rented for another
week.â€
anna said â€œbut there wonâ€™t be anything you want,â€ and david said â€œhow do you
know what i want?â€
â€œthereâ€™s an indian rock painting,â€ i said, â€œprehistoric. you might take that.â€ a
point of interest, it would go with the bottle villa and the stuffed moose family, a
new anomaly for their collection.
â€œwow,â€ david said, â€œis there?

neither of them had portaged before; we had to help them lift and balance the
canoes. i said maybe they should double up, both of them under one canoe, but
david insisted they could do it the real way. i said they should be careful; if the
canoe slipped sideways and you didnâ€™t get out in time it would break your neck.
â€œwhatâ€™s the matter,â€ he said, â€œdonâ€™t you trust us?â€
the trail hadnâ€™t been brushed out recently but there were deep footprints,
bootprints, in the muddy places. two sets, they pointed in but not out: whoever they
were, americans maybe, spies, they were still in there.
the packs were heavy, food for three days in case the wea

feet squishing in the wet shoes as i walked.
the portage was up over a steep ridge of rock, watershed, then down through
ferns and saplings to an oblong pond, a shallow mud-hole weâ€™d have to paddle
across to reach the second portage. anna and i got there first and set down the
packs; anna had time to smoke half a cigarette before david and joe came
staggering down the trail, bumping into the sides like blinkered horses. we held the
canoes and they crouched out from under, they were pink and breathless.
â€œbetter be fish in there,â€ david said, sleeving off his forehead.
â€œthe next oneâ€™s shorter,â€ i told them.
the water was covered with lily pads, the globular yellow lilies with their thick
centre snouts pushing up from among them. it swarmed with leeches, i could see
them undulating sluggishly under the brown surface. w

we reached the second portage, marked by a trapperâ€™s blaze weathered to the
colour of the tree. i got out and stood holding the canoe steady while joe climbed
forward.
it was behind me, i smelled it before i saw it; then i heard the flies. the smell was
like decaying fish. i turned around and it was hanging upside down by a thin blue
nylon rope tied round its feet and looped over a tree branch, its wings fallen open. it
looked at me with its mashed eye.

â€œheavy,â€ david said. â€œwhat is it?â€
â€œa dead bird,â€ anna said. she held her nose with two fingers.
i said â€œitâ€™s a heron. you canâ€™t eat them.â€ i couldnâ€™t tell how it had been done,
bullet, smashed with a stone, hit with a stick. this would be a good place for herons,
they would come to fish in the shallow water, standing on one leg and striking with
the long spear bill. they must have got it before it had time to rise.
â€œwe need that,â€ david said, â€œwe can put it next to the fish guts.â€

â€œthat wonâ€™t show in the movie,â€ david said, â€œyou can stand it for five minutes, it
looks so great, you have to admit.â€ they began to set up the camera; anna and i
waited, sitting on the packs.
i saw a beetle on it, blueblack and oval; when the camera whirred it burrowed in
under the feathers. carrion beetle, death beetle. why had they strung it up like a
lynch victim, why didnâ€™t they just throw it away like the trash? to prove they could
do it, they had the power to kill. otherwise it was valueless: beautiful from a

tree cancer, but not yet. the wind swayed the tops of them; it was blowing crossways
over the lake. the surface corrugated, water flapping against the shore.
we got into the canoes again and paddled towards the bend; i remembered there
was an open space where we could camp. on the way there were several abandoned
beaver lodges shaped like dilapidated beehives or wooden haystacks; i memorized
them, the bass liked underwater tangle.
we were later than i had planned, the sun was red and weakening. david wanted to
fish right away but i said we had to pitch the tents and collect wood first. there was
garbage at this site too but it was ancient garbage, the labels on the beer bottles
illegible, the cans corroded. i gathered it up and took it with me when i went back
among the trees to dig the toilet hole.

nish, at
that time i was afraid there was a machine that could make people vanish like that
too, go nowhere, like a camera that could steal not only your soul but your body
also. levers and buttons, triggers, the machines sent them up as roots sent up
flowers; tiny circles and oblongs, logic become visible, you couldnâ€™t tell in advance
what would happen if you pressed them.
i showed the three of them where i had dug the hole. â€œwhere do you sit?â€ anna
asked, squeamish.
â€œon the ground,â€ david said, â€œgood for you, toughen you up. you could use an
ass job.â€ anna poked him on the belt buckle and said â€œflab,â€ imitating him.
i opened more tins and heated them, baked beans and peas, and we ate them with
smokey tea. from the rock where i washed the dishes i could see part of a tent, in
among the cedars at the distant end of the lake: their bunker. binoculars trained on
me, i could feel the eye rays, cross of the rifle sight on my forehead, in case i made
a false move.

atient, he wanted his moneyâ€™s worth, what heâ€™d come for. anna
said sheâ€™d stay at the campsite: fishing didnâ€™t interest her. we left her the insect spray
and the three of us got into the green canoe with the fishing rods. i put the frog jar in
the stern where i could reach it. david was facing me this time; joe sat in the bow, he
was going to fish too, though he didnâ€™t have a licence.
the wind had dwindled, the lake was pink and orange. we went along the shore,
birches cool, overhanging us, ice pillars. i was dizzy, too much water and sun glare,
the skin of my face was shimmering as though burned, afterglow. in my head when i
closed my eyes the shape of the heron dangled, upside down. i should have buried it.
the canoe steered over to the nearest beaver lodge and they ti

the tackle box and clipped a lure onto davidâ€™s line. he was happy, whistling under
his breath.
â€œhey, maybe iâ€™ll hook a beaver,â€ he said. â€œthe national emblem. thatâ€™s what they
shouldâ€™ve put on the flag instead of a maple leaf, a split beaver; iâ€™d salute that.â€
â€œwhy should it be split?â€ i said. it was like skinning the cat, i didnâ€™t get it.
he looked exasperated. â€œitâ€™s a joke,â€ he said; and when i still didnâ€™t laugh,
â€œwhereâ€™ve you been living? itâ€™s slang for cunt. the maple beaver for ever, that

es. you draw on the wall whatâ€™s important to you, what youâ€™re hunting. they had
enough food, no need to draw tinned peas and argentine corned beef, and thatâ€™s
what they wanted instead during those monotonous and not at all idyllic trips up and
down the lake, nothing to do but play cards, they must have detested it, back and
forth chained to the logs. all of them dead now or old, they probably hated each
other.
the bass struck on both lines at once. they fought hard, the rods doubled over.
david landed one but joe let his escape into the labyrinth of sticks, where it wound
the line around a branch and snapped it.
â€œhey,â€ david was saying, â€œkill it for me.â€ the bass was fierce, it was flipping
around the inside of the canoe. it spat water from its undershot jaw with a hissing
sound; it was either terrified or enraged, i couldnâ€™t tell which.
â€œyou do it,â€ i said, handing him the knife. â€œi showed you how, remember?â€

excuse my father used to say, a favourite maxim.
while they admired davidâ€™s murder, cadaver, i took the bottle with the frogs in it
out of the tackle box and unscrewed the top; they slipped into the water, green with
black leopard spots and gold eyes, rescued. highschool, each desk with a tray on it
and a frog, exhaling ether, spread and pinned flat as a doily and slit open, the organs
explored and clipped out, the detached heart still gulping slowly like an adamâ€™s
apple, no martyrâ€™s letters on it, the intestines messy string. pickled cat pumped full

int, two of them in a silver canoe; they were
barging towards us. i assessed them, their disguises: they werenâ€™t the bloated
middle-aged kind, those would stick to powerboats and guides; they were younger,
trimmer, with the candid, tanned astronaut finish valued by the magazines. when
they were even with us their mouths curved open, showing duplicate sets of teeth,
white and even as false ones.
â€œgettinâ€™ any?â€ the front man said with a midwestern accent; traditional greeting.
â€œlots,â€ david said, smiling back. i was expecting him to say something to them,
insult them, but he didnâ€™t. they were quite large.
â€œus too,â€ the front one said. â€œwe been in here three-four days, they been biting
the whole time, caught our limit every day.â€ they had a starry flag like all of them,
a miniature decal sticker on the canoe bow. to show us we were in occupied
territory.
â€œwell, see ya,â€ the back one said. their canoe moved past us towards the next
beaver house.

senseless killing, it was a game; after the war theyâ€™d been bored.
the sunset was fading, at the other side of the sky the black was coming up. we
took the fish back, four of them by now, and i cut a y-shaped sapling stringer to go
through the gills.
â€œpoo,â€ anna said to us, â€œyou smell like a fish market.â€
david said â€œwish we had some beer. maybe we could get some off the yanks,
theyâ€™re the type.â€
i went down to the lake with the bar of soap to wash the fish blood off my hands.
anna followed me.
â€œgod,â€ she said, â€œwhatâ€™m i going to do? i forgot my makeup, heâ€™ll kill me.â€
i studied her: in the twilight her face was grey. â€œmaybe he wonâ€™t notice,â€ i said.
â€œheâ€™ll notice, donâ€™t you worry. not now maybe, it hasnâ€™t all rubbed off, but in the

she would laugh about it but the story seemed to me then chilly and sad, the failure
unbearable.
â€œsometimes i think heâ€™d like me to die,â€ anna said, â€œi have dreams about it.â€
we walked back and i built up the fire and mixed some cocoa, using powdered
milk. everything was dark now except for the flames, sparks going up in spirals,
coals underneath pulsing red when the night breeze hit them. we sat on the
groundsheets, david with his arm around anna, joe and i a foot apart.
â€œthis reminds me of girl guides,â€ anna said in the cheerful voice i once thought
was hers. she began to sing, the notes hesitant, quavering:
thereâ€™ll be bluebirds over
the white cliffs of dover
tomorrow, when the worldis free. â€¦
the words went out towards the shadows, smoke-thin, evaporating. across the lake
a barred owl was calling, quick and soft like a wing beating against the eardrum,
cutting across the pattern of her voice, negating

 her. she glanced behind her: she felt
it.
â€œnow everybody sing,â€ she said, clapping her hands.
david said â€œwell, goodnight children,â€ and he and anna went into their tent. the
tent lit up from inside for a moment, flashlight, then went out.
â€œcoming?â€ joe said.
â€œin a minute.â€ i wanted to give him time to go to sleep.
i sat in the dark, the stroking sound of the night lake surrounding me. in the
distance the americansâ€™ campfire glowed, a dull red cyclops eye: the enemy lines. i
wished evil towards them: let them suffer, i prayed, tip their canoe, burn them, rip
them open. owl: answ

straight down, lake of the edge. i woke the others.
after iâ€™d cleaned the fish i dipped them in flour and fried them and boiled coffee.
the fish flesh was white, blue-veined; it tasted like underwater and reeds. they ate,
not talking much; they hadnâ€™t slept well.
annaâ€™s face in the daylight was dried and slightly shrivelled without its cream
underfilm and pink highlights; her nose was sunburned and she had prune crinkles
under her eyes. she kept turned away from david, but he didnâ€™t seem to notice, he
didnâ€™t say anything, except when she knocked her foot against his cup and tipped
some of his coffee out onto the ground. then all he said was â€œwatch it anna, youâ€™re
getting sloppy.â€
â€œdo you want to fish any more this morning?â€ i said to david, but he shook his
head: â€œletâ€™s go take that rock painting.â€

forest. they were not seeds, in the spring no minnows woul

i looked for a dip in the shore, a line that would fit the mapline. it was there, site
of the x, unmistakable: cliff with sheer face, the kind they would have chosen to
paint on, no other flat rock in sight. he had been here and long before him the
original ones, the first explorers, leaving behind them their sign, word, but not its
meaning. i leaned forward, scanning the cliff surface; we let the canoes drift in
sideways till they scraped the stone.
â€œwhere is it?â€ david said; and to joe, â€œyouâ€™ll have to steady the canoe, thereâ€™s no
way we can shoot from land.â€
â€œit might be hard to see at first,â€ i said, â€œfaded. it ought to be right here
somewhere.â€ but it wasnâ€™t: no man with antlers, nothing like red paint or even a
stain, the rock surface extended under my hand, coarsegrained, lunar, broken only
by a pink-white vein of quartz that ran across it, a diagonal marking the slow tilt of
the land; nothing human.

was wrong. iâ€™d reasoned it out, unravelled the clues in his puzzle the way he taught
us and theyâ€™d led nowhere. i felt as though heâ€™d lied to me.
â€œwho told you about it?â€ david said, cross-examining.
â€œi just thought it was here,â€ i said. â€œsomeone mentioned it. maybe it was another
lake.â€ for a moment i knew: of course, the lake had been flooded, it would be
twenty feet under water. but that was the other lake, this one was part of a separate
system, the watershed divided them. the map said heâ€™d found them on the main lake
too; according to the letter heâ€™d been taking pictures of them. but when iâ€™d searched
the cabin there had been no camera. no drawings,

rious with them, theyâ€™d disguised themselves. â€œwhatâ€™re you doing with
that flag on your boat then?â€ i said, my voice loud, it surprised them. the front one
withdrew his hand.
â€œoh that,â€ he said with a shrug. â€œiâ€™m a mets fan, have been for years, i always
root for the underdog. bought that when i was down there for the game, the year
they won the pennant.â€ i looked more closely at the sticker: it wasnâ€™t a flag at all, it
was a blue and white oblong with red printing, go mets.
david and anna had caught up with us. â€œyou a mets fan?â€ david said. â€œout of
sight.â€ he slid his canoe in beside theirs and they shook hands.
but theyâ€™d killed the heron anyway. it doesnâ€™t matter what country theyâ€™re from, my
head said, theyâ€™re still americans, theyâ€™re whatâ€™s in store for us, what we are turning
into. they spread themselves like a virus, they get into the brain and take over the
cells and the cells change from inside and the ones that have the disease canâ€™t tell

â€; we knew it helped. all possible horrors were
measured against him. but hitler was gone and the thing remained; whatever it was,
even then, moving away from them as they smirked and waved goodbye, i was
asking are the americans worse than hitler. it was like cutting up a tapeworm, the
pieces grew.
we landed at the campsite and rolled up the sleeping bags and struck the tents and
packed them. i covered the toilet hole and smoothed it, camouflaging it with sticks
and needles. leave no traces.
david wanted to stay and have lunch with the americans and talk about baseball
scores, but i said the wind was against us, we would need the time. i hurried them, i
wanted to get away, from my own anger as well as from the friendly metal killers.
we reached the first portage at eleven. my feet moved over the rocks and mud,
stepping in my own day-old footprints, backtracking; in my brain the filaments,
trails reconnected and branched, we killed other people besides hitler, before my
brother went to sc

by the lake to shampoo the smoke out of her hair. i
pulled on a sweat shirt in case there were americans. before leaving i searched
once more for his camera, the one he must have used to take the photographs, but it
wasnâ€™t there; he must have had it with him. at the time, the last time.
i had started down the steps before i saw them. the three of them were on the
dock, split into parts by the treetrunk bars. anna was kneeling in her orange bikini,
with a towel draped over her head like a nun; david was standing over her, hands on
hips. joe was further back with the movie camera, sitting on the dock with his legs
dangling, head averted as if waiting politely for them to be through. when i heard
what they were saying i stood still. the canoes were there and i needed one of them
but it was too dangerous. it was a calm day, the sound carried.
â€œcome on, take it off,â€ david said; his light-humour voice.
â€œi wasnâ€™t bothering you.â€ anna was muted, avoiding.
â€œit wonâ€™t hurt you, we nee

â€œwhat the hell for?â€ anna was peevish now, her veiled head upturned; her eyes

everything, thereâ€™s nothing left here now for them to take pictures of except each
other, next it will be me. â€œyouâ€™ll go in beside the dead bird, itâ€™s your chance for
stardom, youâ€™ve always wanted fame. youâ€™ll get to be on educational t.v.â€ he added
as though it was a special bribe.
â€œoh for christâ€™s sake,â€ anna said. she picked up her murder mystery again and
pretended to read.
â€œcome on, we need a naked lady with big tits an

same tender voice; i recognized that menacing gentleness, at school it always went
before the trick, the punchline.
â€œlook, will you leave me alone?â€ anna said. â€œiâ€™m minding my own business,
mind yours why donâ€™t you.â€ she stood up, her towel sliding off, and tried to get past
him to the land, but he sidestepped in front of her.
â€œi wonâ€™t take her if she doesnâ€™t want to,â€ joe said.
â€œitâ€™s token resistance,â€ david said, â€œshe wants to, sheâ€™s an exhibitionist at heart.
she likes her lush bod, donâ€™t you? even if she is getting too fat.â€
â€œdonâ€™t think i donâ€™t know what youâ€™re trying to do,â€ anna said, as though sheâ€™d
guessed a riddle. â€œyouâ€™re trying to humiliate me.â€
â€œwhatâ€™s humiliating about your body, darling?â€ david said caressingly. â€œwe all
love it, you ashamed of it? thatâ€™s pretty stingy of you, you should share the wealth;
not that you donâ€™t.â€
anna was furious now

iâ€™ll have to take it off for you.â€
â€œleave her alone,â€ joe said, swinging his legs, bored or excited, it was
impossible to tell.
i wanted to run down to the dock and stop them, fighting was wrong, we werenâ€™t
allowed to, if we did both sides got punished as in a real war. so we battled in secret,
undeclared, and after a while i no longer fought back because i never won. the only
defence was flight, invisibility. i sat do

â€œshut up, sheâ€™s my wife,â€ david said. his hand clamped down above her elbow.
she jerked away, then i saw his arms go around her as if to kiss her and she was in
the air, upside down over his shoulder, hair hanging in damp ropes. â€œokay
twatface,â€ he said, â€œis it off or into the lake?â€
annaâ€™s fists grabbed bunches of his shirt. â€œif i go in, you go in too.â€ the words
spurted from behind her fallen hair, she was kicking, i couldnâ€™t see whether she was
laughing or crying.
â€œshoot,â€ david said to joe, and to anna

joe swivelled the camera and trained it on them like a bazooka or a strange
instrument of torture and pressed the button, lever, sinister whirr.
â€œall right,â€ anna said under its coercion, â€œyou shmuck bastard, god damn you.â€
he set her down and stepped aside. her arms, elbows out, struggled with the fastener
like a beetleâ€™s on its back and the top dropped away: i saw her cut in half, one breast
on either side of a thin tree.
â€œbottoms too,â€ david said as though to a recalcitrant child. anna glanced at him,
contemptuous, and bent. â€œlook sexy now, move it; give us a little dance.â€
anna stood for a moment, brown-red with yellow fur and white markings like
underwear, glaring at them. then she stuck her middle finger in the air at them and
ran to the end of the dock and jumped into the lake. it was a bellyflop, the water
splattered out like a dropped egg. she came up with her hair in streaks over her
forehead and started to swim around t

â€œget that?â€ david said mildly over his shoulder.
â€œsome of it,â€ joe said. â€œmaybe you could order her to do it again.â€ i thought he
was being sarcastic but i wasnâ€™t sure. he began to unscrew the camera from the
tripod.
i could hear anna splashing and then stumbling below on the sand point; she was
really crying now, her indrawn breaths rasping. the bushes rustled, she swore; then
she appeared over the top of the hill, she must have climbed up by holding on to the
leaning trees. her pink face was dissolvi

one at a time they were safer; i went down for the canoe.
â€œhi,â€ he said, â€œhow goes it?â€ he didnâ€™t know iâ€™d been watching. he had his shoes
off and was picking at a toenail as though nothing had happened.
david is like me, i thought, we are the ones that donâ€™t know how to love, there is
something essential missing in us, we were born that way, madame at the store with
one hand, atrophy of the heart. joe and anna are lucky, they do it badly and suffer
because of it: but itâ€™s better to see than to be blind, even though that way you had to
let in the crimes and atrocities too. or perhaps we are normal and the ones who can
love are freaks, they have an extra organ, like the vestigial eye in the forehe

i wanted to search for it but david was jogging down the path from the outhouse.

and talk. i stood up and walked down the rest of the steps and ducked into the trail

for it, i really do.â€
â€œthatâ€™s all right,â€ i said; i knew he was lying.
they sat around the table in the regular places and i served dinner. there hadnâ€™t
been any lunch but no one mentioned that.
â€œwhat time is evans coming tomorrow?â€ i said.
â€œten, ten-thirty,â€ david said. â€œhave a nice afternoon?â€ he said to anna. joe stuck
a new potato with his fork and put it into his mouth.
â€œfantastic,â€ anna said. â€œi got some sun and finished my book, then i had a long
talk with joe and went for a stroll.â€ joe chewed, his closed mouth moving, silent
refutation. â€œand you?â€

i wouldnâ€™t.â€ i wanted to tell her i hadnâ€™t acted against her.
her eyes flicked from him to me. â€œthat was pure of you,â€ she said. iâ€™d made a
mistake, she resented me because i hadnâ€™t given in, it commented on her.
â€œsheâ€™s pure all right,â€ david said, â€œsheâ€™s a little purist.â€
â€œjoe told me she wonâ€™t put out for him any more,â€ anna said, still looking at me.
joe didnâ€™t say anything; he was eating another potato.
â€œshe hates men,â€ david said lightly. â€œeither that or she wants to be one. right?â€

would have brought it here especially for me and hidden it where i would discover
it when i was ready; like my fatherâ€™s puzzle it would mediate, we cannot approach
them directly. i dried the dishes as anna washed, inspecting each one to make sure it
was familiar. but nothing had been added since iâ€™d been here, the gift was not a dish.
it wasnâ€™t anywhere in the main room. when weâ€™d finished i went into davidâ€™s and
annaâ€™s room: her leather jacket was there, hanging up, it hadnâ€™t been put back since
the trip. i examined the pockets; there was nothing in them but an empty metal
aspirin container and an ancient kleenex, and the husks from sunflower seeds; and a
charred filter from one of annaâ€™s cigarettes, which i dropped on the floor and
crushed with my foot.

i heard a motor droning from down the lake, a different pitch, deeper than a
powerboat.
â€œhey look,â€ anna called from the main room, â€œa big boat!â€ we went out on the
point: it was a police launch like the ones driven by the game wardens, they were
checking us the way they used to, to see if we had any dead fish and a licence to go
with them; it was routine.
the launch slowed and drew into the dock. david was down there anyway, i
would let him meet it, he was the one with the papers. i re-entered the house and
stood by the window. anna, inquisitive, sauntered down to join them.
there were two men, police or probably game wardens, they were wearing
ordinary clothes; and a third man, blond, claude from the village probably, and a
fourth one, older, the size of paul. it was odd that paul was on the launch: if he were
coming for a visit he would bring his own boat. david shook hands with them and

path and the talking started over again; annaâ€™s head turned up towards me.
then i saw david hurrying, taking the hill steps two at a time. the screen door
banged shut behind him. â€œthey found your father,â€ he said, breathing hard from the
climb. he squinted his face, as if to show sympathy.
the door slammed again, it was anna; he put his arm around her and they both
studied me with the intent pouncing look theyâ€™d had at supper.
â€œoh,â€ i said. â€œwhere?â€
â€œsome american guys found him in the lake. they were fishing, they hooked him
by mistake; the body was unrecognizable but

wouldâ€™ve been found sooner.â€ his eyes gloating.
it was clever of him to have guessed the missing camera, since iâ€™d told them
nothing. he must have thought quickly in order to make it all up in such a short
time: i knew it was a lie, he was doing it to get back at me. â€œdid they ask to see your

â€œyou should take the canoes up before he comes,â€ i say when iâ€™m back down.
â€œthey go in the toolshed.â€
â€œright,â€ david says. he consults his watch, but they donâ€™t get up. they have the
camera out, theyâ€™re discussing the movie; the zipper bag of equipment is beside
them, the tripod, the reels of film in their canisters.
â€œi figure we can start cutting it in two or three weeks,â€ david says, his version of
a pro. â€œweâ€™ll take it into the lab first thing.â€
â€œthereâ€™s part of a reel left,â€ anna says. â€œyou should get her, you got me but you
never got her.â€ she looks at me, fumes ascending from her

 nose and mouth.
â€œnow thatâ€™s an idea,â€ david says. â€œthe rest of us are in it, sheâ€™s the only one who
isnâ€™t.â€ he assesses me. â€œwhere would we fit her in though? we donâ€™t have anyone
fucking yet; but iâ€™d have to do it,â€ he says to joe, â€œwe need you running the camera.â€
â€œi could run the camera,â€ anna says, â€œyou could both do it,â€ and everyone laughs.
they get up after a while and hoist the red canoe, one at each end, and carry it up
the hill. i stay with anna on the dock.
â€œis my nose peeling?â€ she says, rubbin

sters of film.
â€œwhatâ€™re you doing?â€ anna says, listlessly however.
i unwind the film, standing full in the sun, and let it spiral into the lake. â€œyou
better not do that,â€ anna says, â€œtheyâ€™ll kill you.â€ but she doesnâ€™t interfere, she
doesnâ€™t call them.
when iâ€™ve unravelled the reels i open the back of the camera. the film coils onto
the sand under the water, weighted down by its containers; the invisible captured
images are swimming away into the lake like tadpoles, joe and david beside their
defeated log, axemen, arms folded, anna with no clothes on jumping off the end of
the dock, finger up, hundreds of tiny naked annas no longer bottled and shelved.
i study her to see if her release has made any difference, but the green eyes regard
me unaltered from the enamel face. â€œtheyâ€™ll get you,â€ she says, doleful as a
prophet. â€œyou shouldnâ€™t have done it.â€
theyâ€™re at the top of the hill now, coming back for the other canoe. i run quickly
towards it, flip it over

right side up, throw a paddle inside and drag it along the
dock.
â€œhey!â€ david calls. â€œwhatâ€™re you doing?â€ theyâ€™re almost here, anna watches
me, biting a knuckle, she canâ€™t decide whether or not to tell: if she keeps quiet theyâ€™ll
treat her as an accomplice.
i slide the canoe stern first into the water, squat, step in, shove.
â€œshe dumped out your film,â€ anna says behind me.
i push the blade into the water, i donâ€™t turn, i can hear them peering down into the
lake.
â€œshit,â€ david says, â€œshit, shit, oh shit, why the shit didnâ€™t you stop her?â€

iâ€™m as far as the sand point i look back. anna stands, arms slack at her sides,
uninvolved; david is kneeling, his hands fishing in the water, pulling up the film in
spaghetti handfuls though he must know itâ€™s futile, everything has escaped.
joe is not there. he appears then at the top of the sand cliff, running, halting. he
yells my name, furiously: if he had a rock he would throw it.
the canoe glides, carrying the two of us, around past the leaning trees and out of
range. itâ€™s too late for them to get the other canoe and follow; probably they havenâ€™t
thought of it, surprise attacks

 to show their teeth and happiness;
rubber plantations and deserted temples, jungle crawling over the serene carved
gods. ring from a wet cup on the cover, printed there yesterday or ten years ago.
i open a can of peaches and eat two of the yellow fibrous halves, sugary juice
dribbling from the spoon. then i lie down on the couch and sleep descends over my
face, black oblong, dreamless.
when i wake up the diffused light outside is further west, it feels late, it must be
almost six, dinner hour; david had the only watch. hunger is there in me, a
contained whimper. i unhook the window and climb out, one foot on the wobbling
handbarrow, scraping my knee as i let myself drop to the ground. i should build a
ladder; but there are no implements, no boards.
i go down to the garden. iâ€™ve forgotten the knife and the bowl but they arenâ€™t
needed, fingers will do. i unlatch the gate, the chicken wire walls are around me;
outside the fence the trees droop as though wilting, the plants inside are pale

n, their false skins
flapping. they cluster, they chitter and sizzle like a speeded-up tape, the forks and
spoons on the ends of their arms waving excitedly. perhaps they think i drowned
myself, that would be the kind of blunder they would make.
keep quiet i say, i bite into my arm but i canâ€™t hold it back, the laughter extrudes.
it startles me, i stop at once but itâ€™s too late, theyâ€™ve heard me. rubber feet stomping
off the dock and bulletproof heads moving towards me, who could they be, david
and joe, claude from the village, evans, malmstrom the spy, the americans, the
humans, theyâ€™re here because i wouldnâ€™t sell. i donâ€™t own it, nobody owns it i tell
them, you donâ€™t have to kill me. rabbitâ€™s choices: freeze, take the chance they wonâ€™t
see you; then bolt.
i have a good start on them and no shoes. i run silently, dodging branches,
heading for the path to the swamp, the canoe is there, i can easily reach it first. on
the open lake they could cut me off with the motorboat

n, i can walk on the paths. i am
the only one left alive on the island.
they were here though, i trust that. i saw them and they spoke to me, in the other
language.
iâ€™m not hungry any more but i trudge back to the cabin and climb through the
window again and open a tin of yellow beans. to prefer life, i owe them that. i sit
crosslegged on the wall bench and eat the beans out of the can with my fingers, a
few at a time, too much at first is bad. junk on the floor, things broken, did i do that?
david and anna were here, they slept in the far bedroom; i remember them, but
indistinctly and with nostalgia, as i remember people i once knew. they live in the
city now, in a different time. i can remember him, fake husband, more clearly
though, and now i feel nothing for him but sorrow. he was neither of the things i
believed, he was only a normal man, middle-aged, second-rate, selfish and kind in
the average proportions; but i was not prepared for the average, its needless
cruelties and lies. my

the gate and retreat behind the trees, white birches clumped
beside the path, not hurrying, not running away but cautious.
the motor cuts, the nose of the boat bumps the dock. paul stands up with an oar,
pulling in; joe gets out and ropes the boat and takes several steps towards the land.
he calls my name, then pauses, â€œare you here?â€ echo: here, here?
he must have been waiting in the village, the searchers must have told him theyâ€™d
seen me, perhaps he was with them. he stayed behind when david and anna went
away in their car, or he drove to the city with them and then hitched back, walked
back, whatâ€™s important is that heâ€™s here, a mediator, an ambassador, offering me
something: captivity in any of its forms, a new freedom?
i watch him, my love for him useless as a third eye or a possibility. if i go with
him we will have to talk, wooden houses are obsolete, we can no longer live in
spurious peace by avoiding each other, the way it was before, we will have to begin.
for us itâ€™s
