Nina Mikhailovna Zarechnaya  - 
      Nina is a nineteen-year-old neighbor of Sorin's estate who grew up in an estate bordering the same lake that acts as a backdrop for the play. She is one of the four protagonists of the play. Nina's mother died when she was young and left her fortune to her husband, Nina's father, without leaving any inheritance for Nina. Her father remarried and put all of the money in her stepmother's name, contributing to Nina's insecure future. The play characters talk about how cruel Nina's father is to her and how Nina can only be in the company of Sorin's family when her father and stepmother do not know she is in their company. Nina is in love with Treplev or perhaps in love with the idea that Treplev can bring her close to his mother, an actress, which is what Nina wants to become. Naive, smart, idealistic, and willing to take risks, Nina is a hopeless romantic who longs for a stage career. Her pursuit of Trigorin's heart reveals her overestimated innocence by those around her and her ambitious side.
