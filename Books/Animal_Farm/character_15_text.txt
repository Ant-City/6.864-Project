sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in the big barn to
receive their orders for the week. the skull of old major, now clean of
flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the
foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun. after the hoisting of the flag, the
animals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner before
entering the barn. nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done
in the past. napoleon, with squealer and another pig named minimus, who
had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the front of
the raised platform, with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle round
them, and the other pigs sitting behind. the rest of the animals sat
facing them in the main body of the barn. napoleon read out the orders for
the week in a gruff soldierly style, and after a single singing of 'beasts
of england', all the animals dispersed.

on the third sunday after snowball's expulsion, the animals were somewhat

england' we expressed our longing for a better society in days to come.
but that society has now been established. clearly this song has no longer
any purpose."

frightened though they were, some of the animals might possibly have
protested, but at this moment the sheep set up their usual bleating of
"four legs good, two legs bad," which went on for several minutes and put
an end to the discussion.

so 'beasts of england' was heard no more. in its place minimus, the poet,
had composed another song which began:


animal farm, animal farm,
never through me shalt thou come to harm!


and this was sung every sunday morning after the hoisting of the flag.
but somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the animals to
come up to 'beasts of england'.

a few days later, when the terror caused by the executions had died down,
some of the animals remembered--or thought they remembered--that the sixth
commandment decreed "no animal s

usual to give napoleon the credit for every successful achievement and
every stroke of good fortune. you would often hear one hen remark to
another, "under the guidance of our leader, comrade napoleon, i have laid
five eggs in six days"; or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would
exclaim, "thanks to the leadership of comrade napoleon, how excellent this
water tastes!" the general feeling on the farm was well expressed in a
poem entitled comrade napoleon, which was composed by minimus and which
ran as follows:


friend of fatherless!
fountain of happiness!
lord of the swill-bucket! oh, how my soul is on
fire when i gaze at thy
calm and commanding eye,
like the sun in the sky,
comrade napoleon!

thou are the giver of
all that thy creatures love,
full belly twice a day, clean straw to roll upon;
every beast great or small
sleeps at peace in his stall,
thou watchest over all,
comrade napoleon!
