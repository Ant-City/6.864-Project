[CHARACTER] 
lily is a passionate artist, and, like mr. ramsay, she
worries over the fate of her work, fearing that her paintings will
be hung in attics or tossed absentmindedly under a couch. conventional
femininity, represented by mrs. ramsay in the form of marriage and
family, confounds lily, and she rejects it. the recurring memory
of charles tansley insisting that women can neither paint nor write
deepens her anxiety. it is with these self-doubts that she begins
her portrait of mrs. ramsay at the beginning of the novel, a portrait
riddled with problems that she is unable to solve. but lily undergoes
a drastic transformation over the course of the novel, evolving
from a woman who cannot make sense of the shapes and colors that
she tries to reproduce into an artist who achieves her vision and,
more important, overcomes the anxieties that have kept her from
it. by the end of the novel, lily, a serious and diligent worker,
puts into practice all that she has learned from mrs. ramsay. much
like the woman she so greatly admires, she is able to craft something
beautiful and lasting from the ephemeral materials around her--the
changing light, the view of the bay. her artistic achievement suggests
a larger sense of completeness in that she finally feels united
with mr. ramsay and the rational, intellectual sphere that he represents.
