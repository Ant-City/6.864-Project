[CHARACTER]  - 
      a shiftless, lower-class farmer who represents the ugly future of the white south. in other faulkner novels the snopes family represents a class of degraded poor whites who eventually rise in power and overwhelm old aristocrats like the sartorises. [CHARACTER] is no exception: he is lazy, greedy and cowardly and betrays granny millard twice, first to the yankees and then to the bandit grumby. though he comes across as good-natured at first, he is the novel's most unappealing character, and the fact that he escapes without punishment represents a breach in the moral order.
