d him, when he
stood alone like a star in the sky, out of this moment of a cold and
despair, siddhartha emerged, more a self than before, more firmly
concentrated.  he felt:  this had been the last tremor of the awakening,
the last struggle of this birth.  and it was not long until he walked
again in long strides, started to proceed swiftly and impatiently,
heading no longer for home, no longer to his father, no longer back.

kamala

siddhartha learned something new on every step of his path, for the
world was transformed, and his heart was enchanted.  he saw the sun
rising over the mountains with their forests and setting over the
distant beach with its palm-trees.  at night, he saw the stars in the
sky in their fixed positions and the crescent of the moon floating like
a boat in the blue.  he saw trees, stars, animals, clouds, rainbows,
rocks, herbs, flowers, stream and river, the glistening dew in the
bushes in the morn

tly felt drawn into the grove, but he thought about it, and
only now he became aware of how the servants and maids had looked at him
at the entrance, how despicable, how distrustful, how rejecting.

i am still a samana, he thought, i am still an ascetic and beggar.  i
must not remain like this, i will not be able to enter the grove like
this.  and he laughed.

the next person who came along this path he asked about the grove and
for the name of the woman, and was told that this was the grove of
kamala, the famous courtesan, and that, aside from the grove, she owned
a house in the city.

then, he entered the city.  now he had a goal.

pursuing his goal, he allowed the city to suck him in, drifted through
the flow of the streets, stood still on the squares, rested on the
stairs of stone by the river.  when the evening came, he made friends
with barber's assistant, whom he had seen working in the shade of an
arch in a building, whom he found again praying in a temple of vishnu,
whom he told abo

ut stories of vishnu and the lakshmi.  among the boats
by the river, he slept this night, and early in the morning, before the
first customers came into his shop, he had the barber's assistant shave
his beard and cut his hair, comb his hair and anoint it with fine oil.
then he went to take his bath in the river.

when late in the afternoon, beautiful kamala approached her grove in her
sedan-chair, siddhartha was standing at the entrance, made a bow and
received the courtesan's greeting.  but that servant who walked at the
very end of her train he motioned to him and asked him to inform his
mistress that a young brahman would wish to talk to her.  after a while,
the servant returned, asked him, who had been waiting, to follow him

one with her.

"weren't you already standing out there yesterday, greeting me?" asked
kamala.

"it's true that i've already seen and greeted you yesterday."

"but didn't you yesterday wear a beard, and long hair, and dust in your
hair?"

"you have observed well, you have seen everything.  you have seen
siddhartha, the son of a brahman, who has left his home to become a
samana, and who has been a samana for three years.  but now, i have
left that path and came into this city, and the first one i met, even
before i had entered the city, was you.  to say this, i have come to
you, oh kamal

a!  you are the first woman whom siddhartha is not
addressing with his eyes turned to the ground.  never again i want to
turn my eyes to the ground, when i'm coming across a beautiful woman."

kamala smiled and played with her fan of peacocks' feathers.  and asked:
"and only to tell me this, siddhartha has come to me?"

"to tell you this and to thank you for being so beautiful.  and if it
doesn't displease you, kamala, i would like to ask you to be my friend
and teacher, for i know nothing yet of that art which you have mastered
in the highest degree."

at this, kamala laughed aloud.

"never before this has happened to me, my friend, that a samana from the
forest came to me and wanted to learn from me!  never before this has
happened to me, that a samana came to me with long hair and an old, torn
loin-cloth!  many young men come to me, and there are also sons of
brahmans among them, but they come in beautifu

yesterday, i was already learning.  i have already taken off my beard,
have combed the hair, have oil in my hair.  there is little which is
still missing in me, oh excellent one: fine clothes, fine shoes, money
in my pouch.  you shall know, siddhartha has set harder goals for
himself than such trifles, and he has reached them.  how shouldn't i
reach that goal, which i have set for myself yesterday:  to be your
friend and to learn the joys of love from you!  you'll see that i'll
learn quickly, kamala, i have already learned harder things than what
you're supposed to teach me.  and now let's get to it: you aren't
satisfied with siddhartha as he is, with oil in his hair, but without
clothes, without shoes, without money?"

laughing, kamala exclaimed:  "no, my dear, he doesn't satisfy me yet.
clothes are what he must have, pretty clothes, and shoes, pretty shoes,
and lots of money in his pouch, and gifts for kamala.  do you know it
now, samana from the forest?  did you mark my words?"

"yes, i

 have marked your words," siddhartha exclaimed.  "how should i
not mark words which are coming from such a mouth!  your mouth is like
a freshly cracked fig, kamala.  my mouth is red and fresh as well, it
will be a suitable match for yours, you'll see.--but tell me, beautiful
kamala, aren't you at all afraid of the samana from the forest, who has
come to learn how to make love?"

"whatever for should i be afraid of a samana, a stupid samana from the
forest, who is coming from the jackals and doesn't even know yet what
women are?"

"oh, he's strong, the samana, and he isn't afraid of anything.  he could
force you, beautiful girl.  he could kidnap you.  he could hurt you."

"no, samana, i am not afraid of this.  did any samana or brahman ever
fear, someone might come and gra

like this it is also with kamala and with the pleasures of love.
beautiful and red is kamala's mouth, but just try to kiss it against
kamala's will, and you will not obtain a single drop of sweetness from
it, which knows how to give so many sweet things!  you are learning
easily, siddhartha, thus you should also learn this: love can be
obtained by begging, buying, receiving it as a gift, finding it in the
street, but it cannot be stolen.  in this, you have come up with the
wrong path.  no, it would be a pity, if a pretty young man like you
would want to tackle it in such a wrong manner."

siddhartha bowed with a smile.  "it would be

 a pity, kamala, you are so
right!  it would be such a great pity.  no, i shall not lose a single
drop of sweetness from your mouth, nor you from mine!  so it is settled:
siddhartha will return, once he'll have what he still lacks:
clothes, shoes, money.  but speak, lovely kamala, couldn't you still
give me one small advice?"

"an advice?  why not?  who wouldn't like to give an advice to a poor,
ignorant samana, who is coming from the jackals of the forest?"

"dear kamala, thus advise me where i should go to, that i'll find these
three things most quickly?"

"friend, many would like to know this.  you must do what you've learned
and ask for money, clothes, and shoes in return.  there is no other way
for a poor man to obtain money.  what might you be able to do?"

"i can think.  i can wait.  i can fast."

"nothing else?"

"nothing.  but yes, i can also write poetry.  would you like to give me
a kiss for a poem?"

"i would like to, if i'll like your poem.  what wo

siddhartha spoke, after he had thought about it for a moment, these
verses:

deeply, seeing the lotus's blossom,
bowed that man, and smiling kamala thanked.
more lovely, thought the young man, than offerings for gods,
more lovely is offering to pretty kamala.

kamala loudly clapped her hands, so that the golden bracelets clanged.

"beautiful are your verses, oh brown samana, and truly, i'm losing
nothing when i'm giving you a kiss for them."

she beckoned him with her eyes, he tilted his head so that his face
touched hers and placed his mouth on that mouth which was like a
freshly cracked fig.  for a long time, kamala kissed him, and with a
deep astonishment siddhartha felt how she taught him, how wise she was,
how she controlled him, rejected him, lured hi

m, and how after this first
one there was to be a long, a well ordered, well tested sequence of
kisses, everyone different from the others, he was still to receive.
breathing deeply, he remained standing where he was, and was in this
moment astonished like a child about the cornucopia of knowledge and
things worth learning, which revealed itself before his eyes.

"very beautiful are your verses," exclaimed kamala, "if i was rich, i
would give you pieces of gold for them.  but it will be difficult for
you to earn thus much money with verses as you need.  for you need a lot
of money, if you want to be kamala's friend."

"the way you're able to kiss, kamala!" stammered siddhartha.

"yes, this i am able to do, therefore i do not lack clothes, shoes,
bracelets, and all beautiful things.  but what will become of you?
aren't you able to do anything else but thinking, fasting, making
poetry?"

"i also know the

sacrificial songs," said siddhartha, "but i do not want
to sing them any more.  i also know magic spells, but i do not want to
speak them any more.  i have read the scriptures--"

"stop," kamala interrupted him.  "you're able to read?  and write?"

"certainly, i can do this.  many people can do this."

"most people can't.  i also can't do it.  it is very good that you're
able to read and write, very good.  you will also still find use for
the magic spells."

in this moment, a maid came running in and whispered a message into
her mistress's ear.

"there's a visitor for me," exclaimed kamala.  "hurry and get yourself
away, siddhartha, nobody may see you in here, remember this!  tomorrow,

he thought, i will ask no one for food any more.

suddenly, pride flared up in him.  he was no samana any more, it was no
longer becoming to him to beg.  he gave the rice-cake to a dog and
remained without food.

"simple is the life which people lead in this world here," thought
siddhartha.  "it presents no difficulties.  everything was difficult,
toilsome, and ultimately hopeless, when i was still a samana.  now,
everything is easy, easy like that lessons in kissing, which kamala is
giving me.  i need clothes and money, nothing else; this a small, near
goals, they won't make a person lose any sleep."

he had already discovered kamala's house in the city long before, there
he turned up the following day.

"things are working out well," she called out to him.  "they are
expecting you at kamaswami's, he is the richest merchant of the city.
if he'll like you, he'll accept you into his service.  be smart, brown
samana.  i had others tell him about you.  be polite towards him

 if he'll like
you, he'll entrust you with a lot."

siddhartha thanked her and laughed, and when she found out that he had
not eaten anything yesterday and today, she sent for bread and fruits
and treated him to it.

"you've been lucky," she said when they parted, "i'm opening one door
after another for you.  how come?  do you have a spell?"

siddhartha said:  "yesterday, i told you i knew how to think, to wait,
and to fast, but you thought this was of no use.  but it is useful for
many things, kamala, you'll see.  you'll see that the stupid samanas are
learning and able to do many pretty things in the forest, which the
likes of you aren't capable of.  the day before yesterday, i was still a
shaggy beggar, as soon as yesterday i have kissed kamala, and soon i'll
be a merchant and have money and all those things you insist upon."

"well yes," she admitted.  "but where would you be without me?  what
would you be, if kamala wasn't helping you?"

"dear kamala," said siddhartha and straightened u

p to his full height,
"when i came to you into your grove, i did the first step.  it was my
resolution to learn love from this most beautiful woman.  from that
moment on when i had made this resolution, i also knew that i would
carry it out.  i knew that you would help me, at your first glance at
the entrance of the grove i already knew it."

"but what if i hadn't been willing?"

"you were willing.  look, kamala:  when you throw a rock into the water,
it will speed on the fastest course to the bottom of the water.  this
is how it is when siddhartha has a goal, a resolution.  siddhartha does
nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things
of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without
stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall.  his goal attracts him,
because he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the
goal.  this is what siddhartha ha

s learned among the samanas.  this is
what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by
means of the daemons.  nothing is effected by daemons, there are no
daemons.  everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, if
he is able to think, if he is able to wait, if he is able to fast."

kamala listened to him.  she loved his voice, she loved the look from
his eyes.

"perhaps it is so," she said quietly, "as you say, friend.  but perhaps
it is also like this: that siddhartha is a handsome man, that his glance
pleases the women, that therefore good fortune is coming towards him."

with one kiss, siddhartha bid his farewell.  "i wish that it should be
this way, my teacher; that my glance shall please you, that always
good fortune shall come to me out of your direction!"

 house."

siddhartha thanked and accepted, and lived in the dealers house from now
on.  clothes were brought to him, and shoes, and every day, a servant
prepared a bath for him.  twice a day, a plentiful meal was served, but
siddhartha only ate once a day, and ate neither meat nor did he drink
wine.  kamaswami told him about his trade, showed him the merchandise
and storage-rooms, showed him calculations.  siddhartha got to know
many new things, he heard a lot and spoke little.  and thinking of
kamala's words, he was never subservient to the merchant, forced him
to treat him as an equal, yes even more than an equal.  kamaswami
conducted his business with care and often with passion, but siddhartha
looked upon all of this as if it was a game, the rules of which he
tried hard to learn precisely, but the contents of which did not touch
his heart.

he was not in kamaswami's house for long, when he already took part in
his landlords business.  but daily, at the hour appointed by her, he
visited b

regarding love, still a boy and had a tendency to plunge blindly and
insatiably into lust like into a bottomless pit, him she taught,
thoroughly starting with the basics, about that school of thought which
teaches that pleasure cannot be taken without giving pleasure, and
that every gesture, every caress, every touc

cret, which would bring
happiness to those who know about it and unleash it.  she taught him,
that lovers must not part from one another after celebrating love,
without one admiring the other, without being just as defeated as they
have been victorious, so that with none of them should start feeling
fed up or bored and get that evil feeling of having abused or having
been abused.  wonderful hours he spent with the beautiful and smart
artist, became her student, her lover, her friend.  here with kamala
was the worth and purpose of his present life, nit with the business
of kamaswami.

the merchant passed to duties of writing important letters and contracts
on to him and got into the habit of discussing all important affairs
with him.  he soon saw that siddhartha knew little about rice and wool,
shipping and trade, but that he acted in a fortunate manner, and that
siddhartha surpassed him, the merchant, in calmness and equanimity, and
in the art of listening and deeply understanding previously

maswami held against
him that he had learned everything he knew from him, he replied:  "would
you please not kid me with such jokes!  what i've learned from you is
how much a basket of fish costs and how much interests may be charged on
loaned money.  these are your areas of expertise.  i haven't learned to
think from you, my dear kamaswami, you ought to be the one seeking to
learn from me."

indeed his soul was not with the trade.  the business was good enough
to provide him with the money for kamala, and it earned him much more
than he needed.  besides from this, siddhartha's interest and curiosity
was only concerned with the people, whose businesses, crafts, worries,
pleasures, and acts of foolishness used to be as alien and distant to
him as the moon.  however easily he succeeded in talking to all of them,
in living with all of them, in learning from all of them, he was still
aware that there was something which separated him from them and this
separating factor was him being a samana.

the source ran somewhere, far away from him, ran and
ran invisibly, had nothing to do with his life any more.  and at several
times he suddenly became scared on account of such thoughts and wished
that he would also be gifted with the ability to participate in all of
this childlike-naive occupations of the daytime with passion and with
his heart, really to live, really to act, really to enjoy and to live
instead of just standing by as a spectator.  but again and again, he
came back to beautiful kamala, learned the art of love, practised the
cult of lust, in which more than in anything else giving and taking
becomes one, chatted with her, learned from her, gave her advice,
received advice.  she understood him better than govinda used to
understand him, she was more similar to him.

once, he said to her:  "you are like me, you are different from most
people.  you are kamala, nothing else, and inside of you, there is a
peace and refuge, to which you can go at every hour of the day and be
at hom

e at yourself, as i can also do.  few people have this, and yet
all could have it."

"not all people are smart," said kamala.

"no," said siddhartha, "that's not the reason why.  kamaswami is just as
smart as i, and still has no refuge in himself.  others have it, who are
small children with respect to their mind.  most people, kamala, are
like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the
air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground.  but others, a few, are
like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in
themselves they have their law and their course.  among all the learned
men and samanas, of which i knew many, there was one of this kind, a
perfected one, i'll never be able to forget him.  it is that gotama,
the exalted one, who is spreading that teachings.  thousands of
followers are list

ening to his teachings every day, follow his
instructions every hour, but they are all falling leaves, not in
themselves they have teachings and a law."

kamala looked at him with a smile.  "again, you're talking about him,"
she said, "again, you're having a samana's thoughts."

siddhartha said nothing, and they played the game of love, one of the
thirty or forty different games kamala knew.  her body was flexible
like that of a jaguar and like the bow of a hunter; he who had learned
from her how to make love, was knowledgeable of many forms of lust, many
secrets.  for a long time, she played with siddhartha, enticed him,
rejected him, forced him, embraced him: enjoyed his masterful skills,
until he was defeated and rested exhausted by her side.

the courtesan bent over him, took a long look at his face, at his eyes,
which had grown tired.

"you are the best lover," she said

you also do not love--how else could you practise love as a craft?
perhaps, people of our kind can't love.  the childlike people can;
that's their secret."




sansara

for a long time, siddhartha had lived the life of the world and of lust,
though without being a part of it.  his senses, which he had killed off
in hot years as a samana, had awoken again, he had tasted riches, had
tasted lust, had tasted power; nevertheless he had still remained in his
heart for a long time a samana; kamala, being smart, had realized this
quite right.  it was still the art of thinking, of waiting, of fasting,
which guided his life; still the people of the world, the childlike
people, had remained alien to him as he was alien to them.

years passed by; surrounded by the good life, siddhartha hardly felt
them fading away.  he had become rich, for quite a while he possessed a
house of his own and his own servants, and a garden before the city by
the river.  the people liked him, they came to him, whe

that high, bright state of being awake, which he had experienced that
one time at the height of his youth, in those days after gotama's
sermon, after the separation from govinda, that tense expectation, that
proud state of standing alone without teachings and without teachers,
that supple willingness to listen to the divine voice in his own heart,
had slowly become a memory, had been fleeting; distant and quiet, the
holy source murmured, which used to be near, which used to murmur within
hims

, whenever he found his face in the mirror at the bedroom's wall to
have aged and become more ugly, whenever embarrassment and disgust came
over him, he continued fleeing, fleeing into a new game, fleeing into a
numbing of his mind brought on by sex, by wine, and from there he fled
back into the urge to pile up and obtain possessions.  in this pointless
cycle he ran, growing tired, growing old, growing ill.

then the time came when a dream warned him.  he had spend the hours of
the evening with kamala, in her beautiful pleasure-garden.  they had
been sitting under the trees, talking, and kamala had said thoughtful
words, words behind which a sadness and tiredness lay hidden.  she had
asked him to tell her about gotama, and could not hear enough of him,
how clear his eyes, how still and beautiful his mouth, how kind his
smile, how peaceful his walk had been.  for a long time, he had to tell
her about the exalted buddha, and kamala had sighed and had said:  "one
day, perhaps soon, i'll also fo

llow that buddha.  i'll give him my
pleasure-garden for a gift and take my refuge in his teachings."  but
after this, she had aroused him, and had tied him to her in the act
of making love with painful fervour, biting and in tears, as if, once
more, she wanted to squeeze the last sweet drop out of this vain,
fleeting pleasure.  never before, it had become so strangely clear to
siddhartha, how closely lust was akin to death.  then he had lain by
her side, and kamala's face had been close to him, and under her eyes
and next to the corners of her mouth he had, as clearly as never before,
read a fearful inscription, an inscription of small lines, of slight
grooves, an inscription reminiscent of autumn and old age, just as
siddhartha himself, who was only in his forties, had already noticed,
here and there, gray hairs among his black ones.  tiredness was written
on kamala's beautiful face, tiredness from walking a long path, which
has no happy destination, tir

much, vomits it back up again with agonising pain and is
nevertheless glad about the relief, thus this sleepless man wished to
free himself of these pleasures, these habits and all of this pointless
life and himself, in an immense burst of disgust.  not until the light
of the morning and the beginning of the first activities in the street
before his city-house, he had slightly fallen asleep, had found for a
few moments a half unconsciousness, a hint of sleep.  in those moments,
he had a dream:

kamala owned a small, rare singing bird in a golden cage.  of this bird,
he dreamt.  he dreamt: this bird had become mute, who at other times
always used to sing in the morning, and since this arose his attention,
he stepped in front of the cage and looked inside; there the small bird
was dead and lay stiff on the ground.  he took it out, weighed it for a
moment in his hand, and then threw it away, out in the street, and in
the same moment, he felt terribly shocked, and his heart hurt, as if he
had th

goal, without thirst, without elevation, content with small lustful
pleasures and yet never satisfied!  for all of these many years, without
knowing it himself, he had tried hard and longed to become a man like
those many, like those children, and in all this, his life had been
much more miserable and poorer than theirs, and their goals were not
his, nor their worries; after all, that entire world of the
kamaswami-people had only been a game to him, a dance he would watch, a
comedy.  only kamala had been dear, had been valuable to him--but was
she still thus?  did he still need her, or she him?  did they not play
a game without an ending?  was it necessary to live for this?  no, it
was not necessary!  the name of this game was sansara, a game for
children, a game which was perhaps enjoyable to play once, twice, ten
times--but for ever and ever over again?

then, siddhartha knew that the game was over, that he could not play it
any more.  shivers ran over his body, inside of him, so he

ell to the mango-tree, his farewell to the pleasure-garden.  since
he had been without food this day, he felt strong hunger, and thought
of his house in the city, of his chamber and bed, of the table with the
meals on it.  he smiled tiredly, shook himself, and bid his farewell to
these things.

in the same hour of the night, siddhartha left his garden, left the
city, and never came back.  for a long time, kamaswami had people look
for him, thinking that he had fallen into the hands of robbers.  kamala
had no one look for him.  when she was told that siddhartha had
disappeared, she was not astonished.  did she not always expect it?  was
he not a samana, a man who was at home nowhere, a pilgrim?  and most of
all, she had felt this the last time they had been together, and she was
happy, in spite of all the pain of the loss, that she had pulled him so
affectionately to her heart for this last time, that she had felt one
more time to be so completely possessed and penetrated by him.

his very thing, so it seemed to him now, which had
been his sickness before, that he was not able to love anybody or
anything.

with a smiling face, siddhartha watched the leaving monk.  the sleep had
strengthened him much, but hunger gave him much pain, for by now he had
not eaten for two days, and the times were long past when he had been
tough against hunger.  with sadness, and yet also with a smile, he
thought of that time.  in those days, so he remembered, he had boasted
of three things to kamala, had been able to do three noble and
undefeatable feats: fasting--waiting--thinking.  these had been his
possession, his power and strength, his solid staff; in the busy,
laborious years of his youth, he had learned these three feats, nothing
else.  and now, they had abandoned him, none of them was his any more,
neither fasting, nor waiting, nor thinking.  for the most wretched
things, he had given them up, for what fades most quickly, for sensual
lust, for the good life, for riches!  his life

still unable to accept his teachings.  no, there was no teaching a
truly searching person, someone who truly wanted to find, could accept.
but he who had found, he could approve of any teachings, every path,
every goal, there was nothing standing between him and all the other
thousand any more who lived in that what is eternal, who breathed what
is divine.

on one of these days, when so many went on a pilgrimage to the dying
buddha, kamala also went to him, who used to be the most beautiful of
the courtesans.  a long time ago, she had retired from her previous
life, had given her garden to the monks of gotama as a gift, had taken
her refuge in the teachings, was among the friends and benefactors of
the pilgrims.  together with siddhartha the boy, her son, she had gone
on her way due to the news of the near death of gotama, in simple
clothes, on foot.  with her little son, she was travelling by the river;
but the boy had soon grow

n tired, desired to go back home, desired to
rest, desired to eat, became disobedient and started whining.

kamala often had to take a rest with him, he was accustomed to having
his way against her, she had to feed him, had to comfort him, had to
scold him.  he did not comprehend why he had to go on this exhausting
and sad pilgrimage with his mother, to an unknown place, to a stranger,
who was holy and about to die.  so what if he died, how did this concern
the boy?

the pilgrims were getting close to vasudeva's ferry, when little
siddhartha once again forced his mother to rest.  she, kamala herself,
had al

so become tired, and while the boy was chewing a banana, she
crouched down on the ground, closed her eyes a bit, and rested.  but
suddenly, she uttered a wailing scream, the boy looked at her in fear
and saw her face having grown pale from horror; and from under her
dress, a small, black snake fled, by which kamala had been bitten.

hurriedly, they now both ran along the path, in order to reach people,
and got near to the ferry, there kamala collapsed, and was not able to
go any further.  but the boy started crying miserably, only interrupting
it to kiss and hug his mother, and she also joined his loud screams for
help, until the sound reached vasudeva's ears, who stood at the ferry.
quickly, he came walking, took the woman on his arms, carried her into
the boat, the boy ran along, and soon they all reached the hut, were
siddhartha stood by the stove and was just lighting the fire.  he looked
up and first saw the boy's face, which

wondrously reminded him of
something, like a warning to remember something he had forgotten.  then
he saw kamala, whom he instantly recognised, though she lay unconscious
in the ferryman's arms, and now he knew that it was his own son, whose
face had been such a warning reminder to him, and the heart stirred in
his chest.

kamala's wound was washed, but had already turned black and her body was
swollen, she was made to drink a healing potion.  her consciousness
returned, she lay on siddhartha's bed in the hut and bent over her stood
siddhartha, who used to love her so much.  it seemed like a dream to
her; with a smile, she looked at her friend's face; just slowly she,
realized her situation, remembered the bite, called timidly for the boy.

"he's with you, don't worry," said siddhartha.

kamala looked into his eyes.  sh

e spoke with a heavy tongue, paralysed
by the poison.  "you've become old, my dear," she said, "you've become
gray.  but you are like the young samana, who at one time came without
clothes, with dusty feet, to me into the garden.  you are much more like
him, than you were like him at that time when you had left me and
kamaswami.  in the eyes, you're like him, siddhartha.  alas, i have also
grown old, old--could you still recognise me?"

siddhartha smiled:  "instantly, i recognised you, kamala, my dear."

kamala pointed to her boy and said:  "did you recognise him as well?
he is your son."

her eyes became confused and fell shut.  the boy wept, siddhartha took
him on his knees, let him weep, petted his hair, and at the sight of
the child's face, a brahman prayer came to his mind, which he had
learned a long time ago, when he had been a little boy himself.  slowly,
with a singing voice, he started to speak; from his past and childhood,
the words came flowing to him.  and with that sin

gsong, the boy became
calm, was only now and then uttering a sob and fell asleep.  siddhartha
placed him on vasudeva's bed.  vasudeva stood by the stove and cooked
rice.  siddhartha gave him a look, which he returned with a smile.

"she'll die," siddhartha said quietly.

vasudeva nodded; over his friendly face ran the light of the stove's
fire.

once again, kamala returned to consciousness.  pain distorted her face,
siddhartha's eyes read the suffering on her mouth, on her pale cheeks.
quietly, he read it, attentively, waiting, his mind becoming one with
her suffering.  kamala felt it, her gaze sought his eyes.

looking at him, she said:  "now i see that your eyes have changed as
well.  they've become completely different.  by what do i still
recognise that you're siddhartha?  it's you, and it's not you."

siddhartha said nothing, quietly his eyes looked

 at hers.

"you have achieved it?" she asked.  "you have found peace?"

he smiled and placed his hand on hers.

"i'm seeing it," she said, "i'm seeing it.  i too will find peace."

"you have found it," siddhartha spoke in a whisper.

kamala never stopped looking into his eyes.  she thought about her
pilgrimage to gotama, which wanted to take, in order to see the face of
the perfected one, to breathe his peace, and she thought that she had
now found him in his place, and that it was good, just as good, as if
she had seen the other one.  she wanted to tell this to him, but the
tongue no longer obeyed her will.  without speaking, she looked at him,
and he saw the life fading from her eyes.  when the final pain filled
her eyes and mad

vasudeva.  i sat here, i was listening to the river.  a lot it has
told me, deeply it has filled me with the healing thought, with the
thought of oneness."

"you've experienced suffering, siddhartha, but i see: no sadness has
entered your heart."

"no, my dear, how should i be sad?  i, who have been rich and happy,
have become even richer and happier now.  my son has been given to me."

"your son shall be welcome to me as well.  but now, siddhartha, let's
get to work, there is much to be done.  kamala has died on the same bed,
on which my wife had died a long time ago.  let us also build kamala's
funeral pile on the same hill on which i had then built my wife's
funeral pile."

while the boy was still asleep, they built the funeral pile.




the son

timid and weeping, the boy had attended his mother's funeral; gloomy
and shy, he had listened to siddhartha, who greeted him as his son and
welcomed him at his place in vasudeva's hut.  pale, he sat for many
days by the hill of the dead, did not

y person thus, thus blindly, thus
sufferingly, thus unsuccessfully, and yet thus happily?

siddhartha could not heed his friend's advice, he could not give up the
boy.  he let the boy give him orders, he let him disregard him.  he
said nothing and waited; daily, he began the mute struggle of
friendliness, the silent war of patience.  vasudeva also said nothing
and waited, friendly, knowing, patient.  they were both masters of
patience.

at one time, when the boy's face reminded him very much of kamala,
siddhartha suddenly had to think of a line which kamala a long time
ago, in the days of their youth, had once said to him.  "you cannot
love," she had said to him, and he had agreed with her and had compared
himself with a star, while comparing the childlike people with falling
leaves, and nevertheless he had also sensed an accusation in that line.
indeed, he had never been able to lose or devote himself completely to
another person, to forget himself, to commit foolish acts for the love
of an

e pursuer.  as he continued thinking, he also found that he, on his
part, was not worried for his son, that he knew deep inside that he had
neither perished nor was in any danger in the forest.  nevertheless, he
ran without stopping, no longer to save him, just to satisfy his desire,
just to perhaps see him one more time.  and he ran up to just outside of
the city.

when, near the city, he reached a wide road, he stopped, by the entrance
of the beautiful pleasure-garden, which used to belong to kamala, where
he had seen her for the first time in her sedan-chair.  the past rose
up in his soul, again he saw himself standing there, young, a bearded,
naked samana, the hair full of dust.  for a long time, siddhartha stood
there and looked through the open gate into the garden, seeing monks in
yellow robes walking among the beautiful trees.

for a long time, he stood there, pondering, seeing images, listening to
the story of his life.  for a long time, he stood there, looked at the
monks, saw youn

g siddhartha in their place, saw young kamala walking
among the high trees.  clearly, he saw himself being served food and
drink by kamala, receiving his first kiss from her, looking proudly and
disdainfully back on his brahmanism, beginning proudly and full of
desire his worldly life.  he saw kamaswami, saw the servants, the
orgies, the gamblers with the dice, the musicians, saw kamala's
song-bird in the cage, lived through all this once again, breathed
sansara, was once again old and tired, felt once again disgust, felt
once again the wish to annihilate himself, was once again healed by the
holy om.

after having been standing by the gate of the garden for a long time,
siddhartha realised that his desire was foolish, which had made him go
up to this place, that he could not help his son, that he was not
allowed to cling him.  deeply, he felt the love for the run-away in his

the boy,
greedily rushing along the burning course of his young wishes, each
one heading for his goal, each one obsessed by the goal, each one
suffering.  the river sang with a voice of suffering, longingly it sang,
longingly, it flowed towards its goal, lamentingly its voice sang.

"do you hear?" vasudeva's mute gaze asked.  siddhartha nodded.

"listen better!" vasudeva whispered.

siddhartha made an effort to listen better.  the image of his father,
his own image, the image of his son merged, kamala's image also appeared
and was dispersed, and the image of govinda, and other images, and they
merged with each other, turned all into the river, headed all, being the
river, for the goal, longing, desiring, suffering, and the river's voice
sounded full of yearning, full of burning woe, full of unsatisfiable
desire.  for the goal, the river was heading, siddhartha saw it
hurrying, the river, which consisted of him and his loved ones and of
all people, he had ever seen, all of these waves and wat

wn it," he said quietly.  "you'll go into the forests?"

"i'm going into the forests, i'm going into the oneness," spoke vasudeva
with a bright smile.

with a bright smile, he left; siddhartha watched him leaving.  with deep
joy, with deep solemnity he watched him leave, saw his steps full of
peace, saw his head full of lustre, saw his body full of light.




govinda

together with other monks, govinda used to spend the time of rest
between pilgrimages in the pleasure-grove, which the courtesan kamala
had given to the followers of gotama for a gift.  he heard talk of an
old ferryman, who lived one day's journey away by the river, and
who was regarded as a wise man by many.  when govinda went back on his
way, he chose the path to the ferry, eager to see the ferryman.
because, though he had lived his entire life by the rules, though he was
also looked upon with veneration by the younger monks on account of his
age and his modesty, the restlessness and the searching still had not
perished from
