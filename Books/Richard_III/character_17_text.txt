s boy! go to, you are too
    shrewd.
  archbishop. good madam, be not angry with the child.
  queen elizabeth. pitchers have ears.

                        enter a messenger

  archbishop. here comes a messenger. what news?

    are sent to pomfret, and with them
    sir thomas vaughan, prisoners.
  duchess. who hath committed them?
  messenger. the mighty dukes, gloucester and buckingham.
  archbishop. for what offence?

  queen elizabeth. ay me, i see the ruin of my house!

    insulting tyranny begins to jet
    upon the innocent and aweless throne.

h.
  catesby. god keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
  hastings. but i shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,
    that they which brought me in my master's hate,
    i live to look upon their tragedy.
    well, catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,
    i'll send some packing that yet think not on't.
  catesby. 'tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
    when men are unprepar'd and look not for it.
  hastings. o monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
    with rivers, vaughan, grey; and so 'twill do
    with some men else that think themselves as safe
    as thou and i, who, as thou knowest, are dear
    to princely richard and to buckingham.
  catesby. the princes both make high account of you-
    [aside]  for they account his head upon the bridge.
  hastings. i know they do, and i have well deserv'd it.

                      enter lord stanley

    come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
    fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?

    knowest it not.-
    come, will you go?

  rivers. sir richard ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
    to-day shalt thou behold a subject die
    for truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

h not in my woes!
    god witness with me, i have wept for thine.
  queen margaret. bear with me; i am hungry for revenge,
    and now i cloy me with beholding it.
    thy edward he is dead, that kill'd my edward;
    the other edward dead, to quit my edward;
    young york he is but boot, because both they
    match'd not the high perfection of my loss.
    thy clarence he is dead that stabb'd my edward;
    and the beholders of this frantic play,
    th' adulterate hastings, rivers, vaughan, grey,
    untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
    richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer;
    only reserv'd their factor to buy souls
    and send them thither. but at hand, at hand,
    ensues his piteous and unpitied end.
    earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
    to have him suddenly convey'd from hence.
    cancel his bond of life, dear god, i pray,
    that i may live and say 'the dog is dead.'
