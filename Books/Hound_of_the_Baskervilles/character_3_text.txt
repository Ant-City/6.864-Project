“early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”

“how can you say that, sir?”

“you have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time
that you have been talking. it would be a poor expert who could not give
the date of a document within a decade or so. you may possibly have read
my little monograph upon the subject. i put that at 1730.”

“the exact date is 1742.” dr. mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.
“this family paper was committed to my care by sir charles baskerville,
whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much
excitement in devonshire. i may say that i was his personal friend as
well as his medical attendant. he was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,
practical, and as unimaginative as i am myself. yet he took this
document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end
as did eventually overtake him.”

holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon
his knee. “you will observe, watson, the a

his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at mr. sherlock
holmes. the latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the
fire.

“well?” said he.

“do you not find it interesting?”

“to a collector of fairy tales.”

dr. mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.

“now, mr. holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. this
is the devon county chronicle of may 14th of this year. it is a short
account of the facts elicited at the death of sir charles baskerville
which occurred a few days before that date.”

my friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. our
visitor readjusted his glasses and began:

        “the recent sudden death of sir charles baskerville, whose
        name has been mentioned as the probable liberal candidate
        for mid-devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over
        the county.  though sir charles had resided at baskerville
        hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of

        their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends,
        tends to show that sir charles’s health has for some time
        been impaired, and points especially to some affection
        of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,
        breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.
        dr. james mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of
        the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.

        “the facts of the case are simple.  sir charles baskerville
        was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking
        down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall.  the evidence
        of the barrymores shows that this had been his custom.
        on the fourth of may sir charles had declared his intention
        of starting next day for london, and had ordered barrymore
        to prepare his luggage.  that night he went out as usual
        for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in

        hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly
        interrupted.  had the prosaic finding of the coroner not
        finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been
        whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been
        difficult to find a tenant for baskerville hall.  it is
        understood that the next of kin is mr. henry baskerville,
        if he be still alive, the son of sir charles baskerville’s
        younger brother.  the young man when last heard of was
        in america, and inquiries are being instituted with a
        view to informing him of his good fortune.”

dr. mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. “those
are the public facts, mr. holmes, in connection with the death of sir
charles baskerville.”

“i must thank you,” said sherlock holmes, “for calling my attention to a
case which certainly presents some features of interest. i had observ

baskerville hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted
if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation.
for both these reasons i thought that i was justified in telling rather
less than i knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with
you there is no reason why i should not be perfectly frank.

“the moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other
are thrown very much together. for this reason i saw a good deal of
sir charles baskerville. with the exception of mr. frankland, of lafter
hall, and mr. stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of
education within many miles. sir charles was a retiring man, but the
chance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests
in science kept us so. he had brought back much scientific information
from south africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together
discussing the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the hottentot.

ary which forms the last chapter has
brought my narrative up to the eighteenth of october, a time when these
strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion.
the incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my
recollection, and i can tell them without reference to the notes made
at the time. i start them from the day which succeeded that upon which
i had established two facts of great importance, the one that mrs. laura
lyons of coombe tracey had written to sir charles baskerville and made
an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his
death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found
among the stone huts upon the hillside. with these two facts in my
possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be
deficient if i could not throw some further light upon these dark
places.

i had no opportunity to tell the baronet what i had learned about mrs.
lyons upon the evening before, for dr. mortimer remained with him at

 for my visit. i had not quite understood until that instant how
delicate my mission was.

“i have the pleasure,” said i, “of knowing your father.”

it was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it. “there
is nothing in common between my father and me,” she said. “i owe him
nothing, and his friends are not mine. if it were not for the late sir
charles baskerville and some other kind hearts i might have starved for
all that my father cared.”

“it was about the late sir charles baskerville that i have come here to
see you.”

the freckles started out on the lady’s face.

“what can i tell you about him?” she asked, and her fingers played
nervously over the stops of her typewriter.

“you knew him, did you not?”

“i have already said that i owe a great deal to his kindness. if i am
able to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took
in my unhappy situation.”

“did you correspond with him?”

the lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her h

o do good by stealth.”

“but if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know
enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has
done?”

she met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.

“there were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to
help me. one was mr. stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of sir
charles’s. he was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that sir
charles learned about my affairs.”

i knew already that sir charles baskerville had made stapleton his
almoner upon several occasions, so the lady’s statement bore the impress
of truth upon it.

“did you ever write to sir charles asking him to meet you?” i continued.

mrs. lyons flushed with anger again. “really, sir, this is a very
extraordinary question.”

“i am sorry, madam, but i must repeat it.”

“then i answer, certainly not.”

“not on the very day of sir charles’s death?”

the flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me. h

hile we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to
be needed. that telegram from london, if mentioned by sir henry to the
stapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. already i
seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.

mrs. laura lyons was in her office, and sherlock holmes opened his
interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.

“i am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the
late sir charles baskerville,” said he. “my friend here, dr. watson,
has informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have
withheld in connection with that matter.”

“what have i withheld?” she asked defiantly.

“you have confessed that you asked sir charles to be at the gate at ten
o’clock. we know that that was the place and hour of his death. you have
withheld what the connection is between these events.”

“there is no connection.”

“in that case the coincidence must indeed be an

hief from the first is evident from the way in which
he took his wife with him in the character of his sister. the idea of
using her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not
have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. he
meant in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool
or run any risk for that end. his first act was to establish himself as
near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second was to cultivate
a friendship with sir charles baskerville and with the neighbours.

“the baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared
the way for his own death. stapleton, as i will continue to call him,
knew that the old man’s heart was weak and that a shock would kill him.

but the man’s was visible. on seeing him lying still the creature had
probably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had turned
away again. it was then that it left the print which was actually
observed by dr. mortimer. the hound was called off and hurried away to
its lair in the grimpen mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled
the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case
within the scope of our observation.

“so much for the death of sir charles baskerville. you perceive the
devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make
a case against the real murderer. his only accomplice was one who could
never give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of
the device only served to make it more effective. both of the women
concerned in the case, mrs. stapleton and mrs. laura lyons, were left
with a strong suspicion against stapleton. mrs. stapleton knew that he
had designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the
