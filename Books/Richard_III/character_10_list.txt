Young Elizabeth - 
 The former Queen Elizabeth's daughter. Young Elizabeth
enjoys the fate of many Renaissance noblewomen. She becomes a pawn
in political power-brokering, and is promised in marriage at the
end of the play to Richmond, the Lancastrian rebel leader, in order
to unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster.
