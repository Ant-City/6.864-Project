ur explanation, and pray make it improbable.  [sits on sofa.]

jack.  my dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all.  in fact it’s perfectly ordinary.  old mr. thomas cardew, who adopted me when i was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, miss cecily cardew.  cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable governess, miss prism.

algernon.  where is that place in the country, by the way?

jack.  that is nothing to you, dear boy.  you are not going to be invited . . . i may tell you candidly that the place is not in shropshire.

algernon.  i suspected that, my dear fellow!  i have bunburyed all over shropshire on two separate occasions.  now, go on.  why are you ernest in town and jack in the country?

jack.  my dear algy, i don’t know whether you will be able to understand my real motives.  you are hardly serious en

garden at the manor house.  a flight of grey stone steps leads up to the house.  the garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses.  time of year, july.  basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a large yew-tree.

[miss prism discovered seated at the table.  cecily is at the back watering flowers.]

miss prism.  [calling.]  cecily, cecily!  surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather moulton’s duty than yours?  especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you.  your german grammar is on the table.  pray open it at page fifteen.  we will repeat yesterday’s lesson.

cecily.  [coming over very slowly.]  but i don’t like german.  it isn’t at all a becoming language.  i k

now perfectly well that i look quite plain after my german lesson.

miss prism.  child, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve yourself in every way.  he laid particular stress on your german, as he was leaving for town yesterday.  indeed, he always lays stress on your german when he is leaving for town.

cecily.  dear uncle jack is so very serious!  sometimes he is so serious that i think he cannot be quite well.

miss prism.  [drawing herself up.]  your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his gravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so comparatively young as he is.  i know no one who has a higher sense of duty and responsibility.

cecily.  i suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are together.

miss prism.  cecily!  i am surprised at you.  mr. worthing has many troubles in his life.  idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his conversation.  you must rem

ember his constant anxiety about that unfortunate young man his brother.

cecily.  i wish uncle jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother, to come down here sometimes.  we might have a good influence over him, miss prism.  i am sure you certainly would.  you know german, and geology, and things of that kind influence a man very much.  [cecily begins to write in her diary.]

miss prism.  [shaking her head.]  i do not think that even i could produce any effect on a character that according to his own brother’s admission is irretrievably weak and vacillating.  indeed i am not sure that i would desire to reclaim him.  i am not in favour of this modern mania for turning bad people into good people at a moment’s notice.  as a man sows so let him reap.  you must put away your diary, cecily.  i really don’t see why you should keep a diary at all.

cecily.  i keep a diary in or

miss prism.  memory, my dear cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.

cecily.  yes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and couldn’t possibly have happened.  i believe that memory is responsible for nearly all the three-volume novels that mudie sends us.

miss prism.  do not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, cecily.  i wrote one myself in earlier days.

cecily.  did you really, miss prism?  how wonderfully clever you are!  i hope it did not end happily?  i don’t like novels that end happily.  they depress me so much.

miss prism.  the good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.  that is what fiction means.

cecily.  i suppose so.  but it seems very unfair.  and was your novel ever published?

miss prism.  alas! no.  the manuscript unfortunately

cecily.  [smiling.]  but i see dear dr. chasuble coming up through the garden.

miss prism.  [rising and advancing.]  dr. chasuble!  this is indeed a pleasure.

[enter canon chasuble.]

chasuble.  and how are we this morning?  miss prism, you are, i trust, well?

cecily.  miss prism has just been complaining of a slight headache.  i think it would do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the park, dr. chasuble.

miss prism.  cecily, i have not mentioned anything about a headache.

cecily.  no, dear miss prism, i know that, but i felt instinctively that you had a headache.  indeed i was thinking about that, and not about my german lesson, when the rector came in.

chasuble.  i hope, cecily, you are not inattentive.

cecily.  oh, i am afraid i am.

miss prism.  we do not expect him till monday afternoon.

chasuble.  ah yes, he usually likes to spend his sunday in london.  he is not one of those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that unfortunate young man his brother seems to be.  but i must not disturb egeria and her pupil any longer.

miss prism.  egeria?  my name is lætitia, doctor.

chasuble.  with pleasure, miss prism, with pleasure.  we might go as far as the schools and back.

miss prism.  that would be delightful.  cecily, you will read your political economy in my absence.  the chapter on the fall of the rupee you may omit.  it is somewhat too sensational.  even these metallic problems have their melodramatic side.

merriman.  yes, miss.  he seemed very much disappointed.  i mentioned that you and miss prism were in the garden.  he said he was anxious to speak to you privately for a moment.

cecily.  ask mr. ernest worthing to come here.  i suppose you had better talk to the housekeeper about a room for him.

merriman.  yes, miss.

cecily.  i have never met any really wicked person before.  i feel rather frightened.  i am so afraid he will look just like every one else.

algernon.  no, i’d sooner have a pink rose.

cecily.  why?  [cuts a flower.]

algernon.  because you are like a pink rose, cousin cecily.

cecily.  i don’t think it can be right for you to talk to me like that.  miss prism never says such things to me.

algernon.  then miss prism is a short-sighted old lady.  [cecily puts the rose in his buttonhole.]  you are the prettiest girl i ever saw.

cecily.  miss prism says that all good looks are a snare.

algernon.  they are a snare that every sensible man would like to be caught in.

cecily.  oh, i don’t think i would care to catch a sensible man.  i shouldn’t know what to talk to him about.

chasuble.  [with a scholar’s shudder.]  believe me, i do not deserve so neologistic a phrase.  the precept as well as the practice of the primitive church was distinctly against matrimony.

miss prism.  [sententiously.]  that is obviously the reason why the primitive church has not lasted up to the present day.  and you do not seem to realise, dear doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation.  men should be more careful; this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.

chasuble.  but is a man not equally attractive when married?

miss prism.  no married man is ever attractive except to his wife.

chasuble.  perhaps she followed us to the schools.

chasuble.  mr. worthing?

miss prism.  this is indeed a surprise.  we did not look for you till monday afternoon.

miss prism.  what a lesson for him!  i trust he will profit by it.

chasuble.  mr. worthing, i offer you my sincere condolence.  you have at least the consolation of knowing that you were always the most generous and forgiving of brothers.

jack.  poor ernest!  he had many faults, but it is a sad, sad blow.

chasuble.  very sad indeed.  were you with him at the end?

jack.  no.  he died abroad; in paris, in fact.  i had a telegram last night from the manager of the grand hotel.

jack.  no.  he seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in paris.

chasuble.  in paris!  [shakes his head.]  i fear that hardly points to any very serious state of mind at the last.  you would no doubt wish me to make some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next sunday.

jack.  ah! that reminds me, you mentioned christenings i think, dr. chasuble?  i suppose you know how to christen all right?  [dr. chasuble looks astounded.]  i mean, of course, you are continually christening, aren’t you?

miss prism.  it is, i regret to say, one of the rector’s most constant duties in this parish.  i have often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject.  but they don’t seem to know what thrift is.

chasuble.  but is there any particular infant in whom you are interested, mr. worthing?  your brother was, i believe, unmarried, was he not?

jack.  oh yes.

chasuble.  admirably!  admirably!  [takes out watch.]  and now, dear mr. worthing, i will not intrude any longer into a house of sorrow.  i would merely beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief.  what seem to us bitter trials are often blessings in disguise.

miss prism.  this seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind.

cecily.  your brother ernest.  he arrived about half an hour ago.

jack.  what nonsense!  i haven’t got a brother.

cecily.  oh, don’t say that.  however badly he may have behaved to you in the past he is still your brother.  you couldn’t be so heartless as to disown him.  i’ll tell him to come out.  and you will shake hands with him, won’t you, uncle jack?  [runs back into the house.]

chasuble.  these are very joyful tidings.

miss prism.  after we had all been resigned to his loss, his sudden return seems to me peculiarly distressing.

jack.  my brother is in the dining-room?  i don’t know what it all means.  i think it is perfectly absurd.

cecily.  never, never, never!

jack.  well, this is the last time i shall ever do it.  [shakes with algernon and glares.]

chasuble.  it’s pleasant, is it not, to see so perfect a reconciliation?  i think we might leave the two brothers together.

miss prism.  cecily, you will come with us.

cecily.  certainly, miss prism.  my little task of reconciliation is over.

chasuble.  you have done a beautiful action to-day, dear child.

miss prism.  we must not be premature in our judgments.

cecily.  yes, it will be exactly three months on thursday.

algernon.  but how did we become engaged?

cecily.  well, ever since dear uncle jack first confessed to us that he had a younger brother who was very wicked and bad, you of course have formed the chief topic of conversation between myself and miss prism.  and of course a man who is much talked about is always very attractive.  one feels there must be something in him, after all.  i daresay it was foolish of me, but i fell in love with you, ernest.

algernon.  darling!  and when was the engagement actually settled?

gwendolen.  [severely.]  really?  your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of advanced years, resides here also?

lady bracknell.  [starting.]  miss prism!  did i hear you mention a miss prism?

chasuble.  yes, lady bracknell.  i am on my way to join her.

lady bracknell.  pray allow me to detain you for a moment.  this matter may prove to be one of vital importance to lord bracknell and myself.  is this miss prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education?

lady bracknell.  in spite of what i hear of her, i must see her at once.  let her be sent for.

lady bracknell.  every luxury that money could buy, including christening, had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents.

jack.  gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life he has been speaking nothing but the truth.  can you forgive me?

gwendolen.  i can.  for i feel that you are sure to change.
