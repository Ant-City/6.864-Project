[CHARACTER] 
[CHARACTER] is the antagonist in a doll's house, but
he is not necessarily a villain. though his willingness to allow
nora's torment to continue is cruel, [CHARACTER] is not without sympathy
for her. as he says, "even money-lenders, hacks, well, a man like
me, can have a little of what you call feeling, you know." he visits
nora to check on her, and he discourages her from committing suicide.
moreover, [CHARACTER] has reasonable motives for behaving as he does:
he wants to keep his job at the bank in order to spare his children
from the hardships that come with a spoiled reputation. unlike torvald,
who seems to desire respect for selfish reasons, [CHARACTER] desires
it for his family's sake.
	like nora, [CHARACTER] is a person who has been wronged
by society, and both nora and [CHARACTER] have committed the same crime: forgery
of signatures. though he did break the law, [CHARACTER]'s crime was
relatively minor, but society has saddled him with the stigma of
being a criminal and prohibited him from moving beyond his past.
additionally, [CHARACTER]'s claim that his immoral behavior began when
mrs. linde abandoned him for a man with money so she could provide
for her family makes it possible for us to understand [CHARACTER] as
a victim of circumstances. one could argue that society forced mrs.
linde away from [CHARACTER] and thus prompted his crime. though society's
unfair treatment of [CHARACTER] does not justify his actions, it does
align him more closely with nora and therefore tempers our perception
of him as a despicable character.
