e, and then ran home
to camden town as hard as he could pelt, to play
at blindman's-buff.

scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual
melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and
beguiled the rest of the evening with his
banker's-book, went home to bed. he lived in
chambers which had once belonged to his deceased
partner. they were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a
lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so
little business to be, that one could scarcely help
fancying it must have run there when it was a young
house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,
and forgotten the way out again. it was old enough
now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but
scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.
the yard was so dark that even scrooge, who knew
its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.
the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway
of the house, that it seemed as if the genius of
the weather sat in mournful med

itation on the
threshold.

now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all
particular about the knocker on the door, except that it
was very large. it is also a fact, that scrooge had
seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that scrooge had as little of what
is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
london, even including--which is a bold word--the
corporation, aldermen, and livery. let it also be
borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one
thought on marley, since his last mention of his
seven years' dead partner that afternoon. and then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened
that scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate
process of change--not a knocker, bu

ir was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly
motionless. that, and its livid colour, made it
horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the
face and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it
was a knocker again.

to say that he was not startled, or that his blood
was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it
had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.
but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,
turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

he did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before
he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind
it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the
sight of marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall.
but there was nothing on the back of the door, except
the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he
said "pooh, pooh!" and closed it with

the air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither
and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they
went. every one of them wore chains like marley's
ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)
were linked together; none were free. many had
been personally known to scrooge in their lives. he
had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white
waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to
its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist
a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,
upon a door-step. the misery with them all was,
clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in
human matters, and had lost the power for ever.

whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist
enshrouded them, he could not tell. but they and
their spirit voices faded together; and the night became
as it had been when he walked home.

scrooge closed the window, and examined the door
by which the ghost had entered. it was double-locked,
as he had locked it w

 but walking up and down despairingly.
scrooge looked at the ghost, and with a mournful shaking of
his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.

it opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,
came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and
often kissing him, addressed him as her "dear, dear
brother."

"i have come to bring you home, dear brother!" said the
child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.
"to bring you home, home, home!"

"home, little fan?" returned the boy.

"yes!" said the child, brimful of glee. "home, for good
and all. home, for ever and ever. father is so much kinder
than he used to be, that home's like heaven! he spoke so
gently to me one dear night when i was going to bed, that
i was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come
home; and he said yes, you should; and sent me in a coach
to bring you. and you're to be a man!" said the child,
opening her eyes, "and are never to come back here; but
first, we're

to be together all the christmas long, and have
the merriest time in all the world."

"you are quite a woman, little fan!" exclaimed the boy.

she clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his
head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on
tiptoe to embrace him. then she began to drag him, in her
childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to
go, accompanied her.

a terrible voice in the hall cried, "bring down master
scrooge's box, there!" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster
himself, who glared on master scrooge with a ferocious
condescension, and threw him into a

 man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the
clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he
saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured
in through the porch. it gave him little surprise, however;
for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and
thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried
out in this.

quiet and dark, beside him stood the phantom, with its
outstretched hand. when he roused himself from his
thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and
its situation in reference to himself, that the unseen eyes
were looking at him keenly. it made him shudder, and feel
very cold.

they left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part
of the town, where scrooge had never penetrated before,
although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. the
ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched;
the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. alleys and
archways, like so many cesspools,
