  flavius. it is no matter; let no images
    be hung with caesar's trophies. i'll about
    and drive away the vulgar from the streets;
    so do you too, where you perceive them thick.
    these growing feathers pluck'd from caesar's wing
    will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
    who else would soar above the view of men
    and keep us all in servile fearfulness.              exeunt.

portia,
decius, cicero, brutus, cassius, and casca; a great crowd
follows,
among them a soothsayer.

  caesar. calpurnia!
  casca. peace, ho! caesar speaks.

  calpurnia. here, my lord.
  caesar. stand you directly in antonio's way,

  antony. caesar, my lord?

    boy! lucius! fast asleep? it is no matter.
    enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;
    thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
    which busy care draws in the brains of men;
    therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

                           enter portia.

  portia. brutus, my lord!
  brutus. portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
    it is not for your health thus to commit
    your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
  portia. nor for yours neither. have ungently, brutus,
    stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper
    you suddenly arose and walk'd about,
    musing and sighing, with your arms across;
    and when i ask'd you what the matter was,
    you stared upon me with ungentle looks.
    i urged you further;

    fearing to strengthen that impatience

    hoping it was but an effect of humor,

    it will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
    and, could it work so much upon your shape
    as it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
    i should not know you, brutus. dear my lord,
    make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
  brutus. i am not well in health, and that is all.
  portia. brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
    he would embrace the means to come by it.
  brutus. why, so i do. good portia, go to bed.
  portia. is brutus sick, and is it physical
    to walk unbraced and suck up the humors
    of the dank morning? what, is brutus sick,
    and will he steal out of his wholesome bed
    to dare the vile contagion of the night
    and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
    to add unto his sickness? no, my brutus,
    you have some sick offense withi

  brutus. kneel not, gentle portia.
  portia. i should not need, if you were gentle brutus.

    a woman that lord brutus took to wife.
    i grant i am a woman, but withal
    a woman well reputed, cato's daughter.

    hark, hark, one knocks. portia, go in awhile,

    the secrets of my heart.
    all my engagements i will construe to thee,

  lucius. here is a sick man that would speak with you.
  brutus. caius ligarius, that metellus spake of.
    boy, stand aside. caius ligarius, how?
  ligarius. vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
  brutus. o, what a time have you chose out, brave caius,
    to wear a kerchief! would you were not sick!
  ligarius. i am not sick, if brutus have in hand
    any exploit worthy the name of honor.

scene iv.
another part of the same street, before the house of brutus.

enter portia and lucius.

  portia. i prithee, boy, run to the senate house;
    stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
    why dost thou stay?
  lucius. to know my errand, madam.
  portia. i would have had thee there, and here again,
    ere i can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
    o constancy, be strong upon my side!
    set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
    i have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
    how hard it is for women to keep counsel!
    art thou here yet?

  lucius. madam, what should i do?
    run to the capitol, and nothing else?
    and so return to you, and nothing else?
  portia. yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
    for he went sickly forth; and take good note
    what caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
    hark, boy, what noise is that?
  lucius. i hear none, madam.
  portia. prithee, listen well.
    i heard a bustling rumor like a fray,
    and the wind brings it from the capitol.
  lucius. sooth, madam, i hear nothing.

                     enter the soothsayer.

  portia. come hither, fellow;
    which way hast thou been?
  soothsayer. at mine own house, good lady.
  portia. what is't o'clock?
  soothsayer. about the ninth hour, lady.
  portia. is caesar yet gone to the capitol?
  soothsayer. madam, not yet. i go to take my stand
    to see him pa

ss on to the capitol.
  portia. thou hast some suit to caesar, hast thou not?
  soothsayer. that i have, lady. if it will please caesar
    to be so good to caesar as to hear me,
    i shall beseech him to befriend himself.
  portia. why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
  soothsayer. none that i know will be, much that i fear may
chance.
    good morrow to you. here the street is narrow,
    the throng that follows caesar at the heels,
    of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
    will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
    i'll get me to a place more void and there
    speak to great caesar as he comes along.               exit.

  brutus. lucius, a bowl of wine!                   exit lucius.
  cassius. i did not think you could have been so angry.
  brutus. o cassius, i am sick of many griefs.
  cassius. of your philosophy you make no use,
    if you give place to accidental evils.
  brutus. no man bears sorrow better. portia is dead.
  cassius. ha? portia?
  brutus. she is dead.
  cassius. how 'scaped killing when i cross'd you so?
    o insupportable and touching loss!
    upon what sickness?
  brutus. impatient of my absence,
    and grief that young octavius with mark antony
    have made themselves so strong- for with her death
    that tidings came- with this she fell distract,
    and (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire.
  cassius. and died so?
  brutus. even so.
  cassius. o ye immortal gods!

bowl of wine.
    in this i bury all unkindness, cassius.              drinks.
  cassius. my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
  fill, lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
  i cannot drink too much of brutus' love.               drinks.
  brutus. come in, titinius!                        exit lucius.

    welcome, good messala.
    now sit we close about this taper here,
    and call in question our necessities.
  cassius. portia, art thou gone?
  brutus. no more, i pray you.
    messala, i have here received letters
    that young octavius and mark antony
    come down upon us with a mighty power,
    bending their expedition toward philippi.
  messala. myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.
  brutus. with what addition?
  messala. that by proscription and bills of outlawry
    octavius, antony, and lepidus
    have put to death an hundred senators.
  brutus. there in our letters do not well agree;

    and by that order of proscription.
    had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
  brutus. no, messala.
  messala. nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
  brutus. nothing, messala.
  messala. that, methinks, is strange.
  brutus. why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
  messala. no, my lord.
  brutus. now, as you are a roman, tell me true.
  messala. then like a roman bear the truth i tell:
    for certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
  brutus. why, farewell, portia. we must die, messala.
    with meditating that she must die once
    i have the patience to endure it now.
  messala. even so great men great losses should endure.
  cassius. i have as much of this in art as you,
    but yet my nature could not bear it so.
  brutus. well, to our work alive. what do you think
    of marching to philippi presently?
  cassius. i do not think it good.
  brutus. your reason?
  cassius. this it is:
    'tis better that the enemy seek us;
    so shall he
