content.

entered a period of chaos and noise. we milled about, bickered a little, dropped utensils. finally we were
all satisfied with what we'd been able to snatch from the cupboards and refrigerator or swipe from each
other and we began quietly plastering mustard or mayonnaise on our brightly colored food. the mood was

babette  had  made  it  a  rule.  she  seemed  to  think  that  if  kids  watched  television  one  night  a  week  with
parents or stepparents, the effect would be to de-glamorize the medium in their eyes, make it wholesome
domestic  sport.  its  narcotic  undertow  and  eerie  diseased  brain-sucking  power  would  be  gradually
reduced. i felt vaguely slighted by this reasoning. the evening in fact was a subtle form of punishment for
us  all.  heinrich  sat  silent  over  his  egg  rolls.  steffie  became  upset  every  time  something  shameful  or
humiliating  seemed  about  to  happen  to  someone  on  the  screen.  she  had  a  vast  capacity  for  being

fireproofing,  the  adhesive  on  shipping  containers,  the  fumes  from  the  chlorinated  pool,  or  perhaps
something deeper, finer-grained, more closely woven into the basic state of things.

denise  and  steffie  stayed  home  that  week  as  men  in  mylex  suits  and  respirator  masks  made
systematic  sweeps  of  the  building  with  infrared  detecting  and  measuring  equipment.  because  mylex  is
itself  a  suspect  material,  the  results  tended  to  be  ambiguous  and  a  second  round  of  more  rigorous
detection had to be scheduled.

we moved into the generic food area and murray paused with his plastic basket to probe among
the white cartons and jars. i wasn't sure i understood what he was talking about. what did he mean, much
clearer? he could think and see what?

steffie  took  my  hand  and  we  walked  past  the  fruit  bins,  an  area  that  extended  about  forty-five
yards along one wall. the bins were arranged diagonally and backed by mirrors that people accidentally
punched when reaching for fruit in the upper rows.  a voice on the loudspeaker said: "kleenex  softique,
your  truck's  blocking  the  entrance."  apples  and  lemons  tumbled  in  twos  and  threes  to  the  floor  when
someone took a fruit from certain places in the stacked array. there wer

cries of children. and over it all, or under it all, a dull and unlocatable roar, as of some form of swarming
life just outside the range of human apprehension.
"did you tell denise you were sorry?"

"maybe later," steffie said. "remind me."

"she's a sweet girl and she wants to be your older sister and your friend if you'll let her."

"i don't know about friend. she's a little bossy, don't you think?"

"aside from telling her you're sorry, be sure to give her back her physicians' desk reference."

"she reads that thing all the time. don't you think that's weird?"

  i  turned  there  was  nothing  there.  i'd  been  seeing
colored spots for years but never so many, so gaily animated. murray saw wilder in another woman's cart.
the woman waved at babette and headed toward us. she lived on our street with a teenage daughter and
an  asian  baby,  chun  duc.  everyone  referred  to  the  baby  by  name,  almost  in  a  tone  of  proud
proprietorship, but no one knew who chun belonged to or where he or she had come from.
"kleenex softique, kleenex softique."


steffie was holding my hand in a way i'd come to realize, over a period of time, was not meant to
be gently possessive, as i'd thought at first, but reassuring. i was a little astonished. a firm grip that would
help me restore confidence in myself, keep me from becoming resigned to whatever melancholy moods
she thought she detected hovering about my person.
before murray went to the express line he invited us to dinner, a week from saturday.

she was transcribing names and phone numbers from an old book to a new one. there were no
addresses. her friends had phone numbers only, a race of people with a seven-bit analog consciousness.

"i'm happy to do it either way," babette said. "it's totally up to you. either i chew gum with sugar
and artificial coloring or i chew sugarless and colorless gum that's harmful to rats."
steffie got off the phone. "don't chew at all," she said. "did you ever think of that?"


babette was breaking eggs into a wooden salad bowl. she gave me a look that wondered how the
girl  could  talk  on  the  phone  and  listen  to  us  at  the  same  time.  i  wanted  to  say  because  she  finds  us

"well i can, denise. i want to. chewing happens to relax me. you're making a fuss over nothing."
steffie  managed to get our attention by the sheer pleading force of the look on her face. her hand was
over the mouthpiece of the phone. she did not speak but only formed the words.

"a little gum can't possibly hurt," babette said.

"i guess you're right. never mind. just a warning on the pack."

steffie hung up. "just hazardous to your health," she said.

i scooped wilder off a chair and gave him a noisy kiss on the ear and he shrank away in delight.

"what's that?"

"that's what people do today for a second income."

"what exactly does she do?" babette said.

"she gets a phone call from brazil. that activates her."

"then what?"

"she carries money in a suitcase the length and breadth of latin america."

tenement  in  watertown,  delivered  in  a  background  clamor  of  ticker-tape  machines.  i  realized  bee  was

we went down to the kitchen.  steffie was looking  through the brightly colored  mail for coupons,
lotteries and contests. this was the last day of  the  holiday break  for  the  grade school and  high school.

we heard sirens again, a different set this time, a larger sound-- not police, fire, ambulance. they
were air-raid sirens, i realized, and they seemed to be blowing in sawyersville, a small community to the
northeast.

steffie washed her hands at the kitchen sink and went upstairs. babette started taking things out
of  the  refrigerator.  i  grabbed  her  by  the  inside  of  the  thigh  as  she  passed  the  table.  she  squirmed

i watched the girls communicate in hooded looks.

"aren't we eating a little early tonight?" denise said.

"what do you call early?" her mother said.

denise looked at steffie.

"is it because we want to get it out of the way?" she said.

"why do we want to get it out of the way?"

"in case something happens," steffie said.

"what could happen?" babette said.


the girls looked at each other again, a solemn and lingering exchange that indicated some dark
suspicion  was  being  confirmed.  air-raid  sirens  sounded  again,  this  time  so  close  to  us  that  we  were
negatively affected, shaken to the point of avoiding each other's eyes as a way of denying that some

steffie read a coupon for baby lux, crying softly. this brought denise to life. she went upstairs to
pack some things for all of us. heinrich raced two steps at a time to the attic for his binoculars, highway
map and radio. babette went to the pantry and began gathering tins and jars with familiar life enhancing
labels.
steffie helped me clear the table.

brightly colored plastic utensils were scattered for some distance. there was no sign of victims or fresh

had been preempted by coma, convulsions, and miscarriage. if steffie had learned about déjà vu on the
radio but then missed the subsequent upgrading to more deadly conditions, it could mean she was in a

a group of  men and women carrying clipboards and walkie-talkies, non-mylex-suited officials, experts in
the new science of evacuation. steffie joined wilder in fitful sleep. the rain let up. people turned off their
headlights,  sat  uncertainly  in  their  cars.  the  long  strange  journey  was  over.  we  waited  for  a  sense  of
satisfaction  to  reach  us,  some  mood  in  the  air  of  quiet  accomplishment,  the  well-earned  fatigue  that

steffie and wilder were asleep in one of  the cots. denise sat at the other end engrossed in the
physicians' desk reference. several air mattresses were stacked against the wall. there was a long line

radio call-in show.  the radios here were tuned  mainly to just such shows. babette sat in  a camp chair,

spoke of vast distances, awesome but subtle forces. these sleeping children were like figures in an ad for
the rosicrucians, drawing a powerful beam of light from somewhere off the page. steffie turned slightly,

red cross workers handed out mimeographed instructions concerning evacuation centers. half an hour
later we found ourselves, with forty other families, in an abandoned karate studio on the top floor of a four-
story building on the main street. there were no beds or chairs. steffie refused to take off her mask.

at three p. m. steffie was still wearing the protective mask. she walked along the walls, a set of
pale green eyes, discerning, alert, secretive. she watched people as if they could not see her watching, as
if the mask covered her eyes instead of leaving them exposed. people thought she was playing a game.

always thought of as separate. the kitchen is routinely rich in such moments, perhaps for me as much as

steffie walked in saying, "i'm the only person i know who likes wednesdays." wilder's absorption

"i signed up to be a victim again. it's just before easter. so i think i have to stay here."

"another evacuation? what's the occasion this time?"

"a funny smell."

"you mean some chemical from a plant across the river?"

"i guess so."

"what do you do as the victim of a smell?"

"they have to tell us yet."

"i'm sure they won't mind excusing you just this once. i'll write a note," i said.


my first and fourth marriages were to dana breedlove, who is steffie's mother. the first marriage
worked well enough to encourage us to try again as soon as it became mutually convenient. when we did,
after the melancholy epochs of janet savory and tweedy browner, things proceeded to fall apart. but not
before stephanie rose was conceived, a star-hung night in barbados. dana was there to bribe an official.

she told me very little about her intelligence work. i knew she reviewed fiction for the cia, mainly
long serious novels with coded structures. the work left

asking each other two or three times a day since the night of the dylar revelations. "how do you feel?" as

coats, without speaking, ripping into chicken parts with our hands and teeth. there was a mood of intense
concentration,  minds  converging  on  a  single  compelling  idea.  i  was  surprised  to  find  i  was  enormously
hungry. i chewed and ate, looking only inches past my hands. this is how hunger shrinks the world. this

as  if  to  head  them  off,  as  if  she  could  not  bear  the  implications  of  their  threat,  babette  said
pleasantly, "why is it these ufos are  mostly seen upstate? the best sightings are upstate. people get
abducted and taken aboard. fanners see burn  marks where saucers landed.  a woman gives birth  to  a
ufo baby, so she says. always upstate."
"that's where the mountains are," denise said. "spaceships can hide from radar or whatever."

"why are the mountains upstate?" steffie said.


"mountains  are  always  upstate,"  denise  told  her.  "this  way  the  snow  melts  as  planned  in  the
spring and flows downhill to the reservoirs near the cities, which are kept in the lower end of the state for
exactly this reason."

i thought, momentarily, she might be right. it made a curious kind of sense. or did it? or was it
totally crazy? there had to be large cities in the northern part of some states. or were they just north of
the border in the southern part of states jus

the  golden  issue  of  my  first  marriage  to  dana  breedlove,  the  spy,  and  is  therefore  steffie's  full  sister,
although ten years and two marriages fell between. mary alice is nineteen now and lives in hawaii, where

in the evening i sped out to the airport to meet my daughter's plane. she was excited and happy,
wore mexican things. she said the people who sent her mother books to review wouldn't leave her alone.
dana was getting big thick novels every day, writing reviews which she microfilmed and sent to a secret
archive.  she  complained  of  jangled  nerves,  periods  of  deep  spiritual  fatigue.  she  told  steffie  she  was
thinking of coming in from the cold.
