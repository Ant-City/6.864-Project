    false to his children and his wife's allies;
    this is the day wherein i wish'd to fall
    by the false faith of him whom most i trusted;
    this, this all-souls' day to my fearful soul
    is the determin'd respite of my wrongs;
    that high all-seer which i dallied with
    hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
    and given in earnest what i begg'd in jest.
    thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
    to turn their own points in their masters' bosoms.
    thus margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck.
    'when he' quoth she 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
    remember margaret was a prophetess.'
    come lead me, officers, to the block of shame;
    wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
