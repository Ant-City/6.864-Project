[CHARACTER]
an american who has lived most of his life in europe,
[CHARACTER] is the type of europeanized expatriate that mrs. costello
and mrs. walker also represent. he is also closely associated with
new england puritanism: he makes his home in geneva, "the dark old
city at the other end of the lake" that james is at pains to identify
as the wellspring of calvinism, not out of necessity but by choice.
in many ways, [CHARACTER] is as central a character as daisy and
may very well be the story's true protagonist. certainly, he is
the novel's central consciousness, the character through whose eyes
we see and experience everything. 
early on, we are told that [CHARACTER] is "addicted to
observing and analyzing" feminine beauty. however, he does not appear
to be a very deep or discriminating thinker. he spends time with
his aunt not because of affection or because he takes pleasure in
her company, but because he has been taught that "one must always
be attentive to one's aunt." [CHARACTER] seems to hold in high
regard what mrs. costello tells him, about the millers as much as
anything else. out loud he defends daisy, albeit rather feebly,
but the whole novel is, in a sense, the story of [CHARACTER]'s
attempts and inability to define daisy in clear moral terms. [CHARACTER]
is preoccupied with analyzing daisy's character. he wants to be
able to define and categorize her, pin her down to some known class
of woman that he understands. daisy is a novelty to him. her candor and
spontaneity charm him, but he is also mystified by her lack of concern
for the social niceties and the rules of propriety that have been
laid down by centuries of european civilization and adopted by the
american community in rome. he befriends daisy and tries to save
her but ultimately decides that she is morally beyond redemption.
