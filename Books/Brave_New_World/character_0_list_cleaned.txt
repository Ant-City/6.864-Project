[CHARACTER] - 
                the
son of the director and linda, [CHARACTER] is the only major character
to have grown up outside of the world state. the consummate outsider,
he has spent his life alienated from his village on the new mexico
savage reservation, and he finds himself similarly unable to fit in
to world state society. his entire worldview is based on his knowledge
of shakespeare's plays, which he can quote with great facility.
