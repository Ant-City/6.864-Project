wanting a hand to giue it action,

   tam. if thou did'st know me,
thou would'st talke with me

   tit. i am not mad, i know thee well enough,
witnesse this wretched stump,
witnesse these crimson lines,
witnesse these trenches made by griefe and care,
witnesse the tyring day, and heauie night,
witnesse all sorrow, that i know thee well
for our proud empresse, mighty tamora:
is not thy comming for my other hand?
  tamo. know thou sad man, i am not tamora,
she is thy enemie, and i thy friend,
i am reuenge sent from th' infernall kingdome,
to ease the gnawing vulture of the mind,
by working wreakefull vengeance on my foes:
come downe and welcome me to this worlds light,
conferre with me of murder and of death,

rth, be it knowne to you,
that haue preseru'd her welfare in my blood,
and from her bosome tooke the enemies point,
sheathing the steele in my aduentrous body.
alas you know, i am no vaunter i,
my scars can witnesse, dumbe although they are,
that my report is iust and full of truth:
but soft, me thinkes i do digresse too much,
cyting my worthlesse praise: oh pardon me,
for when no friends are by, men praise themselues,

of this was tamora deliuered,
the issue of an irreligious moore,
chiefe architect and plotter of these woes,
the villaine is aliue in titus house,
and as he is, to witnesse this is true.
now iudge what course had titus to reuenge
these wrongs, vnspeakeable past patience,

on. o why should wrath be mute, & fury dumbe?
i am no baby i, that with base prayers
i should repent the euils i haue done.
ten thousand worse, then euer yet i did,
would i performe if i might haue my will:
if one good deed in all my life i did,
i do repent it from my very soule

   lucius. some louing friends conuey the emp[erour]. hence,
and giue him buriall in his fathers graue.
my father, and lauinia, shall forthwith
be closed in our housholds monument:
as for that heynous tyger tamora,
no funerall rite, nor man in mournfull weeds:
no mournfull bell shall ring her buriall:
but throw her foorth to beasts and birds of prey:
her life was beast-like, and deuoid of pitty,
and being so, shall haue like want of pitty.
see iustice done on aaron that damn'd moore,
from whom, our heauy happes had their beginning:
then afterwards, to order well the state,
that like euents, may ne're it ruinate.
