[CHARACTER]
raymond acts as a catalyst to the stranger's
plot. after raymond beats and abuses his mistress, he comes into
conflict with her brother, an arab. raymond draws meursault into
conflict with "the arab," and eventually meursault kills the arab
in cold blood. by drawing meursault into the conflict that eventually
results in meursault's death sentence, raymond, in a sense, causes
meursault's downfall. this responsibility on raymond's part is symbolized
by the fact that he gives meursault the gun that meursault later
uses to kill the arab. however, because the murder and subsequent
trial bring about meursault's realization of the indifference of
the universe, raymond can also be seen as a catalyst of meursault's "enlightenment."
	because raymond's character traits contrast greatly with
meursault's, he also functions as a foil for meursault. whereas
meursault is simply amoral, raymond is clearly immoral. raymond's
treatment of his mistress is violent and cruel, and he nearly kills
the arab himself before meursault talks him out of it. additionally,
whereas meursault passively reacts to the events around him, raymond
initiates action. he invites meursault to dinner and to the beach,
and he seeks out the arabs after his first fight with them.

	a good deal of ambiguity exists in raymond's relationship
with meursault. on the one hand, raymond uses meursault. he easily convinces
meursault to help him in his schemes to punish his mistress, and
to testify on his behalf at the police station. on the other hand,
raymond seems to feel some loyalty toward meursault. he asserts
meursault's innocence at the murder trial, attributing the events
leading up to the killing to "chance." it is possible that raymond
begins his relationship with meursault intending only to use him,
and then, like marie, becomes drawn to meursault's peculiarities.
