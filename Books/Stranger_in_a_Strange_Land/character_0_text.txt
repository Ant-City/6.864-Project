part one his maculate origin

 once upon a time when the world was young there was a martian named smith.
 valentine michael smith was as real as taxes but he was a race of one.
 the first human expedition from terra to mars was selected on the theory that the greatest
danger to man in space was man himself. at that time, only eight terran years after the founding of the
first human colony on luna, any interplanetary trip made by humans necessarily had to be made in weary
free-fail orbits, doubly tangent semi-ellipses--from terra to mars, two hundred fifty-eight days, the same
for the return journey, plus four hundred fift

 captain willem van tromp was a man of humanity and good sense. he radioed
ahead: "my passenger must not, repeat, must not be subjected to the strain of a public reception. provide
low-gee shuttle, stretcher and ambulance service, and anned guard."
 he sent his ship's surgeon dr. nelson along to make sure that valentine michael smith was
installed in a suite in bethesda medical center, transferred gently into a hydraulic bed, and protected
from outside contact by marine guards. van tromp himself went to an extraordinary session of the
federation high council.
 at the moment when valentine michael smith was being lifted into bed, the high minister for
science was saying testily, "granted, captain, that your authority as military commander of what was
nevertheless primarily a scientific expedition gives you the right to order

ss. you just talk and answer questions; they put it together." he whipped
out a piece of paper. "just read this and sign it. i've got the down payment with me."
 smith accepted the paper, stared thoughtfully at it, holding it upside down. the man looked at
him and muffled an exclamation. "lordyl don't you read english?"
 smith understood this well enough to answer. "no."
 "well- here, i'll read it to you, then you just put your thumb print in the square and i'll witness it.
'i, the undersigned, valentine michael smith, sometimes known as the man from mars, do grant and
assign to peerless features, limited, all and exclusive rights in my true-fact story to be titled i was a

 "repeat, please?"
 "honey, your pal appears to be the first interplanetary bastard of record. i mean 'love child.'"
 "the hell you say!"
 "please be more ladylike in your speech. do you remember anything about the crew of the
envoy? never mind, i'll hit the high points. eight people, four married couples. two couples were

 "as to how they know, you can figure that out. blood typing, rh factor, hair and eye color, all
those genetic things-you probably know more about them than i do. anyhow it is a mathematical
certainty that mary jane lyle smith was his mother and captain michael brant was his father. all the
factors are matters of record for the entire crew of the envoy; there probably never were eight people
more thoroughly measured and typed. also it gives valentine michael smith a wonderfully fine heredity;
his father had an i.q. of 163, his mother 170, and both were tops in their fields.
 "as to who cares," ben went on, "a lot of people care very much- and a lot more will care, once
this picture shapes up. ever heard of the lyle drive?"
 "of course. that's what the champion used."
 "and every other space ship, these days. who invented it?"

 "turn it off!" jill said urgently.
 "huh? shut up, pretty foots. i've got to hear this."
 "-and so, friends, i have the honor to bring you now our fellow citizen valentine michael smith,
the man from mars! mike, we all know you are tired and have not been well-but will you say a few

 the stereo scene in the tank dissolved to a semi-close-up of a man in a wheel chair. hovering
over him like a favorite uncle was douglas and on the other side of the chair was a nurse, stiff, starched,
and photogenic.

 but first jill went to the floor's public booth and called ben. his office informed her that mr.
caxton had just left town, to be gone a few days. she was startled almost speechless by this-then pulled
herself together and left word for ben to call her.
 she then called his home. he was not there; she recorded the same message.


 ben caxton had wasted no time in preparing his attempt to force his way into the presence of
valentine michael smith. he was lucky in being able to retain james oliver cavendish as his fair
witness. while any fair witness would do, the prestige of cavendish was such that a lawyer was hardly
necessary-the old gentleman had testified many times before the high court of the federation and it was
said that the wills locked up in his head represented not billions but trillions. cavendish had received his
training in total recall from the great dr. samuel renshaw himself and his professional hypnotic instruction

handed in his card and said that he wanted to see the director.
 an imperious female with a richly cultivated accent asked if he had an appointment. ben admitted
that he had none.
 "then i am afraid that your chance of seeing dr. broemer is very slight. will you state your
business?"
 "just tell him," caxton said loudly, so that others waiting would hear, "that caxton of the crow's
nest is here with a lawyer and a fair witness to interview valentine michael smith, the man from
mars."
 she was startled almost out of her professional hauteur. but she recovered and said frostily, "i

in, half concealed by the way his body sank into the plastic

he looked back at them but said nothing; his smooth, round face was expressionless.
 so far as ben could tell this was the man who had been on stereo the night before. he had a
sudden sick feeling that little jill, with the best of intentions, had tossed him a live grenade-a slander suit
that might very well bankrupt him. "you are valentine michael smith?"

 some two hours later madame alexandra vesant pushed herself back from her work table and
sighed. she had had her secretary cancel all appointments and she really had tried; several sheets of
paper, covered with diagrams and figures, and a dog-eared nautical almanac were in front of her and
testified to her efforts. alexandra vesant differed from some other practicing astrologers in that sh

 "seems to be a corpse," harshaw said meditatively. "body temperature is down to air

 "but he's not dead! can't we get him out of there? i had an awful time getting him in."
 "surely. larry, give me a hand. and quit looking so green, larry. if you puke, you'll clean it up."
between them they got valentine michael smith out of the back seat and laid him on the grass by the
pool; his body remained stiff, still huddled together. without being told dorcas had gone in and fetched
dr. harshaw's stethoscope; she set it on the ground by smith, switched it on and stepped up the gain.
 harshaw stuck the headpiece in his ears, started sounding for heart beat. "i'm afraid you're
mistaken," he said gently to jill. "this one is beyond my help. who was he?"
 jill sighed. her face was drained of expression and she answered i

attempts to grok all parts of the whole beautiful experience in all its complexity in one opus. but before it

 it was a very pretty problem.


 on the third planet valentine michael smith was not concerned with the burning issue on mars;
he had never heard of it. ills martian keeper and his keeper's water brothers had not mocked him with

bow to each shoe, unlinked. he had not been aware that his dressing had taken long; he had simply been
troubled that he had failed to repeat correctly something which jill had already taught him. he confessed
his failure abjectly to her even though he had repaired it by the time she came to fetch him.
 she soothed and reassured him, combed his hair, and herded him in to see jubal. harshaw
looked up. "hi, son. sit down."
 "hi, jubal," valentine michael smith answered gravely, sat down- waited. jill had to rid herself of
the impression that smith had bowed deeply, when in fact he had not even nodded.
 harshaw put aside a hush-mike and said, "well, boy what have you learned today?"
 smith smiled happily, then answered-as always with a slight pause. "i have today learned to do a
one-and-a-half gainer. that is a jumping, a dive, for entering our water by-"
 "i know, i saw you doing it. but you splashed. keep your toes pointed, your knees straight, and

 "i have a search warrant here for gilbert berquist, which warrant names this property, its
buildings and grounds."

 "i will do so. but i have another search warrant, similar to the first, for gillian boardman."

the house. "i do know another lawyer. i rather think, if judge holland were listening to this, habeas

 valentine michael smith swam through the murky water to the deepest part of the
pool, under the diving board, and settled himself on the bottom. he did not know why his water brother
jubal had told him to hide there; indeed he did not know that he was hiding. his water brother jubal had
told him to do this and to remain there until his water brother jill came for him; that was sufficient.
 as soon as he was sure that he was at the deepest part, he curled himself into the foetal position,

 douglas looked surprised, then grinned. "pretty sure of yourself, aren't you? well, doctor, you

 "very well, sir. i am attorney for the man from mars."
 douglas suddenly stopped looking tousled. "repeat that."

power. in fact, it may help to think of me as defacto ambassador from mars . . . in the spirit of the
larkin decision, that is to say."

 "i've often thought so, lately. nevertheless i am acting for the man from mars. and he is
prepared to negotiate."

 the other two, both the palace official and the uruguayan dignitary, started to object. jubal
turned his back on them. "let's hurry, sir-i think we have very little time." he had seen two men coming
in with what appeared to be a stand for a christmas tree and a bloody sheet-but what was almost
certainly the "martian flag." as they hurried to where he was, mike got up and was standing, waiting for
them.
 jubal said, "sir, permit me to present valentine michael smith. michael-the president of the
united states!"
 mike bowed very low.
 there was barely time to seat him on mike's right, as the improvised flag was even then being set
up behind them. music started to play, everyone stood, and a voice proclaimed:

 he looked at jill, then at patricia. "i thank you for water, my brother." he took a sip. "pat, i give
you the water of life. may you always drink deep." he passed the glass to her.
 patricia took it. "thank you. thank you, oh my dears! the 'water of life'-oh, i love you both!"
she drank thirstily.
 jill took the glass from her, finished it. "now we grow closer, my brothers."

 michael lifted his new water brother, wafted her in and placed her gently on the bed.
 valentine michael smith had grokked, when first he had known it fully, that physical human
love-very human and very physical-was not simply a necessary quickening of eggs, nor was it mere ritual
through which one grew closer; the act itself was a growing-closer, a very great goodness-and (so far as
he knew) unknown even to the old ones of his former people. he was still grokking it, trying at every
opportunity to grok its fullness. but he had long since broken through any fear that heresy lay in his
suspicion that eve

ty ("hypnotist" was a word widely used by his detractors,
along with others less mild) and, sexually, he did not fall anywhere near the human norm. great religious
leaders on earth were always either celibate, or the antithesis. (great leaders, the innovators-not
necessarily the major administrators and consolidators.) foster was not celibate.
 nor were any of his wives and high priestesses-the clincher for complete conversion and rebirth
under the new revelation usually included a ritual which valentine michael smith at a later time was to
grok as especially suited for growing-closer.
 this, of course, was nothing new; in terran history sects, cults, and major religions too numerous
to list had used essentially the same technique-but not on a major scale in america before foster's times.
foster was run out of town more than once before he "perfected" a method and organization that
permitted him to expand his capric cult. in organization he borrowed as liberally from freemasonry, from
catholicism, from the c
