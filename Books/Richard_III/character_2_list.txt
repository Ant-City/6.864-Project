King Edward IV - 
                 The
older brother of Richard and Clarence, and the king of England at
the start of the play. Edward was deeply involved in the Yorkists'
brutal overthrow of the Lancaster regime, but as king he is devoted
to achieving a reconciliation among the various political factions
of his reign. He is unaware that Richard attempts to thwart him
at every turn.
