rcourse, and he is never to be seen going
further, or, if he exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and
bad taste.

i quite agree, he said.

thus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the
end of music if not the love of beauty?

i agree, he said.

after music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.

certainly.

gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training
in it should be careful and should continue through life. now my belief
is,--and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion
in confirmation of my own, but my own belief is,--not that the good body
by any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that
the good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this
may be possible. what do you say?

yes, i agree.

then, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing
over the more particular care of the body; and in order to avoid
prolixity we will now onl

 gold or silver in them are raised
to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries. for an oracle says that
when a man of brass or iron guards the state, it will be destroyed. such
is the tale; is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in
it?

not in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of
accomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale,
and their sons' sons, and posterity after them.

i see the difficulty, i replied; yet the fostering of such a belief will
make them care more for the city and for one another. enough, however,
of the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour, while
we arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under the command of
their rulers. let them look round and select a spot whence they can best
suppress insurrection, if any prove refractory within, and also defend
themselves against enemies, who like wolves may come down on the fold
from without; there let them encamp, and when they have encamped,

addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if
they would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on
a mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is
thought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature
might be added.

but, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.

you mean to ask, i said, what will be our answer?

yes.

if we proceed along the old path, my belief, i said, is that we shall
find the answer. and our answer will be that, even as they are, our
guardians may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in
founding the state was not the disproportionate happiness of any one
class, but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a
state which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should
be most likely to find justice, and in the ill-ordered state injustice:
and, having found them, we might then decide which of t

form of amusement; and at first sight it appears
harmless.

why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by
little this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates
into manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades
contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to laws and
constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last, socrates, by an
overthrow of all rights, private as well as public.

is that true? i said.

that is my belief, he replied.

then, as i was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in
a stricter system, for if amusements become lawless, and the youths
themselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted
and virtuous citizens.

very true, he said.

and when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help of
music have gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order, in
a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany them

d fawns upon them and is skilful in
anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and
good statesman--do not these states resemble the persons whom i was
describing?

yes, he said; the states are as bad as the men; and i am very far from
praising them.

but do you not admire, i said, the coolness and dexterity of these ready
ministers of political corruption?

yes, he said, i do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom
the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are
really statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.

what do you mean? i said; you should have more feeling for them. when a
man cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare
that he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?

nay, he said, certainly not in that case.

well, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as a
play, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing; they
are always fancying that by legis

another and lead him up to the light, let them only catch the offender,

no question, he said.

this entire allegory, i said, you may now append, dear glaucon, to the
previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of
the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret
the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual
world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, i have
expressed--whether rightly or wrongly god knows. but, whether true or
false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good
appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen,
is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and
right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world,
and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and
that this is the power upon which he who would

 greater clearness
than opinion and less clearness than science: and this, in our previous
sketch, was called understanding. but why should we dispute about names
when we have realities of such importance to consider?

why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought
of the mind with clearness?

at any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions;
two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division
science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth
perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and
intellect with being; and so to make a proportion:--

as being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. and as
intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to
the perception of shadows.

but let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects
of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry, many times
longer than this has been.

will tell him how he ought to make them, and the other will attend to

of course.

the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and
badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is
told by him?

true.

the instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it
the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain
from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what
he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?

true.

but will the imitator have either? will he know from use whether or no
his drawing is correct or beautiful? or will he have right opinion
from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him
instructions about what he should draw?

neither.

then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about
