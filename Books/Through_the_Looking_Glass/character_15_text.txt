really
shall do it this time--â€™ when the path gave a sudden twist and shook
itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door.

â€˜oh, itâ€™s too bad!â€™ she cried. â€˜i never saw such a house for getting in
the way! never!â€™

however, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be
done but start again. this time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a
border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.

â€˜o tiger-lily,â€™ said alice, addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind, â€˜i wish you could talk!â€™

â€˜we can talk,â€™ said the tiger-lily: â€˜when thereâ€™s anybody worth talking
to.â€™

alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away. at length, as the tiger-lily only went
on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice--almost in a whisper.
â€˜and can all the flowers talk?â€™

â€˜as well as you can,â€™ said the tiger

-lily. â€˜and a great deal louder.â€™

â€˜it isnâ€™t manners for us to begin, you know,â€™ said the rose, â€˜and i
really was wondering when youâ€™d speak! said i to myself, â€œher face has
got some sense in it, though itâ€™s not a clever one!â€ still, youâ€™re the
right colour, and that goes a long way.â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t care about the colour,â€™ the tiger-lily remarked. â€˜if only her
petals curled up a little more, sheâ€™d be all right.â€™

alice didnâ€™t like being criticised, so she began asking questions.
â€˜arenâ€™t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody
to take care of you?â€™

â€˜thereâ€™s the tree in the middle,â€™ said the rose: â€˜what else is it good
for?â€™

â€˜but what could it do, if any danger came?â€™ alice asked.

â€˜it says â€œbough-wough!â€â€™ cried a daisy: â€˜thatâ€™s why its branches are
called boughs!â

â€˜didnâ€™t you know that?â€™ cried another daisy, and here they all began
shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices. â€˜silence, every one of you!â€™ cried the tiger-lily, waving itself
passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. â€˜they
know i canâ€™t get at them!â€™ it panted, bending its quivering head towards
alice, â€˜or they wouldnâ€™t dare to do it!â€™

â€˜never mind!â€™ alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the
daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, â€˜if you donâ€™t
hold your tongues, iâ€™ll pick you!â€™

there was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned
white.

â€˜thatâ€™s right!â€™ s

aid the tiger-lily. â€˜the daisies are worst of all. when
one speaks, they all begin together, and itâ€™s enough to make one wither
to hear the way they go on!â€™

â€˜how is it you can all talk so nicely?â€™ alice said, hoping to get it
into a better temper by a compliment. â€˜iâ€™ve been in many gardens before,
but none of the flowers could talk.â€™

â€˜put your hand down, and feel the ground,â€™ said the tiger-lily. â€˜then
youâ€™ll know why.â€™

alice did so. â€˜itâ€™s very hard,â€™ she said, â€˜but i donâ€™t see what that has
to do with it.â€™

â€˜in most gardens,â€™ the tiger-lily said, â€˜they make the beds too soft--so
that the flowers are always asleep.â€™

this sounded a very good reason, and alice was quite pleased to know it.
â€˜i never thought of that before!â€™ she said.

â€˜itâ€™s my opinion that you never think at all,â€™ the rose said in a rather
severe tone.

â€˜i never saw anybody that loo

ked stupider,â€™ a violet said, so suddenly,
that alice quite jumped; for it hadnâ€™t spoken before.

â€˜hold your tongue!â€™ cried the tiger-lily. â€˜as if you ever saw anybody!
you keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know
no more whatâ€™s going on in the world, than if you were a bud!â€™

â€˜are there any more people in the garden besides me?â€™ alice said, not
choosing to notice the roseâ€™s last remark.

â€˜thereâ€™s one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,â€™
said the rose. â€˜i wonder how you do it--â€™ (â€˜youâ€™re always wondering,â€™
said the tiger-lily), â€˜but sheâ€™s more bushy t

han you are.â€™

â€˜is she like me?â€™ alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind,
â€˜thereâ€™s another little girl in the garden, somewhere!â€™

â€˜well, she has the same awkward shape as you,â€™ the rose said, â€˜but sheâ€™s
redder--and her petals are shorter, i think.â€™

â€˜her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,â€™ the tiger-lily
interrupted: â€˜not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.â€™

â€˜but thatâ€™s not your fault,â€™ the rose added kindly: â€˜youâ€™re beginning
to fade, you know--and then one canâ€™t help oneâ€™s petals getting a little
untidy.â€™

alice didnâ€™t like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked
â€˜does she ever come out here?â€™

â€˜i daresay youâ€™ll see her soon,â€™ said the rose. â€˜sheâ€™s one of the thorny
kind.â€™

â€˜where does she wear the thorns?â€™ alice asked with some curiosit
