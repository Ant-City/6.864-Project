the interest of the stronger.

indeed, thrasymachus, and do i really appear to you to argue like an
informer?

certainly, he replied.

and do you suppose that i ask these questions with any design of
injuring you in the argument?

nay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word--i know it; but you will be
found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.

i shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any
misunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what
sense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were
saying, he being the superior, it is just that the inferior should
execute--is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the
term?

in the strictest of all senses, he said. and now cheat and play the
informer if you can; i ask no quarter at your hands. but you never will
be able, never.

and do you imagine, i said, that i am such a madman as to try and cheat,

i do not understand, he said.

let me explain: can you see, except with the eye?

certainly not.

or hear, except with the ear?

no.

these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?

they may.

but you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel, and in
many other ways?

of course.

and yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose?

true.

may we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?

we may.

then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning
when i asked the question whether the end of anything would be that
which could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any
other thing?

i understand your meaning, he said, and assent.

and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? need i ask
again whether the eye has an end?

it has.

and has not the eye an excellence?

yes.

and the ear has an end and an excellence also?

true.

and the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an end

in which the poet is the only speaker--of this the dithyramb affords
the best example; and the combination of both is found in epic, and in
several other styles of poetry. do i take you with me?

yes, he said; i see now what you meant.

i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying, that we had done
with the subject and might proceed to the style.

yes, i remember.

in saying this, i intended to imply that we must come to an
understanding about the mimetic art,--whether the poets, in narrating
their stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether
in whole or in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all
imitation be prohibited?

you mean, i suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted
into our state?

yes, i said; but there may be more than this in question: i really do
not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.

and go we will, he said.

that this quality, when found in states, is not derived from the
individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the thracians,
scythians, and in general the northern nations; and the same may be said
of the love of knowledge, which is the special characteristic of our
part of the world, or of the love of money, which may, with equal truth,
be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians.

exactly so, he said.

there is no difficulty in understanding this.

none whatever.

but the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether
these principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn
with one part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third
part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites; or whether the
whole soul comes into play in each sort of action--to determine that is
the difficulty.

yes, he said; there lies the difficulty.

then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or

that is the correct mode of describing them, he replied.

then none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe
that the same thing at the same time, in the same part or in relation to
the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary ways.

certainly not, according to my way of thinking.

yet, i said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such
objections, and prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume
their absurdity, and go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if
this assumption turn out to be untrue, all the consequences which follow
shall be withdrawn.

yes, he said, that will be the best way.

well, i said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire and
aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether
they are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in
the fact of their opposition)?

yes, he said, they are opposites.

man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule
at any other sight but that of folly and vice, or seriously inclines to
weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the good.

very true, he replied.

first, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest,
let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: is she
capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or
not at all? and is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or
can not share? that will be the best way of commencing the enquiry, and
will probably lead to the fairest conclusion.

that will be much the best way.

shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against
ourselves; in this manner the adversary's position will not be
undefended.

why not? he said.

there can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this
greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place
unless they fail in some other respect.

suppose then, i said, that we determine how far they can unite this and
the other excellences.

by all means.

in the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the
philosopher has to be ascertained. we must come to an understanding
about him, and, when we have done so, then, if i am not mistaken, we
shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and
that those in whom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in
the state.

what do you mean?

let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort
which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and
corruption.

aspirations, and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of hellenes
and of barbarians, and having got such notions into his head will he
not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless
pride?

to be sure he will.

now, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him
and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which can
only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse
circumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?

far otherwise.

and even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural
reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken
captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they think that
they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap
from his companionship? will they not do and say anything to prev

i do indeed wish, i replied, that i could pay, and you receive, the
account of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,
however, this latter by way of interest, and at the same time have a
care that i do not render a false account, although i have no intention
of deceiving you.

yes, we will take all the care that we can: proceed.

yes, i said, but i must first come to an understanding with you, and
remind you of what i have mentioned in the course of this discussion,
and at many other times.

what?

the old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and so
of other things which we describe and define; to all of them the term
'many' is applied.

true, he said.

and there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other
things to which the term 'many' is applied there is an absolute; for
they may be brought under a single idea, which is called the essence o

i understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to
be describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, i
understand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of
dialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as
they are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also
contemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because
they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those who
contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason
upon them, although when a first principle is added to them they are
cognizable by the higher reason. and the habit which is concerned
with geometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term
understanding and not reason, as being intermediate between opinion and
reason.

have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth.

arrangement.

the ranks of the army at troy; which implies that they had never been
numbered before, and agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been
incapable of counting his own feet--how could he if he was ignorant of
number? and if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?

i should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.

can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?

certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of
military tactics, or indeed, i should rather say, if he is to be a man
at all.

i should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of
this study?

what is your notion?

it appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and
which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly
used; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.

will you explain your meaning? he said.

i will try, i said; and i wish you would share the enquiry w

yes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as good as a play to hear them talking
about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears
close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their
neighbour's wall--one set of them declaring that they distinguish an
intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be
the unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have
passed into the same--either party setting their ears before their
understanding.

you mean, i said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and
rack them on the pegs of the instrument: i might carry on the metaphor
and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives,
and make accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and
forwardness to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore i will
only say that these are not the men, and that i am referring to the
pythagoreans, of whom i was just now proposing to enquire about harmony.

ple and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in
order to make her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is literally
buried in an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards;
and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the
sciences which we have been discussing. custom terms them sciences,
but they ought to have some other name, implying greater clearness
than opinion and less clearness than science: and this, in our previous
sketch, was called understanding. but why should we dispute about names
when we have realities of such importance to consider?

why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought
of the mind with clearness?

at any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions;
two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division
science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth
perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and
intellect with being; and so to ma

ke a proportion:--

as being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion. and as
intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to
the perception of shadows.

but let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects
of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry, many times
longer than this has been.

as far as i understand, he said, i agree.

and do you also agree, i said, in describing the dialectician as one who
attains a conception of the essence of each thing? and he who does not
possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in
whatever degree he fails, may in that degree al

he who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and
punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the
gentler element in him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected and
ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom, more
than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and health,
in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body.

certainly, he said.

to this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies
of his life. and in the first place, he will honour studies which
impress these qualities on his soul and will disregard others?

clearly, he said.

in the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, and
so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures, that
he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first object
will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he is likely
thereby to gain temperance, but he wi

there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule
about poetry.

to what do you refer?

to the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to be
received; as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have
been distinguished.

what do you mean?

speaking in confidence, for i should not like to have my words repeated
to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe--but i do not
mind saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the
understanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true
nature is the only antidote to them.

explain the purport of your remark.

well, i will tell you, although i have always from my earliest youth had
an awe and love of homer, which even now makes the words falter on
my lips, for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that
charming tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than the
truth, and therefore i will speak out.

very good, he said.

listen to me then, or rathe

ividuals, beginning
with homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the like,
but the truth they never reach? the poet is like a painter who, as
we have already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though he
understands nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for
those who know no more than he does, and judge only by colours and
figures.

quite so.

in like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on
the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature only
enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as he is,
and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of cobbling,
or of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre and harmony and
rhythm, he speaks very well--such is the sweet influence which melody
and rhythm by nature have. and i think that you must have observed again
and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped
of the colours which music puts upon them, and recited

in simple prose.

yes, he said.

they are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only
blooming; and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?

exactly.

here is another point: the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing
of true existence; he knows appearances only. am i not right?

yes.

then let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half
an explanation.

proceed.

of the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?

yes.

and the worker in leather and brass will make them?

certainly.

but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? nay,
hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the
horseman who knows how to use them--he knows their right form.

most true.

and may we not say the same of all things?

what?

that there are three arts which

shadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon us
like magic.

true.

and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the
rescue of the human understanding--there is the beauty of them--and the
apparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery
over us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?

most true.

and this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational
principle in the soul?

to be sure.

and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are
equal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an
apparent contradiction?

true.

but were we not saying that such a co
