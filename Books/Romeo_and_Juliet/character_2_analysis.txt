Friar Lawrence 
Friar Lawrence occupies a strange position in Romeo
and Juliet. He is a kindhearted cleric who helps Romeo
and Juliet throughout the play. He performs their marriage and gives
generally good advice, especially in regard to the need for moderation.
He is the sole figure of religion in the play. But Friar Lawrence
is also the most scheming and political of characters in the play:
he marries Romeo and Juliet as part of a plan to end the civil strife
in Verona; he spirits Romeo into Juliet's room and then out of Verona;
he devises the plan to reunite Romeo and Juliet through the deceptive
ruse of a sleeping potion that seems to arise from almost mystic
knowledge. This mystical knowledge seems out of place for a Catholic
friar; why does he have such knowledge, and what could such knowledge mean?
The answers are not clear. In addition, though Friar Lawrence's
plans all seem well conceived and well intentioned, they serve as
the main mechanisms through which the fated tragedy of the play
occurs. Readers should recognize that the Friar is not only subject
to the fate that dominates the play--in many ways he brings that
fate about.
