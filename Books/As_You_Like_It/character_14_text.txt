    therefore, courage, good aliena.

  celia. i pray you bear with me; i cannot go no further.

  touchstone. for my part, i had rather bear with you than bear you;
    yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you; for i think you
    have no money in your purse.

  rosalind. well,. this is the forest of arden.

  touchstone. ay, now am i in arden; the more fool i; when i was at
    home i was in a better place; but travellers must be content.

                        enter corin and silvius


  rosalind. ay, be so, good touchstone. look you, who comes here, a
    young man and an old in solemn talk.

  corin. that is the way to make her scorn you still.

  silvius. o corin, that thou knew'st how i do love her!

  corin. i partly guess; for i have lov'd ere now.

  silvius. no, corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
    though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
    as ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.
    but if thy love were ever like to mine,

  as sure i think did never man love so,
    how many actions most ridiculous
    hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?

  corin. into a thousand that i have forgotten.

  silvius. o, thou didst then never love so heartily!
    if thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
    that ever love did make thee run into,
    thou hast not lov'd;
    or if thou hast not sat as i do now,
    wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
    thou hast not lov'd;
    or if thou hast not broke from company
    abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
    thou hast not lov'd.
    o phebe, phebe, phebe!

    is much upon my fashion.

  celia. i pray you, one of you question yond man
    if he for gold will give us any food;
    i faint almost to death.

  touchstone. holla, you clown!

  rosalind. peace, fool; he's not thy ensman.

  corin. who calls?

  touchstone. your betters, sir.

  corin. else are they very wretched.

  rosalind. peace, i say. good even to you, friend.

  corin. and to you, gentle sir, and to you all.

  rosalind. i prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
    can in this desert place buy entertainment,
    bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
    here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd,
    and faints for succour.

    my master is of churlish disposition,
    and little recks to find the way to heaven
    by doing deeds of hospitality.
    besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed,
    are now on sale; and at our sheepcote now,
    by reason of his absence, there is nothing
    that you will feed on; but what is, come see,
    and in my voice most welcome shall you be.

  rosalind. what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

  corin. that young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
    that little cares for buying any thing.

  rosalind. i pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
    buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
    and thou shalt have to pay for it of us.

  celia. and we will mend thy wages. i like this place,
    and willingly could waste my time in it.

    and thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey
    with thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
    thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
    o rosalind! these trees shall be my books,
    and in their barks my thoughts i'll character,
    that every eye which in this forest looks
    shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.

  corin. and how like you this shepherd's life, master touchstone?

  touchstone. truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
    life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is nought.
    in respect that it is solitary, i like it very well; but in
    respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. now in
    respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect
    it is not in the court, it is tedious. as it is a spare life,

ok you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more plenty
    in it, it goes much against my stomach. hast any philosophy in
    thee, shepherd?

  corin. no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at
    ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is
    without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,
    and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a
    great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath
    learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,
    or comes of a very dull kindred.

    court, shepherd?

  corin. no, truly.

  touchstone. then thou art damn'd.

  corin. nay, i hope.

  touchstone. truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
    one side.

  corin. for not being at court? your reason.

  touchstone. why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
    manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must
    be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. thou art
    in a parlous state, shepherd.

  corin. not a whit, touchstone. those that are good manners at the
    court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the
    country is most mockable at the court. you told me you salute not

    uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.

  touchstone. instance, briefly; come, instance.

  corin. why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
    know, are greasy.

  touchstone. why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not the
    grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?
    shallow, shallow. a better instance, i say; come.

  corin. besides, our hands are hard.

  touchstone. your lips will feel them the sooner. shallow again.
    a more sounder instance; come.

  corin. and they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our
    sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? the courtier's hands are
    perfum'd with civet.

  touchstone. most shallow man! thou worm's meat in respect of a good
    piece of flesh indeed! learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is
    of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a

  corin. you have too courtly a wit for me; i'll rest.

  touchstone. wilt thou rest damn'd? god help thee, shallow man!
    god make incision in thee! thou art raw.

  corin. sir, i am a true labourer: i earn that i eat, get that i
    wear; owe no man hate, envy no man's happiness; glad of other
    men's good, content with my harm; and the greatest of my pride is
    to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.

  touchstone. that is another simple sin in you: to bring the ewes
    and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the
    copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray
    a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked-pated,

    patience, good people.'

  celia. didst thou hear these verses?

  rosalind. o, yes, i heard them all, and more too; for some of them
    had in them more feet than the verses would bear.

  celia. that's no matter; the feet might bear the verses.

  rosalind. ay, but the feet were lame, and could not bear themselves
    without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse.

    there is such a man as orlando?

  celia. o, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses, speaks brave
    words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite
    traverse, athwart the heart of his lover; as a puny tilter, that
    spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
    goose. but all's brave that youth mounts and folly guides.

    that was his mistress.
