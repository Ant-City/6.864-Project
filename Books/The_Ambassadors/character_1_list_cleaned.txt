[CHARACTER] - 
the focus of the novel and the reason for strether's
visit to paris. chad is a handsome, debonair, and independently
wealthy bachelor currently involved in a love affair with the older
madame marie de vionnet. at first, it seems that paris affects chad
in only positive ways: chad has grown from the callow, immature
boy he was in woollett into a polished, gentleman, comfortable in
parisian high society and often host to a wide, interesting group
of friends. but chad has no real attachment to europe or to his
lover. instead, chad subscribes to the american ideals of monetary
success and to the social status that comes along with it. he wants
to return to the united states to take over the family business,
even after strether encourages him to stay in europe. paris affects
chad only superficially, and he looks forward to returning home
to woollett after his enjoyable, but not profound, experience in
europe.
