[CHARACTER]
siddhartha's best friend, [CHARACTER], is also an earnest
spiritual pilgrim but does not question teachings to the same extent
siddhartha does. for example, though [CHARACTER] is excited at the chance
to follow gotama, siddhartha goes along but says he has lost his
faith in teachers. when siddhartha decides to leave gotama's side,
[CHARACTER] instead remains stalwartly committed. [CHARACTER] does not choose
his own path but follows the suggestions of others. similarly, when
the two old friends meet in the end, [CHARACTER] quickly apprentices
himself to siddhartha because siddhartha has attained the nirvana
they both seek. the significant difference between [CHARACTER] and siddhartha
is that [CHARACTER] is primarily a follower, whereas siddhartha is
more inclined to strike out on his own path. this difference is one
of the reasons siddhartha is eventually able to achieve enlightenment
through his own efforts, while [CHARACTER] needs assistance in order
to achieve the same state. siddhartha is better able to see the
truth before him because of his self-reliance. [CHARACTER] needs others
to point out the wisdom he should follow and is unable to see when
he is following a flawed path and, ultimately, when he is nearing
enlightenment.
at the beginning of their quest, when [CHARACTER]
joins the samanas, he may well have gone along simply to be with
his friend. however, the severity and austere nature of their new
lifestyle leaves little reason to doubt [CHARACTER]'s conviction. he
may be more of a follower than siddhartha is, but his conviction
and determination to find enlightenment are still strong. he does, after
all, eventually find enlightenment, just as siddhartha does--he just
arrives at it in a different way.
