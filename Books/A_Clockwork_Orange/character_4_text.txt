‚Äúwith respect, sir, i object very strongly to what you said then. i am not a common criminal, sir, and i am not unsavoury. the others may be unsavoury but i am not.‚Äù the chief chasso went all purple and creeched:

‚Äúyou shut your bleeding hole, you. don‚Äôt you know who this is?‚Äù

‚Äúall right, all right,‚Äù said this big veck. then he turned to the governor and said: ‚Äúyou can use him as a trail-blazer. he‚Äôs young, bold, vicious. brodsky will deal with him tomorrow and you can sit in and watch brodsky. it works all right, don‚Äôt worry about that. this vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.‚Äù

and those hard slovos, brothers, were like the beginning of my freedom.

that very same evening i was dragged down nice and gentle by brutal tolchocking chassos to viddy the governor in his holy of holies holy office. the governor looked very weary at me and said: ‚Äúi don‚Äôt suppose you know who

so i said, trying to be like respectful and accomodating:

‚Äúsir.‚Äù and then the chief chasso, who was standing all red and burly behind the governor‚Äôs chair, creeched:

‚Äúshut your filthy hole, you scum.‚Äù

‚Äúall right, all right,‚Äù said the like tired and fagged-out governor. ‚Äúyou, 6655321, are to be reformed. tomorrow you go to this man brodsky. it is believed that you will be able to leave state custody in a little over a fortnight. in a little over a fortnight you will be out again in the big free world, no longer a number. i suppose,‚Äù and he snorted a bit here, ‚Äúthat prospect pleases you?‚Äù i said nothing so the chief chasso creeched:

‚Äúanswer, you filthy young swine, when the governor asks you a question.‚Äù so i said:

‚Äúoh, yes, sir. thank you very much, sir. i‚Äôve done my best here, really i have. i‚Äôm very gratef

after i had been given a nice chasha of real horrorshow coffee and some old gazettas and mags to look at while peeting it, this first veck in white came in, the one who had like signed for me, and he said: ‚Äúaha, there you are,‚Äù a silly sort of a veshch to say but it didn‚Äôt sound silly, this veck being so like nice. ‚Äúmy name,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis dr. branom. i‚Äôm dr. brodsky‚Äôs assistant. with your permission, i‚Äôll just give you the usual brief overall examination.‚Äù and he took the old stetho out of his right carman. ‚Äúwe must make sure you‚Äôre quite fit, mustn‚Äôt we? yes indeed, we must.‚Äù so while i lay there with my pyjama top off and he did this, that and the other, i said:

‚Äúwhat exactly is it, sir, that you‚Äôre going to do?‚Äù

‚Äúoh,‚Äù said dr. branom, his cold stetho going all down my back, ‚Äúit‚Äôs quite simple, really. we just show you s

what happened now was that one white-coated veck strapped my gulliver to a like head-rest, singing to himself all the time some vonny cally pop-song. ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs this for?‚Äù i said. and this veck replie

‚Äúhorrorshow is right, friend. a real show of horrors.‚Äù and then i had like a cap stuck on my gulliver and i could viddy all wires running away from it, and they stuck a like suction pad on my belly and one on the old tick-tocker, and i could just about viddy wires running away from those. then there was the shoom of a door opening and you could tell some very important chelloveck was coming in by the way the white-coated under-vecks went all stiff. and then i viddied this dr. brodsky. he was a malenky veck, very fat, with all curly hair curling all over his gulliver, and on his spuddy nose he had very thick ochkies. i could just viddy that he had a real horrorshow suit on, absolutely the heighth of fashion, and he had a like very delicate and subtle von of operating-theatres coming from him. with him was dr. branom, all smiling like as though to give me confidence. ‚Äúeverything ready?‚Äù said dr. brodsky in a very breathy goloss. then i could slooshy voices saying right ri

 they call cutting or editing or some such veshch. for it was very real. and when it came to the sixth or seventh malchick leering and smecking and then going into it and the devotchka creeching on the sound-track like bezoomny, then i began to feel sick. i had like pains all over and felt i could sick up and at the same time not sick up, and i began to feel like in distress, o my brothers, being fixed rigid too on this chair. when this bit of film was over i could slooshy the goloss of this dr. brodsky from over by the switchboard saying: ‚Äúreaction about twelve point five? promising, promising.‚Äù

then we shot straight into another lomtick of film, and this time it was of just a human litso, a very like pale human face held still and having different nasty veshches done to it. i was sweating a malenky bit with the pain in my guts and a horrible thirst and my gulliver going throb throb throb, and it seemed to me that if i could not viddy this bit of film i would perhaps be not so sick. bu

 viddying what was being done and hearing the most ghastly creechings coming from this litso. i knew it could not really be real, but that made no difference. i was heaving away but could not sick, viddying first a britva cut out an eye, then slice down the cheek, then go rip rip rip all over, while red krovvy shot on to the camera lens. then all the teeth were like wrenched out with a pair of pliers, and the creeching and the blood were terrific. then i slooshied this very pleased goloss of dr. brodsky going: ‚Äúexcellent, excellent, excellent.‚Äù

the next lomtick of film was of an old woman who kept a shop being kicked about amid very gromky laughter by a lot of malchicks, and these malchicks broke up the shop and then set fire to it. you could viddy this poor starry ptitsa trying to crawl out of the flames, screaming and creeching, but having had her leg broke by these malchicks kicking her she could not move. so then all the flames went roaring round her, and you could viddy her agonize

d litso like appealing through the flames and the disappearing in the flames, and then you could slooshy the most gromky and agonized and agonizing screams that ever came from a human goloss. so this time i knew i had to sick up, so i creeched:

‚Äúi want to be sick. please let me be sick. please bring something for me to be sick into.‚Äù but this dr. brodsky called back:

‚Äúimagination only. you‚Äôve nothing to worry about. next film coming up.‚Äù that was perhaps meant to be a joke, for i heard a like smeck coming from the dark. and then i was forced to viddy a most nasty film about japanese torture. it was the 1939‚Äì45 war, and there were soldiers being fixed to trees with nails and having fires lit under them and having their yarbles cut off, and you even viddied a gulliver being sliced off a soldier with a sword, and then with his head roll

ing about and the rot and glazzies looking alive still, the plott of this soldier actually ran about, krovvying like a fountain out of the neck, and then it dropped, and all the time there was very very loud laughter from the japanese. the pains i felt now in my belly and the headache and the thirst were terrible, and they all seemed to be coming out of the screen. so i creeched:

‚Äústop the film! please, please stop it! i can‚Äôt stand any more.‚Äù and then the goloss of this dr. brodsky said:

‚Äústop it? stop it, did you say? why, we‚Äôve hardly started.‚Äù and he and the others smecked quite loud.

i do not wish to describe, brothers, what other horrible veshches i was like forced to viddy that afternoon. the like minds of this dr. brodsky and dr. branom and the others in white coats, and remember there was this devotchka twiddling with the knobs and watching the meters, they must have been more cally and filthy than any prestoopnick in the staja itself. because

 i did not think it was possible for any veck to even think of making films of what i was forced to viddy, all tied to this chair and my glazzies made to be wide open. all i could do was to creech very gromky for them to turn it off, turn it off, and that like part drowned the noise of dratsing and fillying and also the music that went with it all. you can imagine it was like a terrible relief when i‚Äôd viddied the last bit of film, and this dr. brodsky said, in a very yawny and bored like goloss: ‚Äúi think that should be enough for day one, don‚Äôt you, branom?‚Äù and there i was with the lights switched on, my gulliver throbbing like a bolshy big engine that makes pain, and my rot all dry and cally inside, and feeling i could like sick up every bit of pishcha i had ever eaten, o my brothers, since the day i was like weaned. ‚Äúall right,‚Äù said this dr. brodsky, ‚Äúhe can be taken back to his bed.‚Äù then he like patted me on the pletcho a

at that like horrible nightmare was in the past and all over. and then dr. branom came in, all nice and smiling. he said:

‚Äúwell, by my calculations you should be starting to feel all right again. yes?‚Äù

‚Äúsir,‚Äù i said, like wary. i did not quite kopat what he was getting at govoreeting about calculations, seeing that getting better from feeling bolnoy is like your own affair and nothing to do with calculations. he sat down, all nice and droogy, on the bed‚Äôs edge and said:

‚Äúdr. brodsky is pleased with you. you had a very positive response. tomorrow, of course, there‚Äôll be two sessions, morning and afternoon, and i should imagine that you‚Äôll be feeling a bit limp at the end of the day. but we have to be hard on you, you have to be cured.‚Äù i said:

‚Äúyou mean i have to sit through‚Äî? you mean i have to look at‚Äî? oh, no,‚Äù i said. ‚Äúit was horrible.‚Äù

‚Äúof course it was horrible,‚Äù smiled dr. branom. ‚Äúviolence is a very horrible thing. that‚Äôs what you‚Äôr

‚Äúbut,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt understand. i don‚Äôt understand about feeling sick like i did. i never used to feel sick before. i used to feel like very the opposite. i mean, doing it or watching it i used to feel real horrorshow. i just don‚Äôt understand why or how or what‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúlife is a very wonderful thing,‚Äù said dr. branom in a like very holy goloss. ‚Äúthe processes of life, the make-up of the human organism, who can fully understand these miracles? dr. brodsky is, of course, a remarkable man. what is happening to you now is what should happen to any normal healthy human organism contemplating the actions of the forces of evil, the workings of the principle of destruction. you are being made sane, you are being made healthy.‚Äù

‚Äúthat i will not have,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúnor can understand at all. what you‚Äôve been doing is to make me feel very ill.‚Äù

what it was now was the starry 1939‚Äì45 war again, and it was a very blobby and liny and crackly film you could viddy had been made by the germans. it opened with german eagles and the nazi flag with that like crooked cross that all malchicks at school love to draw, and then there were very haughty and nadmenny like german officers walking through streets that were all dust and bomb-holes and broken buildings. then

‚Äúwhat‚Äôs all this about sin, eh?‚Äù

‚Äúthat,‚Äù i said, very sick. ‚Äúusing ludwig van like that. he did no harm to anyone. beethoven just wrote music.‚Äù and then i was really sick and they had to bring a bowl that was in the shape of like a kidney.

‚Äúmusic,‚Äù said dr. brodsky, like musing. ‚Äúso you‚Äôre keen on music. i know nothing about it myself. it‚Äôs a useful emotional heightener, that‚Äôs all i know.

 well, well. what do you think about that, eh, branom?‚Äù

‚Äúit can‚Äôt be helped,‚Äù said dr. branom. ‚Äúeach man kills the thing he loves, as the poet-prisoner said. here‚Äôs the punishment element, perhaps. the governor ought to be pleased.‚Äù

‚Äúgive me a drink,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúfor bog‚Äôs sake.‚Äù

‚Äúloosen him,‚Äù ordered dr. brodsky. ‚Äúfetch him a carafe of ice-cold water.‚Äù so then these under-vecks got to work and soon i was peeting gallons and gallons of water and it was like heaven, o my brothers. dr. brodsky said:

‚Äúyou seem a sufficiently intelligent young man. you seem, too, to be not without taste. you‚Äôve just got this violence thing, haven‚Äôt you? violence and theft, theft being an aspect of violence.‚Äù i didn‚Äôt govoreet a single slovo, brothers, i was still feeling sick, though getting a malenky bit b

etter now. but it had been a terrible day. ‚Äúnow then,‚Äù said dr. brodsky, ‚Äúhow do you think this is done? tell me, what do you think we‚Äôre doing to you?‚Äù

‚Äúyou‚Äôre making me feel ill. i‚Äôm ill when i look at those filthy pervert films of yours. but it‚Äôs not really the films that‚Äôs doing it. but i feel that if you‚Äôll stop these films i‚Äôll stop feeling ill.‚Äù

‚Äúright,‚Äù said dr. brodsky. ‚Äúit‚Äôs association, the oldest educational method in the world. and what really causes you to feel ill?‚Äù

‚Äúthese grahzny sodding veshches that come out of my gulliver and my plott,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what it is.‚Äù

‚Äúquaint,‚Äù said dr. brodsky, like smiling, ‚Äúthe dialect of the tribe. do you know anything of its provenance, branom?‚Äù

‚Äúodd bits of old rhyming slang,‚Äù said dr. branom, who did not look quite so much like a friend any more. ‚Äúa bit of gipsy talk, too.

‚Äúall right, all right, all right,‚Äù said dr. brodsky, like impatient and not interested any more. ‚Äúwell,‚Äù he said to me, ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt the wires. it‚Äôs nothing to do with what‚Äôs fastened to you. those are just for measuring your reactions. what is it, then?‚Äù

i viddied then, of course, what a bezoomny shoot i was not to notice that it was the hypodermic shots in the rooker.

‚Äúoh,‚Äù i creeched, ‚Äúoh, i viddy all now. a filthy cally vonny trick. an act of treachery, sod you, and you won‚Äôt do it again.‚Äù

less than a fortnight, o my brothers and friends, it was like an age. it was like from the beginning of the world to the end of it. to finish the fourteen years without remission in the staja would have been nothing to it. every day it was the same. when the devotchka with the hypodermic came round, though, four days after this govoreeting with dr. brodsky and dr. branom, i said: ‚Äúoh, no you won‚Äôt,‚Äù and tolchocked her on the rooker, and the syringe went tinkle clatter on to the floor. that was like to viddy what they would do. what they did was to get four or five real bolshy white-coated bastards of under-vecks to hold me down on the bed, tolchocking me with grinny litsos close to mine, and then this nurse ptitsa said: ‚Äúyou wicked naughty little devil, you,‚Äù while she jabbed my rooker with another syringe and squirted this stuff in rea

‚Äúall right, that will do very well.‚Äù then this horrible veck sort of bowed and danced off like an actor while the lights came up on me blinking and with my rot square for howling. dr. brodsky said to the audience: ‚Äúour subject is, you see, impelled towards the good by, paradoxically, being impelled towards evil. the intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. to counter these the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. any

‚Äúchoice,‚Äù rumbled a rich deep goloss. i viddied it belonged to the prison charlie. ‚Äúhe has no real choice, has he? self-interest, fear of physical pain, drove him to that grotesque act of self-abasement. its insincerity was clearly to be seen. he ceases to be a wrongdoer. he ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice.‚Äù

‚Äúthese are subtleties,‚Äù like smiled dr. brodsky. ‚Äúwe are not concerned with motive, with the higher ethics. we are concerned only with cutting down crime‚Äî‚Äù

‚Äúand,‚Äù chipped in this bolshy well-dressed minister, ‚Äúwith relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons.‚Äù

‚Äúhear hear,‚Äù said somebody.

there was a lot of govoreeting and arguing then and i just stood there, brothers, like completely ignored by all these ignorant bratchnies, so i creeched out:

‚Äúoh, if only i could believe that.‚Äù and you could viddy the governor give him a look like meaning that he would not climb so high in like prison religion as he thought he would. then loud arguing started again, and then i could slooshy the slovo love being thrown around, the prison charles himself creeching as loud as any about perfect love casteth out fear and all that cal. and now dr. brodsky said, smiling all over his litso:

‚Äúhe will be your true christian,‚Äù dr. brodsky was creeching out, ‚Äúready to turn the other cheek, ready to be crucified rather than crucify, sick to the very heart at the thought even of killing a fly.‚Äù and that was right, brothers, because when he said that i thought of killing a fly and felt just that tiny bit sick, but i pushed the sickness and pain back by thinking of the fly being fed with bits of sugar and looked after like a bleeding pet and all that cal. ‚Äúreclamation,‚Äù he creeched. ‚Äújoy before the angels of god.‚Äù

perhaps, i thought, if i ittied off to the public biblio around the corner i might find some book on the best way of snuffing it with no pain. i thought of myself dead and how sorry everybody was going to be, pee and em and that cally vonny joe who was a like usurper, and also dr. brodsky and dr. branom and that inferior interior minister and every veck else. and the boastful vonny government too. so out i scatted into the winter, and it was afternoon now, near two o‚Äôclock, as i could viddy from the bolshy center timepiece, so that me being in the land with the old moloko plus must have took like longer than i thought. i walked down marghanita boulevard and then turned into boothby avenue, then round the corner again, and there was the public biblio.

it was a starry cally s
