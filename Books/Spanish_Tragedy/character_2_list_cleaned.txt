[CHARACTER]  - 
      one of horatio's murderers. [CHARACTER]'s character remains fairly constant throughout the play. he is a proud verbal manipulator and a machiavellian plotter. a great deceiver and manipulator of others, horatio unsurprisingly has an enthusiasm for the theater. [CHARACTER] has a foil in horatio; they are both brave young men, but horatio's directness, impulsiveness, and honesty, contrast and highlight [CHARACTER]'s guardedness, secretiveness, and deception.
