each, and by demanding principal upon the spot, together with full
interest to the very day, makes them both feel the full extent of their
obligations.

as the reader (for i hate your ifs) has a thorough knowledge of human
nature, i need not say more to satisfy him, that my hero could not go
on at this rate without some slight experience of these incidental
mementos. to speak the truth, he had wantonly involved himself in a
multitude of small book-debts of this stamp, which, notwithstanding
eugenius's frequent advice, he too much disregarded; thinking, that
as not one of them was contracted thro' any malignancy;--but, on the
contrary, from an honesty of mind, and a mere jocundity of humour, they
would all of them be cross'd out in course.

eugenius would never admit this; and would often tell him, that one day
or other he would certainly be reckoned with; and he would often add,
in an accent of sorrowful apprehension,--to the uttermost mite. to which
yorick, with his usual carelessness of

heart, would as often answer with
a pshaw!--and if the subject was started in the fields,--with a hop,
skip, and a jump at the end of it; but if close pent up in the social
chimney-corner, where the culprit was barricado'd in, with a table and
a couple of arm-chairs, and could not so readily fly off in a
tangent,--eugenius would then go on with his lecture upon discretion in
words to this purpose, though somewhat better put together.

trust me, dear yorick, this unwary pleasantry of thine will sooner or
later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties, which no after-wit can
extricate thee out of.--in these sallies, too oft, i see, it happens,
that a person laughed at, considers himself in the light of a person
injured, with all the rights of such a situation belonging to him; and
when thou viewest him in that ligh

yorick scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny read over
to him, but with a tear stealing from his eye, and a promissory look
attending it, that he was resolved, for the time to come, to ride his
tit with more sobriety.--but, alas, too late!--a grand confederacy
with...and...at the head of it, was formed before the first prediction
of it.--the whole plan of the attack, just as eugenius had foreboded,
was put in execution all at once,--with so little mercy on the side of
the allies,--and so little suspicion in yorick, of what was carrying
on against him,--that when he thought, good easy man! full surely
preferment was o'ripening,--they had smote his root, and then he fell,
as many a worthy man had fallen before him.

yorick, however, fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for some
time; till, overpowered by numbers, and worn out at length by the
calamities of the war,--bu

t more so, by the ungenerous manner in which
it was carried on,--he threw down the sword; and though he kept up
his spirits in appearance to the last, he died, nevertheless, as was
generally thought, quite broken-hearted.

what inclined eugenius to the same opinion was as follows:

a few hours before yorick breathed his last, eugenius stept in with an
intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him. upon his drawing
yorick's curtain, and asking how he felt himself, yorick looking up in
his face took hold of his hand,--and after thanking him for the many
tokens of his friendship to him, for which, he said, if it was their
fate to meet hereafter,--he would thank him again and again,--he told
him, he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for
ever.--i hope not, answered eugenius, with tears trickling down 
 
 ___________________________
 
his
cheeks, and with the tenderest tone that ever man spoke.--i hope not,
yorick, said he.--yorick replied, with a look up, and a gentle squeeze
of eugenius's hand, and that was all,--but it cut eugenius to his
heart.--come,--come, yorick, quoth eugenius, wiping his eyes, and
summoning up the man within him,--my dear lad, be comforted,--let not
all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most
wants them;--who knows what resources are in store, and what the power
of god may yet do for thee!--yorick laid his hand upon his heart, and
gently shook his head;--for my part, continued eugenius, crying bitterly
as he uttered the words,--i declare i know not, yorick, how to part with
thee, and would gladly flatter my hopes, added

eugenius, chearing up
his voice, that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop,
and that i may live to see it.--i beseech thee, eugenius, quoth yorick,
taking off his night-cap as well as he could with his left hand,--his
right being still grasped close in that of eugenius,--i beseech thee to
take a view of my head.--i see nothing that ails it, replied eugenius.
then, alas! my friend, said yorick, let me tell you, that 'tis so
bruised and mis-shapened with the blows which...and..., and some others
have so unhandsomely given me in the dark, that i might say with sancho
panca, that should i recover, and 'mitres thereupon be suffered to
rain down from heaven as thick as hail, not one of them would fit
it.'--yorick's last breath was hanging upon his trembling lips ready to
depart as he uttered this:--yet still it was uttered with something of
a cervantick

 tone;--and as he spoke it, eugenius could perceive a stream
of lambent fire lighted up for a moment in his eyes;--faint picture of
those flashes of his spirit, which (as shakespeare said of his ancestor)
were wont to set the table in a roar!

eugenius was convinced from this, that the heart of his friend was
broke: he squeezed his hand,--and then walked softly out of the room,
weeping as he walked. yorick followed eugenius with his eyes to the
door,--he then closed them, and never opened them more.

he lies buried in the corner of his church-yard, in the parish of...,
under a plain marble slab, which his friend eugenius, by leave of his
executors, laid upon his grave, with no more than these three words of
inscription, serving both for his epitaph and elegy. alas, poor yorick!

ten times a day has yorick's ghost the consolation to hear his
monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones,

in--the neglect is inexcusable; and heaven is witness, how the world
has revenged itself upon me for leaving so many openings to equivocal
strictures--and for depending so much as i have done, all along, upon
the cleanliness of my readers imaginations.

--here are two senses, cried eugenius, as we walk'd along, pointing
with the fore finger of his right hand to the word crevice, in the one
hundred and seventy-eighth page of the first volume of this book of
books,--here are two senses--quoth he.--and here are two roads, replied
i, turning short upon him--a dirty and a clean one--which shall we
take?--the clean, by all means, replied eugenius. eugenius, said i,
stepping before him, and laying my hand upon his breast--to define--is
to distrust.--thus i triumph'd over eugenius; but i

chapter 2.lxiii.

--can you tell me, quoth phutatorius, speaking to gastripheres who
sat next to him--for one would not apply to a surgeon in so foolish
an affair--can you tell me, gastripheres, what is best to take out the
fire?--ask eugenius, said gastripheres.--that greatly depends, said
eugenius, pretending ignorance of the adventure, upon the nature of the
part--if it is a tender part, and a part which can conveniently be wrapt
up--it is both the one and the other, replied phutatorius, laying his
hand as he spoke, with an emphatical nod of his head, upon the part
in question, and lifting up his right leg at the same time to ease and
ventilate it.--if that is the case, said eugenius, i would advise you,
phutatorius, not to tamper

 with it by any means; but if you will send to
the next printer, and trust your cure to such a simple thing as a soft
sheet of paper just come off the press--you need do nothing more than
twist it round.--the damp paper, quoth yorick (who sat next to his
friend eugenius) though i know it has a refreshing coolness in it--yet
i presume is no more than the vehicle--and that the oil and
lamp-black with which the paper is so strongly impregnated, does the
business.--right, said eugenius, and is, of any outward application i
would venture to recommend, the most anodyne and safe.

was it my case, said gastripheres, as the main thing is the oil and
lamp-black, i should spread them thick upon a rag, and clap it on
directly.--that would make a very devil of it, replied yorick.--and
besides, added eugenius, it would not answer the intention, which is
the extreme neatness and elegance of the prescription, which the faculty
hold to be half in half;--for consider, if the type is a very

(which it should be) the sanative particles, which come into contact in
this form, have the advantage of being spread so infinitely thin, and
with such a mathematical equality (fresh paragraphs and large capitals
excepted) as no art or management of the spatula can come up to.--it
falls out very luckily, replied phutatorius, that the second edition
of my treatise de concubinis retinendis is at this instant in
the press.--you may take any leaf of it, said eugenius--no matter
which.--provided, quoth yorick, there is no bawdry in it.--

they are just now, replied phutatorius, printing off the ninth
chapter--which is the last chapter but one in the book.--pray what
is the title of that chapter? said yorick; making a respectful bow to
phutatorius as he spoke.--i think, answered phutatorius, 'tis that de re
concubinaria.

for heaven's sake keep out of that chapter, quoth yorick.

--by all means--added eugenius.

which case, supposing the issue a daughter, she would stand in relation
both of--but who ever thought, cried kysarcius, of laying with his
grandmother?--the young gentleman, replied yorick, whom selden speaks
of--who not only thought of it, but justified his intention to his
father by the argument drawn from the law of retaliation.--'you
laid, sir, with my mother,' said the lad--'why may not i lay with
yours?'--'tis the argumentum commune, added yorick.--'tis as good,
replied eugenius, taking down his hat, as they deserve.

the company broke up.

--and pray, said my uncle toby, leaning upon yorick, as he and my father
were helping him leisurely down the stairs--don't be terrified, madam,
this stair-case conversation is not so long as the last--and pray,
yorick, said my uncle toby, which way is this said affair of tristram
at length settled by these learned men? very satisfactorily, replied
yorick; no mortal, sir, has any concern with it--for mrs. shandy the

--let no man say from what taggs and jaggs hints may not be cut out for
the advancement of human knowledge. let no man, who has read my father's
first and second beds of justice, ever rise up and say again, from
collision of what kinds of bodies light may or may not be struck out, to
carry the arts and sciences up to perfection.--heaven! thou knowest how
i love them;--thou knowest the secrets of my heart, and that i would
this moment give my shirt--thou art a fool, shandy, says eugenius, for
thou hast but a dozen in the world,--and 'twill break thy set.--

no matter for that, eugenius; i would give the shirt off my back to be
burnt into tinder, were it only to satisfy one feverish enquirer, how
many sparks at one good stroke, a good flint and steel could strike
into the tail of it.--think ye not that in striking these in,--he might,
per-adventure, strike something out? as sure as a gun.--

--but this project, by the bye.

the corporal sat up the best part of the night, in brin

with sable, or with a sickly green; in dangers ye gilded my horizon with
hope, and when death himself knocked at my door--ye bad him come again;
and in so gay a tone of careless indifference, did ye do it, that he
doubted of his commission--

'--there must certainly be some mistake in this matter,' quoth he.

now there is nothing in this world i abominate worse, than to be
interrupted in a story--and i was that moment telling eugenius a most
tawdry one in my way, of a nun who fancied herself a shell-fish, and of
a monk damn'd for eating a muscle, and was shewing him the grounds and
justice of the procedure--

'--did ever so grave a personage get into so vile a scrape?' quoth
death. thou hast had a narrow escape, tristram, said eugenius, taking
hold of my hand as i finished my story--

but there is no living, eugenius, replied i, at this rate; for as this
son of a whore has found out my lodgings--

to write, and forty thousand things to say and do which no body in the
world will say and do for me, except thyself; and as thou seest he has
got me by the throat (for eugenius could scarce hear me speak across
the table), and that i am no match for him in the open field, had i not
better, whilst these few scatter'd spirits remain, and these two spider
legs of mine (holding one of them up to him) are able to support
me--had i not better, eugenius, fly for my life? 'tis my advice, my
dear tristram, said eugenius--then by heaven! i will lead him a dance
he little thinks of--for i will gallop, quoth i, without looking once
behind me, to the banks of the garonne; and if i

--he runs more risk there, said eugenius, than thou.

eugenius's wit and affection brought blood into the cheek from whence it
had been some months banish'd--'twas a vile moment to bid adieu in; he
led me to my chaise--allons! said i; the post-boy gave a crack with
his whip--off i went like a cannon, and in half a dozen bounds got into
dover.

planting his cabbages one by one, in straight lines, and stoical
distances, especially if slits in petticoats are unsew'd up--without
ever and anon straddling out, or sidling into some bastardly
digression--in freeze-land, fog-land, and some other lands i wot of--it
may be done--

but in this clear climate of fantasy and perspiration, where every idea,
sensible and insensible, gets vent--in this land, my dear eugenius--in
this fertile land of chivalry and romance, where i now sit, unskrewing
my ink-horn to write my uncle toby's amours, and with all the meanders
of julia's track in quest of her diego, in full view of my study
window--if thou comest not and takest me by the hand--

what a work it is likely to turn out!

let us begin it.

o ye water drinkers! is it then by this delusive fountain, that ye
have so often governed and turn'd this world about like a
mill-wheel--grinding the faces of the impotent--bepowdering their
ribs--bepeppering their noses, and changing sometimes even the very
frame and face of nature--

if i was you, quoth yorick, i would drink more water, eugenius--and, if
i was you, yorick, replied eugenius, so would i.

which shews they had both read longinus--

for my own part, i am resolved never to read any book but my own, as
long as i live.

i wish my uncle toby had been a water-drinker; for then the thing had
been accounted for, that the first moment widow wadman saw him, she felt
something stirring within her in his favour--something!--something.
