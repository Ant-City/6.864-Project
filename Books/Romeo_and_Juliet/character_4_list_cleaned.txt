the [CHARACTER] - 
                juliet's
[CHARACTER], the woman who breast-fed juliet when she was a baby and has
cared for juliet her entire life. a vulgar, long-winded, and sentimental
character, the [CHARACTER] provides comic relief with her frequently inappropriate
remarks and speeches. but, until a disagreement near the play's
end, the [CHARACTER] is juliet's faithful confidante and loyal intermediary
in juliet's affair with romeo. she provides a contrast with juliet, given
that her view of love is earthy and sexual, whereas juliet is idealistic
and intense. the [CHARACTER] believes in love and wants juliet to have
a nice-looking husband, but the idea that juliet would want to sacrifice
herself for love is incomprehensible to her.
