ements, and new works, all which he would read with that
intense application and delight, that he would forget himself, his
wound, his confinement, his dinner.

in the second year my uncle toby purchased ramelli and cataneo,
translated from the italian;--likewise stevinus, moralis, the chevalier
de ville, lorini, cochorn, sheeter, the count de pagan, the marshal
vauban, mons. blondel, with almost as many more books of military
architecture, as don quixote was found to have of chivalry, when the
curate and barber invaded his library.

towards the beginning of the third year, which was in august,
ninety-nine, my uncle toby found it necessary to understand a little of
projectiles:--and having judged it best to draw his knowledge from the
fountain-head, he began with n. tartaglia, who it seems was the first
man who detected the imposition of a cannon-ball's doing all that
mischief under the notion of a right line--this n. tartaglia proved to
my uncle toby to be an impossible thing.

--then reach me my breeches off the chair, said my father to
susannah.--there is not a moment's time to dress you, sir, cried
susannah--the child is as black in the face as my--as your what? said
my father, for like all orators, he was a dear searcher into
comparisons.--bless, me, sir, said susannah, the child's in a fit.--and
where's mr. yorick?--never where he should be, said susannah, but his
curate's in the dressing-room, with the child upon his arm, waiting
for the name--and my mistress bid me run as fast as i could to know, as
captain shandy is the godfather, whether it should not be called after
him.

were one sure, said my father to himself, scratching his eye-brow, that
the child was expiring, one might as well compliment my brother toby as
not--and it would be a pity, in such a case, to throw away so great a
name as trismegistus upon him--but he may recover.

no, no,--said my father

ah, added my father;
canst thou carry trismegistus in thy head, the length of the gallery
without scattering?--can i? cried susannah, shutting the door in a
huff.--if she can, i'll be shot, said my father, bouncing out of bed in
the dark, and groping for his breeches.

susannah ran with all speed along the gallery.

my father made all possible speed to find his breeches.

susannah got the start, and kept it--'tis tris--something, cried
susannah--there is no christian-name in the world, said the curate,
beginning with tris--but tristram. then 'tis tristram-gistus, quoth
susannah.

--there is no gistus to it, noodle!--'tis my own name, replied the
curate, dipping his hand, as he spoke, into the bason--tristram! said
he, &c. &c. &c. &c.--so tristram was i called, and tristram shall i be
to the day of my death.

my father followed susannah, with his night-gown across his arm, with
nothing more than his breeches on, fastened through haste with but a
single button, and that button through haste th

--she has not forgot the name, cried my father, half opening the
door?--no, no, said the curate, with a tone of intelligence.--and the
child is better, cried susannah.--and how does your mistress? as well,
said susannah, as can be expected.--pish! said my father, the button
of his breeches slipping out of the button-hole--so that whether the
interjection was levelled at susannah, or the button-hole--whether pish
was an interjection of contempt or an interjection of modesty, is a
doubt, and must be a doubt till i shall have time to write the three
following favourite chapters, that is, my

your honour, said trim, shutting the parlour-door before he began to
speak, has heard, i imagine, of this unlucky accident--o yes, trim, said
my uncle toby, and it gives me great concern.--i am heartily concerned
too, but i hope your honour, replied trim, will do me the justice
to believe, that it was not in the least owing to me.--to
thee--trim?--cried my uncle toby, looking kindly in his face--'twas
susannah's and the curate's folly betwixt them.--what business could
they have together, an' please your honour, in the garden?--in the
gallery thou meanest, replied my uncle toby.

trim found he was upon a wrong scent, and stopped short with a low
bow--two misfortunes, quoth the corporal to himself, are twice as many
at least as are needful to be talked over at one time;--the mischief the
cow has done in breaking into the fortifications, may be told his honour
hereafter.--trim's casuistry and address, under the cover o

was plain to the whole court the word was ruined: la fosseuse had
given it a wound, and it was not the better for passing through all
these defiles--it made a faint stand, however, for a few months, by the
expiration of which, the sieur de croix, finding it high time to leave
navarre for want of whiskers--the word in course became indecent, and
(after a few efforts) absolutely unfit for use.

the best word, in the best language of the best world, must have
suffered under such combinations.--the curate of d'estella wrote a book
against them, setting forth the dangers of accessory ideas, and warning
the navarois against them.

does not all the world know, said the curate d'estella at the conclusion
of his work, that noses ran the same fate some centuries ago in
most parts of europe, which whiskers have now done in the kingdom of
navarre?--the evil indeed spread no farther then--but have not beds
and bolsters, and night-caps and chamber-pots stood upon the brink
of destruction ever since? are n

the drift of the curate d'estella's argument was not understood.--they
ran the scent the wrong way.--the world bridled his ass at the
tail.--and when the extremes of delicacy, and the beginnings of
concupiscence, hold their next provincial chapter together, they may
decree that bawdy also.



chapter 3.ii.

when my father received the letter which brought him the melancholy
account of my brother bobby's death, he was busy calculating the expence
of his riding post from calais to paris, and so on to lyons.

in shandy's servant, and that your honour
(though a stranger) was extremely concerned for his father;--and that
if there was any thing in your house or cellar--(and thou might'st have
added my purse too, said my uncle toby),--he was heartily welcome to
it:--he made a very low bow (which was meant to your honour), but no
answer--for his heart was full--so he went up stairs with the toast;--i
warrant you, my dear, said i, as i opened the kitchen-door, your father
will be well again.--mr. yorick's curate was smoking a pipe by the
kitchen fire,--but said not a word good or bad to comfort the youth.--i
thought it wrong; added the corporal--i think so too, said my uncle
toby.

when the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast, he felt
himself a little revived, and sent down into the kitchen, to let me
know, that in about ten minutes he should be glad if i would step
up stairs.--i believe, said the landlord, he is going to say his
prayers,--for there was a book laid upon the chair by his be

as i shut the door, i saw his son take up a cushion.--

i thought, said the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, mr. trim,
never said your prayers at all.--i heard the poor gentleman say his
prayers last night, said the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own
ears, or i could not have believed it.--are you sure of it? replied the
curate.--a soldier, an' please your reverence, said i, prays as often
(of his own accord) as a parson;--and when he is fighting for his king,
and for his own life, and for his honour too, he has the most reason
to pray to god of any one in the whole world--'twas well said of thee,
trim, said my uncle toby.--but when a soldier, said i, an' please your
reverence, has been standing for twelve hours together in the trenches,
up to his knees in cold water,--or engaged, said i, for months

the young fellow utter'd this with an accent and a look so perfectly in
tune to a feeling heart, that i instantly made a vow, i would give him a

--and who is poor maria? said i.

the love and piety of all the villages around us; said the
postillion--it is but three years ago, that the sun did not shine upon
so fair, so quick-witted and amiable a maid; and better fate did maria
deserve, than to have her banns forbid, by the intrigues of the curate
of the parish who published them--

he was going on, when maria, who had made a short pause, put the pipe to
her mouth, and began the air again--they were the same notes;--yet were
ten times sweeter: it is the evening service to the virgin, said the
young man--but who has taught her to play it--or how she came by her
pipe, no one knows; we think that heaven has assisted her in both;
for ever since she has been unsettled in her mind, it seems her only
consolation--she has never once had the pipe
