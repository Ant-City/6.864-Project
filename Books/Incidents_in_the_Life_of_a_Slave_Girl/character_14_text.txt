come back again? may be he'll find mother. if he does, won't she be glad to see him! why don't you and uncle phillip, and all of us, go and live where mother is? i should like it; wouldn't you, ellen?"

        "yes, i should like it," replied ellen; "but how could we find her? do you know the place, grandmother? i don't remember how mother lookedâ€”do you, benny?"

        benny was just beginning to describe me when they were interrupted by an old slave woman, a near neighbor,

named aggie. this poor creature had witnessed the sale of her children, and seen them carried off to parts unknown, without any hopes of ever hearing from them again. she saw that my grandmother had been weeping, and she said, in a sympathizing tone, "what's the matter, aunt marthy?"

        "o aggie," she replied, "it seems as if i shouldn't have any of my children or grandchildren left to hand me a drink when i'm dying, and lay my old body in the ground. my boy didn't come back with mr. sands. he staid

at the north."

        poor old aggie clapped her hands for joy. "is dat what you's crying fur?" she exclaimed. "git down on your knees and bress de lord! i don't know whar my poor chillern is, and i nebber 'spect to know. you don't know whar poor linda's gone to; but you do know whar her brudder is. he's in free parts; and dat's de right place. don't murmur at de lord's doings, but git down on your knees and tank him for his goodness."

        my selfishness was rebuked by what poor aggie said. she rejoiced over the escape of one who was merely her fellow-bondman, while his own sister was only thinking what his good fortune might cost her children. i knelt and prayed god to forgive me; and i thanked him from my heart, that one of my family was saved from the grasp of slavery.

        it was not long before we received a letter from william. he wrote that mr. sands had always treated him kindly, and that he had tried to do his duty to him faithfully. but ever since he was a boy,

d the trust. aggie little dreamed that my grandmother knew where her daughter was concealed, and that the stooping form of her old neighbor was bending under a similar burden of anxiety and fear; but these dangerous secrets deepened the sympathy between the two old persecuted mothers.

        my friend fanny and i remained many weeks hidden within call of each other; but she was unconscious of the fact. i longed to have her share my den, which seemed a more secure retreat than her own; but i had brought so much

 was apprised of this, he was disappointed and vexed. he said, that judging from our past experience, it would be a long time before i has such another chance to throw away. i told him it need not be thrown away; that i had a friend concealed near by, who would be glad enough to take to the place that had been provided for me. i told him about poor fanny, and the kind-hearted, noble fellow, who never turned his back upon any body in distress, white or black, expressed his readiness to help her. aggie was much surprised when she found that we knew her secret. she was rejoiced to hear of such a chance for fanny,

and arrangements were made for her to go on board the vessel the next night. they both supposed that i had long been at the north, therefore my name was not mentioned in the transaction. fanny was carried on board at the appointed time, and stowed away in a very small cabin. this accommodation had been purchased at a price that would pay for a voyage to england. but when one
