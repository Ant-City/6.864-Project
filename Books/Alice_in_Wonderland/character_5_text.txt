u!’ but she went on all the same, shedding gallons of
tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall.

after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. it was the white
rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in
one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great
hurry, muttering to himself as he came, ‘oh! the duchess, the duchess!
oh! won’t she be savage if i’ve kept her waiting!’ alice felt so
desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the rabbit
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, ‘if you please, sir--’
the rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan,
and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: ‘dear,

oor alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. in a little while, however, she again heard
a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
back to finish his story.




chapter iv. the rabbit sends in a little bill

it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself ‘the duchess! the duchess! oh my dear paws! oh
my fur and whiskers! she’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! where can i have dropped them, i wonder?’ alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in
the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,
had vanished completely.

 rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. it was opened
by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all
over their heads. she felt very curious to know what it was all about,
and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

the fish-footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, ‘for the duchess. an invitation from the queen
to play croquet.’ the frog-footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,
only changing the order of the words a little, ‘from the queen. an
invitation for the duchess to play croquet.’

then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the
wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
fish-footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, s

tman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. ‘i shall sit here,’ he said, ‘on and off, for
days and days.’

‘but what am i to do?’ said alice.

‘anything you like,’ said the footman, and began whistling.

‘oh, there’s no use in talking to him,’ said alice desperately: ‘he’s
perfectly idiotic!’ and she opened the door and went in.

the door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in
the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring
a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

‘there’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!’ alice said to herself,
as well as she could for sneezing.

there was certainly too much of it in the air. even the duchess
sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment’s pause. the only things in the kitchen
that did not sn

eeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

‘please would you tell me,’ said alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, ‘why
your cat grins like that?’

‘it’s a cheshire cat,’ said the duchess, ‘and that’s why. pig!’

she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--

‘i didn’t know that cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, i didn’t know
that cats could grin.’

‘they all can,’ said the duchess; ‘and most of ‘em do.’

‘i don’t know of any that do,’ alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got i

nto a conversation.

‘you don’t know much,’ said the duchess; ‘and that’s a fact.’

alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. while she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. the duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

‘oh, please mind what you’re doing!’ cried alice, jumping up and down in
an agony of terror. ‘oh, there goes his precious nose’; as an unusually
large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.

‘if everybody minded their own business,’ the duchess said in a hoarse
growl, ‘the world would go round a deal f

aster than it does.’

‘which would not be an advantage,’ said alice, who felt very glad to get
an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. ‘just think of
what work it would make with the day and night! you see the earth takes
twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--’

‘talking of axes,’ said the duchess, ‘chop off her head!’

alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: ‘twenty-four hours, i think; or is
it twelve? i--’

‘oh, don’t bother me,’ said the duchess; ‘i never could abide figures!’
and with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of
every line:

 ‘speak roughly to your little boy,
    and beat him when he sneezes:
   he only does it to annoy,
    because he knows it teases.’

         chorus.

 (in which the cook and the baby joined):--

       ‘wow! wow! wow!’

while the duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that alice could hardly hear the words:--

   ‘i speak severely to my boy,
    i beat him when he sneezes;
   for he can thoroughly enjoy
    the pepper when he pleases!’

         chorus.

       ‘wow! wow! wow!’

‘here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!’ the duchess said to alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. ‘i must go and get ready to play

‘that’s right!’ shouted the queen. ‘can you play croquet?’

the soldiers were silent, and looked at alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.

‘yes!’ shouted alice.

‘come on, then!’ roared the queen, and alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

‘it’s--it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side. she was
walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

‘very,’ said alice: ‘--where’s the duchess?’

‘hush! hush!’ said the rabbit in a low, hurried tone. he looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered ‘she’s under
sentence of execution.’

‘what for?’ said alice.

‘did you say “what a pity!”?’ the rabbit asked.

‘no, i didn’t,’ said alice: ‘i don’t think it’s at all a pity. i said
“what for?”’

‘she boxed the queen’s ears--’ the rabbit began. alice gave a li

 he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life.

the king’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.

the queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less
than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (it was this last
remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)

alice could think of nothing else to say but ‘it belongs to the duchess:
you’d better ask her about it.’

‘she’s in prison,’ the queen said to the executioner: ‘fetch her here.’
and the executioner went off like an arrow.

 the cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
by the time he had come back with the duchess, it had entirely
disappeared; so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down
looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.




chapter ix. the mock turtle’s story

‘you can’t think how gla

d i am to see you again, you dear old thing!’
said the duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice’s, and
they walked off together.

alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

‘when i’m a duchess,’ she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
though), ‘i won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. soup does very
well without--maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,’
she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of
rule, ‘and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes
them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. i only wish people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so
stingy about it, you

 know--’

she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. ‘you’re thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. i can’t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but i shall remember it in
a bit.’

‘perhaps it hasn’t one,’ alice ventured to remark.

‘tut, tut, child!’ said the duchess. ‘everything’s got a moral, if only
you can find it.’ and she squeezed herself up closer to alice’s side as
she spoke.

alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon alice’s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. however, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

‘the game’s going on rather better now,’ she said, by way of

keeping up
the conversation a little.

‘’tis so,’ said the duchess: ‘and the moral of that is--“oh, ‘tis love,
‘tis love, that makes the world go round!”’

‘somebody said,’ alice whispered, ‘that it’s done by everybody minding
their own business!’

‘ah, well! it means much the same thing,’ said the duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into alice’s shoulder as she added, ‘and the moral
of that is--“take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.”’

‘how fond she is of finding morals in things!’ alice thought to herself.

‘i dare say you’re wondering why i don’t put my arm round your waist,’
the duchess said after a pause: ‘the reason is, that i’m doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. shall i try the experiment?’

‘he might bite,’ alice c

autiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to
have the experiment tried.

‘very true,’ said the duchess: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite. and
the moral of that is--“birds of a feather flock together.”’

‘only mustard isn’t a bird,’ alice remarked.

‘right, as usual,’ said the duchess: ‘what a clear way you have of
putting things!’

‘it’s a mineral, i think,’ said alice.

‘of course it is,’ said the duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that alice said; ‘there’s a large mustard-mine near here. and
the moral of that is--“the more there is of mine, the less there is of
yours.”’

‘oh, i know!’ exclaimed alice, who had not attended to this last remark,
‘it’s a vegetable. it doesn’t look like one, but it is.’

‘i quite agree with you,’ said the duchess; ‘and the moral of that
is--“be what you would seem to be”--or if you’d like it put more
simply--“never i

magine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.”’

‘i think i should understand that better,’ alice said very politely, ‘if
i had it written down: but i can’t quite follow it as you say it.’

‘that’s nothing to what i could say if i chose,’ the duchess replied, in
a pleased tone.

‘pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,’ said
alice.

‘oh, don’t talk about trouble!’ said the duchess. ‘i make you a present
of everything i’ve said as yet.’

‘a cheap sort of present!’ thought alice. ‘i’m glad they don’t give
birthday presents like that!’ but she did not venture to say it out
loud.

‘thinking again?’ the duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

‘i’ve a right to think,’

said alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

‘just about as much right,’ said the duchess, ‘as pigs have to fly; and
the m--’

but here, to alice’s great surprise, the duchess’s voice died away, even
in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked
into hers began to tremble. alice looked up, and there stood the queen
in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.

‘a fine day, your majesty!’ the duchess began in a low, weak voice.

‘now, i give you fair warning,’ shouted the queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; ‘either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! take your choice!’

the duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

‘let’s go on with the game,’ the queen said to alice; and alice was
too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

the other guests had taken advantage of the queen’s absence, and

‘i’d rather finish my tea,’ said the hatter, with an anxious look at the
queen, who was reading the list of singers.

‘you may go,’ said the king, and the hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

‘--and just take his head off outside,’ the queen added to one of the
officers: but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

‘call the next witness!’ said the king.

the next witness was the duchess’s cook. she carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

‘give your evidence,’ said the king.

‘shan’t,’ said the cook.

the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit, who said in a low voice,
‘your majesty must cross-examine this witness.’

‘well, if i must, i must,’ the king said, with a melancholy air, and,

istened, or seemed to
listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
of her little sister’s dream.

the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by--the
frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the
lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock
turtle.

so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the wav
