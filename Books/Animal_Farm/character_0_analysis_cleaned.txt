[CHARACTER]
from the very beginning of the novella, [CHARACTER] emerges
as an utterly corrupt opportunist. though always present at the
early meetings of the new state, [CHARACTER] never makes a single contribution
to the revolution--not to the formulation of its ideology, not to the
bloody struggle that it necessitates, not to the new society's initial
attempts to establish itself. he never shows interest in the strength
of animal farm itself, only in the strength of his power over it.
thus, the only project he undertakes with enthusiasm is the training
of a litter of puppies. he doesn't educate them for their own good
or for the good of all, however, but rather for his own good: they
become his own private army or secret police, a violent means by
which he imposes his will on others.

although he is most directly modeled on the soviet dictator joseph
stalin, [CHARACTER] represents, in a more general sense, the political
tyrants that have emerged throughout human history and with particular
frequency during the twentieth century. his namesake is not any
communist leader but the early-eighteenth-century french general
[CHARACTER], who betrayed the democratic principles on which he rode
to power, arguably becoming as great a despot as the aristocrats
whom he supplanted. it is a testament to orwell's acute political
intelligence and to the universality of his fable that [CHARACTER]
can easily stand for any of the great dictators and political schemers
in world history, even those who arose after animal farm was
written. in the behavior of [CHARACTER] and his henchmen, one can detect
the lying and bullying tactics of totalitarian leaders such as josip
tito, mao tse-tung, pol pot, augusto pinochet, and slobodan milosevic
treated in sharply critical terms.
