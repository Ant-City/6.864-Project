i  spent  the  next  mile  in  deep  worry.  i  had  no  
plan,  no  prospects  of  a  plan.  until  now  i'd  mostly

rosaleen, on the other hand, was out here biding 
time till we got caught. counting it as summer vacation 
from  jail.  what  i  needed  was  a  sign.  i  needed  a  voice

those?"

really consternation.
