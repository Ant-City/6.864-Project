  gloucester. now is the winter of our discontent
    made glorious summer by this sun of york;
    and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
    in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
    now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
    our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
    our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,
    our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
    grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,
    and now, instead

    that waits upon your grace?
  clarence. his majesty,
    tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed
    this conduct to convey me to th' tower.
  gloucester. upon what cause?
  clarence. because my name is george.
  gloucester. alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:
    he should, for that, commit your godfathers.
    o, belike his majesty hath some intent
    that you should be new-christ'ned in the tower.
    but what's the matter, clarence? may i know?
  clarence. yea, richard, when i know; for i protest
    as yet i do not; but, as i can learn,
    he hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
    and from the cross-row plucks the letter g,
    and says a wizard told him that by g
    his issue disinherited should be;
    and, for my name of george begins with g,
    it follows in his thought that i am he.
    these, as i learn, and such like toys as these
    hath mov'd his highness to commit me now.
  gloucester. why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:

  queen elizabeth. if he were dead, what would betide on
    me?
  grey. no other harm but loss of such a lord.
  queen elizabeth. the loss of such a lord includes all
    harms.
  grey. the heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
    to be your comforter when he is gone.
  queen elizabeth. ah, he is young; and his minority
    is put unto the trust of richard gloucester,
    a man that loves not me, nor none of you.
  river. is it concluded he shall be protector?
  queen elizabeth. it is determin'd, not concluded yet;
    but so it must be, if the king miscarry.
