Duchess - 
      Wife of Gloucester, the Duchess is very ambitious and wants Gloucester to desire the throne as much as she does. She hires practitioners of the occult to help her find out about the future of Henry's kingdom so she can figure out how to position herself to gain the most power. When she is caught, she is banished after being led through the streets of London. Her fall spells the end for Gloucester.
