factories stained with tar, high-perched water-tanks, big red trucks
like locomotives, and, on a score of hectic side-tracks, far-wandering
freight-cars from the new york central and apple orchards, the great
northern and wheat-plateaus, the southern pacific and orange groves.

they talked to the secretary of the zenith foundry company about
an interesting artistic project--a cast-iron fence for linden lane
cemetery. they drove on to the zeeco motor company and interviewed
the sales-manager, noel ryland, about a discount on a zeeco car for
thompson. babbitt and ryland were fellow-members of the boosters' club,
and no booster felt right if he bought anything from another booster
without receiving a discount. but henry thompson growled, "oh, t' hell
with 'em! i'm not going to crawl around mooching discounts, not
from nobody." it was one of the differences between thompson, the
old-fashioned, lean yankee, rugged, traditional, stage type of
american business man, and babbitt, the plump, smooth, ef

ted provincialism as any proper englishman by any
american. he knew himself to be of a breeding altogether more esthetic
and sensitive than thompson's. he was a college graduate, he played
golf, he often smoked cigarettes instead of cigars, and when he went
to chicago he took a room with a private bath. "the whole thing is," he

that great department-store, the state university. ryland wore spats,
he wrote long letters about city planning and community singing, and,
though he was a booster, he was known to carry in his pocket small
volumes of poetry in a foreign language. all this was going too far.
henry thompson was the extreme of insularity, and noel ryland the
extreme of frothiness, while between the

with this just estimate of himself--and with the promise of a discount
on thompson's car--he returned to his office in triumph.

but as he went through the corridor of the reeves building he sighed,
"poor old paul! i got to--oh, damn noel ryland! damn charley mckelvey!
just because they make more money than i do, they think they're so
superior. i wouldn't be found dead in their stuffy old union club!
i--somehow, to-day, i don't feel like going back to work. oh well--"

he answered telephone calls, he read the four o'clock mail, he signed
his morning's letters, he talked to a tenant about repairs, he fought
with stanley graff.

young graff, the outside salesman, was always hinting that he deserved
an increase of commission, and to-
