Jokanaan  - 
      Jokanaan--Wilde's Saint John the Baptist--is the prophet imprisoned in a tomb-like cistern at the orders of the Tetrarch. "Terrible to look at", he spends much of the play in his subterranean prison, figuring as a mad, booming voice that prophecies the ruin of the kingdom, curses the royal family, and proclaims the coming of Christ. He appears on-stage and takes corporeal form, against his wishes, at Salome's lustful call. As a mystic, Jokanaan is a tabooed body: Herod bans others from seeing him, and he himself--as Salome learns--refuses to suffer the gaze of the cursed. He is also "blind" in a sense, failing to see those around him in his inspiration by the divine word.
