self," she said, and for some 
reason this stirred up the current that had moved in my 
limbs  when i'd  first  entered the  room.  "all  right,  then. 
rosaleen can help may  in the house, and  you can help 
me and zach with the bees. zach is my main helper, so i 
can't pay you anything, but at least you'll have a room 
and some food till we call your aunt and see about her 
sending some bus money."

"i  don't  exactly  know  her  whole  name,"  i  said.  
"my father just called her aunt bernie; i never met her." 
"well,  what  were  you  planning  to  do,  child,  go 

door to door in virginia?" 

"no, ma'am, just richmond." 
"i see," said august. and the thing was, she did. 

she saw right through it.

that  afternoon,  heat  built  up  in  the  skies  over 
tiburon; finally it gave  way to  a thunderstorm. august, 
rosaleen, and i stood on the screen porch that jutted off 
the  back  of  the  kitchen  and  watched  the  clouds  bruise 
dark  purple  over  the  treetop

the first week at august's was a consolation. 
the  world  will  give  you  that  once  in  a  while,  a  
brief time out; the boxing bell rings and you go to your 
corner,  where  somebody  dabs  mercy  on  your  beat-up 
life. 

all  that  week  no  one  brought  up  my  father, 
supposedly  dead  in  a  tractor  accident,  or  my  long-lost 
aunt bernie in virginia. the calendar sisters just took us 
in. 

the  first  thing  they  did  was  take  care  of  

rosaleen's clothes. 

august  got  into  her  truck  and  went  straight  to 
the amen dollar store, where she bought rosaleen four

waistless, hawaiian-looking dresses, and a bra that could 
have slung boulders. 

"this  ain't  charity,"  said  rosaleen  when  august 
spread this, across the kitchen table. "i'll pay

already,  so  i  had  to  wonder  what  kind  of  educational 
requirements  they  had  for  policemen  in  tiburon.  it 
looked like the same ones as sylvan. 

he  drew  up  even  taller.  "well,  what  i  don't 
understand  is,  if  you're  going  to  live  with  your  aunt  in 
virginia, what are you doing here?"

here is the translation: i am completely confused 
what  a  white  girl  like  you  is  doing  staying  in  a  colored  
house. 

i took a breath. "well, see, my aunt bernie had to 
have  an  operation.  it  was  female  trouble.  so  rosaleen 
over  there  said,  "why  don't  me  and  you  stay  with  my  
friend august boatwright in tiburon till aunt bernie gets 
on her feet again?"' it was no sense in us going up there 
while she was in the hospital." 

he  was  actually  writing  this  down.  why?  i 
wanted to yell at him, this is not about me and rosaleen 
and  aunt  bernie's  operation.  this  is  about  may.  she  is 
dead,  or  haven't  you  noticed?  i  s

ight then crying my eyeballs out, and here i was 
having the stupidest conversation of my life. 

"didn't  you  have  any  white  people  back  in 

spartanburg you could stay with?" 

translation:  anything  would  be  better  than  you 

staying in a colored house. 

"no,  sir,  not  really.  i  didn't  have  that  many  
friends. for some reason i didn't fit in that well with the 
crowd.  i  think  it  was  cause  i  made  such  good  grades.  
one lady at church said i could stay there till aunt bernie 
got  well,  but  then  she  got  shingles,  and  there  went 
that." 

lord god, somebody stop me.

he  looked  at  rosaleen.  "so  how  did  you  know 
august?" i held my breath, aware that my rocking chair 
had come to a standstill. 

"she's my husband's first cousin," rosaleen said. 
"me and her kept up after my husband left me. august 
was the only one of his family who knew what a sorry 
jackass he was." she cut her eyes at me as if to say, see? 
you aren't the only one who can
