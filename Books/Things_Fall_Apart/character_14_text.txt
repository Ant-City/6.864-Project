d cursed him.



mr. brown preached against such excess of zeal. everything was
possible, he told his energetic flock, but everything was not
expedient. and so mr. brown came to be respected even by the
clan, because he trod softly on its faith. he made friends with some
of the great men of the clan and on one of his frequent visits to the
neighboring villages he had been presented with a carved elephant
tusk, which was a sign of dignity and rank. one of the great men in
that village was called akunna and he had given one of his sons to
be taught the white man's knowledge in mr. brown's school.

whenever mr. brown went to that village he spent long hours with
akunna in his obi talking through an interpreter about religion.
neither of them succeeded in converting the other but they learned
more about their different beliefs.

"you say that there is one supreme god who made heaven and
earth," said akunna on one of mr. brown's visits. "we also believe
in him and call him chukwu. he made all the

 world and the other
gods."

"there are no other gods," said mr. brown. "chukwu is the only
god and all others are false. you carve a piece of wood—like that
one" (he pointed at the rafters from which akunna's carved ikenga
hung), "and you call it a god. but it is still a piece of wood."

"yes," said akunna. "it is indeed a piece of wood. the tree from
which it came was made by chukwu, as indeed all minor gods
were. but he made them for his messengers so that we could
approach him through them. it is like yourself. you are the head of
your church."

"no," protested mr. brown. "the head of my church is god
himself."



"i know," said akunna, "but there must be a head in this world
among men. somebody like yourself must be the head here."



"the head of my church in that sense is in england."

 to pay greater attention to the little gods but that
is not so. we worry them more because we are afraid to worry
their master. our fathers knew that chukwu was the overlord and
that is why many of them gave their children the name
chukwuka—"chukwu is supreme."



"you said one interesting thing," said mr. brown. "you are afraid
of chukwu. in my religion chukwu is a loving father and need not
be feared by those who do his will."



"but we must fear him when we are not doing his will," said
akunna. "and who is to tell his will? it is too great to be known."

in this way mr. brown learned a good deal about the religion of
the clan and he came to the conclusion that a frontal attack on it
would not succeed. and so he built a school and a little hospital in
umuofia. he went from family to family begging people to send
their children to his school. but at first they only sent their slaves
or sometimes their lazy children. mr. brown begged and argued
and prophesied. he said that the leaders o
