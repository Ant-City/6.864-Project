above, all the boxes were full. there was not an empty seat except in the president's box. when he came in the fight
would start. across the smooth sand, in the high doorway that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing,
their arms furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in across the arena. brett was watching them
with the glasses.
"here, would you like to look?"

i  looked through  the  glasses  and  saw the  three matadors.  romero  was in the  centre,  belmonte on  his left,

marcial on his right. back of them were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway and in
the open space of the corral, i saw the picadors. romero was wearing a black suit. his tricornered hat was low down
over his eyes. i could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly marked. he was looking straight
ahead. marcial was smoking a cigarette guardedly, holding it in his hand. beimonte looked ahead, his face wan and
yellow,  his  long  wolf

 jaw  out.  he  was  looking  at  nothing.  neither  he  nor  romero  seemed  to  have  anything  in
common with the others. they were all alone. the president came in; there was handclapping above us in the grand
stand, and i handed the glasses to brett. there was applause. the music started. brett looked through the glasses.
"here, take them," she said.


through the glasses i saw belmonte speak to romero. marcial straightened up and dropped his cigarette, and,
looking  straight  ahead,  their  heads  back,  their  free  arms  swinging,  the  three  matadors  walked  out.  behind  them
came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging,



"spread it out in front of you," i said.
brett  leaned  forward.  the  cape  was  heavy  and  smoothly  stiff  with  gold.  the  sword-handler  looked  back,

  to  the  sword-handler.  close  below  us  we  saw  romero's  lips  were  puffed,  both  eyes  were
discolored. his face was discolored and swollen. the sword-handler took the cape, looked up at brett, and came
over to us and handed up the cape.


shook his head, and said something. a man beside me leaned over toward brett.
"he doesn't want you to spread it," he said. "you should fold it and keep it in your lap."

brett folded the heavy cape.


romero did not look up at us. he was speaking to belmonte. belmonte had sent his formal cape over to some
friends. he looked across at them and smiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth. romero leaned over the
barrera and asked for the water-jug. the sword-handler brought it and romero poured water over the percale of his
fighting-cape, and then scuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot.
"what's that for?" brett asked.

"to give it weight in the wind."

"his face looks bad," bill said.

"he feels very badly," brett said. "h

e should be in bed."

the first bull was belmonte's. belmonte was very good. but because he got thirty thousand pesetas and people

had stayed in line all night to buy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than very good.
belmonte's great attraction is working close to the bull. in bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the
terrain of the bull-fighter. as long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe. each time he
enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger. belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the
bull. this way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy. people went to the corrida to see belmonte, to be given
tragic  sensations,  and  perhaps

  to  see  the  death  of  belmonte.  fifteen  years  ago  they  said  if  you  wanted  to  see
belmonte you should go quickly, while he was still alive. since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls. when
he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been, and when he came out of retirement the public
were disappointed because no real man could work as close to the bulls as belmonte was supposed to have done,
not, of course, even belmonte.

also belmonte imposed conditions and  insisted that his bulls should not be too large, nor too dangerously
armed with horns, and so the element that was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and the
public, who wanted three times as much from belmonte, who was sick with a fistula, as belmonte had ever been
able  to  give,  felt  defrauded  and  cheated,  and  belmonte's  jaw  came  further  out  in  contempt,  and  his  face  turned
yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pa

luted the president with the same wolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the barrera
to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into the callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his
head on his arms, not seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain. when he looked up, finally, he




asked for a drink of water. he swallowed a little, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back into
the ring.

because they were against belmonte the public were for romero. from the moment he left the barrera and
went toward the bull they applauded him. belmonte watched romero, too, watched him always without seeming to.
he paid no attention to marcial. marcial was the sort of thing he knew all about. he had come out of retirement to
compete with marcial, knowing it was a competition gained in advance. he had expected to compete with marcial
and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he knew that the sincerity of his own

 bull-fighting would
be so set off by the false aesthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he would only have to be in the
ring. his return from retirement had been spoiled by romero. romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully,
what he, belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes. the crowd felt it, even the people from biarritz,
even the american ambassador saw it, finally. it was a competition that belmonte would not enter because it would
lead  only  to  a  bad  horn  wound  or  death.  belmonte  was  no  longer  well  enough.  he  no  longer  had  his  greatest
moments in the bull-ring. he was not sure that there were any great moments. things were not the same and now
life only came in flashes. he had flashes of the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he
had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for their safety, getting out of a motor and lean

 watching, saw the bull start to turn his head. he did not want to charge. romero flicked his cape so the
color caught the bull's eye. the bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not the flash of color but a white
horse, and a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on
the bull's shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into
the bull's shoulder, making him bleed for belmonte.

the bull did not insist under the iron. he did not really want to get at the horse. he turned and the group broke
apart and romero was taking him out with his cape. he took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and,
standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. the bull's tail went up and he charged, and romero
moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. the dampened, mud-weighted cape swung open and
full as a sail fills, and romero pivoted with it jus

see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, romero had to make the bull consent with his body.
he had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and would start for it, and then shift the bull's charge to the flannel
and finish out the pass in the classic manner. the biarritz crowd did not like it. they thought romero was afraid,
and that was why he gave that little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull's charge from his own body to the
flannel.  they  preferred  belmonte's  imitation  of  himself  or  marcial's  imitation  of  belmonte.  there  were  three  of
them in the row behind us.
"what's he afraid of the bull for? the bull's so dumb he only goes after the cloth."

"he's just a young bull-fighter. he hasn't learned it yet."

"but i thought he was fine with the cape before."

"probably he's nervous now."


out in the centre of the ring, all alone, romero was going on with the same thing, getting so close that the bull
could see him plainly, offering the bo

people's shoulders. but they held him and lifted him.
it was uncomfortable and his legs were spraddled and his body was very sore. they were lifting him and all running
toward  the  gate.  he  had  his  hand  on  somebody's  shoulder.  he  looked  around  at  us  apologetically.  the  crowd,
running, went out the gate with him.

we all three went back to the hotel. brett went upstairs. bill and i sat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate
some hard-boiled eggs and drank several bottles of beer. belmonte came down in his street clothes with his manager
and two other men. they sat at the next table and ate. belmonte ate very little. they were leaving on the seven
o'clock train for barcelona. belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and ate soft-boiled eggs. the others
ate a big meal. belmonte did not talk. he only answered questions.

watched belmonte and the people at his table. the men with him were tough-looking and businesslike.

bill was tired after the bull-fight. so was i. we b
