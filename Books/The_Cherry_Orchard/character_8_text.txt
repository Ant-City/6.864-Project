woman.... he fell in love with a woman of the town, and it seemed to him
that there wasn’t any more beautiful thing in the wide world. a fool may
love as much as a wise man. the girl’s people were all right.... but
she wasn’t exactly loose, but just... giddy... always changing her mind!
always winking at one! always laughing and laughing.... no sense at all.

natalya stepanovna. what a pity! why?

lomov. i don’t know.... must have got twisted, or bitten by some other
dog.... [sighs] my very best dog, to say nothing of the expense. i gave
mironov 125 roubles for him.

natalya stepanovna. it was too much, ivan vassilevitch.

lomov. i think it was very cheap. he’s a first-rate dog.

natalya stepanovna. papa gave 85 roubles for his squeezer, and squeezer
is heaps better than guess!

lomov. squeezer better than. guess? what an idea! [laughs] squeezer
better than guess!

natalya stepanovna. of course he’s better! of course, squeezer is
young, he may develop a bit, but on points and pedigree he’s better than
anything that even volchanetsky has got.

overshot, and an overshot always means the dog is

to get hold of anything...

natalya stepanovna. in the first place, our squeezer is a thoroughbred
animal, the son of harness and chisels, while there’s no getting at
the pedigree of your dog at all.... he’s old and as ugly as a worn-out
cab-horse.

lomov. he is old, but i wouldn’t take five squeezers for him.... why,
how can you?... guess is a dog; as for squeezer, well, it’s too funny to
argue.... anybody you like has a dog as good as squeezer... you may find

that guess is better than squeezer. i don’t like people who don’t say
what they mean, because you know perfectly well that squeezer is a
hundred times better than your silly guess. why do you want to say it
isn’t?

lomov. i see, natalya stepanovna, that you consider me either blind or a

its capital, and the absence of serious operations of any description,

strange, inconvenient, stupid, unclean, perhaps even sinful....

gaev. don’t cry. my aunt’s very rich, but she doesn’t like us. my
sister, in the first place, married an advocate, not a noble.... [anya
appears in the doorway] she not only married a man who was not a noble,
but she behaved herself in a way which cannot be described as proper.
she’s nice and kind and charming, and i’m very fond of her, but say what
you will in her favour and you still have to admit that she’s wicked;
you can feel it in her slightest movements.

gaev. really? [pause] it’s curious, something’s got into my righ

s grant, i am wrong; then why did i wake up this morning, to give an
example, and behold an enormous spider on my chest, like that. [shows
with both hands] and if i do drink some kvass, why is it that there is
bound to be something of the most indelicate nature in it, such as a
beetle? [pause] have you read buckle? [pause] i should like to trouble
you, avdotya fedorovna, for two words.

dunyasha. say on.

epikhodov. i should prefer to be alone with you. [sighs.]

dunyasha. [shy] very well, only first bring me my little cloak.... it’s
by the cupboard. it’s a little damp here.

epikhodov. very well... i’ll bring it.... now i know what to do with my
revolver. [takes guitar and exits, strumming.]

yasha. two-and-twenty troubles! a silly man, between you and me and the
gatepost. [yawns.]

dunyasha. i hope to goodness he won’t shoot himself. [pause] i’m so
nervous, i’m worried. i went into service when i was quite a little
girl, and now i’m not used to common life, and my hands are

lubov. we have been too sinful....

lopakhin. what sins have you committed?

gaev. [puts candy into his mouth] they say that i’ve eaten all my
substance in sugar-candies. [laughs.]

lubov. oh, my sins.... i’ve always scattered money about without holding
myself in, like a madwoman, and i married a man who made nothing but
debts. my husband died of champagne--he drank terribly--and to my
misfortune, i fell in love with another man and went off with him, and
just at that time--it was my first punishment, a blow that hit me right
on the head--here, in the river... my boy was drowned, and i went away,
quite away, never to return, never to see this river again...i shut my
eyes and ran without thinking, but _he_ ran after me... without pity,
without respect. i bought a villa near mentone because _he_ fell ill
there, and for three years i knew no rest either by day or night; the
sick man wore me out, and my soul dried up. and last year, when they
had sold the villa to pay my debts, i we

fiers. [to gaev] please, sir, put this on, it’s damp.

gaev. [putting it on] you’re a nuisance, old man.

fiers it’s all very well.... you went away this morning without telling
me. [examining gaev.]

lubov. how old you’ve grown, fiers!

fiers. i beg your pardon?

lopakhin. she says you’ve grown very old!

fiers. i’ve been alive a long time. they were already getting ready
to marry me before your father was born.... [laughs] and when the
emancipation came i was already first valet. only i didn’t agree with
the emancipation and remained with my people.... [pause] i remember
everybody was happy, but they didn’t know why.

lopakhin. it was very good for them in the old days. at any rate, they
used to beat them.

fiers. [not hearing] rather. the peasants kept their distance from the
masters and the masters kept their distance from the peasants, but now
everything’s all anyhow and you can’t understand anything.

orchard, then the old bark on the trees sheds a dim light and the old
cherry-trees seem to be dreaming of all that was a hundred, two hundred
years ago, and are oppressed by their heavy visions. still, at any
rate, we’ve left those two hundred years behind us. so far we’ve gained
nothing at all--we don’t yet know what the past is to be to us--we only
philosophize, we complain that we are dull, or we drink vodka. for it’s
so clear that in order to begin to live in the present we must first
redeem the past, and that can only be done by suffering, by strenuous,
uninterrupted labour. understand that, anya.

and go away. be as free as the wind.
