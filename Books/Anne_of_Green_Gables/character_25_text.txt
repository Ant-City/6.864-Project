exclamation points. a boy! marilla and matthew cuthbert of all people
adopting a boy! from an orphan asylum! well, the world was certainly
turning upside down! she would be surprised at nothing after this!
nothing!

â€œwhat on earth put such a notion into your head?â€ she demanded
disapprovingly.

this had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be
disapproved.

â€œwell, weâ€™ve been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,â€
 returned marilla. â€œmrs. alexander spencer was up here one day before
christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the
asylum over in hopeton in the spring. her cousin lives there and mrs.
spencer has visited here and knows all about it. so matthew and i have
talked it over off and on ever since. we thought weâ€™d get a boy. matthew
is getting up in years, you know--heâ€™s sixty--and he isnâ€™t so spry as he
once was. his heart troubles him a good deal. and you know how desperate
hard itâ€™s got to be to get hired help

get one broke into your ways and taught something heâ€™s up and off to the
lobster canneries or the states. at first matthew suggested getting a
home boy. but i said â€˜noâ€™ flat to that. â€˜they may be all right--iâ€™m not
saying theyâ€™re not--but no london street arabs for me,â€™ i said. â€˜give
me a native born at least. thereâ€™ll be a risk, no matter who we get. but
iâ€™ll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born
canadian.â€™ so in the end we decided to ask mrs. spencer to pick us out
one when she went over to get her little girl. we heard last week she
was going, so we sent her word by richard spencerâ€™s folks at carmody
to bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. we decided that
would be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores
right off and young enough to be trained up proper. we mean to give him
a good home and schooling. we had a telegram from mrs. alexander spencer
today--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying th

on the five-thirty train tonight. so matthew went to bright river to
meet him. mrs. spencer will drop him off there. of course she goes on to
white sands station herself.â€

mrs. rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind; she proceeded to
speak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece
of news.

â€œwell, marilla, iâ€™ll just tell you plain that i think youâ€™re doing a
mighty foolish thing--a risky thing, thatâ€™s what. you donâ€™t know what
youâ€™re getting. youâ€™re bringing a strange child into your house and home
and you donâ€™t know a single thing

warn you if he burns green gables down or puts strychnine in the well--i
heard of a case over in new brunswick where an orphan asylum child did
that and the whole family died in fearful agonies. only, it was a girl
in that instance.â€

â€œwell, weâ€™re not getting a girl,â€ said marilla, as if poisoning wells
were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case
of a boy. â€œiâ€™d never dream of taking a girl to bring up. i wonder at
mrs. alexander spencer for doing it. but there, _she_ wouldnâ€™t shrink
from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head.â€

mrs. rachel would have liked to stay until matthew came home with his
imported orphan. but reflecting that it would be a good two hours at
least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to robert
bellâ€™s and tell the news. it would certainly make a sensation second
to none, and mrs. rachel dearly loved to make a sensation. so she took
herself away, somewhat to marill

that brisk official. â€œbut there was a passenger dropped off for you--a
little girl. sheâ€™s sitting out there on the shingles. i asked her to
go into the ladiesâ€™ waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she
preferred to stay outside. â€˜there was more scope for imagination,â€™ she
said. sheâ€™s a case, i should say.â€

â€œiâ€™m not expecting a girl,â€ said matthew blankly. â€œitâ€™s a boy iâ€™ve come
for. he should be here. mrs. alexander spencer was to bring him over
from nova scotia for me.â€

the stationmaster whistled.

â€œguess thereâ€™s some mistake,â€ he said. â€œmrs. spencer came off the train
with that girl and gave her into my charge. said you and your sister
were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for
her presently. thatâ€™s all i know about it--and i havenâ€™t got any more
orphans concealed hereabouts.â€

â€œoh, i can carry it,â€ the child responded cheerfully. â€œit isnâ€™t heavy.
iâ€™ve got all my worldly goods in it, but it isnâ€™t heavy. and if it isnâ€™t
carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so iâ€™d better
keep it because i know the exact knack of it. itâ€™s an extremely old
carpet-bag. oh, iâ€™m very glad youâ€™ve come, even if it would have been
nice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. weâ€™ve got to drive a long piece,
havenâ€™t we? mrs. spencer said it was eight miles. iâ€™m glad because i
love driving. oh, it seems so wonderful that iâ€™m going to live with you
and belong to you. iâ€™ve never belonged to anybody--not really. but the
asylum was the worst. iâ€™ve only been in it four months, but that was
enough. i donâ€™t suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you
canâ€™t possibly understand what it is like. itâ€™s worse than anything you
could imagine. mrs. spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like
that, but i didnâ€™t m

i had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you _are_
imagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big
hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and
boots. i felt cheered up right away and i enjoyed my trip to the island
with all my might. i wasnâ€™t a bit sick coming over in the boat. neither
was mrs. spencer although she generally is. she said she hadnâ€™t time
to get sick, watching to see that i didnâ€™t fall overboard. she said she
never saw the beat of me for prowling about. but if it kept her from
being seasick itâ€™s a mercy i did prowl, isnâ€™t it? and i wanted to see
everything that was to be seen on that boat, because i didnâ€™t know
whether iâ€™d ever have another opportunity. oh, there are a lot more

but those red roads are so funny. when we got into the train at
charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past i asked mrs. spencer
what made them red and she said she didnâ€™t know and for pityâ€™s sake not
to ask her any more questions. she said i must have asked her a thousand

things if you donâ€™t ask questions? and what _does_ make the roads red?â€

â€œwell now, i dunno,â€ said matthew.

to think of all the things there are to find out about? it just makes

that children should be seen and not heard. iâ€™ve had that said to me a
million times if i have once. and people laugh at me because i use big
words. but if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express
them, havenâ€™t you?â€

â€œwell now, that seems reasonable,â€ said matthew.

â€œmrs. spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle. but it
isnâ€™t--itâ€™s firmly fastened at one end. mrs. spencer said your place was
named green gables. i asked her all about it. and she said there were
trees all around it. i was gladder than ever. i just love trees. and
there werenâ€™t any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny
things out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them.
they just looked like orphans themselves, those trees did. it used to

this morning. you do get so attached to things like that, donâ€™t you? is
there a brook anywhere near green gables? i forgot to ask mrs. spencer
that.â€

â€œwell now, yes, thereâ€™s one right below the house.â€

never expected i would, though. dreams donâ€™t often come true, do they?

ful. have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be
divinely beautiful?â€

â€œwell now, no, i havenâ€™t,â€ confessed matthew ingenuously.

â€œi have, often. which would you rather be if you had the
choice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?â€

â€œwell now, i--i donâ€™t know exactly.â€

â€œneither do i. i can never decide. but it doesnâ€™t make much real
difference for it isnâ€™t likely iâ€™ll ever be either. itâ€™s certain iâ€™ll
never be angelically good. mrs. spencer says--oh, mr. cuthbert! oh, mr.
cuthbert!! oh, mr. cuthbert!!!â€

that was not what mrs. spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled
out of the buggy nor had matthew done anything astonishing. they had
simply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the â€œavenue.â€

the â€œavenue,â€ so called by the newbridge people, was a stretch of road
four or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge,
wide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old
farmer

to another the childâ€™s eyes darted, eager and wistful. at last they
lingered on one away to the left, far back from the road, dimly white
with blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods. over it,
in the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining
like a lamp of guidance and promise.

â€œthatâ€™s it, isnâ€™t it?â€ she said, pointing.

matthew slapped the reins on the sorrelâ€™s back delightedly.

â€œwell now, youâ€™ve guessed it! but i reckon mrs. spencer described it
soâ€™s you could tell.â€

â€œno, she didnâ€™t--really she didnâ€™t. all she said might just as well have
been about most of those other places. i hadnâ€™t any real idea what it
looked like. but just as soon as i saw it i felt it was home. oh, it
seems as if i must be in a dream. do you know, my arm must be black and
blue from the elbow up, for iâ€™ve pinched myself so many times today.

eyes fell on the odd little figure in the stiff, ugly dress, with the
long braids of red hair and the eager, luminous eyes, she stopped short
in amazement.

â€œmatthew cuthbert, whoâ€™s that?â€ she ejaculated. â€œwhere is the boy?â€

â€œthere wasnâ€™t any boy,â€ said matthew wretchedly. â€œthere was only _her_.â€

he nodded at the child, remembering that he had never even asked her
name.

â€œno boy! but there _must_ have been a boy,â€ insisted marilla. â€œwe sent
word to mrs. spencer to bring a boy.â€

â€œwell, she didnâ€™t. she brought _her_. i asked the station-master. and i
had to bring her home. she couldnâ€™t be left there, no matter where the
mistake had come in.â€

â€œwell, this is a pretty piece of business!â€ ejaculated marilla.

during this dialogue the child had remained silent, her eyes roving from
one to the other, all the animation fading out of her face. suddenly
she seemed to grasp the full meaning of what had been said. dropping her

much more distinguished. if youâ€™ll only call me anne spelled with an e i

â€œoh, yes, there was an abundance of them. but mrs. spencer said
_distinctly_ that you wanted a girl about eleven years old. and the
matron said she thought i would do. you donâ€™t know how delighted i was.
i couldnâ€™t sleep all last night for joy. oh,â€ she added reproachfully,

didnâ€™t want me and leave me there? if i hadnâ€™t seen the white way of

â€œwhat on earth does she mean?â€ demanded marilla, staring at matthew.

â€œshe--sheâ€™s just referring to some conversation we had on the road,â€
 said matthew hastily. â€œiâ€™m going out to put the mare in, marilla. have
tea ready when i come back.â€

â€œdid mrs. spencer bring anybody over besides you?â€ continued marilla
when matthew had gone out.

â€œshe brought lily jones for herself. lily is only five years old and she
is very beautiful and had nut-brown hair. if i was very beautiful and
had nut-brown hair would you keep me?â€

â€œno. we want a boy to help matthew on the farm. a girl would be of
no use to us. take off your hat. iâ€™ll lay it and your bag on the hall
table.â€

anne took off her hat meekly. matthew came back presently and they sat

dishes. matthew was smoking--a sure sign of perturbation of mind. he
seldom smoked, for marilla set her face against it as a filthy habit;
but at certain times and seasons he felt driven to it and them marilla
winked at the practice, realizing that a mere man must have some vent
for his emotions.

â€œwell, this is a pretty kettle of fish,â€ she said wrathfully. â€œthis is
what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves. richard spencerâ€™s
folks have twisted that message somehow. one of us will have to drive
over and see mrs. spencer tomorrow, thatâ€™s certain. this girl will have
to be sent back to the asylum.â€

â€œyes, i suppose so,â€ said matthew reluctantly.

â€œyou _suppose_ so! donâ€™t you know it?â€

â€œwell now, sheâ€™s a real nice little thing, marilla. itâ€™s kind of a pity
to send her back when sheâ€™s so set on staying here.â€

â€œmatthew cuthbert, you donâ€™t mean to say you think we ought to keep
her!â€

sympathetic. he didnâ€™t mind how much i talked--he seemed to like it. i
felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever i saw him.â€

â€œyouâ€™re both queer enough, if thatâ€™s what you mean by kindred spirits,â€
 said marilla with a sniff. â€œyes, you may wash the dishes. take plenty of
hot water, and be sure you dry them well. iâ€™ve got enough to attend to
this morning for iâ€™ll have to drive over to white sands in the afternoon
and see mrs. spencer. youâ€™ll come with me and weâ€™ll settle whatâ€™s to be
done with you. after youâ€™ve finished the dishes go up-stairs and make
your bed.â€

anne washed the dishes deftly enough, as marilla who kept a sharp eye on
the process, discerned. later on she made her bed less successfully, for
she had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick. but is
was done somehow and smoothed down; and then marilla, to get rid of her,
told her she might go out-of-doors and amuse herself until dinner

anne had relapsed into reverie, with her chin in her hands and her eyes
on the sky, when marilla returned from her cellar pilgrimage. there
marilla left her until the early dinner was on the table.

â€œi suppose i can have the mare and buggy this afternoon, matthew?â€ said
marilla.

matthew nodded and looked wistfully at anne. marilla intercepted the
look and said grimly:

â€œiâ€™m going to drive over to white sands and settle this thing. iâ€™ll take
anne with me and mrs. spencer will probably make arrangements to send
her back to nova scotia at once. iâ€™ll set your tea out for you and iâ€™ll
be home in time to milk the cows.â€

still matthew said nothing and marilla had a sense of having wasted
words and breath. there is nothing more aggravating than a man who wonâ€™t
talk back--unless it is a woman who wonâ€™t.

matthew hitched the sorrel into the buggy in due time and marilla and
anne set off. matthew opened the yard gate for them and as they drove
slowly through,

â€œi lived up river with mrs. hammond over two years, and then mr. hammond

among her relatives and went to the states. i had to go to the asylum
at hopeton, because nobody would take me. they didnâ€™t want me at the
asylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. but they had
to take me and i was there four months until mrs. spencer came.â€

anne finished up with another sigh, of relief this time. evidently
she did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not
wanted her.

â€œdid you ever go to school?â€ demanded marilla, turning the sorrel mare
down the shore road.

â€œnot a great deal. i went a little the last year i stayed with mrs.

couldnâ€™t walk it in winter and there was a vacation in summer, so i
could only go in the spring and fall

â€œthatâ€™s the white sands hotel. mr. kirke runs it, but the season hasnâ€™t

think this shore is just about right.â€

yellow house at white sands cove, and she came to the door with surprise
and welcome mingled on her benevolent face.

â€œbut i promised matthew iâ€™d be home early. the fact is, mrs. spencer,
thereâ€™s been a queer mistake somewhere, and iâ€™ve come over to see where
it is. we send word, matthew and i, for you to bring us a boy from the
asylum. we told your brother robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or
eleven years old.â€

â€œmarilla cuthbert, you donâ€™t say so!â€ said mrs. spencer in distress.
â€œwhy, robert sent word down by his daughter nancy and she said you
wanted a girl--didnâ€™t she flora jane?â€ appealing to her daughter who had
come out to the steps.

thought i was following your instructions. nancy is a terrible flighty
thing. iâ€™ve often had to scold her well for her heedlessness.â€

â€œit was our own fault,â€ said marilla resignedly. â€œwe should have come
to you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by
word of mouth in that fashion. anyhow, the mistake has been made and the
only thing to do is to set it

 right. can we send the child back to the
asylum? i suppose theyâ€™ll take her back, wonâ€™t they?â€

â€œi suppose so,â€ said mrs. spencer thoughtfully, â€œbut i donâ€™t think
it will be necessary to send her back. mrs. peter blewett was up here
yesterday, and she was saying to me how much she wished sheâ€™d sent by me
for a little girl to help her. mrs. peter has a large family, you know,
and she finds it hard to get help. anne will be the very girl for you. i
call it positively providential.â€

marilla did not look as if she thought providence had much to do with
the matter. here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwe

rfluous flesh on her bones. but she had
heard of her. â€œa terrible worker and driver,â€ mrs. peter was said to
be; and discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and
stinginess, and her family of pert, quarrelsome children. marilla felt
a qualm of conscience at the thought of handing anne over to her tender
mercies.

â€œwell, iâ€™ll go in and weâ€™ll talk the matter over,â€ she said.

â€œand if there isnâ€™t mrs. peter coming up the lane this blessed minute!â€
 exclaimed mrs. spencer, bustling her guests through the hall into the
parlor, where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been
strained so long through dark green, closely drawn blinds that it had
lost every particle of warmth it had ever possessed. â€œthat is real
lucky, for we can settle the matter right away. take the armchair, miss
cuthbert. anne, you sit here on the ottoman and donâ€™t wiggle. let
me take your hats. flora jane, go out and put the kettle on. good

mrs. spencer whisked away, after pulling up the blinds. anne sitting
mutely on the ottoman, with her hands clasped tightly in her lap, stared
at mrs blewett as one fascinated. was she to be given into the keeping
of this sharp-faced, sharp-eyed woman? she felt a lump coming up in her
throat and her eyes smarted painfully. she was beginning to be afraid
she couldnâ€™t keep the tears back when mrs. spencer returned, flushed
and beaming, quite capable of taking any and every difficulty, physical,
mental or spi

is going to stay with us. will that suit you, mrs. blewett?â€

â€œi suppose itâ€™ll have to,â€ said mrs. blewett ungraciously.

during marillaâ€™s speech a sunrise had been dawning on anneâ€™s face. first
the look of despair faded out; then came a faint flush of hope;
her eyes grew deep and bright as morning stars. the child was quite
transfigured; and, a moment later, when mrs. spencer and mrs. blewett
went out in quest of a recipe the latter had come to borrow she sprang
up and flew across the room to marilla.

â€œoh, miss cuthbert, did you really say that perhaps you would let me
stay at green gables?â€ she said, in a breathless whisper, as if speaking
aloud might shatter the glorious possibility. â€œdid you really say it? or
did i only imagine that you did?â€

â€œi think youâ€™d better learn to control that imagination of yours, anne,

when they arrived back at green gables that evening matthew met them in
the lane. marilla from afar had noted him prowling along it and guessed
his motive. she was prepared for the relief she read in his face when he
saw that she had at least brought back anne back with her. but she said
nothing, to him, relative to the affair, until they were both out in the
yard behind the barn milking the cows. then she briefly told him anneâ€™s
history and the result of the interview with mrs. spencer.

â€œi wouldnâ€™t give a dog i liked to that blewett woman,â€ said matthew with
unusual vim.

â€œi donâ€™t fancy her style myself,â€ admitted marilla, â€œbut itâ€™s that
or keeping her ourselves, matthew. and since you seem to want her, i
suppose iâ€™m willing--or have to be. iâ€™ve been thinking over the idea
until iâ€™ve got kind of used to it. it seems a sort of duty. iâ€™ve never
brought up a child, especially a girl, and i dare say iâ€™ll make a
terrible mess of it. but iâ€™ll do my best

in the yard and then i washed the spoon in three waters. marilla was out

sauce to the pigs; but when she did come in i was imagining that i was
a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow,
whichever they wanted to be, so i never thought about the pudding sauce
again and marilla sent me out to pick apples. well, mr. and mrs. chester

stylish people, especially mrs. chester ross. when marilla called me in
dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table. i tried to be as
polite and dignified as i could be, for i wanted mrs. chester ross to
think i was a ladylike little girl even if i wasnâ€™t pretty. everything
went right until i saw marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand
and the pitcher of pudding sauce _warmed up_, in the other. diana, that

 said anne, who was hurrying on hood and jacket. â€œi know it as well as
if heâ€™d said so. matthew and i are such kindred spirits i can read his
thoughts without words at all.â€

â€œdonâ€™t cry, di,â€ said anne cheerily. â€œi know exactly what to do for
croup. you forget that mrs. hammond had twins three times. when you look
after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience. they
all had croup regularly. just wait till i get the ipecac bottle--you
maynâ€™t have any at your house. come on now.â€

the two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried throu

 to the ipecac but anne had not brought up
three pairs of twins for nothing. down that ipecac went, not only once,
but many times during the long, anxious night when the two little girls
worked patiently over the suffering minnie may, and young mary joe,
honestly anxious to do all she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated
more water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies.

it was three oâ€™clock when matthew came with a doctor, for he had been
obliged to go all the way to spencervale for one. but the pressing need
for assistance was past. minnie may was much better and was sleeping
soundly.

â€œi was awfully near giving up in despair,â€ explained anne. â€œshe got
worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the hammond twins were,
even the last pair. i actually thought she was going to choke to death.
i gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose
went down i said to myself--not to diana or young mary joe, because i
didnâ€™t want to worry them

chapter xxxi. where the brook and river meet


|anne had her â€œgoodâ€ summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly. she and diana
fairly lived outdoors, reveling in all the delights that loverâ€™s lane
and the dryadâ€™s bubble and willowmere and victoria island afforded.
marilla offered no objections to anneâ€™s gypsyings. the spencervale
doctor who had come the night minnie may had the croup met anne at the
house of a patient one afternoon early in vacation, looked her over
sharply, screwed up his mouth, shook his head, and sent a message to
marilla cuthbert by another person. it was:

â€œkeep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and donâ€™t
let her read books until she gets more spring into her step.â€

this message frightened marilla wholesomely. she read anneâ€™s death
warrant by consumption in it unl

ess it was scrupulously obeyed. as a
result, anne had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and
frolic went. she walked, rowed, berried, and dreamed to her heartâ€™s
content; and when september came she was bright-eyed and alert, with a
step that would have satisfied the spencervale doctor and a heart full
of ambition and zest once more.

â€œi feel just like studying with might and main,â€ she declared as she
brought her books down from the attic. â€œoh, you good old friends, iâ€™m
glad to see your honest faces once more--yes, even you, geometry. iâ€™ve
had a perfectly beautiful summer, marilla, and now iâ€™m rejoicing as a
strong man to run a race, as mr. allan said last sunday. doesnâ€™t mr.
allan preach magnificent sermons? mrs. lynde says he is improving every
day

ore anneâ€™s eager eyes.


      â€œhills peeped oâ€™er hill and alps on alps arose.â€


much of all this was due to miss stacyâ€™s tactful, careful, broadminded
guidance. she led her class to think and explore and discover for
themselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree
that quite shocked mrs. lynde and the school trustees, who viewed all
innovations on established methods rather dubiously.

apart from her studies anne expanded socially, for marilla, mindful of
the spencervale doctorâ€™s dictum, no longer vetoed occasional outings.
the debating club flourished and gave several concerts; there were one
or two parties almost verging on grown-up affairs; there were sleigh
drives and skating frolics galore.

between times anne grew, shooting up so rapidly that marilla was
astonished one day, when they were standing side by side, to find the
girl was taller than herself.

â€œwhy, anne, how youâ€™ve grown!â€ she said, almost unbelievingly. a sigh
followed on the words

top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a
low white bed.

anne was dressing for a concert at the white sands hotel. the guests had
got it up in aid of the charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all
the available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it
along. bertha sampson and pearl clay of the white sands baptist choir
had been asked to sing a duet; milton clark of newbridge was to give a
violin solo; winnie adella blair of carmody was to sing a scotch ballad;
and laura spencer of spencervale and anne shirley of avonlea were to
recite.

as anne would have said at one time, it was â€œan epoch in her life,â€ and
she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. matthew was in
the seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his
anne and marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather
than admit it, and said she didnâ€™t think it was very proper for a lot
of young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible
person

na, i love this little room so dearly. i donâ€™t know how
iâ€™ll get along without it when i go to town next month.â€

â€œdonâ€™t speak of your going away tonight,â€ begged diana. â€œi donâ€™t want to
think of it, it makes me so miserable, and i do want to have a good time
this evening. what are you going to recite, anne? and are you nervous?â€

â€œnot a bit. iâ€™ve recited so often in public i donâ€™t mind at all now.
iâ€™ve decided to give â€˜the maidenâ€™s vow.â€™ itâ€™s so pathetic. laura spencer
is going to give a comic recitation, but iâ€™d rather make people cry than
laugh.â€

â€œwhat will you recite if they encore you?â€

â€œthey wonâ€™t dream of encoring me,â€ scoffed anne, who was not without her
own secret hopes that they would, and already visioned herself telling
matthew all about it at the next morningâ€™s breakfast table. â€œthere are
billy and jane now--i hear the wheels. come on.â€

billy andrews insisted that anne should ride on the front seat with him,
so she unwillin

atthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went
out-of-doors. under the stars of the blue summer night he walked
agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars.

â€œwell now, i guess she ainâ€™t been much spoiled,â€ he muttered, proudly.
â€œi guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all.
sheâ€™s smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the
rest. sheâ€™s been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake
than what mrs. spencer made--if it _was_ luck. i donâ€™t believe it was any
such thing. it was providence, because the almighty saw we needed her, i
reckon.â€

the day finally came when anne must go to town. she and matthew drove
in one fine september morning, after a tearful parting with diana and an
untearful practical one--on marillaâ€™s side at least--with marilla. but
when anne had gone diana dried her tears and went to a beach picnic at
white sands with some of her carmody cousins, where she contrived
to enjoy

 in her hands.

â€œyou are not looking as well yourself as iâ€™d like to see you, marilla.
you look tired. iâ€™m afraid youâ€™ve been working too hard. you must take
a rest, now that iâ€™m home. iâ€™m just going to take this one day off to
visit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, and then it will
be your turn to be lazy while i do the work.â€

marilla smiled affectionately at her girl.

â€œitâ€™s not the work--itâ€™s my head. iâ€™ve got a pain so often now--behind
my eyes. doctor spencerâ€™s been fussing with glasses, but they donâ€™t do
me any good. there is a distinguished oculist coming to the island the
last of june and the doctor says i must see him. i guess iâ€™ll have to.
i canâ€™t read or sew with any comfort now. well, anne, youâ€™ve done real
well at queenâ€™s i must say. to take first class license in one year and
win the avery scholarship--well, well, mrs. lynde says pride goes before
a fall and she doesnâ€™t believe in the higher education of women at all;

lege,â€
 said mrs. allan.

anne did not reply; she said good night and went slowly back to green
gables. marilla was sitting on the front door-steps and anne sat down
beside her. the door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch
shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions.

anne gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in
her hair. she liked the delicious hint of fragrance, as some aerial
benediction, above her every time she moved.

â€œdoctor spencer was here while you were away,â€ marilla said. â€œhe says
that the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that i must
go in and have my eyes examined. i suppose iâ€™d better go and have it
over. iâ€™ll be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind
of glasses to suit my eyes. you wonâ€™t mind staying here alone while iâ€™m
away, will you? martin will have to drive me in and thereâ€™s ironing and
baking to do.â€

â€œi shall be all right. diana will come over for company
