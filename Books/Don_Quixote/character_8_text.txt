"heed not that, dear altisidora," replied a voice; "the duchess is no
doubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord of thy heart and
disturber of thy soul; for just now i perceived him open the grated
window of his chamber, so he must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer, in a

sel of the duchess's was in love with him, and
that her modesty forced her to keep her passion secret. he trembled lest
he should fall, and made an inward resolution not to yield; and
commending himself with all his might and soul to his lady dulcinea he
made up his mind to listen to the music; and to let them know he was
there he gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels were not a little
delighted, for all they wanted was that don quixote should hear them. so
having tuned the harp, altisidora, running her hand across the strings,
began this ballad:

o thou that art above in bed,
  between the holland sheets,
a-lying there from night till morn,
  with outstretched legs asleep;

o thou, most valiant knight of all
  the famed manchegan breed,
of purity and virtue more
  than gold of araby;

give ear unto a suffering maid,

for those two suns of thine have lit

  and though my mouth be wide,
my teeth like topazes exalt
  my beauty to the sky.

thou knowest that my voice is sweet,

and i am moulded in a form
  somewhat below the mean.

these charms, and many more, are thine,
  spoils to thy spear and bow all;
a damsel of this house am i,
  by name altisidora.

here the lay of the heart-stricken altisidora came to an end, while the
warmly wooed don quixote began to feel alarm; and with a deep sigh he
said to himself, "o that i should be such an unlucky knight that no
damsel can set eyes on me but falls in love with me! o that the peerless
dulcinea should be so unfortunate that they cannot let her enjoy my
incomparable constancy in peace! what would ye with her, ye queens? why
do ye persecute her, ye empresses? why ye pursue her, ye virgins o

i am honey, for you aloes. for me dulcinea alone is beautiful, wise,
virtuous, graceful, and high-bred, and all others are ill-favoured,
foolish, light, and low-born. nature sent me into the world to be hers
and no other's; altisidora may weep or sing, the lady for whose sake they
belaboured me in the castle of the enchanted moor may give way to
despair, but i must be dulcinea's, boiled or roast, pure, courteous, and
chaste, in spite of all the magic-working powers on earth." and with that
he shut the window with a bang, and, as much out of temper and out of
sorts as if some great misfortune had befallen him, stretched himself on
his bed, where we will leave him for the present, as the great sancho

if the previous decision about the cattle dealer's purse excited the
admiration of the bystanders, this provoked their laughter; however, the
governor's orders were after all executed. all this, having been taken
down by his chronicler, was at once despatched to the duke, who was
looking out for it with great eagerness; and here let us leave the good
sancho; for his master, sorely troubled in mind by altisidora's music,
has pressing claims upon us now.

we left don quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music of the
enamourned maid altisidora had given rise to. he went to bed with them,
and just like fleas they would not let him sleep or get a moment's rest,
and the broken stitches of his stockings helped them. but as time is

on his travelling boots to hide the disaster to his stockings. he threw
over him his scarlet mantle, put on his head a montera of green velvet
trimmed with silver edging, flung across his shoulder the baldric with
his good trenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he always carried
with him, and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the
antechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting
for him. but as he passed through a gallery, altisidora and the other
damsel, her friend, were lying in wait for him, and the instant
altisidora saw him she pretended to faint, while her friend caught her in
her lap, and began hastily unlacing the bosom of her dress.

don quixote observed it, and approaching them said, "i know very well
what this seizure arises from."

"i know not from what," replied the friend, "for altisidora is the
healthiest damsel in all this house, and i have never heard her complain
all the time i have known her. a

f they be all ungrateful! go away, senor don quixote; for this
poor child will not come to herself again so long as you are here."

to which don quixote returned, "do me the favour, senora, to let a lute
be placed in my chamber to-night; and i will comfort this poor maiden to
the best of my power; for in the early stages of love a prompt
disillusion is an approved remedy;" and with this he retired, so as not
to be remarked by any who might see him there.

he had scarcely withdrawn when altisidora, recovering from her swoon,
said to her companion, "the lute must be left, for no doubt don quixote
intends to give us some music; and being his it will not be bad."

they went at once to inform the duchess of what was going on, and of the
lute don quixote asked for, and she, delighted beyond measure, plotted
with the duke and her two damsels to play him a trick that should be
amusing but harmless; and in high glee they waited for night, which came
quickly as the day had come; and as fo

don quixote had got so far with his song, to which the duke, the duchess,
altisidora, and nearly the whole household of the castle were listening,
when all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactly over his
window they let down a cord with more than a hundred bells attached to
it, and immediately after that discharged a great sack full of cats,
which also had bells of smaller size tied to their tails. such was the
din of the bells and the squalling of the cats, that though the duke and
duchess were the contrivers of the joke they were startled by it, while

but at last the duke pulled it off and flung it out of the window. don
quixote was left with a face as full of holes as a sieve and a nose not
in very good condition, and greatly vexed that they did not let him
finish the battle he had been so stoutly fighting with that villain of an
enchanter. they sent for some oil of john's wort, and altisidora herself
with her own fair hands bandaged all the wounded parts; and as she did so
she said to him in a low voice. "all these mishaps have befallen thee,
hardhearted knight, for the sin of thy insensibility and obstinacy; and
god grant thy squire sancho may forget to whip himself, so that that
dearly beloved dulcinea of thine may never be released from her
enchantment, that thou mayest never come to her bed, at least while i who
adore thee am alive."

of what befell don quixote with dona rodriguez, the duchess's duenna,
together with other occurrences worthy of record and eternal remembrance


exceedingly moody and dejected was the sorely wounded don quixote, with
his face bandaged and marked, not by the hand of god, but by the claws of
a cat, mishaps incidental to knight-errantry.

six days he remained without appearing in public, and one night as he lay
awake thinking of his misfortunes and of altisidora's pursuit of him, he
perceived that some one was opening the door of his room with a key, and
he at once made up his mind that the enamoured damsel was coming to make
an assault upon his chastity and put him in danger of failing in the
fidelity he owed to his lady dulcinea del toboso. "no," said he, firmly
persuaded of the truth of his idea (and he said it loud enough to be
heard), "the greatest beauty upon earth shall not avail to make me
renounce my adoration of her whom i bear stamped

hine." the very instant he had uttered these words, the door
opened. he stood up on the bed wrapped from head to foot in a yellow
satin coverlet, with a cap on his head, and his face and his moustaches
tied up, his face because of the scratches, and his moustaches to keep
them from drooping and falling down, in which trim he looked the most
extraordinary scarecrow that could be conceived. he kept his eyes fixed
on the door, and just as he was expecting to see the love-smitten and
unhappy altisidora make her appearance, he saw coming in a most venerable
duenna, in a long white-bordered veil that covered and enveloped her from
head to foot. between the fingers of her left hand she held a short
lighted candle, while with her right she shaded it to keep the light from
her eyes, which were covered by spectacles of great size, and she
advanced with noiseless steps, treading very softly.

don quixote kept an eye upon her from his watchtower, and observing her
costume and noting her silen

to don quixote's, another duenna who slept with her observed her, and as
all duennas are fond of prying, listening, and sniffing, she followed her
so silently that the good rodriguez never perceived it; and as soon as
the duenna saw her enter don quixote's room, not to fail in a duenna's
invariable practice of tattling, she hurried off that instant to report
to the duchess how dona rodriguez was closeted with don quixote. the
duchess told the duke, and asked him to let her and altisidora go and see
what the said duenna wanted with don quixote. the duke gave them leave,
and the pair cautiously and quietly crept to the door of the room and
posted themselves so close to it that they could hear all that was said
inside. but when the duchess heard how the rodriguez had made public the
aranjuez of her issues she could not restrain herself, nor altisidora
either; and so, filled with rage and thirsting for vengeance, they burst
into the room and tormented don quixote and flogged

don quixote now felt it right to quit a life of such idleness as he was
leading in the castle; for he fancied that he was making himself sorely
missed by suffering himself to remain shut up and inactive amid the
countless luxuries and enjoyments his hosts lavished upon him as a
knight, and he felt too that he would have to render a strict account to
heaven of that indolence and seclusion; and so one day he asked the duke

ors, and the duke and duchess, too, came out to see
him. sancho was mounted on his dapple, with his alforjas, valise, and
proven, supremely happy because the duke's majordomo, the same that had
acted the part of the trifaldi, had given him a little purse with two
hundred gold crowns to meet the necessary expenses of the road, but of
this don quixote knew nothing as yet. while all were, as has been said,
observing him, suddenly from among the duennas and handmaidens the
impudent and witty altisidora lifted up her voice and said in pathetic
tones:

give ear, cruel knight;
  draw rein; where's the need
of spurring the flanks
  of that ill-broken steed?
from what art thou flying?

all the while the unhappy altisidora was bewailing herself in the above
strain don quixote stood staring at her; and without uttering a word in
reply to her he turned round to sancho and said, "sancho my friend, i
conjure thee by the life of thy forefathers tell me the truth; say, hast
thou by any chance taken the three kerchiefs and the garters this
love-sick maid speaks of?"

to this sancho made answer, "the three kerchiefs i have; but the garters,

"and may god so prosper it, senor don quixote," said the duchess, "that
we may always hear good news of your exploits; god speed you; for the
longer you stay, the more you inflame the hearts of the damsels who
behold you; and as for this one of mine, i will so chastise her that she
will not transgress again, either with her eyes or with her words."

"one word and no more, o valiant don quixote, i ask you to hear," said
altisidora, "and that is that i beg your pardon about the theft of the
garters; for by god and upon my soul i have got them on, and i have
fallen into the same blunder as he did who went looking for his ass being
all the while mounted on it."

"didn't i say so?" said sancho. "i'm a likely one to hide thefts! why if
i wanted to deal in them, opportunities came ready enough to me in my
government."

when don quixote saw himself in open country, free, and relieved from the
attentions of altisidora, he felt at his ease, and in fresh spirits to
take up the pursuit of chivalry once more; and turning to sancho he said,
"freedom, sancho, is one of the most precious gifts that heaven has
bestowed upon men; no treasures that the earth holds buried or the sea
conceals can compare with it; for freedom, as for honour, life may and
should be ventured; and on the other hand, captivity is the greatest evil
that can fall to the lot of man. i say this, sancho, because thou hast

protector, especially in those hard struggles the spaniards had with the
moors; and therefore they invoke and call upon him as their defender in
all their battles; and in these he has been many a time seen beating
down, trampling under foot, destroying and slaughtering the hagarene
squadrons in the sight of all; of which fact i could give thee many
examples recorded in truthful spanish histories."

sancho changed the subject, and said to his master, "i marvel, senor, at
the boldness of altisidora, the duchess's handmaid; he whom they call
love must have cruelly pierced and wounded her; they say he is a little
blind urchin who, though blear-eyed, or more properly speaking sightless,
if he aims at a heart, be it ever so small, hits it and pierces it
through and through with his arrows. i have heard it said too that the
arrows of love are blunted and robbed of their points by maidenly modesty
and reserve; but with this altisidora it seems they are sharpened rather
than blunted."

"bear in mind, sancho," said don quixote, "that love is influenced by no
consideration, recognises no restraints of reason, and is of the same
nature as death, that assails alike the lofty palaces of kings and the
humble cabins of shepherds; and when it takes entire possession of a
heart, the first thing it does is to banish fear and shame from it; and
so without shame altisidora declared her passion, which excited in my
mind embarrassment rather than commiseration."

"notable cruelty!" exclaimed sancho; "unheard-of ingratitude! i can only
say for myself that the very smallest loving word of hers would have
subdued me and made a slave of me. the devil! what a heart of marble,
what bowels of brass, what a soul of mortar! but i can't imagine what it
is that this damsel saw in your worship that could have conquered and
captivated her so. what gallant figure was it,

that lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expecting anything of
the kind, don quixote found himself caught in some nets of green cord
stretched from one tree to another; and unable to conceive what it could
be, he said to sancho, "sancho, it strikes me this affair of these nets
will prove one of the strangest adventures imaginable. may i die if the
enchanters that persecute me are not trying to entangle me in them and
delay my journey, by way of revenge for my obduracy towards altisidora.
well then let me tell them that if these nets, instead of being green
cord, were made of the hardest diamonds, or stronger than that wherewith
the jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshed venus and mars, i would break
them as easily as if they were made of rushes or cotton threads." but

from among some trees two shepherdesses of surpassing beauty presented
themselves to his sight--or at least damsels dressed like shepherde

high praise of the generous disposition of the lacquey tosilos.

"is it possible, sancho," said don quixote, "that thou dost still think
that he yonder is a real lacquey? apparently it has escaped thy memory
that thou hast seen dulcinea turned and transformed into a peasant wench,
and the knight of the mirrors into the bachelor carrasco; all the work of
the enchanters that persecute me. but tell me now, didst thou ask this
tosilos, as thou callest him, what has become of altisidora, did she weep
over my absence, or has she already consigned to oblivion the love
thoughts that used to afflict her when i was present?"

"the thoughts that i had," said sancho, "were not such as to leave time
for asking fool's questions. body o' me, senor! is your worship in a
condition now to inquire into other people's thoughts, above all love

bewailed herself in public; all signs that she adored me; for the wrath

ould have been without any signs, for their
amazement at all they saw held them tongue-tied. and now two persons of
distinction, who were at once recognised by don quixote as his hosts the
duke and duchess, ascended the stage attended by a numerous suite, and
seated themselves on two gorgeous chairs close to the two kings, as they
seemed to be. who would not have been amazed at this? nor was this all,
for don quixote had perceived that the dead body on the catafalque was
that of the fair altisidora. as the duke and duchess mounted the stage
don quixote and sancho rose and made them a profound obeisance, which
they returned by bowing their heads slightly. at this moment an official
crossed over, and approaching sancho threw over him a robe of black
buckram painted all over with flames of fire, and taking off his cap put
upon his head a mitre such as those undergoing the sentence of the holy
office wear; and whispered in his ear that he must not open his lips, or
they would put a gag

t help smiling to see the figure sancho presented.
and now from underneath the catafalque, so it seemed, there rose a low
sweet sound of flutes, which, coming unbroken by human voice (for there
silence itself kept silence), had a soft and languishing effect. then,
beside the pillow of what seemed to be the dead body, suddenly appeared a
fair youth in a roman habit, who, to the accompaniment of a harp which he
himself played, sang in a sweet and clear voice these two stanzas:

while fair altisidora, who the sport

  the dames in sables come to grace the scene,
and while her matrons all in seemly sort

 soul, from this strait prison-house set free,

thy praises singing still shall hold its way,
and make the waters of oblivion stay.

at this point one of the two that looked like kings exclaimed, "enough,
enough, divine singer! it would be an endless task to put before us now
the death and the charms of the peerless altisidora, not dead as the
ignorant world imagines, but living in the voice of fame and in the

to the long-lost light. do thou, therefore, o rhadamanthus, who sittest

rhadamanthus rising up said:

on hearing this sancho broke silence and cried out, "by all that's good,

in fine, all the duennas smacked him and several others of the household
pinched him; but what he could not stand was being pricked by the pins;
and so, apparently out of patience, he started up out of his chair, and
seizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the duennas and the
whole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, "begone, ye ministers of hell;
i'm not made of brass not to feel such out-of-the-way tortures."

at this instant altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so long
lying on her back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanders cried
out almost with one voice, "altisidora is alive! altisidora lives!"

rhadamanthus bade sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had in
view was now attained. when don quixote saw altisidora move, he went on
his knees to sancho saying to him, "now is the time, son of my bowels,
not to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those lashes
thou art bound

to which sancho made answer, "that's trick upon trick, i think, and not
honey upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a whipping to come now,
on the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings! you had better take a
big stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch me into a well; i should
not mind it much, if i'm to be always made the cow of the wedding for the
cure of other people's ailments. leave me alone; or else by god i'll
fling the whole thing to the dogs, let come what may."

altisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she did so
the clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of all
present exclaiming, "long life to altisidora! long life to altisidora!"
the duke and duchess and the kings minos and rhadamanthus stood up, and
all, together with don quixote and sancho, advanced to receive her and
take her down from the catafalque; and she, making as though she were
recovering from a swoon, bowed her head to the duke and duchess and to

 as he still felt the pain of his late
martyrdom, which interfered with his freedom of speech; and it would have
been more to his taste to sleep in a hovel alone, than in that luxurious
chamber in company. and so well founded did his apprehension prove, and
so correct was his anticipation, that scarcely had his master got into
bed when he said, "what dost thou think of tonight's adventure, sancho?
great and mighty is the power of cold-hearted scorn, for thou with thine
own eyes hast seen altisidora slain, not by arrows, nor by the sword, nor
by any warlike weapon, nor by deadly poisons, but by the thought of the
sternness and scorn with which i have always treated her."

"she might have died and welcome," said sancho, "when she pleased and how
she pleased; and she might have left me alone, for i never made her fall
in love or scorned her. i don't know nor can i imagine how the recovery
of altisidora, a damsel more fanciful than wise, can have, as i have said
before, anything to do

hing connected with sancho and don quixote. he had the roads
about the castle far and near, everywhere he thought don quixote was
likely to pass on his return, occupied by large numbers of his servants
on foot and on horseback, who were to bring him to the castle, by fair
means or foul, if they met him. they did meet him, and sent word to the
duke, who, having already settled what was to be done, as soon as he
heard of his arrival, ordered the torches and lamps in the court to be
lit and altisidora to be placed on the catafalque with all the pomp and
ceremony that has been described, the whole affair being so well arranged
and acted that it differed but little from reality. and cide hamete says,
moreover, that for his part he considers the concocters of the joke as
crazy as the victims of it, and that the duke and duchess were not two
fingers' breadth removed from being something like fools themselves when
they took such pains to make game of a pair of fools.

as don quixote fancied, following up the freak of her lord and lady,
entered the chamber, crowned with the garland she had worn on the
catafalque and in a robe of white taffeta embroidered with gold flowers,
her hair flowing loose over her shoulders, and leaning upon a staff of
fine black ebony. don quixote, disconcerted and in confusion at her
appearance, huddled himself up and well-nigh covered himself altogether
with the sheets and counterpane of the bed,

 tongue-tied, and unable to
offer her any civility. altisidora seated herself on a chair at the head
of the bed, and, after a deep sigh, said to him in a feeble, soft voice,
"when women of rank and modest maidens trample honour under foot, and
give a loose to the tongue that breaks through every impediment,
publishing abroad the inmost secrets of their hearts, they are reduced to
sore extremities. such a one am i, senor don quixote of la mancha,
crushed, conquered, love-smitten, but yet patient under suffering and
virtuous, and so much so that my he

this good squire, there i should have remained in the other world."

"love might very well have let it rest upon the sufferings of my ass, and
i should have been obliged to him," said sancho. "but tell me,
senora--and may heaven send you a tenderer lover than my master-what did
you see in the other world? what goes on in hell? for of course that's
where one who dies in despair is bound for."

"to tell you the truth," said altisidora, "i cannot have died outright,
for i did not go into hell; had i gone in, it is very certain i should
never have come out again, do what i might. the truth is, i came to the
gate, where some dozen or so of devils were playing tennis, all in
breeches and doublets, with falling collars trimmed with flemish
bonelace, and ruffles of the same that served them for wristbands, with
four fingers' breadth of the arms exposed to make their hands look
longer; in their hands they held rackets of fir

still more was that books, apparently full of wind and rubbish, served
them for tennis balls, a strange and marvellous thing; this, however, did
not astonish me so much as to observe that, although with players it is
usual for the winners to be glad and the losers sorry, there in that game
all were growling, all were snarling, and all were cursing one another."
"that's no wonder," said sancho; "for devils, whether playing or not, can
never be content, win or lose."

"very likely," said altisidora; "but there is another thing that
surprises me too, i mean surprised me then, and that was that no ball
outlasted the first throw or was of any use a second time; and it was
wonderful the constant succession there was of books, new and old. to one
of them, a brand-new, well-bound one, they gave such a stroke that they
knocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about. 'look what
book that is,' said one devil to another, and the other replied, 'it is

 in the world; this history has been going about here for some
time from hand to hand, but it does not stay long in any, for everybody
gives it a taste of his foot. i am not disturbed by hearing that i am
wandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of the pit or in the
daylight above, for i am not the one that history treats of. if it should
be good, faithful, and true, it will have ages of life; but if it should
be bad, from its birth to its burial will not be a very long journey."

altisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against don quixote,
when he said to her, "i have several times told you, senora that it
grieves me you should have set your affections upon me, as from mine they
can only receive gratitude, but no return. i was born to belong to
dulcinea del toboso, and the fates, if there are any, dedicated me to
her; and to suppose that any other beauty can take the place she occupies
in my heart is to suppose an impossibility. this frank declaration should

ice to make you retire within the bounds of your modesty, for no one
can bind himself to do impossibilities."

hearing this, altisidora, with a show of anger and agitation, exclaimed,
"god's life! don stockfish, soul of a mortar, stone of a date, more
obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when he has his mind
made up, if i fall upon you i'll tear your eyes out! do you fancy, don

seen to-night has been make-believe; i'm not the woman to let the black
of my nail suffer for such a camel, much less die!"

"that i can well believe," said san

 who came in to see him, and with them there followed a long and
delightful conversation, in the course of which sancho said so many droll
and saucy things that he left the duke and duchess wondering not only at
his simplicity but at his sharpness. don quixote begged their permission
to take his departure that same day, inasmuch as for a vanquished knight
like himself it was fitter he should live in a pig-sty than in a royal
palace. they gave it very readily, and the duchess asked him if
altisidora was in his good graces.

he replied, "senora, let me tell your ladyship that this damsel's ailment
comes entirely of idleness, and the cure for it is honest and constant
employment. she herself has told me that lace is worn in hell; and as she
must know how to make it, let it never be out of her hands; for when she
is occupied in shifting the bobbins to and fro, the image or images of
what she loves will not shift to and fro in her thoughts; this is the
truth, this is my opinion, and th

is is my advice."

"and mine," added sancho; "for i never in all my life saw a lace-maker
that died for love; when damsels are at work their minds are more set on
finishing their tasks than on thinking of their loves. i speak from my
own experience; for when i'm digging i never think of my old woman; i
mean my teresa panza, whom i love better than my own eyelids." "you say
well, sancho," said the duchess, "and i will take care that my altisidora
employs herself henceforward in needlework of some sort; for she is
extremely expert at it." "there is no occasion to have recourse to that
remedy, senora," said altisidora; "for the mere thought of the cruelty
with which this vagabond villain has treated me will suffice to blot him
out of my memory without any other device; with your highness's leave i
will retire, not to have before my eyes, i won't say his rueful
countenance, but his abominable, ugly looks." "that reminds me of the

ommon saying, that 'he that rails is ready to forgive,'" said the duke.

altisidora then, pretending to wipe away her tears with a handkerchief,
made an obeisance to her master and mistress and quitted the room.

"ill luck betide thee, poor damsel," said sancho, "ill luck betide thee!
thou hast fallen in with a soul as dry as a rush and a heart as hard as
oak; had it been me, i'faith 'another cock would have crowed to thee.'"

so the conversation came to an end, and don quixote dressed himself and
dined with the duke and duchess, and set out the same evening.

of what passed between don quixote and his squire sancho on the way to
their village


the vanquished and afflicted don quixote went along very downcast in one
respect and very happy in another. his sadness arose from his defeat, and
his satisfaction from the thought of the virtue that lay in sancho, as
had been proved by the resurrection of altisidora; though it was with
difficulty he could persuade himself that the love-smitten damsel had
been really dead. sancho went along anything but cheerful, for it grieved
him that altisidora had not kept her promise of giving him the smocks;
and turning this over in his mind he said to his master, "surely, senor,
i'm the most unlucky doctor in the world; there's many a physician that,
after killing the sick man he had to cure, requires to be paid for his
work, though it is only signing a bit of

pinproddings, and whippings, nobody gives me a farthing. well, i swear by
all that's good if they put another patient into my hands, they'll have
to grease them for me before i cure him; for, as they say, 'it's by his
singing the abbot gets his dinner,' and i'm not going to believe that
heaven has bestowed upon me the virtue i have, that i should be dealing
it out to others all for nothing."

"thou art right, sancho my friend," said don quixote, "and altisidora has
behaved very badly in not giving thee the smocks she promised; and
although that virtue of thine is gratis data--as it has cost thee no
study whatever, any more than such study as thy personal sufferings may
be--i can say for myself that if thou wouldst have payment for the lashes
on account of the disenchant of dulcinea, i would have given it to thee
freely ere this. i am not sure, however, whether payment will comport
with the cure, and i would not have the reward interfere with th

village."

the sportsmen came up and asked for their hare, which don quixote gave
them. they then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the town
they came upon the curate and the bachelor samson carrasco busy with
their breviaries. it should be mentioned that sancho had thrown, by way
of a sumpter-cloth, over dapple and over the bundle of armour, the
buckram robe painted with flames which they had put upon him at the
duke's castle the night altisidora came back to life. he had also fixed
the mitre on dapple's head, the oddest transformation and decoration that
ever ass in the world underwent. they were at once recognised by both the
curate and the bachelor, who came towards them with open arms. don
quixote dismounted and received them with a close embrace; and the boys,
who are lynxes that nothing escapes, spied out the ass's mitre and came
running to see it, calling out to one another, "come here, boys, and see
