[CHARACTER]
old professor [CHARACTER] is an experienced, competent
man, but due to the unfortunately unskilled manner in which stoker
renders [CHARACTER]'s speech, he often comes across as somewhat
bumbling. nevertheless, [CHARACTER] emerges as a well-matched adversary
to the count, and he is initially the only character who possesses
a mind open enough to contemplate and address dracula's particular
brand of evil. 
a doctor, philosopher, and metaphysician, [CHARACTER]
arrives on the scene versed not only in the modern methods of western medicine,
but with an unparalleled knowledge of superstitions and folk remedies.
he straddles two distinct worlds, the old and the new: the first
marked by fearful respect for tradition, the second by ever-progressing
modernity. unlike his former pupil, dr. seward, whose obsession
with modern techniques blinds him to the real nature of lucy's sickness,
[CHARACTER] not only diagnoses the young girl's affliction correctly,
but offers her the only opportunity for a cure.
like many of the other characters, [CHARACTER] is relatively static,
as he undergoes no great change or development throughout the course
of the novel. having helped rid the earth of the count's evil, he
departs as he arrived: morally righteous and religiously committed.
[CHARACTER] views his pursuit of dracula with an air of grandiosity.
he envisions his band as "ministers of god's own wish," and assures
his comrades that "we go out as the old knights of the cross to
redeem more." hyperbole aside, stoker portrays [CHARACTER] as the
embodiment of unswerving good, the hero he recruits "to set the
world free."
