Philosopher-king - 
 The philosopher-king is the ruler of the kallipolis.
Also called guardians, philosopher-kings are the only people who
can grasp the Forms, and thus the only people who can claim actual
knowledge. Since the philosopher-king yearns after truth above all
else, he is also the most just man.
