s flat, that the english are the lost ten tribes of
israel, and that the united states is a democracy.

at that moment the steel and cement town which composed the factory of
the pullmore tractor company of zenith was running on night shift to
fill an order of tractors for the polish army. it hummed like a million
bees, glared through its wide windows like a volcano. along the high
wire fences, searchlights played on cinder-lined yards, switch-tracks,
and armed guards on patrol.

at that moment mike monday was finishing a meeting. mr. monday, the
distinguished evangelist, the best-known protestant pontiff in america,
had once been a prize-fighter. satan had not dealt justly with him. as
a prize-fighter he gained nothing but his crooked nose, his celebrated
vocabulary, and his stage-presence. the service of the lord had been
more profitable. he was about to retire with a fortune. it had been well
earned, for, to quote his last report, "rev. mr. monday, the prophet
with a punch, has shown that he i

s the world's greatest salesman of
salvation, and that by efficient organization the overhead of spiritual
regeneration may be kept down to an unprecedented rock-bottom basis. he
has converted over two hundred thousand lost and priceless souls at an
average cost of less than ten dollars a head."

of the larger cities of the land, only zenith had hesitated to submit
its vices to mike monday and his expert reclamation corps. the more
enterprising organizations of the city had voted to invite him--mr.
george f. babbitt had once praised him in a speech at the boosters'
club. but there was opposition from certain episcopalian and
congregationalist ministers, those renegades whom mr. monday so finely
called "a bunch of gospel-pushers with dish-water instead of blood, a
gang of squealers that need more dust on the knees of their pants and
more hair on their skinny old chests." this oppo

sition had been
crushed when the secretary of the chamber of commerce had reported to a
committee of manufacturers that in every city where he had appeared, mr.
monday had turned the minds of workmen from wages and hours to higher
things, and thus averted strikes. he was immediately invited.

an expense fund of forty thousand dollars had been underwritten; out on
the county fair grounds a mike monday tabernacle had been erected,
to seat fifteen thousand people. in it the prophet was at this moment
concluding his message:

"there's a lot of smart college professors and tea-guzzling slobs in
this burg that say i'm a roughneck and a never-wuzzer and my knowledge
of history is not-yet. oh, there's a gang of woolly-whiskered book-lice
that think they know more than almighty god, and prefer a lot of hun
science and smutty german criticism to the straight and simple word
of god. oh, there's a swel

their filthy mouths and yip that mike monday is vulgar and full of mush.
those pups are saying now that i hog the gospel-show, that i'm in it
for the coin. well, now listen, folks! i'm going to give those birds a
chance! they can stand right up here and tell me to my face that i'm a
galoot and a liar and a hick! only if they do--if they do!--don't faint
with surprise if some of those rum-dumm liars get one good swift poke
from mike, with all the kick of god's flaming righteousness behind the
wallop! well, come on, folks! who says it? who

sense value of christianity," which were printed in bold type surrounded
by a wiggly border. he often said that he was "proud to be known as
primarily a business man" and that he certainly was not going to "permit
the old satan to monopolize all the pep and punch." he was a thin,
rustic-faced young man with gold spectacles and a bang of dull brown
hair, but when he hurled himself into oratory he glowed with power.
he admitted that he was too much the scholar and poet to imitate the
evangelist, mike monday, yet he had once awakened his fold to new life,
and to larger collections, by the challenge, "my brethren, the real
cheap skate is the man who won't lend to the lord!"

he had made his church a true community center. it contained everything
but a bar. it had a nursery, a thursday evening supper with a short
bright missionary lecture afterward, a gymnasium, a fortnightly
motion-picture show, a library of technical books for young
workmen--though, unfortunately, no young workman ever entered the
