in front of the united cigar store this evening the men were gathered to burn 
dirigibles, sink battleships, blow up dynamite works and, all in all, savor the very bacteria 
in their porcelain mouths that would someday stop them cold. clouds of annihilation 
loomed and blew away in their cigar smoke about a nervous figure who could be seen 
dimly listening to the sound of shovels and spades and the intonations of "ashes to 
ashes, dust to dust." this figure was that of leo auffmann, the town jeweler, who, 
widening his large liquid-dark eyes, at last threw up his childlike hands and cried out in 
dismay. 

"stop! in god's name, get out of that graveyard!" 

"lee, how right you are," said grandfather spaulding, passing on his nightly stroll with 
his grandsons douglas and tom. "but, lee, only you can shut these doom-talkers up 1

"sure," said douglas, "invent us a happiness machine!" 
the men laughed. 

"don't," said leo auffmann. "how have we used machines so far, to make people cry? 
yes! every time man and the machine look like they will get on all right— boom! someone 
adds a cog, airplanes drop bombs on us, cars run us off cliffs. so is the boy wrong to 
ask? no! no . . ."

his voice faded as leo auffmann moved to the curb to touch his bicycle as if it were an 
animal. 

"what can i lose?" he murmured. "a little skin off my fingers, a few pounds of metal, 
some sleep? i'll do it, so help me!" 

"lee," said grandfather, "we didn't mean—" 

but leo auffmann was gone, pedaling off through the warm summer evening, his 
voice drifting back. . .i'll do it . . ." 

"you know," said tom, in awe, "i bet he will." 



watching him cycle the brick streets of evening, you could see that leo auffmann was

"what's the other?" 

"the ravine at night don't belong in mr. auffmann's happiness machine, if he ever 
builds it." 

douglas considered this awhile. "you can say that again." 

they stopped talking. listening, suddenly they heard footsteps coming down the 
street, under the trees, outside the house now, on the sidewalk. from her bed mother 
called quietly, "that's your father." it was.

late at night on the bent parch leo auffmann wrote a list he could not see in the dark, 
exclaiming, "ah!" or, "that's another!" when he hit upon a fine component. then the 
front-door screen made a moth sound, tapping. 

"lena?" he whispered. 

she sat down next to him on the swing, in her nightgown, not slim the way girls get 
when they are not loved at seventeen, not fat the way women get when they are not 
loved at fifty, but absolutely right, a roundness, a firmness, the way women are at any 
age, he thought, when there is no questio

he leaned out the window and gaped. "why, it's bill. bill forrester, you there! has the 
sun got you? you're cutting the lawn again!" 

bill looked up, smiled a white smile, and waved. "i know! i think i missed a few 
spots!" 

and while grandpa lay in bed for the next five minutes, smiling and at ease, bill 
forrester cut the lawn north, then west, then south, and finally, in a great green spraying 
fountain, toward the east. 



on sunday morning leo auffmann moved slowly through his garage, expecting some 
wood, a curl of wire, a hammer or wrench to leap up crying, "start here!" but nothing 
leaped, nothing cried for a beginning. 

should a happiness machine, he wondered, be something you can carry in your 
pocket? 

or, he went on, should it be something that carries you in its pocket? 

"one thing i absolutely know," he said aloud. "it should be bright!" 

he set a can of orange paint in the center of the workbench, picked up a dictionary,

lena auffmann froze. she sniffed the air. 

"oh, my god, look what you done!" 

she yanked the oven door open. a great cloud of smoke poured through the kitchen. 

"happiness!" she wailed. "and for the first time in six months we have a fight! 
happiness, and for the first time in twenty years it's not bread, it's charcoal for supper!" 

when the smoke cleared, leo auffmann was gone. 



the fearful clangor, the collision of man and inspiration, the flinging about of metal, 
lumber, hammer, nails, t square, screwdriver, continued for many days. on occasion, 
defeated, leo auffmann loitered out through the streets, nervous, apprehensive, jerking 
his head at the slightest sound of distant laughter, listened to children's jokes, watching 
what made them smile. at night he sat on neighbors' crowded porches, listening to the 
old folks weigh and balance life, and at e

quickened like a general who has seen the forces of darkness routed and whose strategy 
has been reaffirmed. on his way home he felt triumphant until he was in his garage with 
the dead tools and the inanimate lumber. then his bright face fell away in a pale funk, 
and to cover his sense of failure he banged and crashed the parts of his machine about 
as if they really did make sense. at last it began to shape itself and at the end of the ten 
days and nights, trembling with fatigue, self-dedi

the children, who had been screaming horribly at each other, fell silent, as if the red 
death had entered at the chiming of the clock. 

"the happiness machine," husked leo auffmann, "is ready."

"lee auffmann," said his wife, "has lost fifteen pounds. he hasn't talked to his children 
in two weeks, they are nervous, they fight, listen! his wife is nervous, she's gained ten

but leo auffmann was too busy noticing that the room was falling swiftly up. 
how interesting, he thought, lying on the floor. 

darkness closed in a great wink on him as someone screamed something about that 
happiness machine, three times. 



the first thing he noticed the next morning was dozens of birds fluttering around in 
the air stirring up ripples like colored stones thrown into an incredibly clear stream, 
gonging the tin roof of the garage softly. 

a pack of multibred dogs pawfooted one by one into

 the yard to peer and whine gently

and then edged along under the cherry trees. 

leo auffmann, listening, knew what it was that had reached out and called them all 
into the yard. 

the sound of the happiness machine. 

it was the sort of sound that might be heard coming from a giant's kitchen on a 
summer day. there were all kinds of hummings, low and high, steady and then changing. 
incredible foods were being baked there by a host of whirring golden bees as big as 
teacups. the giantess herself, humming contentedly under her breath, might glide to the 
door, as vast as all summer, he

saul, standing in the yard below, looked up. 

"saul, did you turn it on?" 

"you told me to warm it up half an hour ago!" 

"all right, saul, i forgot. i'm not awake." he fell back in bed. 

his wife, bringing his breakfast up, paused by the window, looking down at the 
garage. 

"tell me," she said quietly. "if that machine is like you say, has it got an answer to

s not how it's built!" 

"i'm sorry. i got no time to look, then." 

and she kissed his cheek and went from the room and he lay smelling the wind that 
blew from the hidden machine below, rich with the odor of those roasted chestnuts that 
sold in the autumn streets of a paris he had never known . . . 

a cat moved unseen among the hypnotized dogs and boys to purr against the garage 
door, in the sound of snow-waves crumbling down a faraway and rhythmically breathing 
shore. 

tomorrow, thought leo auffmann, we'll try the machine, all of us, together. 



late that night he awoke and knew something had wakened him. far away in another 
room he heard someone crying. "saul?" he whispered, getting out of bed. 

in his room saul wept, his head buried in his pillow. "no . . .no . . ." he sobbed. 
"over . . . over ..."

and sitting there on the boy's bed, leo auffmann suddenl

l was here tonight. 

why? was saul unhappy, in need of the machine? no, happy, but wanting to hold onto 
happiness always. could you blame a boy wise enough to know his position who tried to 
keep it that way? no! and yet . . . 

above, quite suddenly, something white was exhaled from saul's window. leo 
auffmann's heart thundered. then he realized the window curtain had blown out into the 
open night. but it had seemed as intimate and shimmering a thing as a boy's soul 
escaping his room. and leo auffmann had flung up his hands as if to thwart it, push it 
back into the sleeping house. 

cold, shivering, he moved back into the house and up to saul's room where he seized 
the blowing curtain in and locked the window tight so the pale thing could not escape 
again. then he sat on the bed and put his hand on saul's back. 



a tale of two cities? mine. the old curiosity shop? ha, that's leo auffmann's all right! 
great expectations? that used to be mine. but let great expectations be his, now!"

curiosity shop. in all these books, no mad scientist lives like leo auffmann, none!" 

"you're leaving, and you haven't even tried the machine!" he protested. "try it once,

"tom swift and his electric annihilator— whose is that?" she asked. "must i guess?"

nightmares to innocent sons!" 

silently leo auffmann led his wife into the twilight. she stood before the eight-foot- 
tall, orange-colored box. 

"that's happiness?" she said. "which button do i press to be overjoyed, grateful, 
contented, and much-obliged?" 

the children had gathered now. 

"mama," said saul, "don't!" 

"i got to know what i'm yelling about, saul." she got in the machine, sat down, and 
looked out at her husband, shaking her head. "it's not me needs this, it's you, a nervous 
wreck, shouting." 

"please," he said, "you'll see!

he shut the door. 

"press the button!" he shouted in at his unseen wife. 

there was a click. the machine shivered quietly, like a huge dog dreaming in its sleep. 
"papa!" said saul, worried. 
"listen!" said leo auffmann. 

at first there was nothing but the tremor of the machine's own secretly moving cogs 
and wheels. 

"is mama all right?" asked naomi. 

"all right, she's fine! there, now . . . there!" 

and inside the machine lena auffmann could be heard saying, "oh!" and then again, 
"ah!" in a startled voice. "look at that!" said his hidden wife. "paris!" and later, "london! 
there goes rome! the pyramids! the sphinx!" "the sphinx, you hear, children?" leo

"only thinks she's dancing" the father confided to the world. 

"amazing!" said the unseen woman. 

leo auffmann blushed. "what an understanding wife." 

and then inside the happiness machine, lena auffmann began to weep. 

the inventor's smile faded. 

"she's crying" said naomi. 

"she can't be!" 

"she is," said saul. 

"she simply can't be crying!" leo auffmann, blinking, pressed his ear to the machine.

his wife nodded. "we'll wait, lee." 

he shut the door. in the warm darkness he hesitated, pressed the button, and was 
just relaxing back in color and music, when he heard someone screaming. 

"fire, papa! the machine's on fire!" 

someone hammered the door. he leaped up, bumped his head, and fell as the door 
gave way and the boys dragged him out. behind him he heard a muffled explosion. the 
entire family was running now. leo auffmann turned and gasped, "saul, call the fire 
department!" 

lena auffmann caught saul as he ran. "saul," she said. "wait." 

there was a gush of flame, another muffled explosion. when the machine was burning 
very well indeed, lena auffmann nodded. 

"all right, saul," she said. "run call the fire department."

front, proud of how fine the flames looked jumping from the garage roof. 

grandfather spaulding studied the smoke ball in the sky and said, quietly, "lee, was 
that it? your happiness machine?" 

"some year," said leo auffmann "i'll figure it and tell you." 

lena auffmann, standing in the dark now, watched as the firemen ran in and out of 
the yard; the garage, roaring, settled upon itself. 

"leo," she said, "it won't take a year to figure. look around. think. keep quiet a little 
bit. then come tell me. i'll be in the house, putting books back on shelves, and clothes 
back in closets, fixing supper, supper's late, look how dark. come, children, help mama."

the firemen and the neighbors were gone leo auffmann was left with 
grandfather spaulding and douglas and tom, brooding over the smoldering ruin. he 
stirred his foot in the wet ashes and slowly said what he had to say. 

"the first thing you learn in life is you're a fool. the last thing you learn in life is you're 
the same fool. in one hour, i've done a lot of thinking. i thought, leo auffmann is 
blind! . . .you want to see the real happiness machine? the one they patented a couple 
thousand years ago, it still runs, not good all the time, no! but it runs. it's been here all 
along." 

"but the fire—" said douglas. 

"sure, the fire, the garage! but like lena said, it don't take a year to figure; what 
burned in the garage don't count!" they followed him up the front-porch steps. 

"here," whispered leo auffmann, "the front window. quiet, and you'll see it."

through the window, the pink light on his cheeks. 

"sure," he murmured. "there it is." and he watched with now-gentle sorrow and now- 
quick delight, and at last quiet acceptance as all the bits and pieces of this house mixed, 
stirred, settled, poised, and ran steadily again. "the happiness machine," he said. "the

the small gyroscope he often felt inside himself tilting toward the sun every time the 
earth tilted toward outer space and darkness. but no, there was auffmann's folly, ashes
