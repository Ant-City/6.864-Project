 for coachmen's liveries. then it would take a turn at embossed
tin lids for candy boxes. the fact is that the poor old gentleman, with
his weak and fluttering heart, didn't want his factory to manufacture
anything at all. he wanted to retire. and he did retire when he was
seventy. but he was so worried at having all the street boys in the town
point after him and exclaim: "there goes the laziest man in waterbury!"
that he tried taking a tour round the world. and florence and a young
man called jimmy went with him. it appears from what florence told me
that jimmy's function with mr hurlbird was to avoid exciting topics for
him. he had to keep him, for instance, out of political discussions. for
the poor old man was a violent democrat in days when you might travel
the world over without finding anything but a republican. anyhow, they
went round the world.

i think an anecdote is about the best way to give you an idea of what
the old gentleman was like. for it is perhaps important that you sh

altogether merciless proceedings on the
part of a cruel providence that we call a coincidence. because it may
just as well have been the superstitious mind of florence that forced
her to certain acts, as if she had been hypnotized. it is, however,
certain that the 4th of august always proved a significant date for her.
to begin with, she was born on the 4th of august. then, on that date, in
the year 1899, she set out with her uncle for the tour round the world
in company with a young man called jimmy. but that was not merely a
coincidence. her kindly old uncle, with the supposedly damaged heart,
was in his delicate way, offering her, in this trip, a birthday present
to celebrate her coming of age. then, on the 4th of august, 1900, she
yielded to an action that certainly coloured her whole life--as well
as mine. she had no luck. she was probably offering herself a birthday
present that morning.... on the 4th of august, 1901, she married me, and
set sail for europe in a great gale of wind--th

husband would he one who could get her received at the british
court. she had spent, it seemed, two months in great britain--seven
weeks in touring from stratford to strathpeffer, and one as paying
guest in an old english family near ledbury, an impoverished, but still
stately family, called bagshawe. they were to have spent two months
more in that tranquil bosom, but inopportune events, apparently in her
uncle's business, had caused their rather hurried return to stamford.
the young man called jimmy had remained in europe to perfect his
knowledge of that continent. he certainly did: he was most useful to us
afterwards.

but the point that came out--that there was no mistaking--was that
florence was coldly and calmly determined to take no look at any man who
could not give her a european settlement. her glimpse of english home
life had effected this. she meant, on her marriage, to have a year
in paris, and then to have her husband buy some real estate in the
neighbourhood of fordingbridge,

they would not want to have to suggest that a husband must
not kiss the back of his wife's neck. they would not like to suggest
that he might, for the matter of that. i wonder, though, how florence
got the doctor to enter the conspiracy--the several doctors.

of course her heart squeaked a bit--she had the same configuration of
the lungs as her uncle hurlbird. and, in his company, she must have
heard a great deal of heart talk from specialists. anyhow, she and they
tied me pretty well down--and jimmy, of course, that dreary boy--what in
the world did she see in him? he was lugubrious, silent, morose. he had
no talent as a painter. he was very sallow and dark, and he never shaved
sufficiently. he met us at havre, and he proceeded to make himself
useful for the next two years, during which he lived in our flat in
paris, whether we were there or not. he studied painting at julien's, or
some such place....

that fellow had his hands always in the pockets of his odious,
square-shouldered, broad-

verdict: "better not, then." i
daresay they were honest enough, as things go. they probably imagined
that the mere associations of the steamer might have effects on
florence's nerves. that would be enough, that and a conscientious desire
to keep our money on the continent.

it must have rattled poor florence pretty considerably, for you see, the
main idea--the only main idea of her heart, that was otherwise cold--was
to get to fordingbridge and be a county lady in the home of her
ancestors. but jimmy got her, there: he shut on her the door of the
channel; even on the fairest day of blue sky, with the cliffs of england
shining like mother of pearl in full view of calais, i would not have
let her cross the steamer gangway to save her life. i tell you it fixed
her.

it fixed her beautifully, because she could not announce herself
as cured, since that would have put an end to the locked bedroom
arrangements. and, by the time she was sick of jimmy--which happened in
the year 1903--she had taken

fe, she could at least have pretty considerably
queened it there or thereabouts, what with our money and the support of
the ashburnhams. her uncle, as soon as he considered that she had really
settled down with me--and i sent him only the most glowing accounts of
her virtue and constancy--made over to her a very considerable part of
his fortune for which he had no use. i suppose that we had, between us,
fifteen thousand a year in english money, though i never quite knew
how much of hers went to jimmy. at any rate, we could have shone in
fordingbridge. i never quite knew, either, how she and edward got rid
of jimmy. i fancy that fat and disreputable raven must have had his six
golden front teeth knocked down his throat by edward one morning whilst
i had gone out to buy some flowers in the rue de la paix, leaving
florence and the flat in charge of those two. and serve him very right,
is all that i can say. he was a bad sort of blackmailer; i hope florence
does not have his company in the next

had been given a thin-shelled pullet's egg to carry on my palm from
equatorial africa to hoboken. yes, she became for me, as it were, the
subject of a bet--the trophy of an athlete's achievement, a parsley
crown that is the symbol of his chastity, his soberness, his
abstentions, and of his inflexible will. of intrinsic value as a wife,
i think she had none at all for me. i fancy i was not even proud of the
way she dressed.

but her passion for jimmy was not even a passion, and, mad as the
suggestion may appear, she was frightened for her life. yes, she was
afraid of me. i will tell you how that happened. i had, in the old days,
a darky servant, called julius, who valeted me, and waited on me, and
loved me, like the crown of his head. now, when we left waterbury to go
to the "pocahontas", florence entrusted to me one very special and very
precious leather grip. she told me that her life might depend on that
grip, which contained her drugs a

t that was an unusual record for
people who had been so much together. you are not to imagine that it was
only at nauheim that we met. that would not have suited florence.

i find, on looking at my diaries, that on the 4th of september, 1904,
edward accompanied florence and myself to paris, where we put him up
till the twenty-first of that month. he made another short visit to us
in december of that year--the first year of our acquaintance. it must
have been during this visit that he knocked mr jimmy's teeth down his
throat. i daresay florence had asked him to come over for that purpose.
in 1905 he was in paris three times--once with leonora, who wanted some
frocks. in 1906 we spent the best part of six weeks together at mentone,
and edward stayed with us in paris on his way back to london. that was
how it went.

the fact was that in florence the poor wretch had got hold of a tartar,
compared with whom leonora was a sucking kid. he must have had a hell of
a time. leonora wanted to keep him

ened her lips. she saw the
man who was talking to me. she stuck her hands over her face as if she
wished to push her eyes out. and she was not there any more.

i could not move; i could not stir a finger. and then that man said:

"by jove: florry hurlbird." he turned upon me with an oily and uneasy
sound meant for a laugh. he was really going to ingratiate himself with
me. "do you know who that is?" he asked. "the last time i saw that girl
she was coming out of the bedroom of a young man called jimmy at five
o'clock in the morning. in my house at ledbury. you saw her recognize
me." he was standing on his feet, looking down at me. i don't know what
i looked like. at any rate, he gave a sort of gurgle and then stuttered:

"oh, i say...." those were the last words i ever heard of mr bagshawe's.
a long time afterwards i pulled myself out of the lounge and went up to
florence's room. she had not locked the door--for the first time of
our married life. she was lying, quite respectably arranged, u

el with that pallid face and the hand
clutching her dress over her heart. it can't have been only bagshawe.
her face was contorted with agony before ever her eyes fell upon me
or upon him beside me. but i dare say bagshawe may have been the
determining influence in her suicide. leonora says that she had that
flask, apparently of nitrate of amyl, but actually of prussic acid, for
many years and that she was determined to use it if ever i discovered
the nature of her relationship with that fellow jimmy. you see, the
mainspring of her nature must have been vanity. there is no reason why
it shouldn't have been; i guess it is vanity that makes most of us keep
straight, if we do keep straight, in this world.

if it had been merely a matter of edward's relations with the girl i
dare say florence would have faced it out. she would no doubt have made
him scenes, have threatened him, have appealed to his sense of humour,
to his promises. but mr bagshawe and the fact that the date was the 4th

 florence had discovered this secret of mine i should
have found her knowledge of it so unbearable that i never could have
supported all the other privations of the régime that she extracted from
me. i am bound to say that florence never discovered this secret.

certainly she never alluded to it; i dare say she never took sufficient
interest in me.

and the secret weakness of florence--the weakness that she could not
bear to have me discover, was just that early escapade with the fellow
called jimmy. let me, as this is in all probability the last time i
shall mention florence's name, dwell a little upon the change that had
taken place in her psychology. she would not, i mean, have minded if i
had discovered that she was the mistress of edward ashburnham. she would
rather have liked it. indeed, the chief trouble of poor leonora in those
days was to keep florence from making, before me, theatrical displays,
on one line or another, of that very fact. she wanted, in one mood,
to come rushing t

en of whom history tells us. in another mood she would desire to come
to me disdainfully and to tell me that i was considerably less than a
man and that what had happened was what must happen when a real male
came along. she wanted to say that in cool, balanced and sarcastic
sentences. that was when she wished to appear like the heroine of a
french comedy. because of course she was always play acting.

but what she didn't want me to know was the fact of her first escapade
with the fellow called jimmy. she had arrived at figuring out the sort
of low-down bowery tough that that fellow was. do you know what it is to
shudder, in later life, for some small, stupid action--usually for some
small, quite genuine piece of emotionalism--of your early life? well, it
was that sort of shuddering that came over florence at the thought that
she had surrendered to such a low fellow. i don't know that she need
have shuddered. it was her footling old uncle's work; he ought never to
have taken those two round

 the world together and shut himself up in his
cabin for the greater part of the time. anyhow, i am convinced that the
sight of mr bagshawe and the thought that mr bagshawe--for she knew that
unpleasant and toadlike personality--the thought that mr bagshawe would
almost certainly reveal to me that he had caught her coming out of
jimmy's bedroom at five o'clock in the morning on the 4th of august,
1900--that was the determining influence in her suicide. and no doubt
the effect of the date was too much for her superstitious personality.
she had been born on the 4th of august; she had started to go round the
world on the 4th of august; she had become a low fellow's mistress on
the 4th of august. on the same day of the year she had married me; on
that 4th she had lost edward's love, and bagshawe had appeared like a

 detestable
to her, because she so detested florence. and florence talked....

that was what was terrible, because florence forced leonora herself to
abandon her high reserve--florence and the situation. it appears that
florence was in two minds whether to confess to me or to leonora.
confess she had to. and she pitched at last on leonora, because if it
had been me she would have had to confess a great deal more. or, at
least, i might have guessed a great deal more, about her "heart",
and about jimmy. so she went to leonora one day and began hinting and
hinting. and she enraged leonora to such an extent that at last leonora
said:

"you want to tell me that you are edward's mistress. you can be. i have
no use for him." that was really a calamity for leonora, because, once
started, there was no stopping the talking. she tried to stop--but
it was not to be done. she found it necessary to send edward messages
through florence; for she would not speak to him. she had to give him,
for instance, t

and, as i have never heard yet from the misses hurlbird, i rather
think that miss hurlbird, either by revelations or by moral force, has
persuaded miss florence that no memorial to their names shall be erected
in the city of waterbury, conn. miss hurlbird wept dreadfully when she
heard that i was going to stay with the ashburnhams, but she did not
make any comments. i was aware, at that date, that her niece had been
seduced by that fellow jimmy before i had married her--but i contrived
to produce on her the impression that i thought florence had been a
model wife. why, at that date i still believed that florence had been
perfectly virtuous after her marriage to me. i had not figured it out
that she could have played it so low down as to continue her intrigue
with that fellow under my roof. well, i was a fool. but i did not think
much about florence at that date. my mind was occupied with what was
happening at branshaw. i had got it in
