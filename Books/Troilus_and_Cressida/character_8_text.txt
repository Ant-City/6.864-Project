  pandarus. asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
    porridge after meat! i could live and die in the eyes of troilus.
    ne'er look, ne'er look; the eagles are gone. crows and daws,
    crows and daws! i had rather be such a man as troilus than
    agamemnon and all greece.
  cressida. there is amongst the greeks achilles, a better man than
    troilus.
  pandarus. achilles? a drayman, a porter, a very camel!
  cressida. well, well.
  pandarus. well, well! why, have you any discretion? have you any
    eyes? do you know what a man is? is not birth, beauty, good
    shape, discourse, manhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth,
    liberality, and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?

    what grief hath set these jaundies o'er your cheeks?
    the ample proposition that hope makes
    in all designs begun on earth below
    fails in the promis'd largeness; checks and disasters
    grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
    as knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
    infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain
    tortive and errant from his course of

    in fortune's love? for then the bold and coward,
    the wise and fool, the artist and unread,
    the hard and soft, seem all affin'd and kin.
    but in the wind and tempest of her frown
    distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
    puffing at all, winnows the light away;
    and what hath mass or matter by itself
    lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
  nestor. with due observance of thy godlike seat,
    great agamemnon, nestor shall apply
    thy latest words. in the reproof of chance
    lies the true proof of men. the sea being smooth,
    how many shallow bauble boats dare sail
    upon her patient breast, making their way
    with those of nobler bulk!
    but let the ruffian boreas once enrage
    the gentle thetis, and anon behold
    the strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
    bounding between the two moist elements
    like perseus' horse. where's then the saucy boat,

    'tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar'd,
    which, from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp'd,
    would seem hyperboles. at this fusty stuff
    the large achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,

    they call this bed-work, mapp'ry, closet-war;
    so that the ram that batters down the wall,
    for the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,
    they place before his hand that made the engine,
    or those that with the fineness of their souls
    by reason guide his execution.
