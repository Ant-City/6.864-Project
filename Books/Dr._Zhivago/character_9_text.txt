they stayed about a month at the montenegro before moving into the small three-room apartment adjoining the workshop.
   this was the most disreputable part of moscowslums, cheap bars frequented by cabmen,1 whole streets devoted to vice, dens of fallen women.

   their mother was a living example of this fear. madame guishar was a plump blonde of about thirty-five subject to spells of palpitation alternating with her fits of silliness. she was a dreadful coward and was terrified of men. for this very reason, out of fear and confusion

the workshop was in a one-story house near the corner of tverskaia street. near by was the brest railway with its engine depots, warehouses, and lodgings for the employees.
   in one of them lived olia demina, a clever girl who worked at madame guishars and whose uncle was employed at the freight yard.
   she was a quick apprentice. she had been singled out by the former owner of the workshop and was now beginning to be favored by the new one. olia had a great liking for lara guishar.
   nothing had changed since levitskaias day. the sewing machines whirred frantically under the tread of tired seamstresses or their flitting hands. here and there a woman sat on a table sewing quietly with a broad sweep of the arm as she pulled the needle and long thread. the floor was littered with scraps. you had to raise your voice to make yourself heard above the clatter of the machines and the modulated trills of kirill modestovich, the canary in its cage in the window (the forme

   an object of even greater hatred was his bulldog jack; he sometimes took it with him on a lead on which it pulled with such violent jerks that komarovsky followed stumbling and lurching with outstretched hands like a blind man after his guide.
   one spring day jack sank his teeth in laras leg and tore her stocking.
   ill kill that demon, olia whispered hoarsely into laras ear.
   yes, it really is a horrid dog; but how can you do that, silly?

   lara was only a little over sixteen but she was well developed. people thought she was eighteen or more. she had a good mind and was easy to get along with. she was very good-looking.
   she and rodia realized that nothing in life would come to them without a struggle. unlike the idle and well-to-do, they did not have the leisure for premature curiosity and theorizing about things that were not yet practical concerns. only the superfluous is sordid. lara was the purest being in the world.

   the workshop was quiet. the window looking out on the street was open. lara heard the rattle of a droshki in the distance turn into a smooth glide as the wheels left the cobbles for the groove of a trolley track. ill sleep a bit more, she thought. the rumble of the town was like a lullaby and made her sleepy.
   lara felt her size and her position in the bed with two points of her bodythe salient of her left shoulder and the big toe of her right foot. everything else was more or less herself, her soul or inner being, harmoniously fitted into her contours and impatiently straining toward the future.

the weather was on the mend. plop-plop-plop went the water drops on the metal of the drainpipes and the cornices, roof tapping messages to roof as if it were spring. it was thawing.
   lara walked all the way in a daze and realized what had happened to her only when she reached home.
   everyone was asleep. she fell back into her trance and in this abstracted state sat down at her mothers dressing table, still in her pale mauve, almost white, lace-trimmed dress and long veil borrowed for the evening from the workshop, like a costume. she sat before her reflection in the mirror, and saw nothing. then, folding her arms, she put them on the dressing table and buried her head in them.

   some day, many, many years later, when it would be possible, lara would tell olia demina, and olia would hug her and burst into tears.
   outside the window the water drops plopped on and on, the thaw muttered its spells. down the road someone was banging on a neighbors door. lara did not raise her head. her shoulders quivered. she was weeping.

   nothing equalled her spiritual beauty. her hands were stunning like a sublime idea. her shadow on the wall of the hotel room was like the outline of her innocence. her slip was stretched over her breast, as firmly and simply as linen on an embroidery frame.
   his fingers drummed on the windowpane in time to the unhurried thud of horses hoofs on the asphalt pavement below. lara, he whispered, shutting his eyes, and he had a vision of her head resting on his hands; her eyes were closed, she was asleep, unconscious that he watched her sleeplessly for hours on end. her hair was scattered and its beauty stung his eyes like smoke and ate into his heart.

what an inescapable spell it was! if komarovskys intrusion into laras life had merely filled her with disgust, she would have rebelled and broken free. but it was not so simple as that.
   the girl was flattered that a handsome man whose hair was turning gray, a man old enough to be her father, a man who was applauded at meetings and written up in the newspapers, should spend his time and money on her, should take her out to concerts and plays, and tell her that he worshipped her, and should, as they say, improve her mind.

   she has become his slave for life. how has he subjugated her? how does he force her to submit, why does she surrender, why does she gratify his wishes and delight him with her quivering unconcealed shame? because of his age, her mothers financial dependence on him, his cleverness in frightening her, lara? no, no, no! that is all nonsense.
   it is she who has a hold on him. doesnt she see how much he needs her? she has nothing to be afraid of, her conscience is clear. it is he who should be ashamed, and terrified of her giving him away. but that is just what she will never do. to do this she does not have the necessary ruthlessnesskomarovskys chief asset in dealing with subordinates and weaklings.

   how can he not be ashamed to grovel at her feet and plead with her? we cant go on like this. think what i have done to you! you will end up in the gutter. we must tell your mother. ill marry you. he wept and insisted as though she were arguing and refusing. but all this was just words, and lara did not even listen to these tragic, hollow protestations.
   and he continued taking her, veiled, to dinner in the private rooms of that ghastly restaurant where the waiters and the clients undressed her with their eyes as she came in. and she merely wondered: does one always humiliate those one loves?

was half empty, and every sound in it echoed hollowly. only in front was there a crowd of worshippers standing close together. the building was new. the plain glass of the window added no color to the gray, snowbound, busy street outside and the people who walked or drove through it. near that window stood a church warden paying no attention to the service and loudly reproving a deaf, half-witted beggarwoman in a voice as flat and commonplace as the window and the street.
   in the time it took lara, clutching her pennies in her fist, to make her way to the door past the worshippers without disturbing them, buy two candles for herself and olia, and turn back, prov afanasievich had rattled off nine of the beatitudes at a pace suggesting that they were well enough known without him.

it was the time of the presnia uprising. the guishars flat was in the rebel area. a barricade was being built in tver street a few yards from their house. people carried buckets of water from their yards in order to cement the stones and scrap iron with ice.
   the neighboring yard was used by the workers militia as an assembly point, something between a red cross post and a soup kitchen.
   lara knew two of the boys who went to it. one was nika dudorov, a friend of her school friend nadia. he was proud, straightforward, taciturn. he was like lara and did not interest her.
   the other was pasha antipov, the gymnasium student, who lived with old tiverzina, olia deminas grandmother. lara noticed the effect she had on the boy when she met him at the tiverzins. he was so childishly simple that he did not conceal his joy at seeing her, as if she were some summer landscape of birch trees, gr

   the two boys were playing the most terrible and adult of games, war; moreover, participation in this particular war was punishable by deportation and hanging. yet the way their woollen caps were tied at the back suggested that they were children, that they still had fathers and mothers who looked after them. lara thought of them as a grownup thinks of children. their dangerous amusements had a bloom of innocence that they communicated to everythingto the evening, so shaggy with hoarfrost that it seemed more black than white, to the dark blue shadows in the yard, to the house across the road where the boys were hiding, and, above all, to the continual revolver shots which came from it. the boys are shooting, thought lara. this was how she thought not only of nika and pasha but of the whole fighting city.

   they all went away, even olia demina and fetisova, who whispered to madame guishar in parting that she agreed to the strike for the good of the owner and the establishment. but amalia karlovna was inconsolable.
   what black ingratitude! to think that i was so mistaken in these people! the kindness ive lavished on that brat! well, admittedly shes only a child, but that old witch!
   they cant make an exception just for you, mother, dont you see? lara said soothingly. no one bears you any malice. on the contrary. all thats being done now is done in the name of humanity, in defense of the weak, for the good of women and children. yes, it is. dont shake your head so skeptically. youll see, one day you and i will be better off because of it.

   when they went out the fresh air seemed as unfamiliar as after weeks of illness. noises, rounded, as if turned on a lathe, rolled echoing lightly through the crisp, frosty, nut-clean space. shots and salvoes smacked, thudded, and plopped, flattening the distances into a pancake.
   however much filat tried to convince them to the contrary, lara and amalia karlovna insisted that the shots were blanks.
   dont be silly, filat. think it out for yourself. how could they be anything but blanks when you cant see anyone shooting? who dyou think is shooting, the holy ghost or what? of course theyre blanks.

as early as the spring of 1906only a few months before she would begin her last year in the gymnasiumsix months of laras liaison with komarovsky had driven her beyond the limits of her endurance. he cleverly turned her wretchedness to his advantage, and when it suited him subtly reminded her of her shame. these reminders brought her to just that state of confusion that a lecher requires in a woman. as a result, lara felt herself sinking ever deeper into a nightmare of sensuality which filled her with horror whenever she awoke from it. her nocturnal madness was as unaccountable as black magic. here everything was

   the lesson was about napoleons egyptian campaign. when the teacher came to the landing at frjus, the sky blackened and was split by lightning and thunder, and clouds of dust and sand swept into the room together with the smell of rain. two teachers pets rushed out obligingly to call the handyman to shut the windows, and as they opened the door, the wind sent all the blotting paper flying off the desks.
   the windows were shut. a dirty city rain mingled with dust began to pour. lara tore a page out of an exercise book, and wrote a note to her neighbor, nadia kologrivova:
   nadia, ive got to live away from mother. help me to find a tutoring job, as well paid as possible. you know lots of rich people.
   nadia wrote back:

   he was a remarkable man. his wife, serafima filippovna, was a worthy match. lara admired and respected both of them, and the whole household loved her and treated her as a member of the family.
   for more than three years lara led a life free from worries. then one day her brother rodia went to see her. swaying affectedly on his long legs and drawling self-importantly, he told her that the cadets of his class had collected money for a farewell gift to the head of the academy and entrusted it to him, asking him to choose and buy the gift. this money he had gambled away two

   she got the money from kologrivov.

her work at the kologrivovs did not prevent lara from graduating from the gymnasium, and taking university courses. she did well, and was to obtain her diploma the following year, 1912.
   in the spring of 1911 her pupil lipa graduated from the gymnasium. she was already engaged to a young engineer, friesendank, who came of a good, well-to-do family. lipas parents approved of her choice but were against her marrying so young, and urged her to wait. this led to scenes. lipa, the spoiled and willful darling of the family, shouted at her parents

   in this rich household where lara was accepted as a member of the family, no one reminded her of her debt or indeed remembered it. she would have paid it back long before, if she had not had secret expenses.
   unknown to pasha, she sent money to his father, who had been deported to siberia, helped his querulous and ailing mother, and reduced his own expenses by paying part of his board and lodging directly to his landlady. it was she who had found him his room in a new building in kamerger street near the art theater.

   in the summer of 1911 lara went for the last time with the kologrivovs to duplyanka. she adored the place, and was even fonder of it than its owners. they knew this, and every summer on their arrival the same scene was enacted as though by an unwritten agreement. when the hot, grimy train left them at the station, lara, overwhelmed by the infinite silence and heady fragrance of the countryside, and speechless with emotion, was allowed to walk alone from the railroad station to the estate. meanwhile, the luggage was loade

   the kologrivovs were as fond of her as ever and wanted her to stay on with them, but now that lipa had grown up she felt that she had become useless to them. she refused her salary. they had to press it on her. at the same time she needed the money, and it would have been embarrassing and unfeasible to earn it independently while she was their guest.
   lara felt that her position was false and unendurable. she imagined that they all found her a burden and were only putting a good face on it. she was a burden to herself. she longed to run away from herself and from the kologrivovsanywherebut according to her standards, she must first repay the money she had borrowed, and at the moment she had no means of doing it. she felt that she was a hostageall through rodias stupid faultand was trapped in impotent exasperation.

   i cant. im in a hurry. where is he?
   he was at a christmas party. clutching the scrap of paper with the address on it, lara ran down the familiar gloomy staircase with its stained-glass coats of arms and started off for the sventitskys house in flour town.
   only now, when she came out for the second time, did she take a look around her. it was winter. it was the city. it was night.
   it was bitter cold. the streets were covered with a thick, black, glassy layer of ice, like the bottom of beer bottles. it hurt her to breathe. the air was dense with gray sleet and it tickled and pricked her face like the gray froze

   sit down beside me. sit down, dont bother to finish dressing. im in a hurry, i must go in a minute. dont touch my muff. wait, turn the other way for a minute.

   she liked to sit in the dim light of candles, and pasha always kept a few spare ones. he replaced the stump in the candlestick with a new candle, put it on the window sill, and lit it. the flame choked and spluttered, shooting off small stars, and sharpened to an

 should not, after all, have gone out. he was worried about anna ivanovna. they had been on the point of leaving when, hearing that she was feeling less well, they had gone to her room, but she had ordered them off to the party as sharply as before. they had gone to the window to have a look at the weather. as they came out, the net curtains had clung to tonias new dress, trailing after her like a wedding veil. they all noticed this and burst out laughing.
   yura looked around him and saw what lara had seen shortly before. the moving sleigh was making an unusually loud noise, which was answered by an unusually long echo coming from the ice-bound trees in the gardens and streets. the windows, frosted and lighted from inside, reminded him of precious caskets made of smoky topaz. behind them glowed the christmas life of moscow, candles burned on trees, and guests in fancy dress milled about playing hide-and-seek and hunt-the-ring.
   it suddenly occurred to yura that blok reflected the chris

   without stopping in the ballroom, tonia and yura went through to their hosts rooms in the back.

the living rooms of the sventitskys were cluttered up with furniture that had been moved out of the ballroom and the drawing room. here was the sventitskys magic kitchen, their christmas workshop. the place smelled of paint and glue, and there were piles of colored wrappings and boxes of cotillion favors and spare candles.
   the sventitskys were writing names on cards for presents

   yura and tonia spent half the evening backstage with georges and the old couple.

all this time lara was in the ballroom. she was not in evening dress and did not know anyone there, but she stayed on, either waltzing with koka kornakov like a sleepwalker or wandering aimlessly around the room.
   once or twice she stopped and stood hesitating outside the sitting room, in the hope that komarovsky, who sat facing the doorway, might see her. but he did not take his eyes from his cards, which he held in his left hand and which shielded his face, and he either really did not notice her or pretended

 not to. she was choking with mortification. a girl whom she did not know went in from the ballroom. komarovsky looked at her in the way lara remembered so well. the girl was flattered and flushed and smiled with pleasure. lara crimsoned with shame and nearly screamed. a new victim, she thought. lara saw, as in a mirror, herself and the whole story of her liaison. she did not give up her plan to speak to him but decided to do it later, at a more convenient moment; forcing herself to be calm, she went back to the ballroom.
   komarovsky was playing with three other men. the one on his left was kornakov, the father of the elegant young man with whom lara was dancing again, so she understood from the few words she exchanged with him. and the young mans mother was the tall dark woman in black w

   she had not paid attention to kokas surname when he had first introduced himself, but he repeated it as he swept her in the last gliding movement of the waltz to a chair and bowed himself off. kornakov. kornakov. it reminded her of something. of something unpleasant. then it came back to her. kornakov was the assistant public prosecutor at the moscow c

it was almost two in the morning. yuras ears were ringing. there had been an interval with tea and petits fours and now the dancing had begun again. no one bothered any more to replace the candles on the tree as they burned down.
   yura stood uneasily in the middle of the ballroom, watching tonia dancing with a stranger. she swept up to him, flounced

   the crowd poured out of the sitting room into the ballroom. at the head of it came kornakov, laughingly assuring everyone that he was quite all bright and dabbing with a napkin at a scratch on his left hand. another group, somewhat apart, was leading lara by the arms.
   yura was dumfounded. this girl again! and again in such extraordinary circumstances! and again that gray-haired man. but this time yura knew who he wasthe prominent lawyer, komarovsky, who had had something to do with his fathers estate. no need to greet him. they both pretended not to know each other. and the girl ... so it was the girl who had fired the shot? at the prosecutor? must be for political reasons. poor thing. she was in for a bad time. how haughtily beautiful she wa

   but at once he realized that he was mistaken laras legs gave way under her, they were holding her up and almost carrying her to the nearest armchair, where she collapsed.
   yura was about to rush up to her to bring her around but thought it proper first to show some interest in the victim he walked up to kornakov.
   i am a doctor, he said. let me see your hand. well, youve been lucky. its not even worth bandaging. a drop of iodine wouldnt do any harm, though. theres feliciata semionovna, well ask her.

the hour of the inevitable

lara lay feverish and half conscious in feliciata semionovnas bed; the sventitskys, the servants, and dr. drokov were talking in whispers around her.
   the rest of the house was dark and empty. only in one small sitting room did a lamp on a bracket cast its dim light up and down the long suite of rooms.
   here komarovsky strode with angry, resolute steps, as if he were at home and not a visitor. he would look into the bedroom for news and tear back to the other end of the house, past the tree with

   and what a lot of trouble ahead! this wasnt the sort of thing for which they patted you on the head! the law didnt wink at it. it was not yet morning, and hardly two hours had passed since it happened but already the police had been twice and he, komarovsky, had had to go to the kitchen and see the inspector and smooth things over.
   and the further it went the more complications there would be. they would have to have proof that lara had meant to shoot at him and not at kornakov. and even that wouldnt be the end of it; she would only be cleared of one part of the charge, but she would still be liable to prosecution.
   naturally, he would do everything to prevent it. if the case came to court he would get expert evidence from a psychiatrist that she had not been responsible for her actions at the moment when she fired the shot and would see to it that the proceedings were dropped.
   with these reflections he began to calm

down. the night was over. streaks of light probed from room to room and dived under the chairs and tables like thieves or appraisers.
   after a last look in the bedroom, where he was told that lara was no better, komarovsky left and went to see a friend of his, ruffina onissimovna voit-voitkovsky, a woman lawyer who was the wife of a political migr. her eight-room apartment was now too large for her, she could not afford to keep it all up, so she let two of the rooms. one of them had recently become vacant, and komarovsky took it for lara. there she was taken a few hours later, only half conscious with brain fever.

ruffina onissimovna was a woman of advanced views, entirely unprejudiced

, and well disposed toward everything that she called positive and vital.
   on top of her chest of drawers she kept a copy of the erfurt program with a dedication by the author. one of the photographs on the wall showed her husband, her good voit, at a rally in switzerland, together with plekhanov, both in alpaca jackets and panama hats.
   ruffina onissimovna took a dislike to her sick lodger the moment she saw her. she considered lara a malingerer. the girls feverish ravings seemed to her nothing but play-acting. she was ready to swear that lara was impersonating gretchen gone mad in her dungeon.
   she expressed her contempt for lara by being brisker than usual. she banged doors, sang in a loud voice, tore through her part of the apartment like a hurricane, and kept the windows open all day long.
   the apartment was on the top floor of a building in the arbat. after the winter solstice its windows filled to overflowing wit

h blue sky as wide as a river in flood. through half the winter it was full of the early signs of the coming spring.
   a warm wind from the south blew in through the casements. locomotives at their distant stations roared like sea lions. lara, lying ill in bed, filled her leisure with recollections.
   she often thought of the night of her arrival in moscow from the urals, seven or eight years before, in the unforgettable days of her childhood. she was riding in a cab from the station through gloomy alleys to the hotel at the other end of town. one by one the street lamps threw the humpbacked shadow of the coachman on the walls. the shadow grew and grew till it became gigantic and stretched across the roofs, and was cut off. then it

 all began again from the beginning. the bells of moscows countless churches clanged in the darkness overhead, and the trolleys rang as they scurried through the streets, but lara was also deafened by the gaudy window displays and glaring lights, as if they too emitted sounds of their own, like the bells and wheels.
   in their hotel room she was staggered at the sight of a watermelon of incredible size. it was komarovskys house-warming gift, and to her it was a symbol of his power and wealth. when he thrust a knife into this marvel, and the dark green globe split in half, revealing its icy, sugary heart, she was frightened, but she dared not refuse a slice. the fragrant

 hands. on the occasions when he was summoned to attend a ministerial meeting in petersburg he spoke to the old dignitaries as if they were schoolboys; but now he saw before him a girl who till recently had been part of his household, something like a daughter to him, with whom, as with all other members of his family, he had exchanged words and glances only casually (this constituted the characteristic charm of their closeness, and both he and his family were aware of this). he could not treat lara as an adult, with gravity and indifference. he did not know how to speak to her without offending her. whats the big idea? he said smilingly, as if she were a child. who wants these melodramas?
   he paused, and glanced at the damp stains on the walls and ceiling. then, shaking his head reproachfully, he went on:
   theres an international exhibition opening at dsseldorfpainting, sculpture, gardening. im going. you know, its a bit damp here. and how long do you think youre going to wander about

   and in spite of her protests, her tears, and her struggles, he forced her, before he left, to accept a check for ten thousand rubles.
   when she recovered, lara moved to the lodgings kologrivov had recommended, near the smolensky market. the flat was at the top of an old-fashioned two-story house. there were teamsters living in the other part of it, and there was a warehouse on the ground floor. the cobbled yard was always littered with spilled oats and hay. pigeons strutted about cooing and fluttered up noisily to the level of laras window whenever a drove of rats scurried down the stone gutter.

lara was greatly troubled about pasha. so long as she

was seriously ill he had not been allowed to see her, and what could he be expected to think? lara had tried to kill a man who, as he saw it, was no more than an acquaintance of hers, and this same man, the object of her unsuccessful attempt at murder, had afterwards shielded her from its consequences. and all that after their memorable conversation at christmas, by candlelight. if it had not been for this man, lara would have been arrested and tried. he had warded off the punishment that hung over her. thanks to him she was able to continue her studies, safe and unharmed. pasha was puzzled and tormented.
   when she was better lara sent for him and said: i am a bad woman. you dont know me, someday ill tell you. i cant talk about it now, you can see for yourself, every time i try i start crying. but enough, forget me, im not worthy of you.
   there followed heart-rending scenes, each more unbearable than t

   to deliver pasha from a disgraceful attachment, to tear out his love for her by the roots and put an end to his torment, lara told him that she had decided to give him up because she did not love him, but in making this renunciation she sobbed so much that it was impossible to believe her. pasha suspected her of all the deadly sins, disbelieved every word she said, was ready to curse and hate her, but he loved her to distraction and was jealous of her very thoughts, and of the mug she drank from and of the pillow on which she lay. if they were not to go insane they must act quickly and firmly. they made up their minds

 to get married at once, before graduation. the idea was to have the wedding on the monday after low sunday. at laras wish it was again put off.
   they were married on whit monday; by then it was quite clear that they had passed their examinations. all the arrangements were made by liudmila kapitonovna chepurko, the mother of laras fellow student tusia. liudmila was a handsome woman with a high bosom, a fine low-pitched singing voice, and a head full of innumerable superstitions, some of them picked up and others invented by herself.
   the day lara was to be led to the altar (as liudmila purred in her gypsy voice while helping her to dress) it was terribly hot. the golden domes of churches and the freshly sanded paths in the town gardens were a glaring yellow. the green birch saplings cut on whitsun eve hung over the ch

urch railings, dusty, their leaves rolled up into little scrolls and as though scorched. there was hardly a breath of air, and the sunshine made spots before your eyes. it was as though a thousand weddings were to be held that day, for all the girls were in white dresses like brides and had curled their hair and all the young men were pomaded and wore tight-fitting black suits. everyone was excited and everyone was hot.
   as lara stepped on the carpet leading to the altar, lagodina, the mother of another friend, threw a handful of small silver coins at her feet to ensure the future prosperity of the couple; and with the same intention liudmila told her that, when the wedding crown was held over her head, she must not make the sign of the cross with her bare fingers but cover them with the edge of her veil or a lace frill. she also told lara to hold her candle high in order to have the upper hand in her house. lara, sacr

   when all the guests had gone and they were left alone, pasha felt uneasy in the sudden silence. a street lamp shone from across the road, and however tightly lara drew the curtains, a streak of light, narrow as a board, reached into the room. this light gave pasha no rest, he felt as if they were being watched. he discovered to his horror that he was thinking more of the street lamp than of lara or of himself or of his love for her.
   during this night, which lasted an eternity, antipov (stepanida, or the fair maiden, as he was called by his fellow students) reached the heights of joy and the lowest depths of despair. his suspicious guesses alternated w

nine days later their friends arranged a farewell party for them, in that same room. both pa

sha and lara had graduated with flying colors, and both had been offered jobs in the same town in the urals. they were setting out for it next day.
   again they drank and sang and were boisterous, but this time there were only young people present.
   behind the partition that separated the living quarters from the studio, there stood a big wicker hamper and another, smaller one of laras, a suitcase, a box of crockery, and several sacks. there was a lot of luggage. part of it was being sent next day by freight. almost everything was packed, but there was still a little room left in the box and in the hampers. every now and then lara thought of something else she meant to take and put it into one of the hampers, rearranging things to make it tidy.
   pasha was at home entertaining guests by the time lara got back from the university office where she had gone for her birth certi

ficate and other papers. she came up followed by the janitor with a bundle of sacking and a thick rope for those pieces that were going by freight. after he left, lara made the round of the guests, shaking hands with some and kissing others, and went behind the partition to change. when she came back, they greeted her with applause, sat down, and a noisy party began, like the one a few days earlier. the more enterprising poured vodka for their neighbors; hands armed with forks stretched toward the center of the table where bread, appetizers, and cooked dishes were set out. there were speeches, toasts, and constant joking. some got drunk.

   as an exception komarovsky had been allowed to join the young peoples party. at the end of the evening he started to say how bereaved he would feel when his two young friends left moscowthe town would be like a desert, a sahara; but he became so sentimental that he began to sob, and he had to s

tart all over from the beginning.
   he asked the antipovs permission to write to them and to visit them at yuriatin, if he missed them too much.
   thats quite unnecessary, lara said loudly and nonchalantly. and in general its all quite pointlesswriting, sahara, and all that. as for coming, dont think of it. with gods help youll manage without us, we arent as important as all that. dont you think so, pasha? im sure youll find other young friends.
   then suddenly forgetting with whom she was talking and what she was saying she hurried off to the kitchen. there she took the meat grinder apart and packed the parts into the corners of the crockery case, padding them with

to her hand.
   she was suddenly reminded of her guests by a particularly loud outburst of laughter on the other side of the partition. it occurred to her that when people were drunk they always tried to impersonate drunkards, and the drunker they were the more they overacted.
   at this moment she became aware of another peculiar sound, coming from the yard, through the open window. she pulled the curtains and leaned out.
   a hobbled horse was moving across the yard with short, limping jumps. lara did not know whose it was or how it had strayed into the yard. it was completely light though a long way to sunrise. the sleeping city seemed dead. it was bathed in the gray-blue coolness of the early hours. lara closed her eyes. the characteristic sound of the hobbled horses steps, so unlike anything else, transported her to some wonderful, remote village.
   there was a ring at the door. lara pricked up her ears. someone got up from the table to open. it was nadia! lara ran to meet her. nadia

 had come straight from the train, so fresh and enchanting that it seemed as if she brought with her the scent of the lilies of the valley of duplyanka. the two friends stood speechless with emotion and, hugging each other, could only cry.
   nadia had brought lara the congratulations and good wishes of the whole family and a present from her parents. she took a jewel case out of her travelling bag, snapped it open, and held out a very beautiful necklace.
   there were gasps of delight and astonishment. a guest who had been drunk but had recovered a little said:
   its pink hyacinth. yes, yes, pink, believe it or not. thats what it is. its just as valuable as diamonds.
   but nadia said that the stones were yellow sapphires.
   lara put nadia next to her

at table and made her eat and drink. the necklace lay beside her plate, and she could not stop looking at it. the stones had rolled into a hollow on the mauve-cushioned lining of the case and looked now like dew and now like a cluster of small grapes.
   meanwhile those of the guests who had sobered up were again drinking to keep company with nadia, whom they soon made tipsy.
   soon everyone in the flat was fast asleep. most of them, planning to go to the station with lara and pasha in the morning, stayed the night. a good many had been snoring before nadia came, and lara herself never knew afterwards how she came to be lying fully dressed on the sofa next to ira lagodina.
   she was wakened by the sound of loud voices near by. they were the voices of strangers who had come into the yard to recover their horse. as she opened her eyes she said to herself: what on earth can pasha be doing pottering about in the middle of the room? but when the man she had taken for

 making a mess of her work. that was all she could think of at the moment, half asleep and still tipsy as she was. indignant, she tried to shout and again found she couldnt. then she dug her knee into iras stomach, and when ira yelped with pain she too began to scream. the thief dropped everything and ran. some of the men jumped up and tried to chase him without quite knowing what it was all about, but by the time they got outside the door he had vanished.
   the commotion woke everyone up, and lara, whose tipsiness had suddenly gone, did not allow them to go back to sleep. she made them coffee and packed them off home until it was time to go to the station.
   then she set to work feverishly stuffing the bed linen into the hampers, strapping up the luggage and tying it with ropes, and begging pasha and the janitors wife just not to bother her by trying to help.
   everything got done in time. the antipovs did not miss their train. it started smoothly, as though wafted away by the hats the

the antipovs had done much better in yuriatin than they had hoped to. the guishars were remembered well. this had helped lara over the difficulties of setting up house in a new place.
   lara had her hands full and plenty to think about. she took care of the house and of their three-year-old daughter, katenka. marfutka, their red-haired maid, did her best but could not get all the work done. larisa feodorovna shared all her husbands interests. she herself taught at the girls gymnasium. she worked without respite and was happy. this was exactly the kind of life she had dreamed of.

 gray flannel sleeveless coats. she was drawn to the land and to the common people.
   paradoxically, it was her husband, pavel pavlovich, the son of a moscow railway worker, who turned out to be an incorrigible urbanite. he judged the people of yuriatin much more harshly than she. their crudeness and ignorance irritated him.
   he had an extraordinary capacity, it now appeared, for reading quickly and storing up the knowledge he picked up. he had read a great deal in the past, partly thanks to lara. during the years of his provincial seclusion, he became so well read that even lara no longer seemed to him well-informed. he towered high above his fellow teachers and complained that he felt stifled among them. now in wartime, their standard, commonplace, and somewhat stale patriotism was out of tune with his own, more complicated feelings about his country.
   pavel pavlovich had graduated in classics. he taught latin and ancient history. but from his earlier realgymnasium days he had kept

ussing over him oppressed him, but he would not criticize her for fear that she might take some quite innocent word of his for a reproacha hint, perhaps, that her blood was bluer than his, or that she had once belonged to someone else. his anxiety lest she suspect him of having some absurdly unfair idea about her introduced an element of artificiality into their life. each tried to behave more nobly than the other, and this complicated everything.
   one night they had gueststhe headmistress of laras school, several fellow teachers of her husbands, the member of an arbitration court on which pavel pavlovich too had recently served, and a few others. they were all, from pavel pavlovichs point of view, complete fools. he was amazed at laras amiability toward them, and he could not believe that she sincerely liked any of them.

when larisa feodorovna learned of pashas decision, she was stunned and at first would not believe her ears. its absurd, she thought, a whim. i wont take any notice, and hell forget it.
   but it appeared that he had been getting ready for the past two weeks. he had sent in his papers to the recruiting office, the gymnasium had found a substitute teacher, and he had been notified that he was admitted to the military school at omsk.
   lara wailed like a peasant woman and, grabbing pashas hands, threw herself at his feet. pasha, pashenka, she screamed, dont leave us. dont do it, dont. it isnt too late, ill see to everything. you havent even had a proper medical examination, and with your heart ... youre ashamed to change your mind? and arent you ashamed to sacrifice your family to some crazy notion? you, a volunteer! all your life youve laughed at rodia, and now youre jealous of him. you have to swagger about in an officers unifor

front. his journey took him nowhere near yuriatin, and he was not in moscow long enough to see anyone there.
   his letters from the front were less depressed than those from the omsk school had been. he wanted to distinguish himself so that, as a reward for some military exploit or as a result of some light wound, he could go home on leave and see his family. soon his opportunity was within sight. brusilovs forces had broken through and were attacking. antipovs letters stopped coming. at first lara was not worried. she put down his silence to the military operations: he could not write when his regiment was on the move. but in the autumn the advance slowed down, the troops were digging themselves in, and there was still no word from him. his wife began to be worried, and to make inquiries, at first locally, in yuriatin, then by mail in moscow and at his old field address. there was no reply; nobody seemed to know anything.
   like other local ladies, larisa feodorovna had been giving a ha

 his own transfer? giving the boredom and uselessness of garrison duty as his reasons, he asked to be sent to the front. this earned him a good mark, and when, at the first engagement, he showed his other qualities it turned out that he had the makings of an excellent officer and he was quickly promoted to first lieutenant.
   galiullin had met antipov in 1905, when pasha antipov spent six months with the tiverzins and yusupka went to play with him on sundays. there too he had once or twice met lara. he had heard nothing of either of them since. when antipov came from yuriatin and joined the regiment, galiullin was struck by the change in his old friend. the shy, mischievous, and girlish child had turned into an arrogant, know-it-all misanthrope. he was intelligent, very brave, taciturn, and sarcastic. sometimes, looking at him, galiullin could have sworn that he saw in his gloomy eyes, as inside a window, something beyond, an idea that had taken firm hold of him: a longing for his daughte

   as was bound to happen sooner or later, laras inquiries for her husband reached galiullin. he meant to write to her, but he was busy, he had no time to write properly, yet he wished to prepare her for the blow. he kept postponing a long, detailed letter to her until he heard that she was somewhere at the front as a nurse. and he did not know where to address his letter to her now.

   zhivago and galiullin each recognized her without realizing that the other knew her. she knew neither of them. she said: hello. why is the window open? arent you cold? going up to galiullin, she asked him how he felt and took his wrist to feel his pulse, but immediately let go of it and sat down by his bed, looking at him with a puzzled expression.

   thank you. i am a doctor. i am looking after myself. i dont need anything.
   how have i offended him? lara wondered. she looked in surprise at the stranger with his snub nose and unremarkable face.
   for several days the weather was variable, uncertain, with a warm, constantly murmuring wind in the night, smelling of damp earth.
   during those days there came strange reports from g.h.q., and there were alarming rumors from the interior. telegraphic communications with petersburg were cut off time and again. everywhere, at every corner, people were talking politics.

   it occurred to lara that after all the devotion galiullin had shown to pashas memory, the pains he had taken to look after his things, she had not so much as asked him who he was and where he came from.
   to make up for her omission and not seem ungrateful she asked him all about himself when she made her next morning round.

   you were right. theres no one. she had been all around the house; a branch knocking on the pantry window had broken one of the panes and there were huge puddles on the floor, and the same thing in what used to be laras roomthere was a sea, a real sea, an ocean. and on this side, look, theres a broken shutter knocking on the casement, do you see it? thats all it was.
   they talked a little, locked the door, and went back to their rooms, both regretting that the alarm had been a false one.

   two months had now elapsed since the day when, instead of going home from yuriatin, he spent the night at larisa feodorovnas and told his family that he had been kept on business and had stayed at samdeviatovs inn. he had long been calling her lara and addressing her as thou, though she still called him zhivago. yurii andreievich was betraying tonia, and his involvement was becoming ever more serious. this was shocking, impossible.
   he loved tonia, he worshipped her. her peace of mind meant more to him than anything in the world. he would defend her honor more devotedly than her father or herself. he would have torn apart with his own hands anyone who would hurt her pride. and yet he himself was now the offender.

   what next? he had sometimes wondered, and hoped wretchedly for some impossible, unexpected circumstance to solve his problem for him.
   but now he no longer wondered. he had decided to cut the knot, and he was going home with a solution. he would confess everything to tonia, beg her to forgive him, and never see lara again.
   not that everything was quite as it should be. he felt now that he had not made it clear enough to lara that he was breaking with her for good, forever. he had announced to her that morning that he wished to make a clean breast of it with tonia and that they must stop seeing each other, but now he had the feeling that he had softened it all down and not made it sufficiently definite.

ear him out as calmly as she could. they were talking in one of the empty front rooms. tears were running down her cheeks, but she was no more conscious of them than the stone statues on the house across the road were of the rain running down their faces. she kept saying softly: do as you think best, dont worry about me. ill get over it. she was saying it sincerely, without any false magnanimity, and as she did not know that she was crying she did not wipe away her tears.
   at the thought that lara might have misunderstood him, and that he had left her with a wrong impression and false hopes, he nearly turned and galloped straight back, to say what he had left unsaid and above all to take leave of her much more warmly, more tenderly, in a manner more suitable to a last farewell. controlling himself with difficulty, he continued on his way.

   suddenly yurii andreievich was struck by a very simple thought. what was the hurry? he would not go back on his promise to himself; the confession would be made, but who had said that it must be made that day? he had not said anything to tonia yet, it was not too late to put it off till his next trip to town. he would finish his conversation with lara, with such warmth and depth of feeling that it would make up for all their suffering. how splendid, how wonderful! how strange that it had not occurred to him before!
   at the thought of seeing lara once more his heart leapt for joy. in anticipation he lived through his meeting with her.

   laras left shoulder had been cut open. like a key turning in the lock of a secret safe, the sword unlocked her shoulder blade and the secrets she had kept in the depths of her soul came to light. unfamiliar towns, streets, rooms, countrysides unrolled like a film, whole reels of film, unfolding, discharging their contents.

   the footpath brought the doctor to the foot of the rowan tree, whose name he had just spoken. it was half in snow, half in frozen leaves and berries, and it held out two white branches toward him. he remembered laras strong white arms and seized the branches and pulled them to him. as if in answer, the tree shook snow all over him. he muttered without realizing what he was saying, and completely beside himself: ill find you, my beauty, my love, my rowan tree, my own flesh and blood.
   it was a clear night with a full moon. he made his way farther into the taiga, to the marked tree, unearthed his things, and left the camp.

   the doctor meant to read the notices posted on the house of sculptures, but his eyes kept wandering to the third-floor windows of the house across the street. these were the windows of the rooms in which the furniture left by the previous occupants had been stored. now, although the frost had filmed them at the edges, it was clear that the glass was transparent; the whitewash had evidently been removed. what did this mean? had the former occupants returned? or had lara moved out and new tenants moved in, rearranging everything?
   the uncertainty was unbearable. the doctor crossed the street, went in, and climbed the front staircase he knew so well and which was so dear to him. how often at the camp he had recalled the openwork pattern of the cast-iron steps down to the last scroll. in one place you could look through the lumber room in the basement where broken chairs and old pails and tin tubs had been stacked. they were still there; nothing had changed. th

 he noticed that there was now a padlock on the door, hanging from two rings roughly screwed into the old oak panels with their fine carving, which in places had come away. such destructiveness would have been inconceivable in the old days. there would have been a fitted lock, and if it had been out of order there were locksmiths to repair it. this trifling detail was eloquent of the general deterioration of things, which had gone a great deal further in his absence.
   the doctor was sure that lara and katenka were not at home. perhaps they were not even in yuriatin, and perhaps they were not even alive. he was prepared for the worst. it was only in order not to leave a stone unturned that he decided to look for the key in the hollow between the bricks, where a rat had so greatly frightened katenka. he kicked at the wall, to make sure of not putting his hand on one now. he had not the slightest hope of finding anything. the hollow was closed by a brick. he removed it and felt inside. oh,

dont move. youll see i am using the front rooms now. the flat is rather empty, ive had to sell some of the furniture. ive left a little food, boiled potatoes mostly. put the lid back on the saucepan with a weight on it, to keep the rats out. im mad with joy.
   he read to the bottom of the page, and did not notice that the letter continued on the back. he pressed it to his lips, folded it, and put it into his pocket with the key. mixed with his immense joy, he felt a sharp, stabbing pain. since lara was going to varykino, and not even bothering to explain, it must be that his family were not there. he felt not only anxious because of this, but unbearably aggrieved and sad about them. why hadnt she said a single word of how and where they were?as if they didnt exist at all!
   but it was getting darker, and he had still many things to do while it was light. one of the most urgent was to read the texts of the decrees posted in the street. it was no trifling matter in those days to be ignoran

   the doctors head was spinning. he fainted and fell down unconscious on the sidewalk. when he came to and people helped him to get up and offered to take him where he wished to go, he thanked them and refused, saying he had only to cross the street.

he went up again, and this time he unlocked the door of laras flat. it was still light on the landing, no darker than before he had gone out. he was glad that the sun was not hurrying him.
   the creaking of the door touched off a commotion inside. the uninhabited flat greeted him with the clang and rattle of falling tin pans. rats, scuttling off the shelves, plopped onto the floor and scattered. they must have bred here by the thousands. the doctor felt sick and helpless to deal with this abomination and decided to barricade himself for the night in one

glass.
   he turned left to the part of the flat that he did not know, crossed a dark passage, and came into a light room with two windows facing the street. directly opposite the window was the gray building with the statues; groups of people stood with their back to him, reading the announcements.
   the light in the room was of the same quality as outside, it was the same new, fresh evening light of early spring. this seemed to make the room a part of the street; the only difference was that laras bedroom, where he was standing, was colder than the street.
   his sudden weakness earlier that afternoon as he approached the town and walked through it an hour or two ago had made yurii andreievich think that he was ill, and had filled him with fears. now, the sameness of the light in the house and in the street exhilarated him. bathed in the same chilled air as the passers-by, he felt a kinship with them, an identity with the mood of the town, with life in the world. this dispelled his fear

s. he no longer thought he would be ill. the transparency of the spring evening, the all-penetrating light were a good omen, a promise of generous fulfillment of distant and far-reaching hopes. all would be well, he would achieve all he wanted in life, he would find and reunite and reconcile them all, he would think everything out and find all the right words. he waited for the joy of seeing lara as an immediate proof that all the rest would follow.
   a wild excitement and an uncontrollable restlessness supplanted his earlier fatigue. in reality this animation was an even surer symptom of approaching illness than his recent weakness. yurii andreievich could not sit still. once again he felt the urge to go out.
   he wanted, before he settled down, to have a haircut and get rid of his beard. he had looked for a barber earlier, on his way through town. but some of the barbershops he had

   now it occurred to him that there had once been a tailors workshop in spassky street; if it still existed and he got to it before closing time, he might borrow a pair of scissors. he walked out.

his memory had not failed him. the workshop was still there, with its entrance from the street and a window running the width of the front. the seamstresses worked in full view of the passers-by. you could see right into the back of the room.

   thats lara shes talking about, thought yurii andreievich. but he kept prudently silent and did not ask for details. her absurd remark about the spanish novels again oddly reminded him of somethingprecisely by its absurdity and irrelevancebut he still couldnt think what it was.

d the kerosene. in the bedroom he found a small oil lamp; the rats had been at the oil but a little was left.
   in some places the skirting had come away from the floor. it took him a little over an hour to pack the cracks with broken glass. the door fitted well, and once it was closed the bedroom should be ratproof.
   there was a dutch stove in a corner of the room, with a tiled cornice not quite reaching the ceiling. in the kitchen there was a stack of logs. yurii andreievich decided to rob lara of a couple of armfuls and, getting down on one knee, he gathered them up and balanced them on his left arm. carrying them into the bedroom, he stacked them near the stove and had a look inside to see how it worked and in what condition it was. he had meant to lock the door but the latch was broken; he wedged it firmly with paper; then he laid the fire at his leisure and lit it.
   as he put in more logs, he noticed that the cross section of one of them was marked with the letters k.d. he recog

   the discovery upset him. these logs in laras house must mean that she was in touch with samdeviatov and that he provided for her as he had once supplied the doctor and his household with all their needs. he had always found it irksome to accept his help. now his embarrassment at being in his debt was complicated by other feelings.
   it was hardly likely that samdeviatov helped lara out of sheer goodness of heart. he thought of samdeviatovs free and easy ways and of laras rashness as a woman. there must surely be something between them.

   what a fool he had been to keep remembering this house and missing it, what a fool to have come into this room not as into an ordinary room but as if into the heart of his longing for lara! how silly his way of feeling would seem to anyone outside! how different was the way strong, practical, efficient, handsome males, such as samdeviatov, lived and spoke and acted! and why should lara be expected to prefer his weakness and the dark, obscure, unrealistic language of his love? did she need this confusion? did she herself want to be what she was to him?
   and what was she to him, as he had just put it? oh, that question he could always answer.

   this was exactly what lara was. you could not communicate with life and existence, but she was their representative, their expression, in her the inarticulate principle of existence became sensitive and capable of speech.
   and all that he had just reproached her with in a moment of doubt was untrue, a thousand times untrue! everything about her was perfect, flawless.
   tears of admiration and repentance filled his eyes. opening the stove door, he poked the fire; he pushed the logs that were ablaze and had turned into

   he drew her crumpled letter from his pocket. it was folded so that the back of the page he had read earlier was outside, and now he saw that there was something written on it. smoothing it out, he read it by the dancing firelight:

   inside, people were lying about asleep in their clothes like travellers, and the rooms were untidy like a railway car, with half-eaten legs and wings of roast chicken and other remnants of food scattered about on greasy bits of newspaper. the shoes that the many friends, relatives, callers, and homeless people, all sheltering in the apartment, had removed for the night, were standing in pairs on the floor. the hostess, lara, in a dressing gown tied hastily around her waist, moved swiftly and silently from room to room, hurrying about her chores, and he was following her step by step, muttering clumsy irrelevant explanations and generally making a nuisance of himself. but she no longer had a moment to give him and took no notice of his mutterings except for turning to him now and then with a tranquil, puzzled look or bursting into her inimitable, candid, silvery laughter. this was the only form of intimacy that rem

he had complained that heaven had cast him off, but now the whole breadth of heaven leaned low over his bed, holding out two strong, white, womans arms to him. his head swimming with joy, he fell into a bottomless depth of bliss as one who drops unconscious.

   their subdued conversations, however casual, were as full of meaning as the dialogues of plato.

   most of his way from laras to the hospital lay in the shadow of spreading trees, past curious little frame houses with steep roofs, decorated doors, and carved and painted patterns around the windows. the house next to the hospital, standing in its own garden, had belonged to goregliadova, a merchants wife. it was faced with glazed, diamond-cut tiles, like the ancient boyar houses in moscow.

   coming home at night, hungry and tired, he found lara busy at her domestic chores, cooking and washing. in this prosaic, weekday aspect of her being, dishevelled, with her sleeves rolled and her skirts tucked up, she almost frightened him by her regal attractiveness, more breath-taking than if he had found her on the point of going to a ball, taller in high-heeled shoes and in a long, low-cut gown with a sweeping, rustling skirt.

or when the cooking, washing, and cleaning had all been got out of the way, she gave lessons to katenka; or with her nose in her textbooks worked at her own political re-education, in order to qualify as a teacher at the new, reorganized school.
   the closer this woman and her daughter became to him, the less he dared to think of them as family and the stricter was the control imposed on his thoughts by his duty to his own family and the pain of his broken faith. there was nothing offensive to lara or katenka in this limitation. on the contrary, this attitude on his part contained a world of deference that excluded every trace of vulgarity.
   but the division in him was a sorrow and a torment, and he became accustomed to it only as one gets used to an un-healed and frequently reopened wound.

pital. a cache of arms had been found and a counterrevolutionary organization uncovered. many people were arrested and the wave of searches and arrests continued. it was whispered that some of the suspects had escaped across the river. though what good will it do them? people said. there are rivers and rivers. now the amur, for instance, at blagoveshchenskyou jump in and swim across and you are in china! that really is a river. thats quite a different matter.
   the air is full of threats, said lara. our time of safety is over. they are sure to arrest us, you and me. and then what will become of katenka? i am a mother, i cant let this misfortune happen, i must think of something. i must have a plan. its driving me out of my mind.
   lets try to think. though what is there that we can do? is it in our power to avert this blow? isnt it a matter of fate?
   we certainly cant escape, theres nowhere to go. but we could withdraw into the shadow, into the background. go to varykino, for instance.

once again he had been to the station and had again come back without having accomplished anything. everything was still undecided. he and lara were faced with the unknown. the weather was cold and dark as before the first snow. the sky, particularly where large patches of it could be seen, as at intersections, had a wintry look.
   when yurii andreievich came home, he found that lara had a visitor, sima. they were having a conversation that was more like a lecture sima was delivering to her hostess. yurii andreievich did not want to be in their way. he also wanted to be alone a little. the women were talking in the next room. the door

ood at that. it makes me sad to realize it. i am depressed from exhaustion and sleeplessness. it steadies me to listen to you. and then, its going to snow any minute. its lovely when its snowing to listen to long, intelligent talk. if you glance out of the corner of your eye at the window when its snowing you always feel as if someone were coming to the door across the yard, have you noticed? go on, sima dear. im listening.
   where did we leave off last time?
   yurii andreievich did not catch laras reply. he listened to what sima was saying:
   its possible to use words such as culture, epochs. but people understand them in so many different ways. because their meaning is ambiguous, i wont use them. ill replace them with other words.
   i would say that man is made up of two parts, of god and work. each succeeding stage in the development of the human spirit is marked by the achievement over many generations of an enormously slow and lengthy work. such a work was egypt. greece was anothe

   magpies mean snow, thought the doctor. at the same moment sima said aloud in the other room:
   magpies mean news. youll have guests, or else a letter.
   a little later someone pulled the handle of the doorbell, which yurii andreievich had mended a few days earlier. lara came out from behind the curtain and walked swiftly through to the hall to open the door. yurii andreievich heard her talking with simas sister glafira.
   youve come for your sister? yes, shes here.
   no, i didnt come for her, though we might as well go home together if she is ready. ive brought a letter for your friend. its lucky for him that i once had a job at the post office. i dont know how many hands its been through, its from moscow and its been five months on the way. they couldnt fin

   the long letter, written on many sheets of paper, crumpled and soiled in its tattered envelope, which had been opened at the post office, was from tonia. the doctor found it in his hands without knowing how it had got there; he had not noticed lara handing it to him. when he began reading it he was still conscious of being in yuriatin, in laras house, but gradually, as he read on, he lost all realization of it. sima came out, greeted him, and said goodbye; he said the right things automatically but paid no attention to her and never noticed when she left the house. gradually he forgot more and more completely where he was or what surrounded him.

winter had settled in. it was snowing hard as yurii andreievich walked back from the hospital. lara met him in the hall.
   komarovsky is here, she said in a low, hoarse voice. she stood looking bewildered as if she had been struck.
   where? here?
   no, of course not. he came this morning and said he would come back tonight. hell be here soon. he wants to have a word with you.
   why has he come?
   i didnt understand all he said. he said he was going to the far east and that he had come out of his way to see us. particularly to see you and pasha. he talked a great deal about both of you. h

   i will go out. i dont want to see him.
   lara burst into tears and tried to throw herself at his feet and clasp his knees, but he forced her to get up.
   please dont go, for my sake, she implored him. it isnt that im frightened of being alone with him, but its so painful. spare me from having to see him alone. besides, he is practical, experiencedhe might really have some advice to give us. your aversion for him is natural, but please put your feelings aside. dont go.
   what is the matter with you, darling? dont be so upset. what are you

r ears. blushing a little, she said:
   you see, yurochka, how important all this is for you and for pasha?
   you are too trusting, my dear. you cant take a half-formed plan for an accomplished fact. i dont say victor ippolitovich is deliberately misleading us, but so far he has only told us about castles in the air. for my part, he said, turning to komarovsky, thank you for the interest you take in my affairs, but you surely dont imagine that i am going to let you run them? as for strelnikov, lara will have to think it over.
   all it comes down to, said lara, is whether we go with him or not. you know perfectly well i wouldnt go without you.
   komarovsky sipped the diluted alcohol that yurii andreievich had brought from the hospital, ate boiled potatoes, and became more and more tipsy.

 in the front of the sleigh and had tied them down with rope. yurii andreievich drove either kneeling upright on the floor of the sleigh like the local peasants or sitting with his legs in samdeviatovs felt boots hanging over the side.
   in the afternoon when, as usual in winter, the day seemed on the point of ending long before sunset, yurii andreievich began to whip the horse mercilessly. it shot forward like an arrow. the sleigh pitched and tossed on the uneven road, like a ship in a storm. lara and katia were bundled up in their fur coats so that they could hardly move. swinging around corners and bumping over ruts, they rolled from side to side and down into the hay like sacks, laughing themselves sick. sometimes the doctor drove into the snowy banks on purpose, for a joke, and harmlessly tipped them all out into the snow. after being dragged for a few yards by the reins he stopped the horse, righted the sleigh, and was pummelled by lara and katia, who climbed back, scolding and laug

gos house came first they stopped in front of it. they burst in like robbers, hurrying because it would soon be dark. but inside it was dark already, so that yurii andreievich never saw half the destruction and abomination. part of the furniture he remembered was still there; varykino was deserted and there was no one to complete the damage. he could see no personal belongings; but as he had not been there when his family left he could not tell how much they had taken with them. in the meantime lara was saying:
   we must hurry. it will be dark in a moment. we havent time to stand about thinking. if we are to stay here, the horse must go into the barn, the food into the hallway, and we must fix this room for ourselves. but im against it. we talked it all out before. it will be painful for you and therefore also for me. what was this room, your bedroom? no, the nursery. theres your sons crib. it would be too small for katia. on the other hand, the windows are whole, there are no cracks in t

e tidiness of certain parts of the house, particularly of mikulitsyns study. someone must have been living here until recently, but who? had it been any of the mikulitsyns, where had they gone, and why had they put a padlock on the door instead of using their keys? furthermore, if the mikulitsyns had been here continuously for long stretches, wouldnt the whole house have been tidy and not just some of the rooms? everything spoke of an intruder, but who could it have been? neither the doctor nor lara worried about the mystery. they did not try to solve it. there were plenty of half-looted houses now, and plenty of fugitives. some white officer on the run, they told each other. if he comes well make some arrangement.
   once again, as so long before, yurii andreievich stood spellbound in the door of the study, so spacious and comfortable with its large, convenient table by the window. and once again he thought that such austere surroundings would be conducive to patient, fruitful work.

   they lay down without undressing, using their fur coats for blankets, and fell into a deep, sound, blissful sleep, like children after running about and playing all day.
6
from the moment they got up, yurii andreievich kept glancing at the table standing so temptingly by the window. his fingers itched for paper and pen. but he put off writing until the evening, until after lara and katia would have gone to bed. until then he would have his hands full, even if no more than two of the rooms were to be made habitable. in looking forward to the evening he had no important work in mind. it was merely that the passion to write possessed him.
   he had to scribble something. for a beginning, he would put down old unwritten thoughts, just to get him into trim. later, he hoped, if he and lara managed to stay on, there would be time for undertaking something new, important.

   what can you be thinking of, yurii andreievich? katia protested like a grownup. they arent mine. and they are for a baby. im too big.
   but the next moment she had made herself comfortable in the middle of the rug and all the toys had turned into bricks for a house for ninka, the doll she had brought from town. it was a much more sensible and settled home than any of the temporary lodgings in other peoples houses where she had spent most of her life.
   lara watched her from the kitchen. look at that instinct for domesticity. it just shows, nothing can destroy the longing for home and for order. children are more honest, they arent frightened of the truth, but we are so afraid of seeming to be behind the times that we are ready to betray what is most dear to us and praise what repels us and say yes to what we dont understand.

for dinner, lara, who had started on the provisions they had brought and had cooked enough for three days, served an unprecedented feast of potato soup and roast mutton and potatoes. katenka ate till she could eat no more, giggling and getting more and more naughty, and afterwards, warm and full, curled up in her mothers shawl on the sofa and went to sleep.
   larisa feodorovna, hot and tired from the oven, almost as sleepy as her daughter, and pleased with the success of her cooking, was in no hurry to clear a

at the end of the day they washed in plenty of hot water, and lara bathed katenka. feeling blissfully clean, yurii andreievich sat down at the table before the window, his back to the room where lara, wrapped in a bath towel and fragrant with soap, her hair twisted in a turban with another towel, was putting katenka to bed and tucking her up. enjoying the foretaste of concentrated work, he took in what was going on around him with a happy, diffuse attentiveness.
   it was one in the morning when lara, who had been pretending, finally went to sleep. her nightdr

   the stillness that surrounded yurii andreievich breathed with happiness and life. the lamplight fell softly yellow on the white sheets of paper and gilded the surface of the ink inside the inkwell. outside, the frosty winter night was pale blue. to see it better, yurii andreievich stepped into the next room, cold and dark, and looked out of the window. the light of the full moon on the snow-covered clearing was as viscid as white of egg or thick white paint. th

 at the moon or at its silver reflection on the windows. but scarcely had yurii andreievich realized that they were wolves when they turned and trotted off like dogs, almost as if they could read his thoughts. he lost sight of them before he noticed the direction in which they had vanished.
   thats the last straw! he thought. is their lair quite close? perhaps in the gully? how terrible! and samdeviatovs horse in the barn! they must have scented it.
   he decided for the time being not to tell lara, lest he upset her. going back, he shut all the doors between the cold rooms and the heated part of the house, pushed rugs and clothes against the cracks to keep out the draft, and went back to his desk. the lamplight was bright and welcoming as before. but he was no longer in the mood to write. he couldnt settle down. he could think of nothing but wolves and of looming dangers and complications of every kind. moreover, he was tired.
   lara woke up. are you still burning, my precious bright li

   it was freezing; the air was getting noticeably colder, but it was sunny. the snow was yellow at noon, with orange seeping into its honey color like an aftertaste at sunset.
   the laundering and washing that lara had done the day before had made the house damp. the steam had covered the windows with thick hoarfrost and left black streaks of damp on the wallpaper. the rooms were dark and cheerless. yurii andreievich carried logs and water and went on with his inspection of the house, making more and more discoveries, and he helped lara with her endless chores.
   in the rush of some task or other their hands would meet and join, and then they set down whatever they were carrying, weak and giddy with the

d his thoughts. the diffuse mistiness in which everything was enveloped marked the stage preceding the distinctness of the final embodiment. like the confusion of a first rough draft, the wearisome inactivity of the day was a necessary preparation for the night.
   although he felt exhausted, nothing was left untouched, unchanged. everything was being altered and transformed.
   yurii andreievich felt that his dream of remaining in varykino would not come true, that the hour of his parting with lara was at hand; he would inevitably lose her and with her the will to live and perhaps life itself. he was sick at heart, yet his greatest torment was his impatience for the night, his longing so to express his grief that everyone should be moved to tears.
   the wolves he had been remembering all day long were no longer wolves on the snowy plain under the moon, they had become a theme, they had come to symbolize a hostile force bent upon destroying him and lara and on driving them from varykino.

 
 ___________________________
 
   the thought of this hostility developed in him and by evening it loomed like a prehistoric beast or some fabulous monster, a dragon whose tracks had been discovered in the ravine and who thirsted for his blood and lusted after lara.
   the night came and once again the doctor lit the lamp on the table. lara and katenka went to bed earlier than the night before.
   what he had written that night fell into two parts. clean copiesimproved versions of earlier poemswere set out in his best penmanship. new work was written in an illegible scrawl full of gaps and abbreviations.
   in deciphering these scribbles, he went through the usual disappointments. last night these rough fragments had moved him to tears, and he himself had been surprised by some felicitous passages. now these very passages seemed t

mpted by the measure. things scarcely named in the lines evoked concrete images. he heard the horses hoofs ringing on the surface of the poem, as you hear the ambling of a horse in one of chopins ballades. st. george was galloping over the boundless expanse of the steppe. he could watch him, as he grew smaller in the distance. he wrote in a feverish hurry, scarcely able to keep up with the words as they poured out, always to the point and tumbling into place of themselves.
   he had not noticed lara getting out of bed and coming across to the table. she seemed very thin in her long nightdress and taller than she really was. he started with surprise when she appeared beside him, pale, frightened, stretching out her hand and whispering:
   do you hear? a dog howling. even two of them, i think. oh, how terrible! its a very bad omen. well bear it somehow till the morning, and then well go, well go! i wont stay here any longer.
   an hour later, after much persuasion, she calmed down and fell a

g new or different about it. the wolves, after having disappeared for a few days, had again howled in the night. once again, mistaking them for dogs, and frightened by the omen, larisa feodorovna, just as before, announced that she was leaving the next day. her usual balance was disturbed by attacks of anxiety, natural in a woman unused to pouring out her feelings all day long or to the luxury of unrestrained affection.
   the same scenes were repeated again and again, so that when that morning lara, as she had done so many times before, began to pack for the return journey, it was as if the thirteen days since their arrival had not existed at all.
   it was again damp and dark in the rooms, this time because the weather was overcast. it was less cold, and judging from the look of the dark, low clouds it would snow any moment. yurii andreievich was exhausted by the physical and mental strain of too many sleepless nights. his legs were weak and his thoughts were in a tangle; shivering with

cold and rubbing his hands, he walked about from room to room, waiting to see what lara would decide and what he would have to do in consequence.
   she did not know herself. just then she would have given anything to exchange their chaotic freedom for a daily round, however strenuous, but laid down once and for all, for work and obligations, so that they could live a decent, honest, sensible life.
   she began her day as usually making the beds, sweeping, dusting, and cooking breakfast. then she began to pack and asked the doctor to harness the horse; she had firmly resolved to g

ncertain days. he gave up the thought and went to harness the horse.
   he wasnt good at it. samdeviatov had taught him how to do it, but he kept forgetting. still, he managed it, though clumsily. he strapped the yoke to the shafts, wound the slack and knotted the end of the metal-studded strap around one of them, then, one leg braced against the horses flank, pulled the two ends of the stiff collar tight and fastened them. at last he led the horse to the porch, tied it, and went inside to call lara.
   she and katenka had their coats on and everything was packed, but lara was in great distress. wringing her hands and on the verge of tears, she begged him to sit down a moment and, throwing herself into a chair and getting up again, spoke incoherently, in a high-pitched plaintive singsong, stumbling over her words and repeatedly interjecting: what do you think?
   i cant help it, i dont know how its happened, but you can see for yourself, we cant possibly go now, so late, it will be dark so

ked home. in front of the porch stood a roomy peasant sleigh with a sleek black foal harnessed to it, and walking up and down beside it was an equally sleek, plump stranger, who gave the horse an occasional slap and had a look at its fetlocks.
   there were voices coming from the house. neither wishing to eavesdrop nor close enough to hear more than an occasional word, yurii andreievich nevertheless involuntarily slowed down and suddenly stopped. he recognized the voice of komarovsky talking to lara and katenka. they were apparently in the first room near the door. they were arguing, and, judging from the sound of her voice, lara was upset and crying, now violently contradicting him and now agreeing with him.
   something made yurii andreievich feel that just then komarovsky was speaking about him, saying something to the effect that he should not be trusted (serving two masters, he thought he heard), that it was impossible to tell if he were more attached to lara or to his family, that la

ra must not rely on him, because if she did she would be running with the hare and the hounds and would fall between two stools. yurii andreievich went in.
   as he had thought, they were in the first room on the right, komarovsky in a fur coat reaching to his heels, lara holding katenka by her coat collar, trying to fasten it but not finding the hooks and shouting at her not to wriggle, and katenka protesting: easy, mama, youll choke me. all three were standing in their outdoor clothes, ready to leave. when yurii andreievich came in, lara and komarovsky rushed to meet him, speaking together:
   where have you been all this time? we need you so badly!

   but why are we all standing? sit down, victor ippolitovich. how do you mean, darling, where have i been? you know i went to get the wood, and afterwards i saw to the horse. victor ippolitovich, do sit down, please.

   i dont know what larisa feodorovna has in mind. one thing i must explain is this: i deliberately spread the rumor that i had left, but i stayed on to give you and larisa feodorovna more time to think over what we had discussed, and perhaps come to a less rash decision.
   but we cant put it off any longer, broke in lara. now is the perfect time to leave. and tomorrow morning ... but let victor ippolitovich tell you himself.
   one moment, lara dear. forgive me, victor ippolitovich. why should we all stand about in our coats? lets take them off and sit down. after all, these are serious things we have to talk about, we cant settle them in a minute. i am afraid, victor ippolitovich, our discussion has touched on something personal; it would be ludicrous and embarrassing to go into it. but the fact is that while

   but only on condition that you come with us, broke in lara.
   it is as difficult for you as it is for me to think of our being separated, but perhaps we ought to put our feelings aside and make this sacrifice. because theres no question of my going.
   but you havent heard anything yet, you dont know ... listen to what victor ippolitovich says. ... tomorrow morning ... victor ippolitovich.

   she is thinking: its wonderful that things have gone so well, they couldnt be better. her absurd, obstinate yurochka has relented at last, thank heaven, we are going to a nice, safe place, where people are more sensible than we are, where you can be sure of law and order. suppose even, just to be annoying

ck, if the sun didnt go down first (he wouldnt see them in the dark) they would flash past once again, for the last time, on the other side of the ravine, across the field where the wolves had stood two nights before.
   and now this moment also had come and gone. the dark red sun was still round as a ball above the blue snowdrifts along the horizon, flooding the plain with a juicy pineapple-colored light that the snow greedily sucked in, when the sleigh swept into sight and vanished. farewell, lara, until we meet in the next world, farewell, my love, my inexhaustible, everlasting joy. ill never see you again, ill never, never see you again.
   it was getting dark. swiftly the bronze-red patches of sunset scattered on the snow died down and went out. the soft, ashy distance filled with a lilac dusk that turned to deep mauve, its smoky haze smudging the fine lacework of the roadside birches lightly traced on the pink sky, pale as though it had suddenly grown shallow.

   still standing on the veranda, he turned his face to the shut door, his back to the world. my bright sun has set, he kept repeating inwardly, as though trying to engrave these words in his memory. he did not have the strength to utter all these words aloud.
   he went into the house. a double monologue was going on in his mind, two different kinds of monologue, the one dry and businesslike, the other addressed to lara, like a river in flood.
   now ill go to moscow, ran, his thoughts. the first job is to survive. i must not force myself to sleep. instead, i must work all through the night till i drop with exhaustion. yes, and another thing, light the stove in the bedroom at once, there is no reason why i should freeze tonight.
   but there was also this other inward conversation: ill stay with you a little, my unforgettable delight, for as long as my arms and my hands and my lips remember you. ill put my gri

   he went in, locked the door behind him, and took off his coat. when he went into the bedroom, which lara had tidied up so well and so carefully that morning and which her hurried packing had again turned inside out, when he saw the disarranged bed and the things thrown about in disorder on the chairs and floor, he knelt down like a little boy, leaned his breast against the hard edge of the bedstead, buried his head in the bedclothes, and wept freely and bitterly as children do. but not for long. soon he got up, hastily dried his face, looked around him with tired, absent-minded surprise, got out t

something unaccountable was going on in yurii andreievich. he was slowly losing his mind. never before had he led such a strange existence. he neglected the house, he stopped taking proper care of himself, he turned night into day and had lost count of time since lara had left.
   he drank vodka and he wrote about lara; but the more he crossed out and rewrote what he had written the more the lara of his poems and notebooks grew away from her living prototype, from the lara who was katias mother off on a journey with her daughter.
   the reason for his revision and rewriting was his search for strength and exactness of expression, but they also followed the promptings of an inward reticence that forbade him to disclose his personal experiences and the real ev

ents in his past with too much freedom, lest he offend or wound those who had directly taken part in them. as a result, his feeling, still pulsing and warm, was gradually eliminated from his poems, and romantic morbidity yielded to a broad and serene vision that lifted the particular to the level of the universal and familiar. he was not deliberately striving for such a goal, but this broad vision came of its own accord as a consolation, like a message sent to him by lara from her travels, like a distant greeting from her, like her appearance in a dream or the touch of her hand on his forehead, and he loved this ennobling imprint.
   at the same time that he was working on his lament for lara he was also scribbling the end of the notes he had accumulated over the years concerning nature, man, and various other things. as had always happened to him whenever he was writing, a host of ideas about the life of the individual and of society assailed him.

een, just as one cannot see grass growing. wars and revolutions, kings and robespierres, are historys organic agents, its yeast. but revolutions are made by fanatical men of action with one-track minds, geniuses in their ability to confine themselves to a limited field. they overturn the old order in a few hours or days, the whole upheaval takes a few weeks or at most years, but the fanatical spirit that inspired the upheavals is worshipped for decades thereafter, for centuries.
   mourning for lara, he also mourned that distant summer in meliuzeievo when the revolution had been a god come down to earth from heaven, the god of the summer when everyone. had gone crazy in his own way, and when everyones life had existed in its own right, and not as an illustration for a thesis in support of the rightness of a superior policy.
   as he scribbled his odds and ends, he made a note reaffirming his belief that art always serves beauty, and beauty is delight in form, and form is the key to organic

mdeviatov came to see him. he brought him more vodka and told him of how antipova and her daughter had left with komarovsky. he came by the railway handcar. he scolded the doctor for not looking after the horse properly and took it back, unwilling to leave it for three or four more days as yurii andreievich wished, but promising to come back within the week, and personally take him away from varykino for good.
   sometimes, after losing himself in his work, yurii andreievich suddenly remembered lara as vividly as if she were before him, and broke down from tenderness and the sharpness of his loss. as in his childhood, when after his mothers death he thought he heard her voice in the bird calls, in the summer magnificence of kologrivovs garden, so now his hearing, accustomed to laras voice and expecting it as part of his life, played tricks on him and he heard her calling, yurochka! from the next room.
   he also had other hallucinations that week. toward the end of it, he woke up in the ni

ed the blankets up to his chin, he was conscious of the strong refreshment of sleep and he dropped off happily again at once. toward morning he had several short, kaleidoscopic dreams of his childhood, so detailed and logical that he took them for reality.
   he dreamed, for instance, that his mothers watercolor showing a place on the italian riviera suddenly dropped from the wall, and he was aroused by a sound of breaking glass. he opened his eyes. no, it cant be that, he thought. its antipov, laras husband strelnikov, scaring the wolves in the shutma as bacchus would say. but no, what nonsense! it was the picture. there it was, lying in pieces on the floor, he assured himself, back in his dream.
   he woke up late, with a headache from having slept too long. for a time he couldnt think who or where he was.
   then he remembered: strelnikov is in here. its late. i must get dressed. he must be up by now. if not, ill wake him and make some coffee, and well have it together.
