quarter quell, there will be twice the number of tributes. the editors smash cut right into the 
reapings, where name after name after name is called. 

by  the  time  we  get  to  district  12,  i'm  completely  overwhelmed  by  the  sheer  number  of 
kids going to certain death. there's a woman, not effie, calling the names in 12, but she still 
begins with “ladies first!” she calls out the name of a girl who's from the seam, you can tell 
by the look of her, and then i hear the name “maysilee donner.” 

“oh!” i say. “she was my mother's friend.” the camera finds her in the crowd, clinging to 

two other girls. all blond. all definitely merchants' kids. 

“i think that's your mother hugging her,” says peeta quietly. and he's right. as maysilee 
donner bravely disengages herself and heads for the stage, i catch a glimpse of my mother at 
my age, and no one has exaggerated her beauty. holding her hand and weeping is another girl 
who looks just like maysilee. but a lot like some

something,”  peeta  says.  “my  dad 

mentioned it once.” 

i  think  of  madge's  mother.  mayor  undersee's  wife.  who  spends  half  her  life  in  bed 
immobilized with terrible pain, shutting out the world. i think of how i never realized that she 
and my mother shared this connection. of madge showing up in that snowstorm to bring the 
painkiller for gale. of my mockingjay pin and how it means something completely different 

now that i know that its former owner was madge's aunt, maysilee donner, a tribute who was 
murdered in the arena. 

haymitch's  name  is  called  last  of  all.  it's  more  of  a  shock  to  see  him  than  my  mother. 
young.  strong.  hard  to  admit,  but  he  was  something  of  a  looker.  his  hair  dark  and  curly, 
those gray seam eyes bright and, even then, dangerous. 

“oh. peeta, you don't think he killed maysilee, do you?” i burst out. i don't know why, but 

i can't stand the thought.

woods. 

haymitch  seems  bent  on  continuing  in  the  same  direction,  away  from  the  now  volcanic 
mountain, but a maze of tightly woven hedges forces him to circle back into the center of the 
woods,  where  he  encounters  three  of  the  careers  and  pulls  his  knife.  they  may  be  much 
bigger  and  stronger,  but  haymitch  has  remarkable  speed  and  has  killed  two  when  the  third 
disarms him. that career is about to slit his throat when a dart drops him to the ground. 

maysilee donner steps out of the woods. “we'd live longer with two of us.” 

“guess you just proved that,” says haymitch, rubbing his neck. “allies?” maysilee nods. 
and there they are, instantly drawn into one of those pacts you'd be hard-pressed to break if 
you ever expect to go home and face your district. 

just  like  peeta  and  me,  they  do  better  together.  get  more  rest,  work  out  a  system  to 
salvage more rainwater, fight as a team, and share the food from the dead tributes' pac
