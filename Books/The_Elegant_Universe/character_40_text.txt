 could it be that, beyond its being
an  abstract  mathematical  procedure,  the  sequence  displayed  from  figure  11.3(a)  through  figure
11.4(d) might actually occur in nature? might it be that, contrary to einstein's expectations, the fabric
of space can tear apart and subsequently be repaired in the manner described?

the mirror perspective

for a couple of years after their 1987 observation, yau would, every so often, encourage me to think
about the possible physical incarnation of these flop transitions. i didn't. to me it seemed that flop
transitions were merely a piece of abstract mathematics without any bearing on the physics of string
theory. in fact, based on the discussion in chapter 10 in which we found that circular dimensions have
a minimum radius, one might be tempted to say that string theory does not allow the sphere in figure
11.3 to shrink all the way down to a pinched point. but remember, as also noted in chapter 10, that if
a chunk of space collapses—in this case, a spherical

 piece of a calabi-yau shape—as opposed to the
collapse  of  a  complete  spatial  dimension,  the  argument  identifying  small  and  large  radii  is  not
directly applicable. nevertheless, even though this idea for ruling out flop transitions does not stand
up to scrutiny, the possibility that the fabric of space could tear still seemed rather unlikely.

but  then,  in  1991  the  norwegian  physicist  andy  lütken  together  with  paul  aspinwall,  a
graduate-school  classmate  of  mine  from  oxford  and  now  a  professor  at  duke  university,  asked
themselves  what  proved  to  be  a  very  interesting  question:  if  the  spatial  fabric  of  the  calabi-yau
portion of our universe were to undergo a space-tearing flop transi

lly complicated flop transition of figures 11.3 and 11.4 might have a
far  simpler  mirror  description—one  that  might  give  a  more  transparent  view  on  the  associated
physics.

at the time of their work, mirror symmetry was not understood at the depth required to answer
the question they posed. however, aspinwall and lütken noted that there did not seem to be anything
in the mirror description that would indicate a disastrous physical consequence associated with the
spatial tears of flop transitions. around the same time, the work plesser and i had done in finding
mirror  pairs  of  calabi-yau  shapes  (see  chapter  10)  unexpectedly  led  us  to  think  about  flop
transitions  as  well.  it  is  a  well-known  mathematical  fact  that  gluing  various  points  together  as  in
figure 10.4—the procedure we had used to construct mirror pairs—leads to geometrical situations
that are identical to the pinch and puncture in figures 11.3 and 11.4. physically, though, plesser and i

hat  in  figure  11.4(d).  this  suggested  to  us  that  the  evolution  from
figure 11.3(a) through figure 11.4(d) was something that could actually occur in nature.

by late 1991, then, at least a few string theorists had a strong feeling that the fabric of space can

tear. but no one had the technical facility to definitively establish or refute this striking possibility.

inching forward

off and on during 1992, plesser and i tried to show that the fabric of space can undergo space-tearing
flop transitions. our calculations yielded bits and pieces of supporting circumstantial evidence, but
we  could  not  find  definitive  proof.  sometime  during  the  spring,  plesser  visited  the  institute  for
advanced study in princeton to give a talk, and privately told witten about our recent attempts to
realize  the  mathematics  of  space-tearing  flop  transitions  within  the  physics  of  string  theory. after
summarizing our ideas, plesser waited for witten's response. witten turned from the blackb

  and  parcel  of  string  theory.  the
preliminary  calculations  plesser  and  i  had  done,  together  with  insightful  discussions  with  david
morrison, a mathematician from duke university, made it seem that this was the only conclusion that
mirror symmetry naturally supported. in fact, during a visit to duke, morrison and i, together with
some helpful observations from sheldon katz of oklahoma state university, who was also visiting
duke at the time, outlined a strategy for proving that flop transitions can occur in string theory. but
when we sat down to do the required calculations, we found that they were extraordinarily intensive.
even on the world's fastest computer, they would take more than a century to complete. we had made
progress,  but  we  clearly  needed  a  new  idea,  one  that  could  greatly  enhance  the  efficiency  of  our
calculational  method.  unwittingly,  victor  batyrev,  a  mathematician  from  the  university  of  essen,
revealed such an idea through a pair of papers

n a manner more familiar to mathematicians.

the  flip  side  is  that  batyrev's  papers  invoked  areas  of  mathematics  that  most  physicists  had
never  previously  encountered.  i,  for  example,  could  extract  the  gist  of  his  arguments,  but  had
significant  difficulty  in  understanding  many  crucial  details.  one  thing,  however,  was  clear:  the
methods of his paper, if properly understood and applied, could very well open a new line of attack
on the issue of space-tearing flop transitions.

by  late  summer,  energized  by  these  developments,  i  decided  that  i  wanted  to  return  to  the
problem of flops with full and undistracted intensity. i had learned from morrison that he was going
on leave from duke to spend a year at the institute for advanced study, and i knew that aspinwall
would also be there, as a postdoctoral fellow. after a few phone calls and e-mails, i arranged to take
leave from cornell university and spend the fall of 1992 at the institute as well.

no small task since paul is as devout a meat eater as i am a vegetarian. in the midst of catching up on
each other's lives as we were walking along, he asked me if i had any ideas about new things to work

described by string theory, can undergo space-tearing flop transitions. i also outlined the strategy i
had been pursuing, as well as my newfound hope that batyrev's work might allow us to fill in the
missing pieces. i thought that i was preaching to the converted, and that paul would be excited by this
prospect.  he  wasn't.  in  retrospect,  his  reticence  was  due  largely  to  our  good-natured  and  long-
standing intellectual joust in which we each play devil's advocate to the other's ideas. within days, he

aspinwall,  morrison,  and  i  had  almost  daily  impromptu  meetings  with  witten  at  which  he  would
show us new insights following from his approach. as the weeks went by, it gradually became clear
that unexpectedly, his work, from a vantage point completely different from our own, was converging
on the issue of flop transitions. aspinwall, morrison, and i realized that if we didn't complete our
calculation soon, witten would beat us to the punch.

another  to aspinwall. aspinwall  is  a  curious  mixture  of  upper-class  british  sensibility,  largely  a

numerically  on  a  computer,  we  expected  to  get  something  extremely  close  to  but  not  exactly  3,
something like 3.000001 or 2.999999, with the tiny difference arising from rounding errors.

morrison  sat  at  the  computer  with  his  finger  hovering  over  the  enter  button.  with  the  tension
mounting he said, "here goes," and set the calculation in motion. in a couple of seconds the computer

the mirror relation, likely indicating that they cannot actually occur? almost immediately, though, we
all  realized  that  something  funny  must  be  going  on.  if  there  was  a  real  mismatch  in  the  physics
following from the two shapes, it was extremely unlikely that the computer calculation should yield
an answer so close to a whole number. if our ideas were wrong, there was no reason in the world to

 too easy to figure out a way of getting it. we needed to do another
example. having already written all of the necessary computer code, this was not hard to do. we
calculated another particle mass on the upper calabi-yau shape, being careful this time to make no
errors. we found the answer: 12. once again, we huddled around the computer and set it on its way.
seconds  later  it  returned  11.999999. agreement.  we  had  shown  that  the  supposed  mirror is  the
mirror, and hence space-tearing flop transitions are part of the physics of string theory.

at this i jumped out of my chair and ran an unrestrained victory lap around the office. morrison
beamed from behind the computer. aspinwall's reaction, though, was rather different. "that's great,
but i knew it would work," he calmly said. "and where's my beer?"

witten's approach

that monday, we triumphantly went to witten and told him of our success. he was very pleased with
our result. and, as it turned out, he too had just found a way of establish

microscopic understanding of why the spatial tears do not have any catastrophic consequences.

his approach highlights the difference between a point-particle theory and string theory when
such tears occur. the key distinction is that there are two types of string motion near the tear, but only
one kind of point-particle motion. namely, a string can travel adjacent to the tea

ing theory, making it a journey well worth taking.

it begins with a seemingly unrelated question that string theorists have kicked around since the
late  1980s.  mathematicians  and  physicists  have  long  known  that  when  six  spatial  dimensions  are
curled up into a calabi-yau shape, there are generally two kinds of spheres that are embedded within
the shape's fabric. one kind are the two-dimensional spheres, like the surface of a beach ball, that
played a vital role in the space-tearing flop transitions of chapter 11. the other kind are harder to
picture  but  they  are  equally  prevalent.  they  are three-dimensional  spheres—like  the  surfaces  of
beach balls adorning the sandy ocean shores of a universe with four extended space dimensions. of
course,  as  we  discussed  in  chapter  11,  an  ordinary  beach  ball  in  our  world  is  itself  a  three-
dimensional object, but its surface, just like the surface of a garden hose, is two-dimensional: you

 string theory community that not only can the fabric of
space undergo the mild tears discovered earlier (chapter 11), but that far more drastic rips, roughly
illustrated by figure 13.3, can occur as well.

returning to black holes and elementary particles

what does this have to do with black holes and elementary particles? a lot. to see this, we must ask
ourselves the same question we posed in chapter 11. what are the observable physical consequences
of such tears in the fabric of space? for flop transitions, as we have seen, the surprising answer to
this question was that not much happens at all. for conifold transitions—the technical name for the
drastic space-tearing transitions we had now found—there is, once again, no physical catastrophe (as
there  would  be  in  conventional  general  relativity),  but  there  are  more  pronounced  observable
consequences.

two related notions underlie these observable consequences; we will explain each in turn. first,
