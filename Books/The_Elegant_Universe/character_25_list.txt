Edward Witten (1951-) - 
An American physicist. Witten instigated the second
superstring revolution in 1995. It was Witten who first proposed
that the five versions of string theory were really just five interpretations
of the same theory. He also introduced the important possibility
that string theory encompasses far more than just strings.
