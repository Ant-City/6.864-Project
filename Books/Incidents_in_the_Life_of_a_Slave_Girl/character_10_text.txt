        i tried to tell her how grateful i felt for all her kindness, but she interrupted me. "i don't want no tanks, honey. i'se glad i could help you, and i hope de good lord vill open de path for you. i'se gwine wid

you to de lower gate. put your hands in your pockets, and walk ricketty, like de sailors."

        i performed to her satisfaction. at the gate i found peter, a young colored man, waiting for me. i had known him for years. he had been an apprentice to my father, and had always borne a good character. i was not afraid to trust to him. betty bade me a hurried good by, and we walked off. "take courage, linda," said my friend peter. "i've got a dagger, and no man shall take you from me, unless he passes over my dead body."

        it was a long time since i had taken a walk out of doors, and the fresh air revived me. it was also pleasant to hear a huma

n voice speaking to me above a whisper. i passed several people whom i knew, but they did not recognize me in my disguise. i prayed internally that, for peter's sake, as well as my own, nothing might occur to bring out his dagger. we walked on till we came to the wharf. my aunt nancy's husband was a seafaring man, and it had been deemed necessary to let him into our secret. he took me into his boat, rowed out to a vessel not far distant, and hoisted me on board. we three were the only occupants of the vessel. i now ventured to ask what they proposed to do with me. they said i was to remain on board till near dawn, and then they would hide me in snaky

        peter landed first, and with a large knife cut a path through bamboos and briers of all descriptions. he came back, took me in his arms, and carried me to a seat made among the bamboos. before we reached it, we were covered with hundreds of mosquitos. in an hour's time they had so poisoned my flesh that i was a pitiful sight to behold. as the light increased, i saw snake after snake crawling round us. i had been accustomed to the sight of snakes all my life, but these were larger than any i had ever

gnal. we made haste to enter the boat, and were rowed back to the vessel. i passed a wretched night; for the heat of the swamp, the mosquitos, and the constant terror of snakes, had brought on a burning fever. i had just dropped asleep, when they came and told me it was time to go back to that horrid swamp. i could scarcely summon courage to rise. but even those large, venomous snakes were less dreadful

to my imagination than the white men in that community called civilized. this time peter took a quantity of tobacco to burn, to keep off the mosquitos. it produced the desired effect on them, but gave me nausea and severe headache. at dark we returned to the vessel. i had been so sick during the day, that peter declared i should go home that night, if the devil himself was on patrol. they told me a place of concealment had been provided for me at my grandmother's. i could not imagine how it was possible to hide me in her house, every nook and corner of which was known to the flint

        "you must make the most of this walk," said my friend peter, "for you may not have another very soon."

        i thought his voice sounded sad. it was kind of him to conceal from me what a dismal hole was to be my home for a long, long time.

        a small shed had been added to my grandmother's house years ago. some boards were laid across the joists at the top, and between these boards and the roof was a very small garret, never occupied by any thing but rats and mice. it was a pent roof, covered with noth

restlessness increased. i had lived too long in bodily pain and anguish of spirit. always i was in dread that by some accident, or some contrivance, slavery would succeed in snatching my children from me. this thought drove me nearly frantic, and i determined to steer for the north star at all hazards. at this crisis, providence opened an unexpected way for me to escape. my friend peter came one evening, and asked to speak with me. "your day has come, linda," said he. "i have found a chance for you to go to the free states. you have a fortnight to decide." the news seemed too good to be true; but peter explained his arrangements, and told me all that was necessary was for me to say i would go. i was going to answer him with a joyful yes, when the thought of benny came to my mind. i told him the temptation was exceedingly strong, but i was terribly afraid of dr. flint's alleged

 power over my child, and that i could not go and leave him behind. peter remonstrated earnestly. he said such a good chance might never occur again; that benny was free, and could be sent to me; and that for the sake of my children's welfare i ought not to hesitate a moment. i told him i would consult with uncle phillip. my uncle rejoiced in the plan, and bade me to go by all means. he promised, if his life was spared, that he would either bring or send my son to me as soon as i reached a place of safety. i resolved to go, but thought nothing had better be said to m

        when my friend peter was apprised of this, he was disappointed and vexed. he said, that judging from our past experience, it would be a long time before i has such another chance to throw away. i told him it need not be thrown away; that i had a friend concealed near by, who would be glad enough to take to the place that had been provided for me. i told him about poor fanny, and the kind-hearted, noble fellow, who never turned his back upon any body in distress, white or black, expressed his readiness to help her.

        the next morning i peeped through my loophole, and saw that it was dark and cloudy. at night i received news that the wind was ahead, and the vessel had not sailed. i was exceedingly anxious about fanny, and peter too, who was running a tremendous risk at my instigation. next day the wind and weather remained the same. poor fanny had been half dead with fright when they carried her on board, and i could readily imagine how she must be suffering now. grandmother came often to my den, to say how thankful she was i did not go. on the third morning she rapped for me to come down to the storeroom. the poor old sufferer was breaking down under her weight of trouble. she was easily flurried now. i found her in

and her house would be torn down. poor peter! if he should die such a horrible death as the poor slave james had lately done, and all for his kindness in trying to help me, how dreadful it would be for us all! alas, the thought was familiar to me, and had sent many a sharp pang through my heart. i tried to suppress my own anxiety, and speak soothingly to her. she brought in some allusion to aunt nancy, the dear daughter she had recently buried, and then she lost all control of herself. as she stood there, trembling and sobbing, a voice fr

in less than twenty-four hours. he advised getting me on board the boat, if possible; if not, i had better keep very still in my den, where they could not find me without tearing the house down. he said it would not do for him to move in the matter, because suspicion would be immediately excited; but he promised to communicate with peter. i felt reluctant to apply to him again, having implicated him too much already; but there seemed to be no alternative. vexed as peter had been by my indecision, he was true to his generous nature, and said at once that he would do his best to help me, trusting i should show myself a stronger woman this time.

        he immediately proceeded to the wharf, and found that the wind had shifted, and the vessel was slowly beating down stream. on some pretext of urgent necessity, he offered two boat

men a dollar apiece to catch up with her. he was of lighter complexion than the boatmen he hired, and when the captain saw them coming so rapidly, he thought officers were pursuing his vessel in search of the runaway slave he had on board. they hoisted sails, but the boat gained upon them, and the indefatigable peter sprang on board.

        the captain at once recognized him. peter asked him to go below, to speak about a bad bill he had given him. when he told his errand, the captain replied, "why, the woman's here already; and i've put her where you or the devil would have a tough job to find her."

        "but it is another woman i want to bring," said peter. "she is in great distress, too, and you shall be paid any thing within reason, if you'll stop and take her."

        "what's her name?" inquired the captain.

        "o!" exclaimed peter, "god knows i wouldn't harm a hair of your head. i am too grateful to you. but there really is another woman in great danger. do have the humanity to stop and take her!"

        after a while they came to an understanding. fanny, not dreaming i was any where about in that region, had assumed my name, though she called herself johnson. "linda is a common name," said peter, "and the woman i want to bring is linda brent."
