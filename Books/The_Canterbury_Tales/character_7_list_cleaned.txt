the [CHARACTER] - 
                    roaming
priests with no ties to a monastery, [CHARACTER]s were a great object
of criticism in chaucer's time. always ready to befriend young women
or rich men who might need his services, the [CHARACTER] actively administers
the sacraments in his town, especially those of marriage and confession.
however, chaucer's worldly [CHARACTER] has taken to accepting bribes.
