f the slope, ran the brook, no more than
three feet wide, half choked with kingcups, watercress and blue brooklime. the
cart track crossed by a brick culvert and climbed the opposite slope to a five-
barred gate in the thorn hedge. the gate led into the lane.
     the may sunset was red in clouds, and there was still half an hour to twilight.
the dry slope was dotted with rabbits -- some nibbling at the thin grass near their
holes, others pushing further down to look for dandelions or perhaps a cowslip
that the rest had missed. here and there one sat upright on an ant heap and
looked about, with ears erect and nose in the wind. but a blackbird, singing
undisturbed on the outskirts of the wood, showed that there was nothing
alarming there, and in the other direction, along the brook, all was plain to be
seen, empty and quiet. the warren was at peace.
     at the top of the bank, close to the wild cherry where the blackbird sang, was a
little group of holes almost hidden by brambles. in the gre

wouldn't want him. still, i admit he seems to be able to keep out of harm's way."*
     the small rabbit came closer to his companion, lolloping on long hind legs.
     "let's go a bit further, hazel," he said. "you know, there's something queer
about the warren this evening, although i can't tell exactly what it is. shall we go

down to the brook?"
     "all right," answered hazel, "and you can find me a cowslip. if you can't find
one, no one can."
     he led the way down the slope, his shadow stretching behind him on the grass.
they reached the brook and began nibbling and searching close beside the wheel
ruts of the track.
     it was not long before fiver found what they were looking for. cowslips are a
delicacy among rabbits, and as a rule there are very few left by late may in the
neighborhood of even a small warren. this one had not bloomed and its flat

on it when two larger rabbits came running across from the other side of the
nearby cattle wade.
     "cowslip?" said one. "all right -- just leave it to us. come on, hurry up," he
added, as fiver hesitated. "you heard me, didn't you?"
     "fiver found it, toadflax," said hazel.
     "and we'll eat it," replied toadflax. "cowslips are for owsla* -- don't you know
that? if you don't, we can easily teach you."
     fiver had already turned away. hazel caught him up by the culvert.
     "i'm sick and tired of it," he said. "it's the same all the time. 'these are my
claws, so this is my cowslip.' 'these are my teeth, so this is my burrow.' i'll tell
you, if ever i get into the owsla, i'll treat outskirters with a bit of decency."
     "well, you can at least expect to be in the owsla one day," answered fiver.

     "i don't know," answered hazel, trying to look frank and feeling foolish. "he
came of his own accord."
     "well, we'd better ask him, then," said bigwig, with something like a sneer. he
came close to the stranger and sniffed, as hazel had done. he, too, was evidently
affected by the peculiar smell of prosperity, for he paused as though in
uncertainty. then, with a rough, abrupt air, he said, "who are you and what do
you want?"
     "my name is cowslip," said the other. "i don't want anything. i hear you've
come a long way."
     "perhaps we have," said bigwig. "we know how to defend ourselves, too."
     "i'm sure you do," said cowslip, looking round at the mud-stained, bedraggled
rabbits with an air of being too polite to comment. "but it can be hard to defend
oneself against the weather. there's going to be rain and i don't think your
scrapes are finished." he looked at bigwig, as though waiting for him to ask
another question. bigwig seem

situation than hazel. there was silence except for the sound of the rising wind.
above them, the branches of the oak tree were beginning to creak and sway.
suddenly, fiver came forward.
     "we don't understand you," he said. "it's best to say so and try to get things
clear. can we trust you? are there many other rabbits here? those are the things
we want to know."
     cowslip showed no more concern at fiver's tense manner than he had at
anything that had gone before. he drew a forepaw down the back of one ear and
then replied,
     "i think you're puzzling yourselves unnecessarily. but if you want the answers
to your questions, then i'd say yes, you can trust us: we don't want to drive you
away. and there is a warren here, but not as big a one as we should like. why
should we want to hurt you? there's plenty of grass, surely?"

anner, he spoke so reasonably that hazel felt
rather ashamed.
     "we've been through a lot of danger," he said. "everything new seems like
danger to us. after all, you might be afraid that we were coming to take your does
or turn you out of your holes."
     cowslip listened gravely. then he answered,
     "well, as to holes, that was something i thought i might mention. these
scrapes aren't very deep or comfortable, are they? and although they're facing out
of the wind now, you ought to know that this isn't the usual wind we get here. it's
blowing up this rain from the south. we usually have a west wind and it'll go
straight into these holes. there are plenty of empty burrows in our warren and if
you want to come across you'll be welcome. and now if you'l

the little valley between the two copses. closer, before his nose, every blade of
grass, every bracken frond was bent, dripping and glistening. the smell of last
year's oak leaves filled the air. it had turned chilly. across the field the bloom of
the cherry tree under which they had sat that morning hung sodden and spoiled.
while hazel gazed, the wind slowly veered round into the west, as cowslip had
said it would, and brought the rain driving into the mouth of the hole. he backed
down and rejoined the others. the pattering and whispering of the rain sounded
softly but distinctly outside. the fields and woods were shut in under it, emptied
and subdued. the insect life of the leaves and grass was stilled. the thrush should
have been singing, but hazel could hear no thrush. he and his companions were a
muddy handful of scratchers, crouching in a narrow, drafty pit in lonely country.

contribution fiver could make was this beetle-spirited vaporing. he tried to
remember that fiver was undersized and that they had had an anxious time and
were all weary. at this moment the soil at the far end of the burrow began to
crumble inward, then it fell away and silver's head and front paws appeared.
     "here we are," said silver cheerfully. "we've done what you wanted, hazel, and
buckthorn's through next door. but what i'd like to know is, how about what's-
his-name? cowpat -- no -- cowslip? are we going to his warren or not? surely
we're not going to sit cowering in this place because we're frightened to go and
see him. whatever will he think of us?"
     "i'll tell you," said dandelion, from over his shoulder. "if he's not honest, he'll
know we're afraid to come; and if he is, he'll think we're suspicious, cowardly
skulkers. if we're going to live in these fields, we'll have to get on terms with his

     "i don't know how many of them there are," said silver, "but we're quite a
crowd. anyhow, i hate the idea of just keeping away. how long have rabbits been

     "very well," said hazel. "that's how i feel myself. i just wanted to know
whether you did. would you like bigwig and me to go over there first, by
ourselves, and report back?"
     "no," said silver. "let's all go. if we're going at all, for frith's sake let's do it as
though we weren't afraid. what do you say, dandelion?"
     "i think you're right."

     the corner of the opposite wood turned out to be an acute point. beyond it, the
ditch and trees curved back again in a re-entrant, so that the field formed a bay
with a bank running all the way round. it was evident now why cowslip, when he
left them, had gone among the trees. he had simply run in a direct line from their
holes to his own, passing on his way through the narrow strip of woodland that
lay between. indeed, as hazel turned the point and stopped to look about him, he
could see the place where cowslip must have come out. a clear rabbit track led
from the bracken, under the fence and into the field. in the bank on the further
side of the bay the rabbit holes were plain to see, showing dark and distinct in the

blackberry. "after all, the home warren was fairly plain to be seen."
     "yes, but not like that! a couple of hrududil could go down some of those
holes."
     "so could i," said dandelion. "i'm getting dreadfully wet."

     as they approached, a big rabbit appeared over the edge of the ditch, looked at
them quickly and vanished into the bank. a few moments later two others came
out and waited for them. they, too, were sleek and unusually large.
     "a rabbit called cowslip offered us shelter here," said hazel. "perhaps you
know that he came to see us?"
     both rabbits together made a curious, dancing movement of the head and front
paws. apart from sniffing, as hazel and cowslip had done when they met, formal
gestures -- except between mating rabbits -- were unknown to hazel and his
companions. they felt mystified and slightly ill at ease. the dancers paused,
evidently waiting for some acknowledgment or reciprocal gesture, but there was
none.
     "cowslip is in

 the great burrow," said one of them at length. "would you like to
follow us there?"
     "how many of us?" asked hazel.
     "why, all of you," answered the other, surprised. "you don't want to stay out in
the rain, do you?"
     hazel had supposed that he and one or two of his comrades would be taken to
see the chief rabbit -- who would probably not be cowslip, since cowslip had
come to see them unattended -- in his burrow, after which they would all be given
different places to go to. it was this separation of which he had been afraid. he
now realized with astonishment that there was apparently a part of the warren
underground which was big enough to contain them all together. he felt so
curious to visit it that he did not stop to make any detailed arrangements about
the order in which they should go down. however, he put pipkin immediately
behind him. "it'll warm

open place. his whiskers could feel no earth in front and none was near his sides.
there was a good deal of air ahead of him -- he could feel it moving -- and there
was a considerable space above his head. also, there were several rabbits near
him. it had not occurred to him that there would be a place underground where
he would be exposed on three sides. he backed quickly and felt pipkin at his tail.
"what a fool i was!" he thought. "why didn't i put silver there?" at this moment
he heard cowslip speaking. he jumped, for he could tell that he was some way
away. the size of the place must be immense.
     "is that you, hazel?" said cowslip. "you're welcome, and so are your friends.
we're glad you've come."
     no human beings, except the courageous and experienced blind, are able to
sense much in a strange place where they cannot see, but with rabbits it is
otherwise. they spend half their lives underground in darkness or near-darkness,
and touch, smell and hearing convey as much or mor

now had the clearest knowledge of where he was. he would have recognized the

place if he had left at once and come back six months later. he was at one end of
the largest burrow he had ever been in; sandy, warm and dry, with a hard, bare
floor. there were several tree roots running across the roof and it was these that
supported the unusual span. there was a great number of rabbits in the place --
many more than he was bringing. all had the same rich, opulent smell as cowslip.
     cowslip himself was at the other end of the hall and hazel realized that he was
waiting for him to reply. his own companions were still coming out of the
entrance burrow one by one and there was a good deal of scrabbling and
shuffling. he wondered if he ought to be very formal. whether or not he could
call himself a chief rabbit, he had had no experience of this sort of thing. the
threarah would no doubt have risen to the occasion perfectly. he did not want to
appear at a loss or to let h

is followers down. he decided that it would be best to
be plain and friendly. after all, there would be plenty of time, as they settled
down in the warren, to show these strangers that they were as good as
themselves, without risking trouble by putting on airs at the start.
     "we're glad to be out of the bad weather," he said. "we're like all rabbits --
happiest in a crowd. when you came over to see us in the field, cowslip, you said
your warren wasn't large, but judging by the holes we saw along the bank, it must
be what we'd reckon a fine, big one."
     as he finished he sensed that bigwig had just entered the hall, and knew that
they were all together again. the stranger rabbits seemed slightly disconcerted by
his little speech and he felt that for some reason or other he had not struck the
right note in complimenting them on their numbers. perhaps there were not very
many of them after all? had there been dis

 be in doubt -- so this gathering of rabbits
in the dark, beginning with hesitant approaches, silences, pauses, movements,
crouchings side by side and all manner of tentative appraisals, slowly moved, like
a hemisphere of the world into summer, to a warmer, brighter region of mutual
liking and approval, until all felt sure that they had nothing to fear. pipkin, some
way away from hazel, crouched at his ease between two huge rabbits who could
have broken his back in a second, while buckthorn and cowslip started a playful
scuffle, nipping each other like kittens and then breaking off to comb their ears in
a comical pretense of sudden gravity. only fiver sat alone and apart. he seemed
either ill or very much depressed, and the strangers avoided him instinctively.
     the knowledge that the gathering was safely round the corner came to hazel in
the form of a recollection of silver's head and paws breaking through gravel. at
once, he felt warm and relaxed. he had already crossed the whole length

of the
hall and was pressed close to two rabbits, a buck and a doe, each of whom was
fully as large as cowslip. when both together took a few slow hops down one of
the runs nearby, hazel followed and little by little they all three moved out of the
hall. they came to a smaller burrow, deeper underground. evidently this
belonged to the couple, for they settled down as though at home and made no
objection when hazel did the same. here, while the mood of the great hall slowly
passed from them, all three were silent for a time.
     "is cowslip the chief rabbit?" asked hazel at length.

     "that'll make him ask a few questions," he thought. "'why did you leave? why
didn't the rest come? what were you afraid of?' and whatever am i going to say?"
     when the other rabbit spoke, however, it was clear that either he had no
interest in what hazel had said, or else he had some other reason for not
questioning him.
     "we don't call anyone chief rabbit," he said. "it was cowslip's idea to go and
see you this afternoon, so he was the one who went."
     "but who decides what to do about elil? and digging and sending out scouting
parties and so on?"
     "oh, we never do anything like that. elil keep away from here. there was a
homba last winter, but the man who comes through the fields, he shot it with his
gun."
     hazel stared. "but men won't shoot a homba."
     "well, he killed this one, anyway. he kills owls too. we never need to dig. no
one's dug in my lifetime.

s who
were talking quietly together and seemed to be feeding as well. there was a smell
of greenstuff. evidently some kind of food was available underground, like the

threarah's lettuce. hazel stopped to speak to nildro-hain. she asked whether he
had gone as far as the well pit and the el-ahrairah of laburnum.
     "yes, we did," said hazel. "it's something quite strange to me, i'm afraid. but
i'd rather admire you and your friends than stones on a wall."
     as he said this, he noticed that cowslip had joined them and that strawberry
was talking to him quietly. he caught the words "never been near a shape" and a
moment later cowslip replied, "well, it makes no difference from our point of
view."
     hazel suddenly felt tired and depressed. he heard blackberry behind cowslip's
sleek, heavy shoulder and went across to him.
     "come out into the grass," he said quietly. "bring anyone else who'll come."
     at that moment cowslip turned to him and said, "you'll be glad of something

 now. i'll show you what we've got down here."
     "one or two of us are just going to silflay,"* said hazel.
     "oh, it's still raining much too hard for that," said cowslip, as though there
could be no two ways about it. "we'll feed you here."
     "i should be sorry to quarrel over it," said hazel firmly, "but some of us need to
silflay. we're used to it, and rain doesn't bother us."
     cowslip seemed taken aback for a moment then he laughed.
     the phenomenon of laughter is unknown to animals; though it is possible that
dogs and elephants may have some inkling of it. the effect on hazel and
blackberry was overwhelming. hazel's first idea was that cowslip was showing
the symptom of some kind of disease. blackberry clearly thought that he might be
going to attack them and backed away. cowslip said nothing, but his eerie
laughter continued. hazel and blackberry turned and scuttled up

row into the run and at
once came upon strawberry busily thumping a hind leg on the hard earth floor.

     "my mother used to say, 'if you were a horse the ceiling would fall down,'" said
hazel. "why do you stamp underground?"
     "to wake everyone," answered strawberry. "the rain went on nearly all night,
you know. we generally sleep right through the early morning if it's rough
weather. but it's turned fine now."
     "why actually wake everybody, though?"
     "well, the man's gone by and cowslip and i thought the flayrah ought not to lie
about for long. if we don't go and get it the rats and rooks come and i don't like
fighting rats. i expect it's all in the day's work to an adventurous lot like you."
     "i don't understand,"
     "well, come along with me. i'm just going back along this run for nildro-hain.
we haven't got a litter at present, you see, so she'll come out with the rest of us."
     other rabbits were making their way along the run and strawberry spoke to

er sound, changed since the day before. between the copse and the brook,
the slope was covered with pale lilac lady's-smocks, each standing separately in
the grass, a frail stalk of bloom above a spread of cressy leaves. the breeze
dropped and the little valley lay completely still, held in long beams of light and
enclosed on either side by the lines of the woods. upon this clear stillness, like
feathers on the surface of a pool, fell the calling of a cuckoo.
     "it's quite safe, hazel," said cowslip behind him in the hole. "i know you're
used to taking a good look round when you silflay, but here we generally go
straight out."
     hazel did not mean to alter his ways or take instructions from cowslip.
however, no one had pushed him and there was no point in bickering over trifles.
he hopped across the ditch to the further bank and looked round him again.
several rabbits were already running down the field toward a distant hedge
dappled white with great patches of maybloom. he saw bigwig a

thicket of rushes, stood an enclosure of posts and rails half as high as a man.
inside it, the kingcups bloomed and the brook whelmed up from its source.
     on the pasture nearby hazel could see scattered, russet-and-orange-colored
fragments, some with feathery light green foliage showing up against the darker
grass. they gave off a pungent, horsy smell, as if freshly cut. it attracted him. he
began to salivate and stopped to pass hraka. cowslip, coming up nearby, turned
toward him with his unnatural smile. but now hazel, in his eagerness, paid no
attention. powerfully drawn, he ran out of the hedgerow toward the scattered
ground. he came to one of the fragments, sniffed it and tasted it. it was carrot.
     hazel had eaten various roots in his life, but only once before had he tasted
carrot, when a cart horse had spilled a nose bag near the home warren. these
were old carrots, some half eaten already by mice or fly. but to the rabbits

they're all as big as hares and smell like princes!" "hello, pipkin! fill yourself up
to the ears! no more shivering on the banks of streams for you, old chap!"
     "he won't know how to shiver in a week or two," said hawkbit, with his mouth
full. "i feel so much better for this! i'd follow you anywhere, hazel. i wasn't
myself in the heather that night. it's bad when you know you can't get
underground. i hope you understand."
     "it's all forgotten," answered hazel. "i'd better ask cowslip what we're
supposed to do about taking some of this stuff back to the warren."
     he found cowslip near the spring. he had evidently finished feeding and was
washing his face with his front paws.

     "are there roots here every day?" asked hazel. "where--" he checked himself
just in time. "i'm learning," he thought.
     "not always roots," replied cowslip. "these are last year's, as you'll have
noticed. i suppose the remains are being cleared out. it may be anything -- roots,
greenstuff,

old apples: it all depends. sometimes there's nothing at all, especially
in good summer weather. but in hard weather, in winter, there's nearly always
something. big roots, usually, or kale, or sometimes corn. we eat that too, you
know."
     "food's no problem, then. the whole place ought to be full of rabbits. i
suppose--"
     "if you really have finished," interrupted cowslip, "--and there's no hurry; do
take your time -- you could try carrying. it's easy with these roots -- easier than
anything except lettuce. you simply bite onto one, take it back to the warren and
put it in the great burrow. i generally take two at a time, but then i've had a lot of
practice. rabbits don't usually carry food, i know, but you'll learn. it's useful to
have a store. the does need some for their young when they're getting bigger; and
it's particularly convenient for all of us in bad

weather. come back with me and
i'll help if you find the carrying difficult at first."
     it took hazel some trouble to learn to grip half a carrot in his mouth and carry
it, like a dog, across the field and back to the warren. he had to put it down
several times. but cowslip was encouraging and he was determined to keep up
his position as the resourceful leader of the newcomers. at his suggestion they
both waited at the mouth of one of the larger holes to see how his companions
were shaping. they all seemed to be making an effort and doing their best,
although the smaller rabbits -- especially pipkin -- clearly found the task an
awkward one.
     "cheer up, pipkin," said hazel. "think how much you'll enjoy eating it tonight.
anyway, i'm sure fiver must find it as h

ard as you: he's just as small."
     "i don't know where he is," said pipkin. "have you seen him?"
     now that hazel thought about it, he had not. he became a little anxious and,
as he returned across the field with cowslip, did his best to explain something of
fiver's peculiar temperament. "i do hope he's all right," he said. "i think perhaps
i'll go and look for him when we've carried this next lot. have you any idea where
he might be?"
     he waited for cowslip to reply, but he was disappointed. after a few moments
cowslip said, "look, do you see those jackdaws hanging round the carrots?
they've been a nuisance for several days now. i must get someone to try to keep
them off until we've finished carrying. but they're really too big for a rabbit to
tackle. now, sparrows--"
     "what's that got to do with fiver?" asked hazel sharply.
     "in fact," said cowslip, breaking into a run, "i'll go myself."
     but he did not engage the jackdaws and hazel s

slowly grazed their way down into the shade. only a few of the rabbits remained
above ground. almost all were asleep in the burrows. but still fiver sat alone
under the yew tree.
     in the early evening hazel sought out bigwig and together they ventured into
the copse behind the warren. at first they moved cautiously, but before long they
grew confident at finding no trace of any creature larger than a mouse.
     "there's nothing to smell," said bigwig, "and no tracks. i think cowslip's told
us no more than the truth. there really aren't any elil here. different from that
wood where we crossed the river. i don't mind telling you, hazel, i was scared
stiff that night, but i wasn't going to show it."
     "so was i," answered hazel. "but i agree with you about this place. it seems
completely clear. if we--"
     "this is odd, though," interrupted bigwig. he was in a clump of brambles, in
the middle of which was a rabbit hole that led up from one of the warren passages
below. t

     "the funny thing is there's no smell," said bigwig.
     "no -- only rabbit, and that's everywhere, of course. and man -- that's
everywhere, too. but that smell might very well have nothing to do with it. all it
tells us is that a man walked through the wood and threw a white stick down. it
wasn't a man that tore up this ground."
     "well, these mad rabbits probably dance in the moonlight or something."
     "i wouldn't be surprised," said hazel. "it would be just like them. let's ask
cowslip."
     "that's the only silly thing you've said so far. tell me, since we came here has
cowslip answered any question you've asked him?"
     "well, no -- not many."
     "try asking him where he dances in the moonlight. say 'cowslip, where--'"
     "oh, you've noticed that, too, have you? he won't answer 'where' anything.

settled into a contented silence, but no one seemed disposed to go to sleep.
rabbits are lively at nightfall, and when evening rain drives them underground
they still feel gregarious. hazel noticed that almost all his companions seemed to
have become friendly with the warren rabbits. also, he found that whenever he
moved into one group or another, the warren rabbits evidently knew who he was
and treated him as the leader of the newcomers. he could not find strawberry,
but after a time cowslip came up to him from the other end of the hall.
     "i'm glad you're here, hazel," he said. "some of our lot are suggesting a story

you a story of el-ahrairah. that can't go wrong, anyway," he whispered.
     "which one, though?" said dandelion.
     hazel remembered the stones by the well pit. "the king's lettuce," he
answered. "they think a lot of that, i believe."
     dandelion took up his cue with the same plucky readiness that he had shown

in the wood. "i'll tell the story of the king's lettuce," he said aloud.
     "we shall enjoy that," replied cowslip immediately.
     "he'd better," muttered bigwig.

well-fed strangers, with their detached manners, their shapes on the wall, their
elegance, their adroit evasion of almost all questions -- above all, their fits of un-
rabbitlike melancholy. now, their own storyteller had shown that they were no
mere bunch of tramps. certainly, no reasonable rabbit could withhold
admiration. they waited to be told as much, but after a few moments realized
with surprise that their hosts were evidently less enthusiastic.
     "very nice," said cowslip. he seemed to be searching for something more to
say, but then repeated, "yes, very nice. an unusual tale."
     "but he must know it, surely?" muttered blackberry to hazel.
     "i always think these traditional stories retain a lot of charm," said another of
the rabbits, "especially when they're told in the real, old-fashioned spirit."

what they can do themselves." aloud, he said, "our stories haven't changed in
generations, you know. after all, we haven't changed ourselves. our lives have
been the same as our fathers' and their fathers' before them. things are different
here. we realize that, and we think your new ideas and ways are very exciting.
we're all wondering what kind of things you tell stories about."
     "well, we don't tell the old stories very much," said cowslip. "our stories and
poems are mostly about our own lives here. of course, that shape of laburnum
that you saw -- that's old-fashioned now. el-ahrairah doesn't really mean much to
us. not that your friend's story wasn't very charming," he added hastily.
     "el-ahrairah is a trickster," said buckthorn, "and rabbits will always need
tricks."
     "no," said a new voice from the further end of the hall, beyond cowslip.
"rabbits need dignity and, above all, the will to accept their fate."

     "hazel," said fiver suddenly, "i want to get a clear idea of this silverweed, but i
daren't go closer by myself. will you come with me?"
     "why, fiver, whatever do you mean? what is there to be afraid of?"
     "oh, frith help me!" said fiver, trembling. "i can smell him from here. he

the interlaced sprays of the yew tree, stiff twigs twisted in and out, over and
under, hard as ice and set with dull red berries. "come on, hazel," said cowslip.
"we're going to carry the yew berries home in our mouths and eat them in the
great burrow. your friends must learn to do that if they want to go our way." "no!
no!" cried fiver. "hazel, no!" but then came bigwig, twisting in and out of the
branches, his mouth full of berries. "look," said bigwig, "i can do it. i'm running
another way. ask me where, hazel! ask me where! ask me where!" then they
were running another way, running, not to the warren but over the fields in the
cold, and bigwig drop

he long grass, forgetting the quarrel of the previous
night in the joy of their arrival. he could see hawkbit running toward him now
and two or three of the others -- silver, dandelion and pipkin. dandelion, well in
front, dashed up to the gap and checked, twitching and staring.
     "what is it, hazel? what's happened? fiver said--"
     "bigwig's in a wire. let him alone till blackberry tells us. stop the others
crowding round."
     dandelion turned and raced back as pipkin came up.
     "is cowslip coming?" said hazel. "perhaps he knows--"
     "he wouldn't come," replied pipkin. "he told fiver to stop talking about it."
     "told him what?" asked hazel incredulously. but at that moment blackberry
spoke and hazel was beside him in a flash.
     "this is it," said blackberry. "the wire's on a peg and the peg's in the ground --
there, look. we've got to dig it out. come on -- dig beside it."
     hazel dug once more, his forepaws throwing up the soft, wet soil and slipping
against the hard

     he turned away from the body and looked for fiver among the rabbits behind
him. but fiver was nowhere to be seen and hazel was afraid to ask for him, in
case to do so should seem like weakness and a need for comfort.
     "pipkin," he snapped, "why don't you clean up your face and stop the bleeding?
the smell of blood attracts elil. you know that, don't you?"
     "yes, hazel. i'm sorry. will bigwig--"
     "and another thing," said hazel desperately. "what was it you were telling me
about cowslip? did you say he told fiver to be quiet?"
     "yes, hazel. fiver came into the warren and told us about the snare, and that
poor bigwig--"
     "yes, all right. and then cowslip--?"
     "cowslip and strawberry and the others pretended not to hear. it was
ridiculous, because fiver was calling out to everybody. and then as we were
running out silver said to cowslip, 'surely you're coming?' and cowslip simply
turned his back. so then fiver went up and spoke to him very quietly, but i heard

     "i'll kill him," gasped a low, choking voice behind them. they all leaped round.
bigwig had raised his head and was supporting himself on his forepaws alone. his
body was twisted and his hind parts and back legs still lay along the ground. his
eyes were open, but his face was such a fearful mask of blood, foam, vomit and
earth that he looked more l

struggled, dragging his hind legs. then he fell again and crawled forward, trailing
the wire through the grass with the broken peg snickering behind it.
     "let him alone!" cried hazel, for now they were all pressing forward to help
him. "do you want to kill him? let him rest! let him breathe!"
     "no, not rest," panted bigwig. "i'm all right." as he spoke he fell again and
immediately struggled up on his forepaws as before. "it's my back legs. won't
move. that cowslip! i'll kill him!"
     "why do we let them stay in that warren?" cried silver. "what sort of rabbits
are they? they left bigwig to die. you all heard cowslip in the burrow. they're
cowards. let's drive them out -- kill them! take the warren and live there
ourselves!"
     "yes! yes!" they all answered. "come on! back to the warren! down with
cowslip! down with silverweed! kill them!"

burrow? we shall help ourselves to a roof of bones, hung with shining wires! help
ourselves to misery and death!"
     fiver sank down into the grass. bigwig, still trailing his horrible, smooth peg,
staggered up to him and touched his nose with his own.
     "i'm still alive, fiver," he said. "so are all of us. you've bitten through a bigger

peg than this one i'm dragging. tell us what to do."
     "do?" replied fiver. "why, go -- now. i told cowslip we were going before i left
the burrow."
     "where?" said bigwig. but it was hazel who answered.
     "to the hills," he said.
     south of them, the ground rose gently away from the brook. along the crest
was the line of a cart track and beyond, a copse. hazel turned toward it and the
rest began to follow him up the slope in ones and twos.
     "what about the wire, bigwig?" said silver. "the peg will catch and tighten it
again."
     "no, it's loose now," said bigwig "i could shake it off

     "it's bound to be dark at night," said hazel, "and rabbits have got to sleep."
     "in the open?"
     "well, we can go on using these holes if we want to, but i expect a good many
will lie out. after all, you can't expect a bunch of bucks to dig. they might make a
scrape or two -- like that day after we came over the heather -- but they won't do
more than that."
     "that's what i've been thinking about," said blackberry. "those rabbits we left
-- cowslip and the rest -- a lot of the things they did weren't natural to rabbits --
pushing stones into the earth and carrying food underground and frith knows
what."
     "the threarah's lettuce was carried underground, if it comes to that."

thought they could do better? and if they altered their ways, so can we if we like.

things since we left the old warren, haven't we? more than we'd have learned in a
lifetime back there. and digging! it'll be flying next, i suppose. have you noticed
that this soil's quite different from the soil in the old warren? it smells differently
and it slides and falls quite differently, too."
     "that reminds me," said hazel. "i meant to ask you. there was one thing at
that terrible warren of cowslip's that i admired very much -- the great burrow. i'd
like to copy it. it's a wonderful idea to have a place underground where everybody
can be together -- talk and tell stories and so on. what do you think? could it be
done?"
     bigwig considered. "i know this," he said. "if you make a burrow too big the
roof starts falling in. so if you want a place like that you'll need something to hold
the roof up. what did cowslip have?"
     "tree roots."
     "well, there are those where we're digging.

rabbit, but i felt at once that something was wrong. i woke bluebell and i was just
going to wake pimpernel when i realized that there was a whole bunch of rabbits
all round us. they were great, big fellows and they had a very odd smell. it was
like -- well, like--"
     "we know what it was like," said fiver.
     "i thought you probably did. then one of them said, 'my name's cowslip. who

are you and what are you doing here?' i didn't like the way he spoke, but i
couldn't see that they had any reason to wish us harm, so i told him that we'd had
a bad time and come a long way and that we were looking for some rabbits from
our warren -- hazel, fiver and bigwig. as soon as i said those names this rabbit
turned to the others and cried, 'i knew it! tear them to pieces!' and they all set on
us. one of them got me by the ear and ripped it up before bluebell could pull him
off. w

pimpernel was killed by rabbits. what do you think of that?"
     "i think it was a damned shame," said strawberry, before anyone else could
speak.
     "we were running down the fields, beside a little stream," holly went on.
"some of these rabbits were still chasing us and suddenly i thought, 'well, i'll
have one of them anyway.' i didn't care for the idea of doing nothing more than
just run away to save our skins -- not after pimpernel. i saw that this cowslip was
ahead of the others and out on his own, so i let him catch me up and then i
suddenly turned and went for him. i had him down and i was just going to rip
him up when he squealed out, 'i can tell you where your friends have gone.'
'hurry up, then,' i said, with my back legs braced in his stomach. 'they've gone to
the hills,' he panted. 'the high hills you can see away over there. they went
yesterday morning.' i pretended not to believe him and acted as though i was
going to kill him. but he d

merely, "we shan't need to go down the hill so much, after all." then he added,
"but, holly, you smell of blood, you know. it may be dangerous, even here. let's
go back to the wood. it's such a beautiful night that we can sit near the holes to
chew pellets and bluebell can tell us his story."
     they found strawberry and buckthorn on the bank; and when everyone was
comfortably chewing, with ears laid flat, bluebell began.

     "dandelion was telling me last night about cowslip's warren and how he told
the story of the king's lettuce. that's what put me in mind of this tale, even
before hazel explained his idea. i used to hear it from my grandfather and he
always said that it happened after el-ahrairah had got his people out of the
marshes of kelfazin. they went to the meadows of fenlo and there they dug their
holes. but prince rainbow had his eye on el-ahrairah; and he was determined to
see that he didn't get up to any more of his tricks.
