     mephist. now, faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?

     faustus. i charge thee wait upon me whilst i live,
     to do whatever faustus shall command,
     be it to make the moon drop from her sphere,
     or the ocean to overwhelm the world.

     mephist. i am a servant to great lucifer,
     and may not follow thee without his leave:
     no more than he commands must we perform.

     faustus. did not he charge thee to appear to me?

     mephist. no, i came hither[55] of mine own accord.

     faustus. did not my conjuring speeches raise thee? speak.

     mephist. that was the cause, but yet per accidens;[56]
     for, when we hear one rack the name of god,
     abjure the scriptures and his saviour christ,
     we fly, in hope to get his glorious soul;

     there is no chief but only belzebub;
     to whom faustus doth dedicate himself.

     for he confounds hell in elysium:

     mephist. yes, faustus, and most dearly lov'd of god.

     for which god threw him from the face of heaven.

     think'st thou that i, who saw the face of god,
     and tasted the eternal joys of heaven,
     am not tormented with ten thousand hells,

     seeing faustus hath incurr'd eternal death
     by desperate thoughts against jove's[59] deity,
     say, he surrenders up to him his soul,
     so he will spare him four and twenty[60] years,
     letting him live in all voluptuousness;
     having thee ever to attend on me,
     to give me whatsoever i shall ask,
