inner door.

â€”what about that leader this evening? professor machugh asked, coming to
the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.

â€”thatâ€™ll be all right, myles crawford said more calmly. never you fret.
hello, jack. thatâ€™s all right.

â€”good day, myles, j. j. oâ€™molloy said, letting the pages he held slip
limply back on the file. is that canada swindle case on today?

he tossed the tissues on to the table.

flung open.

by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
steps. the tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softl

â€”it wasnâ€™t me, sir. it was the big fellow shoved me, sir.

â€”throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. thereâ€™s a hurricane

lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he
stooped twice.

he pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.

â€”him, sir.

he hustled the boy out and banged the door to.

j. j. oâ€™molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:

the bell whirred again as he rang off. he came in quickly and bumped
against lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.

â€”pardon, monsieur, lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making
a grimace.

â€”my fault, mr bloom said, suffering his grip. are you hurt? iâ€™m in a
hurry.

â€”knee, lenehan said.

he made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:

â€”the accumulation of the anno domini.

â€”sorry, mr bloom said.

he went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. j. j. oâ€™molloy slapped
the heavy pages over. the noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan,
echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:

     â€”we are the boys of wexford
     who fought with heart and hand.

he looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. the editor who,
leaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,
suddenly stretched forth an arm amply.

â€”begone! he said. the world is before you.

â€”back in no time, mr bloom said, hurrying out.

j. j. oâ€™molloy took the tissues from lenehanâ€™s hand and read them,
blowing them apart gently, without comment.

â€”heâ€™ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. look at the young scamps
after him.

â€”show. where? lenehan cried, running to the window. a street cortÃ¨ge

receiving hands.

he walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his
jacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. they jingled then in the
air and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.

â€”heâ€™s pretty well on, professor machugh said in a low voice.

â€”seems to be, j. j. oâ€™molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in
murmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. who has the most
matches? the calumet of peace

he offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. lenehan
promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. j. j.
oâ€™molloy opened his case again and offered it.

â€”thanky vous, lenehan said, helping himself.

the editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. he
declaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor machugh:

      â€˜twas rank and fame that tempted thee,
      â€˜twas empire charmed thy heart.

the professor grinned, locking his long lips.

myles crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.

who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set
his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. he
gazed about him in his toga and he said: it is meet to be here. let us
construct a watercloset.

â€”which they accordingly did do, lenehan said. our old ancient ancestors,
as we read in the first chapter of guinnessâ€™s, were partial to the
running stream.

â€”they were natureâ€™s gentlemen, j. j. oâ€™molloy murmured. but we have also
roman law.

â€”and pontius pilate is its prophet, professor machugh responded.

lenehan announced gladly:

â€”the rose of castile. see the wheeze? rows of cast steel. gee!

he poked mr oâ€™madden burke mildly in the spleen. mr oâ€™madden burke fell
back with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.

â€”help! he sighed. i feel a strong weakness.

lenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling
tissues.

cited the moses of michelangelo in the vatican.

up the staircase.

spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.

all of rain and all refreshed and will much increase
the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come
for a prognostication of malachiâ€™s almanac (and i hear that mr russell
has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the hindustanish
for his farmerâ€™s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere
fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes
they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.

with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter
was in that nightâ€™s gazette and he made a show to find it about him
(for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on
stephenâ€™s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near
by which he did mighty brisk. he was a kind of sport gentleman that
went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women,
horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. to tell the truth he was mean

mother an orphan. the young manâ€™s face grew dark. all could see how hard
it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. he
would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed
the smart. madden had lost five drachmas on sceptre for a whim of the
riderâ€™s name: lenehan as much more. he told them of the race. the flag

cried, i am undone. but her lover consoled her and brought her a bright
casket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. a

walking by the hedge, reading, i think a brevier book with, i doubt not,
a witty letter in it from glycera or chloe to keep the page. the sweet
creature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a
slight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the
very trees adore her. when conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely
echo in that little mirror she carries. but he had been kind. in going
by he had blessed us. the gods too are ever kind, lenehan said. if i had
poor luck with bassâ€™s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more
propensely. he was laying his hand upon a winejar: malachi saw it and
withheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.
warily, malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. his soul is far
away. it is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
born. any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
incorruptible eon of the gods. do you not think it, stephen? th

the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. this therefore
was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute
man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious
proclivities as lord john corley.

taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.
not as much as a farthing to purchase a nightâ€™s lodgings. his friends
had all deserted him. furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called
him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other
uncalledfor expressions. he was out of a job and implored of stephen to
tell him where on godâ€™s earth he could get something, anything at all,
to do. no, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that
was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected
through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same
