if he only had paid some attention to hans olsa, who for a long while had insisted on waiting for him. but he had overruled all their objections; it was entirely his own doing that hans olsa and the others had gone on, leaving him behind.

but he soon had learned that it wasn't so easy. hadn't he lost his way altogether the other day, in the midst of a fog and drizzling rain? until lat

the only thing he felt sure of was that he wasn't on the right track; otherwise he would have come across the traces of their camps. it was getting to be a matter of life and death to him to find the trail--and find it soon. . . . a devil of a jaunt it would be to the pacific ocean--the wagon would never hold out that long! . . . oh yes, he realized it all too well--a matter of life and death. there weren't many supplies left in the wagon. he had depended on his old comrade and lofot-man,1 hans olsa, for everything.

per hansa heaved a deep sigh; it came out before he could stop it. . . . huh!--it was an easy matter enough for hans olsa! he had ample means, and could start out on a big scale from the beginning; he had a wife in whose heart there wasn't a speck of fear! . . . the lord only knew where they were now--whether they were east or west of him! and they had tönseten, too, and his wife kjersti,2 both of them

, well, the grade wasn't so steep that the oxen couldn't easily make it; there would be a bad jolt here at the edge, but after that they would have an even slope up the bank. . . . stepping out on the opposite shore, he stood as if rooted to the ground.

. . . "what in the devil . . . !"

per hansa bent over and picked up the object that lay before him; he held it out in the moonlight, turned it over and over in his hands, smelled of it . . . then took a bite.

. . . "by god! if it isn't one of hans olsa's dried mutton legs!"

he straightened himself up and gazed with deep thankfulness into the quivering bluish-green haze that glowed all around him. . . . "yes, that's the way it goes, when people have more than they can take care of!" . . . he stuck the mutton leg under his arm; whistling a love ballad of nordland, which seemed to have come into his mind unconsciously, he crossed the creek again.

on the way back he took his own time. nothing mattered now; the night was fair and mild; his achin

suddenly she could stand it no longer. she ran over to him, flung her arms around his neck, and leaned close against him. the dam of her pent-up tears broke in a flood of emotion; she wept long and bitterly.

"now calm yourself, dear. . . . you must calm yourself, beret-girl!" . . . he had put his arm lovingly around her, but found it hard to speak. . . . "don't you see that i've got one of hans olsa's dried mutton legs under my arm?" . . .

on the side of a hill, which sloped gently away toward the southeast and followed with many windings a creek that wormed its way across the prairie, stood hans olsa, laying turf. he was building a sod house. the walls had now risen breast-high; in its half-finished condition, the structure resembled more a bulwark against some enemy than anything intended to be a human h

was busy preparing the midday meal. she sang to herself as she worked. a ten-year-old girl, addressed by the woman as sofie, was helping her. now and then the girl would take up the tune and join in the singing.

less than a quarter of a mile away, in a southeasterly direction, a finished sod house rose on the slope of the hill. smoke was winding up from it at this moment. this house, which had been built the previous fall, belonged to syvert tönseten.

some distance north from the place where hans olsa had located, two other sod houses were under construction; but a hillock lay between, so that he could not see them from where he stood. there the two solum boys had driven down their stakes and had begun building. tönseten's completed house, and the other three half-finished ones, marked the beginning of the settlement on spring creek.

the woman who had been bustling about preparing the meal, now called to her husband that dinner was ready--he must come at once! he answered her, straightened

, because of the unobstructed sunlight beating down upon it. two beds were ranged along the wall, both of them homemade; a big emigrant chest stood at the head of each. nails had been driven into the centre pole of the tent, on which hung clothing; higher up a crosspiece, securely fastened, was likewise hung with clothes. two of the walls were lined with furniture; on these pieces the dishes were displayed, all neatly arranged.

a large basin of water stood on a chair just inside the tent door. hans olsa washed his face and hands; then he came out and sat down on the ground, where his wife had spread the table. it was so much cooler outside. the meal was all ready; both mother and daughter had been waiting for him.

"i suppose you haven't seen any signs of them yet?" his wife asked at last.

"no--nothing at all!"

"can you imagine what has become of them?"

"the lord forgive us--if i only knew!"

her husband looked so anxious that she asked no more questions. out of her kind heart rose a hopefu

over where he was. when he saw her coming, he tried to begin working as if there were nothing on his mind.

"hans," she said, quickly, when she had reached his side, "i think you ought to go out and look for them!"

he waited until he had got a strip of sod in place before he answered: "easier said than done . . . when we haven't the faintest idea where to look . . . on such stretches of prairie!"

"yes, i know; but it would make us all feel better, anyway . . . as if we were doing something."

hans olsa laid another strip of turf; then he stopped, let his hands fall to his sides, and began thinking aloud as he gazed off into the distance. . . .

"i know this much--you don't often find a smarter fellow than per hansa. . . . that's what makes it so queer! i don't suppose he's able to get much speed out of his oxen; but one thing i'm certain of--he has been hurrying as fast as he could. and we surely didn't come along very fast . . . but now it's the fifth day since we arrived here! if he made us

e of these bright moonlight nights, as he probably did, i begin to be afraid that he's gone on west of us somewhere, instead of being still to the eastward. . . . it's certainly no child's play to start looking for him!"

hans olsa slumped down on the wall, the picture of dejection. his wife quickly found a place beside him. together they sat there in silence. the same fear that she felt him struggling with, a fear thrown into sharp relief by the things he had just been saying, had long since gripped her heart also.

"i feel so sorry for beret, poor thing . . . and the children. you must remember, though, that he couldn't go very fast on account of her condition. . . . i think she is with child again!" she paused. "i drea

 direction of the house to the south of them. he had cheeks like two rosy apples, a quick step, and eyes that flitted all about; he was noted among them for his glib tongue and the flood of his conversation. with hands stuck into the waistband of his trousers, and elbows out akimbo, the man looked half as broad again as he really was.

"here comes tönseten," said the woman. "why don't you talk it over with him? i really think you ought to go out and look for them."

"seen anything of them yet, hans olsa?" asked the man, without further greeting, as soon as he arrived. . . . "well, well! this looks fine! ha, ha! it's a warm house, you know, that's built by the aid of a woman's hand."

hans olsa wheeled on him. "you haven't caught sight of them yourself, syvert, have you?"

"caught sight of them? why, man alive, that's just what i've come up here to tell you! i've had them in sight for over an hour now. seems to me you ought to be able to see them easy enough--you who carry your eyes so high up

te they're coming!"

"what's that you say?" the others burst out with one voice. . . . "where are they?" . . .

"i reckon per hansa must have got off his course a little. maybe the oxen didn't steer well, or maybe he didn't figure the current right. . . . look to the westward, neighbours! look over there about west-northwest, and you'll see him plain enough. . . . no need to worry. that fellow never would drown in such shallow water as this! . . . i wonder, now, how far west he's really been?"

hans olsa and his wife faced around in the direction that tönseten had indicated. sure enough, out of the west a little caravan was crawling up toward them on the prairie.

"can that be them? . . . i really believe it is!" said hans olsa in a half whisper, as if hardly daring yet to give vent to his joy.

"of course it is!" cried his wife, excitedly. . . . "thank god!"

"not the least doubt of it," tönseten assured them. "you might as well go and put your coffeepot on the stove, mother sörrina!1 that

1 the name properly is sörine, with the accent on the second syllable; but in the dialect of helgeland it is pronounced sörrina, with the accent on the first. these people all came from the district of helgeland, in norway.

 

"yes! heavens and earth, sörrina!" cried hans olsa, "fetch out the best you've got! . . . per, per, is it really you, old boy? . . . but why are you coming from the west, i'd like to know?"

tönseten coughed, and gave the woman a sly wink.

"look here, mother sörrina," he said with a twinkle in his eyes, "won't you be good enough, please, to take a peek at hans olsa's sunday bottle? . . . not that i want anything to drink, you understand--i should say not. good lord, no! but think of that poor woman out there, who has been suffering all this

time without a drop! and i'd be willing to bet that per hansa wouldn't object to having his stomach warmed up a little, too!"

at that they burst out laughing, from mingled joy and relief; but tönseten's laughter at his own joke was the loudest of all. . . . work was resumed at once; syvert began to carry the sods for hans olsa to lay up, while mother sörrina went off in a happy frame of mind, to make her preparations for the reception of the wanderers.

before the half hour allotted by tönseten had passed, the caravan came slowly crawling up the slope. per hansa still strode in the van, with store-hans at his side; ole walked abreast of the oxen, driving them with the goad. beret and and-ongen sat in the wagon. rosie came jogging along behind at her own gait; she gave a loud, prolonged "moo-o-o-o" as she

discovered the other animals across the prairie.

both families stood ready to receive them; hans olsa and sörine, tönseten and his kjersti, all watching intently the movements of the approaching company; but the girl couldn't possess her patience any longer, and ran down to meet the new arrivals. she took store-hans by the hand and fell in beside him; the first question she asked was whether he hadn't been terribly scared at night? . . .

as the slope of the hill grew steeper, the oxen had to bend to the yoke.

"hey, there, folks!" shouted per hansa, boisterously. "don't be standing around lo

"coffee time, coffee time, per hansa . . . ha, ha, ha!" tönseten was bubbling over with good spirits. "we thought we might as well wait a little while for you, you know."

. . . "you've found us at last!" said hans olsa, with a deep, happy chuckle. . . . he didn't seem able to let go of per hansa's hand.

"found you? why, devil take it, it's no trick to follow a course out here! you just have to keep on steering straight ahead. and you had marked the trail pretty well, all the way along. i found plenty of traces of you. . . . i guess we stood a little too far to the westward, between sioux falls and here; that's how it happened. . . . so this is the place, is it? . . . the pastures of goshen in the land of egy

folks we used to know. . . . how about it, you fellows?" he turned to the other two. "i suppose there's a little more land left around here, isn't there, after you've got through?"

"land? good god! per hansa, what are you talking about? take whatever you please, from here to the pacific ocean!" tönseten's enthusiasm got so far away with him that he had to pull one of his hands out of his waistband and make a sweeping circle with it in the air. "you must take a look around as soon as you can," hans olsa said, "and see if you find anything better that meets your fancy. in the meanwhile i've put down a stake for you on the quarter section that lies north of mine. we'll go over and have a look at it pretty soon. sam solum wanted it, but i told him he'd better leave it till you came. . . . you see, you would be next to the creek there; and then you and i would be the nearest neighbours, just as we've always planned. it makes no particular difference to sam; he can take the quarter alongside his br

other's."

per hansa drew a deep breath, as if filling himself with life's great goodness. . . . here hans olsa had been worrying about him, and with kindly forethought had arranged everything to his advantage! . . . "well, well, we'll have to settle all that later, hans olsa. for the present, i can only say that i'm deeply thankful to you! . . . unhitch the beasts, there, ola! . . . and now, if you folks have got anything handy, to either eat or drink, i'll accept it with pleasure."

. . . "or both, per hansa!" put in tönseten, excitedly.

"yes, both, syvert. i won't refuse!"

soon they were all gathered around a white cloth which mother sörine had spread on the ground. on one side of it lay a whole leg of dried mutton; on the other a large heap of flatbröd, wit

ion of the stove the breeze wafted to them a pleasant odour of fried bacon and strong coffee. mother sörine herself took charge of the ceremony, bringing the food and urging them all to sit down. the stocky figure of per hansa rocked back and forth in blissful delight as he squatted there with his legs crossed under him.

"come, sörrina, sit down!" he cried. "i guess we've fallen in with gentlefolks, by the looks of things around here. . . . i suppose you think you're old pharaoh himself--eh, hans olsa?"

"who do you call me, then?" inquired tönseten.

"you, syvert? well, now, i really don't know what to say. of course you'd like to be his majesty's butler, but you mustn't be encouraged--remember what happened to that poor fellow! . . . i think we'd better make you the baker--it might be safer, all around. what's your idea, hans olsa?"

by this time they were all laughing together.

in the midst of the jollification came sörine, carrying a plate with a large bottle and a dram glass1 on it .

 . . "here, take this off my hands, hans olsa--you will know what to do with it!"

 

1 this bottle and glass would have been old family pieces from norway, the bottle shaped something like an hourglass, with a contraction in the middle to be grasped by the hand.

 

tönseten fairly bubbled over in his admiration for her:

"oh, you sweet sörrina-girl!--you're dearer to my heart than a hundred women! . . . what a blessing it must be, to have a wife like that!"

"stop your foolishness!" said kjersti, but her voice didn't sound too severe.

for a long while they continued to sit around the cloth, chatting, eating, and drinking, and thoroughly enjoying themselves. hans olsa seemed like a different man from the one who had eaten here at noon. his loud voice led the cheerful talk; his ponderous bulk was always the centre of the merriment; it seemed as if he would never tire of gazing into that bearded, roguish face of per hansa's.

once, as per hansa was slicing off a piece of mutton, he regarded the cut thoughtfully, and asked:

"i suppose you brought all your supplies through safe enough?"

"oh, sure," answered hans olsa, innocently. "we had no trouble at all--did

as she looked at him--and loved him better for it. until that moment, she had supposed that she herself was the only one who felt this peculiar influence.

"such crazy talk!" he burst out. "i believe we've all lost our senses, every last one of us! here we sit around celebrating in broad daylight, in the middle of summer, as if it was the christmas holidays! . . . come on, woman, let's go over to our new home!"

everyone got up.

"you must do exactly as you please about it, per hansa," spoke up hans olsa with an apologetic air. "don't feel that you must take this quarter if you don't like it. but as far as i can see, it's as good a piece of land as you could find anywhere around--every square foot of it plowland, except the hill over there. plenty of water for both man and beast. . . . as for my part, if i can only sit here between you and syvert, i certainly won't be kicking about my neighbours. . . . but i don't want you to feel that you have to take this quarter on my account, you understand

"now, that's the talk!" tönseten chimed in, briskly. "and considering the size of the head it comes from, it isn't half bad, either. you're damned well right, hans olsa. before the snow flies you're going to see such a multitude swarming around these parts, that the thundering place won't be fit to live in! remember what i say, boys, in times to come--bear it in mind that those were syvert's very words! . . . you've got to go straight to sioux falls tomorrow morning, per hansa, and no two ways about it! if one of the solum boys can't go along to do the talking for you, why, i shall have to buckle down to the job myself."

e the prairie and look around, especially now, when the shades of evening were falling. . . . suddenly per hansa began to step more cautiously; he sniffed the air like an animal; in a moment he stopped beside a small depression in the ground, and stood gazing at it intently for quite a while; then he said, quietly:

"there are people buried here. . . . that is a grave!"

"oh no, per hansa! it can't be possible."

"no doubt about it," he said in the same subdued but positive tone.

tönseten and hans olsa were so astonished that they could hardly credit the fact; they came over at once to where per hansa stood, and gazed down into the hollow. hans olsa bent over and picked up a small stone that his eyes had lighted on; he turned it around in his hand several times. . . . "that's a queer-looking piece of stone! i almost believe people have shaped it for some use. . . . here, see what you make of it, syvert."

tönseten's ruddy face grew sober and thoughtful as he examined the object.

"by thunder

"i'm afraid so," said per hansa, with a vigorous nod. then he added, sharply, "but we needn't shout the fact from the house-tops, you know! . . . it takes so very little to scare some folks around here."

he waited no longer but walked hastily down the hill; at the foot he called to ole, telling him not to drive any farther; but first he turned to hans olsa to find out whether they were well across the line between the two quarters.

"no use in building farther away from you than is absolutely necessary," he said. "it's going to be lonesome for the women-folks at times." . . .

. . . awhile later, tönseten was dragging his way homeward. for reasons that he wouldn't admit even to himself, he walked a good deal heavier now than when he had climbed the slope that afternoon.

per hansa returned with his other neighbour to the wagons, where beret and

the children were waiting. again he inquired about the line between the two quarters; then asked beret and hans olsa to help pick the best building place; his words, though few and soberly spoken, had in them an unmistakable ring of determination. . . . this vast stretch of beautiful land was to be his--yes, his--and no ghost of a dead indian would drive him away! . . . his heart began to expand with a mighty exaltation. an emotion he had never felt before filled him and made him walk erect. . . . "good god!" he panted. "this kingdom is going to be mine!"

 the solum boys set out on the fifty-two-mile journey to sioux falls, where per hansa filed an application for the quarter-section of land which lay to the north of hans olsa's. to confirm the application, he received a temporary deed to the land. the deed was made out in the name of peder benjamin hansen; it contained a description of the land, the conditions which he agreed to fulfil in order to become the owner, and the date, june 6, 1873.

sörine wanted beret and the children to stay with her during the two days that her husband would be away; but she refused the offer with thanks. if they were to get ready a home for the summer, she said, she would have to tak

seized hold of her husband when he had first found the spot--here a human being lay buried. strangely enough, it did not frighten her; it only showed her more plainly, in a stronger, harsher light, how unspeakably lonesome this place was.

the evening dusk had now almost deepened into night. it seemed to gather all its strength around her, to close in on every side, to have its centre in the spot where she stood. the wagons had become only a dim speck in the darkness, far, far away; the tent at hans olsa's looked like a tuft of grass that had whitened at the top; tönseten's sod house she was unable to make out at all. . . . she could not bring herself to call aloud to the boys; instead, she walked around the hollow, spoke to them softly, and said that it was time to go home. . . . no, no, they mustn't take the stones with them to-night! but to-morrow they might come up here again to play.

front of her with a swaggering air:

"now let me tell you what came into my mind yesterday, after i had got the papers. i went right out and bought ten sacks of potatoes! i felt so good, beret--and you know how we men from nordland like potatoes!" he added with a laugh. "this is the point of it: we're not going to start right in with building a house. the others are just foolish to do it." his voice grew low and eager. "they're beginning at the wrong end, you see. for my part, i'm going over to hans olsa's this very night and borrow his plow--and to-morrow morning i shall start breaking my ground! yes, sir! i tell you those potatoes have got to go into the ground at once. do you hear me, beret-girl? if the soil out here is half as good as it's cracked up to be, we'll have a fine crop the very first fall! . . . then i can build later in the summer, you know, when i am able to take my time about it. . . . just wait, my girl, just wait. it's going to be wonderful; you'll see how wonderful i can ma

night a pleasant buoyancy seemed to be lifting him up and carrying him along; at dawn, when he opened his eyelids, morning was there to greet him--the morning of a glorious new day. . . . he saw that it was already broad daylight; with a guilty start, he came wide awake. heavens! he might have overslept himself--on this morning! . . . he jumped into his clothes, and found some cold porridge to quiet his hunger for the time being; then he hurried out, put the yoke on the oxen, and went across to hans olsa's to fetch the plow. . . . over there no life was stirring yet. well, maybe they could afford to sleep late in the morning; but he had arrived five days behind the others, and had just been delayed for two days more; they had a big start over him already. his heart sang as he thought how he would have to hurry! . . . he led the oxen carefully, trying to make as little noise around the tent as possible.

dragging the plow, he drove out for some distance toward the hillock, then stopped and looke

 had laboured hard and faithfully; well, they would get their wages in due time, every last one of them--but he couldn't bother with such trifles just now!

. . . that night sleep overpowered him at once; he was too tired even to dream.

from now on per hansa worked on the house every morning before breakfast, and every evening as soon as he had finished supper. the whole family joined in the task when they had nothing else to do; it seemed like a fascinating game.

to the eyes of tönseten and hans olsa, it appeared as if nothing short of witchcraft must be at work on per hansa's quarter section; in spite of the fact that he and his entire family were breaking ground in the fields the whole day long, a great sod house shot up beside the wagon, like an enormous mushroom.

per hansa plowed and harrowed, delved and dug; he built away at the house, and he planted the potatoes; he had such a zest for everything and thought it all such fun that he could hardly bear to waste a moment in stupid sleep.

however it was accomplished, on per hansa's estate they had a field all broken and harrowed and seeded down, and a large house ready for thatching, by the time that hans olsa and the solum boys had barely finished thatching their houses and started the plowing. tönseten, though, was ahead of him with the breaking--per hansa had to accept that--and was now busy planting his potatoes. but syvert had every reason to be in the lead; his house had been all ready to move into when they had arrived. that little stable which he had built wasn't more than a decent day's work for an able man. and he had horses, too. . . . of course, such things gave him a big advantage!

"oh, well, i suppose i'll have to, then," said per hansa, dryly.

as a matter of fact, it was hardly to be wondered at that tönseten grew excited when he saw this structure; it differed radically from the one he had built and from all the others that he had ever seen. he wondered if such a silly house as this could be found anywhere else in the whole country. . . . his own hut measured fourteen by sixteen feet; the one that the solum boys were building was only fourteen feet each way; hans olsa had been reckless and had laid his out eighteen feet long and sixteen feet wide. . . . but look at this house of per hansa's--twenty-eight feet long and eighteen feet wide! moreover, it had two rooms, one of them eighteen by eighteen, the other eighteen by ten. the rooms were separated by a wall; one had a door opening toward the south, the other a door opening toward the east. two doors in a sod hut! my god! what folly! in the smaller room the sod even had been taken up, so that the floor leve

wer on it, too!

things surely looked serious to tönseten. in the first place, per hansa plainly was getting big-headed; heavens and earth, it was nothing but an ordinary sod hut that he was building! in the second place, it wasn't a practical scheme. if he were to search till doomsday, he wouldn't be able to find enough willows for the thatching. why, he might just as well thatch the whole firmament, and be done with it! . . . as soon as he had looked his fill, tönseten trotted right over to hans olsa's, told him all about it, and asked him to go and reason with the man. . . . but, no, hans olsa didn't care to meddle in that affair. per hansa had a considerable family already, it might grow in the next few years; at any rate, he needed a fairly large house. above all, he wasn't the man to bite off more than he could chew.

"but that's just it--he doesn't know what he's bitten off! he doesn't know anything at all about building a house!" with these drastic words, tönseten went directly to th

to his great disappointment, the solum boys wouldn't go, either. it was per hansa's own business, they said, what sort of a house he wanted to build for himself. so tönseten had to give it up as a bad job. he shook his head solemnly. . . . a damned shame, that a perfectly good man had to

dark evenings and during the long winter nights. she shuddered, and answered her husband that it made no difference to her whichever way he built, so long as it was snug and warm; but she said nothing about the real reason that had changed her mind.

this answer made per hansa very happy.

"beret-girl, you are the most sensible woman that i know! . . . of course it's better all around, for us to build that way!"

he, too, had reasons that he kept to himself. . . . now he would get ahead of both hans olsa and the solum boys! none of them had even begun to think of building a barn yet; while according to his plan, his barn would be finished when his house was done.

one evening per hansa came over with his oxen to hans olsa's to borrow his new wagon; the time had come to get his poles for the thatching. the others had been able to gather what they needed along the banks of a creek some ten miles to the southward, where a fringe of scattering willows grew; but it was small stock and a sc

"we might as well keep this matter to ourselves, you know. besides, something has got to be done about getting fuel for the winter."

ing closer and closer upon them. they sat trying to pierce it with their gaze; but neither wagon nor oxen crossed the line of their vision. . . . ole took no interest in keeping watch; it was more fun for him to look for queer stones around the grave. . . . when the day was well-nigh dead and nothing had appeared, beret suddenly felt that she must talk to some one to-night . . . hear some human voice other than those of the two children. almost in spite of herself, she directed her steps toward hans olsa's.

--hadn't per hansa returned yet?

--no. she couldn't imagine what had become of him. he surely ought to have been home by this time.

--oh, well, she mustn't worry; he had probably travelled a long way on this trip; no doubt he had made use of the opportunity to look around for winter fuel.

--winter fuel? . . . she had never given a thought to that before; but of course they would need wood if they were going to stay through the winter. it suddenly occurred to her how much there was for pe

as time went on this first expedition of per hansa's came to be of great consequence to the new settlement on spring creek. . . . in the first place, there were all the trees that he had brought home and planted. this alone excited tönseten's enthusiasm to such a pitch that he was for leaving at once to get a supply of his own; but hans olsa and the solum boys advised him to wait until the coming fall, so tönseten reluctantly had to give up still another plan.

. . . but there were other things to do when fall came, and several years went by before the others had followed per hansa's lead. this is the reason why, in the course of time, a stout grove of trees began to grow up around per hansa's house before anything larger than a bush was to be seen elsewhere in the whole neighbourhood.

the food supply was steadily vanishing. bags and sacks yawned empty and had nothing to yield. the settlers shared freely with one another as long as they had anything left; but even at hans olsa's, where plenty usually reigned, the food at last began to give out. among the menfolk a crumb of tobacco was as rare as gold. . . . high time that they took the situation in hand and did something about it! besides, the season was getting so far advanced that they would soon have to start in haying. no two ways about it--they must make a trip to town.

all the men, accordingly--per hansa, and tönseten, and hans olsa, and the two solum boys--met together one sunday to discuss the matter. a tri

lized what this strange feeling was; none of them would have admitted that he was afraid.

. . . yes, god defend them! man's strength availed but little out here. they had already experienced it more than once. terrible storms would come up--so suddenly, with such appalling violence! . . . mother sörine had reason to be frightened of these storms. less than a week ago their tent had been carried away in one of them; sörine, trapped inside and half choked, had been swept along with the canvas. hans olsa had laid the tent rope across his shoulder, planted his feet solidly in the ground, and summoned all his giant strength; but he had been whirled away like a tuft of wool. it had turned out all right, however; no one was seriously hurt . . . this time.

and then, the indians! . . . "injuns," as the red children of the great plain were called in common speech. kjersti, tönseten's wife, didn't mind the storms so much; they never committed inhuman outrages . . . weren't out for your scalp, at any

ing with open mouths. . . . the grave where they found the stones had now begun to strike a chill into their hearts; but it also exerted a strange and irresistible fascination.

. . . so here they all were, afraid of something or other. but the women were the worst off; kjersti feared the indians, sörine the storms; and beret, poor thing, feared both--and feared the very air.

the outcome of their deliberations that sunday was only what might have been expected; it seemed the logical thing for hans olsa and tönseten and henry solum, each of whom owned horses and wagon, to make up the party for the journey. that would give three men and three separate teams; such a caravan ought to be able to haul home on one trip whatever the settlement could afford to buy.

per hansa was badly out of sorts that day; every word that he let fall had a bitter sting to it; he said little and sat morose and silent most of the time. in his eyes, the whole affair had the appearance of having been settled beforehand

but kjersti herself had seen the enemy; she must have been on the lookout, as usual. . . . at that moment she hove in sight on the slope of the hill, leading her cow.

at the same time ole arrived, with sörine and the girl close behind him; but sörine, unfortunately, hadn't thought of her cow, which was grazing off on the prairie to the westward, some distance from hans olsa's house.

soon they were all gathered in a little knot--the three women, ole, and the solum boy; but store-hans felt that it would be safer with his father, and had gone over to where per hansa was still working. . . . kjersti was moaning and wailing because her syvert was away at a time when the lord sent such tribulations upon her; mother sörine was comforting her as best she could, saying that, after all, indians were only people--human beings . . . just human beings! . . . beret listened i

the man he had chosen understood him perfectly. he gave a laugh, remarked something to the others, pulled a large leather pouch from his shirt, and held it out with a dignified gesture. per hansa grasped the pouch with an eager hand, took a deep dive into it, and gave his pipe a good fill. . . . "many thanks, good friend! if hans olsa happens to get back before you're gone, i'll see that you are well repaid! . . . hans, translate that to him the best way you know how. . . . what a thundering shame that we can't talk with such good folks!" . . . per hansa went over to the fire, raked out a glowing ember, lit his pipe, and pulled at it long and deeply, while an expression of rare contentment passed over his face.

certainly store-hans wasn't frightened any longer; this was the greatest experience he had ever had or ever expected to have. . . . he had already pressed his way through the throng when his father thought of something which he had forgotten, and called him back.

. . . "tell sörrina to go home and see if there isn't a drop left in hans olsa's bottle. even if it isn't more than a thimbleful, we ought to have it; it's a matter of life or death here. . . . and mother must bring some pepper. . . . let's see, now, how well you can remember everything!"

the boy was off like a flash. as soon as he had gone, per hansa began treating the hand. first of all, he made them understand that he needed water to wash his own hands. . . . "yes, water, water!" he said, going through the motion of dipping his hands and rubbing them. they caught his

s; as soon as he set it down, one of these rose to his feet with a jerk and sauntered in their direction; the other followed close at his heels.

"they're taking the bottle!" whispered beret, frightened at their manner.

per hansa whirled like a flash and caught hold of a brown arm; he grasped it firmly and gave it a violent twist. a howl of pain echoed through the camp. . . . "what the hell are you doing!" cried per hansa, wrenching loose the bottle with his other hand. "that bottle belongs to hans olsa. don't you dare to touch it!" he looked so fiercely at the pair that they slunk off, afraid.

"now come here and help me, woman! . . . hold this bottle, and let the liquor drip down on his hand while i rub it in. . . . right on the wound--only a drop at a time . . . god! did you ever see a nastier-looking hand?"

beret did as he told her, but her own hand was shaking violently. he looked at her closely. her face was flushed; tears hung in her eyes. . . . and all at once the loud ringing of bitt

during the first part of the night per hansa kept constant vigil over the sick man, frequently looking at his watch and changing the bandages; every time the hand was exposed he rubbed in a few more drops from hans olsa's bottle. it was evident from the man's face that the pain was growing no worse; he even slept at intervals.

midnight passed. the whole camp was now asleep; the men lay around like mummies, wrapped in their gaudy blankets, their feet towards the fire. occasionally one of them would rise and throw on more wood; per hansa noticed that it was always the same man. . . . the night was vast and still; the glow of the fire spread a strange light a little way around . . . beyond hovered impenetrable d

store-hans gave a leap into the air, turned a somersault, which immediately had to be repeated. never in his life had he felt so supremely happy. . . . then he and his brother ran over to claim the prize.

in the evening of the following day the loaded wagons arrived from town; they brought great stores of curiosities, and the men who drove them had many remarkable tales to tell.

hans olsa, who had carried fifteen dollars in cash from per hansa to buy merchandise with besides going surety for him for a plow and a horse rake, came first to their house to unload, before going home. there was a great mountain of bags and packages, sacks and boxes; but best of all were the plow and the rake. the latter, especially,--it was painted in such beautiful, rich colours, red, blue, and green; it looked so impressive standing there in the yard, with its seat reared high in the air . . . like

thing would do but store-hans must climb up and try it at once; he was wondering if they couldn't hitch their new pony to this wonderful rig! . . . still more marvellous things than this had come from town; but store-hans was fully occupied for a while and did not see them till later. over at tönseten's stood a mowing machine, which could cut both hay and wheat; this also had a seat high up in the air; and at the solum boys' the sights were equally remarkable.

there was a grand celebration at hans olsa's house that night. tönseten and per hansa arrived long before the others to have a talk together. they found much to do, and many important matters to discuss and settle. everything that had been borrowed during the past season must now be paid back, and that was a complicated affair; for at one time one kind of measure had been used, at another time another; they were all in the same boat. everyone owed everyone else--and now it was time to square the accounts. hans olsa, who during the shor

--yes, hans olsa would say that the man seemed to be a pretty decent sort of fellow; he spoke only english, however, so one couldn't get far with him in the way of talk; this was a bad piece of news for per hansa. his goods were fairly expensive, too; but one couldn't expect anything better out here. . . . on second thought, hans olsa seriously doubted whether it would be possible to get further credit from him. at the start of their dickering, the man wouldn't listen to a word of extending credit; but syvert h

the returned voyagers, however, thought that the folks at home had stranger tales than their own to tell. it seemed nothing short of a miracle that per hansa had been able to bring back to life an indian chief with one foot in the grave--those were the very words kjersti had used to her husband. tönseten swore that he had never heard anything so strange; by george! it was more exciting than any storybook ever written!

. . . "i declare, per hansa," said hans olsa, looking at him in open admiration, "it's a queer thing about you! no matter how hard you're put to it, you always give a good account of yourself! . . . i was dead set on having you go along with us this trip; we could have arranged it somehow, you know. syvert and i were speaking about it only the night before we left; but then we both decided that we could feel so much more comfortable about going away, knowing that you were here. . . . it was an act of providence, i say, to leave you home t

per hansa accepted their homage very modestly; he drew a deep breath and started to reply; but words failed him, and he had to begin all over again.

"oh, well--so much for that, boys. forget it, now! i didn't do anything out of the ordinary. but i might as well own up that when i told ole to get old maria i didn't have any courage to spare! . . . there came the band of indians, thirty strong or more--and here i stood, alone with three crazy women! . . . it looked like far from

 plain sailing, i can tell you!" . . .

"i don't doubt it a bit!" agreed hans olsa. "it's a wonder to me that you didn't take the women and try to run away!"

"yes, but where could i run to? besides, they had horses. . . . the women were crying and carrying on, you know. . . . and just then it crossed my mind, hans olsa, that if you were only near enough to sing out to--and you, too, syvert--i'd gladly have given my right hand, or both of them!"

"sam wasn't much use to you, eh?" asked tönseten.

"no, syvert, sam isn't quite equal to such a job." but then per hansa felt that he had been too harsh; he quickly added: "let's hope that he, too, will have guts some day. . . . the boy has plenty of good qualities. . . ."

meanwhile beret and kjersti had arrived; the solum boys turned up at last, and then they were

all gathered. the women had gone with sörine into her new house; they were curious to see what her husband had brought; she had to give both of them a taste from this bag and that. the menfolk remained sitting behind the barn; they had many weighty matters to discuss, and didn't want to be interrupted; just now the hay cutting seemed to be the all-absorbing topic. . . . per hansa's boys and hans olsa's girl were chasing one another around the sod hut, playing "indian."

it was a strange thing, however, the number of trips the men had to make into the barn to look at the window and door which hans olsa had brought. there must indeed be something very odd about that window and that door. the men never seemed to be done looking at them; they went in and came out--came out only to go in again; each time they reappeared they were laughing and talking more glibly. the children sneaked close to th

uff was--to-night they had good reason for rejoicing. she brought a glass, treated both of the neighbour women, took a wee drop herself, and then called in the men.

all five of the menfolk entered in a body and drew up in a close group at the door; at sight of the whisky they had suddenly become bashful and cautious.

"you shouldn't be handing around costly christmas treats in the middle of the haying season!" said tönseten, craftily. . . . "what sort of a housekeeper is this that you've got, hans olsa?"

"oh, come on, syvert!" laughed sörine.

--what, he? good gracious! no--he wouldn't have anything! he couldn't stand liquor right after supper, anyway. . . . she ought not to lead a weak brother into temptation!

but he was chuckling, and his four companions were chuckling with him.

per hansa pushed hans olsa forward.

"if you don't come at once and take this glass," said sörine with mock severity, "i'll pour it back into the bottle. . . . then you can stand there wishing for it as much as you please!"

. . . "hold on, there, sörrina--not so hasty, not so hasty! be careful with the blessings of the lord! . . . of course i'll sample it for you, if you've got to have it done!" . . . it was tönseten, after all, who had first spoken and co

"now, heave it in, syvert, so that the rest of us can have a whack before it gets too cold!" laughed hans olsa. "you've got to help me with that window, you know, before you leave to-night."

"right you are! . . . yes, right you are!" agreed tönseten, solemnly, and emptied the glass without more ado.

sörine treated them all. . . . and now the menfolk were sorry, but they really had no time to stay indoors; hans olsa needed all their help to get that window in before it came dark; and out they trooped in a body again, as soon as they had emptied their glasses. when the celebration was over and they fi

it was two days later that the great misfortune befell them. and according to the manner of such events, it came while everything seemed safe and serene and even the thought of ill luck was far away.

they had finished their afternoon lunch. hans olsa was cutting hay; his new machine hummed lustily over the prairie, shearing the grass so evenly and so close to the ground that his heart leaped with joy to behold the sight. . . . what a difference, this, from pounding away with an old scythe, on steep, stony hillsides! . . . all the men had gathered around to see him start; per hansa had returned home from that send-off firmly determined to get another cow for the winter, even if he had to steal one; for with such a machine it would be nothing

 can't understand it!" exclaimed sörine. . . . "can you?"

"they've run away!" cried kjersti is despair.

"of course they couldn't have sunk through the earth!" sörine was always a sensible woman in a crisis.

"oh, where are they?" wailed kjersti. "where have they gone?"

"we must tell the men this minute!" declared sörine, firmly. she saw that it was no use to waste time in waiting for her neighbour, leaving kjersti to look after herself, she hastened over to where her husband was working.

hans olsa pulled up the horses abruptly when he saw the two women straggling across the field.

. . . the cows? oh, nothing worse than that! . . . well, he hadn't seen hide nor hair of the cows; but they must be around somewhere. . . . he was in such spirits because of the smooth way the new machine was running, and of the ease with which they would now be able to get all the hay they needed, that he felt as if nothing could worry him to-day. . . . it was a sin how nervous these women were. good lord! th

 had gone around loose every day, and had invariably come home at milking time in the evening; they never had been in the habit of straying so far away that they couldn't be seen. . . . ole could distinctly remember having noticed them over by the creek, that very forenoon.

per hansa took the matter calmly and made a comforting suggestion; the cows were probably lying down in the tall grass, somewhere along the creek; they'd turn up safe and sound when it came milking time. . . . but just then hans olsa rode up with a very sober face and related that he hadn't seen a sign of life stirring on the whole prairie!

when hans olsa took it that way, and spoke so seriously, per hansa, too, began to get worried; he and the boys at once came down from the roof.

"take the pony, ola, and ride down to the creek. search upstream first, then turn and go south. if you don't see anything, you'd better notify the solum boys and tönseten." . . . per hansa still believed that the cows would come back all right

ans came? well, most likely they noticed it, too, and have come back here after them. that's where we'll have to look for our cows, my friends!" . . . sam spoke in a bold, convincing voice; now he had solved the riddle for them and felt very superior.

his idea at once gained general acceptance; it was at least a natural explanation. to the women it sounded very reasonable; they wondered why they hadn't thought of it themselves; for they had all seen how crazy the cattle acted that night. . . . hans olsa and tönseten pondered deeply over the problem for a while; they said nothing at first; this explanation had at least dispersed the feeling of weirdness that had gripped the colony; but the longer they thought, the more they realized that scant consolation lay in the theory that the indians had enticed the cattle away; for where could they find the indians, or how could they recover the cattle after they had been found? if they had stolen them, they meant to keep them--and keep them they could.

 back on the stove. . . . "a wrong thing!" she repeated with even more emphasis.

the vehemence of her tone took hold of him.

"perhaps it is," he answered, rather meekly. . . . "but we must try to get the cows back somehow, just the same."

"no more than the others!" she exclaimed, her agitation suddenly flaring up. . . . "if they can do without them, we can too!"

"but look here, beret," he reasoned, trying to calm her, "you know that it's necessary for some one to go and look for the cattle. hans olsa hasn't time to do it, because of the haying; and as for the others, i haven't much faith in them. . . . there aren't many to choose from here, you know."

"does it seem right to you, then," she burst out, wildly, "that i should be left alone here with the children while you are chasing around in the wilderness? . . . you may be gone for a day or a week--how can i know? . . . why can't sam or henry go? they have no one sitting at home waiting for them!" she did not look up from the floor while s

before he could make up his mind to jump into the saddle he heard footfalls behind him, and turned toward the house. it had flashed through his mind: here she is coming now; everything will be all right and i can be off at once. . . . i need to hurry!

but in the same flash he had realized that it wasn't from the direction of the door that the sound had come. . . . he turned to find hans olsa rounding the corner of the house. did hans olsa think of going? well, that was another matter; that man was equal to any task. but who would drive the mowing machine while he was gone? and it looked like fine weather for making hay--it seemed to be clearing. . . . all these thoughts passed through per hansa's head as he watched his neighbour draw near; he wished that hans olsa hadn't come just now . . . no, not just now! his usual frankness was lacking in his greeting:

"and so are you, i see. i sort of expected it; i wanted to talk to you before you went. . . . you're going, aren't you?"

"i know that you can ride faster than i can--that is the better reason. . . . guess what sörrina told me las

per hansa made no attempt at it; he wasn't in a mood to solve riddles just now. his eyes were on his neighbour, but his thoughts were in the house. . . . she must have heard their voices by this time. . . . would she come out?

. . . "well," said hans olsa, raising his eyebrows significantly, "yesterday morning sörrina suspected that cow of ours of wanting male company!"

per hansa came back to reality with a violent jolt.

"what's that you say, hans olsa?"

"those were her very words--'male company'! . . . do you suppose that old cow of mine could have taken it into her head to ramble all the way back to fillmore county, just for that--and the others followed her? . . . the idea occurred to me, anyway; and i thought it best to tell you at once, before you got away."

d behaved when the indians came, and when he had risen that morning he had been fully convinced that sam's solution of the riddle was the right and only one. to tönseten's mind, all that remained of the problem was how to get hold of the beasts again without causing bloodshed and war--how to wrest them from the possession of the redskins before they had gobbled them all up. . . . when he heard of per hansa's intended visit to the trönders, he spluttered with anger; he was disgusted, too, with hans olsa because he had not dissuaded him from such a brainless move. . . . but his anger at per hansa simply knew no bounds. so--he was not the courageous fellow, then, that he posed as being! didn't he know that the responsibility for getting the cattle back rested solely on him? for he had been the one who was so friendly with that robber brood. he hadn't chased them back where they had come from, as he should have done. oh no, he had taken gifts from them instead--and been gloriously fooled into the

he waste his time now, in revelling with the trönders on the sioux river? the man had better be made to understand that they needed their cows at once! . . . tönseten went about breathing fire and brimstone, and didn't care who heard him.

the gloom of this loss lay heavy upon the others as well; they went about their work as usual, but their eyes strayed elsewhere.

evening came, but neither per hansa nor the cattle. folks did not care to go to bed; they sat about staring and waiting. all of hans olsa's family went over to beret's; tönseten and kjersti, having first stopped at hans olsa's and found them out, went there, too. the solum boys could see no reason for moping around their hut alone; they soon joined the others. . . . but none of them found cheer in this place, either. beret seemed distant and strangely calm, as if the whole affair didn't in the least concern her. they wondered at her manner, it was so unnatural.

when they were leaving, however, she said, quietly, as if musing to

"come on--let's run and tell the others!" cried ole. . . . "mother first!" shrieked store-hans, forgetting that they had both been shouting the news. they jumped down from the roof together, jerked open the door, and announced in one breath that their father was coming; the next instant they were gone. the word was first carried to hans olsa, then to tönseten, last of all to the solum boys. in each place the same message: "dad is coming!"--that from ole. . . .

and now he laid his course to the northward, walking slowly. the radiant, happy look had vanished from his face; it looked old and worn. all at once, as if struck by a new thought, he quickened his pace. he hurried on until he had reached the vicinity of hans olsa's south line, dividing his land from tönseten's; here he began to search the ground, first to the eastward, then to the westward, working slowly forward into the next quarter-section.

at last he found it--another stake, hans olsa's southwest corner! . . . he looked carefully around; no one was in sight. then he fell on his knees and examined the stake; he didn't bother to glance at the description this time; but the name--the name! tears suddenly came to his eyes as he stooped over; for an in

stant he found it hard to see. . . . but there it was, exactly as he had feared; this stake had joe gill carved on it . . . joe gill, when it should have been h. p. olsen! . . . he got up at last; his round, jovial face now looked drawn and sinister.

moving mechanically, he strode toward the north until he had reached the line between hans olsa's quarter and his own; there he repeated his tactics of a while before, zigzagging back and forth over a broad space; but though he kept tacking around for a long time, he was unable to locate any stake. that a stake was there, however, he felt very certain; it was unthinkable that this misfortune should have befallen both tönseten and hans olsa, and not have run him down at the same time. . . . he searched until he had to give it up in despair; then he went north to the line between himself a

as soon as he had eaten he left the table, telling the boys to come along and help him; now was a good time to pace out the west line of their land; it had to be done soon, anyway; perhaps they would break a stretch of ground out there. . . . his words sounded cold and distant; he went out, and said no more.

beret watched him narrowly. . . . there's certainly something the matter with him, she thought.

striking west from the house, per hansa paralleled his own south line, between his land and hans olsa's; he knew exactly how far in from this line the house had been built; so he merely kept along with it, counting the paces. when he had reached the western limit of his quarter, he stood still; the grass had been trampled down all over the place. . . . "this is where it ought to be; the line should run straight north from here." . . . he walked a few paces north to show them the direction. . . . "there ought to be a small black stake driven down in the grass here somewhere, but i can't seem to

o the other way. keep your eyes open, now, every step!"

"when did you put a stake down here?" asked ole.

his father apparently didn't hear him. . . . "it ought to be right here; funny, that we can't find it! . . . the cattle must have tramped it into the ground."

all three of them kept searching steadily the whole forenoon; the father seemed so excited, and walked so fast, that the boys could hardly keep up with him. they made tack after tack, north until they stood on henry's land, south to hans olsa's; they did not go in single file, but walked abreast, four or five paces apart.

. . . "look in the grass, boys--look carefully in the grass!" the father repeated a thousand times.

whenever they reached the end of the line they zig-zagged east and west; they looked everywhere, and combed the ground; but with all their labour and painstaking care, no stake could be found. the boys noticed something very odd about their father's manner: the longer their search went on unsuccessfully, the less i

ed so strangely that she did not dare to call again. the sound died away unheeded. . . . it seemed to beret that she had never felt the awful desolation of the place weigh so heavily upon her as on this morning.

in the meantime per hansa was engaged in a very curious task west on the prairie. he had risen before daylight; had gone out and hunted up the spade, which he had stuck under his arm; then he had started off in a general westerly direction. he made a longer detour than necessary around hans olsa's house, watching closely as he went by to see if anyone there was up and stirring; once safely past, he quickened his gait. . . . so he came to a place at the southwest corner of hans olsa's land, where a black imp stood nodding sleepily in the grass; there he came to a halt and looked about in all directions. . . . not a soul to be seen. his eyes were snapping now; his mouth was tight and drawn; all his features seemed hardened into solid rock. . . . "god!" he muttered, "hans olsa has got him

st he brought some loose soil from a distance in the spade, and filled the hole almost to the top; next he stopped it up with a sod plug; the grass of the plug grew as stout and green as that around it; he also took good care not to tramp down the grass near the hole, placing his feet lightly, as if he were afraid to rest his full weight on them.

at last he had finished and stood regarding his handiwork. . . . "if they only give the grass time to grow a little. i'll be damned if they can chase hans olsa away on account of that stick of wood!" . . . then per hansa went on to the place when he had found the stake of tönseten's land; here he repeated the performance, but was even more careful not to trample down the grass.

when he returned home that morning he did not arrive from the west, but from the north. the boys were eating breakfast; the mother was busy, but she kept a watch through the window; she saw him come into the yard, stop by the woodpile and throw down the spade--then pause and

during the weeks that followed, per hansa's temper made him hard of approach; the man seemed driven by a restless energy, an indomitable will that knew but one course--to break as much new land as possible each day. . . . "do you intend to break the whole quarter-section this fall?" hans olsa asked him more than once. he had broken a large part of it already; a new piece was added every day; but still he found no rest, nor would the joyous peace of the early summer return to him. . . . his face now always wore that forbidding, menacing look, which often would flare up into a flame, and his voice would suddenly be hard as flint.

before his thoughts stood ever the same problem: how would it turn out when the trolls came? would he be able to hack off their heads and wrest the kingdom

 that might have happened.

. . . but no, the explanation didn't sound reasonable; those stakes hadn't stood in the ground all winter--they didn't look that way. . . . by god! the trolls had arrived after tönseten's sod house had been built; they had "beheld the land, and seen that it was good"! . . . so, there was nothing to do but wait for them to come back. . . . not by a breath or a syllable did per hansa betray the secret of what he had done. at one time he had strongly considered telling hans olsa, but had finally given up the idea; better to keep him out of this for the time being! . . . in all this trouble, it never once occurred to him that had there been a prior claim on these quarters, tönseten and hans olsa couldn't have filed on them, and that the act of putting down claim stakes made no difference at all.

beret's thoughts continued to spin; the web had grown so dreadful to look at that she longed to cast it aside; but lacked the power. . . . he has done it, he has done it!--the

ar away; as he watched it came creeping closer; the boy was so startled that he could hear the beating of his own heart; he had to investigate this thing. the pony was fleet-footed; he had plenty of time to make a turn to the eastward; he rode directly toward the speck. when he had satisfied himself that west-movers were coming--the wagons indicated that--he turned toward home and urged the pony till his body lay flat to the ground. on the way in he stopped at tönseten's with the news, then at hans olsa's; hastening on to his own house, he shouted loudly for them to come out and look . . . come out in a hurry!

. . . what a strange feeling it gave them! . . . two horses in front of a wagon; the wagon covered, just like their own! . . . and like their own, it came slowly creeping out of the eastern haze; like them, these folks were steering for sunset land. . . . alas! thought beret, some one else has been led astray!

the wagon held on toward tönseten's; it reached his place and halted. the i

the hand, and joined the others. . . . the whole colony, young and old, were gathered there when she arrived--everyone except per hansa. . . . he came up silently at last, carrying a heavy stick.

the company consisted of four men; they were from iowa. . . . no, they didn't intend to stop here; they were bound for a place about seventy miles to the southwest; the land was nearly all taken up around here, they had been told. . . . tönseten and the solum boys were convening with them in english; hans olsa, together with the women and children, stood respectfully listening; as for per hansa, he was all eyes and ears, scrutinizing the four visitors from head to foot, trying to make out what they were saying. . . . his grip on the stick relaxed; hadn't he understood that they were going seventy miles farther? . . .

at last he grew impatient, because he was unable to follow the conversation as well as he wished; he grasped tönseten by the arm and pinched it so hard that he turned around angrily; b

 wandering fellow beings. . . . this visit had encouraged them all, but tönseten and his wife were especially firm and optimistic in their faith; from now on syvert always spoke of the future with fervent conviction, and kjersti went about listening to him in a glow of silent but none the less ardent devotion. the solum boys also had little doubt of the omen--this wagon was only the forerunner of more to come! the next in order of enthusiasm was sörine, to whom faith imparted a glad calmness. hans olsa let every day be sufficient unto itself, enjoyed the confident spirits of the others, and set himself every day to accomplish something needful; he was not a fast worker, but got things done with a peculiar sureness of purpose and steadiness of gait; it did not seem of great importance to him how many new people came; the important thing was how they got along--the folks who were here already.

per hansa was even louder in his optimism than tönseten. now there were settlers to both the east an

relling over who should ride to meet the strangers; but the father suddenly came and told them both to stay at home; he spoke in such a determined voice that they understood it would be useless to mention the matter again. . . . they shouldn't be running out to meet every stranger, he went on, as though they had never seen people before! time enough to speak with these newcomers to-morrow. he was going over now to find out if they needed any potatoes. . . . he suited the action to the word.

at hans olsa's house the caravan had not yet been sighted; per hansa saw a light in the window as he passed. tönseten was standing outside when he arrived there; the caravan lay some distance off to the southward, steering too far west to fetch the settlement.

"you're going to have visitors," per hansa greeted his neighbour.

"it looks that way!" chuckled tönseten. . . . "though i'm afraid they're heading a little too far west."

they stood gazing at the train of wagons, now less than a hundred yards awa

camping here for the night.

"you'd better go over and talk to them, syvert," said kjersti. . . . "we'll make room for them somehow."

tönseten gazed at them open-mouthed; tears of disappointment stood in his eyes. . . . "that's a fine way to act!" he spluttered. . . . "hadn't we better go over and invite them?"

per hansa's eyes flashed daggers; his face lighted up with irresistible forcefulness. . . . "we won't bother about that just yet. . . . they might be high-toned, you know--heading for hans olsa's place, or mine!"

the train moved slowly on toward the northwest, until it was on the line between hans olsa's and tönseten's; there the wagons stopped and the horses were unhitched; the newcomers had evidently decided to pitch their camp for the night.

. . . "it's the strangest thing i ever saw!" said tönseten, as if speaking to himself. "can you imagine anyone coming into a neighbourhood where the houses are standing around as thick as fleas on a dog's back, and not even wanting to talk 
 
 ___________________________
 
d visit them. we might even talk them into buying some potatoes--eh? we must watch our chances, you know." . . . he was anxious to get a look at them.

tönseten could see no particular objection, especially since per hansa had an errand with them; but it did seem rather humiliating to go and shake hands with folks who had refused to say "hullo" to them. . . . but after a moment they started on their way.

they had walked only a few steps, however, when he drew up with a jerk. "let's go over to hans olsa's and take him along; he'd like to shake hands with them too, you know."

--not at all--certainly not!--was per hansa's decisive reply. hans olsa knew no more english than he did; and it was devilish awkward to stand around and stare strangers in the face, without knowing a word they said; he himself would never have thought of going if it hadn't been that they ought to make use of the opportunity to sell some potatoes! . . .

they went on a few steps farther, and then tönseten stopped again;

his courage was dripping away. . . . suppose they were scandinavians?

--what nonsense! . . . per hansa kept right on walking. neither swedes nor danes behaved in that boorish fashion; anyway, they probably had all gone to bed at hans olsa's; they always turned in early there.

the fire burned lustily over on the prairie; four women went to and fro placing dishes of food on a big green cloth spread on the ground; some of the men had already gathered around it; others were occupied with the wagons. . . . as they drew near, per hansa counted ten men in all; he scrutinized their faces closely, one by one; but he found none that he liked. . . . tönseten went briskly up to the fire and greeted those who were sitting around; per hansa

 and that the men were making sport with tönseten, who had grown angry and now spoke still faster. . . . it was unbelievable how fast syvert could rattle off the english! . . . the strangers' mockery was getting rather ugly now; he could tell it by the sound of their laughter. . . . damn it all, to think that he couldn't talk to them!

"huh!" exclaimed tönseten, turning suddenly to his neighbour . . . "can you imagine what they are saying? . . . they . . . they insist that both my quarter and hans olsa's belong to them!"

"you don't say! . . . what about mine?"

but tönseten paid no further attention to him; he was off again in his squabble with the irishmen, and growing more and more excited with every word. . . . it struck per hansa that if syvert didn't stop a moment to catch his breath, he was either going to explode, or else he would burst into tears; he grasped his arm firmly.

"what do they say, syvert?"

"they say they've taken up all the land between the creek and the swamps over to

 on them, if you want to. . . . but let me tell you this, my good syvert: with these people you can't use either the 'catechism' or the 'epitome'; they don't live according to the scriptures!" . . .

tönseten drew a long and heavy sigh. . . . "my god! what troubles a man may fall into! . . . it makes me shudder to think how wild they talked!"

when they parted it was agreed that all the menfolk should meet early next morning, to counsel together as to what must be done. per hansa was to notify hans olsa and the solum boys, and bring all three over to tonseten's.

"don't breathe a word to kjersti about how things are!" per hansa warned him. . . . "if the women ever get hold of this, they'll die of fright! . . . we'll find a way out somehow--i tell you we will!"

as he walked homeward per hansa was a totally different man from the one who had gone over to tönseten's a couple of hours before. then he had carried a heavy burden of worry and care; but now he walked with a lightsome, bu

ent to bed later in the evening he put his arm lovingly around her and fell asleep almost immediately. . . . she felt sure there could be no danger this time.

but before she was awake, and long before the faintest light of day shone into the room, per hansa was up again; he ate some cold porridge left from the night before, put the deed into his pocket, and went over to the solum boys' place; there he roused them, and waited till they had eaten a mouthful or two; then all three continued on to hans olsa's.

as they walked along per hansa reviewed the situation for them; with the help of their questions, he gradually explained his plan:

"it's this way, boys: there's no danger for any of us three; our neighbours are the ones who are in trouble and stand in need of help; but as for that, you realize as well as i do that we wouldn't have a very pleasant future ahead of us, either, if they were chased away from here. . . . now, you're a pretty good talker, henry, and had better be spokesman for th

 ___________________________
 
 can!"

the solum boys took a sensible view of the whole matter; to henry it seemed just an amusing interruption to their loneliness; the idea of chasing people away from a place that was nearly destitute of human beings already, seemed comical. . . . even sam was brave to-day; these were white folks, with whom one could talk and reason; that wasn't so dangerous! . . .

per hansa told them to keep on to tönseten's; he and hans olsa would come as soon as they could.

everything about hans olsa was of unusual dimensions; his great body made strangers stop and look; it loomed up like a mountain when he rose to his full height; his strength was in proportion to his bulk; things that he took hold of often got crushed in his grip. new ideas found their way behind that big forehead with great difficulty; he had to look at a thought for some time before he could comprehend it; on the other hand, it invariably held true that when an idea had once become well lodged in there, it would remain

changed and must not be tampered with; right was right, and wrong was wrong; thus it had always been, and thus it must remain as long as the world should stand.

when per hansa entered his neighbour's house that morning, he found himself immediately embarrassed; both husband and wife were up, and he did not care to speak of their predicament while sörine was listening; the women ought to be kept out of this! time was pressing, however, and he couldn't waste it in lengthy explanations; besides, hans olsa and his wife had already discovered the camp to the westward and were planning to go over and visit the strangers, with tönseten as an interpreter. . . . per hansa hardly knew which way to turn; he looked at sörine's face, and again, as so often before, was impressed by the goodness and intelligence in it; then he made up his mind and related frankly the whole experience which had befallen him and tönseten the night before.

. . . "now, sörrina, i know you are a sensible woman and will keep

 your mouth shut," he added, quickly, when he was through. "beret doesn't know anything about this, neither does kjersti; there's no need of alarming folks who are in a bad way already. . . . not that we need to worry over this business; i'm sure they'll take it peaceably when we show them our papers. . . . now we must hurry. get your deed, hans olsa!"

but it was a sheer impossibility for hans olsa to hurry in a matter of this kind; he had to ask about it over and over again. facts were facts, which in this case were clear beyond questioning: he himself had gone to the land office in person; tönseten had put his finger on precisely this quarter-section on the map, and had asked in hans olsa's name if it could be taken up; there had been nothing in the way, not the slightest claim; it was so stated in the document; and he had moved directly on to his land and had done everything that the

law prescribed. if anything was wrong, the government would have to clear it up; but how could anything possibly be wrong? . . .

"why, certainly," said per hansa, with shrewd common sense. . . . "the government is all right in its place--no one questions that! but out here this morning, the government is a little too far away . . . that's where the trouble comes in."

"you don't mean that they actually intend to kick us out?" demanded hans olsa in an astonished voice, unconsciously stretching his huge frame.

"that's just what they intend to do, as i understand them. . . . we'll have to show them where we stand, in black and white!" . . . per hansa looked at the woman.

"you don't say, per hansa! are there . . . are there many of them?"

"i counted ten men and four women; i believe that's all there are." . . . the ghost of a smile passed over per hansa's face.

hans olsa sat in silence for a while, with the deed folded up in his hand:

had kept his part of the contract to the letter of the law. he handed the paper to per hansa, and said in a ponderous voice:

"do you see anything wrong there?"

per hansa was growing impatient; here they sat, wasting precious time; his laugh had a hard, short ring:

"no! it isn't you who are wrong in this case, you see; it's those devils who have squatted here on your land!"

"do they look like peaceable folks?" asked sörine, calmly.

"one would suppose so . . . they have their women along!"

hans olsa spoke slowly: "we'd better go over and talk to them."

"that's the idea! . . . just put the deed in your pocket, and let's get started!"

tönseten and the solum boys were waiting impatiently when the others arrived. later on, tönseten let it out that he had told his wife the whole story as soon as he had come home the night before; neither of them had slept a wink all night. he was nervous and jumpy this morning, and wanted to start out immediately.

"no, this won't do," said per han

sa, firmly. "we mustn't go without a plan. how are we going to tackle the business when we get there?"

"we've got to drive them away from here!" cried tönseten, excitedly.

"fine! . . . but the question is: how are we going about it?"

"we've got to convince them that we are here with the full sanction of law and justice," said hans olsa, solemnly.

"you're damned right we must!" flashed per hansa. . . . "have you got your paper, syvert?"

--no, tönseten had thought of bringing the deed with him, but he feared it would be too risky. . . . "they might take it away from me, and then i'd be in a devil of a hole!" tönseten's face was so agitated that it was a pity to look at.

but per hansa now took charge in a determined manner. . . . "go in and get that deed immediately, syvert, so that we can get going! . . . don't worry--we'l

l see to it that no one molests you!"

and so they started. on the way over, per hansa explained the tactics they were to follow; henry solum and tönseten should be the spokesmen, sam the interpreter; per hansa took pains to impress upon sam how important it was that he translate correctly and rapidly, so that he and hans olsa could keep abreast of proceedings. . . . "i think it will be best for you, henry, to cut loose; then you, syvert, can put in your oar when you think it's needed. but don't say much; and for heaven's sake, be careful not to talk too fast; you know how quickly you get short-winded. remember we have the whole day ahead of us!"

tönseten was highly displeased with this plan of per hansa's, but he lacked the strength to protest; matters had reached such a bad pass already that they could hardly get

 worse. . . .

it was plainly evident that the strangers had not overslept themselves that morning; although the hour was still very early--full daylight had barely come--all hands were busily at work when the five settlers reached the camp. two of the wagons had already been unloaded; a few of the men were beginning to open up the others, while the rest of the crew were putting up a large tent.

per hansa and henry solum walked ahead; then came hans olsa and sam; tönseten, who at first had trotted along with the van, had now quietly dropped back to the rear.

"ah-ha!" observed per hansa to his companions. "they're planning to settle here, it seems! . . . now, first you must ask to see their papers; and then the stakes--insist on the stakes! talk pleasantly to begin with . . . but it won't do any harm to have a little sport with them, you know. if they get ugly, just tease them on awhile."

their friendly greetings were returned in a churlish f

ashion; the strangers didn't seem anxious for company; each man went about his task without paying the slightest attention to the visitors.

--what were they doing here? henry demanded.--this quarter had been taken up long ago.

--indeed? two of the men stopped their work and entered the conversation.

--yes, the man who owned the land was standing right there--henry pointed to hans olsa.--that fellow; he had his papers along, too; and now they must show their papers! if the land office had granted the same quarter-section to two different men, a bad mistake had been made, but it could easily be cleared up.

--well, so they wanted to see the papers--was that the idea? had they brought their spectacles? a roar of laughter from the others greeted this sally; but the man who had spoken wasn't exactly laughing--he held his head tilted on one side, his whole face screwed into an ugl

 would have to wait awhile to look at them; but he would show them the stakes! they'd better come right along with him now; he was in a devil of a hurry; he had both plowing and building to do before the snow flew.

the stranger began to walk rapidly westward; per hansa was right at his heels; as they hurried on, he breathed a prayer that the grass might have sprung up freshly where he had done that little piece of work! . . .

the man seemed very certain about his direction. as they approached hans olsa's southwest corner, he slackened his pace and began pushing the grass aside with his foot; per hansa had in the meanwhile discovered with his eyes the exact spot where the stake had stood. he all but laughed aloud; indeed, the rain and the sun of the good lord had done their work well; not a blade of grass seemed displaced, not a broken stalk could be seen! . . . besides, the man was mistaken about the location of the spot; he had gone too far to the north and west before he got down on his kne

ked more slowly and cautiously. . . . he was swearing like a trooper now; per hansa knew enough english to understand most of it; he didn't wonder that the fellow felt moved to say a little something, under the circumstances. . . .

at last the searcher got up and called loudly to the others. . . . a man came over from the camp--a small man with reddish hair and a face as freckled as a moor dotted with heather. they began to talk together in low tones, from time to time casting angry glances at hans olsa; they searched the whole region again, but found no trace of what they were looking for.

hans olsa made strenuous efforts to take in what was happening; his big, rough-hewn face, with the rugged features that ordinarily were the picture of trust and honesty, had become strange to behold. he gazed at these two men, hurrying here and there, trying to prove that he was a scoundrel; he heard what sam managed to translate of their complimentary remarks about him; and it all seemed to awaken a new a

ed-faced man stepped out from the group, evidently their leader. . . . "god be with you, henry. . . . stand right up to him and talk him down!" per hansa whispered to the solum boy. . . . it was clearly evident from the man's face that a storm was brewing; the fact that the big irishman carried a sledge hammer in his hand also attracted per hansa's attention.

"where are the men who claim to have taken up this land?" he snapped at them.

--right there, those two!--henry pointed to tönseten and hans olsa.--that one--tönseten--owned the quarter to the south; this one--hans olsa--the one they now stood on.

the irishman singled out hans olsa and looked him up and down.

--what was the matter with that fellow--was he deaf and dumb? he couldn't seem to get his mouth open! the man fingered his sledge hammer, and glared around at henry as if he would swallow him up.

--oh no, hans olsa had his faculties, all right! he just couldn't talk english.

sam was translating all this as best he could.

--wel

thief and a blackguard who had destroyed another man's landmarks!

sam translated rapidly, trembling with fear.

the irishman came closer.

--if the whole damned gang of sneaking swine didn't get off their land right away, he'd give them something to start with!--perhaps they'd understand that language better!--the man swung his sledge hammer.

"look out, now!" shouted per hansa. "here the trouble starts!" . . .

and so it did, only much faster than he or any of the others had anticipated. when hans olsa saw the irishman loom up before him in that threatening attitude, he stared at him blankly, and stood for a moment as if rooted to the ground. then, all of a sudden, the upper part of his body seemed to stretch; he stepped aside to evade the onslaught . . . his left fist shot out and struck the man below the ear. there was a crashing sound; with a loud groan the man sank in a heap and lay perfectly still.

"look out there, henry!" cried per hansa. . . . "see that you get your man, and i'll get

mine! . . . wait a minute!"

the crowd had drawn back in front of one of the empty wagons; they stood as if dazed. hans olsa stared at them wildly, took a step forward, and stumbled over the heap on the ground. regaining his balance, he stopped, bent over, and plunged both hands into the inert heap of flesh; the next instant he lifted it high in the air and flung it bodily over the heads of the crowd, where it crashed into the wagon standing behind. the wagon shook violently at the impact. . . . at the same moment the group scattered and took to their heels southward across the prairie. from one of the wagons, still

covered by its canvas, sounded a scream of terror; four women came tumbling out and followed after the men.

hans olsa stood motionless, quivering in every muscle; he seemed like a man half stunned.

per hansa jumped to his side and slapped him on the shoulder:

"goodness! hans olsa, that was beautiful! i don't believe there's another man in the whole country who could do such a thing! . . . now i think we can safely go home; those folks aren't likely to start any more arguments about land!"

hans olsa was slowly regaining his natural poise; he stroked his face and sighed deeply, like one recovering from an attack of delirium.

"i'm afraid i handled him pretty roughly; you'd better go and look at him, per hansa."

per hansa laughed confidently. . . . "no, leave him alone; just do as i say, now! we're going straight home, the whole lot of us. . . . later in the day i'll take a little trip of my own out westward!"

they did as he bade them--though tönseten could not be found anywhere; he had v

anished from the scene long before. in the latter part of the afternoon per hansa returned to the camp of the irish, to find out what they were doing and how they were getting along; he took store-hans with him as interpreter. . . . he found the whole camp moved to one of the two quarter-sections lying west of tönseten's and hans olsa's land.

per hansa made frequent visits to them during the next few days; before the third day was over, he had sold them more than ten dollars' worth of potatoes; he felt that he had struck up a profitable business.

 

the irish finally settled on these two quarters west of them. they returned east to iowa just before the snow fell in the fall; but early the following spring they came back with a large company, and started their permanent settlement.

 gone out to parley with the irish, kjersti was left all alone in the house. she felt gloomy and depressed; there had been little or no sleep for either of them during the night; syvert had tossed to and fro in bed, telling and retelling the same unhappy story--of the terrible folks who had come, of what they proposed to do, and of the dreary future that awaited him and hans olsa, who would now be forced to start everything anew. . . . perhaps they had better just move east again, and be done with it! he had lain twisting and turning as he bemoaned their fate, his mood steadily growing gloomier and gloomier. . . . this had kept up so long that it had driven her nearly distracted; at last she had grown tired of his everlasting whimpering and had told him so in plain words. as yet, she pointed out, no one in the settlement had lost either life or limb; their papers were a

er the men had left that morning; kjersti kept the coffeepot on the stove, and laid on a couple of fresh sticks of wood; he would be sure to look in for a drop when he came back! . . . then she put on syvert's old hat and went over to see beret; she wanted to find out what per hansa had told her when he came home the night before.

she got little information or comfort there, however. . . . first she recounted most of what tönseten had let out to her--that people had arrived who claimed to own hans olsa's land, as well as his own; that these people wouldn't listen to reason, so in all probability they would have to seek the aid of the law. . . . hadn't per hansa told her what had happened?

the boys were eating their breakfast; beret sat over by the stove, dressing the child; she made no answer to kjersti; her face flushed but she did not look up.

 rest were phantoms of his own terror; he enlarged on certain points in his narrative very fully--especially the awful language which the irish had used, and the effective replies which he had made to them. the general impression given by his story was that in all probability he would have brought the irish around all right, if per hansa and henry solum hadn't stirred them up to fight; they had done just exactly the wrong things. and so a big ruffian had rushed forward with a sledge hammer; and hans olsa had gone into a mad rage and killed the man! from now on there would be nothing but war and bloodshed; so they might as well pack up and move right away! what a tragedy it was! . . .

tönseten stayed safely in bed until late in the afternoon; then kjersti came and told him that the strangers had gone. he got up immediately to see if it was true. . . . after that he seemed quite like himself again.

for a long time the irish were the standing topic of discussion in the little settlement.

. . . no, she knew one who could not endure it forever out here!

one afternoon a few days later the irish came over to per hansa's to buy more potatoes; they stayed for some time and asked for information on various matters; the boys translated the questions to their father as well as they could; per hansa thought the irish were excellent folk!

at both tönseten's and hans olsa's they had noticed the strangers come and go; in the evening they all went to per hansa's to learn how the irish had behaved.

. . . "finest people in the world!" per hansa assured them, pacing the floor, uplifted by a surge of high spirits that somehow had to find an outlet. no sooner did he sit down than he was up again; his sallies of humour had a dashing quality that made them positively contagious. tönseten was in a continual gale of hilarity; kjersti and sörine, who sat on the big bed w

f how he had found them, of what he had thought, and of the way he had finally disposed of them. he related the story in a loud voice, with boisterous, care-free zest; he made it sound exactly like a fairy tale. . . . many words of praise were bestowed on his wise action; tönseten was especially effusive--there was a neighbour for you! as for kjersti, she was moved almost to tears over such a man. what a difference from that spineless jellyfish of a husband of hers!

"i'll have to admit," said hans olsa, soberly, "that you played a risky game; and it was the hand of the lord that kept you from telling. for if they had been able to show that their stakes had ever been on my land, we'd probably be building a new house now, somewhere out to the westward. all our work this summer would have been for others. . . . my thanks to you, per hansa!"

as beret listened to the tale, she had to examine the narrator closely; surely this couldn't be per hansa! she remembered the morning when he had brought th

facing the great desolation

 

i

 

in the beginning of october a memorable event stirred the little spring creek settlement. this, the greatest happening of the year, chose an opportune moment for its arrival.

it was shortly after dinner. in the early morning per hansa, hans olsa, and henry solum had gone east to the sioux river after wood; tönseten was so sorely troubled by rheumatism that he hadn't been able to go along; anyway, he had wood enough on hand to last until after christmas, and hauling would be easier on the snow. he did want some trees for planting; but as it was getting so late in the fall, with little likelihood of their taking root, he had given up the project.

beret sat by the window at home; she was knitting some sort of a round affair--something s

ered in front of tönseten's house, gazing with absorbed curiosity at the approaching train; it had drawn so close now that each wagon could be clearly distinguished; store-hans was riding abreast of the foremost team.

tönseten fussed about excitedly, constantly thrusting his hands in and out of the waistband of his trousers; he was here, there, and everywhere, muttering incoherently all the while. . . . good lord! he thought, were these more irish--as tough a gang as their last visitors? and hans olsa far away at the sioux river! . . . here was a fine mess, indeed!

then store-hans came galloping in, and told a story so strange that all were lost in amazement.

"they are norskies!" he shouted as he pulled up.

"what's that you say?" exclaimed tönseten.

"yes, norskies, every single one, i tell you! a whole shoal of them--and they are coming right here! they talk norwegian, too."

"are you crazy!" shouted tönseten. . . . at once he began to assume a great dignity and authority; he ordered k

e would give it a try! and so he went over to tönseten's and brought the wagon; he padded it thickly, bottom and sides, with soft hay; then he loaded it with potatoes in bulk. on top of the load he placed two sacks of rutabagas, and one of carrots; finally he picked out some of the nicest melons that were left in the cellar; these he tucked in between the sacks, covering everything with hay, and spreading some old clothes over the load.

early the next morning they started off; henry solum and hans olsa went with him.

the wagons drifted slowly through the outspread day, creeping on through indolent, drowsy fall sunshine and blue-green haze, toward a distant sky line from which hung a quivering yellow veil. for all they drove, the sky line came no closer; but when the purple shadows of evening fell, there seemed to be a chance, at least, that they might reach it.

this was a great day for per hansa. now he was travelling the very trail he should have followed on his way out last summ

uts ought to be lying! . . . wasn't there such a place out there somewhere? but it seemed strangely vague and distant now! . . . per hansa braced up in his seat, put his mind intently on beret and store-hans--and then the sod huts stood out more vividly. . . .

. . . poor beret-girl! if only she wouldn't be too lonesome while he was away!

this day's journey also turned out to be full of interesting things. as they went along, sod huts stood here and there moping dejectedly, where, according to hans olsa and the solum boy, no house should have been. . . . good heavens! where had they all come from? settlers must be swarming out of the ground like ants in summertime! . . . well, no--not so terribly many; it was only this, that there shouldn't have been any at all! . . . too bad! why hadn't these folks crossed a few more sky lines to the westward before they settled down for good!

late in the forenoon they came upon two sod houses which must have sprung up since they were last here; neither hans

, breaking prairie; here, too, the sod must be tough of fibre, for the job didn't seem to be going very fast. what first arrested the eyes of the travellers was the team that pulled the plow; an ox with shining brass sockets on the ends of his huge horns had been yoked together with a skinny poll-cow. the woman walked alongside the team, driving; the man, whose patriarchal beard swept his chest, steered the plow, pushing from behind with all his might.

these folks were hallings;1 per hansa and hans olsa were very glad to hear it. a halling is usually easy of approach; they at once struck up a conversation with these people. . . . only another incredible fairy tale! with nothing but this team, the man related, he had brought his family and all his earthly possessions the whole distance from iowa, a matter of over four-hundred miles--"a long, laborious journey," as he quaintly expressed it.

omething more coming! . . .

--huh!--said the other, his face hardening again.--he could keep his wife and youngsters; but the cow he would have to forfeit eventually, if he couldn't raise other means. . . . business was business!

the matter was finally arranged, however, in the way that per hansa wanted it; the balance of the amount should stand until next fall, at fifteen per cent interest.

then per hansa started to trade. the first thing he called for was net twine! . . . the solum boy and hans olsa burst out laughing; was he planning to knit a net out here on the open prairie? . . . never mind; he needed twine--twine first and foremost! when he finally had found a kind that he thought might do, he bought several balls; and then he called for rope--he had to have rope for the sheeting--how could he get along without that? . . . it seemed to his companions that he was wasting good money; it was a long way to the sioux river and few trips could be made during the year! this they pointed out

hen cloth, and tobacco, and matches, and kerosene; after that coffee, and molasses, and salt. this item of salt again threw his companions into consternation; per hansa ordered such an unreasonable quantity of it, and still he wondered if it wouldn't be too little! . . . lord! there was no limit to all the things per hansa thought he must have; but his money soon ran out and that put an end to the trading.

at last they were ready to leave.

"aren't we going to have a single drop on this trip?" hans olsa mused aloud.

"there you said something!" exclaimed per hansa. "that reminds me--i was to get three bottles for syvert! but not a word about it to kjersti--bear that in mind when we get home. . . . he's going to use it as liniment for his rheumatism, you know!"

the trader treated them all around before he filled the bottles. henry got two bottles for himself, and one for his brother; hans olsa had brought along his sunday bottle to be filled; as that would hardly be enough he bought a smaller

one, which he put in his pocket; per hansa got two for himself, and three for tönseten. . . . when the trader had filled all their orders he felt that he had had such good business with these fellows that he could well afford to stand another round of treats--they seemed to be such decent folk, too! and before they left they felt obliged to follow the good old custom of sampling one another's bottles. good lord! it wasn't every day that they came to town. . . . hans olsa was stepping very cautiously when he climbed into his wagon; he planked himself down upon the seat with slow and ponderous movements; but once down, there his big bulk sat secure.

it was late in the afternoon when they finally set out for home. ninety long miles lay ahead of them, but no one thought of that; they had plenty of food, the vaulted heavens for a roof wherever they chose to camp, and fair weather to send them on. . . .

per hansa drove in the van; he was continually clucking to his

 horses. his eyes were fixed on the western sky, already tinted by the strong glow of evening. . . . god! how beautiful these prairies were! . . . why couldn't they keep on driving all night long? . . .

when they at last pitched camp at the end of the day, and hans olsa had made the fire and hung the porridge pot over it, per hansa sat down by the firelight and began to whittle some shuttles for net knitting; he made two shuttles, and then a reel.

his companions laughed at him and told him he must be crazy; first he had thrown away good money on a lot of twine, and now he was wasting his time over such nonsense!

. . . "never mind," said per hansa with his merry laugh. "one only talks according to his sense!" . . . he kept on working till he had finished the

but at last winter shut down in earnest; the swamps froze up and duck hunting came to an end for that year.

"i think we ought to carry some soup meat to our neighbours," said per hansa. . . . "this time it'll be something better than badger stew!" . . .

every person in the little settlement had been rushed with work during the last days before father winter came. they all had a feeling that he wasn't very far away, that old fellow, and thought it best to be well prepared to receive him. hans olsa, tönseten, and the solum boys had been east to the sioux river again for wood; they had made two trips, and home had seen very little of them lately. few visits had been made; everyone had been busy with his own affairs. . . . for other reasons than this, visitors came but seldom to per hansa's now; there was something queer about the woman in that place; she said so little; at times people felt that they were unwelcome there. she was apt to break out suddenly with some remark that they could

at; they hardly knew whether to be surprised or offended.

but on the day when the boys carried a gift of ducks to all the houses in the neighbourhood, proud of the dainty food they brought, and relating what sounded like a fairy tale, everyone went over to per hansa's to learn how he had gone about catching these birds. for ole and store-hans wouldn't tell, though they plied them with questions. . . . the solum boys came first, with tönseten and kjersti hard upon their heels; last of all came hans olsa and sörine.

once inside, they completely forgot their curiosity about the duck hunting; they stood with their mouths open, looking up one wall and down the next.

. . . why . . . why . . . what in the wide world was this? had they plastered snow on the walls? sam thought it really was snow, and touched it gingerly with his finger. . . . what was it, anyway? could it possibly be paint? . . . my stars, how fine it looked! . . . per hansa sat there, sucking his pipe and enjoying his little trium

m? . . . "and i don't exactly see what this new notion of per hansa's is really good for," he spluttered on. "it's getting to be so damned swell in here that pretty soon a fellow can't even spit!" . . . tönseten looked accusingly at beret; it was from her that per hansa got these stuck-up airs. she was never willing to be like plain folks, that woman! . . . the solum boys took great delight in the white walls; this was really beautiful. when they got married they would do the very same thing!

hans olsa sucked his pipe and said but little. this seemed very queer to him; he turned it over and over in his mind, but couldn't solve the problem. was this like per hansa, who had always confided everything to him? . . . but here he was going about doing everything alone! when he had learned how a black earthen wall could be made shining white at so small a cost, why hadn't he told the others? there was so little cheer out here; they all sorely needed to share whatever they found. . . . the big, rugge

d features were very sober; he had to look hard at per hansa. no, it was the same good-natured face that one liked so well to have near by! this affair was just one of his many pranks; the longer hans olsa gazed at his neighbour, the more plausible grew this solution inside that big head of his.

awhile later, as the two men stood together outside the door, watching the falling snow, he said, quietly:

"you have made it pretty fine inside, per hansa; but he who is now whitening the outside of your walls does fully as well. . . . you shouldn't be vain in your own strength, you know!"

"oh, nonsense, hans olsa!" laughed per hansa. "what are you prating about? . . . here, take along a couple more du

t around and play the gentleman. times would be strenuous enough for him once more, when spring came with fair weather and his great estate needed to be planted; he would just lay off and rest for a while yet! . . .

the days only grew longer and longer.

in the end, this enforced idleness began to gall him. the landscape showed a monotonous sameness . . . never the slightest change. . . . grey sky--damp, icy cold. . . . snow fell . . . snow flew. . . . he could only guess now where the huts of hans olsa lay. there wasn't a thing to do outdoors; plenty of wood lay chopped and ready for use; it took but a little while to do the chores. . . . beyond this, everything took care of itself outside.

per hansa sat by the table, or lay down on the bed when he got tired of sitting up; tried to sleep as long as possible; woke up with a start; turned over and tried to sleep again; rose and sat by the table once more, when he grew weary of lying down.

the days wore on, and yet got nowhere. . . . time had

lared at the wall and said, angrily:

"i should think you'd be able to find something american to talk about! . . . we're through now with all that troll business over in norway!" . . . he got up and started to go. . . .

but per hansa wouldn't listen to their leaving just yet; since they had braved the weather to make a call they might as well sit awhile longer. . . . "you'll have the wind astern, syvert, going home! . . . come on, sit down and behave yourself!"

 

on another afternoon all of hans olsa's household came over. they stayed till dark; then they began to say that perhaps they'd better be going now--but they made no move to leave. . . . sörine had brought a gift for beret. there had been a few bits of cloth lying around the house, for which she could find no use; it had been rather lonesome these days and she had needed something to do, so she had made a little article for this newcomer whom everyone was waiting for! . . . at that, sörine drew out from her ample bosom a child's c

outside nearly all of the day. before evening had come, however, he had made a pair of skis for each of the boys: they were rather heavy and clumsy affairs, but would serve the purpose; the boys stood looking at them wide-eyed and happy--but still they hardly dared to come near their father. . . . when he finally entered the house that evening the supper stood ready on the table. . . . beret had gone to bed.

as soon as he had eaten he told the boys that he would have to go on an errand over to hans olsa's; he wasn't sure when he would be back; if he stayed late, they must go to bed. . . . no, they couldn't go with him! . . . he gave a glance toward the bed as he went out. . . .

when he reached hans olsa's house he asked at once if he might speak to sörine alone; he seemed bashful and embarrassed--tried to assume a bantering air, but didn't quite succeed. when sörine had stepped outside with him he asked beseechingly if she would be kind enough to go over and look after beret--the sooner the

ight away?

--was there such an awful hurry?--sörine still suspected per hansa's denial. if that was the case, he had better go and get kjersti at once; she didn't care to tackle this job alone!

--no, no--it wasn't that!

sörine went in for a moment to put on her coat; soon she came out again, ready to start. he went with her for some distance. . . .

--wasn't he coming along?--she asked, stopping to look inquiringly at him.

--no, he guessed he wouldn't; he needed to have a little talk with hans olsa to-night. he only wanted to say this: that she who understood all such things so capably, must look well to beret now; she mustn't come away and leave her too soon!

sörine's kind, intelligent face looked straight into his.

"i can see that you're worried about your wife to-night, per hansa. . . . that's fine of you, i say!"

"god richly bless you for those words, sörrina!"

per hansa suddenly felt like a new person; and yet he lacked the courage to look up.

"but let me tell you one thing, s

. . . hurry along!"

"you ought to have a whaling for that, per hansa!" she said with a laugh, but immediately grew serious. . . . "alas! life lays a hard hand on all of us! . . . well, now i'm off. you don't need to hurry to-night--if we need you, i'll send ola."

per hansa stood there in the darkness of the winter night, looking after the disappearing figure. . . . no, her equal was not to be found! she could be both minister and father confessor, that woman!

he had barely entered hans olsa's house, found a seat, and lighted his pipe, when another visitor arrived. tonseten came in, apparently in a bad humour; no, he didn't want to sit down; he was going farther on in a minute or two. did they know that the solum boys were about to leave?

"i guess we know as much as you do," said per hansa, dryly. . . . "there's such a lot going on around here these days!"

"but this won't do, folks, i tell you--it simply won't do! as kjersti says, soon we'll have nothing but the snow left!"

"and

 i hope that'll go in time, too," laughed per hansa.

"it probably will!" tönseten snapped, irritably. "but what i don't understand is, why have you folks let things come to such a pass?"

"we . . . ?" per hansa asked.

"yes, you! . . . the two of you!"

"we can't very well tie up the boys, when they are bent on going," said hans olsa.

"i didn't say we could!" . . . tönseten stood in front of him, waving his arms excitedly. "but we can use common sense, can't we?"

"very well, syvert, let's hear your common sense," spoke up per hansa.

"you talk like a fool, per hansa! here you both sit around and twiddle your thumbs, doing nothing; but you've got cubs, and will soon have more! why don't you join forces and hire henry solum to teach school for your brats this winter? there's a good enough head on henry's shoulders, let me

the other two listened in silence. the eyes of per hansa began to shoot rapid, sparkling glances, which always betrayed the fact that he was in good humour; but it was some time before he opened his mouth. hans olsa sat pondering over the new idea that had just been proposed; it was perfectly true that the children needed schooling; but how did this bear on the case, when the solum boys were ready and determined to go?

"i see you're still hesitating!" tönseten exclaimed, snappishly. "listen here, now: we're all going straight over to the solum boys and talk them into it right away!"

"it strikes me this way," said hans olsa, slowly. "if they have made up their minds, it isn't right for us to interfere."

"made up their minds!" snorted tönseten, contemptuously. "what nonsense you're talking, hans olsa! how many times have you made up your mind, i'd like to know, and then unmade it again? . . . i can assure you of one thing, fellows: if we let sam and henry slip away from us now, it's certainly doubtful if we ever see them again--single and unhitched as they are! that's just kjersti's opinion, too. then won't we be left in a fine mess, i ask you--for what chance would we stand of ever getting such good neighbours again?"

"we might try it," hans olsa conceded. "what do you think, per hansa?"

 
 ___________________________
 
over there; but--oh, well! who cares!" he grabbed up his cap impulsively. . . . "i might as well give henry a chance to tell me what he thinks of me! . . . the sooner, the better!"

they held a lengthy conference with the solum boys that night. outside of their hut the sleigh waited in readiness; inside the door the chest stood packed; the boys were on the point of going to bed when the three men entered, and were evidently annoyed to see them. . . . the newcomers seemed unaccountably bashful.

hans olsa announced their errand.

at this henry burst out laughing. . . . no, a schoolteacher he could never be, he said; he had other things to think of; back east in minnesota somewhere, a girl was straying about looking for him; if he could only find her, he too would be needing a teacher by and by! . . .

then tönseten began to talk; there was a note in his voice that put all joking aside, even though they had to laugh at him now and then:

"if you leave this place, you'll have to take kjersti and

me along with you, though i don't know what we would do with ourselves back in minnesota! she and i crossed the red sea, as it were, when we left last spring. . . . for her and me there is no road leading back! . . . what do you think we're going to do, i'd like to know, when you are gone? at hans olsa's they don't play cards; and per hansa, poor devil--well, he has a sick woman on his hands. . . . god alone knows how that business is going to come off. that's just what kjersti says, too!"

per hansa had been silent ever since he came in; now he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, rose from the chest, and turned to henry:

"i'll tell you exactly how we stand--and this is gospel truth. if you and sam leave us now, it'll be so dull and dreary for the rest of us that we might as well hang ourselv

er and laid his head in her lap--the tousled head that only she could lull to sleep--then she felt that now she was crossing the very threshold of paradise! . . . though she had had a thousand lives, she would have thrown them all away for one such moment--and would have been glad of the bargain! . . .

. . . yes, she remembered all that had happened in those days; it was so still out here . . . so easy to remember!

no one had ever told her, but she knew full well who it was that had persuaded hans olsa to leave the land and the ancient farm that had been in his family for generations, and go to america. there had been only one other person in the world whom per hansa loved, and that was hans olsa. she had been jealous of hans olsa because of this; it had seemed to her that he took something that rightfully belonged to her. she had even felt the same way toward sörine, who was kindness itself; on this account she had not been able to hold her friendship as fully as she needed to, either in no

won him. was it not worth all the care and sorrow in the world to taste such bliss, she had often asked herself--but had been unable to answer. but--then it had happened: this spring she had been gotten with child again. . . . let no one tell her that this was not destiny!

she had urged against this last journey; she had argued that they must tarry where they were until she had borne the child. one year more or less would make no difference, considering all the land there was in the west . . . hans olsa, however, had been ready to start; and so there had been no use in trying to hold back per hansa. all her misgiving he had turned to sport and laughter, or playful love; he had embraced her, danced around with her, and become so roguish that she had been forced to laugh with him. . . . "come here, litagod--now we're gone!" . . . she well recalled how lovely this endearing term had sounded in her ears, the first night he had used it. . . .

but this was clear to her beyond a doubt: per hansa was

h neighbour women were now taking turns at staying with her, each one a day at a time. they saw clearly that per hansa was more in need of help than beret; there was no helping her now, while something, at least, could be done for him and the children. christmas would soon be here, too, and the house ought to be made comfortable and cosy!

they all felt very sorry for per hansa. he walked about like a ragged stray dog; his eyes burned with a hunted look. each day, the children were sent over to hans olsa's to stay for a while; if they remained longer than they had been told, he made no protest; at last they formed the habit of staying the whole day. he did not realize that it was bad for beret to be without them so much; he tried to keep the talk going himself, but she had little to say; she answered in monosyllables and had grown peculiarly quiet and distant. in the shadow of a faint smile which she occasionally gave him there lay a melancholy deeper than the dusk of the arctic sea on a rainy,

about noon of christmas eve the air suddenly cleared. an invisible fan was pushed in under the thick, heavy curtain that hung trembling between earth and heaven--made a giant sweep, and revealed the open, blue sky overhead. the sun shone down with powerful beams, and started a slight trickling from the eaves. toward evening, it built a golden fairy castle for itself out yonder, just beyond indian hill.

the children were at hans olsa's; and-ongen wanted to stay outside and watch the sunset. sofie had told her that to-day was christmas eve, and that on every christmas jesus came down from heaven. the child asked many questions. . . . would he come driving? couldn't they lend him the pony? . . . sofie hardly thought so--he probably would be driving an angel-pony!

store-hans, who was listening to them, thought this very silly and just like girls. he knew better! . . . toward evening he suddenly wanted to go home, and was almo

ret gave a long shriek that rent the night. then she sobbed violently, praying that they should not take her away from per hansa. . . .

per hansa leaped to his feet, and found his voice.

"satan--now you shall leave her alone!" he shouted, flinging the door open and calling loudly to the women outside. then he vanished into the darkness.

no one thought of seeking rest that night. all the evening, lights shone from the four huts; later they were extinguished in two of them; but in the house of hans olsa four men sat on, grieving over the way things were going at per hansa's. when they could bear the suspense no longer some one proposed going over to get news.

tönseten offered to go first. . . . when he came back little sense could be gathered from what he said. he had not been allowed inside; the women were in a frenzy; the house was completely upset; beret was wailing so loud that it was dreadful to hear. and per hansa himself was nowhere to be found. . . . "we must go and look for him, boy

s! . . . haven't you got a bible or something to read from, hans olsa? this is an awful thing!"

. . . there they sat, each occupied with his own thoughts--but all their thoughts were of the same trend. if beret died to-night, it would go hard with per hansa--indeed it would. in that case he probably wouldn't stay out here very long. . . . but if he went away, the rest of them might as well pack up and go, too!

sam ran over to inquire; then henry; at last it was hans olsa's turn. he managed to get a couple of words with his wife, who said that beret would hardly stand it. no one had seen per hansa.

"can you imagine where the man can be keeping himself?" asked tönseten, giving voice to the fear that oppressed them all. . . . "may the lord preserve his wits, even if he chooses to take his wife away!" . . .

per hansa walked to and fro outside the hut all night long; when he heard some one coming he would run away into the darkness. he could not speak to a living

ed; clouds of frosty mist like huge writhing serpents curled over the surface of the purplish-yellow plain. the sunbeams plunging into them kindled a weird light. he tingled with the cold; his eyelashes froze together so that he had to rub them with his mittens to keep them free.

. . . how remarkable--the child had been born with the helmet on! . . . he quickened his pace; in a moment he was running. . . .

"peace be upon this house, and a merry christmas, folks!" he greeted them as he entered hans olsa's door. . . . the room was cold; the solum boys lay in one bed, fully dressed; both were so sound asleep that they did not wake up at his coming. his own children and sofie lay in the other bed, ole by himself down at the foot, the other three on the pillow; store-hans held and-ongen close, as if trying to protect her. hans olsa and tönseten had moved their chairs up to the stove, and sat hunched over on either side; tönseten was nodding, the other was wide awake; both men jumped up when per

hansa came in, and stood staring at him.

per hansa had to laugh outright at them; they were looking at him as if they had seen a ghost. but to the two men his laugh sounded pleasanter than anything they had heard in many a year.

"how are things coming?" asked tönseten, excitedly, working his shoulders.

"oh, it might have been worse!"

hans olsa grasped his hand: "will she pull through?"

"it looks that way."

then tönseten suddenly seemed to realize that it was cold in the room; he began to walk around, beating goose with his arms. . . . "i'm ready to bet both my horses that it's a boy! i can see it in your face!" he exclaimed, still beating.

"all signs point that way, syvert! but he's in pretty poor condition, sörrina tells me. . . . now look here, hans olsa: it's up to you to come over and christen the boy for me!"

"nothing of the kind, hans olsa. . . . you just get yourself ready. . . . it's all written down in the hymn book--what to say, and how to go about it."

"no, no--i couldn't think of such a thing!" protested hans olsa, all of a tremble with the feeling of awe that had suddenly taken possession of him. . . . "a sinner like me!" . . .

then per hansa made a remark that tönseten thought was extremely well put:

"how you stand with the lord i don't know. but this i do know: that a better man either on land or sea, he will have to look a long way to find. . . . and it seems to me that he has got to take that, too, into his reckoning!"

but hans olsa only stood there in terror. . . . "you'd better ask syvert to d

then tönseten grew alarmed:

"don't stand there talking like a fool! . . . we all know that if one of us two is to tackle this job, it must be you, hans olsa. . . . there is nothing for you to do but go at once; this business won't stand any dillydallying, let me tell you!"

hans olsa gazed straight ahead; his helplessness grew so great that he was funny to look at; but no one thought of laughing, just the same. . . . "if it only won't be blasphemy!" . . . he finally straggled into his big coat and put on his mittens. then he turned to tönseten. . . . "the book says: 'in an extreme emergency a layman may perform this act'--isn't that so?"

"yes, yes--just so! . . . whatever else you'll need, is written there too!"

through the frosty morning the two men walked silently acro

he boy must have a second name--so you'd better christen him peder seier!1 . . . the last is after your sörrina. . . . she has done me a greater service this night than i can ever repay! and now the boy is to be named after her!"

 

1 the name seier, which means victorious, was altogether unusual to norwegian ears. the english equivalent will be used from now on. as this name plays such an important part in the psychology of book ii the reader would do well to remember the norwegian form.

 

hans olsa could think of nothing to say in answer to all this. they walked on in silence. . . .

when they came into the room, they stepped across the threshold reverently. an air of sabbath had descended on the room. the sun shone brightly through the window, spreading a golden lustre over the white walls; only along the north wall, where the bed stood, a half shadow lingered. . . . the fire crackled in the stove; the coffeepot was boiling. the table had been spread with a white cover; upon it lay the o

the next moment they had all gathered around the table.

"here's the book. . . . just read it out as well as you can, and we'll do whatever the book says," sörine encouraged her husband. she seemed to have taken charge of the ceremony, and spoke in low, reassuring tones, as if she had done nothing else all her life but attend to such duties; and it was her confidence that gave hans olsa the courage he needed. . . . he went up to the table, took the book, and read the ritual in a trembling voice, slowly, with many pauses. and so he christened the child peder victorious, pronouncing the name clearly. whereupon he said the lord's prayer so beautifully, that kjersti exclaimed she had never heard the like.

"there, now!" said kjersti with great emphasis. "i don't believe there is a thing lacking to make this christening perfectly correct! . . . now the coffee is ready and we're all

but per hansa was searching over in the corner; at last he produced a bottle. first he treated sörine; then kjersti. . . . "if ever two people have earned something good, you two are it! . . . come on, now, have another little drop! . . . and hurry up about it, please! hans olsa and i feel pretty weak in the knees ourselves!"

. . . after a while both food and drink were served. . . . "it looks as if we were going to have a real christmas, after all!" said per hansa with a laugh, as they sat around the table enjoying their coffee.

 hurt her deeply to know it; she had so much wanted to lie in the old chest that she loved.

at last she sank into a doze, hovering gently on the borderline between sleep and waking. . . . for an instant she dropped off into unconsciousness; then she awoke with a start and felt that things were growing clearer. everything in the house seemed to be in order. but she felt a vague, troubled curiosity to know where per hansa was, with and-ongen and the boys. . . . probably they had all gone over to hans olsa's? . . . slowly the fragments of thought were finding one another in her mind, meeting and coming together, and taking on natural shape and form. a sense of well-being swept over her, so strong and healthy that it gradually calmed her senses and carried her off into a sound sleep.

she was awakened awhile later by dreaming that she had been borne upward in the midst of something soft and warm . . . in an infinitely large room. . . . "this cannot go on any longer," she thought. "if i rise any fa

er or a general. . . . it must have been the latter alternative that gave tönseten his big idea. he had been sitting there craftily pondering how he might outdo the whole of them. now he arose, knocked the ashes from his pipe, cleared his throat mightily, and said, as if the thing were foreordained and altogether beyond dispute:

"the boy will, of coarse, be president! he is born in the country--everything points in that direction."

this ridiculous fancy threw them into gales of laughter. but hans olsa did not join in the merriment; he remained grave and sat gazing thoughtfully at the wall. now he stretched, and said, as soon as he could be heard:

"i think we'll be more in need of a good governor out here, syvert; these prairies will be a state some day."

and there the discussion ended. all felt that at last hans olsa had proposed something that bore the stamp of good sense.

neither beret nor per hansa had taken part in this discussion. they sat listening to it, full of secret elation. . .

no one knows what might have happened to them that winter if they had not had their school to fall back on. . . . but there it was--a great school, too, a refuge for them all.

at first it was held in the house of the solum boys, and the plan worked out very well. but then it occurred to sörine that they ought to find a more practical arrangement. henry might just as well conduct his school in her house; in which case both she and hans olsa could benefit by the instruction. and sam could come over, too. both the solum boys were pleased with the new plan.

a little later, when beret was quite well again, per hansa came one day to inquire if it mightn't be possible to move the school to his house every other week--for beret's sake. it would be interesting for her to listen to the instruction; and, besides, both of them needed to learn english. why couldn't henry teach his school just as well over there? . . . they all agreed that th

ss, he resorted to the means that lay nearest at hand--story-telling. hunting through his memory, he sought out all the tales that he had heard or read; and these he related in either norwegian or english, making the children repeat them until they had been memorized. in this way they learned both the story and the language--such as it was. then he proposed to set them the task of writing words and sentences. a fine plan, if they only had something to write on and something to write with. . . . hans olsa made a large wooden slate for his girl, and gave her the last remaining stub of a carpenter's pencil which he had brought from norway. . . . and now that sofie had a slate, per hansa's boys must have something to write on, too. their father took the two thickest pieces of log that he had standing behind the stove, and whittled each into an object intended to be a writing board; but ole called his an ox yoke, because it was so heavy to carry around. for pencils they used nails and bits of charco

the winter's supply of wood which the settlers had brought home was disappearing very fast--it had vanished like snow in a warm spring thaw. now it was almost gone.

hans olsa had discovered a new kind of fuel that grew more and more valuable to them as their wood supply ran low. one day as he was clearing the manger of coarse hay which the cow refused to eat it had struck him that this cast-off hay might possibly be put to a practical use. hans olsa was a frugal man, who tried to utilize everything that came to his hand. why wouldn't this hay make good kindling? . . . in order to avoid littering up the floor of the house, he twisted the hay into fagots before he car

 fact confronted them that the men would have to go east to the sioux river for a further supply of wood. the journey demanded great preparations and left little time for going to school. but it was decided that in spite of everything, henry must keep on with his teaching. since they couldn't leave the women alone under any circumstances, the school served as a good excuse for keeping him at home. he would have to be the guardian of the whole settlement while they were gone.

both tönseten and hans olsa thought it impossible for per hansa to make such a journey with oxen at this time of the year; they advised him to join forces with them. then they could all work together, and divide equally whatever they brought home. this sounded like good counsel, and per hansa made no objection to it at the time. but for a day or two he went about his work pondering deeply. before christmas he had made a sleigh, such as it was. one night he asked the boys to help him after school, and, taking the oxen out,

 of spring. it seemed to be the very weather they had been waiting for. . . . the men gathered together in a little knot to talk it over, wondering if it would be safe to chance it to-day. . . . well, yes, it looked all right now, speculated tönseten, peering into the sky and turning his quid in his cheek; but this sort of weather wasn't exactly dependable. somehow, it didn't seem natural for this time of year. . . . "it has too sweet a face, i think!"

they had better make a start, counselled hans olsa. already it was late in february; the spring thaw would soon be setting in.

"well," said per hansa, "if we have any idea of bringing a few sticks of wood home before the haying season begins, we'd better get a move on. . . . all the same, i agree with you, syvert. . . . it looks to me like a weather-breeder. but we ought to be able to reach the trönders' before anything happens."

then they began to get ready. there were numberless things to attend to, so that it was past ten o'clock before t

hey set out. they had not burdened themselves with provisions, knowing that they would soon come to hospitable folk; but to be on the safe side they all carried a small supply of food in their pockets.

the four teams formed quite a caravan, each with its own sleigh, trailing in single file across the white plain. hans olsa, who had the fastest horses, drove in the van; then came tönseten; then sam; while per hansa's oxen, shambling along with him and his sleigh, drew up the rear.

the whole settlement was out-of-doors to see the caravan set forth. the children were dismissed from school for a little while; the grown folks left their work. . . . store-hans clenched his fists in impotent fury. . . . what foolishness! . . . what an idiotic arrangement! here they had to sit indoors, he and his brother, in such fine

e his head the heavens were still clear; but under the rim of the onrushing cloud a bluish-black shadow had settled on the prairie.

the south wind suddenly died in fitful gasps, leaving a chill in the air. . . . a weird silence had fallen. . . . the thing in the west was possessed of baleful life. it shot outward and upward. . . . sighs as if out of a cold cavern ran before it. . . . in a twinkling, the day had been swallowed in gloom. . . .

those in the lead had stopped at the first warning. hans olsa had waited until tönseten and sam came up; when per hansa reached them, the three sleighs were all huddled together.

"it's going to strike us in a minute," said hans olsa, soberly. he was standing beside his sleigh, clearing the lashing-rope.

"looks like it," answered per hansa, dryly. "if we ever get out of this--!" . . . he jumped out and followed hans olsa's lead, clearing his own rope.

the solum boy said nothing, but worked frantically to get his rope untangled.

"this is what we must d

"yes, yes!" his sailor instincts were all alive. "it looks as if the storm would travel the way we're going. we'll have to watch the wind. . . . whatever you do, keep a sharp lookout for the country we know on this side of the river. if we should sail past the trönders', there'll be hell to pay. . . . hurry up, now. damn the luck, that we haven't got a compass!" the words tu

each man tied his lashing-rope to the sleigh, and gave the other end to the next one behind. per hansa ran forward to the solum boy:

"all ready, sam? are you sure your rope is fast? i don't believe i'll be able to keep up with you. . . . but listen: don't give a thought to what lies behind you! do you hear? hold on like hell to syvert's rope! it's a matter of life and death. do you understand? . . . now we must get a move on!"

both per hansa and hans olsa--old lofotmen that they were--had seen plenty of storms that made up fast; but nothing like this had ever before come within the range of their experience. like lightning a giant troll had risen up in the west, ripped open his great sack of woolly fleece, and emptied the whole contents of it above their heads.

 his five senses came back to him; and sure enough, there they all were, his good neighbours. he knew the room well, too, and the folk who owned it. . . . he could see sam plainly enough now--sam, who could sing so well, sitting close to the stove, beside a fair young girl. . . . he couldn't make out whether he was closer to the girl or to the stove. per hansa smiled to himself. . . . ah, sam, sam! . . . no doubt about your being a good man some day! . . .

he listened in deep contentment while hans olsa related how they had driven like demons, to save their lives. they had had no idea where they were going nor what lay ahead of them; but at the last moment, when they had almost given up hope, they had gotten their bearings of the country on this side of the river and had arrived at this very spot. that had been two hours ago; it was now past nine o'clock. . . .

"shut your mouth, per hansa! what are you standing there moping about?" tönseten's face was fiery red; the dance whirled him away before he had time to say anything more.

per hansa began to breathe hard and fast; his eyes snapped with excitement, narrowing to little slits. right in the midst of a flock of dancers a big head bobbed up and down, up and down, above all the others, like a buoy on a high sea. . . . then per hansa completely forgot himself. "by all the frolicking seraphims, there's hans olsa dancing the schottische!" . . . waves of spasmodic twitching passed over him, in time to the jigging tune; his eyes blinked rapidly. . . . he looked around for the baarstads, saw them close at hand, and grasped gurina's arm.

"come, show me how the trönders dance that tune!"

forgotten was everything else now. with his arm around gurina, he manœuvred toward the centre of the floor until he had reached his neighbour's side. . . . "get out of the way, hans olsa! i want plenty of room to swing i

"i don't believe per hansa is ready himself to swallow that story," thought hans olsa, but he raised no objection. . . . "god save them from making mistakes in their figuring!" ran through kjersti's mind, as she listened in awe to per hansa and syvert rolling up the total; but she was careful to throw no cold water on the dream.

. . . on a day like this it was impossible to believe in such fine fancies; they all felt it, deep down in their hearts.

"names?"

"yes, names! . . . that point would have to be settled clearly beforehand," tönseten explained. "when the deeds were taken out, their names would then be written into the law of the land, and thereafter would be as unchangeable as the constitution itself!"

. . . but they all had been baptized! how about tönseten himself? asked per hansa, irritably. he couldn't understand why the name peder hansen wou

omes hansdatter (hans' daughter), which she retains even after marriage. when the norwegians became independent landowners in america their slumbering sense of the historical fitness of things awoke, and so many of them adopted the name of the place they had come from in the old country. hence the many american names now ending in --dahl, --fjeld, --gaard, --stad, etc. as the swedes, and the danes, too, had so many hansens and olsens and johnsons, the change was really a very practical one.

 

hans olsa laughed good-naturedly, and said with quiet humour: "then perhaps i had better call myself olav trygvason. . . . wasn't there some one of that name?"

this made everyone laugh: hans olsa's shaft had suddenly torn a rift in their mood of depression.

"well, well," chuckled per hansa, "if you want to be olav trygvason, i'll be peter tordenskjold! but then we'll have to rechristen syvert, too . . . st. olaf or tore hund.2 how would that do, hans olsa? . . . if that wouldn't proclaim to both jew an

er directly she stopped singing and answered that it made little difference to her, if--she choked, and went on--if it was right for a person to take a name other than the one given in baptism. . . . but it made no difference to her. sörine grew serious over this point. "i agree with you, beret. . . . but here in this country we can't bear our fathers' names, anyway. it wouldn't do for me to sign my name as sörine sakkarias'-daughter!"

"no," cried tönseten, excitedly, "not if you want to be hans olsa's wife!" . . . remarkable what a bright head sat on sörrina's shoulders!

this matter of names brought on a long discussion. hans olsa, like the others, decided that his wife had made a practical suggestion; per hansa found little to say, but his face had a look of quiet elation. . . . he must speak to beret about this, alone and right away! . . . he sat there trying the name over in his mind, first on her, then on himself, finally on each of the children. as he ran them over, the radiant ligh

he got up suddenly, grasped the waistband of his trousers, and gave them a hitch.

. . . "sörrina has got it right--that name is both pretty and practical. what do you say, boys--shall we adopt the plan?"

per hansa was plainly in a towering humour now; the note of it rang in his voice. there was no opposing him. . . . after that day, each of the two families in question had a pair of surnames. among themselves they always used the old names, but among strangers they were vaag and holm--though hans olsa invariably wrote it with a "w" instead of a "v."

 

that night beret sat quietly by herself. the chores were long since done and they had eaten their supper. the children were in bed. they had been very noisy tonight, in their excitement over the new name that sörine had invented for them. but now they were all asleep. per hansa was getting ready to go to bed; he moved about abstractedly and took a long time over everything he did. he, too, was full of excitement, thinking about the name. . .

 dollars on the table for beret; besides this, he had brought things for the house on each trip--things that he knew she went about wishing for.

he had returned from the last journey with two frozen toes. these were giving him a good deal of trouble when he and the other men were forced to make the trip to the trönders' for the seed. . . . it was necessary to get it home while the sleighing lasted; he was not even properly rested when they had to set off.

on that trip he went in company with hans olsa. he had a feeling that since they were going so far anyway, he ought to accomplish something besides their immediate errand. casting his eyes around at sioux river, he bought a one-year-old heifer from gurina baarstad. . . . the heifer was spotted red and white, and was therefore given the name of "spotty" as soon as he reached home with her.

in all this going and coming beret had said very little, either when he set out or when he returned. he couldn't help feeling the strangeness of it; she

rked each plot. one and one-half bushels of seed to the acre was the regular measure; but simon baarstad had told him that on really first-class breaking, provided the soil was unusually excellent, one and one-quarter bushels might do; and per hansa had decided to try the latter amount.

he filled the seed bag, hung it over his shoulder, and was ready. his whole body shook. he paused for an instant and glanced about the settlement. . . . yes, sir, he was the first, the very first one! there was hans olsa hauling manure to his garden patch. . . . that's smart of you, hans olsa! . . . down to the southward he caught sight of tönseten pottering around his yard. . . . so much for you! . . . then he turned to look in a northerly direction. . . . by god, if the solum boys hadn't already started breaking! . . . muttering, "well, well, well," he strode over to the edge of the field and stuck his hand into the bag.

into each other's eyes and instantly a bond of understanding had been established. "you come with me!" urged beret. . . . "o god! this isn't the place, either!" wailed the woman; but she followed beret submissively into the house.

"well, well!" sighed the man as he began to unhitch the horses. "life isn't easy--no, it certainly isn't." . . .

per hansa watched him anxiously, hardly knowing what to do. both the boys kept close to him. then an idea flashed through his mind: "you boys run over to hans olsa's and tell him not to go to bed until i come. . . . no, i don't want him here. and you two stay over there to-night. now run along!"

turning to the man, he asked, "aren't there any more in your party?"

"no, not now. we were five, you see, to begin with--five in all--but the others had to go on. . . . haven't they been by here yet? well, they must be somewhere over to the westward. . . . no, life isn't easy." . . . the man wandered on in his monotonous, blurred tone; he sounded all the time as

"john! john!" admonished the father. "aren't you ashamed of yourself--a grown-up man like you! take the milk and carry it into the house!"

"that's right!" echoed per hansa, pulling himself together. "we'd better all go in. there's shelter here, and plenty to eat."

beret was bustling around the room when they entered; she had put the woman to bed, and now was tending her. "where are the boys?" she asked.

per hansa told her that he had sent them to hans olsa's for the night.

"that was hardly necessary; we could have made room here somehow." beret's voice carried a note of keen reproach.

the man had paused at the door; now he came over to the bed, took the limp hand, and muttered: "poor soul! . . . why, i believe she's asleep already!"

beret came up and pushed him gently aside. "be careful! don't wake her. she needs the rest."

"ya, i don't doubt it--not i! she hasn't slept for a week, you see--the poor soul!" with a loud sniff, he turned and lef

 barn, after helping the strangers settle themselves for the night. beret was sitting on the edge of the bed, dressing the baby for the night; she had put and-ongen to bed beside the distracted woman.

"did she tell you much?" he asked in a low voice.

beret glanced toward the other bed before she answered:

"only that she had had to leave one of her children on the way. she wasn't able to talk connectedly."

"it's a terrible thing!" he said, looking away from his wife. "i think i'll go over to hans olsa's for a minute. i want to talk this matter over with him."

"talk it over with him?" she repeated, coldly. "i don't suppose hans olsa knows everything!"

"no, of course not. but these people have got to be helped, and we can't do it all alone." he hesitated for a minute, as if waiting for her consent. "well, i won't be gone long," he said as he went out of the door.

when he returned, an hour later, she was still sitting on the edge of the bed, with the baby asleep on her lap. they sat in silen

herself, but without undressing. . . . the lamp shed only a faint light. it was so quiet in the room that one could hear the breathing of all the others. beret lay there listening; though the room was still, it seemed alive to her with strange movements; she forced herself to open her eyes and look around. noticing that per hansa wasn't asleep, either, she asked:

"did you look after the boys?"

"nothing the matter with them! they were fast asleep in sofie's bed."

"you told them everything, at hans olsa's?"

"of course!"

"what did they think of it?"

per hansa raised himself on his elbows and glanced at the broken creature lying in the bed back of theirs. the woman, apparently, had not stirred a muscle. "it's a bad business," he said. "we must try to get together a coffin and find the boy. we can't let him lie out there--that way." . . . as beret made no answer, he briefly narrated the story that the man had told him. "the fellow is a good-for-nothing, stupid fool, i'm sure of that," conclude

she listened to him in silence. for some time she brooded over her thoughts; then in a bitter tone she suddenly burst out: "now you can see that this kind of a life is impossible! it's beyond human endurance."

he had not the power to read her thoughts; he did not want to know them; to-night every nerve in his body was taut with apprehension and dismay. but he tried to say, reassuringly: "hans olsa and i will both go with the man, as soon as the day breaks. if we only had something to make the coffin of! the few pieces of board that i've got here will hardly be enough. . . . now let's go to sleep. be sure and call me if you need anything!"

he turned over resolutely, as if determined to sleep; but she noticed that he was a long time doing it. . . . i wonder what's going through his mind? she thought. she was glad to have him awake, just the same; to-night there were strange things abroad

ntly gone out. hadn't she heard it in her sleep? beret went through the door and stood in front of the house, but did not dare to make an outcry; she listened intently, then called in a low voice; getting no answer, she ran around the house, peering hither and thither, but the grey morning light disclosed nothing.

running back into the house, she called her husband distractedly: "she's gone! get up! you must hurry!"

in an instant per hansa was up and had tumbled into his clothes. "run over to hans olsa's and tell him to come at once! be as quick as you can! in the meanwhile i'll search down by the creek."

when they came out, the first light of day was creeping up the eastern sky; a slight fog floated along the creek; the morning air was crisp and cool. per hansa leaped up into the seat of the wagon and scanned the prairie in every direction. . . . what was that, over there? wasn't it a human being standing on the top of the hill? could she have taken that direction? . . . he jumped down from

per hansa went up and spoke to her, his voice sounding hoarse and unnatural. "come with me, now! to-day hans olsa and i are going to find your boy." taking her gently by the arm, he led her back to the house. . . . it's very kind of him, to help find paul, she thought, and followed willingly.

at breakfast she sat very quiet; she ate when they bade her, but never spoke. while they were making the coffin she sat looking on, wondering why they didn't hurry faster with the work. couldn't they understand that paul was cold? a little later a handsome woman entered the house--a woman with such a kind face, who l

as soon as the coffin was ready, per hansa and hans olsa, along with the stranger and his wife, left the settlement to hunt for the body of the dead boy. they took quite a stock of provisions with them. on this search they were gone four days; they criss-crossed the prairie for a long way to the east, and searched high and low; but when they returned the coffin was still empty.

after the return from the search the strangers stayed one more day with them. the morning they were to leave it looked dark and threatening, and per hansa wouldn't

they must be hard at it. her loneliness was so great that she felt a physical need of bringing happiness to some living thing; as soon as she got home she took her little remaining store of rice and cooked porridge for supper; the boys were very fond of that dish.

toward evening the air grew heavy and sultry; the cloud banks, still rolling up in the western sky, had taken on a most threatening aspect; it looked as if a thunderstorm might be coming on.

after supper per hansa was due to meet at hans olsa's with the other neighbours, to lay plans for the trip to town which had to be made before harvesting set in. the boys asked leave to go, too--it was so much fun to be with the men.

when she had washed the supper dishes beret went outdoors and sat down on the woodpile. a nameless apprehension tugged at her heart and would not leave her in peace; taking the two children as before, she again ascended the hill. the spell of the afternoon's sadness was still upon her; her constant self-reproach si

tönseten would give an embarrassed cough: "you mean perhaps in minnesota?"

"certainly! wasn't that what i said?" whereupon both would laugh like a couple of happy boys.

but one forenoon tönseten came over in great excitement, declaring flatly that now they would have to start cutting here--and no use talking! he had just come from hans olsa's, where he'd been looking at the field; and there, too, the grain was ripening fast. this job had to be gotten out of the way right now, or where the devil would they be?

"oh, what's your hurry, syvert? don't let's get excited; we'll just give her one more night for extra measure!" argued per hansa.

then tönseten grew goggle-eyed, waving his arms as he talked. "you're a stubborn, ignorant fool, per hansa--i don't mind telling you so! no, i'm damned if i do! here we have eighty acres of grai

at that tönseten got mad in earnest. "you make me tired, man! you don't know as much as the nose on your face--no, you don't! what the devil would happen to us if all our grain came in at the same time? just what would we do, i'd like to know? we couldn't save it. . . . now i've made up my mind: there's to be no more damned shilly-shallying. we start this afternoon, and that's the end of it!"

"as you say, captain!" answered per hansa, meekly, his eyes twinkling.

"all right, then. i'll tell hans olsa. you run over and tell the solum boys."

per hansa chuckled aloud. "are you going to call in all of dakota territory to help harvest this little patch of mine?"

"stop your joking, per hansa! you don't know an earthly thing about harvesting in america--no, you don't! you and hans olsa couldn't any more take care of the binding, when i once get going, than you could fly! you don't even know what needs to be done; you've never seen a job of binding in your life! . . . now do as i tell you and get

"well, you see, he gets sort of strung-up when he's turned loose among the trönder women--not that i mean anything, you know. . . ."

"sam, you're a fool!" remarked tönseten, angrily, laying down his spoon and leaving the table.

by noon the next day they had finished the wheat field. to-day tönseten was of a different mind--there really was no great hurry; the weather kept cool, and the grain didn't look any riper to-day than yesterday, either at his own place or at hans olsa's; if this spell of cool weather should last, the wheat would profit by yet another week; but then they might prepare to harvest a crop unique in the history of wheat growing.

tönseten felt highly well pleased with himself and the rest of the world; he had now proved his prowess before his neighbours; the field was almost finished here, and it wouldn't do any harm to rest and visit awhile. . . . "don't fret, boys, i won't need to hurry at all! those four acres of oats will only be play for th

and per hansa felt very much the same way. he and the other men were sitting in the shade on the north side of the house, with their backs up against the wall, enjoying the cool breeze that had sprung up from the west. . . . what was the use of hurrying? . . . per hansa had told the solum boys that he wouldn't need them that afternoon, as he and hans olsa could easily bind the oats; but it was so pleasant to rest here and spin yarns that the boys didn't feel like stirring until the others went to the field.

as they got up at last and returned to their work, the northwest breeze struck them full in the face with its cool, fresh fragrance; tönseten sniffed it approvingly, declaring that if this weather kept on, he and hans olsa would be sure to steal a march on per hansa in the end; never had the lord sent finer weather for wheat to ripen in! he

"well, boys, in my opinion the land of canaan didn't have much on this country--no, i'm damned if it had! do you suppose the children of israel ever smelt a westerly breeze like this? why, folks, it's blowing honey!" . . . his festive mood was still possessing him as he began to hitch up the horses; in the midst of it he had to turn around and ask them shyly, "now, wasn't it remarkable that i should discover just this place for you?"

hans olsa burst into a laugh. "yes, it surely was wonderful, syvert!"

but tönseten felt that this praise wasn't enough--he wanted to carry the joke a little farther. turning to his other neighbour, he asked with the same roguish air, "what did you say, per hansa?"

per hansa remained strangely silent; he was standing a little distance away, shading his eyes with his light hand and looking into the west; an intent, troubled expression had come over his face.

. . . "what in the devil? . . ." he muttered

 to himself. off in the western sky he had caught sight of something he couldn't understand--something that sent a nameless chill through his blood. . . . could that be a storm coming on?

he hurried over to the wheat shock where hans olsa was sitting, pointed westward, and asked in a low voice, "tell me, can you see anything over there?"

hans olsa was on his feet in an instant. . . . "well, look at that! . . . it must be going to storm!"

tönseten had finished hitching the horses to the reaper, and had just mounted the seat when he saw per hansa run over, pointing to the west. now both his neighbours were shouting at him: "what's that, syvert?"

tönseten turned in his seat, to face a sight such as he had never seen or heard before. from out of the west layers of clouds came rolling--thin layers that rose and sank on the breeze; they ha

 the face of this tragedy threw him into an uncontrollable fury; he lost all restraint over himself. "you, ola!" he shouted, hoarsely. "run home after old maria, and bring the caps!"

the boy was soon back with the old musket. his father, hardly able to wait, ran to meet him and snatched the weapon out of his hands. hurriedly putting on a cap, he settled himself in a firm foothold--for he still had sense enough to remember how hard the rifle kicked when it had been lying loaded a long time.

as hans olsa caught wind of what he intended to do he tried to stop it. "don't do that, per hansa! if the lord has sent this affliction on us, then . . ."

per hansa glowered at him with a look of angry determination; then, facing squarely the hurricane of flying bodies, he fired straight into the thickest of the welter! . . . the awful detonation of the old, rusty muzzle-loader had a singular effect; at first, as the shattering sound died away, nothing appeared to have happened--the glittering demons flick

"do you suppose you've actually driven them off?" cried henry, breathlessly, marvelling as he watched.

"yes, from here!" said hans olsa in the same solemn tone, as he pointed down the hill. "but see our fields . . . !"

per hansa was still in the grip of the strange spell that had taken possession of him; he apparently did not hear what the others were saying; without looking again he hurried off to help sam with the horses. "let's get the reaper started!" he cried. "no sense in sitting here like a row of dummies!"

his example roused them once more, and without further words they followed his lead; just before sundown that nig

 over. as soon as he could get away each man hurried to his own place; they were all terribly anxious to see how much damage had been done at home. . . . couldn't they start cutting to-morrow, even if the grain wasn't quite ripe? they thought as they hurried on. wouldn't it be possible to save something out of the wreck? what in god's name could they do if the whole crop were destroyed? . . . anxiety tugged at their heartstrings. yes, what could they do? . . .

ole and store-hans went home with hans olsa to bring back word as to whether it would be possible to start harvesting his field in the morning. per hansa walked home alone; the spell had lifted now, and the reaction had left him in a troubled, irresolute frame of mind. the things that had happened that afternoon seemed harsh and inexplicable. . . . to be sure, he had saved his whole crop--but how and why? he had saved it--partly because of his own foolish, headstrong acts, and partly because his land chanced to lie so much higher than th

as soon as the meal was safely over, he found a pretext for leaving the room.

a few moments later the minister came out into the yard, with his satchel in his hand, and glanced around at the neighbourhood where he had arrived. in his wake came kjersti, bashfully tripping out of the house; tönseten walked restlessly about the yard, handling one thing after another, but did not approach the minister; then the latter called out to him:

. . . who lived directly west of them?

. . . why, that was hans olsa--that is to say, hans vaag.

. . . and to the north?

. . . that was per holm--or rather per hansa, as he was called.

the minister scrutinized closely that part of the settlement visible from where they stood; then he went on with his inquiries about the people. . . . where was the largest house? . . . did he mean the biggest room? well, that was at per holm's; he had gone ahead and built on a big scale the very spring he came out; people had thought him crazy for putting up such a sod house,

 the meeting had come. the people filed slowly in and took their places, settling down wherever space was available; on the beds sat women crowded close together, strung along the edge like beads; these were mostly the mothers, and behind them sat and lay the children all over the beds; on the big chest eight in all had taken their seats, running from big to little; the chest had been pulled out from the wall, so that people could sit on all four sides; the six rough benches which per hansa and hans olsa had hastily nailed together were now filled to capacity, mostly by women, young children, and older people who were not able to stay on their feet so long.

the beds stood in one corner of the room, the stove in another; in the third were the minister and the table; in the fourth, and on every available part of the floor, people were packed like sardines. as many as the room would actually hold had crowded in, eager to see the minister. but not all who had come could gain an entrance; quite a c

 she gave in. and now i don't know whether i did right or wrong; i believe it hurt her terribly to have the little fellow gone. i saw how she wandered about the room, as if longing to care and do for him, but he was not there. . . . and one night after the plague came--i couldn't lie awake every night, you know--she got up quietly and stole over to the house where he was. . . . she wanted to get the child. whether she intended to do him harm or not, none of us can be sure. she told sörrina and hans olsa that visitors had come from afar, asking to see the boy, and so she must have him; there wasn't any way out of it. yes, that's what she said!"

"the lord has certainly laid a heavy cross upon you! but remember, he will remove it in his own good time! . . . now, tell me, how is she between these attacks?"

that summer a number of houses went up to the westward of spring creek. before the minister had come the first time, hans olsa had already hauled the materials for both dwelling and barn; now he was building. after the first year he had gone into stock raising; he had the largest herd in the settlement, and was doing very well--for those days. . . . and tönseten, after receiving absolution for his great sin, had become all aglow with high ambitions; his prospects were bright of being elected klokker--perhaps deacon, too; life for him was positively glorious, just one grand song. all day his head was full of the idea t

in the fall henry solum built an immense barn; he saw that hans olsa had done well by raising cattle, and intended to follow his example; the dwelling house could wait until he got some one to take care of it--and that might be next summer, if everything went as it should. . . . east of the creek, too, framed houses were rising above the sod huts. the irish, west by the sloughs, were a little slower about building; there things made scant progress until the following year. the pest had raged worse in that locality than anywhere else, because the land lay lower.

he refused to stop for dinner; having hastily drunk a bowl of milk, he got into his cart at once and drove off. . . . the cart shook and rattled; the old nag ambled along; the minister sat immersed in a deep gloom. . . . "never before," he thought, "have i failed so miserably in any service!"

it rained both monday and tuesday, but not so hard that hans olsa had to stop building. with two carpenters to help him, he made such good progress that the day was gone even before it had begun--or so it seemed to him. which was hardly to be wondered at, because from morning till night could be heard rumbling out of the caverns of his bulky chest a continuous monotone that was seriously meant to be a song; as steady and deliberate as everything he did--as he himself was, for that matter--the vocal performance droned and rumbled on and never came to an end; a

nd so each day proved too short, both for himself and his song.

yes, now hans olsa was building himself a real house, and he sang all day at his work. and why shouldn't he sing? this was going to be a beautiful house, larger--very much larger, in fact--than he had originally planned; it was to have a roomy kitchen, both a dining room and a parlor, with three bedrooms upstairs and two downstairs.

concerning the matter of bedrooms on the ground floor, there had been a long-drawn argument between him and sörine; not a serious disagreement, exactly, but--well, they had talked a

bout it a great deal! hans olsa was never in the habit of saying unkind things to his wife; and sörine always smiled, even when she was provoked; so a real quarrel between the two was hard to raise. but in this instance she held tenaciously to her idea that there must be a bedroom downstairs, no matter how many others he might build elsewhere; and that plan called for an addition to the house, which seemed a needless extravagance. and it was so unlike her--she was never known to be extravagant! so he had tried to reason the

idea out of her head; but he finally had had to give it up as a bad job. and since there was no way out of building an addition, while he was about it, he thought, he might as well extend it clear across the house. thus it had come about that there were to be two extra bedrooms downstairs. . . . very unwise, a needless expense, and so utterly unlike her; but there stood the framework, all complete. nothing to do about it now.

that sörine was a real gift from on high no one knew better than hans olsa himself and now, this particular summer, there was nothing that he would not gladly have done for her. ever since last spring, when she had confided to him that she was with child, he had been in a state of blissful anticipation--this time he felt sure that it would be a boy. hence the new house--hence the song. as soon as she had told him the great news he had come to the decision that that event should never take place in the old sod house; and if it meant such a lot to her to get that room d

ownstairs, she certainly should have it, no matter how unreasonable it might be.

hans olsa was fully aware, these days, how everything was arranging itself for his benefit, and he walked about in a state of blissful contentment and thankfulness; his herd had steadily increased from year to year; every season he got more and more land under cultivation; there must be an end to the plague some time, so all wise men said; here, where there was not a human being to be seen the year they came, large settlements were now springing up; the soil was good, the rain and the sunshine were plent

iful. and now he was building a mansion for him who was coming. . . . how marvellous it all was! . . . hans olsa was both a sensible and a serious-minded man; but he would gladly have built two more rooms if she had asked for them, just to show his gratitude. . . .

he had been present at the service last sunday, had taken part in the communion; and the longer the service had lasted the stronger and deeper had grown his felicity. he was only a common, uneducated man, and probably lacked a proper conception of the wonders the minister preached about; yet this he knew for certain, that nothing so glorious a

s that communion service in per hansa's sod house had he ever before experienced, and the happiness of that hour was still glowing with steady warmth in hans olsa's heart. . . . as per hansa and beret had knelt before the chest, he had looked at them, thinking of many things. beret's sad condition could easily be seen in her face. ah no, when reason once leaves a person, it seldom returns! . . . and per hansa himself had become an old man long before his time: his hair and beard were grey; his face was thin and worn; not till then had hans olsa fully realized the terrible struggle his lifelong friend was going through. he had gazed at the kneeling couple

f a man to impose on others. . . . he doubted very much, as a matter of fact, if per hansa fully realized the seriousness of beret's condition. should the plague return this summer and that awful spell come over her again, there was no telling what might happen. . . . "isn't it really up to us, who can see the true state of affairs?"

sörine gave an unexpected answer to this question: "i believe that beret is jealous of me because i'm so fond of her little boy. . . . i think i've noticed it."

hans olsa pondered this information awhile. . . . perhaps his wife was right; and there were other difficulties, too. . . . suppose they did take the boy. could they be certain that he would thrive better here? and if he didn't, where would be the gain? . . . and would it be fair to the parents even to suggest such a thing? . . . at any rate, if things came to such a pass that per hansa had to send beret away--which wasn't at all improbable--then some one would have to take the child permanently. . . . a

nd just now, wouldn't it be too great a burden for sörine? . . . no, hans olsa couldn't quite see his way clear. . . .

sörine only laughed at him. . . . certainly she would undertake to be a mother to that blessed dear little boy--it would be only one more--that is, if it ever seemed necessary. but she doubted very much if per hansa would consent to the plan; he thought more of that boy than of any of the other children, unless she was much mistaken. . . . they discussed the matter at great length that evening.

putting the work away, beret stepped quickly out of the door, stealthily crossed the yard to the side of the new barn, and pressed herself close to the wall. . . . oh, this was hans olsa! it was all right, then--he certainly didn't need any more hauling.

she was straightening up to return, when something arrested her--kind words spoken slowly in a deep voice. . . . hush! hush! they ought not to talk that way about her when she was listening!

. . . "should beret get another spell, you know what might happen--a calamity none of us could get over. we've all seen enough of such things. . . . now, we will take the boy and care for him as though he were our own flesh and blood. . .

as beret drank in these words the tenseness all left her; the weapon she had seized dropped from her hand; her body straightened up; she looked about in wide-eyed wonder. . . . were those church bells she heard? . . . but the voices were beginning again on the other side of the wall. . . . hush! hush!

. . . "do you really think so?" asked hans olsa, seriously.

. . . "well, i tell you, hans olsa, there's hardly an angle to this affair that i have not considered. i'm thinking of nothing else, when i'm asleep as well as when i'm awake. and this i do know," he added with great certainty, "that a kinder person than beret the lord never made; there's nothing but kindness in her. . . . i've come to the conclusion that even in her beclouded moments she has meant no harm to the child--no matter how things may have looked to us. . . . when all is

. . . "you mustn't feel hurt about the offer," put in the slow voice of hans olsa. "we only thought it might do a little good."

beret listened no more; she walked away like one in a dream of happiness; she did not know where she was going nor what she did. in the southern sky floated transparent little clouds; rainbow ribbons hung down from them. she saw the rainbow's glow; her face was transfigured; she walked on in ecstasy. . . . "are there signs for us in the sky? . . . that is the glory of the lord now . . . see! . . . the whole heavens are full of it! . . . there . . .

the mildness of the afternoon greeted her like a friend. she breathed in the pure air deeply, straightening her body, throwing back her arms. . . . what fine weather, these days! . . . the trees around the yard caught her eye; again she had the feeling of having just returned from a long journey. the idea! look how big that grove is getting to be! . . . over on the prairie, some distance away, rose a half-finished house. well, that's hans olsa's. it will be fine for sörrina to move into that new house! no matter how good care you take of a sod house, it's never very satisfactory--dust and dirt keep falling from the ceiling all the time, especially when it gets old. . . . but who was that tall, stooping man coming out of the barn? now he had greeted her quietly in a deep voice and walked on. . . . beret began to be worried. wasn't that hans olsa? didn't she know her own neighbour? . . . hearing some one still in the barn, she hurried

"are you getting up already?" she asked, greatly surprised. "i really think you ought to stay in bed the rest of the day."

"oh, well . . . !" he laughed boisterously, rose to his feet, and stretched himself. "i guess i'd better hurry up and get that rickety roof fixed. . . . we must begin building here as soon as hans olsa can find time to help with the hauling! . . . by god, we're not going to live like moles all our days! . . . that drink of yours was pretty good. have you got a drop left?" he came forward and began pacing up and down the room. . . . "god!" . . . but then he checked himself in time, caught permand in his arms, and flung him up to the ceiling again and again, until the boy shrieked with delight.

"my, my, how funny we all are to-day!" smiled beret as she stood there with the bowl in her hands, w

nths, they would be a horrible sight.

and the same thing happened to people: some disappeared like the cattle; others fell ill with the cough; people died needlessly, for want of a doctor's care; they did not even have the old household remedies--nothing of any kind. and when some one died, he was laid out in what the family could spare, and put away in a snowbank--until some later day. . . . there would be many burials in the settlement next spring.

the third quarter-section which hans olsa owned lay near the creek, north of solums'. this he had fenced in and was using as a pasture for a large herd. during the summer he did not need to look after the cattle at all, except to give them salt; the grass was plentiful up north and they could drink at the creek. the preceding year the herd had pastured there until late in the fall. this year he had hauled over all the straw he could spare, and had bought more where he could find it. then he had built a shed of poles and banked it in wi

ame flying out of the west, filling the whole sky with a grey, woolly blanket. as the wind stiffened steadily throughout the morning, the flakes grew smaller and finer; but for all that, they fell in a thicker cloud. by noon, heaven and earth were a swirl of drifting snow. the west wind cut in more and more savagely; it waxed to a fury at times, driving the snow-flakes before it with such violence that they were pinned to the walls. . . . as the afternoon wore on, the weather became so bad that hans olsa thought it best to go over north and look after the cattle. had he not been so familiar with the lay of the land, or had he not known how to take his bearings by the direction of the wind, he would never have been able to find the place.

things were in pretty bad shape there. most of the straw had been blown away from the west side of the shed. the cattle had left the open inclosure, and had sought what shelter they could find to leeward of the straw stacks on the north side. at a glance he sa

 them out. with the snow beating on him, and the wind constantly taking his breath away, he found this a tough job; but he kept on at it without pause, though the sweat was pouring from him in streams.

the evening was gone when he had finished. round about him lay the night, full of a whirling menace thicker, more desperate, than he had ever seen before--a surge which the wind drove before it in roaring breakers; in the eddies around the corners it was impossible to keep one's eyes open. . . . hans olsa stood at the door of the shed, his work done, looking out at the storm; he was so weary that every limb trembled. at last he started out mechanically, walked a few steps, but had to stop to catch his breath. then he began to realize that in this darkness, with such a blizzard raging, he would never be able to steer a straight course home. he felt his way back to the shed, went in again, and remained standing in the door. . . . his mind was too exhausted to think clearly; something kept telling

quiet, regular breathing--up . . . down; up . . . down--like a light undertow on a summer's day. if only he could have such pleasant warmth in front of him, too! involuntarily he stretched out his arms, caught hold of the first creature he came to, and raised himself up sufficiently to drag it close to him. fearing that he might have hurt the poor thing, he began to pet it and talk to it. . . . really, now, he was as comfortable as a man could expect to be on such a night--anywhere but at home. hans olsa settled back and curled himself up snugly between the animals.

the gusts of wind shook and tore at the frail shelter. the storm raged terribly; all evil powers were loose that night. the worst of it was that it had turned so bitterly cold. through every crack in the shed the snow came whirling; it settled everywhere, piling itself up in little mounds, which the wind alternately levelled and raised again, as it sucked and swirled through the place. . . . hans olsa began to twitch violently; he

"well, well," he assented, as if tired of arguing. "that may be right--it may be." . . . pulling himself together, he went out of the shed and started off before the wind. . . .

that night hans olsa received his death blow. he stumbled into his own house in the small hours of the morning; he was then so exhausted that he could not get his clothes off unaided. . . . sörine had been up all night, well-nigh crazed with fear; twice she had started to go to per hansa's for help, but the storm had driven her back each time; then she had lighted a candle and placed it in the window, in hopes of its doing some good. she had fed the fire with desperate resolution, trying to face the fact that now

for two full days the blizzard raged. during the forenoon of the third day the snow ceased falling and the storm abated; but the air was still grey and bitterly cold. as soon as hans olsa saw that the storm was really letting up, he told sofie to put on her skis and go over to get per hansa. "this will never do," he said to his wife. "for three day and nights you haven't been out of your clothes. i may be a long time in getting over the cough." . . . he wanted to say more, but the words were lost in a paroxysm of coughing.

shoes, carrying an odd-looking bag on her back. she warmed herself at the fire, went into the bedroom, and looked at the suffering man. then she asked for a kettle and opened her bag; first she took out four large onions; these she cut into tiny bits and dumped into the kettle; then she opened a bottle of vile-smelling stuff and poured some of its contents on the onions; at last she set the kettle over the fire and let it boil awhile. from this mixture she made thick poultices, which she put on hans olsa's back and chest; but before she put them on she took out of her pocket a small rusty crucifix, mumbled some words over it, and stuck it into the poultice which was to lie on his chest. as she fixed these applications she made the sign of the cross over his chest and back. all the while she was muttering strange words, in a language they did not understand--whether a prayer or something worse they could not say. these poultices were to be kept on for twelve hours, she explained in broken englis

h, and hot cloths must be put over them to keep them warm. when the twelve hours were gone they must make a fresh poultice. she instructed sörine how to make it--with onions, a cup of linseed oil, one cup of fresh milk, and some flour. they must take good care of the crucifix, she said; she would hold them responsible for it. after giving some more good advice, she wished them god's blessing, put her bag on her back, fastened her snowshoes, and trudged away.

both sörine and hans olsa had faith in the woman and were glad that she had come. . . . one must try such remedies as one had. . . .

per hansa was very busy that forenoon; there was much to do at his own place, and more at his neighbour's. he had hurried home from hans olsa's after going for bridget; had called the two boys, and taken them with him at once to look after the cattle up north. before he left he told beret briefly how things were at their neighbour's, and asked her to arrange her own work so that she could

 go over toward evening and stay there for the night. it might be late before he could get back. . . .

at supper time tönseten called at per hansa's as he was going by. he was on his way home from the east part of the settlement, and just wanted to drop in to see how they were after the storm. when he heard the news about hans olsa--how he had come down with such a bad cough, that it was doubtful if he would pull through--he decided to go over at once and tell sörine what to do. if anyone in these parts knew all there was to know about a cough, he was the man! tönseten was in an extraordinarily bright humour that evening. he told per hansa not to worry, if it was nothing worse than the cough; put on his skis and started off for hans olsa's.

out in the bedroom lay the sick man, propped up by pillows; little-hans sat at

to-night tönseten could think only of how serious things looked for hans olsa; he went straight to the bedside, and said in a tone of voice that was meant to be cheerful: "i'm surprised at you, hans olsa! . . . what do you mean by lying here like this, you slugabed? and here you have the finest ski-slide the lord ever made, clear from your housetop all the way down to my place!" . . . the sick man's face brightened as he looked into tönseten's merry eyes; a breath of fresh air flurried from out the red, icicled beard; the whole face bending above him radiated good humou

tönseten now began to feel that the right atmosphere had been established; he hummed a tune, took a chair, and sat down beside the bed. without further prelude, he started to relate what had happened to him that day. . . . yesterday morning, when kjersti had tried to make the fire, the stove wouldn't draw and the room had filled with smoke; not being able to manage the thing, she had come and roused him. he had got up, had dressed, and then tried to open the door, only to fi

 day, when there!--he'd burst out laughing again, and laughed so hard that they all had to join in. and this had thrown johannes into such a good humour that he had hunted up a bottle which he was saving for the coming event, and had given tönseten a drop or two--perhaps it was three--well, it may have been four--if one must be accurate. . . . all this about the stove, and the steps, and kjersti, and about how he had had to take to his heels in order to find peace, he related in epic detail to hans olsa--there seemed to be need of something jolly here! . . . but the number of drinks he really had had, he didn't fully reveal.

there was something so infectious about tönseten's good spirits that they almost coaxed hans olsa into a brighter mood. but then a spell of coughing came on; he choked it back and asked if kjersti hadn't hurt herself pretty badly?

"oh no, boys, never you fear!" hiccoughed tönseten, wiping his eyes with the backs of his hands. "she's all right, except for a few scratche

 must have solemn things to think about now. she wanted to talk them over with him, but did not like to disturb his thoughts yet awhile. during the early part of the night they exchanged few words. but along toward morning the paroxysms of coughing became more frequent and violent; there were times when they almost choked him. once she grew frightened and got up to hold his head; his face was turning blue as he struggled for breath; then she said, slowly: "now i think you must prepare yourself, hans olsa."

he turned his head sharply and looked at her. . . . "prepare myself?" . . .

"you will hardly be able to stand this very much longer."

the big bulk of hans olsa lay very quiet; only his hand was moving nervously over the cover; his eyes had a questioning, startled look. . . . "well . . . many have got over the cough." . . .

she did not answer him. after a while he added, thoughtfully, "it will be worse for those who are left." . . .

"you ought not to say that, hans olsa--their time has no

t yet come. but remember that for you the day of grace is nearly over." she spoke quietly and compassionately, in a tone of voice which, whenever she used it, always carried conviction by its confident faith.

for a long time hans olsa made no reply; he turned his face to the wall and closed his eyes. beret stood looking at him. . . . "he does not like what i said. that's how we are, we sinners. but i am glad i said it. i don't believe he will ever get up again."

. . . "oh, well," murmured hans olsa after a while. "he has had mercy on many a sinner before. i suppose there will be a little left for me, too." . . .

a great eagerness suddenly welled up in beret's soul. . . . "if only you will bring him a contrite heart! but how can one forgive the erring child who does not repent? . . . woe unto you that are rich!--for ye have received your consolation. . . . woe unto you that are full!--for ye shall hunger. . . . woe unto you that laugh now!--for ye shall weep and mourn. . . . oh no, we can

is breath again; completely exhausted, he turned his face to the wall, and it looked as if he might drop off to sleep. . . . he lay perfectly quiet a long time.

beret knit steadily until her hands grew tired; she wondered if she couldn't find something to do for sörine, took the lamp and went into the kitchen. here she found a great pile of coarse hay stacked against the wall; she set to work at once, making twists of it for the fire. all the while she was thinking about her conversation with hans olsa. . . . "it will seem strange not to meet hans olsa in the hereafter--that it will. in the old country we grew up together. . . . they are good folk, both he and she. . . . and now he is starting out on his long journey--and will not pass through the heavenly gates! . . . his mother, ellen, was a very godfearing woman; his father i didn't know, but i never heard a word against him. . . . now they have waited there for him these many years; it will be hard for me to meet them some day and tell th

 of things here." . . .

she went into the bedroom again, to see if she could do anything for the sick man. he was awake when she came in; his manner showed that he had been waiting for her.

"how is the weather outside?" he asked, slowly. "would it be possible for a man to travel in it?"

"what do you say?" she came close to the bed.

"could we try to get the doctor, do you suppose? . . . others out here have had him." . . .

"we shall see when daylight comes. . . . but how about the minister, hans olsa?"

"the minister?"

"yes--when the lord's hour is at hand, man's help is of no avail; for from his wrath no man can flee! . . . what you need most of all is communion, hans olsa!"

"communion . . . ? well . . . yes . . . i suppose so . . . that is true."

"it is terrible to fall into the hands of the living god," said beret, quietly, and looked into his face with sorrowful despair. "there is nothing but evil in us--yes, nothing! but when he comes to us in holy communion, laying his merciful han

y; it gave her greater courage to go on. . . . "that's why you must seek him here, before you meet him face to face yonder!" she cried, exultantly. "now i will pray for you." . . . without waiting for his consent, she knelt beside the bed and began to pray earnestly, with sweet compassion vibrating through her mellow voice, that he who now lay here might be given the grace to see his sin and to repent before the door had closed.

but she had hardly begun when something stopped the prayer. . . . hans olsa had reared himself up on his elbows when she had sunk to her knees beside the bed, and had remained in this position, staring at her wide-eyed. as he heard how she pleaded for him he was seized with a sudden convulsion of coughing; he sat up frantically in bed, gasping for breath. the bedclothes fell off him, the poultices slipped down, and beret had to leave her praying to attend to him. and when he was quiet again he asked to have his milk warmed; then he had to get up; from that he got an at

ometimes didn't even have that much. but the people there would borrow a sack of wheat from anybody who had one; and if they had no coffee mill in the house, they would use a mortar, or improvise one from a kettle. folks were cheerful about helping one another in those days. what one didn't have, he borrowed; if one got a new idea, he passed it on to his neighbours. the scarcity of fuel caused the most suffering, for hay burned like hay, even if twisted.

tönseten was sitting in the bedroom at hans olsa's when per hansa came back after supper. he was downhearted and quiet to-day. kjersti had been in bed most of the time because of the stiffness and soreness from her fall; and she was so cross, he explained, that if a fellow as much as looked at her she would bite his head off. he had had the devil to pay, with taking care of both her and himself and doing the chores besides. . . . as he noticed how flushed hans olsa's face was and heard how he struggled for breath, he wondered if his own cough

 had ever been as bad as this. if this was worse than he had had it three years ago, the man would never be able to throw it off. . . . but he kept the thought to himself.

things had been in a bad way with hans olsa all that day; the coughing spells had come oftener; he had been restless and fretful; had asked first for one thing, and then for another, and was always inquiring about the weather. at that moment he happened to be quiet; when all at once he began to talk about the inevitable. . . . he asked both of his neighbours to help sörine when he was gone, and to give her their best advice about running the farm, just as he would have done for them, if either one of them had been in his place. . . . "p

 need help from all of you!"

thus it came about that per hansa watched with him that night. sörine lay down in the other room, fully dressed. the door between the rooms stood open. she intended to doze only a minute and not lose herself so completely that she couldn't jump up to help when the worst spells came on; but she had tramped about working in the snow nearly all day, and was so worn out that she soon dropped off into a sound sleep.

after all had been quiet in the house for some time, hans olsa looked up and asked, in a needlessly loud voice, if his wife was asleep. when no answer came from the other room, he lay still for quite a while, gazing up with his eyes fixed on space; then he began, in a calm, matter-of-fact way, to tell per hansa how he thought everything ought to be arranged after he was gone. he mentioned first a couple of little debts which he had in sioux falls; then he spoke of several of the new settlers who owed him for seed and cattle, and stipulated how much each wa

d then he had to stop for breath. per hansa only nodded his replies; all he could think of to say was: "don't worry. . . . is there anything else now? . . . i will take care of everything."

little by little per hansa got the feeling that his friend had something on his mind; he could not tell exactly why he felt that way, but the impression grew stronger and stronger. every time a pause came over the sick man's talk, he expected to hear what it was. but there seemed to be nothing more. at last hans olsa fell silent; he was still looking straight ahead of him; but now he began to be very restless. a violent fit of coughing shook his frame. from out that great chest of his came a dreadful wheezing, grating sound, as from an old pair of leaky bellows when they are blown up hard.

when the cough had eased itself, hans olsa began once more his frightened groping among the things of the future; but now he spoke less coherently. after midnight he had a quiet spell when he lay as if exhausted and said

"is it as bad as that?" . . . the sick man sighed heavily, his hands fidgeting with the covers; then he repeated in a low voice: "so--is it as deep as that?"

"was there something on your mind?"

"then it isn't possible to get anywhere!" . . . the powerful jaws closed; drops of sweat stood out on the great, shiny face.

per hansa's heart stirred with a nameless dread; he felt himself grow dizzy, but he cleared his throat and said, firmly:

"what is it that you want, hans olsa? . . . do you want the doctor?"

the sick man turned toward him.

"oh--it's the minister i need!" . . . then, after a moment, he added: "but don't you think the weather will be better in a day or two?" . . .

he lay perfectly still. when he got no answer he looked up and repeated, imploringly:

"don't you think so?"

per hansa rose to his feet and began pacing back and forth across the floor. it must be very close in here . . . he felt so faint. thinking of how it was outdoors, he suddenly foun

"hush, now! hush, now, man! don't talk blasphemy!" cried per hansa. "lie down, now. . . . see here . . . the covers are falling off you!"

the bulky form had reared itself violently up in bed. through a paroxysm of coughing hans olsa whimpered:

"tell sörrina to come here!"

it looked for a moment as if he were passing away in the midst of the attack. hans olsa himself thought so. in wild alarm, per hansa resorted to pounding the sick man's back, just as one does with children when they have swallowed the wrong way. but after a while the spell gradually left him, as the others had done. he settled back, and a little later fell into a deep sleep, which lasted till morning.

the first rays of daylight woke sörine. her husba

nd was already awake by that time, and seemed better. per hansa put on his coat and prepared to go; he had all his own work to do at home, besides hans olsa's cattle up north to look after.

hans olsa watched him get ready, following all his movements with a pathetic sadness like that which stands in a dog's eyes when he watches his master go away without him. then he called him over to the bedside and asked him again what the weather was like. there was an odd little quiver in his voice as he said, almost as though he were ashamed:

"i suppose it's still impossible to get anywhere?"

per hansa felt like laughing at such childishness in a grown-up man; he scarcely knew what to answer. but an

swer he must; so he braced himself, buttoned his big coat, put on his mittens, and said, firmly: "you ought to lie still and sleep awhile longer, hans olsa. . . . during the night you slept like a rock--and see how much better you are already! . . . i promise you that i'll be back some time later in the day."

"you don't think it can be done?"

nameless dread again seized per hansa. he stepped back and said, hastily: "calm yourself now, hans olsa! . . . we'll have to see about it--you understand."

the sick man reached out toward him, caught his hand and held it tightly, with something of his old strength. . . . "oh, per hansa!" he cried. . . . "there never was a man like you . . . !" and fell back on the pillow, exhausted.

in more and more of concern for him; and little by little it got to be almost exclusively for him. as he sat there listening it sounded to him as if he were the most hardened sinner in all christendom; he would feel ashamed before the children, would find some pretext to steal out of the house. but he couldn't bring it across his heart to speak to her; for how can one reason with a child that is so delicate as she, he thought.

 

in the grey light of dawn per hansa returned from the bedside of hans olsa, looking like a man who had reached the end of his rope. he hung up his coat and hat and sat down at the table in the large kitchen to eat his breakfast. off and on he glanced out of the window. while beret brought him his food, she asked how things were over at hans olsa's. at first she got very little satisfaction; his answers were short and taciturn, and he seemed engrossed in his own thoughts. he ate slowly and took a long time over the meal; all the while he kept looking out of the window.

 hear his prayer! some one must go for the minister at once."

per hansa did not move; he was staring off into space. beret crossed the floor, her hands full of dishes, and stopped directly in front of him. . . . "you must persuade some one to go with you. this is terrible weather! . . . could you try going on horseback?"

"huh--horseback! how you talk!"

"but it is an awful thing for a soul to be cast into hell when human beings can prevent it!"

per hansa seemed amused at this idea. "well, if hans olsa is bound in that direction, there'll be a good many more from here in the same boat! . . . he'll land in the right place, don't worry."

the words sounded so blasphemous to beret that she could not repress a shudder of horror. greatly wrought up, she set the dishes down on the table and said, fiercely: "you know what our life has been: land and houses, and then more land, and cattle! that has been his whole concern--that's been his very life. now he is beginning to think about not having laid u

"i suppose i don't understand anything, do i?" said per hansa in a tone of disgust. "perhaps i don't understand, for instance--though god knows it would not be difficult for any grown person to see it--that no man could cross the prairie from here to the james river, as things are now, and come out alive--. . . as for hans olsa, the lord will find him good enough, even without either minister or klokker--that i truly believe!"

"the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not! . . . here lies one who is about to receive his sight, and we will not reach out a hand to help him!"

"hold your tongue, beret!" cried per hansa, sharply, anger at the hopelessness of the argument getting the better of him. "do you want to drive me out into the jaws of death?"

"what horrible things you say, per hansa!"

h no, no! she caught herself, how can i be thinking of such things again! the sweet desires of the flesh are the nets of satan. . . . how deeply sin has besoiled all life! . . . beret went about her work with a greater determination; but her sad mood did not lift.

a hundred things were waiting for per hansa outside, but he was so angry that he scarcely noticed what he was about. . . . the world seemed upside down to-day. . . . that grown people couldn't see an inch beyond their noses! here lay hans olsa, driving himself out of his mind because he couldn't have a minister--when there was no better man than himself in all christendom! . . . and here was beret insisting that he leap right into the arms of death--she who had a heart so tender that she couldn't harm a mouse! . . . people could certainly twist things around in a queer way! all his life he had worked and slaved in order that she and the children might be made comfortable . . . and now it was flung in his face and he was taunted with

when the boys came out they all put on their skis and started across the snowdrifts to hans olsa's north quarter. the day was bleak; a cold air was drawing in from the west. to store-hans, all these fields of snow were glorious; now he could skim like a bird over the drifts. little by little per hansa forgot his temper as he caught the infection of the boy's exuberant joy.

while they were working over the cattle, per hansa talked in a steady stream to the boys. all this snow, he said, promised a bumper crop next summer--you could depend on that! . . . one of his moods of high good humour

just as per hansa reached the yard at home sörine was coming out of the kitchen door; she went over to the wall of the house, took a pair of skis that stood there, and put them on. he noticed that she was very thinly clad. she had a shawl over her head, but wore no other outdoor wrap. he concluded at once that she must have left home in a hurry, and feared that the worst had happened. . . . was anything wrong? he asked. . . . no, hans olsa didn't seem much worse; she thought he looked a little better. but her face was sad and she looked down as she spoke. . . . bridget had been to see him again and had said there was no hope. . . . "and i guess there isn't, either," she went on. "but i had to come over and ask your advice, per hansa. . . . he said that you were going after the minister for him. and i suppose that might be a good thing to do; at any rate, he is very happy about it. . . . but now, of course, i see that it's impossi

re awhile, looking out; then she crossed to the wall where her outdoor clothes hung, and began to put them on. this attracted per hansa's attention.

. . . was she going out? he asked.

. . . yes. . . . she put on one of his coats over her own wrap, then pulled his big stocking cap over her head.

he looked up a second time.

"are you going far? you seem to be wrapping up a good deal."

she waited a moment before she answered.

"i have to talk to henry. . . . some one must go on this errand for hans olsa!" her face was flushed with determination and her eyes shone with a quiet light.

per hansa burst into a laugh and scrambled to his feet.

"you'll have to behave yourself now, woman," he said, like a man trying to talk reason into a naughty child. "you ought to know that this is no weather for a woman to be out in."

"it's no weather for men to be out in, either, by the way it looks in here!"

about halfway across the stretch from colton to the james river a cluster of low hills' rear themselves out of the prairie. here and there among them a few stray settlers had already begun to dig in.

on one of the hillsides stood an old haystack which a settler had left there when he found out that the coarse bottom hay wasn't much good for fodder. one day during the spring after hans olsa had died, a troop of young boys were ranging the prairies, in search of some yearling cattle that had gone astray. they came upon the haystack, and stood transfixed. on the west side of the stack sat a man, with his back to the mouldering hay. this was in the middle of a warm day in may, yet the man had two pairs of skis along with him; one pair lay beside him on the ground, the other was tied to his back. he had a heavy stocking cap pulled well down over his forehead, and large mittens on his
