 the escape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me. the mimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the routine of school in the morning because i wanted real adventures to happen to myself. but real adventures, i reflected, do not happen to people who remain at home: they must be sought abroad.
the summer holidays were near at hand when i made up my mind to break out of the weariness of school-life for one day at least. with leo dillon and a boy named mahony i planned a day’s miching. each of us saved up sixpence. we were to meet at ten in the morning on the canal bridge. mahony’s big sister was to write an excuse for him and leo dillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick. we arranged to go along the wharf road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the ferryboat and walk out to see the pigeon house. leo dillon was afraid we might meet father butler or someone out of the college; but mahony asked, very sensibly, what would father b

utler be doing out at the pigeon house. we were reassured: and i brought the first stage of the plot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two, at the same time showing them my own sixpence. when we were making the last arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited. we shook hands, laughing, and mahony said:
“till tomorrow, mates!”
that night i slept badly. in the morning i was first-comer to the bridge as i lived nearest. i hid my books in the long grass near the ashpit at the end of the garden where nobody ever came and hurried along the canal bank. it was a mild sunny morning in the first week of june. i sat up on the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas shoes which i had diligently pipeclayed overnight and watching the docile horses pulling a tramload of business people up th

e hill. all the branches of the tall trees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and the sunlight slanted through them on to the water. the granite stone of the bridge was beginning to be warm and i began to pat it with my hands in time to an air in my head. i was very happy.
when i had been sitting there for five or ten minutes i saw mahony’s grey suit approaching. he came up the hill, smiling, and clambered up beside me on the bridge. while we were waiting he brought out the catapult which bulged from his inner pocket and explained some improvements which he had made in it. i asked him why he had brought it and he told me he had brought it to have some gas with the birds. mahony used slang freely, and spoke of father butler as old bunser. we waited on for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of leo dillon. maho

ny, at last, jumped down and said:
“come along. i knew fatty’d funk it.”
“and his sixpence...?” i said.
“that’s forfeit,” said mahony. “and so much the better for us—a bob and a tanner instead of a bob.”
we walked along the north strand road till we came to the vitriol works and then turned to the right along the wharf road. mahony began to play the indian as soon as we were out of public sight. he chased a crowd of ragged girls, brandishing his unloaded catapult and, when two ragged boys began, out of chivalry, to fling stones at us, he proposed that we should charge them. i objected that the boys were too small and so we walked on, the ragged troop screaming after us: “swaddlers! swaddlers!” thinking that we were protestants because mahony, who was dark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his ca

t for our immobility by the drivers of groaning carts. it was noon when we reached the quays and, as all the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches, we bought two big currant buns and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside the river. we pleased ourselves with the spectacle of dublin’s commerce—the barges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly smoke, the brown fishing fleet beyond ringsend, the big white sailing-vessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay. mahony said it would be right skit to run away to sea on one of those big ships and even i, looking at the high masts, saw, or imagined, the geography which had been scantily dosed to me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes. school and home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us seemed to wane.
we crossed the liffey in the ferryboat, paying our toll to be transported in the company of two labourers and a little jew with a bag. we were serious to the point of solemnity, but

 every time the planks fell:
“all right! all right!”
when we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into ringsend. the day had grown sultry, and in the windows of the grocers’ shops musty biscuits lay bleaching. we bought some biscuits and chocolate which we ate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid streets where the families of the fishermen live. we could find no dairy and so we went into a huckster’s shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each. refreshed by this, mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped into a wide field. we both felt rather tired and when we reached the field we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we could see the dodder.
it was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of visiting the pigeon house. we had to be home before four o’clock lest our adventure should be discovered. mahony looked regretfully at his catapult and i had to suggest going home by train before he regained any cheerfulness.

me of one’s life was undoubtedly one’s school-boy days and that he would give anything to be young again. while he expressed these sentiments which bored us a little we kept silent. then he began to talk of school and of books. he asked us whether we had read the poetry of thomas moore or the works of sir walter scott and lord lytton. i pretended that i had read every book he mentioned so that in the end he said:
“ah, i can see you are a bookworm like myself. now,” he added, pointing to mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, “he is different; he goes in for games.”
he said he had all sir walter scott’s works and all lord lytton’s works at home and never tired of reading them. “of course,” he said, “there were some of lord lytton’s works which boys couldn’t read.” mahony asked why couldn’t boys read them—a question which agitated and pained me because i was afraid the man would think i was as stupid as mahony. the man, however, only smiled. i saw that he h

ad great gaps in his mouth between his yellow teeth. then he asked us which of us had the most sweethearts. mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties. the man asked me how many had i. i answered that i had none. he did not believe me and said he was sure i must have one. i was silent.
“tell us,” said mahony pertly to the man, “how many have you yourself?”
the man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots of sweethearts.
“every boy,” he said, “has a little sweetheart.”
his attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man of his age. in my heart i thought that what he said about boys and sweethearts was reasonable. but i disliked the words in his mouth and i wondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or felt a sudden chill. as he p

e repeated his phrases over and over again, varying them and surrounding them with his monotonous voice. i continued to gaze towards the foot of the slope, listening to him.
after a long while his monologue paused. he stood up slowly, saying that he had to leave us for a minute or so, a few minutes, and, without changing the direction of my gaze, i saw him walking slowly away from us towards the near end of the field. we remained silent when he had gone. after a silence of a few minutes i heard mahony exclaim:
“i say! look what he’s doing!”
as i neither answered nor raised my eyes mahony exclaimed again:
“i say.... he’s a queer old josser!”
“in case he asks us for our names,” i said, “let you be murphy and i’ll be smith.”
we said nothing further to each other. i was still considering whether i would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us again. hardly had he sat down when mahony, catching sight of the cat which had escaped him, sprang up and pursue

after an interval the man spoke to me. he said that my friend was a very rough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school. i was going to reply indignantly that we were not national school boys to be whipped, as he called it; but i remained silent. he began to speak on the subject of chastising boys. his mind, as if magnetised again by his speech, seemed

tray my agitation i delayed a few moments pretending to fix my shoe properly and then, saying that i was obliged to go, i bade him good-day. i went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles. when i reached the top of the slope i turned round and, without looking at him, called loudly across the field:
“murphy!”
my voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and i was ashamed of my paltry stratagem. i had to call the name again before mahony saw me and hallooed in answer. how my heart beat as he came running across the field to me! he ran as if to bring me aid. and i was penitent; for in my heart i had always despised him a little.

north richmond street, being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when the christian brothers’ school set the boys free. an uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. the other houses of the street, conscious of decent li
