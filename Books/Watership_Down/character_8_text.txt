     it was actually about an hour after moonrise and a good while before midnight
when hazel and fiver once more came out of their burrow behind the brambles
and slipped quietly along the bottom of the ditch. with them was a third rabbit,
hlao -- pipkin -- a friend of fiver. (hlao means any small concavity in the grass
where moisture may collect -- e.g., the dimple formed by a dandelion or thistle
cup.) he too was small, and inclined to be timid, and hazel and fiver had spent
the greater part of their last evening in the warren in persuading him to join
them. pipkin had agreed rather hesitantly. he still felt extremely nervous about
what might happen once they left the warren, and had decided that the best way
to avoid trouble would be to keep

nds. it was only too likely that they would encounter dangers
beyond the warren and that they would stand in need of some good fighters.
again, if fiver was right and the whole warren was in imminent peril, then of
course they ought to welcome any rabbit who was ready to join them. on the
other hand, there seemed no point in taking particular pains to get hold of rabbits
who were going to behave like toadflax.
     "wherever we settle down in the end," thought hazel, "i'm determined to see
that pipkin and fiver aren't sat on and cuffed around until they're ready to run
any risk just to get away. but is bigwig going to see it like that?"
     "you know silver, don't you?" asked bigwig, breaking in on his thoughts.
"apparently some of the younger fellows in the owsla have been giving him a thin
time -- teasing him about his fur, you know, and saying he only got his place
because of the threarah. i thought i was going to get some more, but i suppose
nearly all the owsla feel they're very well o

wandering about the fields in one direction and another, with the risk of finding
themselves, in the end, back at the warren. he decided to go straight into the
wood without consulting bigwig, and to trust that the rest would follow.
     "if we don't run into any trouble and the brook takes us through the wood," he
thought, "we really shall be clear of the warren and then we can look for
somewhere to rest for a bit. most of them still seem to be more or less all right,
but fiver and pipkin will have had as much as they can stand before long."
     from the moment he entered it, the wood seemed full of noises. there was a

smell of damp leaves and moss, and everywhere the splash of water went
whispering about. just inside, the brook made a little fall into a pool, and the
sound, enclosed among the trees, echoed as though in a cave. roosting birds
rustled overhead; the night breeze stirred the leaves; here and there a dead twig
fell. and there were more sinister, unidentified soun

d this for the first time. they had been moving in a group,
or trying to: actually, they had straggled widely at times. they had been trying to
maintain a steady pace, between hopping and running, and it had come hard.
since entering the wood they had been in severe anxiety. several were almost
tharn -- that is, in that state of staring, glazed paralysis that comes over terrified
or exhausted rabbits, so that they sit and watch their enemies -- weasels or
humans -- approach to take their lives. pipkin sat trembling under a fern, his ears
drooping on either side of his head. he held one paw forward in an awkward,
unnatural way and kept licking it miserably. fiver was little better off. he still
looked cheerful, but very weary. hazel realized that until they were rested they
would all be safer where they were than stumbling along in the open with no
strength left to run from an enemy. but if they lay brooding, unable to feed or go
underground, all their troubles would come crowding into their

hearts, their fears
would mount and they might very likely scatter, or even try to return to the
warren. he had an idea.
     "yes, all right, we'll rest here," he said, "let's go in among this fern. come on,
dandelion, tell us a story. i know you're handy that way. pipkin here can't wait to
hear it."
     dandelion looked at pipkin and realized what it was that hazel was asking him
to do. choking back his own fear of the desolate, grassless woodland, the before-
dawn-returning owls that they could hear some way off, and the extraordinary,
rank animal smell that seemed to come from somewhere rather nearer, he began.

ahrairah, 'i am busy. the fox and the weasel are coming. if you want to bless me
you can bless my bottom, for it is sticking out of the hole.'"
     all the rabbits had heard the story before: on winter nights, when the cold
draft moved down the warren passages and the icy wet lay in the pits of the runs
below their burrows; and on summer evenings, in the grass under the red may
and the sweet, carrion-scented elder bloom. dandelion was telling it well, and
even pipkin forgot his weariness and danger and remembered instead the great
indestructibility of the rabbits. each one of them saw himself as el-ahrairah, who
could be impudent to frith and get away with it.
     "then," said dandelion, "frith felt himself in friendship with el-ahrairah, who
would not give up even when he thought the fox and the weasel were coming. and
he said, 'very well, i will bless your bottom as it sticks out of the hole. bottom, be

thout a sound. then bigwig, who
was nearest to the path, turned and slipped back among the others.
     "a lendri," he muttered as he passed through them. "it may be dangerous and
it may not, but i'm taking no chances with it. let's get away."
     they followed him through the fern and very soon came upon another, parallel
path. bigwig turned into it and broke into a run. dandelion overtook him and the
two disappeared among the ilex trees. hazel and the others followed as best they
could, with pipkin limping and staggering behind, his fear driving him on in spite
of the pain in his paw.
     hazel came out on the further side of the ilexes and followed the path round a
bend. then he stopped dead and sat back on his haunches. immediately in front
of him, bigwig and dandelion were staring out from the sheer edge of a high
bank, and below the bank ran a stream. it was in fact the little river enborne,
twelve to fifteen feet wide and at this time of year two or three feet deep with
spring rain,

me."
     "it had killed before it met us," said blackberry with a shudder. "i saw the
blood on its lips."
     "a rat, perhaps, or pheasant chicks. lucky for us it had killed, otherwise it
might have been quicker. still, fortunately we did the right thing. we really came
out of it very well," said bigwig.
     fiver came limping down the path with pipkin. they, too, checked and stared
at the sight of the river.
     "what do you think we ought to do now, fiver?" asked hazel.
     fiver looked down at the water and twitched his ears.
     "we shall have to cross it," he said. "but i don't think i can swim, hazel. i'm
worn out, and pipkin's a good deal worse than i am."
     "cross it?" cried bigwig. "cross it? who's going to cross it? what do you want
to cross it for? i never heard such nonsense."
     like all wild animals, rabbits can swim if

 where rabbits can see and hear all round and men hardly ever
come. wouldn't that be worth a journey?"
     "yes, of course it would. but is there such a place?"
     "not near a river -- i needn't tell you that. but if you cross a river you start
going up again, don't you? we ought to be on the top -- on the top and in the
open."
     "but, fiver, i think they may refuse to go much further. and then again, you
say all this and yet you say you're too tired to swim?"
     "i can rest, hazel, but pipkin's in a pretty bad way. i think he's injured. we
may have to stay here half the day."
     "well, let's go and talk to the others. they may not mind staying. it's crossing
they're not going to fancy, unless something frightens them into it."
     as soon as they had made their way back, bigwig came across to them from the
bushes at the edge of the path.
     "i was wondering where you'd got to," he said to hazel. "are you ready to move
on?"
     "no, i'm not," answered hazel firmly. "i think we

underground by now. what do you think will happen when it picks up our scent,
running from one side of the wood to the other, with dew on it? come on, let's get
over quickly,"
     hazel felt at a loss. in front of him stood bigwig, sodden wet, undaunted,
single-minded -- the very picture of decision. at his shoulder was fiver, silent and
twitching. he saw blackberry watching him intently, waiting for his lead and
disregarding bigwig's. then he looked at pipkin, huddled into a fold of sand,
more panic-stricken and helpless than any rabbit he had ever seen. at this
moment, up in the wood, there broke out an excited yelping and a jay began to
scold.
     hazel spoke through a kind of light-headed trance. "well, you'd better get on,
then," he said, "and anyone else who wants to. personally, i'm going to wait until
fiver and pipkin are fit to tackle it."
     "you silly blockhead!" cried bigwig. "we'll all be finished! we'll--"
     "don't stamp about," s

then?"
     "suggest? there's no suggesting to be done. those who can swim, swim. the

     "i'm afraid that won't do for me. i got pipkin into this and i'm going to get him
out."
     "well, you didn't get fiver into it, did you? he got you into it."
     hazel could not help noticing, with reluctant admiration, that although bigwig
had lost his temper, he was apparently in no hurry on his own account and
seemed less frightened than any of them. looking round for blackberry, he saw
that he had left them and was up at the top of the pool, where the narrow beach
tailed away into a gravel spit. his paws were half buried in the wet g

was nosing at something large and flat on the waterline. it looked like a piece of
wood.
     "blackberry," he said, "can you come back here a moment?"
     blackberry looked up, tugged out his paws and ran back.
     "hazel," he said quickly, "that's a piece of flat wood -- like that piece that closed
the gap by the green loose above the warren -- you remember? it must have
drifted down the river. so it floats. we could put fiver and pipkin on it and make
it float again. it might go across the river. can you understand?"
     hazel had no idea what he meant. blackberry's flood of apparent nonsense
only seemed to draw tighter the mesh of danger and bewilderment. as though
bigwig's angry impatience, pipkin's terror and the approaching dog were not
enough to contend with, the cleverest rabbit among them had evidently gone out
of his mind. he felt close to despair.
     "frithrah, yes, i see!" said an excited voice at his ear. it was

fiver. "quick,
hazel, don't wait! come on, and bring pipkin!"
     it was blackberry who bullied the stupefied pipkin to his feet and forced him to
limp the few yards to the gravel spit. the piece of wood, hardly bigger than a large
rhubarb leaf, was lightly aground. blackberry almost drove pipkin onto it with his
claws. pipkin crouched shivering and fiver followed him aboard.
     "who's strong?" said blackberry. "bigwig! silver! push it out!"
     no one obeyed him. all squatted, puzzled and uncertain. blackberry buried his
nose in the gravel under the landward edge of the board and raised it, pushing.
the board tipped. pipkin squealed and fiver lowered his head and splayed his
claws. then the board righted itself and drifted out a few feet into the pool with
the two rabbits hunched upon it, rigid and motionless. it

     "frith and inlé!" said dandelion. "they're sitting on the water! why don't they
sink?"
     "they're sitting on the wood and the wood floats, can't you see?" said
blackberry. "now we swim over ourselves. can we start, hazel?"
     during the last few minutes hazel had been as near to losing his head as he
was ever to come. he had been at his wits' end, with no reply to bigwig's scornful
impatience except his readiness to risk his own life in company with fiver and
pipkin. he still could not understand what had happened, but at least he realized
that blackberry wanted him to show authority. his head cleared.
     "swim," he said. "everybody swim."
     he watched them as they went in. dandelion swam as well as he ran, swiftly
and easily. silver, too, was strong. the others paddled and scrambled over

wig was still in the water, on the other side of the pool. he had swum to the
raft, put his head against it and was pushing it forward with heavy thrusts of his
back legs. "keep still," hazel heard him say in a quick, gulping voice. then he
sank. but a moment later he was up again and had thrust his head over the back
of the board. as he kicked and struggled, it tilted and then, while the rabbits
watched from the bank, moved slowly across the pool and grounded on the
opposite side. fiver pushed pipkin onto the stones and bigwig waded out beside
them, shivering and breathless.
     "i got the idea once blackberry had shown us," he said. "but it's hard to push it
when you're in the water. i hope it's not long to sunrise. i'm cold. let's get on."
     there was no sign of the dog as they made haste through the alders and up the
field to the first hedgerow. most of them had not understood blackberry's
discovery of the raft and at once forgot it. fiver, however, came over to where
blackberry was

lying against the stem of a blackthorn in the hedge.
     "you saved pipkin and me, didn't you?" he said. "i don't think pipkin's got any
idea what really happened; but i have."
     "i admit it was a good idea," replied blackberry. "let's remember it. it might
come in handy again sometime."

     they became widely separated as they straggled up the slope. silver and bigwig
led the way, with hazel and buckthorn a short distance behind. the rest idled
along, hopping a few yards and then pausing to nibble or to pass droppings on the
warm, sunny grass. silver was almost at the crest when suddenly, from halfway
up, there came a high screaming -- the sound a rabbit makes, not to call for help
or to frighten an enemy, but simply out of terror. fiver and pipkin, limping
behind the others, and conspicuously undersized and tired, were being attacked
by the crow. it had flown low along the ground. then, pouncing, it had aimed a
blow of its great bill at fiver, who just managed to dodge in time. now it was
leaping and hopping among the grass tussocks, striking at the two rabbits with
terrible darts of its head. crows aim at the eyes and pipkin, sensing this, had
buried his head in a clump of rank grass and was trying to burrow further in. it

o it from behind and knocked it sideways, so
that it staggered across the turf with a harsh, raucous cawing of rage.
     "keep at it!" cried bigwig. "come in behind it! they're cowards! they only
attack helpless rabbits."
     but already the crow was making off, flying low with slow, heavy wing beats.
they watched it clear the further hedge and disappear into the wood beyond the
river. in the silence there was a gentle, tearing sound as a grazing cow moved
nearer.
     bigwig strolled over to pipkin, muttering a ribald owsla lampoon.

     "hoi, hoi u embleer hrair,
     m'saion ulé hraka vair."*

     "come on, hlao-roo," he said. "you can get your head out now. having quite a
day, aren't we?"
     he turned away and pipkin tried to follow him. hazel remembered that fiver
had said he thought he was injured. now, as he watched him limping and
staggering up the slope, it occurred to him that he might actually be wounded in
some way. he kept trying to put his near-side front paw to the grou

ly rows of beans, securing them against hostile
approach, roofing them over and covering their scent. they could hardly have
been safer underground. even a little food could be had at a pinch, for here and
there were a few pale twists of grass and here and there a dandelion.
     "we can sleep here all day," said hazel. "but i suppose one of us ought to stay
awake; and if i take the first turn it'll give me a chance to have a look at your paw,
hlao-roo. i think you've got something in it."
     pipkin, who was lying on his left side, breathing quickly and heavily, rolled
over and stretched out his front paw, underside turned upward. hazel peered
closely into the thick, coarse hair (a rabbit's foot has no pads) and after a few
moments saw what he had expected -- the oval shank of a snapped-off thorn
sticking out through the skin. there was a little blood and the flesh was torn.
     "you've got a big thorn in there, hlao," he said. "no wonder you couldn't run.
we'll have to get it out."

getting the thorn out was not easy, for the foot had become so tender that
pipkin winced and pulled away even from hazel's tongue. but after a good deal of
patient effort hazel succeeded in working out enough of the stump to get a grip
with his teeth. the thorn came out smoothly and the wound bled. the spine was
so long and thick that hawkbit, who happened to be close by, woke speedwell to
have a look at it.
     "frith above, pipkin!" said speedwell, sniffing at the thorn where it lay on a
pebble. "you'd better collect a few more like that: then you can make a notice
board and frighten fiver. you might have poked the lendri's eye out for us, if
you'd only known."
     "lick the place, hlao," said hazel. "lick it until it feels better and then go to
sleep."

journeys. the changes in the warmth and dampness of the soil, the falling of the
sunlight patches, the altering movement of the beans in the light wind, the
direction and strength of the air currents along the ground -- all these were
perceived by the rabbit awake.
     the sun was beginning to set when hazel woke to see acorn listening and
sniffing in the silence, between two white-skinned flints. the light was thicker,
the breeze had dropped and the beans were still. pipkin was stretched out a little
way away. a yellow-and-black burying beetle, crawling across the white fur of his
belly, stopped, waved its short, curved antennae and then moved on again. hazel
grew tense with sudden misgiving. he knew that these beetles come to dead
bodies, on which they feed and lay their eggs. they will dig away the earth from
under the bodies of small creatures, such as shrew mice and fallen fledglings, and
then lay their eggs on them before covering them with soil. surely pipki

not have died in his sleep? hazel sat up quickly. acorn started and turned toward
him and the beetle scurried away over the pebbles as pipkin moved and woke.
     "how's the paw?" said hazel.
     pipkin put it to the ground. then he stood on it.
     "it feels much better," he said. "i think i shall be able to go as well as the others
now. they won't leave me behind, will they?"
     hazel rubbed his nose behind pipkin's ear. "no one's going to leave anyone
else behind," he said. "if you had to stay, i'd stay with you. but don't pick up any
more thorns, hlao-roo, because we may have to go a long way."
     the next moment all the rabbits leaped up in panic. from close at hand the
sound of a shot tore across the fields. a peewit rose screaming. the echoes came
back in waves, like a pebble rolling round a box, and from the wood across the
river came the clattering of wood pigeons' wings among the branches. in a

s. obviously, the idea of trying to reach
them was out of the question. it might well prove to be all they could do to find
their way across the heather to some quiet field or copse bank like those they had
been used to. it was lucky that fiver had not come out with this foolish notion in
front of any of the others, especially as there was trouble enough already. if only
he could be persuaded to drop it here and now, there would be no harm done --
unless, indeed, he had already said anything to pipkin.
     "i don't think we could get the others to go as far as that, fiver," he said.
"they're frightened and tired as it is, you know. what we need is to find a safe
place soon, and i'd rather succeed in doing what we can than fail to do what we
can't."
     fiver gave no sign of having heard him. he seemed to be lost in his own
thoughts. when he spoke again, it was as though he were talking to himself.
"there's a thick mist between the hills and us. i can't see through it, but through
it we sha

there are too few of us for giving orders and biting people. frith in a fog! isn't
there enough trouble and danger already?"
     they went over to the far end of the pit. bigwig and silver were talking with
buckthorn under an overhanging broom. nearby, pipkin and dandelion were
pretending to feed on a patch of scrub. some way away, acorn was making a great

business of licking hawkbit's throat, while speedwell watched.
     "keep still if you can, poor old chap," said acorn, who obviously wanted to be
overheard. "just let me clean the blood out. steady, now!" hawkbit winced in an
exaggerated manner and backed away. as hazel came up, all the rabbits turned
and stared at him expectantly.

eal or imagined. it was so dark that hazel
seldom knew for certain whether he was leading or whether bigwig or silver
might not be ahead. once, hearing an unaccountable noise in front of him, which
ceased on the instant, he kept still for a long time; and when at last he moved
cautiously forward, found silver crouching behind a tussock of cocksfoot for fear
of the sound of his own approach. all was confusion, ignorance, clambering and
exhaustion. throughout the bad dream of the night's journey, pipkin seemed to
be always close beside him. though each of the others vanished and reappeared
like fragments floating round a pool, pipkin never left him; and his need for
encouragement became at last hazel's only support against his own weariness.
     "not far now, hlao-roo, not far now," he kept muttering, until he realized that
what he said had become meaningless, a mere refrain. he was not speaking to
pipkin or even to himself. he was talking in his sleep, or something very near it.

at the far end of an unknown burrow; and in the same moment a yellowhammer
sang. hazel's feelings were like those which might pass through the mind of a
defeated general. where were his followers exactly? he hoped, not far away. but
were they? all of them? where had he led them? what was he going to do now?
what if an enemy appeared at this moment? he had answers to none of these
questions and no spirit left to force himself to think about them. behind him,
pipkin shivered in the damp, and he turned and nuzzled him -- much as the
general, with nothing left to do, might fall to considering the welfare of his
servant, simply because the servant happened to be there.
     the light grew stronger and soon he could see that a little way ahead there was
an open track of bare gravel. he limped out of the heather, sat on the stones and

shook the wet from his fur. he could see fiver's hills plainly now, greenish-gray
and seeming close in the rain-laden air. he

de a tussock of grass a little way outside the opposite copse, a rabbit was
sitting and gazing at them. its ears were erect and it was evidently giving them the
full attention of sight, smell and hearing. hazel rose on his hind legs, paused, and
then sat back on his haunches, in full view. the other rabbit remained motionless.
hazel, never taking his eyes off it, heard three or four of the others coming up
behind him. after a moment he said,
     "blackberry?"
     "he's down the hole," replied pipkin.
     "go and get him."
     still the strange rabbit made no move. the wind rose and the long grass began
to flutter and ripple in the dip between them. from behind, blackberry said,
     "you wanted me, hazel?"
     "i'm going over to speak to that rabbit," said hazel. "i want you to come with
me."
     "can i come?" asked pipkin.
     "no, hlao-roo. we don't want to frighten him. three's too many."

enough rank-and-filers as long as they were not pushed beyond their limits. last

from the hole, the clouds in the west broke slightly and there was a sudden dazzle
of watery, pale gold light.

come to see them unattended -- in his burrow, after which they would all be given
different places to go to. it was this separation of which he had been afraid. he
now realized with astonishment that there was apparently a part of the warren
underground which was big enough to contain them all together. he felt so
curious to visit it that he did not stop to make any detailed arrangements about
the order in which they should go down. however, he put pipkin immediately
behind him. "it'll warm his little heart for once," he thought, "and if the leaders
do get attacked, i suppose we can spare him easier than some." bigwig he asked
to bring up the rear. "if there's any trouble, get out of it," he said, "and take as
many as you can with you." then he followed their guides into one of the holes in
the bank.

there was a good deal of air ahead of him -- he could feel it moving -- and there
was a considerable space above his head. also, there were several rabbits near
him. it had not occurred to him that there would be a place underground where
he would be exposed on three sides. he backed quickly and felt pipkin at his tail.
"what a fool i was!" he thought. "why didn't i put silver there?" at this moment
he heard cowslip speaking. he jumped, for he could tell that he was some way
away. the size of the place must be immense.
     "is that you, hazel?" said cowslip. "you're welcome, and so are your friends.
we're glad you've come."
     no human beings, except the courageous and experienced blind, are able to
sense much in a strange place where they cannot see, but with rabbits it is
otherwise. they spen

which gradually alters one way or the other until it is clear that the balance has
tilted so far that the issue can no longer be in doubt -- so this gathering of rabbits
in the dark, beginning with hesitant approaches, silences, pauses, movements,
crouchings side by side and all manner of tentative appraisals, slowly moved, like
a hemisphere of the world into summer, to a warmer, brighter region of mutual
liking and approval, until all felt sure that they had nothing to fear. pipkin, some
way away from hazel, crouched at his ease between two huge rabbits who could
have broken his back in a second, while buckthorn and cowslip started a playful
scuffle, nipping each other like kittens and then breaking off to comb their ears in
a comical pretense of sudden gravity. only fiver sat alone and apart. he seemed
either ill or very much depressed, and the strangers avoided him instinctively.
     the knowledge that the gathering was safely round the corner came to hazel in

n of laughter is unknown to animals; though it is possible that
dogs and elephants may have some inkling of it. the effect on hazel and
blackberry was overwhelming. hazel's first idea was that cowslip was showing
the symptom of some kind of disease. blackberry clearly thought that he might be
going to attack them and backed away. cowslip said nothing, but his eerie
laughter continued. hazel and blackberry turned and scuttled up the nearest run
as though he had been a ferret. halfway up they met pipkin, who was small
enough first to let them pass and then to turn round and follow them.
     the rain was still falling steadily. the night was dark and, for may, cold. they
all three hunched themselves in the grass and nibbled while the rain ran off their
fur in streams.
     "my goodness, hazel," said blackberry, "did you really want to silflay? this is
terrible! i was just going to eat whatever it is they have and then go to sleep.
what's the idea?"
     "i don't know," replied hazel. "i sudden

  hazel explained. blackberry was as much at a loss as he had been himself. "but
i'll tell you another thing," he said. "bigwig wasn't so far wrong. they do sing like
the birds. i was in a burrow belonging to a rabbit called betony. his doe has a
litter and she was making a noise over them rather like a robin in autumn. to
send them to sleep, she said. it made me feel queer, i can tell you."
     "and what do you think of them, hlao-roo?" asked hazel.
     "they're very nice and kind," answered pipkin, "but i'll tell you how they strike
me. they all seem terribly sad. i can't think why, when they're so big and strong
and have this beautiful warren. but they put me in mind of trees in november. i

expect i'm being silly, though, hazel. you brought us here and i'm sure it must be
a fine, safe place."
     "no, you're not being silly. i hadn't realized it, but you're perfectly right. they
all seem to have something on their minds."
     "but after all," said blackberry, "we don't know why they

're so few. they don't
fill the warren, anything like. perhaps they've had some sort of trouble that's left
them sad."
     "we don't know because they don't tell us. but if we're going to stay here we've
got to learn to get on with them. we can't fight them: they're too big. and we
don't want them fighting us."
     "i don't believe they can fight, hazel," said pipkin. "although they're so big,
they don't seem like fighters to me. not like bigwig and silver."
     "you notice a lot, don't you, hlao-roo?" said hazel. "do you notice it's raining
harder than ever? i've got enough grass in my stomach for a bit. we'll go down
again now, but let's keep to ourselves for a while."
     "why not sleep?" said blackberry. "it's over a night and a day now and i'm
dropping."
     they returned down a different hole and soon found a dry, empty burrow,
where they curled up

   hazel lay in the warm, dark burrow with a delightful sense of security. he
could smell the man. the man could not smell him. all the man could smell was
the nasty smoke he was making. he fell to thinking of the shape in the well pit,
and then dropped into a drowsy half-dream, in which el-ahrairah said that it was
all a trick of his to disguise himself as poison tree and put the stones in the wall,
to engage strawberry's attention while he himself was getting acquainted with
nildro-hain.
     pipkin stirred and turned in his sleep, murmuring, "sayn lay narn, marli?" ("is
groundsel nice, mother?") and hazel, touched to think that he must be dreaming
of old days, rolled over on his side to give him room to settle again. at that
moment, however, he heard a rabbit approaching down some run close by.
whoever it was, he was calling -- and stamping as well, hazel noticed -- in an
unnatural way. the sound, as blackberry had said, was not unlike birdsong. as he
came closer, hazel could distinguish

the word.
     "flayrah! flayrah!"
     the voice was strawberry's. pipkin and blackberry were waking, more at the
stamping than the voice, which was thin and novel, not striking through their
sleep to any deep instinct. hazel slipped out of the burrow into the run and at
once came upon strawberry busily thumping a hind leg on the hard earth floor.

     "my mother used to say, 'if you were a horse the ceiling would fall down,'" said
hazel. "why do you stamp underground?"
     "to wake everyone," answered strawberry. "the rain went on nearly all night,

ated roots filling him with a
wave of pleasure. he hopped about the grass, gnawing one piece after another,
eating the green tops along with the slices. no one interrupted him. there seemed
to be plenty for all. from time to time, instinctively, he looked up and sniffed the
wind, but his caution was half-hearted. "if elil come, let them," he thought. "i'll
fight the lot. i couldn't run, anyway. what a country! what a warren! no wonder
they're all as big as hares and smell like princes!" "hello, pipkin! fill yourself up
to the ears! no more shivering on the banks of streams for you, old chap!"
     "he won't know how to shiver in a week or two," said hawkbit, with his mouth
full. "i feel so much better for this! i'd follow you anywhere, hazel. i wasn't
myself in the heather that night. it's bad when you know you can't get
underground. i hope you understand."

supposed to do about taking some of this stuff back to the

it, like a dog, across the field and back to the warren. he had to put it down
several times. but cowslip was encouraging and he was determined to keep up
his position as the resourceful leader of the newcomers. at his suggestion they
both waited at the mouth of one of the larger holes to see how his companions
were shaping. they all seemed to be making an effort and doing their best,
although the smaller rabbits -- especially pipkin -- clearly found the task an
awkward one.
     "cheer up, pipkin," said hazel. "think how much you'll enjoy eating it tonight.
anyway, i'm sure fiver must find it as hard as you: he's just as small."
     "i don't know where he is," said pipkin. "have you seen him?"
     now that hazel thought about it, he had not. he became a little anxious and,
as he returned across the field with cowslip, did his best to explain something of
fiver's peculiar temperament. "i do hope he's all right," he said.

     "i wouldn't be surprised," said hazel. "it would be just like them. let's ask
cowslip."
     "that's the only silly thing you've said so far. tell me, since we came here has
cowslip answered any question you've asked him?"
     "well, no -- not many."
     "try asking him where he dances in the moonlight. say 'cowslip, where--'"
     "oh, you've noticed that, too, have you? he won't answer 'where' anything.

     "there's more rain coming tonight," said bigwig. "soon, too, i think. let's go
underground and see if we can get them to talk a bit more freely."

     hazel turned his head and looked down the course of the brook. far away,
between the two copses, he could see the cherry tree where two days before he
had sat with blackberry and fiver in the sunrise. he remembered how bigwig had
chased hawkbit through the long grass, forgetting the quarrel of the previous
night in the joy of their arrival. he could see hawkbit running toward him now
and two or three of the others -- silver, dandelion and pipkin. dandelion, well in
front, dashed up to the gap and checked, twitching and staring.
     "what is it, hazel? what's happened? fiver said--"
     "bigwig's in a wire. let him alone till blackberry tells us. stop the others
crowding round."
     dandelion turned and raced back as pipkin came up.
     "is cowslip coming?" said hazel. "perhaps he knows--"
     "he wouldn't come," replied pipkin. "he told fiver to stop talking about it."
     "told him what?" asked hazel incredulously. but at that m

 to stop, panting. silver took his place, and was
followed by buckthorn. the nasty, smooth, clean, man-smelling peg was laid bare
to the length of a rabbit's ear, but still it did not come loose. bigwig had not
moved. he lay across the wire, torn and bloody, with closed eyes. buckthorn drew
his head and paws out of the hole and rubbed the mud off his face.
     "the peg's narrower down there," he said. "it tapers. i think it could be bitten
through, but i can't get my teeth to it."

     "send pipkin in," said blackberry. "he's smaller."
     pipkin plunged into the hole. they could hear the wood splintering under his
teeth -- a sound like a mouse in a shed wainscot at midnight. he came out with
his nose bleeding.
     "the splinters prick you and it's hard to breathe, but the peg's nearly through."
     "fiver, go in," said hazel.
     fiver was not long in the hole. he, too, came out bleeding.
     "it's broken in two. it's free."
     blackberry pressed his nose against bigwig's head. as

quoting a rabbit proverb.
     "if only it were not bigwig," said blackberry. "what shall we do without him?"
     "the others are waiting," said hazel. "we have to stay alive. there has to be
something for them to think about. help me, or it will be more than i can do."
     he turned away from the body and looked for fiver among the rabbits behind
him. but fiver was nowhere to be seen and hazel was afraid to ask for him, in
case to do so should seem like weakness and a need for comfort.
     "pipkin," he snapped, "why don't you clean up your face and stop the bleeding?
the smell of blood attracts elil. you know that, don't you?"
     "yes, hazel. i'm sorry. will bigwig--"
     "and another thing," said hazel desperately. "what was it you were telling me
about cowslip? did you say he told fiver to be quiet?"
     "yes, hazel. fiver came into the warren and told us about the snare, and that
poor bigwig--"
     "yes, all right. and then cowslip--?"

ad been a grim shock. they had
come closer together, relying on and valuing each other's capacities. they knew
now that it was on these and on nothing else that their lives depended, and they
were not going to waste anything they possessed between them. in spite of
hazel's efforts beside the snare, there was not one of them who had not turned
sick at heart to think that bigwig was dead and wondered, like blackberry, what
would become of them now. without hazel, without blackberry, buckthorn and
pipkin -- bigwig would have died. without himself he would have died, for which
else, of them all, would not have stopped running after such punishment? there
was no more questioning of bigwig's strength, fiver's insight, blackberry's wits or
hazel's authority. when the rats came, buckthorn and silver had obeyed bigwig
and stood their ground. the rest had followed hazel when he roused them and,
without explanation, told them to go quickly outside the barn. later, hazel had
said that there was nothing

off. people who record birdsong generally do it very early --
before six o'clock -- if they can. soon after that, the invasion of distant noise in
most woodland becomes too constant and too loud. during the last fifty years the
silence of much of the country has been destroyed. but here, on watership down,
there floated up only faint traces of the daylight noise below.
     the sun was well up, though not yet as high as the down, when hazel woke.
with him in the burrow were buckthorn, fiver and pipkin. he was nearest to the
mouth of the hole and did not wake them as he slipped up the run. outside, he
stopped to pass hraka and then hopped through the thorn patch to the open
grass. below, the country was covered with early-morning mist which was
beginning to clear. here and there, far off, were the shapes of trees and roofs,
from which streamers of mist trailed down like broken waves pouring from rocks.
the sky was cloudless and deep blue, darkening to mauve along the whole rim of
the horizon.

     moving uncertainly in and out along the edge of the hanger, they came to the
northeast corner. here there was a bank from which they looked out over the
empty stretches of grass beyond. fiver, absurdly small beside the hulking bigwig,
turned to hazel with an air of happy confidence.
     "i'm sure blackberry's right, hazel," he said. "we ought to do our best to make
some holes here. i'm ready to try, anyway."
     the others were taken aback. pipkin, however, readily joined hazel at the foot
of the bank and soon two or three more began scratching at the light soil. the
digging was easy and although they often broke off to feed or merely to sit in the
sun, before midday hazel was out of sight and tunneling between the tree roots.
     the hanger might have little or no undergrowth but at least the branches gave
cover from the sky: and kestrels, they soon realized, were common in this
solitude. although kestrels seldom prey on anything bigge

     it took a long time to climb the hill. hazel made them separate, himself
remaining with holly and bluebell while bigwig and dandelion went out to either
side. holly was forced to stop several times and hazel, full of fear, had hard work
to suppress his impatience. only when the moon began to rise -- the edge of its
great disc growing brighter and brighter on the skyline below and behind them --
did he at last beg holly to hurry. as he spoke he saw, in the white light, pipkin
coming down to meet them.
     "what are you doing?" he said sternly. "i told speedwell no one was to come
down."
     "it isn't speedwell's fault," said pipkin. "you stood by me at the river, so i
thought i'd come and look for you, hazel. anyway, the holes are just here. is it
really captain holly you've found?"
     bigwig and dandelion approached.
     "i'll tell you what," said bigwig. "these two will need to rest for a good long
time. suppose pipkin here and dandelion take them to an empty

     "i say, what's happened, hazel?" asked silver. "it must be something very bad.
holly would never leave the threarah."
     "i don't know," replied hazel, "and neither does anyone else yet. we'll have to
wait until tomorow. holly may stop running, but i don't think bluebell will. now
let me alone to do this leg of buckthorn's."
     the wound was a great deal better and soon hazel fell asleep.
     the next day was as hot and cloudless as the last. neither pipkin nor
dandelion was at morning silflay; and hazel relentlessly took the others up to the
beech hanger to go on with the digging. he questioned strawberry about the great
burrow and learned that its ceiling, as well as being vaulted with a tangle of
fibers, was strengthened by roots going vertically down into the floor. he
remarked that he had not noticed these.
     "there aren't many, but they're important," said strawberry. "they take a lot of
the load. if it weren't for those roots the ceiling

     "perhaps hawk not gone," he said. "you stay now. go later."
     bigwig was about to speak again when dandelion appeared in the mouth of the
hole. he looked at the mouse, pushed it gently aside and came down the run.
     "hazel," he said, "i thought i ought to come and tell you about holly. he's
much better this evening, but he had a very bad night and so did we. every time
he seemed to be going to sleep, he kept starting up and crying. i thought he was
going out of his mind. pipkin kept talking to him -- he was first-rate -- and he
seems to set a lot of store by bluebell. bluebell kept on making jokes. he was
worn out before the morning and so were the lot of us -- we've been sleeping all
day. holly's been more or less himself since he woke up this afternoon, and he's
been up to silflay. he asked where you and the others would be tonight and, as i
didn't know, i came to ask."
     "is he fit to talk to us, then?" asked bigwig.
     "i think so. it would be the best thing

e others feel."
     "what's this mouse doing in here?" asked dandelion.
     hazel explained. dandelion was as puzzled as bigwig had been.
     "well, i'll admit i hadn't any particular idea when i went out to help it," said
hazel. "i have now, though, and i'll explain later what it is. but, first of all, bigwig
and i ought to go and talk to holly. and, dandelion, you go and tell the rest what
you told me, will you, and see what they want to do tonight?"
     they found holly with bluebell and pipkin, on the turf by the anthill where
dandelion had first looked over the down. holly was sniffing at a purple orchis.
the head of mauve blooms rocked gently on its stem as he pushed his nose
against it.
     "don't frighten it, master," said bluebell. "it might fly away. after all, it's got a
lot of spots to choose from. look at them all over the leaves."
     "oh, get along with you, bluebell," answered holly, good-humoredly. "we
need to learn about the ground here. half the plants are strange to

could find. every hole he came to, he cut out the turf above and pushed it into the
hole. that puzzled me, because with ferrets they want to drive the rabbits out. but
i was expecting that they'd leave a few holes open and net them: although that
would have been a foolish way to ferret, because a rabbit that went up a blocked
run would be killed underground and then the man wouldn't get his ferret back
very easily, you know."
     "don't make it too grim, holly," said hazel, for pipkin was shuddering at the
thought of the blocked run and the pursuing ferret.
     "too grim?" replied holly bitterly. "i've hardly started yet. would anyone like
to go away?" no one moved and after a few moments he continued.

     "then another of the men fetched some long, thin, bending things. i haven't
got words for all these men things, but they were something like lengths of very

hardly a full day had elapsed since holly had come crawling in delirium to the
foot of watership down. yet already he was near recovery, while the more light-
hearted bluebell seemed even less the worse for the dreadful catastrophe that he
had survived. hazel and his companions had suffered extremes of grief and
horror during the telling of holly's tale. pipkin had cried and trembled piteously
at the death of scabious, and acorn and speedwell had been seized with
convulsive choking as bluebell told of the poisonous gas that murdered
underground. yet, as with primitive humans, the very strength and vividness of
their sympathy brought with it a true release. their feelings were not false or
assumed. while the story was being told, they heard it without any of the reserve

everyone and was seen as something that not even blackberry could have hit
upon. reconnaissance is familiar to all rabbits -- indeed, it is second nature -- but
the idea of making use of a bird, and one so strange and savage, convinced them
that hazel, if he could really do it, must be as clever as el-ahrairah himself.
     for the next few days a lot of hard work went into feeding kehaar. acorn and
pipkin, boasting that they were the best insect-catchers in the warren, brought in
great numbers of beetles and grasshoppers. at first the gull's principal hardship
was lack of water. he suffered a good deal and was reduced to tearing at the
stems of the long grasses for moisture. however, during his third night in the
warren it rained for three or four hours and puddles formed on the track. a
cluttery spell set in, as it often does in hampshire when haytime approaches.

nothing more than that. i'm not going to take any risks -- well, not real risks --
not until i see whether it's worth it, anyway."
     should he go alone? it would be safer and more pleasant to take a companion;
but not more than one. they must not attract attention. who would be best?
bigwig? dandelion? hazel rejected them. he needed someone who would do as
he was told and not start having ideas of his own. at once he thought of pipkin.
pipkin would follow him without question and do anything he asked. at this
moment he was probably asleep in the burrow which he shared with bluebell and
acorn, down a short run leading off the honeycomb.
     hazel was lucky. he found pipkin close to the mouth of the burrow and already
awake. he brought him out without disturbing the other two rabbits and led him
up by the run that gave on the bank. pipkin looked about him uncertainly,
bewildered and half expecting some danger.

you to come down the hill and help me to find a farm i've heard about. we're just

     "round a farm, hazel-rah? what for? won't it be dangerous? cats and dogs
and--"
     "no, you'll be quite all right with me. just you and me -- i don't want anyone
else. i've got a secret plan; you mustn't tell the others -- for the time being,
anyway. i particularly want you to come and no one else will do."
     this had exactly the effect that hazel intended. pipkin needed no further
persuasion and they set off together, over the grass track, across the turf beyond
and down the escarpment. they went through the narrow belt of trees and came
into the field where holly had called bigwig in the dark. here hazel paused,
sniffing and listening. it was the time before dawn when owls return, usually
hunting as they go. although a full-grown rabbit is not really in danger from owls,
there are few who take no account of them. stoats and foxes might be abroad
also,

but the night was still and damp and hazel, secure in his mood of gay
confidence, felt sure that he would either smell or hear any hunter on four feet.
     wherever the farm might be, it must lie beyond the road that ran along the
opposite edge of the field. he set off at an easy pace, with pipkin close behind.

ng in miraculous, buoyant water. hazel had this feeling
now. all round him was the quiet summer night, luminous with starlight but
paling to dawn on one side. there was nothing to fear and he felt ready to skip
through a thousand farmyards one after the other. as he sat with pipkin on the
bank above the tar-smelling road, it did not strike him as particularly lucky when
he saw a young rat scuttle across from the opposite hedge and disappear into a
clump of fading stitchwort below them. he had known that some guide or other
would turn up. he scrambled quickly down the bank and found the rat nosing in
the ditch.
     "the farm," said hazel, "where's the farm -- near here, on a little hill?"
     the rat stared at him with twitching whiskers. it had no particular reason to b

friendly, but there was something in hazel's look that made a civil answer
natural.
     "over road. up lane."
     the sky was growing lighter each moment. hazel crossed the road without
waiting for pipkin, who caught him up under the hedge bordering the near side of
the little lane. from here, after another listening pause, they began to make their
way up the slope toward the northern skyline.
     nuthanger is like a farm in an old tale. between ecchinswell and the foot of
watership down and about half a mile from each, there is a broad knoll, steeper
on the north side but falling gently on the south -- like the down ridge itself.
narrow lanes climb both slopes and come together in a great ring

 elm trees
which encircles the flat summit. any wind -- even the lightest -- draws from the
height of the elms a rushing sound, multifoliate and powerful. within this ring
stands the farmhouse, with its barns and outbuildings. the house may be two
hundred years old or it may be older, built of brick, with a stone-faced front
looking south toward the down. on the east side, in front of the house, a barn
stands clear of the ground on staddle stones; and opposite is the cow byre.
     as hazel and pipkin reached the top of the slope, the first light showed clearly
the farmyard and buildings. the birds singing all about them were those to which
they had been accustomed in former days. a robin on a low branch twittered a
phrase and listened for another that answered him from beyond the farmhouse. a
chaffinch gave its little falling song and further off, high in an elm, a chiffchaff
began to call. hazel stopped and then sat up, the better to scent the air. powerful
smells of straw and cow dung min

ear. tobacco, naturally: a good deal of cat and rather less dog and then, suddenly
and beyond doubt, rabbit. he looked at pipkin and saw that he, too, had caught it.
     while these scents reached them they were also listening. but beyond the light
movements of birds and the first buzzing of the flies immediately around them,
they could hear nothing but the continual susurration of the trees. under the
northern steep of the down the air had been still, but here the southerly breeze

was magnified by the elms, with their myriads of small, fluttering leaves, just as
the effect of sunlight on a garden is magnified by dew.

 the sound, coming from
the topmost branches, disturbed hazel because it suggested some huge approach
-- an approach that was never completed: and he and pipkin remained still for
some time, listening tensely to this loud yet meaningless vehemence high
overhead.
     they saw no cat, but near the house stood a flat-roofed dog kennel. they could
just glimpse the dog asleep inside -- a large, smooth-haired, black dog, with head
on paws. hazel could not see a chain; but then, after a moment, he noticed the
line of a thin rope that came out through the kennel door and ended in some sort
of fastening on the roof. "why a rope?" he wondered and then thought,

pposite the door, on a
broad wooden shelf -- a kind of platform -- stood a wire-fronted hutch. through
the mesh he could see a brown bowl, some greenstuff and the ears of two or three
rabbits. as he stared, one of the rabbits came close to the wire, looked out and
saw him.
     beside the platform, on the near side, was an up-ended bale of straw. hazel
jumped lightly on it and from there to the thick planks, which were old and soft-
surfaced, dusty and covered with chaff. then he turned back to pipkin, waiting
just inside the door.
     "hlao-roo," he said, "there's only one way out of this place. you'll have to keep
watching for cats or we may be trapped. stay at the door and if you see a cat
outside, tell me at once."
     "right, hazel-rah," said pipkin. "it's all clear at the moment."
     hazel went up to the side of the hutch. the wired front projected over the edge
of the shelf so that he could neither reach it nor look in, but there was a knothole
in one of the boards facing him and

ven to find a meal. if he was going to get any of
them as far as the down, they would have to be urged. he sat quiet for a little,
nibbling a patch of bran spilled on the boards outside the hutch. then he said,
     "i must go back now to my friends in the hills: but we shall return. we shall
come one night, and when we do, believe me, we shall open your hutch as easily
as the farmer does: and then, any of you who wish will be free to come with us."
     boxwood was about to reply when suddenly pipkin spoke from the floor.
"hazel, there's a cat in the yard outside!"
     "we're not afraid of cats," said hazel to boxwood, "as long as we're in the
open." trying to appear unhurried, he went back to the floor by way of the straw
bale and crossed over to the door. pipkin was looking through the hinge. he was
plainly frightened.
     "i think it's smelled us, hazel," he said. "i'm afraid it knows where we are."
     "don't stay there, then," said hazel. "follow me close and run when i do."

already sunlight was slanting across the yard, and in the stillness the flies buzzed
about a patch of dung a few feet away. there was a smell of straw and dust and
hawthorn.
     "you look hungry," said hazel to the cat. "rats getting too clever, i suppose?"
     the cat made no reply. hazel sat blinking in the sunshine. the cat crouched
almost flat on the ground, thrusting its head forward between its front paws.

close behind, pipkin fidgeted and hazel, never taking his eyes from the cat, could
sense that he was trembling.
     "don't be frightened, hlao-roo," he whispered, "i'll get you away, but you must
wait till it comes for us. keep still."
     the cat began to lash its tail. its hindquarters lifted and wagged from side to
side in mounting excitement.
     "can you run?" said hazel. "i think not. why, you pop-eyed, back-door saucer-
scraper--"
     the cat flung itself across the yard and the two rabbits leaped into f

the rabbits in the box?"

can make our way home as slowly as you like."

him, "it is time to make the offering."

     as things turned out, hazel and pipkin did not come back to the honeycomb
until the evening. they were still feeding in the field when it came on to rain, with
a cold wind, and they took shelter first in the nearby ditch and then -- since the
ditch was on a slope and had a fair flow of rainwater in about ten minutes --
among some sheds halfway down the lane. they burrowed into a thick pile of
straw and for some time remained listening for rats. but all was quiet and they
grew drowsy and fell asleep, while outside the rain settled in

and
anyway no self-respecting rabbit could leave without a forage round the sheds. a
pile of mangels and swedes occupied them for some time and they set out only
when the light was beginning to fade. they took their time and reached the
hanger a little before dark, with nothing worse to trouble them than the
discomfort of soaking-wet fur. only two or three of the rabbits were out to a
rather subdued silflay in the wet. no one remarked on their absence and hazel
went underground at once, telling pipkin to say nothing about their adventure for

the time being. he found his burrow empty, lay down and fell asleep.
     waking, he found fiver beside him as usual. it was some time before dawn.
the earth floor felt pleasantly dry and snug and he was about to go back to sleep
when fiver spoke.
     "you've been wet through, hazel."
     "well, what about it? the grass is wet, you know."
     "you didn't get so wet on silflay. you were soaked. you weren't here at all

warren early yesterday evening. kehaar told us. do you mean to say you didn't
know?"
     hazel felt fairly caught out. "well, i know now," he replied. "i'm glad to hear
it."
     "so it comes to this," said fiver. "you went to a farm yesterday and escaped
from a cat. and whatever you were up to, it was so much on your mind that you
forgot to ask about holly last night."
     "well, all right, fiver -- i'll tell you all about it. i took pipkin and went to that
farm that kehaar told us about where there are rabbits in a hutch. i found the
rabbits and talked to them and i've taken a notion to go back one night and get
them out, to come and join us here."
     "what for?"
     "well, two of them are does, that's what for."
     "but if holly's successful we shall soon have plenty of does: and from all i've
ever heard of hutch rabbits, they don't take easily to wild life. the truth is, you're
just a silly show-off."

     "risking your life and other rabbits' lives for something that's of little or no
value to us," said fiver. "oh, yes, of course the others will go with you. you're
their chief rabbit. you're supposed to decide what's sensible and they trust you.
persuading them will prove nothing, but three or four dead rabbits will prove
you're a fool, when it's too late."
     "oh, be quiet," answered hazel. "i'm going to sleep."
     during silflay next morning, with pipkin for a respectful chorus, he told the
others about his visit to the farm. as he had expected, bigwig jumped at the idea
of a raid to free the hutch rabbits.
     "it can't go wrong," he said. "it's a splendid idea, hazel! i don't know how you
open a hutch, but blackberry will see to that. what annoys me is to think you ran
from that cat. a good rabbit's a match for a cat, any day. my mother went for one

ned the others in the honeycomb. they had persuaded
kehaar to come down out of the wind and wet, and one of dandelion's tales of el-
ahrairah was followed by an extraordinary story that left everyone mystified but
fascinated, about a time when frith had to go away on a journey, leaving the
whole world to be covered with rain. but a man built a great floating hutch that
held all the animals and birds until frith returned and let them out.
     "it won't happen tonight, will it, hazel-rah?" asked pipkin, listening to the rain
in the beech leaves outside. "there's no hutch here."
     "kehaar'll fly you up to the moon, hlao-roo," said bluebell, "and you can come
down on bigwig's head like a birch branch in the frost. but there's time to go to
sleep first."
     before fiver slept, however, he talked again to hazel about the raid.
     "i suppose it's no good asking you not to go?" he said.
     "look here," answered hazel, "have you got one of your bad turns about the
farm? if you have, why not

     "if it comes to the worst," said bigwig, "we can leave the hutch rabbits and bolt.
elil take the hindmost, don't they? i know it's tough, but if there's real trouble we
ought to save our own rabbits first. let's hope that doesn't happen, though."
     when they came to set out, fiver was nowhere to be seen. hazel felt relieved,
for he had been afraid that fiver might say something that would lower their

spirits. but there was nothing worse to contend with than pipkin's
disappointment at being left behind; and this was dispelled when hazel assured
him that the only reason was that he had already done his bit. bluebell, acorn and
pipkin came with them to the foot of the hill and watched them down the
hedgerow.
     they reached the sheds in the twilight after sunset the summer nightfall was
unbroken by owls and so quiet that they could plainly hear the intermittent,
monotonous "chug chug chug" of a nightingale in the distant woods. two rats

n to cool, the rabbits woke and first one and
then another came down the runs that led from the smaller burrows. all were
subdued and doubtful at heart. like the pain of a bad wound, the effect of a deep
shock takes some while to be felt. when a child is told, for the first time in his life,
that a person he has known is dead, although he does not disbelieve it, he may
well fail to comprehend it and later ask -- perhaps more than once -- where the
dead person is and when he is coming back. when pipkin had planted in himself,
like some somber tree, the knowledge that hazel would never return, his
bewilderment exceeded his grief: and this bewilderment he saw on every side
among his companions. faced with no crisis of action and with nothing to
prevent them from continuing their life in the warren as before, the rabbits were
nevertheless overcome by the conviction that their luck was gone. hazel was dead
and holly's expedition had totally failed. what would follow?

her than he had himself. as for hazel, he had acquired, in everyone's eyes, a
kind of magical quality. of all the warren, dandelion was the last rabbit to fail to
do justice to a good story and he had made the most of hazel's heroic dash out of
the ditch to save his friends from the farmers. no one had even suggested that
hazel might have been reckless in going to the farm. against all odds he had got
them two does: and now he was bringing their luck back to the warren.
     just before sunrise pipkin and speedwell saw fiver coming through the wet
grass near the summit of the down. they ran out to meet him and waited with
him until hazel came up to them. hazel was limping and had evidently found the
climb a strain, but after resting and feeding for a short time he was able to run
down to the warren almost as fast as the others. the rabbits crowded round.

     "are you going to need many rabbits, hazel-rah?" asked dandelion. "from all i
hear, the whole lot of us wouldn't be enough to fight the efrafans."
     "i hope we shan't have to fight at all," replied hazel, "but there's always the
possibility. anyway, it'll be a long journey home with the does, and if by any
chance we meet a wide patrol on the way, there have got to be enough of us to
deal with them."
     "would we have to go into efrafa?" asked pipkin timidly.
     "no," said hazel, "we shall--"
     "i never thought, hazel," interrupted holly, "i never thought that the time
would come when i should feel obliged to speak against you. but i can only say
again that this is likely to be a complete disaster. i know what you think -- you're
counting on general woundwort not having anyone as clever as blackberry and
fiver. you're quite right -- i don't think he has. but the fact remains that no one
can get a bunch of does away from that place. you

here are some of us who ought to stay here," said hazel. "the farm
rabbits can't be expected to go; and i'm not asking anyone who went the first time
to go back again."
     "i'll come, though," said silver. "i hate general woundwort and his council
with all my guts and if we're really going to make fools of them i want to be there,
as long as i don't have to go back inside the place -- that i couldn't face. but, after
all, you're going to need someone who knows the way."
     "i'll come," said pipkin. "hazel-rah saved my -- i mean, i'm sure he knows
what's--" he became confused. "anyway, i'll come," he repeated, in a very
nervous voice.
     there was a scuffling in the run that led down from the wood and hazel called,
"who's that?"
     "it's i, hazel-rah -- blackberry."
     "blackberry!" said hazel. "why, i thought you'd been here all the time. where
have you been?"
     "sorry not to have come before," said blackberry. i've been talking to kehaar,
as a matter of fact, about the plan. he

light green sun-and-shade of the thorn thicket
     "is bigwig there?" asked hazel.
     throughout the morning bigwig had seemed unlike himself -- silent and
preoccupied, with little attention for what was going on around him. if his
courage had not been beyond question, it might have been thought that he was
feeling nervous. during one long halt bluebell had overheard him talking with
hazel, fiver and blackberry, and later had told pipkin that it sounded for all the
world as though bigwig were being reassured. "fighting, yes, anywhere," he had
heard him say, "but i still reckon that this game is more in someone else's line
than mine." "no," replied hazel, "you're the only one that can do it: and
remember, this isn't sport, if the farm raid was. everything depends on it." then,
realizing that bluebell could hear him, he added, "anyway, keep on thinking

about it and try to get used to the idea. we must get on now." bigwig had go

ey were on edge, and after parrying one or two
questions about the plan, he began to wonder how he could distract their
thoughts and get them to relax until they were ready to set off again. he
remembered the time, on the first night of his leadership, when they had been
forced to rest in the wood above the enborne. at least it was good to see that no
one was exhausted now: they were as tough a bunch of hlessil as ever raided a
garden. not a blade of grass to choose between them, thought hazel: pipkin and
fiver looked as fresh as silver and bigwig. still, a little entertainment would be all
to the good and raise their spirits. he was just going to speak up when acorn
saved him the trouble.
     "will you tell us a story, dandelion?" he asked.
     "yes! yes!" said several others. "come on! make it a stunner while you're at it!"
     "all right," said dandelion. "how about 'el-ahrairah and the fox in the
water'?"
     "let's have 'the hole in the sky,'" said hawkbit.
     "no, not that," said

 as they went, it overhung them until it made a dark
roof above their backs. where the cliff ended was the mouth of a tunnel, like a
huge rabbit hole. in the freezing cold and silence, el-ahrairah stamped and
flashed his tail to rabscuttle. and then, as they were about to go into the tunnel,
they realized that what they had thought, in the gloom, to be a part of the rock
was not rock. it was the black rabbit of inlé, close beside them, still as lichen and
cold as the stone."
     "hazel," said pipkin, staring into the dusk and trembling, "i don't like this
story. i know i'm not brave--"
     "it's all right, hlao-roo," said fiver, "you're not the only one." in fact he
himself seemed composed and even detached, which was more than could be said
for any other rabbit in the audience: but pipkin was hardly to realize this. "let's
go out there for a bit and watch the spiders catching moths, shall we?" said fiver.
"i think i can remember where i left a patch of vetch -- it must be somewhere this

way." still talking quietly, he led pipkin out into the overgrown combe. hazel
turned to make sure of the direction they had taken and as he did so dandelion
hesitated, uncertain whether to resume.
     "go on," said bigwig, "and don't leave anything out."

     "i think many things are left out, if only the truth could be known," said
dandelion, "for no one can say what happens in that country where el-ahrairah
went of his own accord and we do not. but, as i was told, when they first became
aware of the black rabbit, they fled down th

     "hazel! hazel-rah!" it was pipkin's voice from behind a clump of burdock on
the edge of the little circle of listeners. "there's a fox coming up the combe!"

     *bob-stones is a traditional game of rabbits. it is played with small stones,
fragments of sticks or the like. fundamentally it is a very simple kind of
gambling, on the lines of "odds or evens." a "cast" of stones on the ground is

story had ever seen a fox. nevertheless, they knew that a fox in the open, plain to
be seen, is not dangerous as long as it is spotted in time. hazel realized that he

had been careless to allow everyone to gather round dandelion and to have failed
to post even one sentry. what wind there was was from the northeast and the fox,
coming up the combe from the west, might have broken in upon them without
warning. but from this danger they had been saved by fiver and pipkin going into
the open. even in his flash of alarm as pipkin spoke, it crossed hazel's mind that
fiver, no doubt reluctant to advise him in front of the others, had probably seized
the opportunity provided by pipkin's fear to post himself as a sentry.
     hazel thought quickly. if the fox were not too close, all they had to do was run.
there was woodland nearby and they could vanish into it, keeping more or less
together, and simply continue on their way. he pushed through the burdocks.

     the fox had quickened its pace and was now some distance away from them. it
appeared to be overtaking bigwig. the sun had set and in the failing light they
could just make him out as he entered the undergrowth. he disappeared and the

fox followed. for several moments all was quiet. then, horribly clear across the
darkening, empty combe, there came the agonizing squeal of a stricken rabbit.
     "o frith and inlé!" cried blackberry, stamping. pipkin turned to bolt. hazel did
not move.
     "shall we go, hazel?" asked silver. "we can't help him now."
     as he spoke, bigwig suddenly broke out of the trees, running very fast. almost
before they could grasp that he was alive, he had recrossed the entire upper slope
of the combe in a single dash and bolted in among them.
     "come on," said bigwig, "let's get out of here!"
     "but what -- what -- are you wounded?" asked bluebell in bewilderment.
     "no," said bigwig, "never better! let's

for signs of an efrafan patrol, they saw nothing but mice, and a few hedgehogs
hunting for slugs along the ditches.
     at last, as the first lark rose toward the light that was still far up in the sky,
silver, his pale fur sodden dark with dew, came limping back to where hazel was
encouraging bluebell and pipkin.
     "you can pluck up your spirits, bluebell," he said. "i think we're close to the
iron road."

     "i wouldn't care about my spirits," said bluebell, "if my legs weren't so tired.
slugs are lucky not to have legs. i think i'll be a slug."
     "well, i'm a hedgehog," said hazel, "so you'd better get on!"
     "you're not," replied bluebell. "you haven't enough fleas. now, slugs don't
have fleas, either. how comforting to be a slug, among the dandelions so snug--"

giving off their strong scent. the bats were hunting among the flies and moths
attracted to the soapwort.
     hazel passed hraka and began to feed in the field. he was disturbed to find
that his hind leg was troubling him. he had thought that it was healed, but the
forced journey over the downs had evidently proved too much for the muscle torn
by the shotgun pellets. he wondered whether it was far to the river of which
kehaar had spoken. if it was, he was in for trouble.
     "hazel-rah," said pipkin, coming up from among the soapwort, "are you all
right? your leg looks queer -- you're dragging it."
     "no, it's all right," said hazel. "look, hlao-roo, where's kehaar? i want to talk
to him."
     "he's flown out to see if there's a patrol anywhere near, hazel-rah. bigwig
woke some time ago and he and silver asked kehaar to go. they didn't want to
disturb you."
     hazel felt irritated. it would have been better to be told at once which way to

traveler in foreign parts who did not know what he was going to find. there is
nothing that cuts you down to size like coming to some strange and marvelous
place where no one even stops to notice that you stare about you.
     the rabbits were uneasy and confused. they crouched on the grass, sniffing
the water smells in the cooling, sunset air: and moved closer together, each
hoping not to see in the others the nervousness he felt in himself. as pipkin
reached the path a great, shimmering dragonfly, four inches long, all emerald and
sable, appeared at his shoulder, hovered, droning and motionless, and was gone
like lightning into the sedge. pipkin leaped back in alarm. as he did so there came
a shrill, vibrant cry and he caught sight, between the plants, of a brilliant azure
bird flashing past over the open water. a few moments later there came, from
close behind the plant hedge, the sound of a fairly heavy splash: but what creature
might hav

e made it there was no telling.
     looking round for hazel, pipkin caught sight of kehaar, a little way off,
standing in a patch of shallow water between two clumps of willow herb. he was
stabbing and snapping at something in the mud and after a few moments pulled
out a six-inch leech and swallowed it whole. beyond him, some distance down the
path, hazel was combing the goose grass out of his coat and evidently listening to
fiver as they sat together under a rhododendron. pipkin ran along the bank and
joined them.
     "there's nothing wrong with the place," fiver was saying. "there's no more
danger here than anywhere else. kehaar's going to show us where to get across,
isn't he? the thing to do is to get on with it before it gets dark."
     "they'll never stop here," replied hazel. "we can't stay and wait for bigwig in a
place like this. it's unnatural for rabbits."
     "yes, we can -- calm down. they'll get used to it quicker than you think. i tell
you, it's better

are bad. would you like me to take them over? say it's because of your leg."
     "fine," said hazel. "hlao-roo, can you get everyone along here?"
     when pipkin had gone, he said, "i feel troubled, fiver. i'm asking so much of
them, and there are so many risks in this plan."
     "they're a better lot than you give them credit for," replied fiver. "if you were
to--"
     kehaar called raucously across, startling a wren out of the bushes.
     "meester 'azel, vat for you vait?"
     "to know where to go," answered fiver.
     "pridge near. you go on, you see."

     "do you think we can risk it, fiver?" he asked.
     "i can't see why you're bothered," answered fiver. "you went into the farmyard
and the shed where the hutch rabbits were. this is much less dangerous. come on
-- they're all watching while we hesitate."
     fiver hopped out on the road. he looked round for a moment and then made
his way to the nearer end of the bridge. hazel followed him along the verge,
keeping close beside the rail on the upstream side. looking round, he saw pipkin
close behind. in the middle of the bridge fiver, who was perfectly calm and
unhurried, stopped and sat up. the other two joined him.
     "let's put on a bit of an act," said fiver. "make them inquisitive. they'll follow
us just to see what we're looking at."
     there was no sill along the edge of the bridge: they could have walked off it
into the water three feet below. from under the lowest rail they looked out,
upstream, and now, for the first time, saw the whole river plainly. if the brid

floating sedge fly and sank back under water. a ripple spread outward in
subsiding circles, breaking both the reflections and the transparency. gradually
the stream grew smooth and once more they saw the fish below them, waving its
tail as it held its place in the current.
     "a water hawk!" said fiver. "so they hunt and eat down there, too! don't fall
in, hlao-roo. remember el-ahrairah and the pike."
     "would it eat me?" asked pipkin, staring.
     "there may be creatures in there that could," said hazel. "how do we know?
come on, let's get across. what would you do if a hrududu came?"
     "run," said fiver simply, "like this." and he scurried off the further end of the
bridge into the grass beyond.
     on this far side of the river, undergrowth and a grove of great horse chestnuts
extended almost down to the bridge. the ground was marshy, but at least there
was plenty of cover. fiver and pipkin began at once on some scra

over the very low side, watching a stone-colored, black-spotted trout swim up
into the fall. the "boat" was a miniature punt, used for reed-cutting -- little more
than a raft, with a single thwart amidships. even when it was unmanned, as now,
there were only a few inches of freeboard.
     "you know," said fiver from the bank, "seeing you sitting there reminds me of
that other wooden thing you found when the dog was in the wood and you got
pipkin and me over the river. do you remember?"
     "i remember shoving you along," said bigwig. "it was jolly cold."
     "what puzzles me," said blackberry, "is why this boat thing doesn't go along.
everything in this river goes along, and fast, too -- see there." he looked out at a
piece of stick floating down on the even two-mile-an-hour current. "so what's
stopping this thing from going?"
     kehaar had a short-way-with-landlubbers manner which he sometimes used to
those of the rabbits that he

said hazel, rather dejectedly. "i'm afraid we
don't seem to be any nearer to finding what we're looking for, kehaar. can you
possibly wait until tomorrow? i had the idea that we might all move to
somewhere a bit drier before tonight -- higher up in the wood, away from the
river."
     "oh, what a pity!" said bluebell. "do you know, i'd quite decided to become a
water rabbit."
     "a what?" asked bigwig.
     "a water rabbit," repeated bluebell. "well, there are water rats and water
beetles and pipkin says that last night he saw a water hawk. so why not a water
rabbit? i shall float merrily along--"
     "great golden frith on a hill!" cried blackberry suddenly. "great jumping
rabscuttle! that's it! that's it! bluebell, you shall be a water rabbit!" he began
leaping and skipping about on the bank and cuffing fiver with his front paws.
"don't you see, fiver? don't you see? we bite the rope and off we go: and general
woundwort doesn't know!"
     fiver paused. "yes, i do see," he replied at le

     "you couldn't do any good by yourself, hazel, even if your leg was all right.
you're trying to eat grass that isn't there. why don't you give it a chance to grow?"
     they returned under the arch and as silver came out of the bushes to meet
them, they could hear the other rabbits stirring uneasily among the nettles.
     "we'll have to give it up for tonight, silver," said hazel. "we must get them
back over the river now, before it's completely dark."
     "hazel-rah," said pipkin, as he slipped by, "it -- it is going to be all right, isn't
it? bigwig will come tomorrow, won't he?"
     "of course he will," said hazel, "and we'll all be here to help him. and i'll tell
you something else, hlao-roo. if he doesn't come tomorrow, i'm going into efrafa
myself."
     "i'll come with you, hazel-rah," said pipkin.

     bigwig crouched in his burrow, pressed against hyzenthlay. he was trembling,
but not with cold: the stuffy runs of the mark were dense with thun

you want us to do?" it was silver.
     "where's hazel?" he said.
     "waiting at the boat. i say, you're wounded! what--"
     "then get these does down there," said bigwig.
     all was confusion. in ones and twos the does, utterly bemused and scarcely
able to move or to understand what was said to them, were urged into getting up
and stumbling their way down the field. other rabbits began to appear through
the rain: acorn, clearly frightened, but determined not to run; dandelion
encouraging pipkin; speedwell and hawkbit making toward kehaar -- the only
creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made them understand that they were to help to get the
does away.
     "go back to blackberry, go back to blackberry," silver kept repeating. "i left
three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then bluebell, then fiver -- he's quite near the river."

submerged branches and no gravel spits or beds of weed above the surface at all.
from bank to bank the current, regular and unvaried, flowed as fast as a man
strolling. the punt slipped downstream smoothly, without any alteration of the
speed which it had gained within a few yards of leaving the bank.
     most of the rabbits had very little idea of what was happening. the efrafan
does had never seen a river and it would certainly have been beyond pipkin or
hawkbit to explain to them that they were on a boat. they -- and nearly all the
others -- had simply trusted hazel and done as they were told. but all -- bucks
and does alike -- realized that woundwort and his followers had vanished.
wearied by all they had gone through, the sodden rabbits crouched without
talking, incapable of any feeling but a dull relief and without even the energy to
wonder what was going to happen next.
     that they should feel any relief -- dull or otherwise -- was r

not see him? they must
see him. he was lying at their feet. he was wounded. they were coming to pick
him up.
     then the sounds and smells were receding into the distance, the thudding of
the footsteps diminished. the men had crossed the bridge without looking over
the parapet. they were gone.
     hazel came to. "that settles it," he said. "everyone's got to swim. come on,
bluebell, you say you're a water rabbit. follow me." he got on the thwart and
went along it to the side.
     but it was pipkin that he found next to him.
     "quick, hazel-rah," said pipkin, twitching and trembling. "i'll come, too. only
be quick."
     hazel shut his eyes and fell over the side into the water.
     as in the enborne, there was an instant shock of cold. but more than this, and
at once, he felt the pull of the current. he was being drawn away by a force like a
high wind, yet smooth and silent. he was drifting helplessly down a suffocating,
cold run, with no hold for his feet. full of fear, he paddled a

 them again as he was dragged on. then the current slackened, the run
vanished, the dark became light and there were leaves and sky above him once
more. still struggling, he fetched up against something hard, bumped off it,
struck it again and then for a moment touched soft ground. he floundered
forward and found that he was dragging himself through liquid mud. he was out
on a clammy bank. he lay panting for several moments and then wiped his face
and opened his eyes. the first thing he saw was pipkin, plastered with mud,
crawling to the bank a few feet away.
     full of elation and confidence, all his terrors forgotten, hazel crawled over to
pipkin and together they slipped into the undergrowth. he said nothing and
pipkin did not seem to expect him to speak. from the shelter of a clump of purple
loosestrife they looked back at the river.
     the water came out from the bridge into a second pool. all round, on both
banks, trees and undergrowth grew close. there was a kind of swamp here and

     as he spoke, a third rabbit came swimming out from under the bridge. the
sight of him, struggling in the current like a fly in a spider's web, filled them both

with fear. to watch another in danger can be almost as bad as sharing it. the
rabbit fetched up against the grating, drifted a little way along it, found the
bottom and crawled out of the turbid water. it was blackavar. he lay on his side
and seemed unaware of hazel and pipkin when they came up to him. after a little
while, however, he began to cough, vomited some water and sat up.
     "are you all right?" asked hazel.
     "more or less," said blackavar. "but have we got to do much more tonight, sir?
i'm very tired."
     "no, you can rest here," said hazel. "but why did you risk it on your own? we
might already have gone under, for all you knew."
     "i thought you gave an order," replied blackavar.
     "i see," said hazel. "well, at that rate you're going to fi

     holly and blackavar reached the long shadow of the wood at top speed, as
though they were being pursued. the watchers expected them to slow down as
they came to the bank, but they kept straight on and appeared actually to be
going to run underground. at the last moment holly stopped, looked about him
and stamped twice. blackavar disappeared down the nearest hole. at the
stamping, all the rabbits above ground ran for cover.
     "here, wait a minute," said hazel, pushing past pipkin and hawkbit as they
came across the grass. "holly, what's the alarm? tell us something, instead of
stamping the place to pieces. what's happened?"
     "get the holes filled in!" gasped holly. "get everyone underground! there's not
a moment to lose." his eyes rolled white and he panted foam over his chin.
     "is it men, or what? there's nothing to be seen, heard or smelled. come on, tell
us something and stop gibbering, there's a good chap."
     "it'll have to be quick, then," said holly. "t

like woundwort."
     "but suppose they break through the wall somewhere else?" said holly.
     "you must try to make them do it here," replied bigwig. "when you hear them
on the other side, make a noise -- do a bit of scratching or something -- just above
where i am. anything to get them interested. come on, help me to dig. and,
silver, get everyone back out of the honeycomb now and close this wall
completely."

     "bigwig," said pipkin, "i can't wake fiver. he's still lying out there in the
middle of the floor. what's to be done?"
     "i'm afraid there's nothing we can do now," replied bigwig. "it's a great pity,
but we'll have to leave him."
     "oh, bigwig," cried pipkin, "let me stay out there with him! you'll never miss
me, and i can go on trying--"
     "hlao-roo," said holly as kindly as he could, "if we lose no one but fiver before
this business is ended, then the lord frith himself will be fighting for us. no, i'm

he warren was saved. after a time, they dug carefully to
broaden the run and as the day wore on the does, each in turn, remained beside
him, licking his wounds and listening to his low, unsteady breathing.
     before this, blackberry and dandelion had burrowed their way in from
kehaar's run -- it had not been blocked very heavily -- and told their story. they
could not say what might have happened to hazel after the dog broke loose, and
by the early afternoon everyone feared the worst. at last pipkin, in great anxiety
and distress, insisted on setting out for nuthanger. fiver at once said that he
would go with him and together they left the wood and set off northward over the
down. they had gone only a short distance when fiver, sitting up on an anthill to
look about, saw a rabbit approaching over the high ground to the west. they both
ran nearer and recognized hazel. fiver went to meet him while pipkin raced back
to the honeycomb with the news.

you know," said silver. "he had him beat before the dog
came. that was what i was going to say just now, but it was as well i didn't, i
suppose."
     "i wonder how they're getting on with that winter burrow down the hill," said
hazel. "we're going to need it when the hard weather comes. that hole in the roof
of the honeycomb doesn't help at all. it'll close up naturally one day, i suppose,
but meanwhile it's a confounded nuisance."
     "here come the burrow-diggers, anyway," said silver.
     pipkin and bluebell came over the crest, together with three or four of the
does.
     "ah ha, ah ha, o hazel-rah," said bluebell. "the burrow's snug, it hath been
dug, t'is free from beetle, worm and slug. and in the snow, when down we go--"
     "then what a lot to you we'll owe," said hazel. "i mean it, too. the holes are
concealed, are they?"
     "just like efrafa, i should think," said bluebell. "as a matter of fact, i brought
one up with me to show you. you can't see it, can you? no -- well, th

he's got them all."
     "come over to the evening side of the wood with us, hazel-rah?" said pipkin.
"we came up early on purpose to have a bit of sunshine before it gets dark."
     "all right," answered hazel good-naturedly. "we've just come back from there,
silver and i, but i don't mind slipping over again for a bit."
     "let's go out to that little hollow where we found kehaar that morning," said
silver. "it'll be out of the wind. d'you remember how he cursed at us and tried to
peck us?"
     "and the worms we carried?" said bluebell. "don't forget them."
