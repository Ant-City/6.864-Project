 ring kareen's ring our ring please where
is it? the hand it was on is dead and it wasn't meant to be on rotten flesh. it was meant
always to be on my living finger on my living hand because it meant life.
"my mother gave it to me. it's a real moonstone. you can wear it."
"it won't fit."
"the little finger silly try the little finger."

"stop that stop it goddam you."
old mike birkman how did he get into the house so quietly was standing above them
in the darkness glaring down.
they both lay there on the sofa and stared up at him. he looked like an overgrown
dwarf because his back was crooked from twenty-eight years in the coal mines of
wyoming. twenty-eight years in the mines with an i.w.w. red card and damning
everybody. he stood and glared down at them and they made no move.
"i'll have none of this business going on in my house. you think this is the back seat

a flivver? now get up like a couple decent people. go on. get up from there k'reen."
kareen got up. she was only five feet one. mike swore it was because she didn't
have enough food when she was a kid but that probably wasn't the truth because her
mother had been small and kareen was perfectly formed and healthy and beautiful so
beautiful. mike was liable to exaggerate when he got excited. kareen looked up at old
mike unafraid.
"he's going away in the morning."
"i know. i know girl. get into the bedroom. both of you. maybe you never get
another chance. go on k'reen."
kareen took one long look at him and then with her head bent as if she were a very
busy child thinking about something walked into the bedroom.
"go on in there boy. she's scared. go in and put your arm around her."
he started to go and then he felt mike's grip against his shoulder. mike was looking
straight into his face and even in the dark his

"darling. oh darling. oh. oh my dear my dear my dear my"
they didn't sleep very much. sometimes they dozed off and awakened and found
that they were apart and came back to each other and held one another tight very tight as
if they had been lost forever and had just found each other all over again. and all night
long mike was stirring through the house and coughing and mumbling.
when morning came he stood over their bed holding a breadboard which had two
breakfasts on it.
"here you kids eat."
tough old mike standing there gentle and grizzled and fierce with bloodshot painful
eyes. mike had been in jail too many times not to be good. old mike who hated everybody.
he hated wilson and he hated hughes and he hated roosevelt and he hated the
socialists because they had only big talk and milk in their veins for blood.

 he even hated
debs a little although not much. twenty-eight years in the coal mine had fixed him up for
a fine hater. "and now i'm a railroad bull goddam me a railroad bull how's that for a
filthy way to make a living?" mike with his crooked back from the mines standing there
with their breakfasts.
"here you kids. hurry up and eat. you ain't got much time."
they ate. mike went grumbling off and didn't come into the room again. when they
had eaten they lay for a little while looking up at the ceiling and digesting their food.
"you rumbled."
"i did not. besides it isn't nice for you to mention it. it was you anyhow."
"it was a cute little rumble. i liked it."
"you're terrible. you get up first."
"no you get up first."
"oh joe kiss me don't go."
"hurry up you damned kids."
"you get up."
"you."
"i'll count—one two three."
they jumped out of bed. it was chilly. the

ing and there was a terrible
crowd at the station. the whole place the station and the cars and even the locomotives
were draped with bunting and the children and women mostly carried flags little flags
that they waved vaguely vacantly. there were three bands all seeming to play at once and
lots of officers herding people around and songs and the mayor giving an address and
people crying and losing each other and laughing and drunk.
his mother and his sisters were there and kareen was there and mike was there
muttering goddam fools and glaring at everybody and watching kareen sharply.

d out in time? while he slept with the nineteen
year old kareen every night was the real kareen with somebody else a woman now
perhaps with a baby? kareen grown up and far away having forgotten him . . .
he wished he could be near her. not that he could ever see her not that he wanted her
to see him. but he would like to feel that he was breathing the same air she breathed that
he was in the same country she was in. he remembered the funny excitement inside him
when he used to start out for old mike's house for kareen's house. the closer he got the
sweeter the air seemed. he used to tell himself although he knew it wasn't true that the air
around her house was different because it was near to her.
he had never cared particularly where he was where they had taken him—but
thinking now of kareen he got homesick. his mind was wailing i wish to god i was in
america i wish i was home. it seemed that an american any american was a friend
compared to any englishman or frenchman. that was because

 while corporal timlon read the burial service maybe
skipping over a few ands and ors but getting the general idea across pretty well.
about the middle of the service a couple flares went up from the other side and just
as the corporal was throwing the third handful of dirt into lazarus' face somebody got a
bead on him and shot him right smack through the bottom. corporal timlon hollered out
god 'ave mercy on your soul amen those bloody barstards 'ave shot me in the arse that's
wot they've done mike for cover men. and they all scrambled back to the lines.
corporal timlon got eight weeks hospital leave which was lucky for him because the
whole limey regiment was almost wiped out three weeks later. a couple days after
corporal timlon was shot lazarus stopped another one and hit the fence again with his
sheets flapping in the wind and parts of him dripping toward the ground. one of the
limeys said that was to be expected because bavarians never held up very well after the
first week. the whol
