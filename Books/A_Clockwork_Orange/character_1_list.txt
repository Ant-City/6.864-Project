Mr. Alexander - 
                Played
by Patrick Magee
                A famous writer and opponent
to the ruling party. Holed up in his ultramodern home, Mr. Alexander
writes books, deemed subversive by the government, about the need to
protect the rights of the individual from the government. However,
his concerns for the rights of the individual seem hypocritical
when we see he is ready to use Alex as a pawn to topple the government,
even if that means sacrificing Alex's life. In the novel, Mr. Alexander
is the character who introduces the phrase "a clockwork orange,"
which derives from the East London Cockney saying, "as queer as
a clockwork orange." This phrase suggests something that looks natural
and organic on the outside but that is artificial and mechanical
on the inside. Mr. Alexander claims that the government treats human
beings as if they were clockwork oranges--creatures who look human but
who can be manipulated and directed as if they were robots.
