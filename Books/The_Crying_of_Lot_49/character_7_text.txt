 is taken up by the bloodbath gennaro visits on the court of squamuglia. every mode of 

violent death available to renaissance man, including a lye pit, land mines, a trained falcon with envenom'd talons, is 
employed. it plays, as metzger remarked later, like a road runner cartoon in blank verse. at the end of it about the only 
character left alive in a stage dense with corpses is the colorless administrator, gennaro. 

according to the program, the courier's tragedy had been directed by one randolph driblette. he had also played the 

part of gennaro the winner. "look, metzger," oedipa said, "come on backstage with me." 
"you know one of them?" said metzger, anxious to 
leave. 
"i want to find out something. i want to talk to 
driblette." 
"oh, about the bones." he had a brooding look. 
oedipa said, 

"i don't know. it just has me uneasy. the two things, so close." 
"fine," metzger said, "and what next, picket the va.? march on washington? god protect me," he addressed the ceiling 
of the little the

dozen wells, fargo men battled gallantly with a band of masked marauders in mysterious "black uniforms. we owe this description to a 
post rider, the only witness to the massacre, who died shortly after. the only other clue was a cross, traced by one of the 
victims in the dust. to this day the identities of the slayers remain shrouded in mystery. 

a cross? or the initial t? the same stuttered by niccol6 in the courier's tragedy. oedipa pondered this. she called 
randolph driblette from a pay booth, to see it he'd known about this wells, fargo incident; if that was why he'd chosen to 
dress his bravos all in black. the phone buzzed on and on, into hollowness. she hung up and headed for zapf's used books. 
zapf himself came forward out of a wan cone of 15-watt illumination to help her find the paperback driblette had mentioned, 
jacobean revenge plays. 

"it's been very much in demand," zapf told her. the skull on the cover watched them, through the dim 

light.

no, thought oedipa, sad. as if their home cemetery in some way still did exist, in a land where you could somehow walk, and 
not need the east san nar-ciso freeway, and bones still could rest in peace, nourishing ghosts of dandelions, no one to plow them up. 
as if the dead really do persist, even in a bottle of wine.

though her next move should have been to contact randolph driblette again, she decided instead to drive up to berkeley. she wanted 
to find out where richard wharfinger had got his information about trystero. possibly also take a look at how the inventor john 
nefastis picked up his mail. 

as with mucho when she'd left kinneret, metzger did not seem desperate at her going. she debated, driving north, whether to 

stop off at home on the way to berkeley or coming back. as it turned out she missed the exit for kinneret and that solved it. she 
purred along up th

 her not to worry 
about the estate, that he'd turned over his execu-torship to somebody at warpe, wistfull, kubitschek and mcmingus, and they 
should be in touch with her, and it was all squared with the probate court also. no word to recall that oedipa and metzger had 
ever been more than co-executors. 

which must mean, thought oedipa, that that's all we were. she should have felt more classically scorned, but had other 

things on her mind. first thing after unpacking she was on the horn to randolph driblette, the director. after about ten rings 
an elderly lady answered. "i'm sorry, we've nothing to say." 
"well who's this," oedipa said. 

sigh. "this is his mother. there'll be a statement at noon tomorrow. our lawyer will read it." she hung up. now what the 
hell, oedipa wondered: what had happened to driblette? she decided to call later. she found professor emory bortz's number 
in the book and had better luck. a wife named grace answered, backed by a group of children. "he's pouring a patio," sh

mail routes. 

oedipa spent the next several days in and out of libraries and earnest discussions with emory bortz and genghis cohen. 

she feared a little for their security in view of what was happening to everyone else she knew. the day after reading blobb's 
peregrinations she, with bortz, grace, and the graduate students, attended randolph driblette's burial, listened to a younger 
brother's helpless, stricken eulogy, watched the mother, spectral in afternoon smog, cry, and came back at night to sit on the 
grave and drink napa valley muscatel, which driblette in his time had put away barrels of. there was no moon, smog 
covered the stars, all black as a tristero rider. oedipa sat on the earth, ass getting cold, wondering whether, as driblette had 
suggested that night from the shower, some version of herself hadn't vanished with him. perh
