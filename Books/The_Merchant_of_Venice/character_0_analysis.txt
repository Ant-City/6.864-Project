Shylock
Although critics tend to agree that Shylock is The
Merchant of Venice's most noteworthy figure, no consensus
has been reached on whether to read him as a bloodthirsty bogeyman,
a clownish Jewish stereotype, or a tragic figure whose sense of
decency has been fractured by the persecution he endures. Certainly,
Shylock is the play's antagonist, and he is menacing enough to seriously
imperil the happiness of Venice's businessmen and young lovers
alike. Shylock is also, however, a creation of circumstance; even
in his single-minded pursuit of a pound of flesh, his frequent mentions
of the cruelty he has endured at Christian hands make it hard for
us to label him a natural born monster. In one of Shakespeare's
most famous monologues, for example, Shylock argues that Jews are
humans and calls his quest for vengeance the product of lessons
taught to him by the cruelty of Venetian citizens. On the other
hand, Shylock's coldly calculated attempt to revenge the wrongs
done to him by murdering his persecutor, Antonio, prevents us from
viewing him in a primarily positive light. Shakespeare gives us
unmistakably human moments, but he often steers us against Shylock
as well, painting him as a miserly, cruel, and prosaic figure.
