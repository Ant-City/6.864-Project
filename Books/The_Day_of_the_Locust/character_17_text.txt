 another moment he would begin to remember, in
just another moment. he tried to fool his memory by overwhelming it with
tears and brought up the sobs that were always lurking uneasily in his
chest. he cried softly at first, then harder. the sound he made was like
that of a dog lapping gruel. he concentrated on how miserable and lonely
he was, but it didn't work. the thing he was trying so desperately to
avoid kept crowding into his mind.

one day when he was working in the hotel, a guest called romola martin
had spoken to him in the elevator.

"mr. simpson, you're mr. simpson, the bookkeeper?"

"yes."

"i'm in six-eleven."

she was small and childlike, with a quick, nervous manner. in her arms
she coddled a package which obviously contained a square gin bottle.

"yes," said homer again, working against his natural instinct to be
friendly. he knew that miss martin owed several weeks' rent and had heard
the room clerk say she was a drunkard.

"oh!..." the girl went on coquettishly, making obvious the

nd another of sardines. these and a half a pound of soda
crackers would be enough for his supper.

out on the street again with his parcel, he started to walk home. when he
reached the corner that led to pinyon canyon and saw how steep and black
the hill looked, he turned back along the lighted boulevard. he thought
of waiting until someone else started up the hill, but finally took a
taxicab.

although homer had nothing to do but prepare his scanty meals, he was not
bored. except for the romola martin incident and perhaps one or two other
widely spaced events, the forty years of his life had been entirely
without variety or excitement. as a bookkeeper, he had worked
mechanically, totaling figures and making entries with the same
impersonal detachment that he now opened cans of soup and made his bed.

someone watching him go about his little cottage might have thought him
sleep-walking or partially blind. his hands seemed to have a life and a
will of their own. it was they who pulled the shee

him, like the shell of a tortoise, as both spine and armor. he
couldn't shed it even in thought. if he did, he would be destroyed.

he was right. there are men who can lust with parts of themselves. only
their brain or their hearts burn and then not completely. there are
others, still more fortunate, who are like the filaments of an
incandescent lamp. they bum fiercely, yet nothing is destroyed. but in
homer's case it would be like dropping a spark into a barn full of hay.
he had escaped in the romola martin incident, but he wouldn't escape
again. then, for one thing, he had had his job in the hotel, a daily
all-day task that protected him by tiring him, but now he had nothing.

his thoughts frightened him and he bolted into the house, hoping to leave
them behind like a hat. he ran into his bedroom and threw himself down on
the bed. he was simple enough to believe that people don't think while
asleep.

in his troubled state, even this delusion was denied him and he was
unable to fall asleep. he clo

s at the far end of it, a soft bit
of shadow in the hard glare. he couldn't run, only crawl toward the black
patch. just as he was about to give up, habit came to his rescue. it
collapsed the shining tunnel and hurled him into the shadow.

when he awoke it was without a struggle. he tried to fall asleep once
more, but this time couldn't even find the tunnel. he was thoroughly
awake. he tried to think of how very tired he was, but he wasn't tired.
he felt more alive than he had at any time since romola martin.

outside a few birds still sang intermittently, starting and breaking off,
as though sorry to acknowledge the end of another day. he thought that he
heard the lisp of silk against silk, but it was only the wind playing in
the trees. how empty the house was! he tried to fill it by singing.

"oh, say can you see,
by the dawn's early light..."

it was the only song he knew. he thought of buying a victrola or a radio.
he knew, however, that he would buy neither. this fact made him very sad.
it was
