[CHARACTER] 
an insouciant twenty-four-year-old man, heir to a fortune,
and bearer of a name that his father purchased, alec is the nemesis
and downfall of tess's life. his first name, alexander, suggests
the conqueror--as in alexander the great--who seizes what he wants regardless
of moral propriety. yet he is more slippery than a grand conqueror.
his full last name, stoke-d'urberville, symbolizes the split character
of his family, whose origins are simpler than their pretensions
to grandeur. after all, stokes is a blunt and inelegant name. indeed,
the divided and duplicitous character of alec is evident to the
very end of the novel, when he quickly abandons his newfound christian
faith upon remeeting tess. it is hard to believe alec holds his
religion, or anything else, sincerely. his supposed conversion may
only be a new role he is playing.
	this duplicity of character is so intense in alec, and
its consequences for tess so severe, that he becomes diabolical.
the first part of his surname conjures associations with fiery energies,
as in the stoking of a furnace or the flames of hell. his devilish
associations are evident when he wields a pitchfork while addressing
tess early in the novel, and when he seduces her as the serpent
in genesis seduced eve. additionally, like the famous depiction
of satan in milton's paradise lost, alec does not
try to hide his bad qualities. in fact, like satan, he revels in
them. in chapter xii, he bluntly tells tess, "i suppose i am a bad
fellow--a damn bad fellow. i was born bad, and i have lived bad,
and i shall die bad, in all probability." there is frank acceptance
in this admission and no shame. some readers feel alec is too wicked
to be believable, but, like tess herself, he represents a larger
moral principle rather than a real individual man. like satan, alec
symbolizes the base forces of life that drive a person away from
moral perfection and greatness.
