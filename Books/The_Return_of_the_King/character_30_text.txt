ore he had a good deal of baggage, but he trotted along beside sam and seemed well content.
â€˜i wonder what old barliman was hinting at,â€™ said frodo.
â€˜i can guess some of it,â€™ said sam gloomily. â€˜what i saw in the mirror: trees cut down and all, and my old gaffer turned out of the row. i ought to have hurried back quicker.â€™
â€˜and somethingâ€™s wrong with the southfarthing evidently,â€™ said merry. â€˜thereâ€™s a general shortage of pipe-weed.â€™
â€˜whatever it is,â€™ said pippin, â€˜lotho will be at the bottom of it: you can be sure of that.â€™
â€˜deep in, but not at the bottom,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜you have forgotten saruman. he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did.â€™
â€˜well, weâ€™ve got you with us,â€™ said merry, â€˜so things will soon be cleared up.â€™
â€˜i am with you at present,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜but soon i shall not be. i am not coming to the shire. you must settle its affairs yourselves; that is what you have been trained for. do you not yet unders

cklander like you is doing here. you used to be on the hay gate.â€™
â€˜bless me! itâ€™s master merry, to be sure, and all dressed up for fighting!â€™ said old hob. â€˜why, they said you was dead! lost in the old forest by all accounts. iâ€™m pleased to see you alive after all!â€™
â€˜then stop gaping at me through the bars, and open the gate!â€™ said merry.
â€˜iâ€™m sorry, master merry, but we have orders.â€™
â€˜whose orders?â€™
â€˜the chiefâ€™s up at bag end.â€™
â€˜chief? chief? do you mean mr. lotho?â€™ said frodo.
â€˜i suppose so, mr. baggins; but we have to say just â€œthe chiefâ€ nowadays.â€™
â€˜do you indeed!â€™ said frodo. â€˜well, i am glad he has dropped the baggins at any rate. but it is evidently high time that the family dealt with him and put him in his place.â€™
a hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate. â€˜it wonâ€™t do no good talking that way,â€™ said one. â€˜heâ€™ll get to hear of it. and if you make so much noise, youâ€™ll wake the chiefâ€™s big man.â€™
â€˜we shall wake

â€˜well now, what about a smoke, while you tell us what has been happening in the shire?â€™ he said.
â€˜there isnâ€™t no pipe-weed now,â€™ said hob; â€˜at least only for the chiefâ€™s men. all the stocks seem to have gone. we do hear that waggon-loads of it went away down the old road out of the southfarthing, over sarn ford way. that would be the end oâ€™ last year, after you left. but it had been going away quietly before that, in a small way. that lotho-â€˜
â€˜now you shut up, hob hayward!â€™ cried several of the others. â€˜you know talk oâ€™ that sort isnâ€™t allowed. the chief will hear of it, and weâ€™ll all be in trouble.â€™
â€˜he wouldnâ€™t hear naught, if some of you here werenâ€™t sneaks,â€™ rejoined hob hotly.
â€˜all right, all right!â€™ said sam. â€œthatâ€™s quite enough. i donâ€™t want to hear no more. no welcome, no beer, no smoke, and a lot of rules and orc-talk instead. i hoped to have a rest, but i can see thereâ€™s work and trou

 come now and heâ€™ll do what sharkey says.â€™
â€˜and what may that be?â€™ said frodo quietly.
â€˜this country wants waking up and setting to rights,â€™ said the ruffian, â€˜and sharkeyâ€™s going to do it; and make it hard, if you drive him to it. you need a bigger boss. and youâ€™ll get one before the year is out, if thereâ€™s any more trouble. then youâ€™ll learn a thing or two, you little rat-folk.â€™
â€˜indeed. i am glad to hear of your plans,â€™ said frodo. â€˜i am on my way to call on mr. lotho, and he may be interested to hear of them too.â€™
the ruffian laughed. â€˜lotho! he knows all right. donâ€™t you worry. heâ€™ll do what sharkey says. because if a boss gives trouble, we can change him. see? and if little folks try to push in where theyâ€™re not wanted, we can put them out of mischief. see?â€™
â€˜yes, i see,â€™ said frodo. â€˜for one thing, i see that youâ€™re behind the times and the news here. much has happened since you left the south. your day is over, and all other ruffians

t swords and grim faces were a great surprise. and there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that they had not heard before. it chilled them with fear.
â€˜go!â€™ said merry. â€˜if you trouble this village again, you will regret it.â€™ the three hobbits came on, and then the ruffians turned and fled running away up the hobbiton road; but they blew their horns as they ran.
â€˜well, weâ€™ve come back none too soon,â€™ said merry.
â€˜not a day too soon. perhaps too late, at any rate to save lotho,â€™ said frodo. â€˜miserable fool, but i am sorry for him.â€™
â€˜save lotho? whatever do you mean?â€™ said pippin. â€˜destroy him i should say.â€™
â€˜i donâ€™t think you quite understand things, pippin,â€™ said frodo. â€˜lotho never meant things to come to this pass. he has been a wicked fool, but heâ€™s caught now. the ruffians are on top, gathering, robbing and bullying, and running or ruining things as they like, in his name. and not in his name even for much longer. heâ€™s a prisoner in bag

 end now, i expect, and very frightened. we ought to try and rescue him.â€™
â€˜well i am staggered!â€™ said pippin. â€˜of all the ends to our journey that is the very last i should have thought of: to have to fight half-orcs and ruffians in the shire itself - to rescue lotho pimple!â€™
â€˜fight?â€™ said frodo. â€˜well, i suppose it may come to that. but remember: there is to be no slaying of hobbits, not even if they have gone over to the other side. really gone over, i mean; not just obeying ruffiansâ€™ orders because they are frightened. no hobbit has ever killed another on purpose in the shire, and it is not to begin now. and nobody is to be killed at all, if it can be helped. keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last possible moment!â€™

are many of these ruffians,â€™ said merry, â€˜it will certainly mean fighting. you wonâ€™t rescue lotho, or the shire, just by being shocked and sad, my dear frodo.â€™
â€˜no,â€™ said pippin. â€˜it wonâ€™t be so easy scaring them a second time. they were taken by surprise. you heard that horn-blowing? evidently there are other ruffians near at hand. theyâ€™ll be much bolder when thereâ€™s more of them together. we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night. after all weâ€™re only four, even if we are armed.â€™

ps, knives, and clubs, enough for their dirty work: thatâ€™s all theyâ€™ve showed so far,â€™ said cotton. â€˜but i dare say theyâ€™ve got other gear, if it comes to fighting. some have bows, anyway. theyâ€™ve shot one or two of our folk.â€™
â€˜there you are, frodo!â€™ said merry. â€˜i knew we should have to fight. well, they started the killing.â€™
â€˜not exactly,â€™ said cotton. â€˜leastways not the shooting. tooks started that. you see our dad mr. peregrin, heâ€™s never had no truck with this lotho, not from the beginning: said that if anyone was going to play the chief at this time of day, it would be the right thain of the shire and no upstart. and when lotho sent his men they got no change out of him. tooks are lucky, theyâ€™ve got those deep holes in the green hills, the great smials and all, and the ruffians canâ€™t come at â€˜em; and they wonâ€™t let the ruffians come on their land. if they do, tooks hunt â€˜em. tooks shot three for prowling and robbing. after that the ruffians turn

d they came at last to the once beloved place. the garden was full of huts and sheds, some so near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light. there were piles of refuse everywhere. the door was scarred; the bell-chain was dangling loose, and the bell would not ring. knocking brought no answer. at length they pushed and the door yielded. they went in. the place stank and was full of filth and disorder: it did not appear to have been used for some time.
â€˜where is that miserable lotho hiding?â€™ said merry. they had searched every room and found no living thing save rats and mice. â€˜shall we turn on the others to search the sheds?â€™
â€˜this is worse than mordor!â€™ said sam. â€˜much worse in a way. it comes home to you, as they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it was all ruined.â€™
â€˜yes, this is mordor,â€™ said frodo. â€˜just one of its works. saruman was doing its work all the time, even when he thought he was working for himself. and the same with th

merry looked round in dismay and disgust. â€˜letâ€™s get out!â€™ he said. â€˜if i had known all the mischief he had caused, i should have stuffed my pouch down sarumanâ€™s throat.â€™
â€˜no doubt, no doubt! but you did not, and so i am able to welcome you home.â€™ there standing at the door was saruman himself, looking well-fed and well-pleased; his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement.
a sudden light broke on frodo. â€˜sharkey!â€™ he cried.
saruman laughed. â€˜so you have heard the name,

hey gripped on their weapons. wormtongue hesitated, and then followed his master.
â€˜wormtongue!â€™ called frodo. â€˜you need not follow him. i know of no evil you have done to me. you can have rest and food here for a while, until you are stronger and can go your own ways.â€™
wormtongue halted and looked back at him, half prepared to stay. saruman turned. â€˜no evil?â€™ he cackled. â€˜oh no! even when he sneaks out at night it is only to look at the stars. but did i hear someone ask where poor lotho is hiding? you know, donâ€™t you, worm? will you tell them?â€™
wormtongue cowered down and whimpered: â€˜no, no!â€™
â€˜then i will,â€™ said saruman. â€˜worm killed your chief, poor little fellow, your nice little boss. didnâ€™t you, worm? stabbed him in his sleep, i believe. buried him, i hope; though worm has been very hungry lately. no, worm is not really nice. you had better leave him to me.â€™

then there was lobelia. poor thing, she looked very old and thin when they rescued her from a dark and narrow cell. she insisted on hobbling out on her own feet; and she had such a welcome, and there was such clapping and cheering when she appeared, leaning on frodoâ€™s arm but still clutching her umbrella, that she was quite touched, and drove away in tears. she had never in her life been popular before. but she was crushed by the news of lothoâ€™s murder, and she wouldâ€™ not return to bag end. she gave it back to frodo, and went to her own people, the bracegirdles of hardbottle.
when the poor creature died next spring-she was after all more than a hundred years old - frodo was surprised and much moved: she had left all that remained of her money and of lothoâ€™s for him to use in helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles. so that feud was ended.
old will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer than any, and though he had perha
