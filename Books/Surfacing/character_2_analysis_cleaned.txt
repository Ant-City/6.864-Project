[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is the model of male dominance in surfacing. [CHARACTER]
initially appears to be an ideal husband, as he jokes and flirts with anna.
however, atwood twists her portrayal of [CHARACTER] by revealing the cruelty that
underscores his jokes and the emptiness of his flirtation. under the guise of
joking, [CHARACTER] constantly tries to control anna's behavior. as the week
progresses, he becomes overtly antagonistic toward her, calling her fat and
snubbing her ideas, and eventually uses psychological cruelty to dominate her.
he also objectifies anna by referring to her body in front of joe. the narrator
recognizes that [CHARACTER]'s flirtation serves as a display. she calls his banter
with anna a "skit," noticing that both [CHARACTER] and anna drop their flirtation once
they lose their audience.
[CHARACTER] spews generic anti-american sentiment, calling the americans pigs
and proposing that they be thrown out of canada. however, these anti-american
politics lack substance. the best justification that [CHARACTER] can muster for hating
americans is a ridiculous prediction of an american invasion of canada. [CHARACTER]
possesses nearly all of the despicable characteristics the narrator comes to
associate with americans. additionally, his own life seems at odds with his
anti-american sentiments. [CHARACTER] loves the distinctly american pastime of
baseball, and he constantly laughs like the american cartoon character woody
woodpecker. [CHARACTER]'s political standing illustrates that americans are marked by
behaviors and not by nationality.
