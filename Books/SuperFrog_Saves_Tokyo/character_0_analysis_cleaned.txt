[CHARACTER]
on the surface, there doesn't seem to be much to [CHARACTER]. forty and socially awkward, with flat feet and a receding hairline, [CHARACTER] has little family and fewer friends. underneath his unremarkable exterior, however, [CHARACTER] harbors some truly remarkable qualities. frog respects [CHARACTER] for his wisdom and courage as well as for the quiet, steady way he faces challenges without ever seeking any reward. [CHARACTER]'s isolation might be seen as a manifestation of his modesty, evidence of a desire to avoid imposing himself on the world or asking too much of it. companionship is one of the many rewards that [CHARACTER] deserves but never receives.


in frog and his mission, [CHARACTER] finds recognition and validation for an entire life of silent struggles. although [CHARACTER] appears to be right back where he started at the end of the story--with no friends, reward, or recognition for having helped save tokyo--the deep, tranquil sleep that [CHARACTER] falls into is one of satisfaction and relief. not only did he save 150,000 lives, but for once, after a life of slipping through the shadows and hovering in the background, [CHARACTER] knows he has truly been perceived and witnessed by another person--even if that person happened to be a giant, talking--and possibly imaginary--frog.
