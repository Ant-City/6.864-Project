 joe the baby-grabber.  keep  away  from  him,  she  says. 
he  is  full  of danger.  benny  and  blanca  own  the  comer 
store. they're okay except don't lean on the candy counter. 
two girls  raggedy as  rats live across the street.  you don't 
want to know them. edna is the lady who'owns the building 
next to you. she used to own a building big as a whale, but 
her brother sold it.  their mother said  no,  no,  don't ever 
sell  it.  i  won't.  and then she closed  her eyes and he sold 
it. alicia is stuck-up ever since she went to college. she used 
to like me but now she doesn't.

though she lets  the little one do all  the talking.

you,  rachel. 

thirty words that say  what you are. 

oh yeah, well  i  can think of some more. 
uh-oh, nenny. better get the broom. too much trash 

and what about the kind that looks like you combed 

in our yard today. 

its  hair? yes,  those are clouds too. 

phyllis,  ted, alfredo and julie ... 
there  are  clouds  that  look  like  big  fields  of sheep, 

rachel  says.  them are my  favorite. 

and don't forget nimbus the rain cloud, i  add, that's 

something. 

jose  and  dagoberto,  alicia,  raul,  edna,  alma  and 

rickey ... 

there's that wide puffy cloud that looks like your face 
when you wake up after falling asleep with all your clothes 
on. 

reynaldo,  angelo,  albert, armando, mario ... 
not my  face.  looks like your fat  face. 
rita,  margie, ernie ... 
whose fat  face?

age. 

that's right,  i  add before  lucy  or rachel can make 

fun of her. she is  stupid alright,  but she is  my  sister. 

but most important, hips are scientific, i say repeating 
what alicia already told me. it's the bones that let you know 
which skeleton was a  man's when it was a  man and which 
a  woman's. 

they bloom like roses, i continue because it's obvious 
i'm the only one who can speak with any authority;  i have 
science on my side. the bones just one day open. just like 
that.  one  day  you  might  decide  to  have  kids,  and  then 
where are you going to put them? got to have room. bones 
got to give. 

but don't have too many or your behind will spread.

house

my own 

not  a  rat.  not  an  apartment  in  back.  not  a  man's 
house.  not a daddy·s. a house all  my  own.  with my  porch 
and  my  pillow,  my  pretty  purple  petunias.  my  books and 
my  stories.  my  two  shoes  waiting  beside the bed.  nobody 
to shake a stick  at.  nobody's garbage to pick  up after. 

only a  house quiet as snow, a space for myself
