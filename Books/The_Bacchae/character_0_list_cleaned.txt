[CHARACTER]  - 
      originator, protagonist and central axis of the bacchae, this god of wine, theater and group ecstasy appears mostly in disguise as a beautiful, longhaired, wine-flushed lydian, the stranger. his non-human forms and powers are also felt acutely throughout the play and [CHARACTER] the god is clearly different from [CHARACTER] in disguise, as the stranger, and yet they are the same. still, they exist in their different forms simultaneously, so while the audience and the chorus hear the divine god give the command for the earthquake, the stranger is inside the palace torturing pentheus. [CHARACTER] is the son of zeus and the mortal semele, daughter of cadmus.
