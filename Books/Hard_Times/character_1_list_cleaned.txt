[CHARACTER] - 
                	gradgrind's
daughter, later bounderby's wife. confused by her coldhearted upbringing,
[CHARACTER] feels disconnected from her emotions and alienated from other
people. while she vaguely recognizes that her father's system of
education has deprived her childhood of all joy, [CHARACTER] cannot actively
invoke her emotions or connect with others. thus she marries bounderby
to please her father, even though she does not love her husband.
indeed, the only person she loves completely is her brother tom.
