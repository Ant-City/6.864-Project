'alas!' said aragorn. 'thus passes the heir of denethor, lord of the tower of guard! this is a bitter end. now the company is all in ruin. it is i that have failed. vain was gandalf's trust in me. what shall i do now? boromir has laid it on me to go to minas tirith, and my heart desires it; but where are the ring and the bearer? how shall i find them and save the quest from disaster?'
he knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping boromir's hand. so it was that legolas and gimli found him. they came from the western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. gimli had his axe in hand, and legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent. when they came into the glade they halted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to them plain what had happened.
'alas!' said legolas, coming to aragorn's side. 'we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods, but we should have been of more use here

. we came when we heard the horn-but too late, it seems. i fear you have taken deadly hurt.'
'boromir is dead,' said aragorn. 'i am unscathed, for i was not here with him. he fell defending the hobbits, while i was away upon the hill.'
'the hobbits!' cried gimli 'where are they then? where is frodo?'
'i do not know,' answered aragorn wearily. 'before he died boromir told me that the orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. i sent him to follow merry and pippin; but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him: not until it was too late. all that i have done today has gone amiss. what is to be done now?'
'first we must tend the fallen,' said legolas. 'we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs.'
'but we must be swi

'but we do not know whether the ring-bearer is with them or not ' said aragorn. 'are we to abandon him? must we not seek him first? an evil choice is now before us!'
'then let us do first what we must do,' said legolas. 'we have not the time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. a cairn we might build.'
'the labour would be hard and long: the

'then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his vanquished foes,' said aragorn. 'we will send him to the falls of rauros and give him to anduin. the river of gondor will take care at least that no evil creature dishonours his bones.'
quickly they searched the bodies of the orcs, gathering their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap. 'see!' cried aragorn. 'here we find tokens!' he picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives, leaf-bladed, damasked in gol

tature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. they were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with orcs: and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of men. upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an s-rune, wrought of some white metal.
'i have not seen these tokens before,' said aragorn. 'what do they mean?'
's is for sauron,' said gimli. 'that is easy to read.'
'nay!' said legolas. 'sauron does not use the elf-runes.'
'neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,' said aragorn. 'and he does not use white. the orcs in the service of barad-dûr use the sign of the red eye.' he stood for a moment in thought. 's is for saruman, i guess,' he said at length. 'there is evil afoot in isengard, and the west is no longer safe. it is as gandalf feared: by some means the traitor saruman has had news of our jour

ney. it is likely too that he knows of gandalf's fall. pursuers from moria may have escaped the vigilance of lórien, or they may have avoided that land and come to isengard by other paths. orcs travel fast. but saruman has many ways of learning news. do you remember the birds?'
'well, we have no time to ponder riddles,' said gimli. 'let us bear boromir away!'
'but after that we must guess the riddles, if we are to choose our course rightly,' answered aragorn.
'maybe there is no right choice,' said gimli.
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches. these they lashed together with bowstrings, and spread their cloaks upon the frame. upon this rough bier they carried the body of their companion to the shore, together with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him. it was only a short way, y

et they found it no easy task, for boromir was a man both tall and strong.
at the water-side aragorn remained, watching the bier. while legolas and gimli hastened back on foot to parth galen. it was a mile or more, and it was some time before they came back, paddling two boats swiftly along the shore.
'there is a strange tale to tell!' said legolas. 'there are only two boats upon the bank. we could find no trace of the other.'
'have orcs been there?' asked aragorn.
'we saw no signs of them,' answered gimli. 'and orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.'
'i will look at the ground when we come there,' said aragor

and rauros, golden rauros-falls, bore him upon its breast.'
'o boromir! the tower of guard shall ever northward gaze
to rauros, golden rauros-falls, until the end of days.'
so they ended. then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the stream back to parth galen.
'you left the east wind to me,' said gimli, 'but i will say naught of it.'
'that is as it should be,' said aragorn. 'in minas tirith they endure the east wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. but now boromir has taken his road. and we must make haste to choose our own.'
he surveyed the green lawn, quickly but thoroughly, stooping often to the earth. 'the orcs have been on this ground,' he said. 'otherwise nothing can be made out for certain. all our footprints are here, crossing and re-crossing. i cannot tell whether any of the hobb

'how then do you read this riddle?' asked gimli.
aragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-place and looked at the baggage. 'two packs are missing.' he said, 'and one is certainly sam's: it was rather large and heavy. this then is the answer: frodo has gone by boat, and his servant has gone with him. frodo must have returned while we were all away. i met sam going up the hill and told him to follow me; but plainly he did not do so. he guessed his master s mind and came back here before frodo had gone. he did not find it ea

sy to leave sam behind!'
'but why should he leave us behind, and without a word?' said gimli. 'that was a strange deed!'
'and a brave deed,' said aragorn. 'sam was right, i think. frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor. but he knew that he must go himself. something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt.'
'maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled,' said legolas.
'he fled, certainly,' said aragorn, 'but not, i think, from orcs.' what he thought was the cause of frodo's sudden resolve and flight aragorn did not say. the last words of boro

mir he long kept secret.
'well, so much at least is now clear,' said legolas: 'frodo is no longer on this side of the river: only he can have taken the boat. and sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'
'our choice then,' said gimli, 'is either to take the remaining boat and follow frodo, or else to follow the orcs on foot. there is little hope either way. we have already lost precious hours.'
'let me think!' said aragorn. 'and now may i make a right choice and change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' he stood silent for a moment. 'i will follow the orcs,' he said at last. 'i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with him to the end; but if i seek him now in the wilderness, i must abandon the captives to torment and

 left parth galen. the afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where boromir had fallen. there they picked up the trail of the orcs. it needed little skill to find.
'no other folk make such a trampling,' said legolas. 'it seems their delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way.'
'but they go with a great speed for all that,' said aragorn, 'and they do not tire. and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands.'
'well, after them!' said gimli. 'dwarves too can go swiftly, and they do not tire sooner than orcs. but it will be a long chase: they have a long start.'
'yes,' said aragorn, 'we shall all need the endurance of dwarves. but come! with hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies. and woe to them, if we prove the swifter! we will make such a chase as shall be accounted a marvel among the three kindreds µ elves. dwarves, and men. forth the three hunters!'
like a deer he sprang away. through the trees he sped.

up into the western ridge. legolas was some way ahead. suddenly the elf gave a cry and the others came running towards him.
'we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,' he said. 'look!' he pointed, and they saw that what they had at first taken to be boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies. five dead orcs lay there. they had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and two had been beheaded. the ground was wet with their dark blood.
'here is another riddle!' said gimli. 'but it needs the light of day and for that we cannot wait.'
'yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful,' said legolas. 'enemies of the orcs are likely to be our friends. do any folk dwell in these hills?'
'no,' said aragorn. 'the rohirrim seldom come here, and it is far from minas tirith. it might be that some company of men were hunting here for reasons that we do not know. yet i think not.'
'what do you think?' said gimli.
'i think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,' answe

red aragorn. 'these are northern orcs from far away. among the slain are none of the great orcs with the strange badges. there was a quarrel, i guess: it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk. maybe there was some dispute about the road.'
'or about the captives,' said gimli. 'let us hope that they, too, did not meet their end here.'
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle, but no other traces of the fight could be found. they went on. already the eastward sky was turning pale; the stars were fading, and a grey light was slowly growing. a little further north they came to a fold in which a tiny stream, falling and winding, had cut a stony path down into the valley. in it some bushes grew, and there were patches of grass upon its sides.
'at last!' said aragorn.

 indeed. i wonder what is his errand, if he is the same bird that i have seen before. but look! i can see something nearer at hand and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!'
'many things,' said legolas. 'it is a great company on foot; but i cannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. they are many leagues away: twelve, i guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure.'
'i think, nonetheless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us which way to go,' said gimli. 'let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be.'
'i doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the orcs chose,' said aragorn.
they followed their enemies now by the clear light of day. it seemed that the orcs had pressed on with all possible speed. every now and again the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the rinds and crusts of hard grey bread. a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the stones. the trail led them north

in front, and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the trampling. at the furthest point aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back.
'yes,' he said, 'they are quite plain: a hobbit's footprints. pippin's i think. he is smaller than the other. and look at this! he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight. it looked like the new-opened leaf of a beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain.
'the brooch of an elven-cloak!' cried legolas and gimli together.
'not idly do the leaves of lórien fall,' said aragorn. 'this did not drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow. i think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose.'
'then he at least was alive,' said gimli. 'and he had the use of his wits, and of his legs too. that is heartening. we do not pursue in vain.'
'let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,' said legolas. 'come! let us go on! the thought of those merry young folk driven like

as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted. only twice in the day's march had they rested for a brief while, and twelve leagues now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn.
'we have come at last to a hard choice,' he said. 'shall we rest by night, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?'
'unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we stay to sleep.' said legolas. 'surely even orcs must pause on the march?' said gimli. 'seldom will orcs journey in the open under the sun. yet these have done so,' said legolas. 'certainly they will not rest by night.'
'but if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,' said gimli.
'the trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my eyes can see,' said legolas.
'maybe, i could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line,' said aragorn; 'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when light came there might be long delay before the trail was

'and there is this also,' said gimli: 'only by day can we see if any tracks lead away. if a prisoner should escape, or if one should be carried off, eastward, say, to the great river, towards mordor, we might pass the signs and never know it.'
'that is true,' said aragorn. 'but if i read the signs back yonder rightly, the orcs of the white hand prevailed, and the whole company is now bound for isengard. their present course bears me out.'
'yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels,' said gimli. 'and what of escape? in the

dark we should have passed the signs that led you to the brooch.'
'the orcs will be doubly on their guard since then, and the prisoners even wearier,' said legolas. 'there will be no escape again, if we do not contrive it. how that is to be done cannot be guessed, but first we must overtake them.'
'and yet even i, dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my folk, cannot run all the way to isengard without any pause ' said gimli. 'my heart burns me too, and i would have started sooner but now i must rest a little to run the better. and if we rest, then the blind night is the time to do so.'
'i said that it was a hard choice,' said aragorn. 'how shall we end this debate?'
'you are our guide,' said gimli, 'and you are skilled in the chase. you shall choose.'
'my heart bids me go on,' said legolas. 'but we must hold together. i will follow your counsel.'
'you give the choice to an ill chooser,' said aragorn. 'since we pas

sed through the argonath my choices have gone amiss.' he fell silent gazing north and west into the gathering night for a long while.
'we will not walk in the dark,' he said at length. 'the peril of missing the trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the greater. if the moon gave enough light, we would use it, but alas! he sets early and is yet young and pale.'
'and tonight he is shrouded anyway,' gimli murmured. 'would that the lady had given us a light, such a gift as she gave to frodo!'
'it will be more needed where it is bestowed,' said aragorn. 'with him lies the true quest. ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time. a vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no choice of mine can mar or mend. well, i have chosen. so let us use the time as best we may!'

'they are far far away,' he said sadly, turning to aragorn. 'i know in my heart that they have not rested this night. only an eagle could overtake them now.'
'nonetheless we will still follow as we may,' said aragorn. stooping he roused the dwarf. 'come! we must go,' he said. 'the scent is growing cold.'
'but it is still dark,' said gimli. 'even le

'i fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon or sun,' said legolas.
'where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour,' said aragorn. 'the land must groan under their hated feet.' he stretched himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf. he lay there motionless, for so long a time that gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again. dawn came glimmering, and slowly a grey light grew about them. at last he rose, and now his friends could see his face: it was pale and drawn, and his look was troubled.
'the rumour of the earth is dim and confused,' he said. 'nothing walks upon it for many miles about us. faint and far are the feet of our enemies. but loud are the hoofs of the horses. it comes to my mind that i heard them, even as i lay on the ground in sleep, and they trouble

 twelve leagues they had passed over the plains of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was lost in the shadows of the east. the young moon was glimmering in a misty sky, but it gave small light, and the stars were veiled.
'now do i most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said legolas. 'the orcs have run before us, as if the very whips of sauron were behind them. i fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills, and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.'
gimli ground his teeth. 'this is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil!' he said.
'to hope, maybe, but not to toil,' said aragorn. 'we shall not turn back here. yet i am weary.' he gazed back along the way that they had come towards the night gathering in the east. 'there is something strange at work in this land. i distrust the silence. i distrust even the pale moon. the stars are faint; and i am weary as i have seldom been before, weary as no ranger should be with a clear trail to follow. th

the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts of the hills. aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely.
'they rested here a while,' he said, 'but even the outward trail is already old. i fear that your heart spoke truly, legolas: it is thrice twelve hours, i guess, since the orcs stood where we now stand. if they held to their pace, then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of fangorn.'
'i can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,' said gimli. 'could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?'
'it is still far away,' said aragorn. 'if i remember rightly, these downs run eight leagues or more to the north, and then north-west to the issuing of the entwash there lies still a wide land. another fifteen leagues it may be.'
'well, let us go on,' said gimli. 'my legs must forget the miles. they would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.'
the sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line of downs. for many ho

urs they had marched without rest. they were going slowly now, and gimli's back was bent. stone-hard are the dwarves in labour or journey, but this endless chase began to tell on him, as all hope failed in his heart. aragorn walked behind him, grim and silent, stooping now and again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. only legolas still stepped as lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass. leaving no footprints as he passed; but in the waybread of the elves he found all the sustenance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be

 green hill!' he said. wearily they followed him, climbing the long slope, until they came out upon the top. it was a round hill smooth and bare, standing by itself, the most northerly of the downs. the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain. they were alone in a grey formless world without mark or measure. only far away north-west there was a deeper darkness against the dying light: the mountains of mist and the forest at their feet.
'nothing can we see to guide us here,' said gimli. 'well, now we must halt again and wear the night away. it is growing cold!'
'the wind is north from the snows,' said aragorn.
'and ere morning it will be in the east,' said legolas. 'but rest if you must. yet do not cast all hope away. tomorrow is unknown. rede oft is found at the rising of the sun.'
'three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel ' said gimli.
the night grew ever colder. aragorn and gimli slept fitfully, and whenever they awoke they saw legolas standing bes

nt green, a dark swift-moving blur. he cast himself upon the ground and listened again intently. but legolas stood beside him, shading his bright elven-eyes with his long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the small figures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight. far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.
there was a silence in the empty fields, arid gimli could hear the air moving in the grass.
'riders!' cried aragorn, springing to his feet. 'many riders on swift steeds are coming towards us!'
'yes,' said legolas, 'there are one hundred and five. yellow is their hair, and bright are their spears. their leader is very tall.'
aragorn smiled. 'keen are the eyes of the elves,' he said.
'nay! the riders are little more than five leagues distant,' said legolas.
'five leagues or one,' said gimli; 'we cannot escape them in this bare land. shall we wait

'we will wait,' said aragorn. 'i am weary, and our hunt has failed. or at least others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back down the orc-trail. we may get new s from them.'
'or spears,' said gimli.
'there are three empty saddles, but i see no hobbits,' said legolas.
'i did not say that we should hear good news,' said aragorn. 'but evil or good we will await it here.'
the three companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy mark against the pale sky, and they walked slowly down the northward slope. a little above the hill's foot they halted, and wrapping their cloaks about them, they sat huddled together upon the faded grass. the time passed slowly and heavily. the wind was

'what do you know of these horsemen, aragorn?' he said. 'do we sit here waiting for sudden death?'
'i have been among them,' answered aragorn. 'they are proud and wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the children of men before the dark years. but i do not know what has happened here of late, nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be between the traitor saru

man and the threat of sauron. they have long been the friends of the people of gondor, though they are not akin to them. it was in forgotten years long ago that eorl the young brought them out of the north, and their kinship is rather with the bardings of dale, and with the beornings of the wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair, as are the riders of rohan. at least they will not love the orcs.'
'but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to mordor ' said gimli.
'i believe it no more than did boromir,' answered aragorn.
'you will soon learn the truth,' said legolas. 'already they approach.'
at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs. the horsemen, following the trail, had turned from the river, and were drawing near the downs. they were riding like the wind.
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields. suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and the foremost horseman swerved, passing by the foot

the rider looked at them with renewed wonder, but his eyes hardened. 'then there is a lady in the golden wood, as old tales tell!' he said. 'few escape her nets, they say. these are strange days! but if you have her favour, then you also are net-weavers and sorcerers, maybe.' he turned a cold glance suddenly upon legolas and gimli. 'why do you not speak, silent ones?' he demanded.
gimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart: his hand gripped the handle of his axe, and his dark eyes flashed. 'give me your name, horse-master, and i will give you mine, and more besides,' he said.
'as for that,' said the rider, staring down at the dwarf, 'the stranger should declare himself first. yet i am named éomer son of éomund, and am called the third marshal of riddermark.'
'then éomer son of éomund, third marshal of riddermark, l

aragorn threw back his cloak. the elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it, and the bright blade of andúril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out. 'elendil!' he cried. 'i am aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessar, the elfstone, dúnadan, the heir of isildur elendil's son of gondor. here is the sword that was broken and is forged again! will you aid me or thwart me? choose swiftly!'
gimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had not seen him in this mood before. he seemed to have grown in stature while éomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. for a moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown.

'and our friends?'
'we found none but orcs.'
'but that is strange indeed,' said aragorn. 'did you search the slain? were there no bodies other than those of orc-kind? they would be small. only children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.'
'there were no dwarves nor children,' said éomer. 'we counted all the slain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and burned them, as is our custom. the ashes are smoking still.'
'we do not speak of dwarves or children,' said gimli. 'our friends were hobbits.'
'hobbits?' said éomer. 'and what may they be? it is a strange name.'
'a strange name for a strange folk,' said gimli. 'but these were very dear to us. it seems that you have heard in rohan of the words that troubled minas tirith. they spoke of the halfling. these hobbits are halflings.'
'halflings!' laughed the rider that stood beside éomer. 'halflings! but they are only a little people in old songs and children's tales out of the north. do we walk in legends or o

'then you do not pay tribute to sauron?' said gimli.
'we do not and we never have.' said éomer with a flash of his eyes; 'though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. some years ago the lord of the black land wished to purchase horses of us at great price, but we refused him. for he puts beasts to evil use. then he sent plundering orcs, and they carry off what they can, choosing always the black horses: few of these are now left. for that reason our feud with the orcs is bitter.

'nonetheless we put an end to them. but we have been too long away. we are needed south and west. will you not come? there are spare horses as you see. there is work for the sword to do. yes, and we could find a use for gimli's axe and the bow of legolas, if they will pardon my rash words concerning the lady of the wood. i spoke only as do all men in my land, and i would gladly learn better.'
'i thank you for your fair words,' said aragorn, 'and my heart desires to come with you; but i cannot desert my friends while hope remains.'
'hope does not remain,' said éomer. 'you will not find your friends on the north-borders.'
'yet my friends are not behind. we found a clear token not far from the east wall that one at le

'i will not,' said aragorn.
there was great wonder, and many dark and doubtful glances, among his men, when éomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the strangers; but only éothain dared to speak openly.
'it may be well enough for this lord of the race of gondor, as he claims,' he said, 'but who has heard of a horse of the mark being given to a dwarf?'
'no one,' said gimli. 'and do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it. i would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great, free or begrudged.'
'but you must ride now, or you will hinder us,' said aragorn.
'come, you shall sit behind me, friend gimli, said legolas. then all will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.'
a great dark-grey horse was brought to aragorn, and he mounted it. 'hasufel is his name,' said éomer. 'may he bear you well and to better fortune than gárul

a smaller and lighter horse, but restive and fiery, was brought to legolas. arod was his name. but legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein. 'i need them not,' he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder arod was tame and willing beneath him, moving here and there with but a spoken word: such was the elvish way with all good beasts. gimli was lifted up behind his friend. and he clung to him, not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat.
'farewell, and may you find what you seek!' cried éomer. 'return with what speed you may, and let our swords hereafter shine together!'
'i will come,' said aragorn.
'and i will come, too,' said gimli. 'the matter of the lady galadriel lies still between us. i have yet to teach you gentle speech. '
'we shall see,' said éomer. 'so many strange things have chanced that to learn the praise of a

with that they parted. very swift were the horses of rohan. when after a little gimli looked back, the company of éomer were already small and far away. aragorn did not look back: he was watching the trail as they sped on their way, bending low with his head beside the neck of hasufel. before long they came to the borders of the entwash, and there they met the other trail of which éomer had spoken, coming down from the east out of the wold.
aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground, then leaping back into the saddle, he rode away for some distance eastward, keeping to one sid

hattered helm the white badge could still be seen. further away, not far from the river, where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood, there was a mound. it was newly raised: the raw earth was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears.
aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle, but the light faded, and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin.
'we can do no more,' said gimli sadly. 'we have been set many riddles since we came to tol brandir, but this is the hardest to unravel. i would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the orcs'. it will be hard news for frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in rivendell. elrond was against their coming.'
'but gandalf was not,' said legolas.
'but gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' answered gimli. 'his foresight failed him.'

a little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under a spreading tree: it looked like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of a former year, like dry hands with long splayed fingers; they rattled mournfully in the night-breeze.
gimli shivered. they had brought only one blanket apiece. 'let us light a fire,' he said. 'i care no longer for the danger. let the orcs come as thick as summer-moths round a candle!'
'if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw them hither,' said legolas.
'and it might draw other things, neither orc nor hobbit,' said aragorn. 'we are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor saruman. also we are on the very edge of fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood, it

 is said.'
'but the rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday,' said gimli, 'and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen. yet they passed the night after safely here, when their labour was ended.'
'they were many,' said aragorn, 'and they do not heed the wrath of fangorn, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under the trees. but our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself. so have a care! cut no living wood!'
'there is no need,' said gimli. 'the riders have left chip and bough enough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.' he went off to gather fuel, and busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but aragorn sat silent with his back to the great tree, deep in thought; and legolas stood alone in the open, looking towards the profound shadow of the wood, leaning forward, as one who listens to voices calling from a distance.
when the dwarf had a small bright blaze going, the three companions drew close to it and sat togethe

land, save only songs that tell how the onodrim, that men call ents, dwelt there long ago; for fangorn is old, old even as the elves would reckon it.'
'yes, it is old,' said aragorn, 'as old as the forest by the barrow-downs, and it is far greater. elrond says that the two are akin, the last strongholds of the mighty woods of the elder days, in which the firstborn roamed while men still slept. yet fangorn holds some secret of its own. what it is i do not know.'
'and i do not wish to know,' said gimli. 'let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubled on my account!'
they now drew lots for the watches, and the lot for the first watch fell to gimli. the others lay down. almost at once sleep laid hold on them. 'gimli!' said aragorn drowsily. 'remember, it is perilous to cut bough or twig from a living tree in fangorn. but do not stray far in search of dead wood. let the fire die rather! call me at need!'
with that he fell asleep. legolas already lay motionless, his fair hands folded upon his bre

ast, his eyes unclosed, blending living night and deep dream, as is the way with elves. gimli sat hunched by the fire, running his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe. the tree rustled. there was no other sound.
suddenly gimli looked up, and there just on the edge of the fire-light stood an old bent man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in a great cloak; his wide-brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes. gimli sprang up, too amazed for the moment to cry out, though at once the thought flashed into his mind that saruman had caught them. both aragorn and legolas, roused by his sudden movement, sat up and stared. the old man did not speak or make, sign.
'well, father, what can we do for you?' said aragorn, leaping to his feet. 'come and be warm, if you are cold!' he strode forward, but the old man was gone. there was no trace of him to be found near at hand, and they did not dare to wander far. the moon

dless leagues lay between them and the men of rohan, their only friends in this wide and dangerous land. as they stood, it seemed to them that they heard, far off in the night. the sound of horses whinnying and neighing. then all was quiet again, except for the cold rustle of the wind.
'well, they are gone,' said aragorn at last. 'we cannot find them or catch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we must do without. we started on our feet, and we have those still.'
'feet!' said gimli. 'but we cannot eat them as well as walk on them ' he threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it.
'only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of rohan,' laughed legolas. 'you will make a rider yet.'
'it seems unlikely that i shall have the chance,' said gimli.
'if you wish to know what i think,' he began again after a while 'i think it was saruman. who else? remember the words of éomer: he walks about like an old man hooded and cloaked. those were the words. he has g

'i mark them,' said aragorn. 'but i marked also that this old man had a hat not a hood. still i do not doubt that you guess right, and that we are in peril here, by night or day. yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but rest, while we may. i will watch for a while now, gimli. i have more need of thought than of sleep.'
the night passed slowly. legolas followed aragorn, and gimli followed legolas, and their watches wore away. but nothing happened. the old man did not appear again, and the horses did not return.

r the crest of the ridge now, and all song had ceased. night fell, and there was silence: nothing was to be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the ents, and a rustle, the shade of a whisper as of many drifting leaves. at last they stood upon the summit, and looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft at the end of the mountains: nan curunír, the valley of saruman.
'night lies over isengard,' said treebeard.

'my very bones are chilled,' said gimli, flapping his arms and stamping his feet. day had come at last. at dawn the companions had made such breakfast as they could; now in the growing light they were getting ready to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits.
'and do not forget that old man!' said gimli. 'i should be happier if i could see the print of a boot.'
'why would that make you happy?' said legolas.
'because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he seemed,' answered the dwarf.
'maybe,' said the e

lf; 'but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the grass is deep and springy.'
'that would not baffle a ranger,' said gimli. 'a bent blade is enough for aragorn to read. but i do not expect him to find any traces. it was an evil phantom of saruman that we saw last night. i am sure of it, even under the light of morning. his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now, maybe.'
'it is likely enough,' said aragorn; 'yet i am not sure. i am thinking of the horses. you said last night, gimli, that they were scared away. but i did not think so. did you hear them, legolas? did they sound to you like beasts in terror?'
'no,' said legolas. 'i heard them clearly. but for the darkness and our own fear i should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness. they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have long missed.'
'so i thought,' said aragorn; 'but i cannot read the riddle, unless they return. come! the light is growing fast. let us look first and

ttle had been fought. suddenly he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass. then he called to the others. they came running up.
'here at last we find news!' said aragorn. he lifted up a broken leaf for them to see, a large pale leaf of golden hue, now fading and turning brown. 'here is a mallorn-leaf of lórien, and there are small crumbs on it, and a few more crumbs in the grass. and see! there are some pieces of cut cord lying nearby!'
'and here is the knife that cut them!' said gimli. he stooped and drew out of a tussock, into which some heavy foot had trampled it, a short jagged blade. the haft from which it had been snapped was beside it. 'it was an orc-weapon,' he said, holding it gingerly, and looking with disgust at the carved handle: it had been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth.
'well, here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found!' exclaimed legolas. 'a bound prisoner escapes both from the orcs and from the surrounding horsemen.

legs were tied, how did he walk? and if his arms were tied, how did he use the knife? and if neither were tied, why did he cut the cords at all? being pleased with his skill, he then sat down and quietly ate some waybread! that at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. after that, i suppose, he turned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees. it should be easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!'
'there was sorcery here right enough,' said gimli. 'what was that old man doing? what have you to say, aragorn, to the reading of legolas. can you better it?'
'maybe, i could,' said aragorn, smiling. 'there are some other signs near at hand that you have not considered. i agree that the prisoner was a hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free, before he came here. i guess that it was hands, because the riddle then becomes easier, and also because, as i read the marks, he was carried to this point by an orc. blood was spilled there, a

to be wondered at that, when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen enemy, he rested and ate a little before he crept away. but it is a comfort to know that he had some lembas in his pocket, even though he ran away without gear or pack; that, perhaps, is like a hobbit. i say he, though i hope and guess that both merry and pippin were here together. there is, however, nothing to show that for certain.'
'and how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free?' asked gimli.
'i do not know how it happened,' answered aragorn. 'nor do i know why an orc was carrying them away. not to help them to escape, we may be sure. nay, rather i think that i now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why when boromir had fallen were the orcs content with the capture of merry and pippin? they did not seek out the rest of us, nor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed towards isengard. did they suppose they had captured the ring-bearer

kely enough with such folk; some large and bold orc may have been trying to escape with the prize alone, for his own ends. there, that is my tale. others might be devised. but on this we may count in any case: one at least of our friends escaped. it is our task to find him and help him before we return to rohan. we must not be daunted by fangorn, since need drove him into that dark place.'
'i do not know which daunts me more: fangorn, or the thought of the long road through rohan on foot,' said gimli.
'then let us go to the forest,' said aragorn.
it was not long before aragorn found fresh signs. at one point, near the bank of the entwash, he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints, but too light for much to be made of them. then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. the earth was bare and dry, and did not reveal much.
'one hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back; and then he turned away into the forest,' said aragorn.
'th

en we must go in, too,' said gimli. 'but i do not like the look of this fangorn: and we were warned against it. i wish the chase had led anywhere else!'
'i do not think the wood feels evil, whatever tales may say,' said legolas. he stood under the eaves of the forest, stooping forward, as if he were listening, and peering with wide eyes into the shadows. 'no, it is not evil; or what evil is in it is far away. i catch only the faintest echoes of dark places where the hearts of the trees are black. there is no malice near us; but

there is watchfulness, and anger.'
'well, it has no cause to be angry with me,' said gimli. 'i have done it no harm. '
'that is just as well,' said legolas. 'but nonetheless it has suffered harm. there is something happening inside, or going to happen. do you not feel the tenseness? it takes my breath.'
'i feel the air is stuffy,' said the dwarf. 'this wood is lighter than mirkwood, but it is musty and shabby.'
'it is old, very old,' said the elf. 'so old that almost i feel young again, as i have not felt since i journeyed with you children. it is old and full of memory. i could have

 been happy here, if i had come in days of peace.'
'i dare say you could,' snorted gimli. 'you are a wood-elf, anyway, though elves of any kind are strange folk. yet you comfort me. where you go, i will go. but keep your bow ready to hand, and i will keep my axe loose in my belt. not for use on trees,' he added hastily, looking up at the tree under which they stood. 'i do not wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready to hand, that is all. let us go!'
with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn. legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn.

overed with a drift of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks of the stream. so it was that he came upon the place where merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet. there plain for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other.
'this is good tidings,' said aragorn. 'yet the marks are two days old and it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water-side.'
'then what shall we do now?' said gimli. 'we cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fangorn. we have come ill supplied. if we do not find them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and show our friendship by starving together.'
'if that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,' said aragorn. 'let us go on.'

 was of any use. the shelf faced southward and eastward; but only on the east was the view open. there he could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards the plain from which they had come.
'we have journeyed a long way round,' said legolas. 'we could have all come here safe together, if we had left the great river on the second or third day and struck west. few can foresee whither their road will lead them, till they come to its end.'
'but we did not wish to come to fangorn,' said gimli.
'yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net,' said legolas. 'look!'
'look at what?' said gimli.
'there in the trees.'
'where? i have not elf-eyes.'
'hush! speak more softly! look!' said legolas pointing. 'down in the wood, back in the way that we have just come. it is he. cannot you see him, passing from tree to tree?'
'i see, i see now!' hissed gimli. 'look, aragorn! did i not warn you? there is the old man. all in dirty grey rags: that is why i could not see him at first.'
aragorn looked a

nd beheld a bent figure moving slowly. it was not far away. it looked like an old beggar-man, walking wearily, leaning on a rough staff. his head was bowed, and he did not look towards them. in other lands they would have greeted him with kind words; but now they stood silent, each feeling a strange expectancy: something was approaching that held a hidden power-or menace.
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while, as step by step the figure drew nearer. then suddenly, unable to contain himself longer, he burst out: 'your bow, legolas! bend it! get ready! it is saruman. do not let him speak, or put a spell upon us! shoot first!'
legolas took his bow and bent it, slowly and as if some other will resisted him. he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the string. aragorn stood silent, his face was watchful and intent.
'why are you waiting? what is the matte

r with you?' said gimli in a hissing whisper.
'legolas is right,' said aragorn quietly. 'we may not shoot an old man so, at unawares and unchallenged, whatever fear or doubt be on us. watch and wait!'
at that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surprising speed to the foot of the rock-wall. then suddenly he looked up, while they stood motionless looking down. there was no sound.
they could not see his face: he was hooded, and above the hood he wore a wide-brimmed hat, so that all his features were over

-shadowed, except for the end of his nose and his grey beard. yet it seemed to aragorn that he caught the gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows.
at last the old man broke the silence. 'well met indeed, my friends,' he said in a soft voice. 'i wish to speak to you. will you come down or shall i come up?' without waiting for an answer he began to climb.
'now!' said gimli. 'stop him, legolas!'
'did i not say that i wished to speak to you?' said the old man. 'put away that bow, master elf!'
the bow and arrow fell from legolas' hands, and his arms hung loose at his sides.
'and you, master dwarf, pray take your hand from your axe-haft, till i am up! you will not need such arguments.'
gimli started and then stood still as stone, staring, while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat. all weariness seemed to have left him. as he stepped up on to the

 shelf there was a gleam, too brief for certainty, a quick glint of white, as if some garment shrouded by the grey rags had been for an instant revealed the intake of gimli's breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silence.
'well met, i say again!' said the old man, coming towards them. when he was a few feet away, he stood, stooping over his staff, with his head thrust forward, peering at them from under his hood. 'and what may you be doing in these parts? an elf, a man, and a dwarf. all clad in elvish fashion. no doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all. such things are not often seen here.'
'you speak as one that knows fangorn well,' said aragorn.

e yesterday; and they met someone that they did not expect. does that comfort you? and now you would like to know where they were taken? well, well, maybe i can give you some news about that. but why are we standing? your errand, you see, is no longer as urgent as you thought. let us sit down and be more at ease.'
the old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones and rock at the foot of the cliff behind. immediately, as if a spell had been removed, the others relaxed and stirred. gimli's hand went at once to his axe-haft. aragorn drew his sword. legolas picked up his bow.
the old man took no notice, but stooped and sat himself on a low flat stone. then his grey cloak drew apart, and they saw, beyond doubt, that he was clothed beneath all in white.
'saruman!' cried gimli, springing towards him with axe in hand. 'speak! tell us where you have hidden our friends! what have you done with them? speak, or i will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it hard to deal w

ith!'
the old man was too quick for him. he sprang to his feet and leaped to the top of a large rock. there he stood, grown suddenly tall, towering above them. his hood and his grey rags were flung away. his white garments shone. he lifted up his staff, and gimli's axe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on the ground. the sword of aragorn, stiff in his motionless hand, blazed with a sudden fire. legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air: it vanished in a flash of flame.
'mithrandir!' he cried. 'mithrandir!'
'well met, i say to you again. legolas!' said the old man.
they all gazed at him. his hair was white as snow in the sunshine; and gleaming white was his robe; the eyes under his deep brows were bright, piercing as the rays of

 the sun; power was in his hand. between wonder, joy, and fear they stood and found no words to say.
at last aragorn stirred. 'gandalf!' he said. 'beyond all hope you return to us in our need! what veil was over my sight? gandalf!' gimli said nothing, hut sank to his knees, shading his eyes.
'gandalf,' the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long disused word. 'yes, that was the name. i was gandalf.'
he stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it about him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining, but now was hid in cloud again. 'yes, you may still call me gandalf,' he said, and the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide. 'get up, my good gimli! no blame to you, and no harm d

he laid his hand on gimli's head, and the dwarf looked up and laughed suddenly. 'gandalf!' he said. 'but you are all in white!'
'yes, i am white now,' said gandalf. 'indeed i am saruman, one might almost say, saruman as he should have been. but come now, tell me of yourselves! i have passed through fire and deep water, since we parted. i have forgotten much that i thought i knew, and learned again much that i had forgotten. i can see many things far off, but many things that are close at hand i cannot see. tell me of yo

'then you know about frodo!' said gimli. 'how do things go with him?'
'i cannot say. he was saved from a great peril, but many lie before him still. he resolved to go alone to mordor, and he set out: that is all that i can say.'
'not alone,' said legolas. 'we think that sam went with him.'
'did he!' said gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face. 'did he indeed? it is news to me, yet it does not surprise me. good! very good! you lighten my heart. you must tell me more. now sit by me and tell me the tale of you

 upon it like a storm.
'for already he knows that the messengers that he sent to waylay the company have failed again. they have not found the ring. neither have they brought away any hobbits as hostages. had they done even so much as that, it would have been a heavy blow to us, and it might have been fatal. but let us not darken our hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower. for the enemy has failed-so far. thanks to saruman:'
'then is not saruman a traitor?' said gimli.
'indeed yes,' said gandalf. 'doubly. and is not that strange? nothing that we have endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of isengard. even reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong. he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their help from minas tirith, even as the main blow is approaching from the east. yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand. saruman also had a mind to capture the ring, for himself, or at least to snare some hobbits for his

e otherwise they would never have come at all!
'also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their plans. no tidings of the battle will come to mordor, thanks to the horsemen of rohan; but the dark lord knows that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and borne away towards isengard against the will of his own servants. he now has isengard to fear as well as minas tirith. if minas tirith falls, it will go ill with saruman.'
'it is a pity that our friends lie in between,' said gimli. 'if no land divided isengard and mordor, then they could fight while we watched and waited.'
'the victor would emerge stronger than either, and free from doubt,' said gandalf. 'but isengard cannot fight mordor, unless saruman first obtains the ring. that he will never do now. he does not yet know his peril. there is much that he does not know. he was so eager to lay his hands on his prey that he could not wait at home, and he came forth to meet and to spy on his messengers. but he came too lat

s fled back to isengard to double and treble his assault on rohan. and all the time there is another danger, close at hand, which he does not see, busy with his fiery thoughts. he has forgotten treebeard.'
'now you speak to yourself again,' said aragorn with a smile. 'treebeard is not known to me. and i have guessed part of saruman's double treachery; yet i do not see in what way the coming of two hobbits to fangorn has served, save to give us a long and fruitless chase.'
'wait a minute!' cried gimli. 'there is another thing that i should like to know first. was it you, gandalf, or saruman that we saw last night?'
'you certainly did not see me,' answered gandalf, 'therefore i must guess that you saw saruman. evidently we look so much alike that your desire to make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused.'
'good, good!' said gimli. 'i am glad that it was not you.'
gandalf laughed again. 'yes, my good dwarf,' he said, 'it is a comfort not to be mistaken at all points. do i not know it onl

'but the hobbits!' legolas broke in. 'we have come far to seek them, and you seem to know where they are. where are they now?'
'with treebeard and the ents,' said gandalf.
'the ents!' exclaimed aragorn. 'then there is truth in the old legends about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees? are there still ents in the world? i thought they were only a memory of ancient days, if indeed

for he came here two days ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains. he often comes here, especially when his mind is uneasy, and rumours of the world outside trouble him. i saw him four days ago striding among the trees, and i think he saw me, for he paused; but i did not speak, for i was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle with the eye of mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.'
'perhaps he also thought that you were saruman,' said gimli. 'but you speak of him as if he was a friend. i thought fangorn was dangerous.'
'dangerous!' cried gandalf. 'and so am i, very dangerous: more dangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive before the seat of the dark lord. and aragorn is dangerous, and legolas is dangerous. you are beset with dangers, gimli son of glóin; for you are dangerous yourself, in your own fashion. certainly the forest of fangorn is perilous-not least to those that are too ready with their ax

he has passed through the fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. we will go where he leads.'
'yes, together we will follow you,' said legolas. 'but first, it would ease my heart, gandalf, to hear what befell you in moria. will you not tell us? can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered?'
'i have stayed already too long,' answered gandalf. 'time is short. but if there were a year to spend, i would not tell you all.'
'then tell us what you will, and time allows!' said gimli. 'come, gandalf, tell us how you fared with the balrog!'
'name him not!' said gandalf, and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face, and he sat silent, looking old as death. 'long time i fell,' he said at last, slowly, as if thinking back with difficulty. 'long i fell, and he fell with me. his fire was about me. i was burned. then we plunged into the deep water and all was dark. cold it was as the tide of death: almost it froze my heart.'
'deep is the abyss that is spann

'yet it has a bottom, beyond light and knowledge,' said gandalf. 'thither i came at last, to the uttermost foundations of stone. he was with me still. his fire was quenched, but now he was a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake.
'we fought far under the living earth, where time is not counted. ever he clutched me, and ever i hewed him, till at last he fled into dark tunnels. they were not made by durin's folk, gimli son of glóin. far, far below the deepest delving of the dwarves, the world is gnawed by nameless things. even sauron knows them not. they are older than he. now i have walked there, but i will bring no report to darken the light of day. in that despair my enemy was my only hope, and i pursued him, clutching at his heel. thus he brought me back at last to the secret ways of khazad-dûm: too well he knew them all. ever up now we went, until we came to the endless stair.'

gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes.
'then she sent me no message?' said gimli and bent his head.
'dark are her words,' said legolas, 'and little do they mean to those that receive them.'
'that is no comfort,' said gimli.
'what then?' said legolas. 'would you have her speak openly to you of your death?'
'yes. if she had nought else to say.'
'what is that?' said gandalf, opening his eyes. 'yes, i think i can guess what her words may mean. your pardon, gimli! i was pondering the messages once again. but indeed she sent words to you, and neither dark nor sad.

soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by, as if awaiting orders. 'we go at once to meduseld, the hall of your master, théoden,' said gandalf, addressing them gravely. they bowed their heads. 'time presses, so with your leave, my friends, we will ride. we beg you to use all the speed that you can. hasufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolas. i will set gimli before me, and by his leave shadowfax shall bear us both. we will wait now only to drink a little.'
'now i understand a part of last night's riddle,' said legolas as he sprang lightly upon arod's back. 'whether they fled at first in fear, or not, our horses met shadowfax, their chieftain, and greeted him with joy. did you know that he was at hand, gandalf?'
'yes, i knew,' said the wizard. 'i bent my thought upon him, bidding him to make haste; for yesterday he was far away in the south of this

'there lies the gap of rohan,' said gandalf. 'it is now almost due west of us. that way lies isengard.'

'battle and war!' said gandalf. 'ride on!'

chapter 6

the king of the golden hall

they rode on through sunset, and slow dusk, and gathering night. when at last they halted and dismounted, even aragorn was stiff and weary. gandalf only allowed them a few hours' rest. legolas and gimli slept and aragorn lay flat, stretched upon his back; but gandalf stood, leaning on his staff, gazing into the darkness, east and west. all was silent, and there was no sign or sound of living thing. the night was barred with long clouds, fleeting on a chill wind, when they arose again. under the cold moon they went on once more, as swift as by the light of day.
hours passed and still they rode on. gimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat, if gandalf had not clutched and shaken him. hasu

'yes, i will go,' he answered slowly. 'but what names shall i report? and what shall i say of you? old and weary you seem now, and yet you are fell and grim beneath, i deem'
'well do you see and speak,' said the wizard. 'for i am gandalf. i have returned. and behold! i too bring back a horse. here is shadowfax the great, whom no other hand can tame. and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn, the heir of kings, and it is to mundburg that he goes. here also are legolas the elf and gimli the dwarf, our comrades. go now and say to your master that we are at his gates and would have speech with him, if he will permit us to come into his hall.' 'strange names you give indeed! but i will report them as you bid and learn my master's will,' said the guard. 'wait here a little while, and f will bring you such answer as seems good to him. do not hope too much! these are dark days.' he went swiftly away, leaving the strangers in the watchful keeping of his comrades. after some time he r

'this is idle talk,' said gandalf. 'needless is théoden's demand, but it is useless to refuse. a king will have his way in his own hall, be it folly or wisdom.'
'truly,' said aragorn. 'and i would do as the master of the house bade me, were this only a woodman's cot, if i bore now any sword but andúril.'
'whatever its name may be,' said háma, 'here you shall lay it, if you would not fight alone against all the men in edoras.'
'not alone!' said gimli, fingering the blade of his axe, and looking darkly up at the guard, as if he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fell. 'not alone!'
'come, come!' said gandalf. 'we are all friends here. or should be; for the laughter of mordor will be our only reward, if we quarrel. my errand is pressing. here at least is my sword, goodman háma. keep it well. glamdring it is called, for the elves made it long ago. now let me pass. come, aragorn!'
slowly aragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set his sw

the guard stepped back and looked with amazement on aragorn. 'it seems that you are come on the wings of song out of the forgotten days he said. it shall be, lord, as you command.
'well,' said gimli, 'if it has andúril to keep it company, my axe may stay here, too, without shame'; and he laid it on the floor. 'now then, if all is as you wish, let us go and speak with your master.'
the guard still hesitated. 'your staff,' he said to gandalf. 'forgive me, but that too must be left at the doors.'
'foolishness!' said gandalf. 'prudence is one thing, but discourtesy is another. i am old. if i may not lean on my stick as i go, then i will sit out here, until it pleases théoden to hobble out hi

'then it is true, as éomer reported, that you are in league with the sorceress of the golden wood?' said wormtongue. 'it is not to be wondered at: webs of deceit were ever woven in dwimordene.'
gimli strode a pace forward, but felt suddenly the hand of gandalf clutch him by the shoulder, and he halted, standing stiff as stone.
in dwimordene, in lórien
seldom have walked the feet of men,
few mortal eyes have seen the light
that lies there ever, long and bright.
galadriel! galadriel!
clear is the water of your well;
white is the star in your white hand;
unmarred, unstained is leaf and land
in dwimordene, in lórien

now men came bearing raiment of war from the king's hoard and they arrayed aragorn and legolas in shining mail. helms too they chose, and round shields: their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems, green and red and white. gandalf took no armour; and gimli needed no coat of rings, even if one had been found to match his stature, for there was no hauberk in the hoards of edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath the mountain in the north. but he chose a cap of iron and leather that fitted well upon his round head; and a small shield he also took. it bore the running horse, white upon green, that was the emblem of the house of eorl.

gimli bowed. 'i am proud, lord of the mark, to bear your device,' he said. 'indeed sooner would i bear a horse than be borne by one. i love my feet better. but, maybe, i shall come yet where i can stand and fight.'
'it may well be so,' said théoden.
the king now rose, and at once éowyn came forward bearing wine. 'ferthu théoden hál!' she said. 'receive now this cup and drink in happy hour. health be with thee at thy going and coming!'
théoden drank from the cup, and she then proffered it to the

'the king shall come again,' he said. 'fear not! not west but east does our doom await us.'
the king now went down the stair with gandalf beside him. the others followed. aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate. alone éowyn stood before the doors of the house at the stair's head; the sword was set upright before her, and her hands were laid upon the hilt. she was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the sun.
gimli walked with legolas. his axe on his shoulder. 'well, at last we set off!' he said. 'men need many words before deeds. my axe is restless in my hands. though i doubt not that these rohirrim are fell-handed when they come to it. nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me. how shall i come to the battle? i wish i could walk and not bump like a sack at gandalf's saddlebow.'
'a safer seat than many, i guess,' said legolas. 'yet doubtless gandalf will gladly put you down on your feet when blow

'and a dwarf is no horseman. it is orc-necks i would hew, not shave the scalps of men,' said gimli, patting the haft of his axe.
at the gate they found a great host of men, old and young, all ready in the saddle. more than a thousand were there mustered. their spears were like a springing wood. loudly and joyously they shouted as théoden came forth. some held in readiness the king's horse, snowmane, and others held the horses of aragorn and legolas. gimli stood ill at ease, frowning, but éomer came up to him, leading his horse.
'hail, gimli glóin's son!' he cried. 'i have not had time to

'i will forget my wrath for a while, éomer son of éomund,' said gimli; 'but if ever you chance to see the lady galadriel with your eyes, then you shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies, or our friendship will end.' 'so be it!' said éomer. 'but until that time pardon me, and in token of pardon ride with me, i beg. gandalf will be at the head with the lord of the mark; but firefoot, my horse, will bear us both, if you will.'
'i thank you indeed,' said gimli greatly pleased. 'i will gladly go with you, if legolas, my comrade, may ride beside us.'

 top, sheltered by a parapet over which only a tall man could look. here and there were clefts in the stone through which men could shoot. this battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a door in the outer court of the hornburg; three flights of steps led also up on to the wall from the deep behind; but in front it was smooth, and the great stones of it were set with such skill that no foothold could be found at their joints, and at the top they hung over like a sea-delved cliff.
gimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall. legolas sat above on the parapet, fingering his bow, and peering out into the gloom.
'this is more to my liking,' said the dwarf, stamping on the stones. 'ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains. there is good rock here. this country has tough bones. i felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike. give me a year and a hundred of my kin and i would make this a place that armies would break upon like water.'

'but you are a dwarf, and dwarves are strange folk. i do not like this place, and i shall like it no more by the light of day. but you comfort me, gimli, and i am glad to have you standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe. i wish there were more of your kin among us. but even more would i give for a hundred good archers of mirkwood. we shall need them. the rohirrim have good bowmen after their fashion, but there are too few here, too few.'
'it is dark for archery,' said gimli. 'indeed it is time for sleep. sleep! i feel the need of it, as never i thought any dwarf could. riding is tiring work. yet my axe is restless in my hand. give me a row of orc-necks and room to swing and all weariness will fall from me!'
a slow time passed. far down in the valley scattered fires still burned. the hosts of isengard were advancing in silence now. their torches could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines.
suddenly from the dike yells and screams, and the fierce battle-cries o

elves to the ground at éomer's heels, tripped him, and in a moment they were on top of him. but a small dark figure that none had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout: baruk khazâd! khazâd ai-mênu! an axe swung and swept back. two orcs fell headless. the rest fled.
éomer struggled to his feet, even as aragorn ran back to his aid.
the postern was closed again, the iron door was barred and piled inside with stones. when all were safe within, éomer turned: 'i thank you, gimli son of glóin!' he said. 'i did not know that you were with us in the sortie. but oft the unbidden guest proves the best company. how came you there?'
'i followed you to shake off sleep,' said gimli; 'but i looked on the hillmen and they seemed over large for me, so i sat beside a stone to see your sword-play.'
'i shall not find it easy to repay you,' said éomer.
'there may be many a chance ere the night is over,' laughed the dwarf. 'but i am content. till now i have hewn naught but wood since

'two!' said gimli, patting his axe. he had returned to his place on the wall.
'two?' said legolas. 'i have done better, though now i must grope for spent arrows; all mine are gone. yet i make my tale twenty at the least. but that is only a few leaves in a forest.'
the sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly. but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark. the enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, still more were pressing up from the valley thro

ril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall.
then a clamour arose in the deep behind. orcs had crept like rats through the culvert through which the stream flowed out. there they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs, until the assault above was hottest and nearly all the men of the defence had rushed to the wall's top. then they sprang out. already some had passed into the jaws of the deep and were among the horses, fighting with the guards.
down from the wall leapt gimli with a fierce cry that echoed in the cliffs. 'khazâd! khazâd!' he soon had work enough.
'ai-oi!' he shouted. 'the orcs are behind the wall. ai-oi! come, legolas! there are enough for us both. khazâd ai-mênu!'
gamling the old looked down from the hornburg, hearing the great voice of the dwarf above all the tumult. 'the orcs are in the deep!' he cried. 'helm! helm! forth helmingas. he shouted as he leaped down the stair from the rock with many men of westfold at his back.

ce and sudden, and the orcs gave way before them. ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge, and all were slain or driven shrieking into the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardians of the hidden caves.
'twenty-one!' cried gimli. he hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the last orc before his feet. 'now my count passes master legolas again.'
'we must stop this rat-hole,' said gamling. 'dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stone. lend us your aid, master!'
'we do not shape stone with battle-axes, nor with our finger-nails,' said gimli. 'but i will help as i may.'
they gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find to hand, and under gimli's direction the westfold-men blocked up the inner end of the

culvert, until only a narrow outlet remained. then the deeping-stream, swollen by the rain, churned and fretted in its choked path, and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff.
'it will be drier above,' said gimli. 'come, gamling, let us see how things go on the wall!'
he climbed up and found legolas beside aragorn and éomer. the elf was whetting his long knife. there was for a while a lull in the assault, since the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled.
'twenty-one!' said gimli.
'good!' said legolas. 'but my count is now two dozen. it has been knife-work up here.'
éomer and aragorn leant wearily on their swords. away on the left the crash and clamour of the battle on the rock rose lo

, yelling, with their long arms stretched out to seize him. the foremost fell with legolas' last arrow in his throat. but the rest sprang over him. then a great boulder, cast from the outer wall above, crashed down upon the stair, and hurled them back into the deep. aragorn gained the door, and swiftly it clanged to behind him.
'things go ill, my friends,' he said, wiping the sweat from his brow with his arm.
'ill enough,' said legolas, 'but not yet hopeless, while we have you with us. where is gimli?'
'i do not know.' said aragorn. 'i last saw him fighting on the ground behind the wall, but the enemy swept us apart.'
'alas! that is evil news,' said legolas.
'he is stout and strong,' said aragorn. 'let us hope that he will escape back to the caves. there he would be safe for a while. safer than we. such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf.'
'that must be my hope'' said legolas. 'but i wish that he had come this way. i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty-nine.'

 the green grass beside the deeping-stream. there was also aragorn son of arathorn, and legolas the elf, and erkenbrand of westfold, and the lords of the golden house. about them were gathered the rohirrim, the riders of the mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and their eyes were turned towards the wood.
suddenly there was a great shout, and down from the dike came those who had been driven back into the deep. there came gamling the old, and éomer son of éomund, and beside them walked gimli the dwarf. he had no helm, and about his head was a linen band stained with blood; but his voice was loud and strong.
'forty-two, master legolas!' he cried. 'alas! my axe is notched: the forty-second had an iron collar on his neck. how is it with you?'
'you have passed my score by one,' answered legolas. 'but i do not grudge you the game, so glad am i to see you on your legs!'
'welcome, éomer, sister-son!' said théoden. 'now that i see you safe, i am glad indeed.'

t to a fight.'
the king then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses, and he sent them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the mark; and they bore his summons also, bidding all men, young and old, to come in haste to edoras. there the lord of the mark would hold an assembly of all that could bear arms, on the second day after the full moon. to ride with him to isengard the king chose éomer and twenty men of his household. with gandalf would go aragorn, and legolas, and gimli. in spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind.
'it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it;' he said. 'it would take more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back.'
'i will tend it, while you rest,' said aragorn.
the king now returned to the hornburg, and slept, such a sleep of quiet as he had not known for many years, and the remainder of his chosen company rested also. but the others, all that were not hurt or wounded, began a great labour; for many had fallen in the battle and l

 through it gandalf passed, and they followed him. then to their amazement they found that the road ran on, and the deeping-stream beside it; and the sky was open above and full of golden light. but on either side the great aisles of the wood were already wrapped in dusk, stretching away into impenetrable shadows; and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs, and far cries, and a rumour of wordless voices, murmuring angrily. no orc or other living creature could be seen.
legolas and gimli were now riding together upon one horse; and they kept close beside gandalf, for gimli was afraid of the wood.
'it is hot in here,' said legolas to gandalf. 'i feel a great wrath about me. do you not feel the air throb in your ears?'
'yes,' said gandalf.
'what has become of the miserable orcs?' said legolas.
'that, i think, no one will ever know,' said gandalf.
they rode in silence for a while; but legolas was ever glancing from side to side, and would often have halted to listen to the sounds

of the wood, if gimli had allowed it.
'these are the strangest trees that ever i saw,' he said; 'and i have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age. i wish that there were leisure now to walk among them: they have voices, and in time i might come to understand their thought.'
'no, no!' said gimli. 'let us leave them! i guess their thought already: hatred of all that go on two legs; and their speech is of crushing and strangling.'
'not of all that go on two legs,' said legolas. 'there i think you are wrong. it is orcs that they hate. for they do not belong here and know little of elves and men. far away are the valleys where they sprang. from the deep dales of fangorn, gimli, that is whence they come, i guess.'
'then that is the most perilous wood in middle-earth,' said gimli. 'i should

nd what do they say of it? caves, they say! caves! holes to fly to in time of war, to store fodder in! my good legolas, do you know that the caverns of helm's deep are vast and beautiful? there would be an endless pilgrimage of dwarves, merely to gaze at them, if such things were known to be. aye indeed, they would pay pure gold for a brief glance!'
'and i would give gold to be excused,' said legolas; 'and double to be let out, if i strayed in!'
'you have not seen, so i forgive your jest,' said gimli. 'but you speak like a fool. do you think those halls are fair, where your king dwells under the hill in mirkwood, and dwarves helped in their making long ago? they are but hovels compared with the caverns i have seen here: immeasurable halls, filled with an everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools, as fair as kheled-zâram in the starlight.

'then i will wish you this fortune for your comfort, gimli,' said the elf, 'that you may come safe from war and return to see them again. but do not tell all your kindred! there seems little left for them to do, from your account. maybe the men of this land are wise to say little: one family of busy dwarves with hammer and chisel might mar more than they made.'
'no, you do not understand,' said gimli. 'no dwarf could be unmoved by such loveliness. none of durin's race would mine those caves for stones or ore, not if diamonds and gold could be got there

y tap - a small chip of rock and no more, perhaps, in a whole anxious day - so we could work, and as the years went by, we should open up new ways, and display far chambers that are still dark, glimpsed only as a void beyond fissures in the rock. and lights, legolas! we should make lights, such lamps as once shone in khazad-dûm; and when we wished we would drive away the night that has lain there since the hills were made; and when we desired rest, we would let the night return.'
'you move me, gimli,' said legolas. 'i have never heard you speak like this before. almost you make me regret that i have not seen these caves. come! let us make this bargain-if we both return safe out of the perils that await us, we will journey for a while together. you shall visit fangorn with me, and then i will come with you to see helm's deep.'
'that would not be the way of return that i should choose,' said gimli. 'but i will endure fangorn, if i have your promise to come back to the caves and share their w

'you have my promise,' said legolas. 'but alas! now we must leave behind both cave and wood for a while: see! we are coming to the end of the trees. how far is it to isengard, gandalf?'
'about fifteen leagues, as the crows of saruman make it.' said gandalf: 'five from the mouth of deeping-coomb to the fords: and ten more from there to the gates of isengard. but we shall not ride all the way this night.'
'and when we come there, what shall we see?' asked gimli. 'you may know, but i cannot guess.'
'i do not know myself for certain,' answered the wizard. 'i was there at nightfall yesterday, but much may have happened since. yet i think that you will not say that the journey was in vain - not though the glittering caves of aglarond be left behind.'
at last the company passed through the trees, and found that they had come to the bottom of the coomb, where the road from helm's deep branched, going one way east to edoras, and the other north to the fords

of isen. as they rode from under the eaves of the wood, legolas halted and looked back with regret. then he gave a sudden cry.
'there are eyes!' he said. 'eyes looking out from the shadows of the boughs! i never saw such eyes before.'
the others, surprised by his cry, halted and turned; but legolas started to ride back.
'no, no!' cried gimli. 'do as you please in your madness, but let me first get down from this horse! i wish to see no eyes!' 'stay, legolas greenleaf!' said gandalf. 'do not go back into the wood, not yet! now is not your time.'
even as he spoke, there came forward out of the trees three strange shapes. as tall as trolls they were, twelve feet or more in height; their strong bodies, stout as young trees, seemed to be clad with raiment or with hide of close-fitting grey and brown. their limbs were long, and their han

ghed gandalf. 'and was it saruman that ordered you to guard his damaged doors, and watch for the arrival of guests, when your attention could be spared from plate and bottle?'
'no, good sir, the matter escaped him,' answered merry gravely 'he has been much occupied. our orders came from treebeard, who has taken over the management of isengard. he commanded me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting words. i have done my best.'
'and what about your companions? what about legolas and me?' cried gimli, unable to contain himself longer. 'you rascals, you woolly-footed and wool-pated truants! a fine hunt you have led us! two hundred leagues, through fen and forest, battle and death, to rescue you! and here we find you feasting and idling-and smoking! smoking! where did you come by the weed, you villains? hammer and tongs! i am so torn between rage and joy, that if i do not burst. it will be a marvel!'
'you speak for me, gimli,' laughed legolas. 'though i would sooner learn how they came by the

'one thing you have not found in your hunting, and that's brighter wits,' said pippin, opening an eye. 'here you find us sitting on a field of victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned comforts!'
'well-earned?' said gimli. 'i cannot believe that!'
the riders laughed. 'it cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting of dear friends,' said théoden. 'so these are the lost ones of your company, gandalf? the days are fated to be filled with marvels. already i have seen many since i left my house; and now here before my eyes stand yet another of the folk of legend. are not these the halflings, that some among us call the holbytlan?'
'hobbits, if you please, lord,' said pippin.
'hobbits?' said théoden. 'your tongue

the hobbits bowed low. 'so that is the king of rohan!' said pippin in an undertone. 'a fine old fellow. very polite.'

chapter 9

flotsam and jetsam

gandalf and the king's company rode away, turning eastward to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard. but aragorn, gimli, and legolas remained behind. leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass, they came and sat beside the hobbits.
'well, well! the hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where none of us ever thought to come,' said aragorn.
'and now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters,' said legolas, 'the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small riddles. we tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still many things that i should like to know the truth of.'
'and

 there is a great deal, too, that we want to know about you ' said merry. 'we have learnt a few things through treebeard, the old ent, but that is not nearly enough.'
'all in good time,' said legolas. 'we were the hunters, and you should give an account of yourselves to us first.'
'or second,' said gimli. 'it would go better after a meal. t have a sore head; and it is past mid-day. you truants might make amends by finding us some of the plunder that you spoke of. food and drink would pay off some of my score against you.'
'then you shall have it,' said pippin. 'will you have it here, or in more comfort in what's left of saruman's guard-house--over there under the arch? we had to picnic out here, so as to keep an eye on the road.'
'less than an eye!' said gimli. 'but i will not go into any orc-h

ouse nor touch orcs' meat or anything that they have mauled.'
'we wouldn't ask you to,' said merry. 'we have had enough of orcs ourselves to last a life-time. but there were many other folk in isengard. saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs. he had men to guard his gates: some of his most faithful servants, i suppose. anyway they were favoured and got good provisions.'
'and pipe-weed?' asked gimli.
'no, i don't think so,' merry laughed. 'but that is another story, which can wait until after lunch.'
'well let us go and have lunch then!' said the dwarf.
the hobbits led the way; and they passed under the arch and came to a wide door upon the left, at the top of a stair. it opened direct into a large chamber, with other smaller doors at the far end, and a hearth and chimney at one side. the chamber was hewn out of the stone; and it must once have been dark, for its windows looked out only in

aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long table, and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors. 'store-room in there, and above the woods, luckily,' said pippin, as they came back laden with dishes, bowls, cups, knives, and food of various sorts.
'and you need not turn up your nose at the provender, master gimli,' said merry. 'this is not orc-stuff, but man-food, as treebeard calls it. will you have wine or beer? there's a barrel inside there - very passable. and this is first-rate salted pork. or i can cut you some rashers of bacon and broil them, if you like. i am sorry there is no green stuff: the deliveries have been rather interrupted in the last few days! i cannot offer you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread. are you content?'
'indeed yes,' said gimli. 'the score is much reduc

e must keep our guests company,' they said.
'you are full of courtesy this morning,' laughed legolas. 'but maybe. if we had not arrived, you would already have been keeping one another company again.'
'maybe; and why not?' said pippin. 'we had foul fare with the orcs, and little enough for days before that. it seems a long while since we could eat to heart's content.'
'it does not seem to have done you any harm,' said aragorn. 'indeed you look in the bloom of health.'
'aye, you do indeed,' said gimli, looking them up and down over the top of his cup. 'why, your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted; and i would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for hobbits of your age. this treebeard at any rate has not starved you.'
'he has not,' said merry. 'but ents only drink, and drink is not enough for content. treebeard's draughts may be nourishing, but one feels the need of something solid. and even lembas is none the worse for a change.'
'you have drunk of th

'many strange tales have been told about that land,' said aragorn. 'i have never entered it. come, tell me more about it, and about the ents!'
'ents,' said pippin, 'ents are - well ents are all different for on thing. but their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.' he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence. 'oh, well,' he went on, 'you have seen some at a distance, already-they saw you at any ra

'now, now!' said gimli. 'we are beginning the story in the middle. i should like a tale in the right order, starting with that strange day when our fellowship was broken.'
'you shall have it, if there is time,' said merry. 'but first-if you have finished eating-you shall fill your pipes and light up. and then for a little while we can pretend that we are all back safe at bree again, or in rivendell.'
he produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. 'we have heaps of it,' he said; 'and you can all pack as much as you

wish, when we go. we did some salvage-work this morning, pippin and i. there are lots of things floating about. it was pippin who found two small barrels, washed up out of some cellar or store-house, i suppose. when we opened them, we found they were filled with this: as fine a pipe-weed as you could wish for, and quite unspoilt.'
gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it. 'it feels good, and it smells good,' he said.
'it is good!' said merry. 'my dear gimli, it is longbottom leaf! there were the hornblower brandmarks on the barrels, as plain as plain. how it came here, i can't imagine. for saruman's private use. i fancy. i never knew that it went so far abroad. but it comes in handy now?'
'it would,' said gimli, 'if i had a pipe to go with it. alas, i lost mine in moria, or before. is there no pipe in all your plunder?'
'no, i am afraid not,' said merry. 'we have not found any, not even here in the guardrooms. saruman kept this dainty to himself.

oment!' said pippin. putting his hand inside the breast of his jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string. 'i keep a treasure or two near my skin, as precious as rings to me. here's one: my old wooden pipe. and here's another: an unused one. i have carried it a long way,, though i don't know why. i never really expected to find any pipe-weed on the journey, when my own ran out. but now it comes in useful after all.' he held up a small pipe with a wide flattened bowl, and handed it to gimli. 'does that settle the score between us?' he said. 'settle it!' cried gimli. 'most noble hobbit, it leaves me deep in your debt.'
'well, i am going back into the open air, to see what the wind and sky are doing!' said legolas.
'we will come with you,' said aragorn.
they went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the gateway. they could see far down into the valley now; the mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze.
'now let us take our ease here for a little!' said a

k them from us. how he glared! at first i thought he was going to stab me, but he threw the things away as if they burned him.'
'and here also is your brooch, pippin,' said aragorn. 'i have kept it safe, for it is a very precious thing.'
'i know,' said pippin. 'it was a wrench to let it go; but what else could i do?'
'nothing else,' answered aragorn. 'one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters. you did rightly.'
'the cutting of the bands on your wrists, that was smart work!' said gimli. 'luck served you there; but you seized your chance with both hands, one might say.'
'and set us a pretty riddle,' said legolas. 'i wondered if you had grown wings!'
'unfortunately not,' said pippin. 'but you did not know about grishnákh.' he shuddered and said no more, leaving merry to tell of those last horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful strength of grishnákh's hairy arms.
'all this about the orcs of barad-dûr, lugbúrz as they call it, makes me uneasy,' s

aid aragorn. 'the dark lord already knew too much and his servants also; and grishnákh evidently sent some message across the river after the quarrel. the red eye will be looking towards isengard. but saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.'
'yes, whichever side wins, his outlook is poor,' said merry. 'things began to go all wrong for him from the moment his orcs set foot in rohan.'
'we caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so gandalf hints,' said gimli. 'on the edge of the forest.'
'when was that?' asked pippin.
'five nights ago,' said aragorn.
'let me see,' said merry: 'five nights ago-now we come to a part of the story you know nothing about. we met treebeard that morning after the battle; and that night we were at wellinghall, one of his ent-houses. the next morning we went to entmoot, a gathering of ents, that is, and the queerest thing i have ever seen in my life. it lasted all that day and the next; and we spent the nights with an ent c

 saruman is still in his tower. there was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley. i think the ents and huorns that had been away came back then; but where they have all gone to now, i don't know. it was a misty, moisty morning when we climbed down and looked round again, and nobody was about. and that is about all there is to tell. it seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoil. and safer too, somehow, since gandalf came back. i could sleep!'
they all fell silent for a while. gimli re-filled his pipe. 'there is one thing i wonder about,' he said as he lit it with his flint and tinder: 'wormtongue. you told théoden he was with saruman. how did he get there?'
'oh yes, i forgot about him,' said pippin. 'he did not get here till this morning. we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared again. we heard him hooming and calling our names outside.
'"i have just come round to see how you are faring, my lads,' he said; 'and to give you some news. huorns

the ents may have found time to brew some of their draughts from the mountain-springs, and we shall see gandalf's beard curling when he returns. after the ents had gone, we felt tired, and hungry. but we did not grumble - our labours had been well rewarded. it was through our search for man-food that pippin discovered the prize of all the flotsam, those hornblower barrels. "pipe-weed is better after food," said pippin; that is how the situation arose.'
'we understand it all perfectly now,' said gimli.
'all except one thing,' said aragorn: 'leaf from the southfarthing in isengard. the more i consider it, the more curious i find it. i have never been in isengard, but i have journeyed in this land, and i know well the empty countries that lie between rohan and the shire. neither goods nor folk have passed that way for many a long year, not openly. saruman had secret dealings with someone in the shire, i guess. wormtongues may be found in other houses than king théoden's. was there a date on t

pe you companions have all rested, too, and refreshed yourselves?'
'we have,' said merry. 'but our discussions began and ended in smoke. still we feel less ill-disposed towards saruman than we did.'
'do you indeed?' said gandalf. 'well, i do not. i have now a last task to do before i go: i must pay saruman a farewell visit. dangerous, and probably useless; but it must be done. those of you who wish may come with me - but beware! and do not jest! this is not the time for it.'
'i will come,' said gimli. 'i wish to see him and learn if he really looks like you.'
'and how will you learn that, master dwarf?' said gandalf. 'saruman could look like me in your eyes, if it suited his purpose with you. and are you yet wise enough to detect all his counterfeits? well, we shall see, perhaps. he may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes together. but i have ordered all the ents to remove themselves from sight, so perhaps we shall persuade him to come out.'
'what's the danger?' asked pippi

and the king dismounted. 'i will go up,' said gandalf. 'i have been in orthanc and i know my peril.'
'and i too will go up,' said the king. 'i am old, and fear no peril any more. i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong. éomer shall come with me, and see that my aged feet do not falter.'
'as you will,' said gandalf. 'aragorn shall come with me. let the others await us at the foot of the stairs. they will hear and see enough, if there is anything to hear or see.'
'nay!' said gimli. 'legolas and i wish for a closer view. we alone here represent our kindred. we also will come behind.'
'come then!' said gandalf, and with that he climbed the steps, and théoden went beside him.
the riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses, on either side of the stair, and looked up darkly at the great tower, fearing what might befall their lord. merry and pippin sat on the bottom step, feeling both unimportant and unsafe.
'half a sticky mile from here to the gate!' muttered pippin. 'i

ming; and they saw a figure standing at the rail, looking down upon them: an old man, swathed in a great cloak, the colour of which was not easy to tell, for it changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred. his face was long, with a high forehead, he had deep darkling eyes, hard to fathom, though the look that they now bore was grave and benevolent, and a little weary. his hair and beard were white, but strands of black still showed about his lips and ears.
'like, and yet unlike,' muttered gimli.
'but come now,' said the soft voice. 'two at least of you i know by name. gandalf i know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or counsel here. but you, théoden lord of the mark of rohan are declared by your noble devices, and still more by the fair countenance of the house of eorl. o worthy son of thengel the thrice-renowned! why have you not come before, and as a friend? much have i desired to see you, mightiest king of western lands, and especially in these latter years, to save yo

pproval of the words of saruman; and then they too were silent, as men spell-bound. it seemed to them that gandalf had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord. rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with théoden. and over their hearts crept a shadow, the fear of a great danger: the end of the mark in a darkness to which gandalf was driving them, while saruman stood beside a door of escape, holding it half open so that a ray of light came through. there was a heavy silence.
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly. 'the words of this wizard stand on their heads,' he growled, gripping the handle of his axe. 'in the language of orthanc help means ruin, and saving means slaying, that is plain. but we do not come here to beg.'
'peace!' said saruman, and for a fleeting moment his voice was less suave, and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone. 'i do not speak to you yet, gimli glóin's son,' he said. 'far away is your home and small concern of yours are the troubles of thi

ut of orthanc alive, it will be more than he deserves.
'here, my lad, i'll take that! i did not ask you to handle it,' he cried, turning sharply and seeing pippin coming up the steps, slowly, as if he were bearing a great weight. he went down to meet him and hastily took the dark globe from the hobbit, wrapping it in the folds of his cloak. 'i will take care of this,' he said. 'it is not a thing, i guess, that saruman would have chosen to cast away.'
'but he may have other things to cast,' said gimli. 'if that is the end of the debate, let us go out of stone's throw, at least!'
'it is the end,' said gandalf. 'let us go.'
they turned their backs on the doors of orthanc, and went down. the riders hailed the king with joy, and saluted gandalf. the spell of saruman was broken: they had seen him come at call, and crawl away, dismissed.
'well, that is done,' said gandalf. 'now i must find treebeard and tell him how things have gone.'
'he will have guessed, surely?' said merry. 'were they likely t

a shrill shriek; suddenly cut off, came from an open window high above.
'it seems that saruman thinks so too,' said gandalf. 'let us leave them!'
they returned now to the ruins of the gate. hardly had they passed out under the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled stones where they had stood, treebeard and a dozen other ents came striding up. aragorn, gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder.
'here are three of my companions, treebeard,' said gandalf. 'i have spoken of them, but you have not yet seen them.' he named them one by one.
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly, and spoke to them in turn. last he turned to legolas. 'so you have come all the way from mirkwood, my good elf? a very great forest it used to be!'
'and still is,' said legolas. 'but not so great that we who dwell there ever tire of seeing new trees. i should dearly lov

ourney in fangorn's wood. i scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and i did not wish to turn back.'
treebeard's eyes gleamed with pleasure. 'i hope you may have your wish, ere the hills be much older,' he said.
'i will come, if i have the fortune,' said legolas. 'i have made a bargain with my friend that, if all goes well, we will visit fangorn together - by your leave.'
'any elf that comes with you will be welcome,' said treebeard.
'the friend i speak of is not an elf,' said legolas; 'i mean gimli, glóin's son here.' gimli bowed low, and the axe slipped from his belt and clattered on the ground.
'hoom, hm! ah now,' said treebeard, looking dark-eyed at him. 'a dwarf and an axe-bearer! hoom! i have good will to elves; but you ask much. this is a strange friendship!' 'strange it may seem,' said legolas; 'but while gimli lives i shall not come to fangorn alone. his axe is not for trees, but for orc-necks, o fangorn, master of fangorn's wood. forty-two he hewed in the battle.'
'hoo! come now

r. and so we fly - not from danger but into greater danger. every stride of shadowfax bears you nearer to the land of shadow, peregrin took.'
pippin made no answer, but clutched his cloak, as if a sudden chill had struck him. grey land passed under them.
'see now!' said gandalf. 'the westfold dales are opening before us. here we come back to the eastward road. the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the deeping-coomb. that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves. do not ask me about them. ask gimli, if you meet again, and for the first time you may get an answer longer than you wish. you will not see the caves yourself, not on this journey. soon they will be far behind.'
'i thought you were going to stop at helm's deep!' said pippin. 'where are you going then?'
'to minas tirith, before the seas of war surround it.'
'oh! and how far is that?'
'leagues upon leagues,' answered gandalf. 'thrice as far as the dwellings of king théoden, and they are more than a hundred miles east from here, as

'here, alas! i must do you a discourtesy,' said faramir. "i hope you will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as not to slay you or to bind you. but it is a command that no stranger, not even one of rohan that fights with us, shall see the path we now go with open eyes. i must blindfold you.'
`as you will,' said frodo. 'even the elves do likewise at need, and blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair lothlórien. gimli the dwarf took it ill, but the hobbits endured it.'
`it is to no place so fair that i shall lead you,' said faramir. 'but i am glad that you will take this willingly and not by force.'
he called softly and immediately mablung and damrod stepped out of the trees and came back to him. 'blindfold these guests,' said faramir. `securely, but not so as to discomfort them. do not tie their hands. they will give their word not to try and see. i could trust them to shut their eyes of their own accord, b
