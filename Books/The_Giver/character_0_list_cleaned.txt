[CHARACTER] - 
                	the
eleven-year-old protagonist of the giver. sensitive and
intelligent, with strange powers of perception that he doesn't understand,
[CHARACTER] is chosen to be the new receiver of memory for his community
when he turns twelve. even before his training, [CHARACTER] is unusually thoughtful,
expresses great concern for his friends and family, and thinks it
would be nice to be closer to other people. after his training begins,
[CHARACTER]'s universe widens dramatically. his new awareness of strong emotions,
beautiful colors, and great suffering makes him extremely passionate
about the world around him and the welfare of the people he loves,
though on the whole he remains level-headed and thoughtful.
