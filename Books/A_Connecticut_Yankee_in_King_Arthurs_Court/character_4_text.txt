the same suffering look that was in the page’s face was observable
in all the faces around--the look of dumb creatures who know that
they must endure and make no moan.

“marry, we shall have it again,” sighed the boy; “that same old
weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words,
and that he _will_ tell till he dieth, every time he hath gotten his
barrel full and feeleth his exaggeration-mill a-working.  would
god i had died or i saw this day!”

“who is it?”

“merlin, the mighty liar and magician, perdition singe him for
the weariness he worketh with his one tale!  but that men fear
him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the
devils that be in hell at his beck and call, they would have dug
his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and
squelch it.  he telleth it always in the third person, making
believe he is too modest to glorify himself--maledictions light

music; the flies buzzed and bit, unmolested, the rats swarmed
softly out from a hundred holes, and pattered about, and made
themselves at home everywhere; and one of them sat up like a
squirrel on the king’s head and held a bit of cheese in its hands
and nibbled it, and dribbled the crumbs in the king’s face with
naive and impudent irreverence.  it was a tranquil scene, and
restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit.

this was the old man’s tale.  he said:

“right so the king and merlin departed, and went until an hermit
that was a good man and a great leech.  so the hermit searched
all his wounds and gave him good salves; so the king was there
three days, and then were his wounds well amended that he might
ride and go, and so departed.  and as they rode, arthur said,
i have no sword.  no force,* [*footnote from m.t.: no matter.]
said merlin, hereby is a sword that shall be yours and i may.
so they rode till they came to a lake, the which was a fair water
and broad, and in the

 midst of the lake arthur was ware of an arm
clothed in white samite, that held a fair sword in that hand.
lo, said merlin, yonder is that sword that i spake of.  with that
they saw a damsel going upon the lake.  what damsel is that?
said arthur.  that is the lady of the lake, said merlin; and within
that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on earth,
and richly beseen, and this damsel will come to you anon, and then
speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword.  anon
withal came the damsel unto arthur and saluted him, and he her
again.  damsel, said arthur, what sword is that, that yonder
the arm holdeth above the water?  i would it were mine, for i have
no sword.  sir arthur king, said the damsel, that sword is mine,
and if ye will give me a gift whe

n i ask it you, ye shall have it.
by my faith, said arthur, i will give you what gift ye will ask.
well, said the damsel, go ye into yonder barge and row yourself
to the sword, and take it and the scabbard with you, and i will ask
my gift when i see my time.  so sir arthur and merlin alight, and
tied their horses to two trees, and so they went into the ship,
and when they came to the sword that the hand held, sir arthur
took it up by the handles, and took it with him.  and the arm
and the hand went under the water; and so they came unto the land
and rode forth.  and then sir arthur saw a rich pavilion.  what
signifieth yonder pavilion?  it is the knight’s pavilion, said
merlin, that ye fought with last, sir pellinore, but he is out,
he is not there; he hath ado with a kni

ght of yours, that hight
egglame, and they have fought together, but at the last egglame

is well said, said arthur, now have i a sword, now will i wage
battle with him, and be avenged on him.  sir, ye shall not so,
said merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing, so
that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also, he will
not lightly be matched of one knight living; and therefore it is my
counsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good service in short
time, and his sons, after his days.  also ye shall see that day
in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister
to wed.  when i see him, i will do as ye advise me, said arthur.
then sir arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passin

whether liketh you better, said merlin, the sword or the scabbard?
me liketh better the sword, said arthur.  ye are more unwise,
said merlin, for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword, for while
ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood, be ye
never so sore wounded; therefore, keep well the scabbard always
with you.  so they rode into carlion, and by the way they met with
sir pellinore; but merlin had done such a craft that pellinore saw
not arthur, and he passed by without any words.  i marvel, said
arthur, that the knight would not speak.  sir, said merlin, he saw
you not; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed.  so
they came unto carlion, whereof his knights were passing glad.
and when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would
jeopard his person so alone.  but all men of worship said it was
merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in

had allowed the characters to speak for themselves?  we should
have had talk from rebecca and ivanhoe and the soft lady rowena
which would embarrass a tramp in our day.  however, to the
unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate.  king arthur’s
people were not aware that they were indecent and i had presence
of mind enough not to mention it.

they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were
mightily relieved, at last, when old merlin swept the difficulty
away for them with a common-sense hint.  he asked them why they
were so dull--why didn’t it occur to them to strip me.  in half a
minute i was as naked as a pair of tongs!  and dear, dear, to think
of it: i was the only embarrassed person there.  everybody discussed
me; and did it as unconcernedly as if i had been a cabbage.
queen guenever was as naively interested as the rest, and said
she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before.  it was

“come, come, be brave, be a man--speak out, there’s a good lad!”

he hesitated, pulled one way by desire, the other way by fear;
then he stole to the door and peeped out, listening; and finally
crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his
fearful news in a whisper, and with all the cowering apprehension
of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things
whose very mention might be freighted with death.

“merlin, in his malice, has woven a spell about this dungeon, and
there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate
enough to essay to cross its lines with you!  now god pity me,
i have told it!  ah, be kind to me, be merciful to a poor boy who
means thee well; for an thou betray me i am lost!”

i laughed the only really refreshing laugh i had had for some time;
and shouted:

“merlin has wrought a spell!  _merlin_, forsooth!  that cheap old
humbug, that maundering old ass?  bosh, pu

but clarence had slumped to his knees before i had half finished,
and he was like to go out of his mind with fright.

“oh, beware!  these are awful words!  any moment these walls
may crumble upon us if you say such things.  oh call them back
before it is too late!”

now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to
thinking.  if everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely
afraid of merlin’s pretended magic as clarence was, certainly
a superior man like me ought to

“no--but for our blessed lady’s sake, do it no more.”

“well, i’ll tell you why i laughed.  because i’m a magician myself.”

“thou!”  the boy recoiled a step, and caught his breath, for
the thing hit him rather sudden; but the aspect which he took
on was very, very respectful.  i took quick note of that; it
indicated that a humbug didn’t need to have a reputation in this
asylum; people stood ready to take him at his word, without that.
i resumed.

“i’ve known merlin seven hundred years, and he--”

“seven hun--”

“don’t interrupt me.  he has died and come alive again thirteen
times, and traveled under a new name every time: smith, jones,
robinson, jackson, peters, haskins, merlin--a new alias every
time he turns up.  i knew him in egypt three hundred years ago;
i knew him in india five hundred years ago--he is always blethering
around in my way, everywhere i go; he makes me tired.  he don’t
amount to shucks, as a magician; knows some of the old

years ahead of those parties.

clarence came in, subdued, distressed, and said:

“i hasted the message to our liege the king, and straightway he
had me to his presence.  he was frighted even to the marrow,
and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement, and
that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so
great; but then came merlin and spoiled all; for he persuaded
the king that you are mad, and know not whereof you speak; and
said your threat is but foolishness and idle vaporing.  they
disputed long, but in the end, merlin, scoffing, said, ‘wherefore
hath he not _named_ his brave calamity?  verily it is because he
cannot.’  this thrust did in a most sudden sort close the king’s
mouth, and he could offer naught to turn the argument; and so,
reluctant, and full loth to do you the discourtesy, he yet prayeth
you to co

 disk, my heart beat higher and higher, and still the
assemblage and the priest stared into the sky, motionless.  i knew
that this gaze would be turned upon me, next.  when it was, i was
ready.  i was in one of the most grand attitudes i ever struck,
with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun.  it was a noble
effect.  you could _see_ the shudder sweep the mass like a wave.
two shouts rang out, one close upon the heels of the other:

“apply the torch!”

“i forbid it!”

the one was from merlin, the other from the king.  merlin started
from his place--to apply the torch himself, i judged.  i said:

“stay where you are.  if any man moves--even the king--before
i give him leave, i will blast him with thunder, i will consume
him with lightnings!”

the multitude sank meekly into their seats, and i was just expecting
they would.  merlin hesitated a moment or two, and i was on pins
and needles during that little while.  then he sat down, and i took
a good breath; for i knew i was master

 up my hands--stood just so a moment--then i said, with
the most awful solemnity: “let the enchantment dissolve and
pass harmless away!”

there was no response, for a moment, in that deep darkness and
that graveyard hush.  but when the silver rim of the sun pushed
itself out, a moment or two later, the assemblage broke loose with
a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me
with blessings and gratitude; and clarence was not the last of
the wash, to be sure.



chapter vii

merlin’s tower

inasmuch as i was now the second personage in the kingdom, as far
as political power and authority were concerned, much was made
of me.  my raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold,
and by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable.  but habit
would soon reconcile me to my clothes; i was aware of that.  i was
given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, after
the king’s.  they were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings,
but the stone floors had nothing but

minor interest and notoriety.  within twenty-four hours the
delegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight
they kept coming.  the village was crowded, and all the countryside.
i had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these
reverent and awe-stricken multitudes.  it came to be a great burden,
as to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time
compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center
of homage.  it turned brer merlin green with envy and spite, which
was a great satisfaction to me.  but there was one thing i couldn’t
understand--nobody had asked for an autograph.  i spoke to clarence
about it.  by george!  i had to explain to him what it was.  then
he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen
priests.  land! think of that.

there was another thing that troubled me a little.  those multitudes
presently began to agitate for another miracle.  that was natural.

t it was too far away.  two years.  i would have given a good
deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was
a big market for it.  it seemed a great pity to have it wasted so,
and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn’t have any
use for it, as like as not.  if it had been booked for only a month
away, i could have sold it short; but, as matters stood, i couldn’t
seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good, so i gave up
trying.  next, clarence found that old merlin was making himself
busy on the sly among those people.  he was spreading a report that
i was a humbug, and that the reason i didn’t accommodate the people
with a miracle was because i couldn’t.  i saw that i must do
something.  i presently thought out a plan.

by my authority as executive i threw merlin into prison--the same
cell i had occupied myself.  then i gave public notice by herald
and trumpet that i should be busy with affairs of state for
a fortnight, but about the end of that time

leisure and blow up merlin’s stone tower by fires from heaven;
in the meantime, whoso listened to evil reports about me, let him

this time, and no more; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured,
i would turn the murmurers into horses, and make them useful.
quiet ensued.

i took clarence into my confidence, to a certain degree, and we
went to work privately.  i told him that this was a sort of miracle
that required a trifle of preparation, and that it would b

and watched the weather.  clarence dropped in from time to time
and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the
time, and the whole country filling up with human masses as far
as one could see from the battlements.  at last the wind sprang up
and a cloud appeared--in the right quarter, too, and just at
nightfall.  for a little while i watched that distant cloud spread
and blacken, then i judged it was time for me to appear.  i ordered
the torch-baskets to be lit, and merlin liberated and sent to me.
a quarter of an hour later i ascended the parapet and there found
the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness
toward merlin’s tower.  already the darkness was so heavy that
one could not see far; these people and the old turrets, being
partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great
torch-baskets overhead, made a good deal of a picture.

merlin arrived in a gloomy mood.  i said:

“you wanted to burn me alive when i had not done y

masonry the rest of the week.  this was the report; but probably
the facts would have modified it.

it was an effective miracle.  the great bothersome temporary
population vanished.  there were a good many thousand tracks
in the mud the next morning, but they were all outward bound.
if i had advertised another miracle i couldn’t have raised an
audience with a sheriff.

merlin’s stock was flat.  the king wanted to stop his wages; he
even wanted to banish him, but i interfered.  i said he would be
useful to work the weather, and attend to small matters like that,
and i would give him a lift now and then when his poor little
parlor-magic soured on him.  there wasn’t a rag of his tower left,
but i had the government rebuild it for him, and advised him
to take boarders; but he was too high-toned for that.  and as for
being grateful, he never even said thank you.  he

and this was one of the spots.

the effect upon madame was electrical.  it cleared her countenance
and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and
blandishments; but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up
with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright. she said:

“la, but do list to thine handmaid! as if one gifted with powers
like to mine might say the thing which i have said unto one who
has vanquished merlin, and not be jesting.  by mine enchantments
i foresaw your coming, and by them i knew you when you entered
here.  i did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you
into some display of your art, as not doubting you would blast
the guards with occult fires, consuming them to ashes on the spot,
a marvel much beyond mine own ability, yet one which i have long
been childishly curious to see.”

the guards were less curious, and got out as soon as they got permission.

ribe it in words.  the fount is these nine days dry.
the prayers that did begin then, and the lamentations in sackcloth
and ashes, and the holy processions, none of these have ceased
nor night nor day; and so the monks and the nuns and the foundlings
be all exhausted, and do hang up prayers writ upon parchment,
sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice.  and at last
they sent for thee, sir boss, to try magic and enchantment; and
if you could not come, then was the messenger to fetch merlin,
and he is there these three days now, and saith he will fetch that
water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish
it; and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his
hellions to hie them hither and help, but not a whiff of moisture
hath he started yet, even so much as might qualify as mist upon
a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he sweateth
betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task; and if ye--”

“delay not, son, but get to thy saving work.  an we bring not
the water back again, and soon, we are ruined, and the good work
of two hundred years must end.  and see thou do it with enchantments
that be holy, for the church will not endure that work in her cause
be done by devil’s magic.”

“when i work, father, be sure there will be no devil’s work
connected with it.  i shall use no arts that come of the devil,
and no elements not created by the hand of god.  but is merlin
working strictly on pious lines?”

“ah, he said he would, my son, he said he would, and took oath
to make his promise good.”

“well, in that case, let him proceed.”

“but surely you will not sit idle by, but help?”

“it will not answer to mix methods, father; neither would it be
professional courtesy.  two of a trade must not underbid each
other.  we might as well cut rates and be done with it; it would
arrive at that in the end.  merlin has the contract; no other
magician can t

ch it till he throws it up.”

“but i will take it from him; it is a terrible emergency and the
act is thereby justified.  and if it were not so, who will give
law to the church?  the church giveth law to all; and what she
wills to do, that she may do, hurt whom it may.  i will take it
from him; you shall begin upon the moment.”

“it may not be, father.  no doubt, as you say, where power is
supreme, one can do as one likes and suffer no injury; but we poor
magicians are not so situated.  merlin is a very good magician
in a small way, and has quite a neat provincial reputation.  he
is struggling along, doing the best he can, and it would not be
etiquette for me to take his job until he himself abandons it.”

the abbot’s face lighted.

“ah, that is simple.  there are ways to persuade him to abandon it.”

“no-no, father, it skills not, as these people say.  if he were
persuaded against his will, he would load that well with a malicious
enchantment which would balk me until i fo

“a month!  the mere thought of it maketh me to shudder.  have it

leave me, and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting,
even as i have done these ten long days, counterfeiting thus
the thing that is called rest, the prone body making outward sign
of repose where inwardly is none.”

of course, it would have been best, all round, for merlin to waive
etiquette and quit and call it half a day, since he would never be
able to start that water, for he was a true magician of the time;
which is to say, the big miracles, the ones that gave him his
reputation, always had the luck to be performed when nobody but
merlin was present; he couldn’t start this well with all this crowd
around to see; a crowd was as bad for a magician’s miracle in
that day as it was for a spiritualist’s miracle in mine; there was
sure to be some skeptic on h

and to turn up the gas at the crucial
moment and spoil everything.  but i did not want merlin to retire
from the job until i was ready to take hold of it effectively
myself; and i could not do that until i got my things from camelot,
and that would take two or three days.

my presence gave the monks hope, and cheered them up a good deal;
insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time
in ten days.  as soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced
with food, their spirits began to rise fast; when the mead began to
go round they rose faster.  by the time everybody

; but the fifth time i told it, they began to crack in places;
the eight time i told it, they began to crumble; at the twelfth
repetition they fell apart in chunks; and at the fifteenth they
disintegrated, and i got a broom and swept them up.  this language
is figurative.  those islanders--well, they are slow pay at first,
in the matter of return for your investment of effort, but in the end
they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast.

i was at the well next day betimes.  merlin was there, enchanting
away like a beaver, but not raising the moisture.  he was not in
a pleasant humor; and every time i hinted that perhaps this contract
was a shade too hefty for a novice he unlimbered his tongue and
cursed like a bishop--french bishop of the regency days, i mean.

matters were about as i expected to find them.  the “fountain” was
an ordinary well, it had been dug in the ordinary way, and stoned up
in the ordinary way.  there was no miracle about it.  even the lie

ig fissure.

i almost regretted that my theory about the well’s trouble was
correct, because i had another one that had a showy point or two
about it for a miracle.  i remembered that in america, many
centuries later, when an oil well ceased to flow, they used to
blast it out with a dynamite torpedo.  if i should find this well
dry and no explanation of it, i could astonish these people most
nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite
bomb into it.  it was my idea to appoint merlin.  however, it was
plain that there was no occasion for the bomb.  one cannot have
everything the way he would like it.  a man has no business to
be depressed by a disappointment, anyway; he ought to make up his
mind to get even.  that is what i did.  i said to myself, i am in no
hurry, i can wait; that bomb will come good yet.  and it did, too.

when i was above ground again, i turned out the monks, and let down
a fish-line; the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep, and there

er have thought to drop
a fish-line into the well or go down in it and find out what was
really the matter.  old habit of mind is one of the toughest things
to get away from in the world.  it transmits itself like physical
form and feature; and for a man, in those days, to have had an idea
that his ancestors hadn’t had, would have brought him under suspicion
of being illegitimate.  i said to the monk:

“it is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well, but we
will try, if my brother merlin fails.  brother merlin is a very
passable artist, but only in the parlor-magic line, and he may
not succeed; in fact, is not likely to succeed.  but that should
be nothing to his discredit; the man that can do _this_ kind of
miracle knows enough to keep hotel.”

“hotel?  i mind not to have heard--”

“of hotel?  it’s what you call hostel.  the man that can do this

chapter xxiii

restoration of the fountain

saturday noon i went to the well and looked on a while.  merlin
was still burning smoke-powders, and pawing the air, and muttering
gibberish as hard as ever, but looking pretty down-hearted, for
of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet.
finally i said:

“how does the thing promise by this time, partner?”

“behold, i am even now busied with trial of the powerfulest
enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands
of the east; an it fail me, naught can avail.  peace, until i finish.”

he raised a smoke this tim

r their dens in a dense and
billowy fog.  he poured out volumes of speech to match, and contorted
his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary
way.  at the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting, and
about exhausted.  now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks
and nuns, and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of
acres of foundlings, all drawn by the prodigious smoke, and all
in a grand state of excitement.  the abbot inquired anxiously for
results.  merlin said:

“if any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these
waters, this which i have but just essayed had done it.  it has
failed; whereby i do now know that that which i had feared is
a truth established; the sign of this failure is, that the most
potent spirit known to the magicians of the east, and whose name
none may utter and live, has laid his spell upon this well.  the
mortal does not breathe, nor ever will, who can penetrate the secret
of that spell, and without that secret

e: i want the well
and the surroundings for the space of half a mile, entirely to
myself from sunset to-day until i remove the ban--and nobody
allowed to cross the ground but by my authority.”

“are these all?”

“yes.”

“and you have no fear to try?”

“oh, none.  one may fail, of course; and one may also succeed.
one can try, and i am ready to chance it.  i have my conditions?”

“these and all others ye may name.  i will issue commandment
to that effect.”

“wait,” said merlin, with an evil smile.  “ye wit that he that
would break this spell must know that spirit’s name?”

“yes, i know his name.”

“and wit you also that to know it skills not of itself, but ye
must likewise pronounce it?  ha-ha!  knew ye that?”

“yes, i knew that, too.”

“you had that knowledge!  art a fool?  are ye minded to utter
that name and die?”

“utter it?  why certainly.  i would utter it if it was welsh.”

“ye are even a dead man, then; and i go to tell arthur.”

“that’s all right.  take your gripsack and get along.  the thing
for _you_ to do is to go home and work the weather, john w. merlin.”

it was a home shot, and it made him wince; for he was the worst
weather-failure in the kingdom.  whenever he ordered up the
danger-signals along the coast there was a week’s dead calm, sure,
and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained brickbats.
but i kept him in the weather bureau right along, to undermine
his reputation.  however, that shot raised his bile, and instead
of starting home to report my death, he said he would remain
and enjoy it.

all the region which was under my ban must be clear; the bells
would then cease from tolling, and this sign should be permission
to the multitudes to close in and take their places.

i was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the
abbot’s solemn procession hove in sight--which it did not do till
it was nearly to the rope fence, because it was a starless black
night and no torches permitted.  with it came merlin, and took
a front seat on the platform; he was as good as his word for once.
one could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban,
but they were there, just the same.  the moment the bells stopped,
those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast
black wave, and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow,
and then it solidified itself, and you could have walked upon
a pavement of human heads to--well, miles.

we had a solemn stage-wait, now, for about twenty minute

just as i was moaning out the closing hunks of that word, i touched
off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of
people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare!  it was immense
--that effect!  lots of people shrieked, women curled up and quit
in every direction, foundlings collapsed by platoons.  the abbot
and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered
with agitated prayers.  merlin held his grip, but he was astonished
clear down to his corns; he had never seen anything to begin
with that, before.  now was the time to pile in the effects.  i lifted
my hands and groaned out this word--as it were in agony:

pretty to see, and made me think more of them than i had done before.

like a landslide when i pronounced that fearful name, and had
never come to since.  he never had heard that name before,--neither

sent a quivery little cold wave through me:

g, silent and thinking.  finally the king said:

“when ye know that i meditate a thing inconvenient, or that hath
a peril in it, why do you not warn me to cease from that project?”

it was a startling question, and a puzzler.  i didn’t quite know
how to take hold of it, or what to say, and so, of course, i ended
by saying the natural thing:

“but, sire, how can i know what your thoughts are?”

the king stopped dead in his tracks, and stared at me.

“i believed thou wert greater than merlin; and truly in magic
thou art.  but prophecy is greater than magic.  merlin is a prophet.”

i saw i had made a blunder.  i must get back my lost ground.
after a deep reflection and careful planning, i said:

“sire, i have been misunderstood.  i will explain.  there are two
kinds of prophecy.  one is the gift to foretell things that are but
a little way off, the other is the gift to foretell things that
are whole ages and centuries away.  which is the mightier gift,
do you think?”

“oh, t

he last, most surely!”

“true.  does merlin possess it?”

“partly, yes.  he foretold mysteries about my birth and future
kingship that were twenty years away.”

“has he ever gone beyond that?”

“he would not claim more, i think.”

“it is probably his limit.  all prophets have their limit.  the limit
of some of the great prophets has been a hundred years.”

“these are few, i ween.”

“there have been two still greater ones, whose limit was four
hundred and six hundred years, and one whose limit compassed

“but what are these in comparison with me?  they are nothing.”

“what?  canst thou truly look beyond even so vast a stretch
of time as--”

“seven hundred years?  my liege, as clear as the vision of an eagle
does my prophetic eye penetrate and lay bare the future of this
world for nearly thirteen centuries and a half!”

my land, you should have seen the king’s eyes spread slowly open,
and lift the earth’s entire atmosphere as much as an inch!  that
settled brer merlin.  one never had any occasion to prove his
facts, with these people; all he had to do was to state them.  it
never occurred to anybody to doubt the statement.

“now, then,” i continued, “i _could_ work both kinds of prophecy
--the long and the short--if i chose to take the trouble to keep
in practice; but i seldom exercise any but the long kind, because
the other is beneath my dignity.  it is properer to merlin’s sort

would be comparatively prompt, and would fall to the lot of a
select few--peasants of that seignory; and they wouldn’t get
anything for it, either.

but i explained it to the king myself. i said it was done with a
dynamite bomb.  this information did him no damage, because it
left him as intelligent as he was before.  however, it was a noble
miracle, in his eyes, and was another settler for merlin.  i thought
it well enough to explain that this was a miracle of so rare a sort
that it couldn’t be done except when the atmospheric conditions
were just right.  otherwise he would be encoring it every time we
had a good subject, and that would be inconvenient, because i
hadn’t any more bombs along.

drilling the king

on the morning of the fourth day, when it was just sunrise, and we
had been tramping an hour in the chill dawn, i came to a resolution:

een two mighty magicians; a duel not
of muscle but of mind, not of human skill but of superhuman art
and craft; a final struggle for supremacy between the two master
enchanters of the age.  it was realized that the most prodigious
achievements of the most renowned knights could not be worthy
of comparison with a spectacle like this; they could be but child’s
play, contrasted with this mysterious and awful battle of the gods.
yes, all the world knew it was going to be in reality a duel
between merlin and me, a measuring of his magic powers against
mine.  it was known that merlin had been busy whole days and nights
together, imbuing sir sagramor’s arms and armor with supernal
powers of offense and defense, and that he had procured for him
from the spirits of the air a fleecy veil which would render the
wearer invisible to his antagonist while still visible to other
men.  against sir sagramor, so weaponed and protected, a thousand
knights could accomplish nothing; against him no known encha

could prevail.  these facts were sure; regarding them there was
no doubt, no reason for doubt.  there was but one question: might
there be still other enchantments, _unknown_ to merlin, which could
render sir sagramor’s veil transparent to me, and make his enchanted
mail vulnerable to my weapons?  this was the one thing to be
decided in the lists.  until then the world must remain in suspense.

so the world thought there was a vast matter at stake here, and
the world was right, but it was not the one they had in their
minds.  no, a far vaster one was upon the cast of this die:
_the life of knight-errantry_.  i was a champion, it was true, but

to meet them.  we halted; the tower saluted, i responded; then
we wheeled and rode side by side to the grand-stand and faced
our king and queen, to whom we made obeisance.  the queen exclaimed:

“alack, sir boss, wilt fight naked, and without lance or sword or--”

but the king checked her and made her understand, with a polite
phrase or two, that this was none of her business.  the bugles
rang again; and we separated and rode to the ends of the lists,
and took position.  now old merlin stepped into view and cast
a dainty web of gossamer threads over sir sagramor which turned
him into hamlet’s ghost; the king made a sign, the bugles blew,
sir sagramor laid his great lance in rest, and the next moment here
he came thundering down the course with his veil flying out behind,
and i went whistling through the air like an arrow to meet him
--cocking my ear the while, as if noting the invisible knight’s
position and progress by hearing, not sight.  a chorus of encouraging
shouts

ving kerchiefs and
the thunder-crash of applause that greeted me!

said i to myself, as i coiled my lariat and hung it on my saddle-horn,
and sat there drunk with glory, “the victory is perfect--no other
will venture against me--knight-errantry is dead.”  now imagine my
astonishment--and everybody else’s, too--to hear the peculiar
bugle-call which announces that another competitor is about to
enter the lists!  there was a mystery here; i couldn’t account for
this thing.  next, i noticed merlin gliding away from me; and then
i noticed that my lasso was gone!  the old sleight-of-hand expert
had stolen it, sure, and slipped it under his robe.

the bugle blew again.  i looked, and down came sagramor riding
again, with his dust brushed off and his veil nicely re-arranged.
i trotted up to meet him, and pretended to find him by the sound
of his horse’s hoofs.  he said:

“thou’rt quick of ear, but it will not save thee from this!” and
he touched the hilt of his great sword.  “an ye
 
 ___________________________
 
ce, but a sword--and i ween ye will not be able to avoid it.”

his visor was up; there was death in his smile.  i should never
be able to dodge his sword, that was plain.  somebody was going
to die this time.  if he got the drop on me, i could name the
corpse.  we rode forward together, and saluted the royalties.
this time the king was disturbed.  he said:

“where is thy strange weapon?”

“it is stolen, sire.”

“hast another at hand?”

“no, sire, i brought only the one.”

then merlin mixed in:

“he brought but the one because there was but the one to bring.
there exists none other but that one.  it belongeth to the king
of the demons of the sea.  this man is a pretender, and ignorant,
else he had known that that weapon can be used in but eight bouts
only, and then it vanisheth away to its home under the sea.”

“then is he weaponless,” said the king.  “sir sagramore, ye will
grant him leave to borrow.”

“and i will lend!” said sir launcelot, limping up.  “h

ve mine.”

he put his hand on his sword to draw it, but sir sagramor said:

“stay, it may not be.  he shall fight with his own weapons; it
was his privilege to choose them and bring them.  if he has erred,
on his head be it.”

“knight!” said the king.  “thou’rt overwrought with passion; it
disorders thy mind.  wouldst kill a naked man?”

“an he do it, he shall answer it to me,” said sir launcelot.

“i will answer it to any he that desireth!” retorted sir sagramor hotly.

merlin broke in, rubbing his hands and smiling his lowdownest
smile of malicious gratification:

“‘tis well said, right well said!  and ‘tis enough of parleying,
let my lord the king deliver the battle signal.”

the king had to yield.  the bugle made proclamation, and we turned
apart and rode to our stations.  there we stood, a hundred yards
apart, facing each other, rigid and motionless, like horsed statues.
and so we remained, in a soundless hush, as much as a full minute,
everybody gazing,

 did feel
so happy as i did when my ninth downed its man and i detected
the wavering in the crowd which is premonitory of panic.  an instant
lost now could knock out my last chance.  but i didn’t lose it.
i raised both revolvers and pointed them--the halted host stood
their ground just about one good square moment, then broke and fled.

the day was mine.  knight-errantry was a doomed institution.  the
march of civilization was begun.  how did i feel?  ah, you never
could imagine it.

and brer merlin?  his stock was flat again.  somehow, every time
the magic of fol-de-rol tried conclusions with the magic of science,
the magic of fol-de-rol got left.

three years later

when i broke the back of knight-errantry that time, i no longer
felt obliged to work in secret.  so, the very next day i exposed
my hidden schools, my mines, and my vast system of clandestine
factories and workshops to an astonished world.  that is to say,
i exposed the nineteenth century to the inspection of th

suddenly and as mysteriously, the railway and telegraph and
telephone service ceased, the men all deserted, poles were cut
down, the church laid a ban upon the electric light!  i had to be
up and doing--and straight off.  your life was safe--nobody in
these kingdoms but merlin would venture to touch such a magician
as you without ten thousand men at his back--i had nothing to
think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your
coming.  i felt safe myself--nobody would be anxious to touch
a pet of yours.  so this is what i did.  from our various works
i selected all the men--boys i mean--whose faithfulness under
whatsoever pressure i could swear to, and i called them together
secretly and gave them their instructions.  there are fifty-two of

we had educated it out of them; they thought so, too; the interdict
woke them up like a thunderclap!  it revealed them to themselves,
and it revealed them to me, too.  with boys it was different.  such
as have been under our training from seven to ten years have had
no acquaintance with the church’s terrors, and it was among these
that i found my fifty-two.  as a next move, i paid a private visit

“yes, the one where we secretly established our first great electric
plant when i was projecting a miracle.”

“just so.  and as that miracle hadn’t become necessary then,
i thought it might be a good idea to utilize the plant now.  i’ve
provisioned the cave for a siege--”

“a good idea, a first-rate idea.”

“i think so.  i placed four of my boys there as a guard--inside,
and out of sight.  nobody was to be hurt--while outside; but any

well-educated, clean-minded young british boys.  at dawn i sent
an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop
operations and remove all life to a safe distance, as everything
was going to be blown up by secret mines, “_and no telling at what
moment--therefore, vacate at once_.”  these people knew me, and
had confidence in my word.  they would clear out without waiting
to part their hair, and i could take my own time about

ramparts of dead knights, and moved out upon the field.  the first
wounded mall who appealed for help was sitting with his back
against a dead comrade.  when the boss bent over him and spoke
to him, the man recognized him and stabbed him.  that knight was
sir meliagraunce, as i found out by tearing off his helmet.  he
will not ask for help any more.

we carried the boss to the cave and gave his wound, which was
not very serious, the best care we could.  in this service we had
the help of merlin, though we did not know it.  he was disguised
as a woman, and appeared to be a simple old peasant goodwife.
in this disguise, with brown-stained face and smooth shaven, he
had appeared a few days after the boss was hurt and offered to cook
for us, saying her people had gone off to join certain new camps
which the enemy were forming, and that she was starving.  the boss
had been getting along very well, and had amused himself with
finishing up his record.

we were glad to have this woman, for we

the woman ceased from her mysterious foolery, and started tip-toeing
toward the door.  i called out:

“stop!  what have you been doing?”

she halted, and said with an accent of malicious satisfaction:

“ye were conquerors; ye are conquered!  these others are perishing
--you also.  ye shall all die in this place--every one--except _him_.
he sleepeth now--and shall sleep thirteen centuries.  i am merlin!”

then such a delirium of silly laughter overtook him that he reeled
about like a drunken man, and presently fetched up against one
of our wires.  his mouth is spread open yet; apparently he is still
laughing.  i suppose the face will retain that petrified laugh until
the corpse turns to dust.

the boss has never stirred--sleeps like a stone.  if he does not
wake to-day we shall understand what kind of a sleep it is, and
his body will then be borne to a place in one of the remote recesses
of
