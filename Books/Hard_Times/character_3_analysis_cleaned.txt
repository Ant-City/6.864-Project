[CHARACTER] 
although he is mr. gradgrind's best friend, [CHARACTER]
is more interested in money and power than in facts. indeed, he
is himself a fiction, or a fraud. bounderby's inflated sense of
pride is illustrated by his oft-repeated declaration, "i am josiah
bounderby of coketown." this statement generally prefaces the story
of bounderby's childhood poverty and suffering, a story designed
to impress its listeners with a sense of the young [CHARACTER]'s
determination and self-discipline. however, dickens explodes the
myth of the self-made man when bounderby's mother, mrs. pegler,
reveals that her son had a decent, loving childhood and a good education,
and that he was not abandoned, after all.

	bounderby's attitude represents the social changes created
by industrialization and capitalism. whereas birth or bloodline
formerly determined the social hierarchy, in an industrialized,
capitalist society, wealth determines who holds the most power.
thus, bounderby takes great delight in the fact that mrs. sparsit,
an aristocrat who has fallen on hard times, has become his servant,
while his own ambition has enabled him to rise from humble beginnings to
become the wealthy owner of a factory and a bank. however, in depicting
bounderby, the capitalist, as a coarse, vain, self-interested hypocrite,
dickens implies that bounderby uses his wealth and power irresponsibly,
contributing to the muddled relations between rich and poor, especially
in his treatment of stephen after the hands cast stephen out to
form a union.
