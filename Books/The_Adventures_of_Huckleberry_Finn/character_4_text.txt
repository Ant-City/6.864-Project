yards, and then the cave
opened up. tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked
under a wall where you wouldnâ€™t a noticed that there was a hole.  we
went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and
sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  tom says:

â€œnow, weâ€™ll start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyerâ€™s gang.
everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name
in blood.â€

everybody was willing.  so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had
wrote the oath on, and read it.  it swore every boy to stick to the
band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to
any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and
his family must do it, and he mustnâ€™t eat and he mustnâ€™t sleep till he
had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign
of the band. and nobody that didnâ€™t belong to the band could use that
mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it

said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it
wouldnâ€™t be fair and square for the others.  well, nobody could think of
anything to do--everybody was stumped, and set still.  i was most ready
to cry; but all at once i thought of a way, and so i offered them miss
watson--they could kill her.  everybody said:

â€œoh, sheâ€™ll do.  thatâ€™s all right.  huck can come in.â€

then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,
and i made my mark on the paper.

â€œnow,â€ says ben rogers, â€œwhatâ€™s the line of business of this gang?â€

â€œnothing only robbery and murder,â€ tom said.

â€œbut who are we going to rob?--houses, or cattle, or--â€

â€œstuff! stealing cattle and such things ainâ€™t robbery; itâ€™s burglary,â€
 says tom sawyer.  â€œwe ainâ€™t burglars.  that ainâ€™t no sort of style.  we
are highwaymen.  we stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks
on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.â€

tson would take hold
and knock it all down again.  i judged i could see that there was two
providences, and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the
widowâ€™s providence, but if miss watsonâ€™s got him there warnâ€™t no help
for him any more.  i thought it all out, and reckoned i would belong
to the widowâ€™s if he wanted me, though i couldnâ€™t make out how he was
a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing i was
so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.

pap he hadnâ€™t been seen for more than a year, and that was comfortable
for me; i didnâ€™t want to see him no more.  he used to always whale me
when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though i used to take
to the woods most of the time when he was around.  well, about this time
he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile above town, so
people said.  they judged it was him, anyway; said this drownded man was
just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long hair, which was all

like pap; but they couldnâ€™t make nothing out of the face, because it had
been in the water so long it warnâ€™t much like a face at all.  they said
he was floating on his back in the water.  they took him and buried him
on the bank.  but i warnâ€™t comfortable long, because i happened to think
of something.  i knowed mighty well that a drownded man donâ€™t float on
his back, but on his face.  so i knowed, then, that this warnâ€™t pap, but
a woman dressed up in a manâ€™s clothes.  so i was uncomfortable again.
 i judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though i wished he
wouldnâ€™t.

we played robber now and then about a month, and then i resigned.  all
the boys did.  we hadnâ€™t robbed nobody, hadnâ€™t killed any people, but
only just pretended.  we used to hop out of the woods and go charging
down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market,
but we never hived any of them.  tom sawyer called t

t.  he says:

â€œwhy, what can you mean, my boy?â€

i says, â€œdonâ€™t you ask me no questions about it, please.  youâ€™ll take
it--wonâ€™t you?â€

he says:

â€œwell, iâ€™m puzzled.  is something the matter?â€

â€œplease take it,â€ says i, â€œand donâ€™t ask me nothing--then i wonâ€™t have to
tell no lies.â€

he studied a while, and then he says:

â€œoho-o!  i think i see.  you want to _sell_ all your property to me--not
give it.  thatâ€™s the correct idea.â€

then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:

â€œthere; you see it says â€˜for a consideration.â€™  that means i have bought
it of you and paid you for it.  hereâ€™s a dollar for you.  now you sign
it.â€

so i signed it, and left.

miss watsonâ€™s nigger, jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which
had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do
magic with it.  he said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed
everything.  so i went to him that night and told him pap was here

i had shut the door to.  then i turned around and there he was.  i used
to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.  i reckoned i
was scared now, too; but in a minute i see i was mistaken--that is, after
the first jolt, as you may say, when my breath sort of hitched, he being
so unexpected; but right away after i see i warnâ€™t scared of him worth

of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that
had just come, and he didnâ€™t know the old man; so he said courts mustnâ€™t
interfere and separate families if they could help it; said heâ€™d druther
not take a child away from its father.  so judge thatcher and the widow
had to quit on the business.

that pleased the old man till he couldnâ€™t rest.  he said heâ€™d cowhide
me till i was black and blue if i didnâ€™t raise some money for him.  i
borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher, and pap took it and got
drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;
then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed
him again for a week.  but he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss
of his son, and heâ€™d make it warm for _him_.

when he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.
so he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and

d him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just
old pie to him, so to speak.  and after supper he talked to him about
temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said heâ€™d been
a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over
a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldnâ€™t be ashamed of, and he hoped the
judge would help him and not look down on him.  the judge said he could
hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again; pap
said heâ€™d been a man that had always been misunderstood before, and the
judge said he believed it.  the old man said that what a man wanted
that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they cried
again.  and when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his
hand, and says:

â€œlook at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.
thereâ€™s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ainâ€™t so no more; itâ€™s

the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didnâ€™t know no other way.




chapter vi.

well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
went for me, too, for not stopping school.  he catched me a couple of
times and thrashed me, but i went to school just the same, and dodged
him or outrun him most of the time.  i didnâ€™t want to go to school much
before, but i reckoned iâ€™d go now to spite pap.  that law trial was a
slow business--appeared like they warnâ€™t ever going to get started on it;
so every now and then iâ€™d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge
for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding.  every time he got money he
got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised cain around town; and
every time he raised cain he got jailed.  he was just suited--this kind
of thing was right in his line.

he got to hanging around the widowâ€™s too much and so she told him at
last that

.
we lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the
key under his head nights.  he had a gun which he had stole, i reckon,
and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on.  every little
while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to the
ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and got
drunk and had a good time, and licked me.  the widow she found out where
i was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me; but
pap drove him off with the gun, and it warnâ€™t long after that till i was
used to being where i was, and liked it--all but the cowhide part.

it was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking
and fishing, and no books nor study.  two months or more run along, and
my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and i didnâ€™t see how iâ€™d ever
got to like it so well at the widowâ€™s, where you had to wash, and eat on
a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be forev

bothering over a book, and have old miss watson pecking at you all the
time.  i didnâ€™t want to go back no more.  i had stopped cussing, because
the widow didnâ€™t like it; but now i took to it again because pap hadnâ€™t
no objections.  it was pretty good times up in the woods there, take it
all around.

but by and by pap got too handy with his hickâ€™ry, and i couldnâ€™t stand
it. i was all over welts.  he got to going away so much, too, and
locking me in.  once he locked me in and was gone three days.  it was
dreadful lonesome.  i judged he had got drownded, and i wasnâ€™t ever
going to get out any more.  i was scared.  i made up my mind i would fix
up some way to leave there.  i had tried to get out of that cabin many
a time, but i couldnâ€™t find no way.  there warnâ€™t a window to it big
enough for a dog to

 get through.  i couldnâ€™t get up the chimbly; it
was too narrow.  the door was thick, solid oak slabs.  pap was pretty
careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away;
i reckon i had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, i
was most all the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in
the time.  but this time i found something at last; i found an old rusty
wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the
clapboards of the roof. i greased it up and went to work.  there was an
old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end

 of the cabin
behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and
putting the candle out.  i got under the table and raised the blanket,
and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out--big enough
to let me through.  well, it was a good long job, but i was getting
towards the end of it when i heard papâ€™s gun in the woods.  i got rid of
the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty
soon pap come in.

pap warnâ€™t in a good humor--so he was his natural self.  he said he was
down town, and everything was going wrong.  his lawyer said he reckoned
he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on
the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long time, and judge
thatcher knowed how to do it. and he said people allowed thereâ€™d be
another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
guardian, and they guessed it would win this time.  this shook me up
consi

nd if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place
six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they
dropped and they couldnâ€™t find me.  that made me pretty uneasy again,
but only for a minute; i reckoned i wouldnâ€™t stay on hand till he got
that chance.

the old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had
got. there was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon,
ammunition, and a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two
newspapers for wadding, besides some tow.  i toted up a load, and went
back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest.  i thought it all
over, and i reckoned i would walk off with the gun and some lines, and
take to the woods when i run away.  i guessed i wouldnâ€™t stay in one
place, but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and
hunt and fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor
the widow couldnâ€™t ever find me any more.  i judged i would saw out and
leave

that night if pap got drunk enough, and i reckoned he would.  i
got so full of it i didnâ€™t notice how long i was staying till the old
man hollered and asked me whether i was asleep or drownded.

i got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark.  while
i was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of
warmed up, and went to ripping again.  he had been drunk over in town,
and laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at.  a body
would a thought he was adam--he was

he couldnâ€™t be sold till heâ€™d been in
the state six months, and he hadnâ€™t been there that long yet.  there,
now--thatâ€™s a specimen.  they call that a govment that canâ€™t sell a free
nigger till heâ€™s been in the state six months.  hereâ€™s a govment that
calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and thinks it is a
govment, and yetâ€™s got to set stock-still for six whole months before
it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free
nigger, and--â€

pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was
taking him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and
barked both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind
of language--mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give
the tub some, too, all along, here and there.  he hopped around the
cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding
first one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his
left foot all

ood judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his
toes leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that
fairly made a bodyâ€™s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and
rolled there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over
anything he had ever done previous.  he said so his own self afterwards.
 he had heard old sowberry hagan in his best days, and he said it laid
over him, too; but i reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.

after supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there
for two drunks and one delirium tremens.  that was always his word.  i
judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then i would steal
the key, or saw myself out, one or tâ€™other.  he drank and drank, and
tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didnâ€™t run my way.
 he didnâ€™t go sound asleep, but was uneasy.  he groaned and moaned and
thrashed around this way and that for a long time.  at last i got so
sleepy i couldnâ€™t kee

p my eyes open all i could do, and so before i
knowed what i was about i was sound asleep, and the candle burning.

i donâ€™t know how long i was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an
awful scream and i was up.  there was pap looking wild, and skipping
around every which way and yelling about snakes.  he said they was
crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say
one had bit him on the cheek--but i couldnâ€™t see no snakes.  he started
and run round and round the cabin, hollering â€œtake him off! take him
off! heâ€™s biting me on the neck!â€  i never see a man look so wild in the
eyes. pretty soon he was all fagged out, and fell down panting; then he
rolled over and over wonderful fast, ki

ty soon he was all tired out, and
dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would rest a
minute and then kill me. he put his knife under him, and said he would
sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.

so he dozed off pretty soon.  by and by i got the old split-bottom chair
and clumb up as easy as i could, not to make any noise, and got down the
gun.  i slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded, then i
laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set down
behind it to wait for him to stir.  and how slow and still the time did
drag along.




chapter vii.

â€œgit up!  what you â€˜bout?â€

i opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where i was.  it
was after sun-up, and i had been sound asleep.  pap was standing over me
looking sour and sick, too.  he says:

â€œwhat you doinâ€™ with this gun?â€

i judged he didnâ€™t know nothing about what he had been doing, so i says:

â€œsomebody tried to get in, so i was laying for h

some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of
bark; so i knowed the river had begun to rise.  i reckoned i would have
great times now if i was over at the town.  the june rise used to be
always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes
cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts--sometimes a dozen logs
together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
wood-yards and the sawmill.

i went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and tâ€™other one out
for what the rise might fetch along.  well, all at once here comes a
canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding
high like a duck.  i shot head-first off of the bank like a frog,
clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe.  i just expected
thereâ€™d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that
to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it theyâ€™d
raise up and laugh at him.  but it warnâ€™t so this time.
 
 ___________________________
 
  it was a
drift-canoe sure enough, and i clumb in and paddled her ashore.  thinks
i, the old man will be glad when he sees this--sheâ€™s worth ten dollars.
 but when i got to shore pap wasnâ€™t in sight yet, and as i was running
her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and
willows, i struck another idea:  i judged iâ€™d hide her good, and then,
â€˜stead of taking to the woods when i run off, iâ€™d go down the river
about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a
rough time tramping on foot.

it was pretty close to the shanty, and i thought i heard the old man
coming all the time; but i got her hid; and then i out and looked around

bead on a bird with his gun.  so he hadnâ€™t seen anything.

when he got along i was hard at it taking up a â€œtrotâ€ line.  he abused
me a little for being so slow; but i told him i fell in the river, and
that was what made me so long.  i knowed he would see i was wet, and
then he would be asking questions.  we got five catfish off the lines
and went home.

while we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about
wore out, i got to thinking that if i could fix up some way to keep pap
and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing
than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you
see, all kinds of things might happen.  well, i didnâ€™t see no way for a
while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of
water, and he says:

â€œanother time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you
hear? that man warnâ€™t here for no good.  iâ€™d a shot him.  next time you
roust me out, you hear?â€

then he dropped 
 
 ___________________________
 
down and went to sleep again; but what he had been
saying give me the very idea i wanted.  i says to myself, i can fix it
now so nobody wonâ€™t think of following me.

about twelve oâ€™clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  the
river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the
rise. by and by along comes part of a log raft--nine logs fast together.
 we went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  then we had dinner.
anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch
more stuff; but that warnâ€™t papâ€™s style.  nine logs was enough for one
time; he must shove right over to town and sell.  so he locked me in and
took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.
 i judged he wouldnâ€™t come back that night.  i waited till i reckoned he
had got a good start; then i out with my saw, and went to work on that
log again.  before he was tâ€™other side of the river i was out of the
hole; h

it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  then i
took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldnâ€™t
drip) till i got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into
the river.  now i thought of something else.  so i went and got the bag
of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.
 i took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the
bottom of it with the saw, for there warnâ€™t no knives and forks on the
place--pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  then
i carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through
the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide
and full of rushes--and ducks too, you might say, in the season.  there
was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went
miles away, i donâ€™t know where, but it didnâ€™t go to the river.  the meal
sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  i dropped

gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start
when i heard a sound away over the water.  i listened.  pretty soon i
made it out.  it was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
oars working in rowlocks when itâ€™s a still night.  i peeped out through
the willow branches, and there it was--a skiff, away across the water.
 i couldnâ€™t tell how many was in it.  it kept a-coming, and when it was
abreast of me i see there warnâ€™t but one man in it.  thinkâ€™s i, maybe
itâ€™s pap, though i warnâ€™t expecting him.  he dropped below me with the
current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,
and he went by so close i could a reached out the gun and touched him.
 well, it _was_ pap, sure enough--and sober, too, by the way he laid his
oars.

i didnâ€™t lose no time.  the next minute i was a-spinning down stream
soft but quick in the shade of the bank.  i made two mile and a half,
and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of

to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in
close, where the bread did.  when sheâ€™d got pretty well along down
towards me, i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread,
and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  where
the log forked i could peep through.

by and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could

 pap, and judge thatcher, and bessie thatcher, and jo harper, and tom

 everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and
says:

â€œlook sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe heâ€™s
washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the waterâ€™s edge.  i
hope so, anyway.â€

i didnâ€™t hope so.  they all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly
in my face, and kept still, watching with all

foot of jimâ€™s blanket, ever so natural, thinking thereâ€™d be some fun
when jim found him there.  well, by night i forgot all about the snake,
and when jim flung himself down on the blanket while i struck a light
the snakeâ€™s mate was there, and bit him.

he jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the
varmint curled up and ready for another spring.  i laid him out in a
second with a stick, and jim grabbed papâ€™s whisky-jug and begun to pour
it down.

he was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel.  that all
comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave
a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it.  jim told
me to chop off the snakeâ€™s head and throw it away, and then skin the
body and roast a piece of it.  i done it, and he eat it and said it
would help cure him. he made me take off the rattles and tie them around
his wrist, too.  he said that

and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for i warnâ€™t going
to let jim find out it was all my fault, not if i could help it.

jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his
head and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he
went to sucking at the jug again.  his foot swelled up pretty big, and
so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so i judged
he was all right; but iâ€™d druther been bit with a snake than papâ€™s
whisky.

jim was laid up for four days and nights.  then the swelling was all
gone and he was around again.  i made up my mind i wouldnâ€™t ever take
a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that i see what had come
of it. jim said he reckoned i would believe him next time.  and he said
that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadnâ€™t
got to the end of it yet.  he said he druther see the new moon over his
left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up

tting to feel that way myself, though iâ€™ve
always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is
one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  old hank
bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less than two years he
got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread himself out so
that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him
edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so
they say, but i didnâ€™t see it.  pap told me.  but anyway it all come of
looking at the moon that way, like a fool.

well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks
again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big
hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was
as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two
hundred pounds. we couldnâ€™t handle him, of course; he would a flung us
into illinois.  we just set there and watched him rip and tear around

then she got to talking about her husband, and about her relations up
the river, and her relations down the river, and about how much better
off they used to was, and how they didnâ€™t know but theyâ€™d made a mistake
coming to our town, instead of letting well alone--and so on and so on,
till i was afeard i had made a mistake coming to her to find out what
was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the
murder, and then i was pretty willing to let her clatter right along.
 she told about me and tom sawyer finding the six thousand dollars (only
she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he was, and what
a hard lot i was, and at last she got down to where i was murdered.  i

every night now i used to slip ashore towards ten oâ€™clock at some little
village, and buy ten or fifteen centsâ€™ worth of meal or bacon or other
stuff to eat; and sometimes i lifted a chicken that warnâ€™t roosting
comfortable, and took him along.  pap always said, take a chicken when
you get a chance, because if you donâ€™t want him yourself you can easy
find somebody that does, and a good deed ainâ€™t ever forgot.  i never see
pap when he didnâ€™t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to
say, anyway.

mornings before daylight i slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of
that kind.  pap always said it warnâ€™t no harm to borrow things if you

from the list and say we wouldnâ€™t borrow them any more--then he reckoned
it wouldnâ€™t be no harm to borrow the others.  so we talked it over all
one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds

he stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only

about a dozen houses there, and if they didnâ€™t happen to have them lit
up, how was we going to know we was passing a town?  jim said if the two
big rivers joined together there, that would show.  but i said maybe
we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the
same old river again. that disturbed jim--and me too.  so the question
was, what to do?  i said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed,
and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and
was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to
cairo.  jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and
waited.

there warnâ€™t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and
not pass it without seeing it.  he said heâ€™d be mighty sure to see it,

tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but i warnâ€™t man

â€œheâ€™s white.â€

 enough it was some more work of the
rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it?  it would only
look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more
bad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep
still.

by and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warnâ€™t no
way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy
a canoe to go back in.  we warnâ€™t going to borrow it when there warnâ€™t
anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after
us.

so we shoved out after dark on the raft.

anybody that donâ€™t believe yet that itâ€™s foolishness to handle a
snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it
now if they read on and see what more it done for us.

the place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  but we
didnâ€™t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and
more.  well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next

all smoked and talked, and i eat and talked.  the young women had
quilts around them, and their hair down their backs.  they all asked me
questions, and i told them how pap and me and all the family was living
on a little farm down at the bottom of arkansaw, and my sister mary ann
run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and bill went
to hunt them and he warnâ€™t heard of no more, and tom and mort died,
and then there warnâ€™t nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just
trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died
i took what there was left, because the farm didnâ€™t belong to us, and

col.  grangerford was a gentleman, you see.  he was a gentleman all
over; and so was his family.  he was well born, as the saying is, and
thatâ€™s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the widow douglas
said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy
in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warnâ€™t no more
quality than a mudcat himself.  col.  grangerford was very tall and
very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it
anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and
he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and
a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so
deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at
you, as you may say.  his

i said i would. so i slid out and slipped off up the
road, and there warnâ€™t anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,
for there warnâ€™t any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor
in summer-time because itâ€™s cool.  if you notice, most folks donâ€™t go to
church only when theyâ€™ve got to; but a hog is different.

says i to myself, somethingâ€™s up; it ainâ€™t natural for a girl to be in
such a sweat about a testament.  so i give it a shake, and out drops a
little piece of paper with â€œhalf-past twoâ€ wrote on it with a pencil.  i
ransacked it, but couldnâ€™t find anything else.  i couldnâ€™t make anything
out of that, so i put the paper in the book again, and when i got home
and upstairs there was miss sophia in her door waiting for me.  she
pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the testament till
she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and
before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and
said i was the best

 boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  she was
mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it
made her powerful pretty.  i was a good deal astonished, but when i got
my breath i asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if i
had read it, and i said no, and she asked me if i could read writing,
and i told her â€œno, only coarse-hand,â€ and then she said the paper
warnâ€™t anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and i might go and
play now.

i went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon
i noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  when we was out
of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes
a-running, and says:

â€œmars jawge, if youâ€™ll come down into de swamp iâ€™ll show you a whole
stack oâ€™ water-moccasins.â€

thinks i, thatâ€™s mighty curious; he said that yesterday.  he oughter

to see such things.  i ainâ€™t ever going to get shut of
them--lots of times i dream about them.

i stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.
sometimes i heard guns away off in the woods; and twice i seen little
gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so i reckoned the
trouble was still a-going on.  i was mighty downhearted; so i made up my
mind i wouldnâ€™t ever go anear that house again, because i reckoned i
was to blame, somehow. i judged that that piece of paper meant that miss
sophia was to meet harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and
i judged i ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way
she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess
wouldnâ€™t ever happened.

when i got down out of the tree i crept along down the river bank a
piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and
tugged at them till i got them ashore; then i covered up their faces,
and got away as quick as i coul

never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; itâ€™s the best way;
then you donâ€™t have no quarrels, and donâ€™t get into no trouble.  if they
wanted us to call them kings and dukes, i hadnâ€™t no objections, â€˜long as
it would keep peace in the family; and it warnâ€™t no use to tell jim, so
i didnâ€™t tell him.  if i never learnt nothing else out of pap, i learnt
that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them
have their own way.




chapter xx.

they asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we
covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of
running--was jim a runaway nigger?  says i:

â€œgoodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?â€

no, they allowed he wouldnâ€™t.  i had to account for things some way, so
i says:

â€œmy folks was living in pike county, in missouri, where

â€œyou shall, then, before youâ€™re three days older, fallen grandeur,â€ says
the duke.  â€œthe first good town we come to weâ€™ll hire a hall and do the
sword fight in richard iii. and the balcony scene in romeo and juliet.
how does that strike you?â€

â€œiâ€™m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, bilgewater; but, you
see, i donâ€™t know nothing about play-actinâ€™, and hainâ€™t ever seen much
of it.  i was too small when pap used to have â€˜em at the palace.  do you
reckon you can learn me?â€

â€œeasy!â€

â€œall right.  iâ€™m jist a-freeznâ€™ for something fresh, anyway.  leâ€™s

so the duke he told him all about who romeo was and who juliet was, and
said he was used to being romeo, so the king could be juliet.

â€œbut if julietâ€™s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white
whiskers is goinâ€™ to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.â€

the duke was thinking _heâ€™d_ been doing pretty well till the king come
to show up, but after that he didnâ€™t think so so much.  he had set
up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that
printing-office--horse bills--and took the money, four dollars.  and he
had got in ten dollarsâ€™ worth of advertisements for the paper, which he
said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance--so
they done it. the price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took
in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them
paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as
usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the
price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash.
 he set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself,

his own head--three verses--kind of sweet and saddish--the name of it was,
â€œyes, crush, cold world, this breaking heartâ€--and he left that all set
up and ready to print in the paper, and didnâ€™t charge nothing for it.
 well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said heâ€™d done a pretty
square dayâ€™s work for it.

then he showed us another little job heâ€™d printed and hadnâ€™t charged
for, because it was for us.  it had a picture of a runaway nigger with
a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and â€œ$200 rewardâ€ under it.  the
reading was all about jim, and just described him to a dot.  it said
he run away from st. jacquesâ€™ plantation, forty mile below new orle

time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left, anyway, before
the show was over, but one boy which was asleep.  so the duke said these
arkansaw lunkheads couldnâ€™t come up to shakespeare; what they wanted
was low comedy--and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he
reckoned.  he said he could size their style.  so next morning he got
some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off
some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village.  the bills said:

his funeral orgies shâ€™d be public.â€

and so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and
every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke
he couldnâ€™t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,
â€œ_obsequies_, you old fool,â€ and folds it up, and goes to goo-gooing and
reaching it over peopleâ€™s heads to him.  the king he reads it and puts
it in his pocket, and says:

i didnâ€™t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and i
couldnâ€™t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.  so
for a minute i didnâ€™t say nothing; then i says:

â€œiâ€™d ruther not _tell_ you where i put it, miss mary jane, if you donâ€™t
mind letting me off; but iâ€™ll write it for you on a piece of paper, and
you can read it along the road to mr. lothropâ€™s, if you want to.  do you
reckon that â€˜ll do?â€

â€œoh, yes.â€

so i wrote:  â€œi put it in the coffin.  it was in there when you was
crying there, away in the night.  i was behind the door, and i was
mighty sorry for you, miss mary jane.â€

it made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by
herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own
roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when i folded it up

reached out his hand, and says:

â€œwhy, is this my poor dead brotherâ€™s old friend that heâ€™s wrote so often
about?â€

the lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked
pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side
and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:

â€œthat â€˜ll fix it.  iâ€™ll take the order and send it, along with your
brotherâ€™s, and then theyâ€™ll know itâ€™s all right.â€

so they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted
his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;
and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the
duke looked sick.  but he took the pen and wrote.  so then the lawyer
turns to the new old gentleman and says:

â€œyou and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.â€

the old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldnâ€™t read it.  the lawyer looked
powerful astonished, and says:

â€œwell,

e track of a solution, but itâ€™s gone to grass,
partly.  but anyway, one thing is proved--_these_ two ainâ€™t either of â€˜em
wilksesâ€--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.

well, what do you think?  that muleheaded old fool wouldnâ€™t give in
_then_! indeed he wouldnâ€™t.  said it warnâ€™t no fair test.  said his
brother william was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadnâ€™t tried
to write--_he_ see william was going to play one of his jokes the minute
he put the pen to paper.  and so he warmed up and went warbling and
warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was
saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:

â€œiâ€™ve thought of something.  is there anybody here that helped to lay
out my br--helped to lay out the late peter wilks for burying?â€

â€œyes,â€ says somebody, â€œme and ab turner done it.  weâ€™re both here.â€

then the old man turns towards the king, and says:

his eye lights up like he judged heâ€™d got the king _this_ time, and
says:

â€œthere--youâ€™ve heard what he said!  was there any such mark on peter
wilksâ€™ breast?â€

both of them spoke up and says:

â€œwe didnâ€™t see no such mark.â€

â€œgood!â€ says the old gentleman.  â€œnow, what you _did_ see on his breast
was a small dim p, and a b (which is an initial he dropped when he was
young), and a w, with dashes between them, so:  p--b--wâ€--and he marked
them that way on a piece of paper.  â€œcome, ainâ€™t that what you saw?â€

both of them spoke up again, and says:

â€œno, we _didnâ€™t_.  we never seen any marks at all.â€

well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:

â€œthe whole _bilin_â€™ of â€˜m â€˜s frauds!  leâ€™s duck â€˜em! leâ€™s drown â€˜em!
leâ€™s ride â€˜em on a rail!â€ and everybody was whooping at once, and there
was a rattling powwow.  but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells,
and says:

t thing and the clean thing, and go and write
to that niggerâ€™s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me i
knowed it was a lie, and he knowed it.  you canâ€™t pray a lie--i found
that out.

so i was full of trouble, full as i could be; and didnâ€™t know what to
do. at last i had an idea; and i says, iâ€™ll go and write the letter--and
then see if i can pray.  why, it was astonishing, the way i felt as
light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  so i
got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down
and wrote:

miss watson, your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below
pikesville, and mr. phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
reward if you send.

_huck finn._

i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever
felt so in my life, and i knowed i could pray now.  but i didnâ€™t do it
straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking
how good it was all this happened so, and how near

was when
i come back out of the fog; and when i come to him again in the swamp,
up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call
me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how
good he always was; and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling
the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said i was
the best friend old jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one heâ€™s
got now; and then i happened to look around and see that paper.

it was a close place.  i took it up, and held it in my hand.  i was
a-trembling, because iâ€™d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and
i knowed it.  i studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then
says to myself:

â€œall right, then, iâ€™ll _go_ to hellâ€--and tore it up.

it was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  and i let
them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  i shoved the
whole thing out of my head, and said i would take up wickednes

so there it was!--but i couldnâ€™t help it.  tom and me was to sleep in the
same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to
bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the
lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for i didnâ€™t believe anybody was
going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if i didnâ€™t hurry up
and give them one theyâ€™d get into trouble sure.

on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered,
and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didnâ€™t come back no more, and
what a stir there was when jim run away; and i told tom all about our
royal nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as i had
time to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of
it--it was as much as half-after eight, then--here comes a raging rush of
people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin
pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;

â€œbut itâ€™s _somebodyâ€™s_ plates, ainâ€™t it?â€

â€œwell, sposâ€™n it is?  what does the _prisoner_ care whose--â€

he broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.  so we
cleared out for the house.

along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
clothes-line; and i found an old sack and put them in it, and we went
down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.  i called it borrowing,
because that was what pap always called it; but tom said it warnâ€™t
borrowing, it was stealing.  he said we was representing prisoners; and
prisoners donâ€™t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody
donâ€™t blame them for it, either.  it ainâ€™t no crime in a prisoner to
steal the thing he needs to get away with, tom said; itâ€™s his right; and
so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to
steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves
out of prison with.

â€œoh, i donâ€™t know.  but heâ€™s got to have it.  all the nobility does.â€

that was just his way.  if it didnâ€™t suit him to explain a thing to you,
he wouldnâ€™t do it.  you might pump at him a week, it wouldnâ€™t make no
difference.

heâ€™d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to
finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a
mournful inscription--said jim got to have one, like they all done.  he
made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:

1.  here a captive heart busted. 2.  here a poor prisoner, forsook by
the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3.  here a lonely
heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven
years of solitary captivity. 4.  here, homeless and friendless, after
thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger,
natural son of louis xiv.

tomâ€™s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.

â€œbut, jim, you _got_ to have â€˜em--they all do.  so donâ€™t make no more
fuss about it.  prisoners ainâ€™t ever without rats.  there ainâ€™t no
instance of it.  and they train them, and pet them, and learn them
tricks, and they get to be as sociable as flies.  but you got to play

â€œi ainâ€™ got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece oâ€™ paper, en a juice-harp;

â€œyes they would _they_ donâ€™t care what kind of music â€˜tis.  a
jews-harpâ€™s plenty good enough for a rat.  all animals like music--in a
prison they dote on it.  specially, painful music; and you canâ€™t get no
other kind out of a jews-harp.  it always interests them; they come out
to see whatâ€™s the matter with you.  yes, youâ€™re all right; youâ€™re fixed

e reckoned we was all
going to die, but didnâ€™t.  it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever
see; and tom said the same.

but as i was saying, weâ€™d got all the work done now, at last; and we was
all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly jim.  the old man had wrote
a couple of times to the plantation below orleans to come and get their
runaway nigger, but hadnâ€™t got no answer, because there warnâ€™t no such
plantation; so he allowed he would advertise jim in the st. louis and
new orleans papers; and when he mentioned the st. louis ones it give me
the cold shivers, and i see we hadnâ€™t no time to lose. so tom said, now
for the nonnamous letters.

â€œwhatâ€™s them?â€  i says.

â€œwarnings to the people that something is up.  sometimes itâ€™s done one
way, sometimes another.  but thereâ€™s always somebody spying around that
gives notice to the governor of the castle.  when louis xvi. was going
to light out of the tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  itâ€™s a very good
way, and so is

and then tom he talked along and talked along, and says, leâ€™s all three
slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for
howling adventures amongst the injuns, over in the territory, for a
couple of weeks or two; and i says, all right, that suits me, but i
ainâ€™t got no money for to buy the outfit, and i reckon i couldnâ€™t get
none from home, because itâ€™s likely papâ€™s been back before now, and got
it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up.

â€œno, he hainâ€™t,â€ tom says; â€œitâ€™s all there yet--six thousand dollars
and more; and your pap hainâ€™t ever been back since.  hadnâ€™t when i come
away, anyhow.â€

jim says, kind of solemn:

â€œhe ainâ€™t a-cominâ€™ back no moâ€™, huck.â€

i says:

â€œwhy, jim?â€

â€œnemmine why, huck--but he ainâ€™t cominâ€™ back no mo.â€

but i kept at him; so at last he says:
