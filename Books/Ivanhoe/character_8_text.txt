call that churl of a saxon saint at burton-on-trent. next day’s march
brings them within our reach, and, falcon-ways, we swoop on them
at once. presently after i will appear in mine own shape, play the
courteous knight, rescue the unfortunate and afflicted fair one from the
hands of the rude ravishers, conduct her to front-de-boeuf’s castle, or
to normandy, if it should be necessary, and produce her not again to her
kindred until she be the bride and dame of maurice de bracy.”

“a marvellously sage plan,” said fitzurse, “and, as i think, not
entirely of thine own device.--come, be frank, de bracy, who aided
thee in the invention? and who is to assist in the execution? for, as i
think, thine own band lies as far off as york.”

“marry, if thou must needs know,” said de bracy, “it was the templar
brian de bois-guilbert that shaped out the enterprise, which the
adventure of the men of benjamin suggested to me. he is to aid me in
the onslaught, and he an

wonder not that the restraint appears to gall you--more it were for your
honour to have retained the dress and language of an outlaw, than
to veil the deeds of one under an affectation of gentle language and
demeanour.”

“you counsel well, lady,” said the norman; “and in the bold language
which best justifies bold action i tell thee, thou shalt never leave
this castle, or thou shalt leave it as maurice de bracy’s wife. i am
not wont to be baffled in my enterprises, nor needs a norman noble
scrupulously to vindicate his conduct to the saxon maiden whom he
distinguishes by the offer of his hand. thou art proud, rowena, and thou
art the fitter to be my wife. by what other means couldst thou be raised
to high honour and to princely place, saving by my alliance? how else
wouldst thou escape from the mean precincts of a country grange, where
saxons herd with the swine which form their wealth, to take thy

stane, “an honourable imprisonment, with due care
of my board and of my couch, as becomes my rank, and as is due to one
who is in treaty for ransom. moreover, i hold him that deems himself the
best of you, bound to answer to me with his body for this aggression on
my freedom. this defiance hath already been sent to thee by thy sewer;
thou underliest it, and art bound to answer me--there lies my glove.”

“i answer not the challenge of my prisoner,” said front-de-boeuf;
“nor shalt thou, maurice de bracy.--giles,” he continued, “hang the
franklin’s glove upon the tine of yonder branched antlers: there shall
it remain until he is a free man. should he then presume to demand it,
or to affirm he was unlawfully made my prisoner, by the belt of saint
christopher, he will speak to one who hath never refused to meet a foe
on foot or on horseback, alone or with his vassals at his back!”

the saxon prisoners were accordingly removed, just as they introduced

delivering up our prisoners?”

“how?” exclaimed the templar; “deliver up our prisoners, and stand an
object alike of ridicule and execration, as the doughty warriors who
dared by a night-attack to possess themselves of the persons of a party
of defenceless travellers, yet could not make good a strong castle
against a vagabond troop of outlaws, led by swineherds, jesters, and the
very refuse of mankind?--shame on thy counsel, maurice de bracy!--the
ruins of this castle shall bury both my body and my shame, ere i consent
to such base and dishonourable composition.”

“let us to the walls, then,” said de bracy, carelessly; “that man never
breathed, be he turk or templar, who held life at lighter rate than i
do. but i trust there is no dishonour in wishing i had here some two
scores of my gallant troop of free companions?--oh, my brave lances! if
ye knew but how hard your captain were this day bested, how soon should

“wish for whom thou wilt,” said the templar, “but let us make
what defence we can with the soldiers who remain--they are chiefly
front-de-boeuf’s followers, hated by the english for a thousand acts of
insolence and oppression.”

“the better,” said de bracy; “the rugged slaves will defend themselves
to the last drop of their blood, ere they encounter the revenge of the
peasants without. let us up and be doing, then, brian de bois-guilbert;
and, live or die, thou shalt see maurice de bracy bear himself this day
as a gentleman of blood and lineage.”

“to the walls!” answered the templar; and they both ascended the
battlements to do all that skill could dictate, and manhood accomplish,
in defence of the place. they readily agreed that the point of greatest
danger was that opposite to the outwork of which the assailants had
possessed themselves. the castle, indeed, was divided from that barbican
by the moat, and it was impossible that the besiegers could assail the

e. at length the norman received a blow, which,
though its force was partly parried by his shield, for otherwise never
more would de bracy have again moved limb, descended yet with such
violence on his crest, that he measured his length on the paved floor.

“yield thee, de bracy,” said the black champion, stooping over him, and
holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the
knights dispatched their enemies, (and which was called the dagger of
mercy,)--“yield thee, maurice de bracy, rescue or no rescue, or thou art
but a dead man.”

“i will not yield,” replied de bracy faintly, “to an unknown conqueror.
tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me--it shall never be said
that maurice de bracy was prisoner to a nameless churl.”

the black knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished.

“i yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue,” answered the
norman, exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacy for one of

e death-hymn had died on the wind, the outlaws were again busied in
the distribution of their spoil.

“valiant knight,” said locksley to the black champion, “without whose
good heart and mighty arm our enterprise must altogether have failed,
will it please you to take from that mass of spoil whatever may best
serve to pleasure you, and to remind you of this my trysting-tree?”

“i accept the offer,” said the knight, “as frankly as it is given; and i
ask permission to dispose of sir maurice de bracy at my own pleasure.”

“he is thine already,” said locksley, “and well for him! else the
tyrant had graced the highest bough of this oak, with as many of his
free-companions as we could gather, hanging thick as acorns around
him.--but he is thy prisoner, and he is safe, though he had slain my
father.”

“de bracy,” said the knight, “thou art free--depart. he whose prisoner
thou art scorns to take mean revenge for what is past. but beware of
the future, lest a worse thing befall th

de bracy bowed low and in silence, and was about to withdraw, when the
yeomen burst at once into a shout of execration and derision. the proud
knight instantly stopped, turned back, folded his arms, drew up his form
to its full height, and exclaimed, “peace, ye yelping curs! who open
upon a cry which ye followed not when the stag was at bay--de bracy
scorns your censure as he would disdain your applause. to your brakes

“those,” replied essex, “who are specially careless of their own
welfare, are seldom remarkably attentive to that of others--but let
us haste to the castle, for richard meditates punishing some of the
subordinate members of the conspiracy, though he has pardoned their
principal.”

from the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion, and
which are given at length in the wardour manuscript, it appears that
maurice de bracy escaped beyond seas, and went into the service of
philip of france; while philip de malvoisin, and his brother albert, the
preceptor of templestowe, were executed, although waldemar fitzurse, the
soul of the conspiracy, escaped with banishment; and prince john,
for whose behoof it was undertaken, was not even censured by his
good-natured brother. no one, however, pitied the fate of the two
malvoisins, who only suffered the death which they had both well
deserved, by many acts of falsehood, crue
