Sally
When Esperanza begins desiring boys, she seeks out a friend
in Sally, whom boys find desirable. Sally seems to be beautiful
and cruel, like the women Esperanza admires in movies. She leans
against the fence at school and doesn't talk to anyone. Rumors about
Sally's promiscuity circulate, but Esperanza doesn't believe them.
Instead, she thinks of Sally as a kindred spirit, someone who also
spends her time dreaming of escaping the neighborhood. Sally, however,
is not interested only in driving boys crazy and then laughing them
away, as the women in the movies do. Instead, she finds safety and
comfort in sex, feelings she does not find at home with her abusive
father. Sally's sexual exploits make Esperanza uncomfortable,
since at this point Esperanza is interested in sex only abstractly.
Eventually, this discomfort becomes extreme, and Sally ends up putting
Esperanza in physical danger. Sally herself changes little, but
Esperanza's understanding of her changes dramatically. Esperanza's
experiences as Sally's friend make Esperanza realize she has tried
to mature too quickly. In the end, Sally is a pitiable, not enviable,
figure in Esperanza's life.
