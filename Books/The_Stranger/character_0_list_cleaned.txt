[CHARACTER] - 
                 the
protagonist and narrator of the stranger, to whom
the novel's title refers. [CHARACTER] is a detached figure who views
and describes much of what occurs around him from a removed position.
he is emotionally indifferent to others, even to his mother and
his lover, marie. he also refuses to adhere to the accepted moral
order of society. after [CHARACTER] kills a man, "the arab," for no
apparent reason, he is put on trial. however, the focus of [CHARACTER]'s
murder trial quickly shifts away from the murder itself to [CHARACTER]'s
attitudes and beliefs. [CHARACTER]'s atheism and his lack of outward
grief at his mother's funeral represent a serious challenge to the
morals of the society in which he lives. consequently, society brands him
an outsider.
