[CHARACTER] - 
 aliens shaped like toilet plungers, each with one
hand containing an eye in its palm. the [CHARACTER]' philosophies
of time and death influence the narrative style of the novel. they
perceive time as an assemblage of moments existing simultaneously
rather than as a linear progression, and the episodic nature of slaughterhouse-five reflects
this notion of time. their acceptance of death, which billy embraces,
leads the narrator to remark simply "so it goes" at each mention
of death.
