 he had
forgotten), and incidentally a good watch. depending from the chain was
a large, yellowish elk's-tooth-proclamation of his membership in the
brotherly and protective order of elks. most significant of all was his
loose-leaf pocket note-book, that modern and efficient note-book
which contained the addresses of people whom he had forgotten, prudent
memoranda of postal money-orders which had reached their destinations
months ago, stamps which had lost their mucilage, clippings of verses by
t. cholmondeley frink and of the newspaper editorials from which babbitt
got his opinions and his polysyllables, notes to be sure and do things
which he did not intend to do, and one curious inscription--d.s.s.
d.m.y.p.d.f.

but he had no cigarette-case. no one had ever happened to give him
one, so he hadn't the habit, and people who carried cigarette-cases he
regarded as effeminate.

last, he stuck in his lapel the boosters' club button. with the
conciseness of great art the button displayed two words: "boosters-pe

d of the room was a heraldic and hooded stone fireplace which
the club's advertising-pamphlet asserted to be not only larger than any
of the fireplaces in european castles but of a draught incomparably more
scientific. it was also much cleaner, as no fire had ever been built in
it.

half of the tables were mammoth slabs which seated twenty or thirty men.
babbitt usually sat at the one near the door, with a group including
gunch, finkelstein, professor pumphrey, howard littlefield, his
neighbor, t. cholmondeley frink, the poet and advertising-agent, and
orville jones, whose laundry was in many ways the best in zenith. they
composed a club within the club, and merrily called themselves "the
roughnecks." to-day as he passed their table the roughnecks greeted him,
"come on, sit in! you 'n' paul too proud to feed with poor folks? afraid
somebody might stick you for a bottle of bevo, george? strikes me you
swells are getting awful darn exclusive!"

he thundered, "you bet! we can't afford to have our reps ruined

e guests were howard littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who
furnished publicity and comforting economics to the street traction
company; vergil gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the elks
and in the boosters' club; eddie swanson the agent for the javelin motor
car, who lived across the street; and orville jones, owner of the lily
white laundry, which justly announced itself "the biggest, busiest,
bulliest cleanerie shoppe in zenith." but, naturally, the most
distinguished of all was t. cholmondeley frink, who was not only the
author of "poemulations," which, syndicated daily in sixty-seven leading
newspapers, gave him one of the largest audiences of any poet in the
world, but also an optimistic lecturer and the creator of "ads that
add." despite the searching philosophy and high morality of his verses,
they were humorous and easily understood by any child of twelve; and it
added a neat air of pleasantry to them that they were set not as verse
but as prose. mr. frink was known from coast to coas

swell little hotel and a first-class ladies' ready-to-wear shop-real
perfection, in fact! you don't want to just look at what these small
towns are, you want to look at what they're aiming to become, and they
all got an ambition that in the long run is going to make 'em the finest
spots on earth--they all want to be just like zenith!"

however intimate they might be with t. cholmondeley frink as a neighbor,
as a borrower of lawn-mowers and monkey-wrenches, they knew that he was
also a famous poet and a distinguished advertising-agent; that behind
his easiness were sultry literary mysteries which they could not
penetrate. but to-night, in the gin-evolved confidence, he admitted them
to the arcanum:

"i've got a literary problem that's worrying me to death. i'm doing a
series of ads for the zeeco car and i want to make each of 'em a real
little gem--reg'lar stylistic stuff. i'm all fo

"yes," frink mused, "that's got an elegant color to it, if i do say
so, but it ain't got the originality of 'spill-of-speech!'" the whole
company sighed with sympathy and admiration.

babbitt was fond of his friends, he loved the importance of being host
and shouting, "certainly, you're going to have smore chicken--the idea!"
and he appreciated the genius of t. cholmondeley frink, but the vigor
of the cocktails was gone, and the more he ate the less joyful he
felt. then the amity of the dinner was destroyed by the nagging of the
swansons.

in floral heights and the other prosperous sections of zenith,
especially in the "young married set," there were many women who had
nothing to do. though they had few servants, yet with gas stoves,
electric ranges and dish-washers and vacuum cleaners, and tiled kitchen
walls, their houses were so convenient that they had little housew

blonde. when she condescended to be good-humored she was nervously
amusing. her comments on people were saltily satiric and penetrative of
accepted hypocrisies. "that's so!" you said, and looked sheepish. she
danced wildly, and called on the world to be merry, but in the midst of
it she would turn indignant. she was always becoming indignant. life was
a plot against her and she exposed it furiously.

she was affable to-night. she merely hinted that orville jones wore a
toupe, that mrs. t. cholmondeley frink's singing resembled a ford going
into high, and that the hon. otis deeble, mayor of zenith and candidate
for congress, was a flatulent fool (which was quite true). the babbitts
and rieslings sat doubtfully on stone-hard brocade chairs in the small
living-room of the flat, with its mantel unprovided with a fireplace,
and its strip of heavy gilt fabric upon a glaring new player-piano, till
mrs. riesling shrieked, "come on! let's put some pep in it! get out your
fiddle, paul, and i'll try to make

jever realize that?" at the athletic club he led unwilling men aside to
inquire, "say, if you had to read a paper before a big convention, would
you start in with the funny stories or just kind of scatter 'em all
through?" he asked howard littlefield for a "set of statistics about
real-estate sales; something good and impressive," and littlefield
provided something exceedingly good and impressive.

but it was to t. cholmondeley frink that babbitt most often turned. he
caught frink at the club every noon, and demanded, while frink
looked hunted and evasive, "say, chum--you're a shark on this
writing stuff--how would you put this sentence, see here in my
manuscript--manuscript now where the deuce is that?--oh, yes, here.
would you say 'we ought not also to alone think?' or 'we ought also not
to think alone?' or--"

one evening when his wife was away and he had no one to impress, babbitt
forgot about style, order, and the othe
