maria.
ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of
order.

sir toby.
confine! i'll confine myself no finer than i am. these clothes
are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they
be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.

maria.
that quaffing and drinking will undo you. i heard my lady talk of
it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in one

sir toby.
who, sir andrew aguecheek?

maria.
ay, he.

sir toby.
he's as tall a man as any's in illyria.

maria.

maria.

there is a passage in my throat and drink in illyria: he's a
coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece
till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish-top. what, wench!
castiliano vulgo! for here comes sir andrew agueface.

[enter sir andrew aguecheek.]

sir andrew.
sir toby belch; how now, sir toby belch!

sir toby.
sweet sir andrew!

sir andrew.
bless you, fair shrew.

maria.
and you too, sir.

sir toby.
accost, sir andrew, accost.

sir andrew.
what's that?

sir toby.
my niece's chambermaid.

sir andrew.
good mistress accost, i desire better acquaintance.

maria.
my name is mary, sir.

sir andrew.
good mistress mary accost,--

sir toby.
