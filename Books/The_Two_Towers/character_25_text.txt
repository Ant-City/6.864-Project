gain into the darkness of a deep winding valley on the other side.
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space. the moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the first light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind. for the moment aragorn was at a loss: the orc-trail had descended into the valley, but there it had vanished.
'which way would they turn, do you think?' said legolas. 'northward to take a straighter road to isengard, or fangorn, if that is their aim as you guess? or southward to strike the entwash?'
'they will not make for the river, whatever mark they aim at'' said aragorn. 'and unless there is much amiss in rohan and the power of saruman is greatly increased; they will take the shortest way that they can find over the fields of the rohirrim. let us search northwards!'
the dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills, and a trickling stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom. a cliff frowned upon their

 great ring, where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet. from it the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts of the hills. aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely.
'they rested here a while,' he said, 'but even the outward trail is already old. i fear that your heart spoke truly, legolas: it is thrice twelve hours, i guess, since the orcs stood where we now stand. if they held to their pace, then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of fangorn.'
'i can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,' said gimli. 'could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?'
'it is still far away,' said aragorn. 'if i remember rightly, these downs run eight leagues or more to the north, and then north-west to the issuing of the entwash there lies still a wide land. another fifteen leagues it may be.'
'well, let us go on,' said gimli. 'my legs must forget the miles. they would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.'

g the white stars opened in the hard black vault above. so the night passed. together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky, now bare and cloudless, until at last the sunrise came. it was pale and clear. the wind was in the east and all the mists had rolled away; wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light.
ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the wold of rohan that they had already glimpsed many days ago from the great river. north-westward stalked the dark forest of fangorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy eaves, and its further slopes faded into the distant blue. beyond there glimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall methedras, the last peak of the misty mountains. out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks deep-cloven. the orc-trail turned from the downs towards it.
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river back towards the forest, arago

ward trail is fresh and clear. there is no sign there of any feet going the other way, back towards anduin. now we must ride slower, and make sure that no trace or footstep branches off on either side. the orcs must have been aware from this point that they were pursued; they may have made some attempt to get their captives away before they were overtaken.'
as they rode forward the day was overcast. low grey clouds came over the wold. a mist shrouded the sun. ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of fangorn loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. they saw no sign of any trail to right or left, but here and there they passed single orcs, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-feathered arrows sticking in back or throat.
at last as the afternoon was waning they came to the eaves of the forest, and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place of the great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking. beside it was a great pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken

gimli shivered. they had brought only one blanket apiece. 'let us light a fire,' he said. 'i care no longer for the danger. let the orcs come as thick as summer-moths round a candle!'
'if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw them hither,' said legolas.
'and it might draw other things, neither orc nor hobbit,' said aragorn. 'we are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor saruman. also we are on the very edge of fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood, it is said.'
'but the rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday,' said gimli, 'and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen. yet they passed the night after safely here, when their labour was ended.'
'they were many,' said aragorn, 'and they do not heed the wrath of fangorn, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under the trees. but our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself. so have a care! cut no living woo

ly to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this way and that so as to come above the flames, while the upper branches were stooping down; the brown leaves now stood out stiff, and rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth.
there was a silence, for suddenly the dark and unknown forest, so near at hand, made itself felt as a great brooding presence, full of secret purpose. after a while legolas spoke again.
'celeborn warned us not to go far into fangorn,' he said. 'do you know why, aragorn? what are the fables of the forest that boromir had heard?'
'i have heard many tales in gondor and elsewhere,' said aragorn, 'but if it were not for the words of celeborn i should deem them only fables that men have made as true knowledge fades. i had thought of asking you what was the truth of the matter. and if an elf of the wood does not know, how shall a man answer?'
'you have journeyed further than i,' said legolas. 'i have heard nothing of this in my o

wn land, save only songs that tell how the onodrim, that men call ents, dwelt there long ago; for fangorn is old, old even as the elves would reckon it.'
'yes, it is old,' said aragorn, 'as old as the forest by the barrow-downs, and it is far greater. elrond says that the two are akin, the last strongholds of the mighty woods of the elder days, in which the firstborn roamed while men still slept. yet fangorn holds some secret of its own. what it is i do not know.'
'and i do not wish to know,' said gimli. 'let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubled on my account!'
they now drew lots for the watches, and the lot for the first watch fell to gimli. the others lay down. almost at once sleep laid hold on them. 'gimli!' said aragorn drowsily. 'remember, it is perilous to cut bough or twig from a living tree in fangorn. but do not stray far in search of dead wood. let the fire die rather! call me at ne

agorn, leaping to his feet. 'come and be warm, if you are cold!' he strode forward, but the old man was gone. there was no trace of him to be found near at hand, and they did not dare to wander far. the moon had set and the night was very dark.
suddenly legolas gave a cry. 'the horses! the horses!'
the horses were gone. they had dragged their pickets and disappeared. for me time the three companions stood still and silent, troubled by this new stroke of ill fortune. they were under the eaves of fangorn, and endless leagues lay between them and the men of rohan, their only friends in this wide and dangerous land. as they stood, it seemed to them that they heard, far off in the night. the sound of horses whinnying and neighing. then all was quiet again, except for the cold rustle of the wind.
'well, they are gone,' said aragorn at last. 'we cannot find them or catch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we must do without. we started on our feet, and we have those still.'

'i shall have to brush up my toes, if i am to get level with you. indeed cousin brandybuck is going in front now. this is where he comes in. i don't suppose you have much notion where we are; but i spent my time at rivendell rather better. we are walking west along the entwash. the butt-end of the misty mountains is in front, and fangorn forest.'
even as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before them. night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees, creeping away from the coming dawn.
'lead on, master brandybuck!' said pippin. 'or lead back! we have been warned against fangorn. but one so knowing will not have forgotten that.'
'i have not,' answered merry; 'but the forest seems better to me, all the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.'

olutely in the direction of the forest. straight up the slope they charged towards the watchers. now they were drawing near, and it seemed certain that they would escape: they had already hewn down three riders that barred their way.
'we have watched too long,' said merry. 'there's uglúk! i don't want to meet him again.' the hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood.
so it was that they did not sec the last stand, when uglúk was overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of fangorn. there he was slain at last by éomer, the third marshal of the mark, who dismounted and fought him sword to sword. and over the wide fields the keen-eyed riders hunted down the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly.
then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung their praises, the riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies. so ended the raid, and no news of it came ever back either to mordor or to isengard; but the smoke of the bu

meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled forest allowed, following the line of the running stream, westward and up towards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into fangorn. slowly their fear of the orcs died away, and their pace slackened. a queer stifling feeling came over them, as if the air were too thin or too scanty for breathing.
at last merry halted. 'we can't go on like this,' he panted. 'i want some air.'
'let's have a drink at any rate,' said pippin. 'i'm parched.' he clambered on to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream, and stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. it was clear and cold, and he took many draughts. merry followed him

pippin, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. under those eyes he felt a curious suspense, but not fear. 'please.' he said, 'who are you? and what are you?'
a queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep wells were covered over. 'hrum, now,' answered the voice; 'well, i am an ent, or that's what they call me. yes, ent is the word. the ent, i am, you might say, in your manner of speaking. fangorn is my name according to some, treebeard others make it. treebeard will do.'
'an ent?' said merry. 'what's that? but what do you call yourself? what's your real name?'
'hoo now!' replied treebeard. 'hoo! now that would be telling! not so hasty. and i am doing the asking. you are in my country. what are you, i wonder? i cannot place you. you do not seem to come in the old lists that i learned when i was young. but that was a long, long time ago, and they may have made new lists. let me see! let m

he ended, and strode on silently, and in all the wood, as far as ear could reach, there was not a sound.
the day waned, and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees. at last the hobbits saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall methedras. down the hillside the young entwash, leaping from its springs high above, ran noisi

he strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain of the spring. then he laughed and shook himself, and wherever the drops of water fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green sparks. he came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent.
after some time the hobbits heard him murmuring again. he seemed to be counting on his fingers. 'fangorn, finglas, fladrif, aye, aye,' he sighed. 'the trouble is that there are so few of us left,' he said turning towards the hobbits. 'only three remain of the first ents that walked in the woods before the darkness: only myself, fangorn, and finglas and fladrif - to give them their elvish names; you may call them leaflock and skinbark if you like that better. and of us three leaflock and skinbark are not much use for this business. leaflock has grown sleepy, almost tree-ish, you might say: he has t

t, stepped over the stream, and strode away southwards along the feet of great tumbled slopes where trees were scanty. above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods. soon treebeard turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves, where the trees were larger, taller, and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before. for a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first ventured into fangorn, but it soon passed. treebeard did not talk to them. he hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully, but merry and pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar boom, and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. now and again they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of the earth, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of the trees; but treebeard did not sto

ay southward; now they began to climb up, and up, on to the high western ridge. the woods fell away and they came to scattered groups of birch, and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine-trees grew. the sun sank behind the dark hill-back in front. grey dusk fell.
pippin looked behind. the number of the ents had grown - or what was happening? where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie, he thought he saw groves of trees. but they were moving! could it be that the trees of fangorn were awake, and the forest was rising, marching over the hills to war? he rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived him; but the great grey shapes moved steadily onward. there was a noise like wind in many branches. the ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge now, and all song had ceased. night fell, and there was silence: nothing was to be heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the feet of the ents, and a rustle, the shade of a whisper as of many drifting leaves.

'because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he seemed,' answered the dwarf.
'maybe,' said the elf; 'but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the grass is deep and springy.'
'that would not baffle a ranger,' said gimli. 'a bent blade is enough for aragorn to read. but i do not expect him to find any traces. it was an evil phantom of saruman that we saw last night. i am sure of it, even under the light of morning. his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now, maybe.'
'it is likely enough,' said aragorn; 'yet i am not sure. i am thinking of the horses. you said last night, gimli, that they were scared away. but i did not think so. did you hear them, legolas? did they sound to you like beasts in terror?'
'no,' said legolas. 'i heard them clearly. but for the darkness and our own fear i should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness. they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have long missed.'

had been commanded to capture hobbits, alive, at all costs. an attempt was made to slip out with the precious prisoners before the battle. treachery perhaps, likely enough with such folk; some large and bold orc may have been trying to escape with the prize alone, for his own ends. there, that is my tale. others might be devised. but on this we may count in any case: one at least of our friends escaped. it is our task to find him and help him before we return to rohan. we must not be daunted by fangorn, since need drove him into that dark place.'
'i do not know which daunts me more: fangorn, or the thought of the long road through rohan on foot,' said gimli.
'then let us go to the forest,' said aragorn.
it was not long before aragorn found fresh signs. at one point, near the bank of the entwash, he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints, but too light for much to be made of them. then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. the earth was b

'one hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back; and then he turned away into the forest,' said aragorn.
'then we must go in, too,' said gimli. 'but i do not like the look of this fangorn: and we were warned against it. i wish the chase had led anywhere else!'
'i do not think the wood feels evil, whatever tales may say,' said legolas. he stood under the eaves of the forest, stooping forward, as if he were listening, and peering with wide eyes into the shadows. 'no, it is not evil; or what evil is in it is far away. i catch only the faintest echoes of dark places where the hearts of the trees are black. there is no malice near us; but there is watchfulness, and anger.'

'i dare say you could,' snorted gimli. 'you are a wood-elf, anyway, though elves of any kind are strange folk. yet you comfort me. where you go, i will go. but keep your bow ready to hand, and i will keep my axe loose in my belt. not for use on trees,' he added hastily, looking up at the tree under which they stood. 'i do not wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready to hand, that is all. let us go!'
with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn. legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn. there was little for him to see. the floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks of the stream. so it was that he came upon the place where merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet. there plain for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other.
'this is good tidings,' said aragorn. 'yet the mar

'then what shall we do now?' said gimli. 'we cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fangorn. we have come ill supplied. if we do not find them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and show our friendship by starving together.'
'if that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,' said aragorn. 'let us go on.'
they came at length to the steep abrupt end of treebeard's hill and looked up at the rock-wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf. gleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouds, and the forest now looked less grey and drear.

aw nothing that was of any use. the shelf faced southward and eastward; but only on the east was the view open. there he could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards the plain from which they had come.
'we have journeyed a long way round,' said legolas. 'we could have all come here safe together, if we had left the great river on the second or third day and struck west. few can foresee whither their road will lead them, till they come to its end.'
'but we did not wish to come to fangorn,' said gimli.
'yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net,' said legolas. 'look!'
'look at what?' said gimli.
'there in the trees.'
'where? i have not elf-eyes.'
'hush! speak more softly! look!' said legolas pointing. 'down in the wood, back in the way that we have just come. it is he. cannot you see him, passing from tree to tree?'
'i see, i see now!' hissed gimli. 'look, aragorn! did i not warn you? there is the old man. all in dirty grey rags: that is why i could not see him at first.'

'well met, i say again!' said the old man, coming towards them. when he was a few feet away, he stood, stooping over his staff, with his head thrust forward, peering at them from under his hood. 'and what may you be doing in these parts? an elf, a man, and a dwarf. all clad in elvish fashion. no doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all. such things are not often seen here.'
'you speak as one that knows fangorn well,' said aragorn. 'is that so?'
'not well,' said the old man: 'that would be the study of many lives. but i come here now and again.'
'might we know your name, and then hear what it is that you have to say to us?' said aragorn. 'the morning passes, and we have an errand that will not wait.'
'as for what i wished to say, i have said it: what may you be doing, and what tale can you tell of yourselves? as for my name!' he broke off, laughing long and softly. aragorn felt a shudder run through h

nd of his last journey upon the great river, the old man sighed.
'you have not said all that you know or guess, aragorn my friend,' he said quietly. 'poor boromir! i could not see what happened to him. it was a sore trial for such a man: a warrior, and a lord of men. galadriel told me that he was in peril. but he escaped in the end. i am glad. it was not in vain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for boromir's sake. but that is not the only part they have to play. they were brought to fangorn, and their coming was like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains. even as we talk here, i hear the first rumblings. saruman had best not be caught away from home when the dam bursts!'
'in one thing you have not changed, dear friend,' said aragorn: 'you still speak in riddles.'
'what? in riddles?' said gandalf. 'no! for i was talking aloud to myself. a habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to speak to; the long explanations needed by the young ar

'also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their plans. no tidings of the battle will come to mordor, thanks to the horsemen of rohan; but the dark lord knows that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and borne away towards isengard against the will of his own servants. he now has isengard to fear as well as minas tirith. if minas tirith falls, it will go ill with saruman.'

'now you speak to yourself again,' said aragorn with a smile. 'treebeard is not known to me. and i have guessed part of saruman's double treachery; yet i do not see in what way the coming of two hobbits to fangorn has served, save to give us a long and fruitless chase.'
'wait a minute!' cried gimli. 'there is another thing that i should like to know first. was it you, gandalf, or saruman that we saw last night?'
'you certainly did not see me,' answered gandalf, 'therefore i must guess that you saw saruman. evidently we look so much alike that your desire to make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused.'
'good, good!' said gimli. 'i am glad that it was not you.'

'ah! now you are asking much,' said gandalf. 'the little that i know of his long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now. treebeard is fangorn, the guardian of the forest; he is the oldest of the ents, the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the sun upon this middle-earth. i hope indeed, legolas, that you may yet meet him. merry and pippin have been fortunate: they met him here, even w

'perhaps he also thought that you were saruman,' said gimli. 'but you speak of him as if he was a friend. i thought fangorn was dangerous.'
'dangerous!' cried gandalf. 'and so am i, very dangerous: more dangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive before the seat of the dark lord. and aragorn is dangerous, and legolas is dangerous. you are beset with dangers, gimli son of glóin; for you are dangerous yourself, in your own fashion. certainly the forest of fangorn is perilous-not least to those that are too ready with their axes; and fangorn himself, he is perilous too; yet he is wise and

'that will not be far to seek,' said gandalf, rising from his seat. 'come! we have spent all the time that is allowed to a meeting of parted friends. now there is need of haste.'
he wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak, and led the way. following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way back through the forest, down the bank of the entwash. they spoke no more words, until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn. there was no sign of their horses to be seen.
'they have not returned,' said legolas. 'it will be a weary walk!'
'i shall not walk. time presses,' said gandalf. then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle. so clear and piercing was the note that the others stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips. three times he whistled; and then faint and far off it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern wind. they waited w

'no, no!' said gimli. 'let us leave them! i guess their thought already: hatred of all that go on two legs; and their speech is of crushing and strangling.'
'not of all that go on two legs,' said legolas. 'there i think you are wrong. it is orcs that they hate. for they do not belong here and know little of elves and men. far away are the valleys where they sprang. from the deep dales of fangorn, gimli, that is whence they come, i guess.'
'then that is the most perilous wood in middle-earth,' said gimli.

'i have never heard you speak like this before. almost you make me regret that i have not seen these caves. come! let us make this bargain-if we both return safe out of the perils that await us, we will journey for a while together. you shall visit fangorn with me, and then i will come with you to see helm's deep.'
'that would not be the way of return that i should choose,' said gimli. 'but i will endure fangorn, if i have your promise to come back to the caves and share their wonder with me.'
'you have my promise,' said legolas. 'but alas! now we must leave behind both cave and wood for a while: see! we are coming to the end of the trees. how far is it to isengard, gandalf?'

 but a mile below the dike a huge pit had been delved in the earth, and over it stones were piled into a hill. men believed that the orcs whom they had slain were buried there; but whether those who had fled into the wood were with them, none could say, for no man ever set foot upon that hill. the death down it was afterwards called, and no grass would grow there. but the strange trees were never seen in deeping-coomb again; they had returned at night, and had gone far away to the dark dales of fangorn. thus they were revenged upon the orcs.
the king and his company slept no more that night; but they saw and heard no other strange thing, save one: the voice of the river beside them suddenly awoke. there was a rush of water hurrying down among the stones; and when it had passed, the isen flowed and bubbled in its bed again, as it had ever done.
at dawn they made ready to go on. the light came grey and pale, and they did not see the rising of the sun. the air above was heavy with fog, and a ree

 many other questions. i was to say that, if the lord of the mark and gandalf will ride to the northern wall they will find treebeard there, and he will welcome them. i may add that they will also find food of the best there, it was discovered and selected by your humble servants.' he bowed.
gandalf laughed. 'that is better!' he said. 'well, théoden. will you ride with me to find treebeard? we must go round about, but it is not far. when you see treebeard, you will learn much. for treebeard is fangorn, and the eldest and chief of the ents, and when you speak with him you will hear the speech of the oldest of all living things.'
'i will come with you,' said théoden. 'farewell, my hobbits! may we meet again in my house! there you shall sit beside me and tell me all that your hearts desire: the deeds of your grandsires, as far as you can reckon them; and we will speak also of tobold the old and his herb-lore. farewell!'
the hobbits bowed low. 'so that is the king of rohan!' said pippin in an u

at, if that is possible for hobbits of your age. this treebeard at any rate has not starved you.'
'he has not,' said merry. 'but ents only drink, and drink is not enough for content. treebeard's draughts may be nourishing, but one feels the need of something solid. and even lembas is none the worse for a change.'
'you have drunk of the waters of the ents, have you?' said legolas. 'ah, then i think it is likely that gimli's eyes do not deceive him. strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn.'
'many strange tales have been told about that land,' said aragorn. 'i have never entered it. come, tell me more about it, and about the ents!'
'ents,' said pippin, 'ents are - well ents are all different for on thing. but their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.' he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence. 'oh, well,' he went on, 'you have seen some at a distance, already-they saw you at any rate, and reported that you were on the way-and you will see many others, i expect, b

ed at them in wonder.
'here are three of my companions, treebeard,' said gandalf. 'i have spoken of them, but you have not yet seen them.' he named them one by one.
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly, and spoke to them in turn. last he turned to legolas. 'so you have come all the way from mirkwood, my good elf? a very great forest it used to be!'
'and still is,' said legolas. 'but not so great that we who dwell there ever tire of seeing new trees. i should dearly love to journey in fangorn's wood. i scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and i did not wish to turn back.'
treebeard's eyes gleamed with pleasure. 'i hope you may have your wish, ere the hills be much older,' he said.
'i will come, if i have the fortune,' said legolas. 'i have made a bargain with my friend that, if all goes well, we will visit fangorn together - by your leave.'
'any elf that comes with you will be welcome,' said treebeard.
'the friend i speak of is not an elf,' said legolas; 'i mean gimli, glóin's s

on here.' gimli bowed low, and the axe slipped from his belt and clattered on the ground.
'hoom, hm! ah now,' said treebeard, looking dark-eyed at him. 'a dwarf and an axe-bearer! hoom! i have good will to elves; but you ask much. this is a strange friendship!' 'strange it may seem,' said legolas; 'but while gimli lives i shall not come to fangorn alone. his axe is not for trees, but for orc-necks, o fangorn, master of fangorn's wood. forty-two he hewed in the battle.'
'hoo! come now!' said treebeard. 'that is a better story! well, well, things will go as they will; and there is no need to hurry to meet them. but now we must part for a while. day is drawing to an end, yet gandalf says you must go ere nightfall, and the lord of the mark is eager for his own house.'
'yes, we must go, and go now,' said gandalf. 'i fear that i must take your gatekeepers from you. but you will manage well enough without them.'
'maybe i sh

thers followed at an easy pace.
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long arms uplifted, but they made no sound. merry and pippin looked back, when they had passed some way down the winding road. sunlight was still shining in the sky, but long shadows reached over isengard: grey ruins falling into darkness. treebeard stood alone there now, like the distant stump of an old tree: the hobbits thought of their first meeting, upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of fangorn.
they came to the pillar of the white hand. the pillar was still standing, but the graven hand had been thrown down and broken into small pieces. right in the middle of the road the long forefinger lay, white in the dusk, its red nail darkening to black.
'the ents pay attention to every detail!' said gandalf.
they rode on, and evening deepened in the valley.
'are we riding far tonight, gandalf?' asked merry after a while. 'i don't know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you; but th
