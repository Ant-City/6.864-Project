eyed by their subjects,--and that
is what you call justice?

doubtless.

then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to the
interest of the stronger but the reverse?

what is that you are saying? he asked.

i am only repeating what you are saying, i believe. but let us consider:
have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own
interest in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice?
has not that been admitted?

yes.

then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest
of the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to be
done which are to their own injury. for if, as you say, justice is the
obedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, o
wisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker
are commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the
injury of the stronger?

nothing can be clearer, socrates, said polemarchus.

yes, said cleitophon, interposi

ng, if you are allowed to be his witness.

but there is no need of any witness, said polemarchus, for thrasymachus
himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for
their own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is justice.

yes, polemarchus,--thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was
commanded by their rulers is just.

yes, cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest of the
stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further
acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his
subjects to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that
justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.

but, said cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what the
stronger thought to be his interest,--this was what the weaker had to
do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice.

those were not his words, rejoined polemarchus.

never mind, i replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept

?

yes, that is the aim of art.

and the interest of any art is the perfection of it--this and nothing
else?

what do you mean?

i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.
suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has
wants, i should reply: certainly the body has wants; for the body may
be ill and require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which
the art of medicine ministers; and this is the origin and intention of
medicine, as you will acknowledge. am i not right?

quite right, he replied.

but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any
quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the
ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide
for the interests of seeing and hearing--has art in itself, i say, any
similar liability to fault or defect, and does every art require another
supplementary art to provide for its interests, and that another and
another without end? or have the a

determine the way of man's life so small a matter in your eyes--to
determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest
advantage?

and do i differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?

you appear rather, i replied, to have no care or thought about us,
thrasymachus--whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you
say you know, is to you a matter of indifference. prithee, friend,
do not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any
benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. for my own
part i openly declare that i am not convinced, and that i do not believe
injustice to be more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled and
allowed to have free play. for, granting that there may be an unjust
man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force, still this
does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice, and there
may be others who are in the same

the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the

i do not think that he would.

but he would claim to exceed the non-musician?

of course.

and what would you say of the physician? in prescribing meats and drinks
would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of
medicine?

he would not.

but he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?

yes.

and about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think that
any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying
or doing more than another man who has knowledge. would he not rather
say or do the same as his like in the same case?

that, i suppose, can hardly be denied.

and what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either
the knowing or the ignorant?

i dare say.

and the knowing is wise?

yes.

and the wise is good?

true.

then the wise and good will not desire

 than to be unjust?

i should wish really to persuade you, i replied, if i could.

then you certainly have not succeeded. let me ask you now:--how would
you arrange goods--are there not some which we welcome for their
own sakes, and independently of their consequences, as, for example,
harmless pleasures and enjoyments, which delight us at the time,
although nothing follows from them?

i agree in thinking that there is such a class, i replied.

is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight,
health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their
results?

certainly, i said.

and would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the
care of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of
money-making--these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and
no one would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the sake of
some reward or result which flows from them?

there is, i said, this third class also. but why do you ask?

please, then, i will revive the argument of thrasymachus. and first i
will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common
view of them. secondly, i will show that all men who practise justice do
so against their will, of necessity, but not as a good. and thirdly, i
will argue that there is reason in this view, for the life of the unjust
is after all better far than the life of the just--if what they say
is true, socrates, since i myself am not of their opinion. but still i
acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus
and myriads of others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, i have
never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by
any one in a satisfactory way. i want to hear justice praised in respect
of itself; then i shall be satisfied, and you are the person from whom
i think that i am most likely to hear this; and therefore i will praise
the unjust life to the utmost of my power, and my manner of speaking

honour justice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice
praised? and even if there should be some one who is able to disprove
the truth of my words, and who is satisfied that justice is best, still
he is not angry with the unjust, but is very ready to forgive them,
because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will;
unless, peradventure, there be some one whom the divinity within him may
have inspired with a hatred of injustice, or who has attained knowledge
of the truth--but no other man. he only blames injustice who, owing to
cowardice or age or some weakness, has not the power of being unjust.
and this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power, he
immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be.

the cause of all this, socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning of
the argument, when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to
find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice--beginning with
the ancient heroes of whom a

appearance of it; we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep
injustice dark, and that you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking
that justice is another's good and the interest of the stronger, and
that injustice is a man's own profit and interest, though injurious to
the weaker. now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest
class of goods which are desired indeed for their results, but in a far
greater degree for their own sakes--like sight or hearing or knowledge
or health, or any other real and natural and not merely conventional
good--i would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point
only: i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice
work in the possessors of them. let others praise justice and censure
injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the
other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them, i am
ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in the

and our state must once more enlarge; and this time the enlargement will
be nothing short of a whole army, which will have to go out and fight
with the invaders for all that we have, as well as for the things and
persons whom we were describing above.

why? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?

no, i said; not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged
by all of us when we were framing the state: the principle, as you will
remember, was that one man cannot practise many arts with success.

very true, he said.

but is not war an art?

certainly.

and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?

quite true.

and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be a husbandman, or a weaver,
or a builder--in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to
him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by
nature fitted, and

the matter never struck me before; but i quite recognise the truth of
your remark.

true philosopher.

why?

why, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only
by the criterion of knowing and not knowing. and must not an animal be a
lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test
of knowledge and ignorance?

most assuredly.

and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?

they are the same, he replied.

and may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be
gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of
wisdom and knowledge?

that we may safely affirm.

then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will
require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and
strength?

a chain around ares and aphrodite?

indeed, he said, i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear
that sort of thing.

but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men, these
they ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the verses,

'he smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart, endure, my heart;
far worse hast thou endured!'

of money.

certainly not.

neither must we sing to them of

'gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings.'

neither is phoenix, the tutor of achilles, to be approved or deemed to
have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take
the gifts of the greeks and assist them; but that without a gift he
should not lay aside his anger. neither will we believe or acknowledge
achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took
agamemnon's gifts, or that when he had received payment he restored the
dead body of hector, but that without payment he was unwilling to do so.

undoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be approved.

loving homer as i do, i hardly like to say that in attributing these
feelings to achilles, or in believing that they are truly attributed
to him, he is guilty of downright impiety. as little can i believe the

that is obvious.

every one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are to
be consistent with ourselves.

i fear, said glaucon, laughing, that the word 'every one' hardly
includes me, for i cannot at the moment say what they should be; though
i may guess.

at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts--the words,
the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge i may presuppose?

yes, he said; so much as that you may.

and as for the words, there will surely be no difference between words
which are and which are not set to music; both will conform to the same
laws, and these have been already determined by us?

yes.

and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?

certainly.

we were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no need
of lamentation and strains of sorrow?

true.

subjects, whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others; the
art of medicine was not designed for their good, and though they were as
rich as midas, the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them.

they were very acute persons, those sons of asclepius.

naturally so, i replied. nevertheless, the tragedians and pindar
disobeying our behests, although they acknowledge that asclepius was the
son of apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man
who was at the point of death, and for this reason he was struck by
lightning. but we, in accordance with the principle already affirmed by
us, will not believe them when they tell us both;--if he was the son of
a god, we maintain that he was not avaricious; or, if he was avaricious,
he was not the son of a god.

all that, socrates, is excellent; but i should like to put a question to

and bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who are
acquainted with all sorts of moral natures?

yes, i said, i too would have good judges and good physicians. but do
you know whom i think good?

will you tell me?

i will, if i can. let me however note that in the same question you join
two things which are not the same.

how so? he asked.

why, i said, you join physicians and judges. now the most skilful
physicians are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined with
the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease; they
had better not be robust in health, and should have had all manner of
diseases in their own persons. for the body, as i conceive, is not the
instrument with which they cure the body; in that case we could not
allow them ever to be or to have been sickly; but they cure the body
with the mind, and the mind which has become and is sick can cure
nothing.

that is very true, he said.

but with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by m

judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits
when young. and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to
be simple, and are easily practised upon by the dishonest, because they
have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.

yes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.

therefore, i said, the judge should not be young; he should have learned
to know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation
of the nature of evil in others: knowledge should be his guide, not
personal experience.

yes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.

yes, i replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your
question); for he is good who has a good soul. but the cunning and
suspicious nature of which we spoke,--he who has committed many crimes,
and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst
his fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he
judges of them by himself: but when he gets into the comp

owing to his unseasonable suspicions; he cannot recognise an honest man,
because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time, as
the bad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them oftener,
he thinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise than
foolish.

most true, he said.

then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but
the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature,
educated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice: the
virtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom--in my opinion.

and in mine also.

this is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you
will sanction in your state. they will minister to better natures,
giving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in
their bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls
they will put an end to themselves.

that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state.

ntment?

still, he replied, i do not understand you.

i fear that i must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians. i only
mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget;
argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the other; and
this i call theft. now you understand me?

yes.

those again who are forced, are those whom the violence of some pain or
grief compels to change their opinion.

i understand, he said, and you are quite right.

and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change
their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the
sterner influence of fear?

yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.

therefore, as i was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best
guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest
of the state is to be the rule of their lives. we must watch them from
their youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are
most likely to forget o

certain that they ought to be, and that true education, whatever that
may be, will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them
in their relations to one another, and to those who are under their
protection.

very true, he replied.

and not only their education, but their habitations, and all that
belongs to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue as
guardians, nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens. any man of
sense must acknowledge that.

he must.

then now let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are to
realize our idea of them. in the first place, none of them should have
any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary; neither
should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has
a mind to enter; their provisions should be only such as are required
by trained warriors, who are men of temperance and courage; they should
agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay,

no further trouble; or we might know the other
three first, and then the fourth would clearly be the one left.

very true, he said.

and is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are
also four in number?

clearly.

first among the virtues found in the state, wisdom comes into view, and
in this i detect a certain peculiarity.

what is that?

the state which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good
in counsel?

very true.

and good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance,
but by knowledge, do men counsel well?

clearly.

and the kinds of knowledge in a state are many and diverse?

of course.

there is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of
knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?

certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill in
carpentering.

then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge
which counsels for the best about wooden implements?

certainly no

t.

nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, i said,
nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?

not by reason of any of them, he said.

nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would
give the city the name of agricultural?

yes.

well, i said, and is there any knowledge in our recently-founded state
among any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing
in the state, but about the whole, and considers how a state can best
deal with itself and with other states?

there certainly is.

and what is this knowledge, and among whom is it found? i asked.

it is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and is found among
those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.

and what is the name which the city derives from the possession of t
 
 ___________________________
 
his
sort of knowledge?

the name of good in counsel and truly wise.

and will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more
smiths?

the smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.

will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a
name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?

much the smallest.

and so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge
which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole
state, being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and
this, which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been
ordained by nature to be of all classes the least.

most true.

thus, then, i said, the nature and place in the state of one of the four
virtues has somehow or other been discovered.

and, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.

again, i said, there is no diffic

has the worse under control,
then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term of
praise: but when, owing to evil education or association, the better
principle, which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater mass
of the worse--in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self
and unprincipled.

yes, there is reason in that.

and now, i said, look at our newly-created state, and there you will
find one of these two conditions realized; for the state, as you
will acknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words
'temperance' and 'self-mastery' truly express the rule of the better
part over the worse.

yes, he said, i see that what you say is true.

let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires
and pains are generally found in children and women and servants, and in
the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class.

certainly, he said.

whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are
un

the good.

very true, i said; and i do not think that the method which we are
employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question;
the true method is another and a longer one. still we may arrive at a
solution not below the level of the previous enquiry.

may we not be satisfied with that? he said;--under the circumstances, i
am quite content.

i too, i replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.

then faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.

must we not acknowledge, i said, that in each of us there are the same
principles and habits which there are in the state; and that from the
individual they pass into the state?--how else can they come there? take
the quality of passion or spirit;--it would be ridiculous to imagine
that this quality, when found in states, is not derived from the
individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the thracians,
scythians, and in general the northern nations; and the same may be said
of the love of knowledge, which is the

and the much greater to the much less?

yes.

and the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is
to be to the less that is to be?

certainly, he said.

and so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as the
double and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter
and the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives;--is not
this true of all of them?

yes.

and does not the same principle hold in the sciences? the object of
science is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but
the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge;
i mean, for example, that the science of house-building is a kind of
knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is
therefore termed architecture.

certainly.

because it has a particular quality which no other has?

yes.

and it has this particular quality because it has an object of a
particular kind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences?

yes.

 
 ___________________________
 
 same principles which exist in the state exist also in the
individual, and that they are three in number.

exactly.

must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, and
in virtue of the same quality which makes the state wise?

certainly.

also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the state
constitutes courage in the individual, and that both the state and the
individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?

assuredly.

and the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way
in which the state is just?

that follows, of course.

we cannot but remember that the justice of the state consisted in each
of the three classes doing the work of its own class?

we are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.

we must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of
his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?

yes, he said, we must remember that too.

and ought not the rational principle, which is wi

rs of the whole soul and
the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and
the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his
commands and counsels?

true.

and he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and
in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear?

right, he replied.

and him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and
which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a
knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of
the whole?

assuredly.

and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements
in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and
the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason
ought to rule, and do not rebel?

certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in
the state or individual.

and surely, i said, we have explained again and again how and by virtu

a matter of property, or in the treatment of the body, or in some affair
of politics or private business; always thinking and calling that which
preserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition, just and good
action, and the knowledge which presides over it, wisdom, and that which
at any time impairs this condition, he will call unjust action, and the
opinion which presides over it ignorance.

you have said the exact truth, socrates.

very good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man
and the just state, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should
not be telling a falsehood?

most certainly not.

may we say so, then?

let us say so.

why yes, i said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth,
whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean, he
has to swim all the same.

very true.

and must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope that
arion's dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?

i suppose so, he said.

well then, let us see if any way of escape can be found. we

round again.

certainly not.

the law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, and therefore not
an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice, which
prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.

that appears to be true.

we had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and
secondly whether they were the most beneficial?

yes.

and the possibility has been acknowledged?

yes.

the very great benefit has next to be established?

quite so.

you will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian
will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the
same?

yes.

i should like to ask you a question.

what is it?

would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better
than another?

the latter.

and in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the
guardians who have been brought up on our model system
 
 ___________________________
 
terest they will have a
common feeling of pleasure and pain?

yes, far more so than in other states.

and the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the
state, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and
children?

that will be the chief reason.

and this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was
implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered state to the relation of
the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?

that we acknowledged, and very rightly.

then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly
the source of the greatest good to the state?

certainly.

and this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming,--that
the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property;
their pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from the
other citizens, and they were to have no private expenses; for we
intended them to preserve their true character of guardians.

right, he

to the barbarians?

very good, he said.

and therefore when hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with
hellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight,
and by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called war;
but when hellenes fight with one another we shall say that hellas is
then in a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature friends;
and such enmity is to be called discord.

i agree.

consider then, i said, when that which we have acknowledged to be
discord occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the lands
and burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife appear!
no true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his
own nurse and mother: there might be reason in the conqueror depriving
the conquered of their harvest, but still they would have the idea of
peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever.

yes, he said, that is a better temper than the other.

and will no

 us enact this law also for our guardians:--that they are
neither to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses.

agreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, like all our
previous enactments, are very good.

but still i must say, socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in
this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the
commencement of this discussion you thrust aside:--is such an order of
things possible, and how, if at all? for i am quite ready to acknowledge
that the plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts of
good to the state. i will add, what you have omitted, that your citizens
will be the bravest of warriors, and will never leave their ranks, for
they will all know one another, and each will call the other father,
brother, son; and if you suppose the women to join their armies, whether
in the same rank or in the rear, either as a terror to the enemy, or as
auxiliaries in case of need, i know that they will then be absolutel

invincible; and there are many domestic advantages which might also be
mentioned and which i also fully acknowledge: but, as i admit all these
advantages and as many more as you please, if only this state of yours
were to come into existence, we need say no more about them; assuming
then the existence of the state, let us now turn to the question of
possibility and ways and means--the rest may be left.

if i loiter for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me, i said, and
have no mercy; i have hardly escaped the first and second waves, and you
seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the thi
 
 ___________________________
 
rd, which
is the greatest and heaviest. when you have seen and heard the third
wave, i think you will be more considerate and will acknowledge
that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so
extraordinary as that which i have now to state and investigate.

the more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the more
determined are we that you shall tell us how such a state is possible:
speak out and at once.

let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search
after justice and injustice.

true, he replied; but what of that?

i was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are
 
 ___________________________
 
ed by
lesser and meaner people,--but honour of some kind they must have.

exactly.

once more let me ask: does he who desires any class of goods, desire the
whole class or a part only?

the whole.

and may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a part
of wisdom only, but of the whole?

yes, of the whole.

and he who dislikes learning, especially in youth, when he has no power
of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not
to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses his
food is not hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a
good one?

very true, he said.

whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is
curious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a
philosopher? am i not right?

glaucon said: if curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many a
strange being will have a title to the name. all the lovers of sights
have a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. musical
ama
 
 ___________________________
 
 the name of philosophers.

how do you distinguish them? he said.

the lovers of sounds and sights, i replied, are, as i conceive, fond of
fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that
are made out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving
absolute beauty.

true, he replied.

few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this.

very true.

and he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute
beauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is
unable to follow--of such an one i ask, is he awake or in a dream
only? reflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens
dissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?

i should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.

but take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of absolute
beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which
participate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place of the
idea no
 
 ___________________________
 
r the idea in the place of the objects--is he a dreamer, or is he
awake?

he is wide awake.

and may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge, and
that the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion?

certainly.

but suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our
statement, can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him,
without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?

we must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.

come, then, and let us think of something to say to him. shall we begin
by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have,
and that we are rejo
 
 ___________________________
 
iced at his having it? but we should like to ask him
a question: does he who has knowledge know something or nothing? (you
must answer for him.)

i answer that he knows something.

something that is or is not?

something that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?

and are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of
view, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the
utterly non-existent is utterly unknown?

nothing can be more certain.

good. but if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and
not to be, that will have a place 
 
 ___________________________
 
intermediate between pure being and
the absolute negation of being?

yes, between them.

and, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to
not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has
to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and
knowledge, if there be such?

certainly.

do we admit the existence of opinion?

undoubtedly.

as being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?

another faculty.

then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter
corresponding to this difference of faculties?

yes.

and knowledge is relative to being and knows being. but before i proceed
further i will make a division.

what division?

i will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are
powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. sight
and hearing, for example, i should call faculties. have i clearly
explained the class which i mean?

yes, i quite understand.

then let me tel
 
 ___________________________
 
ot see them, and
therefore the distinctions of figure, colour, and the like, which enable
me to discern the differences of some things, do not apply to them. in
speaking of a faculty i think only of its sphere and its result; and
that which has the same sphere and the same result i call the same
faculty, but that which has another sphere and another result i call
different. would that be your way of speaking?

yes.

and will you be so very good as to answer one more question? would you
say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?

certainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.

and is opinion also a faculty?

certainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form
an opinion.

and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not
the same as opinion?

why, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that which
is infallible with that which errs?

an excellent answer, proving, i said, that we are quite 
 
 ___________________________
 
conscious of a
distinction between them.

yes.

then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct
spheres or subject-matters?

that is certain.

being is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to
know the nature of being?

yes.

and opinion is to have an opinion?

yes.

and do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion the
same as the subject-matter of knowledge?

nay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in
faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject-matter, and if, as
we were saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the
sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.

then if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must be
the subject-matter of opinion?

yes, something else.

well then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather, how
can there be an opinion at all abo
 
 ___________________________
 
ut not-being? reflect: when a man
has an opinion, has he not an opinion about something? can he have an
opinion which is an opinion about nothing?

impossible.

he who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?

yes.

and not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?

true.

of not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of
being, knowledge?

true, he said.

then opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?

not with either.

and can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?

that seems to be true.

but is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in
a greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than
ignorance?

in neither.

then i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,
but lighter than ignorance?

both; and in no small degree.

and also to be within and b
 
 ___________________________
 
etween them?

yes.

then you would infer that opinion is intermediate?

no question.

but were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a sort
which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would appear
also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not-being;
and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance,
but will be found in the interval between them?

true.

and in that interval there has now been discovered something which we
call opinion?

there has.

then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally
of the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed
either, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may
truly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper
faculty,--the extremes to the faculties of the extremes a
 
 ___________________________
 
 greater
darkness or negation than not-being, or more full of light and existence
than being.

that is quite true, he said.

thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the
multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are
tossing about in some region which is half-way between pure being and
pure not-being?

we have.

yes; and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might
find was to be described as matter of opinion, and not as matter of
knowledge; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by
the intermediate faculty.

quite true.

then those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute
beauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see the
many just, and not absolute justice, and the like,--such persons may be
said to have opinion but not knowledge?

that is certain.

but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to
know, and not to have opinion only?

neither can t
 
 ___________________________
 
hat be denied.

the one love and embrace the subjects of knowledge, the other those of
opinion? the latter are the same, as i dare say you will remember, who
listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would not
tolerate the existence of absolute beauty.

yes, i remember.

shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of
opinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with
us for thus describing them?

i shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what is
true.

but those who love the truth in

 and variable are not
philosophers, i must ask you which of the two classes should be the
rulers of our state?

and how can we rightly answer that question?

whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of
our state--let them be our guardians.

very good.

neither, i said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to
keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?

there can be no question of that.

and are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge
of the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear
pattern, and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute
truth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the
other world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this,
if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them--are
not such persons, i ask, simply blind?

truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.

and shall they be our guardians when there are ot
 
 ___________________________
 
e can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this
greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place
unless they fail in some other respect.

suppose then, i said, that we determine how far they can unite this and
the other excellences.

by all means.

in the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the
philosopher has to be ascertained. we must come to an understanding
about him, and, when we have done so, then, if i am not mistaken, we
shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and
that those in whom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in
the state.

what do you mean?

let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort
which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and
corruption.

agreed.

and further, i said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true
being; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less
honourable, which they are willing to renounce; as we
 
 ___________________________
 
 is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?

how can there be?

can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?

never.

the true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as
in him lies, desire all truth?

assuredly.

but then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong
in one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a
stream which has been drawn off into another channel.

true.

he whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be
absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily
pleasure--i mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.

that is most certain.

such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for the
motives which make another man desirous of having and spending, have no
place in his character.

very true.

another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered.

what is that?

there should be no secret corner of illiberality;
 
 ___________________________
 
em become strange monsters, not to say utter rogues, and that those
who may be considered the best of them are made useless to the world by
the very study which you extol.

well, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?

i cannot tell, he replied; but i should like to know what is your
opinion.

hear my answer; i am of opinion that they are quite right.

then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from
evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are acknowledged
by us to be of no use to them?

you ask a question, i said, to which a reply can only be given in a
parable.

yes, socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all
accustomed, i suppose.

i perceive, i said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into
such a hopeless discussion; but now hear the parable, and then you will
be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination: for the manner
in which the best men are treated in their own states is so grievous
that
 
 ___________________________
 
 no single thing on earth is comparable to it; and therefore, if
i am to plead their cause, i must have recourse to fiction, and put
together a figure made up of many things, like the fabulous unions of
goats and stags which are found in pictures. imagine then a fleet or a
ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of
the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight,
and his knowledge of navigation is not much better. the sailors are
quarrelling with one another about the steering--every one is of opinion
that he has a right to steer, though he has never learned the art of
navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned, and will
further assert that it cannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in
pieces any one who says the contrary. they throng about the captain,
begging and praying him to commit the helm to them; and if at any time
they do not prevail, but o

 means.

and let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the description
of the gentle and noble nature. truth, as you will remember, was his
leader, whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this, he
was an impostor, and had no part or lot in true philosophy.

yes, that was said.

well, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at
variance with present notions of him?

certainly, he said.

and have we not a right to say in his defence, that the true lover of
knowledge is always striving after being--that is his nature; he will
not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance only,
but will go on--the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the force of his
desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature
of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul, and by
that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate with very
being, having begotten mind and truth, he will have knowledge and will
live and g

this is their wisdom. i might compare them to a man who
should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is
fed by him--he would learn how to approach and handle him, also at what
times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse, and what
is the meaning of his several cries, and by what sounds, when another
utters them, he is soothed or infuriated; and you may suppose further,
that when, by continually attending upon him, he has become perfect in
all this, he calls his knowledge wisdom, and makes of it a system or
art, which he proceeds to teach, although he has no real notion of what
he means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking, but
calls this honourable and that dishonourable, or good or evil, or just
or unjust, all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great
brute. good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and
evil to be that which he dislikes; and he can give no other account
of them except that the just and noble are th

a natural unity. but a human being who in word and work is perfectly
moulded, as far as he can be, into the proportion and likeness of
virtue--such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image, they
have never yet seen, neither one nor many of them--do you think that
they ever did?

no indeed.

no, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble
sentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means
in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge, while
they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the end is
opinion and strife, whether they meet with them in the courts of law or
in society.

they are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.

and this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason why truth forced
us to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities nor
states nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small
class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are

 
 ___________________________
 
s. am i not right?

quite right.

if then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour in
some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected
philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior
power to have the charge of the state, we are ready to assert to the
death, that this our constitution has been, and is--yea, and will be
whenever the muse of philosophy is queen. there is no impossibility in
all this; that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.

my opinion agrees with yours, he said.

but do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?

i should imagine not, he replied.

o my friend, i said, do not attack the multitude: they will change their
minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with the view
of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education, you show
them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just
now doing their character and profession, and then mank
 
 ___________________________
 
intellectual toil.

quite true.

and yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to
whom the higher education is to be imparted, and who are to share in any
office or command.

certainly, he said.

and will they be a class which is rarely found?

yes, indeed.

then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers
and pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind of
probation which we did not mention--he must be exercised also in many
kinds of knowledge, to see whether the soul will be able to endure the
highest of all, or will faint under them, as in any other studies and
exercises.

yes, he said, you are quite right in testing him. but what do you mean
by the highest of all knowledge?

you may remember, i said, that we divided the soul into three parts; and
distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, and
wisdom?

indeed, he said, if i had forgotten, i should not deserve to hear more.

and do you remember the word of ca

contented and think that they need search no further.

not an uncommon case when people are indolent.

yes, i said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the
state and of the laws.

true.

the guardian then, i said, must be required to take the longer circuit,
and toil at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach
the highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is his
proper calling.

what, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this--higher than
justice and the other virtues?

yes, i said, there is. and of the virtues too we must behold not the
outline merely, as at present--nothing short of the most finished
picture should satisfy us. when little things are elaborated with an
infinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty
and utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not
 
 ___________________________
 
 think the
highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!

a right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from
asking you what is this highest knowledge?

nay, i said, ask if you will; but i am certain that you have heard the
answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as i
rather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have often
been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all
other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this.
you can hardly be ignorant that of this i was about to speak, concerning
which, as you have often heard me say, we know so little; and, without
which, any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us
nothing. do you think that the possession of all other things is of
any value if we do not possess the good? or the knowledge of all other
things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?

assured
 
 ___________________________
 
ly not.

you are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good,
but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge?

yes.

and you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by
knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?

how ridiculous!

yes, i said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance
of the good, and then presume our knowledge of it--for the good they
define to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood them when
they use the term 'good'--this is of course ridiculous.

most true, he said.

and those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; for they
are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good.

certainly.

and therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?

true.

there can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this
question is involved.

there can be none.

further, do we not see that many are w

 nature nor having the same
assurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever
good there is in other things,--of a principle such and so great as this
ought the best men in our state, to whom everything is entrusted, to be
in the darkness of ignorance?

certainly not, he said.

i am sure, i said, that he who does not know how the beautiful and
the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and
i suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true
knowledge of them.

that, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.

and if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be
perfectly ordered?

of course, he replied; but i wish that you would tell me whether you
conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure,
or different from either?

aye, i said, i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would
not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters.

true, socrates; but i must say tha

intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and
perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and
is first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no
intelligence?

just so.

now, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to
the knower is what i would have you term the idea of good, and this
you will deem to be the cause of science, and of truth in so far as
the latter becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both
truth and knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature as
more beautiful than either; and, as in the previous instance, light and
sight may be truly said to be like the sun, and yet not to be the sun,
so in this other sphere, science and truth may be deemed to be like the
good, but not the good; the good has a place of honour yet higher.

what a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author of
science and truth, and yet surpasses them in 
 
 ___________________________
 
beauty; for you surely
cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good?

god forbid, i replied; but may i ask you to consider the image in
another point of view?

in what point of view?

you would say, would you not, that the sun is not only the author of
visibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and
growth, though he himself is not generation?

certainly.

in like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of
knowledge to all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet
the good is not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.

glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: by the light of heaven, how
amazing!

yes, i said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you made
me utter my fancies.

and pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there is
anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun.

yes, i said, there is a great deal more.

would you not admit that both the sections of this division have
different degrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the
sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge?

most undoubtedly.

next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the
intellectual is to be divided.

in what manner?

thus:--there are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses
the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only
be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends
to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of
hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making
no use of im

irst principle, because she is unable to rise above the region of
hypothesis, but employing the objects of which the shadows below are
resemblances in their turn as images, they having in relation to the
shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness, and therefore a
higher value.

i understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of geometry
and the sister arts.

and when i speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will
understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason
herself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as
first principles, but only as hypotheses--that is to say, as steps and
points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order
that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and
clinging to this and then to that which depends on this, by successive
steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object, from
ideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.

i understand you,
 
 ___________________________
 
 he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to
be describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate, i
understand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of
dialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as
they are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also
contemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because
they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those who
contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason
upon them, although when a first principle is added to them they are
cognizable by the higher reason. and the habit which i

no question, he said.

this entire allegory, i said, you may now append, dear glaucon, to the
previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of
the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret
the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual
world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, i have
expressed--whether rightly or wrongly god knows. but, whether true or
false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good
appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen,
is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and
right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world,
and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and
that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in
public or private life must have his eye fixed.

i agree, he said, as far as i am able to understand you.

moreover, i said, yo

kness to the day is dazzled by excess
of light. and he will count the one happy in his condition and state of
being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the
soul which comes from below into the light, there will be more reason
in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of
the light into the den.

that, he said, is a very just distinction.

but then, if i am right, certain professors of education must be wrong
when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not
there before, like sight into blind eyes.

they undoubtedly say this, he replied.

whereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning
exists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn
from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of
knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the
world of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure
the sight of being, and of the brig

nor yet those who never make an end of
their education, will be able ministers of state; not the former,
because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their
actions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will
not act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already
dwelling apart in the islands of the blest.

very true, he replied.

then, i said, the business of us who are the founders of the state
will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have
already shown to be the greatest of all--they must continue to ascend
until they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen
enough we must not allow them to do as they do now.

what do you mean?

i mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be
allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the
den, and partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth
having or not.

but is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give the
 
 ___________________________
 
the gods?

by all means, he replied.

the process, i said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell (in
allusion to a game in which two parties fled or pursued according as an
oyster-shell which was thrown into the air fell with the dark or light
side uppermost.), but the turning round of a soul passing from a day
which is little better than night to the true day of being, that is, the
ascent from below, which we affirm to be true philosophy?

quite so.

and should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of
effecting such a change?

certainly.

what sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming
to being? and another consideration has just occurred to me: you will
remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?

yes, that was said.

then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?

what quality?

usefulness in war.

yes, if possible.

there were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?

just so.

there was gymnastic w
 
 ___________________________
 
hich presided over the growth and decay of the
body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and
corruption?

true.

then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?

no.

but what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent
into our former scheme?

music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,
and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making
them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and
the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of
rhythm and harmony in them. but in music there was nothing which tended
to that
 
 ___________________________
 
 good which you are now seeking.

you are most accurate, i said, in your recollection; in music there
certainly was nothing of the kind. but what branch of knowledge is
there, my dear glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the
useful arts were reckoned mean by us?

undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts
are also excluded, what remains?

well, i said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and
then we shall have to take something which is not special, but of
universal application.

what may that be?

a something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common,
and which every one first has t

general. did you never remark how he declares
that he had invented number, and had numbered the ships and set in array
the ranks of the army at troy; which implies that they had never been
numbered before, and agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been
incapable of counting his own feet--how could he if he was ignorant of
number? and if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?

i should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.

can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?

certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of
military tactics, or indeed, i should rather say, if he is to be a man
at all.

i should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of
this study?

what is your notion?

it appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and
which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly
used; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.

will you explain you
 
 ___________________________
 
r meaning? he said.

i will try, i said; and i wish you would share the enquiry with me,
and say 'yes' or 'no' when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what
branches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may
have clearer proof that arithmetic is, as i suspect, one of them.

explain, he said.

i mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them do
not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them; while
in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further
enquiry is imperatively demanded.

you are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses
are imposed upon by distance, and by painting in
 
 ___________________________
 
way in which the study of the
one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation
of true being.

and surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see
the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?

yes, i said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all
number?

certainly.

and all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?

yes.

and they appear to lead the mind towards truth?

yes, in a very remarkable manner.

then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having a
double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn
the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the
philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and
lay hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.

that is true.

and our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?

certainly.

then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe;
and we must endeavour t

s.), taking
care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions.

that is very true.

now, suppose a person were to say to them: o my friends, what are these
wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say,
there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable,
indivisible,--what would they answer?

they would answer, as i should conceive, that they were speaking of
those numbers which can only be realized in thought.

then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary,
necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the
attainment of pure truth?

yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.

and have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for
calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and
even the dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they
may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than
they would otherwise have been.

very 
 
 ___________________________
 
true, he said.

and indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not
many as difficult.

you will not.

and, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which
the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.

i agree.

let this then be made one of our subjects of education. and next, shall
we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?

you mean geometry?

exactly so.

clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which
relates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position,
or closing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military
manoeuvre, whether in actual battle or on a mar
 
 ___________________________
 
g, it concerns us; if becoming
only, it does not concern us?

yes, that is what we assert.

yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny
that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the
ordinary language of geometricians.

how so?

they have in view practice only, and are always speaking, in a narrow
and ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the
like--they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life;
whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science.

certainly, he said.

then must not a further admission be made?

what admission?

that the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal,
and not of aught perishing and transient.

that, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.

then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth,
and create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now
unhappily allowed to fall down.

nothing will be more likely to have su
 
 ___________________________
 
ch an effect.

then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants
of your fair city should by all means learn geometry. moreover the
science has indirect effects, which are not small.

of what kind? he said.

there are the military advantages of which you spoke, i said; and in all
departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has studied
geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not.

yes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them.

then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our
youth will study?

let us do so, he replied.

and suppose we make astronomy the third--what do you say?

i am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons
and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the

se shall
be given in your own spirit. for every one, as i think, must see that
astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world
to another.

every one but myself, i said; to every one else this may be clear, but
not to me.

and what then would you say?

i should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy
appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.

what do you mean? he asked.

you, i replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our
knowledge of the things above. and i dare say that if a person were to
throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still think
that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. and you are very
likely right, and i may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that
knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul
look upwards, and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the
ground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, i would deny that he
can learn, for nothi
 
 ___________________________
 
ng of that sort is matter of science; his soul is
looking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by water
or by land, whether he floats, or only lies on his back.

i acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. still, i should like
to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive
to that knowledge of which we are speaking?

i will tell you, i said: the starry heaven which we behold is wrought
upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most
perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to
the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are
relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in
them, in the true number and in every true figure. now, these are to be
apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not b

y sight.

true, he replied.

the spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that
higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures
excellently wrought by the hand of daedalus, or some other great artist,
which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw them would
appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he would never
dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true
double, or the truth of any other proportion.

no, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.

and will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he lo
 
 ___________________________
 
eive that as the eyes are designed to
look up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and
these are sister sciences--as the pythagoreans say, and we, glaucon,
agree with them?

yes, he replied.

but this, i said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better go
and learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other
applications of these sciences. at the same time, we must not lose sight
of our own higher object.

what is that?

there is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which our
pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as i was saying
that they did in astronomy. for in the science of harmony, as you
probably know, the same thing happens. the teachers of harmony compare
the sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like
that of the astronomers, is in vain.

yes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as good as a play to hear them talking
about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears
close alon
 
 ___________________________
 
 would be tedious, and therefore i will
only say that these are not the men, and that i am referring to the
pythagoreans, of whom i was just now proposing to enquire about harmony.
for they too are in error, like the astronomers; they investigate the
numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but they never attain to
problems--that is to say, they never reach the natural harmonies of
number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not.

that, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.

a thing, i replied, which i would rather call useful; that is, if sought
after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in any other
spirit, useless.

very true, he said.

now, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and
connection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual
affinities, then, i think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them
have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them.

i suspect so; but you are speaking

, socrates, of a vast work.

what do you mean? i said; the prelude or what? do you not know that all
this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn? for
you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?

assuredly not, he said; i have hardly ever known a mathematician who was
capable of reasoning.

but do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason
will have the knowledge which we require of them?

neither can this be supposed.

and so, glaucon, i said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of
dialectic. this is that strain which is of the intellect only, but which
the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight,
as you may remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold the
real animals and stars, and last of all the sun himself. and so with
dialectic; when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by
the light of reason only, an

them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?

certainly not.

then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as
will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering
questions?

yes, he said, you and i together will make it.

dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences,
and is set over them; no other science can be placed higher--the nature
of knowledge can no further go?

i agree, he said.

but to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to
be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered.

yes, clearly.

you remember, i said, how the rulers were chosen before?

certainly, he said.

the same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given
to the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and,
having noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural
gifts which will facilitat

can run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.

of course.

and, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of
instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented
to the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our
system of education.

why not?

because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of
knowledge of any kind. bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm
to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no
hold on the mind.

very true.

then, my good friend, i said, do not use compulsion, but let early
education be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find
out the natural bent.

that is a very rational notion, he said.

do you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see the
battle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were

nd the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most
important tests to which our youth are subjected.

certainly, he replied.

after that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years
old will be promoted to higher honour, and the sciences which they
learned without any order in their early education will now be brought
together, and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them
to one another and to true being.

yes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting
root.

yes, i said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion
of dialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical.

i agree with you, he said.

these, i said, are the points which you must consider; and those who
have most of this comprehension, and who are most steadfast in their
learning, and in their military and other appointed duties, when they
have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the
select class, and el

which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get their
experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying whether,
when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they will stand
firm or flinch.

and how long is this stage of their lives to last?

fifteen years, i answered; and when they have reached fifty years of
age, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves
in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at
last to their consummation: the time has now arrived at which they must
raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all
things, and behold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according
to which they are to order the state and the lives of individuals, and
the remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief
pursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics and ruling
for the public good, not as though they were performing some heroi

there is no difficulty, he replied; and i agree with you in thinking
that nothing more need be said.

and so, glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect
state wives and children are to be in common; and that all education
and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best
philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?

that, replied glaucon, has been acknowledged.

yes, i said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when
appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses
such as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain nothing
private, or individual; and about their property, you remember what we
agreed?

yes, i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions
of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving
from the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only t

ken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an
end, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will
in time be dissolved. and this is the dissolution:--in plants that grow
in the earth, as well as in animals that move on the earth's surface,
fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences
of the circles of each are completed, which in short-lived existences
pass over a short space, and in long-lived ones over a long space. but
to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and
education of your rulers will not attain; the laws which regulate them
will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense,
but will escape them, and they will bring children into the world when
they ought not. now that which is of divine birth has a period which is
contained in a perfect number (i.e. a cyclical number, such as 6, which
is equal to the sum of its divisors 1, 2, 3, so that when the circle

but when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going
to sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble
thoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having
first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but just
enough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments and
pains from interfering with the higher principle--which he leaves in
the solitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire to
the knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future: when
again he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel against
any one--i say, when, after pacifying the two irrational principles, he
rouses up the third, which is reason, before he takes his rest, then,
as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and is least likely to be the
sport of fantastic and lawless visions.

i quite agree.

in saying this i have been running into a digression; but the point
which i desire to note is th
 
 ___________________________
 
to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were
concerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a single
notion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul
as loving gain or money.

i agree with you.

again, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering
and getting fame?

true.

suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious--would the term be
suitable?

extremely suitable.

on the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge is
wholly directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others
for gain or fame.

far less.

'lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may fitly
apply to that part of the soul?

certainly.

one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in
others, as may happen?

yes.

then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of
men--lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?

exactly.

and there are three kinds of pleasure, which are th

able,
or better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless--how
shall we know who speaks truly?

i cannot myself tell, he said.

well, but what ought to be the criterion? is any better than experience
and wisdom and reason?

there cannot be a better, he said.

then, i said, reflect. of the three individuals, which has the greatest
experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated? has the lover of
gain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of
the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of
gain?

the philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has
of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his
childhood upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not
of necessity tasted--or, i should rather say, even had he desired, could
hardly have tasted--the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.

then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain,
for he has a double experience?

 
 ___________________________
 

yes, very great.

again, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the
lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom?

nay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their
object; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have
their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have
experience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be
found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only.

his experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?

far better.

and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?

certainly.

further, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not
possessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?

what faculty?

reason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.

yes.

and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?

certainly.

and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?

true.

and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?

certainly.

and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that
which has more existence the truer?

clearly, from that which has more.

what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your
judgment--those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of
sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion
and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue? put
the question in this way:--which has a more pure being--that which is
concerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of
such a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned
with and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and
mortal?

far purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with the
invariable.

and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same

degree as of essence?

yes, of knowledge in the same degree.

and of truth in the same degree?

yes.

and, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of
essence?

necessarily.

then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of the
body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service
of the soul?

far less.

and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?

yes.

t the passionate man who carries his passion into
action, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or
violent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking
to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without
reason or sense?

yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.

then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,
when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company
of reason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which
wisdom shows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest
degree which is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; and
they will have the pleasures which are natural to them, if that which is
best for each one is also most natural to him?

yes, certainly; the best is the most natural.

is no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their

ases me better than the rule
about poetry.

to what do you refer?

to the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to be
received; as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have
been distinguished.

what do you mean?

speaking in confidence, for i should not like to have my words repeated
to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe--but i do not
mind saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the
understanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true
nature is the only antidote to them.

explain the purport of your remark.

well, i will tell you, although i have always from my earliest youth had
an awe and love of homer, which even now makes the words falter on
my lips, for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that
charming tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than the
truth, and therefore i will speak out.

very good, he said.

listen to me then, or rather, answer me.

put your question.

certainly.

and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all
the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing
with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man--whoever tells us
this, i think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who
is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and
whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyse
the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.

most true.

and so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and homer, who
is at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue as well
as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot compose
well unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this knowledge
can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also there may
not be a similar illusion. perhaps they may have come across imitators
and been deceived by them; t

hey may not have remembered when they saw
their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the
truth, and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth,
because they are appearances only and not realities? or, after all, they
may be in the right, and poets do really know the things about which
they seem to the many to speak so well?

the question, he said, should by all means be considered.

now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as
well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making
branch? would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life,
as if he had nothing higher

nothing of the kind is recorded of him. for surely, socrates,
creophylus, the companion of homer, that child of flesh, whose name
always makes us laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity,
if, as is said, homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own
day when he was alive?

yes, i replied, that is the tradition. but can you imagine, glaucon,
that if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind--if he
had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator--can you imagine,
i say, that he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and
loved by them? protagoras of abdera, and prodicus of ceos, and a host of
others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries: 'you will never be
able to manage either your own house or your own state until you appoint
us to be your ministers of education'--and this ingenious device of
theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their companions

ought to make them, and the other will attend to
his instructions?

of course.

the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and
badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is
told by him?

true.

the instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it
the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain
from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to hear what
he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?

true.

but will the imitator have either? will he know from use whether or no
his drawing is correct or beautiful? or will he have right opinion
from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him
instructions about what he should draw?

neither.

then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about
the goodness or badness of his imitations?

i suppose not.

the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about
his own creations?

nay,

very much the reverse.

and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing
good or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which
appears to be good to the ignorant multitude?

just so.

thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no
knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates. imitation is only a kind
of play or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in iambic or
in heroic verse, are imitators in the highest degree?

very true.

and now tell me, i conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us to be
concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?

certainly.

and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?

what do you mean?

i will explain: the body which is large when seen near, appears sma

bad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. is there
anything more?

no, there is nothing else.

but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with
himself--or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and
opposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there
not strife and inconsistency in his life? though i need hardly raise the
question again, for i remember that all this has been already admitted;
and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten
thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?

and we were right, he said.

yes, i said, thus far we were right; but there was an omission which
must now be supplied.

what was the omission?

were we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his
son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with
more equanimity than another?

yes.

but will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot help

n happiness and virtue.

i cannot deny it.

therefore, glaucon, i said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists
of homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas, and that he
is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things, and
that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and
regulate your whole life according to him, we may love and honour those
who say these things--they are excellent people, as far as their lights
extend; and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest
of poets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our
conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only
poetry which ought to be admitted into our state. for if you go beyond
this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or lyric verse,
not law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent have ever
been deemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state.

that is most true, he said.

ust man should appear unjust and the unjust
just: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case
could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission
ought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure
justice might be weighed against pure injustice. do you remember?

i should be much to blame if i had forgotten.

then, as the cause is decided, i demand on behalf of justice that the
estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge
to be her due should now be restored to her by us; since she has been
shown to confer reality, and not to deceive those who truly possess her,
let what has been taken from her be given back, that so she may win that
palm of appearance which is hers also, and which she gives to her own.

the demand, he said, is just.

in the first place, i said--and this is the first thing which you will
have to give back--the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known
to the gods.

character in them, because the soul, when choosing a new life, must of
necessity become different. but there was every other quality, and
the all mingled with one another, and also with elements of wealth and
poverty, and disease and health; and there were mean states also. and
here, my dear glaucon, is the supreme peril of our human state; and
therefore the utmost care should be taken. let each one of us leave
every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only, if
peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make
him able to learn and discern between good and evil, and so to choose
always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. he should
consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned
severally and collectively upon virtue; he should know what the effect
of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul,
and what are the good and evil conse
