ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for his peaceable reign
and good government.

pericles.
he is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects the name of
good government.  how far is his court distant from this shore?

first fisherman.
marry sir, half a day's journey: and i'll tell you, he hath a
fair daughter, and to-morrow is her birth-day; and there are
princes and knights come from all parts of the world to just and

did vail their crowns to his supremacy:
