o our village. but this is not to say
that we did not know what they did - what they ate and in what way they cooked it, how many otter were killed each day, and
other things as well - for someone was always watching from the cliffs while they were hunting, or from the ravine when they
were in camp.
ramo, for instance, brought news about captain orlov.
'in the morning when he crawls out of his tent he sits on a rock and combs until the beard shines like a cormorant's wing,'
ramo said.
my sister ulape, who was two years older than i, gathered the most curious news of all. she swore that there was an aleut
girl among the hunters.
'she is dressed in skins just like the men,' ulape said. ‘but she wears a fur cap and under the cap she has thick hair that falls
to her waist.'
no one believed ulape. everyone laughed at the idea that hunters would bother to bring their wives with them.
the aleuts also watched our village, otherwise they would not have known about the good fortune which befell us

soon after
they came. 
it happened in this way. early spring is a poor season for fishing. the heavy seas and winds of winter drive the fish into deep
water where they stay until the weather is settled and where they are hard to catch. during this time the village eats sparingly,
mostly from stores of seeds harvested in autumn.
word of our good fortune came on a stormy afternoon, brought by ulape, who was never idle. she had gone to a ledge on the
eastern part of the island hoping to gather shellfish. she was climbing a cliff on the way home when she heard a loud noise
behind her.
at first she did not see what had caused the noise. she thought that it was the wind echoing through one of the caves and was
about to leave when she noticed silvery shapes on the floor of the cove. the shapes moved and she saw that it was a school of
large white bass, each one as big as she was. pursued by ki

ller whales, which prey upon them when seals are not to be found,
the bass had tried to escape by swimming towards shore. but in their terror they had mistaken the depth of the water and had
been tossed on to the rocky ledge.
ulape dropped her basket of shellfish and set out for the village, arriving there so out of breath that she could only point in the
direction of the shore. the women were cooking supper but all of them stopped and gathered around her, waiting for her to
speak.
'a school of white bass,' she finally said.
'where? where?' everyone asked.
'on the rocks. a dozen of them. perhaps more than a dozen.'
before ulape had finished speaking, we were running towards the shore, hoping that we would get there in tim

long time, it was always carried to the village and worked on where a chance wave could not wash it away. that the men
were sent to hollow out the log in the cove, and to sleep beside it during the night, meant that they were there to watch the
aleuts, to give the alarm should captain orlov try to sail off without paying us for the otter skins.
everyone was afraid he might, so besides the men in the cove who watched the aleut ship, others kept watch on the camp.
every hour someone brought news. ulape said that the aleut woman spent a whole afternoon cleaning her skin aprons, which
she had not done before while she had been there. early one morning, ramo said he had just seen captain orlov carefully
trimming his beard so that it looked the way it did when he first came. the aleuts who sharpened the long spears stopped this
work and gave all their time to skinning the otter which were brought in at dusk.
we in the village of ghalas-at knew that captain orlov and his hunters were getting ready

er. before night a storm would certainly strike.
not long after dawn the aleuts took down their skin tents and carried them to the beach.
captain orlov had not paid my father for the otter he had killed. so when the news came that the hunters had packed their
tents, all of our tribe left the village and hurried towards coral cove. the men with their weapons went first and the women
followed. the men took the trail that led to the beach, but the women hid themselves among the brush on the cliff.
ulape and i went together far out on the ledge where i had hidden before when the hunters first came. 
the tide was low and the rocks and the narrow beach were scattered with bundles of otter pelts. half of the hunters were on
the ship. the rest were wading into the water, tossing the pelts into a boat. the aleuts laughed while they worked, as if they
were happy to leave the island.
my father was talking to captain orlov. i could not hear their words because of the noise the hunters made, but from th

e way
my father shook his head, i knew that he was not pleased.
'he is angry,' ulape whispered.
'not yet,' i said. ‘when he's really angry, he pulls his ear.
the men who were working on the canoe had stopped and were watching my father and captain orlov. the other men of our
tribe stood at the foot of the trail.
the boat went off to the ship filled with otter. as it reached the ship, captain orlov raised his hand and gave a signal. when
the boat came back it held a black chest which two of the hunters carried to the beach.
captain orlov raised the lid and pulled out several n

ecklaces. there was little light in the sky, yet the beads sparkled as he
named them this way and that. beside me, ulape drew in her breath in excitement, and i could hear cries of delight from the
women hidden in the brush.
but the cries suddenly ceased as my father shook his head and turned his back on the chest. the aleuts stood silent. our men
left their places at the foot of the trail and moved forward a few steps and waited, watching my father.
'one string of beads for one otter pelt is not our bargain,' my father said.
'one string and one iron spearhead,' said captain orlov, lifting two fingers.
'the chest

hat much,' my father answered.
'there are more chests on the ship,' said the russian.
'then bring them to the shore,' my father said. 'you have one hundred and five bales of otter on the ship. there are fifteen
here in the cove. you will need three more chests of this size.' 
captain orlov said something to his aleuts that i could not understand, but its meaning was soon clear. there were many
hunters in the cove and as soon as he spoke they began to carry the otter pelts to the boat.
beside me ulape was scarcely breathing. ‘do you think that he will give us the other chests!' she whispered.
‘i do not trust him.'
'when he gets the pelts to the ship he may leave.'
'it is possible.'
the hunters had to pass my father to reach the boat, and when the first one approached him, he stepped in his path.
'the rest of the pelts must stay here,' he said, facing captain orlov, 'until the chests are brought.'
the russian drew himself up stiffly and pointed to the clouds that were blowing in towards t

d the cove. he looked at our men standing on the ledge of rock a
dozen paces away. he looked upward towards the cliff and back at my father. then he spoke to his aleuts.
i do not know what happened first, whether it was my father who raised his hand against the hunter whose path he barred,
whether it was this man who stepped forward with a bale of pelts on his back and shoved my father aside. it all happened so
quickly that i could not tell one act from the other. but as i jumped to my feet and ulape screamed and other cries sounded
along the cliff, i saw a figure lying on the rocks. it was my father and blood was on his face. slowly he got to his feet.
with their spears raised our men rushed down across the ledge. a puff of white smoke came from the deck of the ship. a
loud noise echoed against the cliff. five of our warriors fell and lay quiet.
ulape screamed again and hung a rock into the cove. it fell harmlessly beside captain orlov. rocks showered into the cove
from many places along t

he cliff, striking several of the hunters. then our warriors rushed in upon them and it was hard to tell 
one from the other.
ulape and i: stood on the cliff, and watched helplessly, afraid to use the rocks we held lest we injure our own men.
the aleuts had dropped the bales of otter. they drew knives from their belts and as our warriors rushed upon them the two
lines surged back and forth along the beach. men fell to the sand and rose to fight again. others fell and did not get up. my
father was one of these.
for a long time it seemed that we would win the battle. but captain orlov, who had rowed off to the ship when the b

ted, returned with more of his aleuts.
our warriors were forced backward to the cliffs. there were few of them left, yet they fought at the foot of the trail and
would not retreat.
the wind began to blow. suddenly captain orlov and his aleuts turned and ran to the boat. our men did not pursue them.
the hunters reached the ship, the red sails went up, and that ship moved slowly between the two rocks that guard the cove.
once more before it disappeared a white puff of smoke rose from the deck. as ulape and i ran along the cliffs a whirring
sound like a great bird in flight passed above our heads.

that night was the most terrible time in all the memory of ghalas-at. when the fateful day had dawned the tribe numbered
forty-two men, counting those who were too old to fight. when night came and the women had carried back to the village
those who had died on the beach of coral cove, there remained only fifteen. of these, seven were old men.
there was no woman who had not lost a father or a husba

ryone together, saying:
'most of those who snared fowl and found fish in the deep water and built canoes are gone. the women, who were never
asked to do more than stay at home, cook food, and make clothing, now must take the place of the men and face the dangers
which abound beyond the village. there will be grumbling in ghalas-at because of this. there will be shirkers. these will be
punished, for without the help of all, all must perish.'
kimki portioned work for each one in the tribe, giving ulape and me the task of gathering abalones. this shellfish grew on
the rocks along the shore and was plentiful. we gathered them at low tide in baskets and carried them to the mesa where we
cut the dark red flesh from the shell and placed it on flat rocks to dry in the sun.
ramo had the task of keeping the abalones safe from the gulls and especially the wild dogs. dozens of our animals, which
had left the village when their owners had died, joined the wild pack that roamed the island. they soon grew

 as fierce as the
wild ones and only came back to the village to steal food. each day towards evening ulape and i helped ramo put the
abalones in baskets and carry them to the village for safekeeping.
during this time other women were gathering the scarlet apples that grow on the cactus bushes and are called tunas. fish
were caught and many birds were netted. so hard did the women work that we really fared better than before when the
hunting was done by the men.
life in the village should have been peaceful, but it was not. the men said that the women had taken the tasks that rightfully
were theirs a

there
was already ample food to last through the winter, it no longer mattered who hunted
but this was not the real reason why autumn and winter were unpeaceful in ghalas-at. those who had died at coral cove
were still with us. every- where we went on the island or on the sea, whether we were fishing or eating or sitting by the fires
at night, they were with us. we all remembered some- one and i remembered my father, so tad and strong and kind. a few 
years ago my mother had died and since then ulape and i had tried to do the tasks she had done, ulape even more than i,
being older. now that my father was gone, it was not easy to look after ramo, who was always into some mischief.
it was the same in the other houses of ghalas-at, but more than the burdens which had fallen upon us all, it was the memory
of those who had gone that burdened our hearts.
after food had been stored in autumn and the baskets were full in every house, there was more time to drink about them, so

he threw out his chest and took a deep breath. he looked around at the circle of faces as if he 
did not understand why everyone was staring at him.
'the ship,' he said at last, saying the words slowly, ‘does not belong to our enemies, the aleuts. there are white men on this
ship and they have come from that place where kimki went when he left our island.'
'has kimki returned?' an old man broke in.
'no, but it is he who saw the white men and told them to come here.'
'what do they look like !' ulape asked.
'are there boys on the ship?' asked ramo, who had come back with his mouth full of something.
everyone seemed to be talking at once.
nanko made his face stern, which was hard for him to do because his mouth had been cut in the battle with the aleuts and
ever since it had always seemed to smile. he held up his hand for silence. 'the ship has come for one reason,' he said. 'to
take us away from ghalas-at.'
'to what place?’ i asked.
it was good news that the ship did not belong to the ale

we took nothing with us when we thought we would have to see, so there was much excitement as we packed our baskets.
nanko strode up and down outside the houses, urging us to hurry.
'the wind grows strong,' he shouted. ‘the ship will leave you.'
i filled two baskets with the things i wished to take. three fine needles of whalebone, an awl for making holes, a good stone
knife for scraping hides, two cooking pots, and a small box made from a shell with many ear-rings in it.
ulape had two boxes of ear-rings, for she was vainer than i, and when she put them into her baskets, she drew a thin mark
with blue clay across her nose and cheekbones. the mark meant that she was unmarried.
'the ship leaves,' shouted nanko.
'if it goes,' ulape shouted back, ‘it will come again after the storm.'
my sister was in love with nanko; but she laughed at him.
'other men will come to the island,' she said. 'they will be far more handsome and brave than those who leave.'
'you are all women

ope that held the anchor.
i called to my brother, knowing that he was very curious and therefore would be in the way of the men who were working.
the wind drowned my voice and he did not answer. the deck was so crowded that it was hard to move, but i went from one
end of it to the other, calling his name. still there was no answer. no one had seen him.
at last i found nanko.
i was overcome with fear. ‘where is my brother?' i cried.
he repeated what he had told me on the beach, but as he spoke ulape who stood beside him pointed towards the island. i
looked out across the deck and the sea. there, running along the cliff, the fishing spear held over his head, was ramo.
the sails had filled and the ship was now moving slowly away. everyone was looking towards the cliff, even the white men. i
ran to one of them and pointed, but he shook his head and turned from me. the ship began to move faster. against my will, i
screamed.
chief matasaip grasped my arm.
'we cannot wait for ramo,' he said. 'if

 that weapons might have been stored there with the food and water.
i found nothing in the canoes under the cliff. then, remembering the chest the aleuts had brought to shore, i set out far coral
cove. i had seen that chest on the beach during the battle but did not remember that the hunters had taken it with them when
they fled.
the beach was empty except for rows of seaweed washed in by the storm. the tide was out and i looked in the place where
the chest had lain.
it was just below the ledge ulape and i had stood on while we watched the battle. the sand was smooth and i dug many small
holes with a stick. i dug in a wide circle, thinking that the storm might have covered it with sand.
near the centre of the circle the stick hit something hard, which i was sure was a rock, but as i dug deeper with my hands i
saw it was the black lid of the chest.
all morning i worked, moving the sand away. the chest lay deep from the washing of the waves and i did not try to dig it
out, but only so i could

llfish and perch which i cooked on a flat rock. afterwards i made two
utensils. along the shore there were stones that the sea had worn smooth. most of them were round, but i found two with
hollow places in the centre which i deepened and broadened by rubbing them with sand. using these to cook in, i saved the
juices of the fish which are good and were wasted before.
for cooking seeds and roots i wove a tight basket of fine reeds, which was easy because i had learned how to do it from my
sister ulape. after the basket had dried in the sun, i gathered lumps of pitch on the shore, softened them over the fire, and
rubbed them on the inside of the basket so that it would hold water. by heating small stones and dropping them into a mixture
of water and seeds in the basket i could make gruel.
i made a place for fire in the floor of my house, bellowing it out and lining it with rocks. in the village of ghalas-at we made
new fires every night, but now i made one fire which i covered with ashes when

which was white with a yellow beak, was not badly hurt, but he had a broken leg. i took him back to the house and
bound the bones together with two small sticks and sinew. for a while he did not try to walk. then, because he was not old
enough to fly, he began to hobble around the yard.
with the young birds and the old ones, the white gull and rontu, who was always trotting at my heels, the yard seemed a
happy place. if only i had not remembered tutok. if only i had not wondered about my sister ulape, where she was, and if 
the marks she had drawn upon her cheeks had proved magical. if they had, she was now married to kimki and was the
mother of many children. she would have smiled to see all of mine, which were so different from the ones i always wished to
have.
early that spring i started to gather abalones and i gathered many, taking them to the headland to dry. i wanted to have a good
supply ready if the aleuts came again.
one day when i was on the reef filling my canoe, i saw a herd of
 
 ___________________________
 
 friends with won- a-nee and her young, i never killed another otter. i had an otter cape for my
shoulders, which i used until it wore out, but never again did i make a new one. nor did i ever kill another cormorant for its
beautiful feathers, though they have long, thin necks and make ugly sounds when they talk to each other. nor did i kill seals
for their sinews, using instead kelp to bind the things that needed it. nor did i kill another wild dog, nor did i try to spear
another sea elephant.
ulape would have laughed at me, and others would have laughed, too - my father most of all. yet this is the way i felt about
the animals who had become my friends and those who were not, but in time could be. if ulape and my father had come back
and laughed, and all the others had come back and laughed, still i would have felt the same way, for animals and birds are
like people, too, though they do not talk the same or do the same things. without them the earth would be an unhappy place.

elf. at last, because he looked so much like his father, i called him rontu-aru, which means son of rontu.
in a short time he made friends with me. he was not so large as rontu, but he had his father's thick coat and the same yellow
eyes. often when i watched him chasing gulls on the sandpits or on the reef barking at the otter, i forgot that he was not
rontu.
we had many happy times that summer, fishing and going to tall rock in our canoe, but more and more now i thought of
tutok and my sister ulape. sometimes i would hear their voices in the wind and often, when i was on the sea, in the waves
that lapped softly against the canoe.

after the fierce storms of winter came many days when the wind did not blow. the air was so heavy that it was hard to
breathe and the sun so hot that the sea was like a sun itself, too bright to look at.
the last day of this weather i took the canoe from the cave and paddled around the reef to the sandpits. i did not take rontuaru
with me, for while he liked t

the ship had sailed away. every day
during those two springs and two summers i had gone to the headland and watched, always at dawn and again at dusk.
in the morning i smelled smoke from their fire. i went down to the ravine and bathed in the spring and put on my otter cape
and my cormorant skirt. i put on the necklace of black stones and the black ear-rings. with blue clay i made the mark of our
tribe across my nose.
then i did something that made me smile at myself. i did what my older sister ulape had done when she left the island of the
blue dolphins. below the mark of our tribe i carefully made the sign which meant that i was still unmarried. i was no longer
a girl, yet i made it anyway, using the blue clay and some white clay for the dots.
i went back to the house then and built a fire and cooked food for rontu-aru and me. i was not hungry and he ate my food 
and his too.
'we are going away,' i said to him, 'away from our island.'
but he only put his head to one side, as his father of
