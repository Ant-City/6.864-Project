[CHARACTER] 
 - 
                [CHARACTER], although a foppish city gentleman, possesses the laudable traits of 
loyalty and compassion--although not always in affairs of love. it takes a 
little time for tom to convince [CHARACTER] not to abandon nancy, since 
[CHARACTER] is caught up in his image in london. to his credit, [CHARACTER] 
transforms and follows tom's principles of honour--that is, fulfilling 
verbal commitments.
