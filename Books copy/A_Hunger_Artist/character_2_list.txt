The Overseer - 
                A circus manager who discovers the hunger artist dying in his cage. The overseer hears the hunger artist's final words, but he clearly does not care whether he lives or dies. As soon as the hunger artist expires, the overseer callously orders that his body be taken away and replaces him with a panther.
