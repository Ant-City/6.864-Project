of such choreography. the rogue gaze could see the buried line under the surface, how a knot might weave when out of sight. 
he turned away from mystery books with irritation, able to pinpoint villains  with too much ease. he was most comfortable 
with men who had the abstract madness of autodidacts, like his mentor, lord suffolk, like the english patient. 

he did not yet have a faith in books. in recent days, hana had watched him sitting beside the english patient, and it seemed 
to her a reversal of kim. the young student was now indian, the wise old teacher was english. but it was hana in the night 
who stayed with the old man, who guided him over the mountains to the sacred river. they had even read that book together, 
hana‚Äôs voice slow when wind flattened the candle flame beside her, the page dark for a moment.

kirpal singh stood where the horse‚Äôs saddle would have lain across its back. at first he simply stood on the back of the 
horse, paused and waved to those he could not see but who he knew would be watching. lord suffolk watched him through 
binoculars, saw the young man wave, both arms up and swaying. 

then he descended, down into the giant white chalk horse of westbury, into the whiteness of the horse, carved into the hill. 
now he was a black figure, the background radicalizing the darkness of his skin and his khaki uniform. if the focus on the 
binoculars was exact, lord suffolk would see the thin line of crimson lanyard on singh‚Äôs shoulder that signalled his sapper 
unit. to them it would look like he w

orse on the downs had been blown up. when engineers arrived at the site they discovered that another bomb had landed in 
the middle of the historic location‚Äî in the stomach of the giant white horse of westbury carved into the rolling chalk hills in 
1778. shortly after this event, all the chalk horses on the downs‚Äîthere were seven‚Äîhad camouflage nets pegged down over 
them, not to protect them so much as stop them being obvious landmarks for bombing raids over england. 

from the backseat lord suffolk chatted about the migration of robins from the war zones of europe, the history of bomb 
disposal,  devon  cream.  he  was  introducing  the  customs  of  england  to  the  young  sikh  as  if  it  was  a  recently  discovered 
culture. in spite of being lord suffolk he lived in devon, and until war broke out his passion was the study of lorna doone 
and  how  authentic  the  novel  was  historically  and  geographically.  most  winters  he  spent  puttering  around  the  villages  of

location for bomb-disposal training. there 
were twelve men under his command‚Äîmade up of talents from various units, sappers and engineers, and singh was one of 
them.  they  were  based  for  most  of  the  week  at  richmond  park  in  london,  being  briefed  on  new  methods  or  working  on 
unexploded  bombs  while  fallow  deer  drifted  around  them.  but  on  weekends  they  would  go  down  to  ex-moor,  where  they 
would continue training during the day and afterwards be driven by lord suffolk to the church where lorna doone was shot 
during her wedding ceremony. ‚Äúeither from this window or from that back door... shot right down the aisle‚Äîinto her shoulder. 
splendid shot, actually, though of course reprehensible. the villain  was chased onto the  moors and  had his  muscles  ripped 
from his body.‚Äù to singh it sounded like a familiar indian fable.

singh were thinking of stepping into the tudor corner store in his uniform and turban to chat casually with the owners about 
canes.  lord  suffolk  was  the  best  of  the  english,  he  later  told  hana.  if  there  had  been  no  war  he  would  never  have  roused

the drive to the chalk horse at westbury was therefore busy with anecdote and information. even in wartime he knew the 
best  place  to  stop  for  tea.  he  swept  into  pamela‚Äôs  tea  room,  his  arm  in  a  sling  from  an  accident  with  guncotton,  and 
shepherded in his clan‚Äîsecretary, chauffeur and sapper ‚Äîas if they were his children. how lord suffolk had persuaded the 
ljxb committee to allow him to set up his experimental bomb disposal outfit no one was sure, but with his background in 
inventions  he  probably  had  more  qualifications  than  most.  he  was  an  autodidact,  and  he  believed  his  mind  could  read  the 
motives and spirit behind any invention. he had immediately invented the pocket shirt, which allowed fuzes and gadgets to be 
stored easily by a working sapper. 

they drank tea and waited for scones, discussing the in

lord suffolk was alluding to an incident that had made him famous. he had discovered a method for inhibiting a delayed-
action fuze by pulling out his army revolver and firing a bullet through the fuze head, so arresting the movement of the clock 
body. the method was abandoned when the germans introduced a new fuze in which the percussion cap and not the clock was 
uppermost. 

 
kirpal singh had been befriended, and he would never forget it. so far, half of his time during the war had taken place in the

slipstream of this lord who had never stepped out of england and planned never to step out of countisbury once the war ended. 
singh had arrived in england knowing no one, distanced from his family in the punjab. he was twenty-one years old. he had 
met no one but soldiers. so that when he read the notice asking for volunteers with an experimental bomb squad, even though 
he heard other sappers speak of lord suffolk as a madman, he had already decided that in a war you have to take control, and 
there was a greater chance of choice and life alongside a personality or an individual. 

he was the only indian among the applicants, and lord suffolk was late. fifteen of them were led into a library and asked by 
the secretary to wait. she remained at the desk, copying out names, while the soldiers joked about the interview and the test. 
he knew no one. he walked over to a wall and stared at a barometer, was ab

nose close to a volume called raymond, or life and death by sir oliver hodge. 

he found another, similar title. pierre, or the ambiguities. he turned and caught the woman‚Äôs eyes on him again. he felt as 
guilty as if he had put the book in his pocket. she had probably never seen a turban before. the english! they expect you to 
fight for them but won‚Äôt talk to you. singh. and the ambiguities. 

 
they met a very hearty lord suffolk during lunch, who poured wine for anyone who wanted it, and laughed loudly at every 
attempt at a joke by the recruits. in the afternoon they were all given a strange exam in which a piece of machinery had to be 
put back together without any prior information of what it was used for. they were allowed two hours but could leave as soon 
as the problem was solved. singh finished the exam quickly and spent the rest of the time inventing other objects that could be 
made from the various component

he was one of three applicants selected by lord suffolk. this man who had not even spoken to him (and had not laughed 
with him, simply because he had not joked) walked across the room and put his arm around his shoulder. the severe secretary 
turned out to be miss morden, and she bustled in with a tray that held two large glasses of sherry, handed one to lord suffolk 
and, saying, ‚Äúi know you don‚Äôt drink,‚Äù took the other one for herself and raised her glass to him. ‚Äúcongratulations, your exam

‚Äúmiss morden is a splendid judge of character. she has a nose for brilliance and character.‚Äù

‚Äúyes. it is not really necessary, of course, but we are going to be working together. we are very much a family here. even 

before lunch miss morden had selected you.‚Äù 

‚Äúi found it quite a strain being unable to wink at you, mr. singh.‚Äù 
lord suffolk had his arm around singh again and was walking him to the window. 
‚Äúi thought, as we do not have to begin till the middle of next week, i‚Äôd have some of the unit come down to home farm. we 

can pool our knowledge in devon and get to know each other. you can drive down with us in the humber.‚Äù

it was almost dark when they crossed the border from somerset into devon on the coastal road overlooking the bristol 

channel. mr. harts turned down the narrow path bordered with heather and rhododendrons, a dark blood colour in this last 
light. the driveway was three miles long. 

apart from the trinity of suffolk, morden and harts, there were six sappers who made up the unit. they walked the moors 
around the stone cottage over the weekend. miss morden and lord suffolk and his wife were joined by the aviatrix for the 
saturday-night  dinner.  miss  swift  told  singh  she  had  always  wished  to  fly  overland  to  india.  removed  from  his  barracks, 
singh had no idea of his location. there was a map on a roller high up on the ceiling. alone one morning he pulled the roller 
down until it touched the floor. countisbury and area. mapped by r. fones. drawn by desire of mr. james halliday. 

‚Äúdrawn by desire ...‚Äù he was beginning to love the english.

may  1941.  singh  had  been  with  suffolk‚Äôs  unit  for  a  year.  he  was  working  in  london  that  day  with  lieutenant  blackler, 
clearing the elephant and castle area of a satan bomb. they had worked together at defusing the 4,ooo-pound bomb and were 
exhausted. he remembered halfway through he looked up and saw a couple of bomb disposal officers pointing in his direction 
and  wondered  what  that  was  about.  it  probably  meant  they  had  found  another  bomb.  it

e drove to erith. he had guessed what the officer was hesitating about asking him. he knew the man would not have come 
there just to tell him of the deaths. they were in a war, after all. it meant there was a second bomb somewhere in the vicinity, 
probably the same design, and this was the only chance to find out what had gone wrong. 

he wanted to do this alone. lieutenant blackler would stay in london. they were the last two left of the unit, and it would 
have been foolish to risk both. if lord suffolk had failed, it meant there was something new. he wanted to do this alone, in any 
case. when two men worked together there had to be a base of logic. you had to share and compromise decisions. 

he kept everything back from the surface of his emotions during the night drive. to keep his mind clear, they still had to be 
alive. miss morden drinking one large and stiff whisky before she got to the sherry. in this way she would be able to drink 
more slowly, appear more ladylike for the rest of th

one full whisky and then you can sip away like a good courtier.‚Äù this was followed by her lazy, gravelly laugh. she was the 
only woman he was to meet in his life who carried two silver flasks with her. so she was still drinking, and lord suffolk was 
still nibbling at his kipling cakes. 

the other bomb had fallen half a mile away. another sc-25okg. it looked like the familiar kind. they had defused hundreds 
of them, most by rote. this was the way the war progressed. every six months or so the enemy altered something. you learned 
the trick, the whim, the little descant, and taught it to the rest of the units. they were at a new stage now. 

he took no one with him. he would just have to remember each step. the sergeant who drove him

placed them each a foot apart along the makeshift bench. he was cold now, and 
he breathed out a feather of his warmer body air. he looked up. in the distance some soldiers were still emptying out the main 
explosive.  quickly  he  wrote  down  a  few  notes  and  handed  the  solution  for  the  new  bomb  to  an  officer.  he  didn‚Äôt  fully 
understand it, of course, but they would have this information. 

when sunlight enters a room where there is a fire, the fire will go out. he had loved lord suffolk and his strange bits of 
information. but his absence here, in the sense that everything now depended on singh, meant singh‚Äôs awareness swelled to all 
bombs of this variety across the city of london. he had suddenly a map of responsibility, something, he realized, that lord 
suffolk carried within his character at all times. it was this awareness that later created the need in him to block so much out 
when he was working on a bomb. he was one of those never interested in the choreography of

 power. he felt uncomfortable in 
the ferrying back and forth of plans and solutions. he felt capable only of reconnaissance, of locating a solution. when the 
reality of the death of lord suffolk came to him, he concluded the work he was assigned to and reenlisted into the anonymous 
machine  of  the  army.  he  was  on  the  troopship  macdonald,  which  carried  a  hundred  other  sappers  towards  the  italian 
campaign. here they were used not just for bombs but for building bridges, clearing debris, setting up tracks for armoured rail 
vehicles. he hid there for the rest of the war. few remembered the sikh who had been with suffolk‚Äôs unit. in a year the whole 
unit was disbanded

and forgotten, lieutenant blackler being the only one to rise in the ranks with his talent. 

but that night as singh drove past lewisham and black-heath towards erith, he knew  he contained,  more than any other 

sapper, the knowledge of lord suffolk. he was expected to be the replacing vision. 

he was still standing at the truck when he heard the whistle that meant they were turning off the arc lights. within thirty 
seconds metallic light had been replaced with sulphur flares in the back of the truck. another bomb raid. these lesser lights 
could be doused when they heard the planes. he sat down on the empty petrol can facing the three components he had removed

of character against all that, trusting only those who befriended him. but that night in erith he knew he was capable of having 
wires attached to him that influenced all around him who did not have his specific talent. 

a few months later he had escaped to italy, had packed the shadow of his teacher into a knapsack, the way he had seen the 
green-clothed boy at the hippodrome do it on his first leave during christmas. lord suffolk and miss morden had offered to 
take him to an english play.  he had selected  peter  pan, and they,  wordless, acquiesced and  went  with  him to a screaming 
child-full show. there were such shadows of memory with him when he lay in his tent with hana in the small hill town in 
italy. 

revealing his past or qualities of his character would have been too loud a gesture. just as he could never turn and inquire of 
her  what deepest  motive caused this relationship. he held her  with the same

to defuse it. every arrow drawn exactly, the text written out clear the way he had been taught. 

what he had discovered the night before held true. he had survived only through luck. there was no possible way to defuse 
such a bomb in situ without just blowing it up. he drew and wrote out everything he knew on the large blueprint sheet. at the 
bottom he wrote: drawn by desire of lord suffolk, by his student lieutenant kirpal singh, 10 may 1941.

bomb as it came in.

morden sits twenty yards above him, higher up the slope, taking notes on what he is doing. he knows that down and across the 
valley lord suffolk is watching through the glasses. 

he works slowly. the chalk dust lifts, then settles on everything, his hands, the contraption, so he has to blow it off the fuze 
caps and wires continually to see the details. it is hot in the tunic. he keeps putting his sweating wrists behind himself to wipe 
them on the back of his shirt. all the loose and removed parts fill the various pockets across his chest. he is tired, checking

she seems to be in no hurry to go back up the slope, back to safety. and it would seem rude to remind her that she should 
return. she simply talks about the wretched heat and the fact that at least they have booked rooms in town with baths attached, 
which they can all look forward to. she begins a rambling story about how she met lord suffolk. not a word about the bomb 
beside them. he had been slowing down, the way one, half asleep, continually rereads the same paragraph, trying to find a 
connection between sentences. she has pulled him out of the vortex of the problem. she packs up her satchel carefully, lays a 
hand  on  his  right  shoulder  and  returns  to  her  position  on  the  blanket  above  the  westbury  horse.  she  leaves  him  some 
sunglasses, but he cannot see clearly enough through them so he lays them aside. the
