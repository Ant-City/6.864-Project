through and when he left in the morning and faced
the first glare of sunlight outside the bakery he was a very weak looking man. all the next
day he worked for the studio and the next night when he came to work he was almost
tottering. he said please please think of some way i can quit this job because a man's
health will last only for so long and mine is breaking rapidly since i had no sleep at all
today and a man must have sleep if he is going to handle even one job in an honest
fashion.
then pinky carson happened to think of something. jose said pinky carson i'll tell
you what you do. about two in the morning when the pie run comes down you just pick
up six or eight pies in their boxes and walk over in front of where that little window is out
of jody's office so he can see you and you drop those damned pies. then jody'll fire you
and everything will be all right. jose thought for a little while. i do not like the use of
violence he said finally but i am a desperate man and if you think violence

ck jose took six pies and stationed himself in
the direct line of jody's vision outside the window of jody's lean-to office. all the guys
were close around looking as if they were working but really watching jose. they were
watching for the minute when jody simmons would look out through that window from
his desk. when he looked pinky was to give a signal and then jose would dump the pies.
it seemed that it took jody longer to look out that window than it ever had before. but
finally he did and pinky carson gave the signal and jose dropped the pies.
jody came zipping out of his office like a bumblebee. he said what the hell is the
matter with you you clumsy bastard you turned all these pies over. they're ruined and
you'll have to pay for them. poor jose stood there almost melting with sadness. he turned
his big eyes on jody simmons and he said i am so sorry mister simmons that i have
violated pies. it was an accident i assure you and only a poor workman would have done
it and i am miserable about

 his
face and he said why sure jose we all make mistakes. you can pay for the pies. he said
jose you are a good conscientious workman and i don't mind if you make a mistake once
in a while. he said jose i wish i had more men like you now forget about the whole thing
and go back to work.
jose stood there kind of quivering all over and shaking his head as if he couldn't
believe such bad luck could happen to him. then he turned and looked at the guys in the
crew who had been watching. he looked at pinky carson like a dog that has been
betrayed by its master. then he turned and walked over in the first aisle and began to go
to work again.
pinky carson worked over toward him as soon as possible. look here jose he said
the idea was all right only it wasn't big enough. to quit a fine job like this you want to do
something very big. the pie run is all finished for tonight but don't give up hope jose
because we have a pie run every night and tomorrow you can get one of those big racks
of pies. you can get

one of those racks that has a hundred and eighty pies just think of it
and you can put that rack in the same place and then you can push the rack over and it
will make a hell of a mess. oh boy oh boy what a mess and then jody simmons will fire
you sure.
jose looked at pinky carson and said the whole thing is very dishonorable but my
constitution will not stand very much more so i will do it tomorrow night when the pie
run comes. then he staggered back to his work.
most of the guys couldn't sleep next day they were so anxious to see jose dump over
that rack. they all came to work early. jody simmons didn't get in until around ten
o'clock usually. but everybody was hoping he would be in early so they would have a
longer time to look at the face of a man who was going to se

at the
flowers and said well i see you got some flowers jody. jody just glared at the flowers and
said that somebody was pulling something funny. but he didn't care because the roses
were good and he could take them to his wife. he sent rudy out to get a can of water to
put the roses in so they'd stay fresh. all that night whenever the guys looked toward the
little window in jody's office they saw jody's bald little head looking as if it wore a
wreath of roses.
at two o'clock the pie run began. pinky carson went upstairs to the bakeshop while
they were being boxed to check up on them. that night they had apple and vanilla cream
and blueberry and peach. pinky carson hefted each kind and tested its crust and the
thickness of the filling. the crew was well up on its work that night so they could catch
the pie run while it was still hot. pinky carson decided that the blueberry pies would run
the best if they were dumped. so he very carefully picked a rack of the hottest and
brought them down on the fr

ng but making motions.
very carefully pinky worked the pie rack over to the spot in front of jody simmons'
window. then he ducked to one side and began making signals to jose. jose came up
looking like a whipped dog. he went to the pie rack and put his hand up against the back
of it. it wouldn't take much of a push to knock it over. jose stood there just leaning
against it and looking sad. everybody was waiting for jody simmons to look out of the
window. it seemed like hours. finally he did and pinky carson gave the signal. jose just
pushed a little harder with his hand and the rack went down with a hell of a crash. one
hundred and eighty hot blueberry pies spread all over the shipping room floor.
for a minute jody just sat in his chair and stared. he looked like he couldn't believe a
thing like this could ever happen to him. then it looked like someone gave him an
electrical shock because instead of pushing his chair back before getting up he shot
straight up like a man on a stove and came runnin
