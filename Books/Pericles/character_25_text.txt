[enter gower.]

[before the palace of antioch.]

to sing a song that old was sung,
from ashes ancient gower is come;
assuming man's infirmities,
to glad your ear, and please your eyes.
it hath been sung at festivals,
on ember-eves and holy-ales;
and lords and ladies in their lives
have read it for restoratives:
the purchase is to make men glorious;
et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
if you, born in these latter times,
when wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes,
and that to hear an old man sing
may to your wishes pleasure bring,
i life would wish, and that i might
waste it for you, like taper-light.
this antioch, then, antiochus the great
built up, this city, for his chiefest seat;
the fairest in all syria,
i tell you what mine authors s

let none disturb us. -- why should this change of thoughts,
the sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
be my so used a guest as not an hour,
in the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,
the tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
and danger, which i fear'd, is at antioch,
whose arm seems far too short to hit me here:
yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
nor yet the other's distance comfort me.

and with the ostent of war will look so huge,
amazement shall drive courage from the state;
our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
and subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:

who am no more but as the tops of trees,

they do abuse the king that flatter him:
for flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
the thing the which is flatter'd, but a spark,
to which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing:
whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.

thaliard.
so, this is tyre, and this the court. here must i kill king
pericles; and if i do it not, i am sure to be hanged at home:
'tis dangerous.  well, i perceive he was a wise fellow, and
had good discretion, that, being bid to ask what he would of
the king, desired he might know none of his secrets: now do i
see he had some reason for 't; for if a king bid a man be a
villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to be one.
hush! here come the lords of tyre.

[enter helicanus and escanes, with other lords of tyre.]

helicanus.
you shall not need, my fellow peers of tyre,
further to question me of your king's departure:
his seal'd commission, left in trust with me,
doth speak sufficiently he 's gone to travel.

thaliard. [aside.]
how! the king gone!

helicanus.
if further yet you will be satisfied,
why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,
he would depart, i 'ii give some light unto you.

royal antiochus -- on what cause i know not
took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:
and doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
to show his sorrow, he 'ld correct himself;
so puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
with whom each minute threatens life or death.

thaliard. [aside.]
well, i perceive
i shall not be hang'd now, although i would;
but since he 's gone, the king's seas must please
he  'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.
i 'll present myself.  peace to the lords of tyre!

helicanus.
lord thaliard from antiochus is welcome.

thaliard.
from him i come
with message unto princely pericles;
but since my landing i have understood
your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,
my message must return from whence it came.

helicanus.
we have no reason to desire it,
commended to our master, not to us:
yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,
as friends to antioch, we may feast in tyre.

knights,
to say you're welcome were superfluous.
to place upon the volume of your deeds,
as in a title-page, your worth in arms,
were more than you expect, or more than's fit,
since every worth in show commends itself.
prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:
you are princes and my guests.

thaisa.
but you, my knight and guest;
to whom this wreath of victory i give,
and crown you king of this day's happiness.
