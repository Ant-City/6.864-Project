babette, disheveled, has the careless dignity of someone too preoccupied with serious matters to
know  or  care  what  she  looks  like.  not  that  she  is  a  gift-bearer  of  great  things  as  the  world  generally
reckons  them.  she  gathers  and  tends  the  children,  teaches  a  course  in  an  adult  education  program,
belongs to a group of volunteers who read to the blind. once a week she reads to an elderly man named
treadwell who lives on the edge of town. he is known as old man treadwell, as if he were a landmark, a
rock formation or brooding swamp. she reads to him from the national enquirer, the national examiner,
the  national  express,  the  globe,  the  world,  the  star.  the  old  fellow  demands  his  weekly  dose  of  cult
mysteries.  why  deny  him?  the  point  is  that  babette,  whatever  she  is  doing,  makes  me  feel  sweetly
rewarded,  bound  up  with  a  full-souled  woman,  a  lover  of  daylight  and  dense  life,  the  miscellaneous
swarming  air  of  fami

sooty  sock.  babette  hummed  something  from  a  broadway  show,  putting  the  rods  in  a  corner.  we
embraced,  fell  sideways  to  the  bed  in  a  controlled  way,  then  repositioned  ourselves,  bathing  in  each
other's flesh, trying to kick the sheets off our ankles. her body had a number of long hollows, places the
hand might stop to solve in the dark, tempo-slowing places.

we believed something lived in the basement.
"what do you want to do?" she said.
"whatever you want to do."
"i want to do whatever's best for you."
"what's best for me is to please you," i said.
"i want to make you happy, jack."
"i'm happy when i'm pleasing you."
"i just want to do what you want to do."
"i want to do whatever's best for you."
"but you please me by letting me please you," she said.

paper, she and the police chief, hollis wright, sat in the mobile home while she looked at photos of the
treadwells and smelled articles from their wardrobe. then she asked the chief to leave her alone for an
hour.  she  did  exercises,  ate  some  rice  and  dahl,  proceeded  to  trance  in.  during  this  altered  state,  the
report  went  on,  she  attempted  to  put  a  data  trace  on  whatever  distant  physical  systems  she  wished  to
locate, in this case old man treadwell and his sister. when chief wright re-entered the trailer,  adele t.
told him to forget the river and to concentrate on dry land with a moonscape look about it, within a fifteen-
mile radius of the treadwell home. the police went at once to a gypsum processing operation ten miles
down river, where they found an airline bag that contained a handgun and two kilos of uncut heroin.

the  police  had  consulted  adele  t.  on  a  number  of  occasions  and  she  had  led  them  to  two

i studied the faces in the semicircle. no one seemed amazed by this account. old man treadwell
lit a cigarette, impatient with his own trembling hand, forced to shake out the flame before it burned him.
there was no interest shown in discussion.  the story occupied some recess of passive belief. there  it
was, familiar and comforting in its own strange way, a set of statements no less real than our daily quota
of  observable  household  fact.  even  babette  in  her  tone  of  voice  betrayed  no  sign  of  skepticism  or
condescension. surely i was in no position to feel superior to the

"i'm just going to aisle five."

"i don't want to be alone, jack. i believe you know that."

"we're  going  to  come  through  this  thing  all  right,"  i  said.  "maybe  stronger  than  ever.  we're

determined to be well. babette is not a neurotic person. she is strong, healthy, outgoing, affirmative. she
says yes to things. this is the point of babette."

we stayed together in the aisles and at the checkout. babette bought three tabloids for her next
session with old man treadwell. we read them together as we waited on line. then we went together to
