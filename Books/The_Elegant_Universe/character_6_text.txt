 quantum
mechanics, it undeniably shows that the universe is founded on principles that, from the standpoint of
our day-to-day experiences, are bizarre.

the  meta-lesson  of  both  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  is  that  when  we  deeply  probe  the
fundamental workings of the universe we may come upon aspects that are vastly different from our
expectations. the boldness of asking deep questions may require unforeseen flexibility if we are to
accept the answers.

feynman's perspective

richard feynman was one of the greatest theoretical physicists since einstein. he fully accepted the
probabilistic  core  of  quantum  mechanics,  but  in  the  years  following  world  war  ii  he  offered  a
powerful  new  way  of  thinking  about  the  theory.  from  the  standpoint  of  numerical  predictions,
feynman's perspective agrees exactly with all that went before. but its formulation is quite different.
let's describe it in the context of the electron two-slit experiment.

the troubling thing about

selves be approximations to reality. but this notion of approximate
has nothing to do with our discussion in this chapter. here we are concerned with the fact that within
a chosen theory, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to extract the exact predictions that the theory
makes.  instead,  we  have  to  extract  such  predictions  using  approximation  methods  based  on  a
perturbative approach.

4. these diagrams are string theory versions of the so-called feynman diagrams, invented by

richard feynman for performing perturbative calculations in point-particle quantum field theory.

5. more precisely, every virtual string pair, that is, every loop in a given diagram, contributes—
among other more complicated terms—a multiplicative factor of the string coupling constant. more
loops translate into more factors of the string coupling constant. if the string coupling constant is less
than  1,  repeated  multiplications  make  the  overall  contribution  ever  smaller;  if  it  is  1  or  large
