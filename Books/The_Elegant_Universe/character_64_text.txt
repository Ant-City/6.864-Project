that the essential concern of special relativity is to understand precisely how the world appears to

seem  to  be  an  intellectual  exercise  of  minimal  importance.  quite  the  contrary:  in  the  hands  of
einstein, with his imaginings of observers chasing after light beams, there are profound implications
to grasping fully how even the most mundane situations appear to individuals in relative motion.

our object's motion changes while its speed stays fixed. specifically, we consider motion in a circle
such  as  what  one  experiences  on  the  tornado  ride  in  an  amusement  park.  in  case  you  have  never
tested the stability of your constitution on this ride, you stand with your back against the inside of a
circular plexiglas structure that spins at a high speed. like all accelerated motion, you can feel this
motion—you  feel  your  body  being  pulled  radially  away  from  the  ride's  center  and  you  feel  the
circular wall of plexiglas pressing on your back, keeping you moving in a circle. (in fact, although not
relevant for the present discussion, the spinning motion "pins" your body to the plexiglas with such a
force that when the ledge on which you are standing drops away you do not slip downward.) if the

support of a bed—can almost make you feel that you are lying down. the "almost" comes from the
fact that you still feel ordinary "vertical" gravity, so your brain cannot be fully fooled. but if you were
to ride the tornado in outer space, and if it were to spin at just the right rate, it would feel just like
lying in a stationary bed on earth. moreover, were you to "get up" and walk along the interior of the
spinning plexiglas, your feet would press against it just as they do against an earthbound floor. in fact,
space stations are designed to spin in this manner to create an artificial feeling of gravity in outer
space.

what about the radius? well, jim also uses the head-to-tail method to find the length of a radial
strut, and from our bird's-eye view we see that he is going to find the same answer as we did. the
reason is that the ruler is not pointing along the instantaneous direction of the motion

of the ride (as it
is when measuring the circumference). instead, it is pointed at a ninety-degree angle to the motion,
and  therefore  it  is not  contracted  along  its  length.  jim  will  therefore  find  exactly  the  same  radial
length as we did.

having  used  the  accelerated  motion  of  the  spinning  tornado  to  imitate  gravity,  we  can  now
follow einstein and set out to see how space and time appear to someone on the ride. his reasoning,
adapted  to  this  situation,  went  as  follows.  we  stationary  observers  can  easily  measure  the
circumference and the radius of the spinning ride. for instance, to measure the circumference we can
carefully  lay  out  a  ruler—head  to  tail—alongside  the  ride's  spinning  girth;  for  its  radius  we  can
similarly use the head-to-t

ail method working our way from the central axle of the ride to its outer
rim. as we anticipate from high-school geometry, we find that their ratio is two times the number pi
—about 6.28—just as it is for any circle drawn on a flat sheet of paper. but what do things look like
from the perspective of someone on the ride itself?

to find out, we ask slim and jim, who are currently enjoying a spin on the tornado, to take a
few  measurements  for  us.  we  toss  one  of  our  rulers  to  slim,  who  sets  out  to  measure  the
circumference of the ride, and another to jim, who sets out to measure the radius. to get the clearest
perspective, let's take a bird's-eye view of the ride, as in figure 3.1. we have adorned this snapshot
of the ride with an arrow that indicates the momentary direction of motion at each point. as slim
begins to measure the circumference, we immediately see from our

 flat surface; the curved nature of the saddle's surface causes
the radial lines of the circle to splay outward from each other slightly, resulting in a small increase in
the circle's circumference. these observations imply that the ratio of the circumference to the radius
of the circle in (b) will be less than two times pi, while the same ratio in (c) will be greater than two
times pi. but this deviation from two times pi, especially the larger value found in (c), is just what we
found for the spinning tornado ride. this led einstein to propose an idea—the curving of space—as
an explanation for the violation of "ordinary," euclidean geometry. the flat geometry of the greeks,
taught to schoolchildren for thousands of years, simply does not apply to someone on the spinning
ride. rather, its curved space generalization as schematically drawn in part (c) of figure 3.2 takes its
place.5

and therefore the faster you must go. but from special relativity, the faster you go, the slower your
watch ticks, and hence we realize that slim's watch will tick more slowly than jim's. furthermore,
slim and jim will find that, as jim gets closer to slim, the ticking rate of jim's watch will slow down,
approaching that of slim's. this reflects the fact that as jim gets farther out along the strut, his circular
speed increases toward that of slim.

we conclude that to observers on the spinning ride, such as slim and jim, the rate of passage of
time depends upon their precise position—in this case, their distance from the center of the ride. this
is an illustration of what we mean by warped time: time is warped if its rate of passage differs from
one location to another. and of particular importance to our present discussion, jim will also notice
something  else  as  he  crawls  out  along  the  strut.  he  will  feel  an  increasingly  strong  outward  pull

slower clocks—that is, greater acceleration results in a more significant warping of time.

these  observations  took  einstein  to  the  final  leap.  since  he  had  already  shown  gravity  and
accelerated motion to be effectively indistinguishable, and since he now had shown that accelerated
motion  is  associated  with  the  warping  of  space  and  time,  he  made  the  followi

 in  1967  physicists  sidney  coleman  and  jeffrey  mandula  were  able  to
prove that no other symmetries associated with space, time, or motion could be combined with those
just discussed and result in a theory bearing any resemblance to our world.

subsequently,  though,  close  examination  of  this  theorem,  based  on  insights  of  a  number  of
physicists revealed precisely one subtle loophole: the coleman-mandula result did not exploit fully
symmetries sensitive to something known as spin.

an elementary particle such as an electron can orbit an atomic nucleus in somewhat the same way that
the  earth  orbits  the  sun.  but,  in  the  traditional  point-particle  description  of  an  electron,  it  would

e off of any purported spin axis. and so it
would  appear  that  there  simply  is  no  notion  of  a  point  object  spinning.  many  years  ago,  such
reasoning fell prey to yet another quantum-mechanical surprise.

in 1925, the dutch physicists george uhlenbeck and samuel goudsmit realized that a wealth of
puzzling data having to do with properties of light emitted and absorbed by atoms could be explained
if electrons were assumed to have very particular magnetic properties. some hundred years earlier,
the  frenchman andre-marie ampère  had  shown  that  magnetism  arises  from  the  motion  of  electric
charge
 
 ___________________________
 
. uhlenbeck and goudsmit followed this lead and found that only one specific sort of electron
motion could give rise to the magnetic properties suggested by the data: rotational motion—that is,
spin. contrary to classical expectations, uhlenbeck and goudsmit proclaimed that, somewhat like the
earth, electrons both revolve and rotate.

did uhlenbeck and goudsmit literally mean that the electron is spinning? yes and no. what their
work really showed is that there is a quantum-mechanical notion of spin that is somewhat akin to the
usual  image  but  inherently  quantum  mechanical  in  nature.  it's  one  of  those  properties  of  the
microscopic  world  that  brushes  up  against  classical  ideas  but  injects  an  experimentally  verified
quantum  twist.  for  instance,  picture  a  spinning  skater.  as  she  pulls  her  arms  in  she  spins  more
quickly; as she stretches out her arms she

 spins more slowly. and sooner or later, depending on how
vigorously she threw herself into the spin, she will slow down and stop. not so for the kind of spin
revealed by uhlenbeck and goudsmit. according to their work and subsequent studies, every electron
in  the  universe,  always  and  forever, spins  at  one  fixed  and  never  changing  rate.  the  spin  of  an
electron is not a transitory state of motion as for more familiar objects that, for some reason or other,
happen to be spinning. instead, the spin of an electron is an intrinsic property, much like its mass or
its electric charge. if an electron were not spinning, it would not be an electron.

with this background on the concept of spin, let's now turn to the role it plays in revealing the

although  early  work  focused  on  the  electron,  physicists  have  subsequently  shown  that  these
ideas about spin apply equally well to all of the matter particles that fill out the three families of
table 1.1. this is true

 down to the last detail: all of the matter particles (and their antimatter partners
as well) have spin equal to that of the electron. in the language of the trade, physicists say that matter
particles  all  have  "spin-1/2,"  where  the  value  1/2  is,  roughly  speaking,  a  quantum-mechanical
measure  of  how  quickly  the  particles  rotate.2  moreover,  physicists  have  shown  that  the
nongravitational force carriers—photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—also possess an intrinsic
spinning characteristic that turns out to be twice that of the matter particles. they all have "spin-1."

what  about  gravity?  well,  even  before  string  theory,  physicists  were  able  to  determine  what
spin the hypothesized graviton must have to be the transmitter of the gravitational force. the answer:
twice the spin of photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—i.e., "spin-2."

in the context of string theory, spin—just like mass and force charges—is associated with the

tion that a string executes. as with point particles, it's a bit misleading to think of the
spin carried by a string as arising from its spinning literally around in space, but this image does give
a loose picture to have in mind. by the way, we can now clarify an important issue we encountered
earlier. in 1974, when scherk and schwarz proclaimed that string theory should be thought of as a
quantum theory incorporating the gravitational force, they did so because they had found that strings
necessarily  have  a  vibrational  pattern  in  their  repertoire  that  is massless  and  has  spin-2—the
hallmark features of the graviton. w

supersymmetry and superpartners

as we have emphasized, the concept of spin, although superficially akin to the image of a spinning
top, differs in substantial ways that are rooted in quantum mechanics. its discovery in 1925 revealed
that  there  is  another  kind  of  rotational  motion  that  simply  would  not  exist  in  a  purely  classical
universe.

this suggests the following question: just as ordinary rotational motion allows for the symmetry
principle of rotational invariance ("physics treats all spatial orientations on an equal footing"), could
it be that the more subtle rotational motion associated with spin

 leads to another possible symmetry of
the  laws  of  nature?  by  1971  or  so,  physicists  showed  that  the  answer  to  this  question  was  yes.
although  the  full  story  is  quite  involved,  the  basic  idea  is  that  when  spin  is  considered,  there  is
precisely one more symmetry of the laws of nature that is mathematically possible. it is known as
supersymmetry.3

supersymmetry cannot be associated with a simple and intuitive change in observational vantage
point; shifts in time, in spatial location, in angular orientation, and in velocity of motion exhaust these
possibilities.  but  just  as  spin  is  "like  rotational  motion,  with  a  quantum-mechanical  twist,"
supersymmetry  can  be  associated  with  a  ch

e  a  rough  sense  of  where  supersymmetry  fits  into  the  larger  framework  of
symmetry  principles.4  nevertheless,  although  understanding  the  origin  of  supersymmetry  is  rather
subtle, we will focus on one of its primary implications—should the laws of nature incorporate its
principles—and this is far easier to grasp.

in  the  early  1970s,  physicists  realized  that  if  the  universe  is  supersymmetric,  the  particles  of
nature  must  come  in pairs  whose  respective  spins  differ  by  half  a  unit.  such  pairs  of  particles—
regardless of whether they are thought of as pointlike (as in the standard model) or as tiny vibrating
loops—are called superpartners. since matter particles have spin-1/2 while some of the messenger
particles  have  spin-1,  supersymmetry  appears  to  result  in  a  pairing—a  partnering—of  matter  and
force  particles.  as  such,  it  seems  like  a  wonderful  unifying  concept.  the  problem  comes  in  the
details.

by the

 mid-1970s, when physicists sought to incorporate supersymmetry into the standard model,
they found that none of the known particles—those of tables 1.1 and 1.2—could be superpartners of
one  another.  instead,  detailed  theoretical  analysis  showed  that  if  the  universe  incorporates
supersymmetry, then every known particle must have an as-yet-undiscovered superpartner particle,
whose  spin  is  half  a  unit  less  than  its  known  counterpart.  for  instance,  there  should  be  a  spin-0
partner  of  the  electron;  this  hypothetical  particle  has  been  named  the selectron  (a  contraction  of
supersymmetric-electron).  the  same  should  also  be  true  for  the  other  matter  particles,  with,  for
example, the hypothetical spin-0 superpartners of neutrinos and quarks being called sneutrinos and
squarks. similarly, the force particles should have spin-1/2 superpartners: for photons there should
be photinos, for the gluons there should be gluinos, for the w and z bosons

constructed that it falls apart if a number on which it depends is changed in the fifteenth digit after the
decimal point.5

supersymmetry  changes  this  drastically  because bosons—particles  whose  spin  is  a  whole
number (named after the indian physicist satyendra bose)—and fermions—particles whose spin is
half  of  a  whole  (odd)  number  (named  after  the  italian  physicist  enrico  fermi)—tend  to  give
cancelling  quantum-mechanical  contributions.  like  opposite  ends  of  a  seesaw,  when  the  quantum
jitters  of  a  boson  are  positive,  those  of  a  fermion  tend  to  be  negative,  and  vice  versa.  since

supersymmetry in string theory

the original string theory that emerged from veneziano's work in the late 1960s incorporated all of
the symmetries discussed at the beginning of this chapter, but it did not incorporate supersymmetry
(which  had  not  yet  been  discovered).  this  first  theory  based  on  the  string  concept  was,  more
precisely,  called  the bosonic string theory.  the  name bosonic  indicates  that  all  of  the  vibrational
patterns of the bosonic string have spins that are a whole number—there are no fermionic patterns,
that is, no patterns with spins differing from a whole number by a half unit. this led to two problems.
first,  if  string  theory  was  to  describe  all  forces  and  all  matter,  it  would  somehow  have  to
incorporate  fermionic  vibrational  patterns,  since  the  known  matter  particles  all  have  spin-1/2.
second, and far more troubling, was the realization that there was one pattern of vibration in bosonic

gravity."1 what witten means by this is that both newton and einstein developed theories of gravity
because their observations of the world clearly showed them that gravity exists, and that, therefore, it
required an accurate and consistent explanation. on the contrary, a physicist studying string theory—
even if he or she was completely unaware of general relativity—would be inexorably led to it by the
string framework. through its massless spin-2 graviton pattern of vibration, string theory has gravity
thoroughly sewn into its theoretical fabric. as witten has said, "the fact that gravity is a consequence
of  string  theory  is  one  of  the  greatest  theoretical  insights  ever."2  in  acknowledging  that  this
"prediction" is more precisely labeled a "postdiction" because physicists had discovered theoretical
descriptions of gravity before they knew of string theory, witten points out that this is a mere accident

e  preceding  discussion  gives  some  idea  of  how  string  theory  may  one  day  explain  the
properties of the matter particles recorded in table 1.1. string theorists believe that a similar story
will one day also explain the properties of the messenger particles of the fundamental forces, listed in
table 1.2. that is, as strings twist and vibrate while meandering through the extended and curled-up
dimensions, a small subset of their vast oscillatory repertoire consists of vibrations with spin equal to
1 or 2. these are the candidate force-carrying string-vibrational states. regardless of the shape of the
calabi-yau space, there is always one vibrational pattern that is massless and has spin-2; we identify
this pattern as the graviton. the precise list of spin-1 messenger particles—their number, the strength
of the force they convey, the gauge symmetries they respect—though, does depend crucially on the
precise geometrical form of the curled-up dimensions. and so, once again, we

hall return to other examples, but for now
we focus on one: supersymmetry.

as  we  have  discussed,  a  fundamental  property  of  string  theory  is  that  it  is  highly  symmetric,
incorporating  not  only  intuitive  symmetry  principles  but  respecting,  as  well,  the  maximal
mathematical extension of these principles, supersymmetry. this means, as discussed in chapter 7,
that patterns of string vibrations come in pairs—superpartner pairs—differing from each other by a
half unit of spin. if string theory is right, then some of the string vibrations will correspond to the
known  elementary  particles.  and  due  to  the  supersymmetric  pairing,  string  theory  makes  the
prediction  that  each  such  known  particle  will  have  a  superpartner.  we  can  determine  the  force
charges that each of these superpartner particles should carry, but we do not currently have the ability
to predict their masses. even so, the prediction that superpartners exist is a generic feature of

hunk of space collapses—in this case, a spherical piece of a calabi-yau shape—as opposed to the
collapse  of  a  complete  spatial  dimension,  the  argument  identifying  small  and  large  radii  is  not
directly applicable. nevertheless, even though this idea for ruling out flop transitions does not stand
up to scrutiny, the possibility that the fabric of space could tear still seemed rather unlikely.

but  then,  in  1991  the  norwegian  physicist  andy  lütken  together  with  paul  aspinwall,  a
graduate-school  classmate  of  mine  from  oxford  and  now  a  professor  at  duke  university,  asked
themselves  what  proved  to  be  a  very  interesting  question:  if  the  spatial  fabric  of  the  calabi-yau
portion of our universe were to undergo a space-tearing flop transition, what would it look like from
the perspective of the mirror calabi-yau space? to understand the motivation for this question, you
must recall that the physics emerging from either member of a mirror pa

selected for the extra dimensions) is identical, but the complexity of the mathematics that a physicist

must employ to extract the physics can differ significantly between the two. aspinwall and lütken
speculated that the mathematically complicated flop transition of figures 11.3 and 11.4 might have a
far  simpler  mirror  description—one  that  might  give  a  more  transparent  view  on  the  associated
physics.

at the time of their work, mirror symmetry was not understood at the depth required to answer
the question they posed. however, aspinwall and lütken noted that there did not seem to be anything
in the mirror description that would indicate a disastrous physical c

ror  pairs  of  calabi-yau  shapes  (see  chapter  10)  unexpectedly  led  us  to  think  about  flop
transitions  as  well.  it  is  a  well-known  mathematical  fact  that  gluing  various  points  together  as  in
figure 10.4—the procedure we had used to construct mirror pairs—leads to geometrical situations
that are identical to the pinch and puncture in figures 11.3 and 11.4. physically, though, plesser and i
could find no associated calamity. moreover, inspired by the observations of aspinwall and lütken
(as well as a previous paper of theirs with graham ross), plesser and i realized that we could repair
the  pinch  mathematically  in  two  different  ways.  one  way  led  to  the  calabi-yau  shape  in  figure
11.3(a)  while  the  other  led  to  that  in  figure  11.4(d).  this  suggested  to  us  that  the  evolution  from
figure 11.3(a) through figure 11.4(d) was something that could actually occur in nature.

methods of his paper, if properly understood and applied, could very well open a new line of attack
on the issue of space-tearing flop transitions.

by  late  summer,  energized  by  these  developments,  i  decided  that  i  wanted  to  return  to  the
problem of flops with full and undistracted intensity. i had learned from morrison that he was going
on leave from duke to spend a year at the institute for advanced study, and i knew that aspinwall
would also be there, as a postdoctoral fellow. after a few phone calls and e-mails, i arranged to take
leave from cornell university and spend the fall of 1992 at the institute as well.

one would be hard pressed to think of a more ideal place for long hours of intense concentration than
the institute for advanced study. founded in 1930, it is set within gently rolling fields on the border
of an idyllic forest a few miles from the campus of princeton university. it is sa

 the institute, because, well, there aren't any distractions.

after leaving germany in 1933, einstein joined the institute and remained there for the duration
of his life. it takes little imagination to picture him pondering unified field theory in the institute's
quiet, lonely, almost ascetic surroundings. the legacy of deep thought infuses the atmosphere, which,
depending on your own immediate state of progress, can be either exciting or oppressive.

shortly after arriving at the institute, aspinwall and i were walking down nassau street (the
main commercial street in the town of princeton) trying to agree on a place to have dinner. this was
no small task since paul is as devout a meat eater as i am a vegetarian. in the midst of catching up on
each other's lives as we were walking along, he asked me if i had any ideas about new things to work

calculation: extract the physical properties of the universe for the upper calabi-yau shape after the
tear (using, say, the upper-right calabi-yau shape in figure 11.5) and for its supposed mirror (the
lower-right calabi-yau shape in figure 11.5), and see if they are identical.

edward  witten's  razor-sharp  intellect  is  clothed  in  a  soft-spoken  demeanor  that  often  has  a  wry,
almost ironic, edge. he is widely regarded as einstein's successor in the role of the world's greatest

pursue.  he  lit  up  upon  hearing  the  ideas,  but  cautioned  that  he  thought  the  calculations  would  be
horrendously difficult. he also pointed out a potential weak link in the strategy i described, having to
do with some work i had done a few years earlier with vafa and warner. the issue he raised turned
out to be only tangential to our approach for understanding flops, but it started him thinking about
what ultimately turned out to be related and complementary issues.

aspinwall,  morrison,  and  i  decided  to  split  our  calculation  in  two  pieces. at  first  a  natural
division might have seemed to involve first extracting the physics associated with the final calabi-
yau shape from the upper row of figure 11.5, and then doing the same for the final calabi-yau shape
from the lower row of figure 11.5. if the mirror relationship is not shattered by the tear in the upper
calabi-yau, then these two final calabi-yau shapes should yield identical physics, just like

a  procedure  for  accomplishing  the  second  task—extracting  the  physical  features  of  the  final
calabi-yau space in the lower row, once its shape was precisely known—had been worked out a
few years earlier by candelas. his approach, however, was calculationally intensive and we realized
that it would require a clever computer program to carry it out in our explicit example. aspinwall,
who  in  addition  to  being  a  renowned  physicist  is  a  crackerjack  programmer,  took  on  this  task.
morrison  and  i  set  out  to  accomplish  the  first  task,  namely,  to  identify  the  precise  shape  of  the
candidate mirror calabi-yau space.

it  was  here  that  we  felt  batyrev's  work  could  provide  us  some  important  clues.  once  again,

of  translation  between  the  physics  of  string  theory  and  the  mathematics  of  the  calabi-yau  spaces.
aspinwall,  morrison,  and  i  had  almost  daily  impromptu  meetings  with  witten  at  which  he  would
show us new insights following from his approach. as the weeks went by, it gradually became clear
that unexpectedly, his work, from a vantage point completely different from our own, was converging
on the issue of flop transitions. aspinwall, morrison, and i realized that if we didn't complete our
calculation soon, witten would beat us to the punch.

cuses the mind of a physicist like a healthy dose of competition. aspinwall, morrison, and
i went into high gear. it's important to note that this meant one thing to morrison and me, and quite
another  to aspinwall. aspinwall  is  a  curious  mixture  of  upper-class  british  sensibility,  largely  a
reflection of the decade he spent at oxford as both an undergraduate and a graduate student, infused
ever  so  slightly  with  a  prankster's  roguishness. as  far  as  work  habits  go,  he  is  perhaps  the  most
civilized physicist i know. while many of us work deep into the evening, he never works past 5 p.m.
while many of us work weekends, aspinwall does not. he gets away with this because he is both
sharp and

 efficient. going into high gear for him merely amounts to notching up his efficiency level to
even greater heights.

by  this  time,  it  was  early  december.  morrison  and  i  had  been  lecturing  to  one  another  for
several months and it was starting to pay off. we were very close to being able to identify the precise
shape of the calabi-yau space we were seeking. moreover, aspinwall had just about finished his
computer code, and he now awaited our result, which would be the required input for his program. it
was a thursday night when morrison and i finally had confidence that we knew how to identify the
sought-after calabi-yau shape. that, too, boiled down to a procedure that required its own, fairly
simple,  computer  code.  by  friday  afternoon  we  had  written  the  program  and  debugged  it;  by  late
friday night we had our result.

but it was after 5 p.m. and 
 
 ___________________________
 
it was friday. aspinwall had gone home and would not return until
monday. there was nothing we could do without his computer code. neither morrison nor i could
imagine  waiting  out  the  whole  weekend.  we  were  on  the  verge  of  answering  the  long-pondered
question  of  spatial  tears  in  the  fabric  of  the  cosmos,  and  the  suspense  was  too  much  to  bear.  we
called aspinwall at home. at first he refused to come to work the next morning as we asked. but then,
after much groaning, he consented to join us, as long as we bought him a six-pack of beer. we agreed.

a moment of truth

we  all  met  at  the  institute  saturday  morning  as  planned.  it  was  a  bright  sunny  morning,  and  the
atmosphere was jokingly relaxed. i, for one, half expected that aspinwall would not show up; once he
did,  i  spent  15  minutes  extolling  the  import  of  this  first  wee

kend  he  had  come  into  the  office.  he
assured me it wouldn't happen again.

we  all  huddled  around  morrison's  computer  in  the  office  he  and  i  shared.  aspinwall  told
morrison how to bring his program up on the screen and showed us the precise form for the required
input. morrison appropriately formatted the results we had generated the previous night, and we were
set to go.

the  particular  calculation  we  were  performing  amounts,  roughly  speaking,  to  determining  the
mass of a certain particle species—a specific vibrational pattern of a string—when moving through a
universe whose calabi-yau component we had spent all fall identifying.

, we
all  realized  that  something  funny  must  be  going  on.  if  there  was  a  real  mismatch  in  the  physics
following from the two shapes, it was extremely unlikely that the computer calculation should yield
an answer so close to a whole number. if our ideas were wrong, there was no reason in the world to
expect  anything  but  a  random  collection  of  digits.  we  had  gotten  a  wrong  answer,  but  one  that
suggested, perhaps, that we had just made some simple arithmetic error. aspinwall and i went to the
blackboard, and in a moment we found our mistake: we had dropped a factor of 3 in the "simpler"
calculation we had done weeks before; the true result was 9. the computer answer was therefore just
what we wanted.

of  course,  the  after-the-fact  agreement  was  only  marginally  convincing.  when  you  know  the
answer you want, it is often all too easy to figure out a way of getting it. we needed to do another
example. having already written all of the necessary computer

e mass on the upper calabi-yau shape, being careful this time to make no
errors. we found the answer: 12. once again, we huddled around the computer and set it on its way.
seconds  later  it  returned  11.999999. agreement.  we  had  shown  that  the  supposed  mirror is  the
mirror, and hence space-tearing flop transitions are part of the physics of string theory.

at this i jumped out of my chair and ran an unrestrained victory lap around the office. morrison
beamed from behind the computer. aspinwall's reaction, though, was rather different. "that's great,
but i knew it would work," he calmly said. "and where's my beer?"

witten's approach

that monday, we triumphantly went to witten and told him of our success. he was very pleased with
our result. and, as it turned out, he too had just found a way of establishing that flop transitions occur

in  string  theory.  his  argument  was  quite  different  from  ours,  and  it  significantly  illuminates  the

but the indirect approach of invoking symmetry under changes of locale is far easier. we could also
learn about features on the left side of the perpetrator's face by tracking him down and examining it.
but it is often far easier to invoke the left-right symmetry of faces.7

supersymmetry  is  a  more  abstract  symmetry  principle  that  relates  physical  properties  of
elementary  constituents  that  carry  different  amounts  of  spin.  at  best  there  are  only  hints  from
experimental  results  that  the  microworld  incorporates  this  symmetry,  but,  for  reasons  discussed
earlier, there is a strong belief that it does. it is certainly an integral part of string theory. in the 1990s,
led by the pioneering work of nathan seiberg of the institute for advanced study, physicists have
realized that supersymmetry provides a sharp and incisive tool that can answer some very difficult
and important questions by indirect mean

found  increasingly  persuasive  evidence  for  what  john  wheeler  has  summarized  by  the  statement
"black holes have no hair." by this, wheeler meant that except for a small number of distinguishing
features, all black holes appear to be alike. the distinguishing features? one, of course, is the black
hole's mass. what are the others? research has revealed that they are the electric and certain other
force charges a black hole can carry, as well as the rate at which it spins. and that's it. any two black
holes with the same mass, force charges, and spin are completely identical. black holes do not have
fancy "hairdos"—that is, other intrinsic traits—that distinguish one from another. this should ring a
loud bell. recall that it is precisely such properties—mass, force charges, and spin—that distinguish
one  elementary  particle  from  another.  the  similarity  of  the  defining  traits  has  led  a  number  of
physicists  over  the  years  to  the  strang

 can imagine a thought experiment in which we start with ever-lighter blobs of matter, crush them
into  ever-smaller  black  holes,  and  compare  the  properties  of  the  resulting  black  holes  with  the
properties of elementary particles. wheeler's no-hair statement leads us to conclude that for small
enough masses the black holes we form in this manner will look very much like elementary particles.
both will look like tiny bundles characterized completely by their mass, force charges, and spin.

but there is a catch. astrophysical black holes, with masses many times that of the sun, are so
large  and  heavy  that  quantum  mechanics  is  largely  irrelevant  and  only  the  equations  of  general
relativity need be used to understand their properties. (we are here discussing the overall structure of
the black hole, not the singular central point of collapse within a black hole, whose tiny size most
certainly  requires  a  quantum-mechanical  description.) as  we  try  to  make  ever

t we would need to work out before we could establish that our second half of the story did not
introduce any singularities—that is, pernicious and physically unacceptable consequences. we each
went home that evening with the tentative elation that we were sitting on a major new insight.

a flurry of e-mail

the next morning i received an e-mail from strominger asking me for any comments or reactions to
his  paper.  he  mentioned  that  "it  should  tie  in  somehow  with  your  work  with  aspinwall  and
morrison,"  because,  as  it  turned  out,  he  too  had  been  exploring  a  possible  connection  to  the
phenomenon  of  topology  change.  i  immediately  sent  him  an  e-mail  describing  the  rough  outline
morrison  and  i  had  come  up  with.  when  he  responded,  it  was  clear  that  his  level  of  excitement
matched what morrison and i had been riding since the preceding day.

evolution to greater total entropy embodied in the second law of thermodynamics. he proposed that
the area of the event horizon of a black hole provides a precise measure of its entropy.

on closer inspection, though, there are two reasons why most physicists thought that bekenstein's
idea could not be right. first, black holes would seem to be among the most ordered and organized
objects in the whole universe. once one measures the black hole's mass, the force charges it carries,
and its spin, its identity has been nailed down precisely. with so few defining features, a black hole
appears to lack sufficient structure to allow for disorder. just as there is little havoc one can wreak
on a desktop that holds solely a book and a pencil, black holes seem too simple to support disorder.
the  second  reason  that  bekenstein's  proposal  was  hard  to  swallow  is  that  entropy,  as  we  have
discussed it here, is a quantum-mechanical concept, whereas black holes, until recently, were fi

 three are perhaps the most important ones to keep firmly in mind. first, gravity and quantum
mechanics are part and parcel of how the universe works and therefore any purported unified theory
must incorporate both. string theory accomplishes this. second, studies by physicists over the past
century  have  revealed  that  there  are  other  key  ideas—many  of  which  have  been  experimentally
confirmed—that appear central to our understanding of the universe. these include the concepts of
spin, the family structure of matter particles, messenger particles, gauge symmetry, the equivalence
principle,  symmetry  breaking,  and  supersymmetry,  to  name  a  few.  all  of  these  concepts  emerge
naturally  from  string  theory.  third,  unlike  more  conventional  theories  such  as  the  standard  model,
which  has  19  free  parameters  that  can  be  adjusted  to  ensure  agreement  with  experimental
measurements,  string  theory  has  no  adjustable  parameters.  in  principle,  its

chapter 1

1. the table below is an elaboration of table 1.1. it records the masses and force charges of the
particles of all three families. each type of quark can carry three possible strong-force charges that
are, somewhat fancifully, labeled as colors—they stand for numerical strong-force charges values.
the weak charges recorded are, more precisely, the "third-component" of weak isospin. (we have
not listed the "right-handed" components of the particles—they differ by having no weak charge.)

2. strings can also have two freely moving ends (so-called open strings) in addition to the loops
(closed strings) illustrated in figure 1.1. to ease our presentation, for the most part we will focus on
closed strings, although essentially all of what we say applies to both.

xt we have followed the spirit of einstein's own analysis, and
in this endnote we continue to take this viewpoint and seek to clarify a couple of features that you may
have  found  confusing.  first,  you  may  be  puzzled  about  why  the  circumference  of  the  ride  is  not
lorentz contracted in exactly the same way as the ruler, and hence measured by slim to have the same
length  as  we  originally  found.  bear  in  mind,  though,  that  throughout  our  discussion  the  ride  was
always  spinning;  we never  analyzed  the  ride  when  it  was  at  rest.  thus,  from  our  perspective  as
stationary  observers,  the  only  difference  between  our  and  slim's  measurement  of  the  ride's
circumference is that slim's ruler is lorentz contracted; the spinning tornado ride was spinning when
we performed our measurement, and it is spinning as we watch slim carry out his. since we see that

his ruler is contracted, we realize that he will have to lay it out more times to traverse the e

circumference,  thereby  measuring  a  longer  length  than  we  did.  lorentz  contraction  of  the  ride's
circumference  would  have  been  relevant  only  if  we  compared  the  properties  of  the  ride  when
spinning and when at rest, but this is a comparison we did not need.

second, notwithstanding the fact that we did not need to analyze the ride when it was at rest, you
may still be wondering about what would happen when it does slow down and stop. now, it would
seem,  we  must  take  account  of  the  changing  circumference  with  changing  speed  due  to  different
degrees of lorentz contraction. but how can this be squared with an unchanging radius? this is a
subtle problem whose resolution hing

es on the fact that there are no fully rigid objects in the real
world. objects can stretch and bend and thereby accommodate the stretching or contracting we have
come  upon;  if  not,  as  einstein  pointed  out,  a  rotating  disk  that  was  initially  formed  by  allowing  a
spinning cast of molten metal to cool while in motion would break apart if its rate of spinning were
subsequently  changed.  for  more  details  on  the  history  of  the  rigidly  rotating  disk,  see  stachel,
"einstein and the rigidly rotating disk."

a uniformly rotating frame of reference, the curved three-dimensional spatial sections on which we
have focused fit together into a four-dimensional spacetime whose curvature still vanishes.

efly summarize the differences between the five string theories. to do so, we note that
vibrational disturbances along a loop of string can travel clockwise or counterclockwise. the type
iia  and  type  iib  strings  differ  in  that  in  the  latter  theory,  these  clockwise/counterclockwise
vibrations  are  identical,  while  in  the  former,  they  are  exactly  opposite  in  form. opposite  has  a
precise mathematical meaning in this context, but it's easiest to think about in terms of the spins of the
resulting vibrational patterns in each theory. in the type iib theory, it turns out that all particles spin
in the same direction (they have the same chirality), whereas in the type iia theory, they spin in both
directions  (they  have  both  chiralities).  nevertheless,  each  theory  incorporates  supersymmetry.  the
two  heterotic  theories  differ  in  a  similar  but  more  dramatic  way.  each  of  their  clockwise  string
vibrations looks like those of the type ii string (when fo

the other is small.

10. this is a close analog of the r, 1/r duality discussed previously. if we call the type iib
string coupling constant giib then the statement that appears to be true is that the values giib and 1/giib
describe the same physics. if giib is big, 1/giib is small, and vice versa.

11. if all but four dimensions are curled up, a theory with more than eleven total dimensions
necessarily gives rise to massless particles with spin greater than 2, something that both theoretical
and experimental considerations rule out.

12. a  notable  exception  is  the  important  1987  work  of  duff,  paul  howe,  takeo  inami,  and
kelley stelle in which they drew on earlier insights of eric bergshoeff, ergin sezgin, and townsend
to argue that ten-dimensional string theory should have a deep eleven-dimensional connection.
