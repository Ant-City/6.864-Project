s exclusively of one syllable, the delta mirror. then came the bu- 
reaux of propaganda by television, by feeling picture, and by syn- 
thetic voice and music respectively-twenty-two floors of them. above 
were the search laboratories and the padded rooms in which sound- 



track writers and synthetic composers did the delicate work. the top 
eighteen floors were occupied the college of emotional engineering. 

bernard landed on the roof of propaganda house and stepped out. 

"ring down to mr. helmholtz watson," he ordered the gamma-plus 
porter, "and tell him that mr. bernard marx is waiting for him on the 
roof." 

he sat down and lit a cigarette. 

helmholtz watson was writing when the message came down. 

"tell him i'm coming at once," he said and hung up the receiver. then, 
turning to his secretary, "i'll leave you to put my things away," he went 
on in the same official and impersonal tone; and, ignoring her lustrous 
smile, got up and walked briskly to the door.

llege of emotional engineering (department of 
writing) and the intervals of his educational activities, a working emo- 
tional engineer. he wrote regularly for the hourly radio, composed 
feely scenarios, and had the happiest knack for slogans and hyp- 
nopaedic rhymes. 

"able," was the verdict of his superiors. "perhaps, (and they would 
shake their heads, would significantly lower their voices) "a little too 
able." 

yes, a little too able; they were right. a mental excess had produced in 
helmholtz watson effects very similar to those which, in bernard marx, 
were the result of a physical defect. too little bone and brawn had iso- 
lated bernard from his fellow men, and the sense of this apartness, 
being, by all the current standards, a mental excess, became in its 
turn a cause of wider separation. that which had made helmholtz so 
uncomfortably aware of being himself and all alone was too much abil- 
ity. what the two men shared was the knowledge that they were indi- 



viduals. but whereas

the physically defective bernard had suffered all 
his life from the consciousness of being separate, it was only quite re- 
cently that, grown aware of his mental excess, helmholtz watson had 
also become aware of his difference from the people who surrounded 
him. this escalator-squash champion, this indefatigable lover (it was 
said that he had had six hundred and forty different girls in under four 
years), this admirable committee man and best mixer had realized 
quite suddenly that sport, women, communal activities were only, so 
far as he was concerned, second bests. really, and at the bottom, he 
was interested in something else. but in what? in what? that was the

"i'm sorry," said bernard, feeling and looking uncomfortably foolish. "i 
suppose i've got things on my nerves a bit. when people are suspi- 
cious with you, you start being suspicious with them." 

he passed his hand across his eyes, he sighed, his voice became plain- 
tive. he was justifying himself. "if you knew what i'd had to put up 
with recently," he said almost tearfully-and the uprush of his self-pity 
was like a fountain suddenly released. "if you only knew!" 

helmholtz watson listened with a certain sense of discomfort. "poor lit- 
tle bernard!" he said to himself. but at the same time he felt rather 
ashamed for his friend. he wished bernard would show a little more 
pride. 



chapter five 



by eight o'clock the light was failing. the loud speaker in the tower 
of the stoke poges club house began, in a more than human tenor, to 
announce the closing of the courses. lenina and henry abandoned 
their game and walked back towards the club. from the grounds of

people simply weren't transferred for things like that. iceland was just 
a threat. a most stimulating and life-giving threat. walking along the 
corridor, he actually whistled. 

heroic was the account he gave that evening of his interview with the 
d.h.c. "whereupon," it concluded, "i simply told him to go to the bot- 
tomless past and marched out of the room. and that was that." he 
looked at helmholtz watson expectantly, awaiting his due reward of 
sympathy, encouragement, admiration. but no word came. helmholtz 
sat silent, staring at the floor. 

he liked bernard; he was grateful to him for being the only man of his 
acquaintance with whom he could talk about the subjects he felt to be 
important. nevertheless, there were things in bernard which he hated. 
this boasting, for example. and the outbursts of an abject self-pity 
with which it alternated. and his deplorable habit of being bold after

our distinct sub-reservations, each surrounded by a high-tension wire 
fence." 

at this moment, and for no apparent reason, bernard suddenly re- 
membered that he had left the eau de cologne tap in his bathroom 
wide open and running. 

"... supplied with current from the grand canyon hydro-electric sta- 
tion." 

"cost me a fortune by the time i get back." with his mind's eye, ber- 
nard saw the needle on the scent meter creeping round and round, 
antlike, indefatigable. "quickly telephone to helmholtz watson." 

"... upwards of five thousand kilometres of fencing at sixty thousand 
volts." 

"you don't say so," said lenina politely, not knowing in the least what 
the warden had said, but taking her cue from his dramatic pause. 
when the warden started booming, she had inconspicuously swallowed 
half a gramme of soma, with the result that she could now sit, se- 
renely not listening, thinking of nothing at all, but with her large blue 
eyes fixed on the warden's face in an expression of rapt attenti

they got away at last. bernard dashed to the telephone. quick, quick; 
but it took him nearly three minutes to get on to helmholtz watson. 
"we might be among the savages already," he complained. "damned 
incompetence!" 

"have a gramme," suggested lenina. 

he refused, preferring his anger. and at last, thank ford, he was 
through and, yes, it was helmholtz; helmholtz, to whom he explained 
what had happened, and who promised to go round at once, at once, 
and turn off the tap, yes, at once, but took this opportunity to tell him 
what the d.h.c. had said, in public, yesterday evening ...

fanny nodded. "and i must say," she said, "i was quite agreeably sur-

the chief bottler, the director of predestination, three deputy assis- 
tant fertilizer-generals, the professor of feelies in the college of emo- 
tional engineering, the dean of the westminster community singery, 



the supervisor of bokanovskification-the list of bernard's notabilities 
was interminable. 

"and i had six girls last week," he confided to helmholtz watson. "one 
on monday, two on tuesday, two more on friday, and one on saturday. 
and if i'd had the time or the inclination, there were at least a dozen 
more who were only too anxious ..." 

helmholtz listened to his boastings in a silence so gloomily disapprov- 
ing that bernard was offended. 

"you're envious," he said. 

helmholtz shook his head. "i'm rather sad, that's all," he answered. 

bernard went off in a huff. never, he told himself, never would he 
speak to helmholtz again.

n handfuls out into the area. 

for a moment the khaki mob was silent, petrified, at the spectacle of 
this wanton sacrilege, with amazement and horror. 

"he's mad," whispered bernard, staring with wide open eyes. "they'll 
kill him. they'll ..." a great shout suddenly went up from the mob; a 
wave of movement drove it menacingly towards the savage. "ford 
help him!" said bernard, and averted his eyes. 

"ford helps those who help themselves." and with a laugh, actually a 
laugh of exultation, helmholtz watson pushed his way through the 
crowd. 

"free, free!" the savage shouted, and with one hand continued to 
throw the soma into the area while, with the other, he punched the in- 
distinguishable faces of his assailants. "free!" and suddenly there was 
helmholtz at his side-"good old helmholtz!"-also punching-"men at 
last!"-and in the interval also throwing the poison out by handfuls 
through the open window. "yes, men! men!" and there was no more 
poison left. he picked up the cash-box and showed

"what happened?" asked helmholtz watson. 

the controller sighed. "very nearly what's going to happen to you 
young men. i was on the point of being sent to an island." 

the words galvanized bernard into violent and unseemly activity. 
"send me to an island?" he jumped up, ran across the room, and 
stood gesticulating in front of the controller. "you can't send me. i 
haven't done anything. it was the others. i swear it was the others." 
he pointed accusingly to helmholtz and the savage. "oh, please don't
