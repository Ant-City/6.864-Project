 he said clearly; jeff bowed as gracefully
as a man could in the fork of a great limb. â€œmr. vandyck jenningsâ€--i
also tried to make an effective salute and nearly lost my balance.

then terry laid his hand upon his chest--a fine chest he had, too,
and introduced himself; he was braced carefully for the occasion and
achieved an excellent obeisance.

again they laughed delightedly, and the one nearest me followed his
tactics.

â€œcelis,â€ she said distinctly, pointing to the one in blue; â€œalimaâ€--the
one in rose; then, with a vivid imitation of terryâ€™s impressive manner,
she laid a firm delicate hand on her gold-green jerkin--â€œellador.â€ this
was pleasant, but we got no nearer.

â€œwe canâ€™t sit here and learn the language,â€ terry protested. he beckoned
to them to come nearer, most winningly--but they gaily shook their
heads. he suggested, by signs, that we all go down together; but again
they shook their heads, still merrily. then ellador clearly indicated
that we should go

far as he could reach toward the girl nearest him. he stood braced
in the fork, held firmly by one hand--the other, swinging his bright
temptation, reached far out along the bough, but not quite to his full
stretch.

she was visibly moved, i noted, hesitated, spoke to her companions.
they chattered softly together, one evidently warning her, the other
encouraging. then, softly and slowly, she drew nearer. this was alima,
a tall long-limbed lass, well-knit and evidently both strong and agile.
her eyes were splendid, wide, fearless, as free from suspicion as a
childâ€™s who has never been rebuked. her interest was more that of
an intent boy playing a fascinating game than of a girl lured by an
ornament.

the others moved a bit farther out, holding firmly, watching. terryâ€™s
smile was irreproachable, but i did not like the look in his eyes--it
was like a creature about to spring. i could already see it happen--t

ir advanced age. theyâ€™re
all grandmas, i tell you--or ought to be. great aunts, anyhow. those
girls were girls all right, werenâ€™t they?â€

â€œyes--â€ jeff agreed, still slowly. â€œbut they werenâ€™t afraid--they flew
up that tree and hid, like schoolboys caught out of bounds--not like shy
girls.â€

â€œand they ran like marathon winners--youâ€™ll admit that, terry,â€ he
added.

terry was moody as the days passed. he seemed to mind our confinement
more than jeff or i did; and he harped on alima, and how near heâ€™d come
to catching her. â€œif i had--â€ he would say, rather savagely, â€œweâ€™d have
had a hostage and could have made terms.â€

but jeff was getting on excellent terms with his tutor, and even his
guards, and so was i. it interested me profoundly to note and study
the subtle difference between these women and other women, and try to
account for them. in the matter of personal appearance, there was a
great difference. they all wore short hair, some few inches at most;

pale sheet of water.

quietly but swiftly we rushed forward and began to tug at the fastenings
of that cover.

â€œconfound the thing!â€ terry cried in desperate impatience. â€œtheyâ€™ve got
it sewed up in a bag! and weâ€™ve not a knife among us!â€

then, as we tugged and pulled at that tough cloth we heard a sound that
made terry lift his head like a war horse--the sound of an unmistakable
giggle, yes--three giggles.

there they were--celis, alima, ellador--looking just as they had when
we first saw them, standing a little way off from us, as interested, as
mischievous as three schoolboys.

â€œhold on, terry--hold on!â€ i warned. â€œthatâ€™s too easy. look out for a
trap.â€

â€œlet us appeal to their kind hearts,â€ jeff urged. â€œi think they will
help us. perhaps theyâ€™ve got knives.â€

â€œitâ€™s no use rushing them, anyhow,â€ i was absolutely holding on to
terry. â€œwe know they can out-run and out-climb us.â€

he reluctantly ad

pockets certain little packages, and with the utmost ease and accuracy
tossed them into our hands.

jeff was most appreciative of this; and terry made extravagant gestures
of admiration, which seemed to set them off, boy-fashion, to show their
skill. while we ate the excellent biscuits they had thrown us, and while
ellador kept a watchful eye on our movements, celis ran off to some
distance, and set up a sort of â€œduck-on-a-rockâ€ arrangement, a big
yellow nut on top of three balanced sticks; alima, meanwhile, gathering
stones.

they urged us to throw at it, and we did, but the thing was a long way
off, and it was only after a number of failures, at which those elvish
damsels laughed delightedly, that jeff succeeded in bringing the whole
structure to the ground. it took me still longer, and terry, to his
intense annoyance, came third.

then celis set up the little tripod again, and looked back at us,
knocking it down, pointing at it, and shaking her short curls severely.

more, all the girls there
were! always excepting our three!--with whom we presently renewed our
acquaintance.

when it came to courtship, which it soon did, i can of course best
describe my own--and am least inclined to. but of jeff i heard somewhat;
he was inclined to dwell reverently and admiringly, at some length,
on the exalted sentiment and measureless perfection of his celis; and
terry--terry made so many false starts and met so many rebuffs, that by
the time he really settled down to win alima, he was considerably wiser.
at that, it was not smooth sailing. they broke and quarreled, over and
over; he would rush off to console himself with some other fair one--the
other fair one would have none of him--and he would drift back to alima,
becoming more and more devoted each time.

she never gave an inch. a big, handsome creature, rather exceptionally
strong even in that race of strong women, with a proud head and sweeping
level brows that lined across above her dark eager eyes like the wi

farmland, and then gardens, gorgeous gardens, and then palaces
full of rare and curious treasures--incalculable, inexhaustible, and
then--mountains--like the himalayas, and then the sea.

i liked her that day she balanced on the branch before me and named the
trio. i thought of her most. afterward i turned to her like a friend
when we met for the third time, and continued the acquaintance. while
jeffâ€™s ultra-devotion rather puzzled celis, really put off their day
of happiness, while terry and alima quarreled and parted, re-met and
re-parted, ellador and i grew to be close friends.

we talked and talked. we took long walks together. she showed me things,
explained them, interpreted much that i had not understood. through her
sympathetic intelligence i became more and more comprehending of the
spirit of the people of herland, more and more appreciative of its
marvelous inner growth as well as outer perfection.

i ceased to feel a stranger, a prisoner. there was a sense of

with its woman-built houses; down at the smooth, hard road
we were walking on; and then at the little basket he had taken from her.

â€œi donâ€™t understand,â€ she said quite sweetly. â€œare the women in your
country so weak that they could not carry such a thing as that?â€

â€œit is a convention,â€ he said. â€œwe assume that motherhood is a
sufficient burden--that men should carry all the others.â€

â€œwhat a beautiful feeling!â€ she said, her blue eyes shining.

â€œdoes it work?â€ asked alima, in her keen, swift way. â€œdo all men in all
countries carry everything? or is it only in yours?â€

â€œdonâ€™t be so literal,â€ terry begged lazily. â€œwhy arenâ€™t you willing to
be worshipped and waited on? we like to do it.â€

â€œyou donâ€™t like to have us do it to you,â€ she answered.

â€œthatâ€™s different,â€ he said, annoyed; and when she said, â€œwhy is it?â€ he
quite sulked, referring her to me, saying, â€œvanâ€™s the philosopher.â€

ellador and i talked it all out together, so

 that we had an easier
experience of it when the real miracle time came. also, between us, we
made things clearer to jeff and celis. but terry would not listen to
reason.

he was madly in love with alima. he wanted to take her by storm, and
nearly lost her forever.

you see, if a man loves a girl who is in the first place young and
inexperienced; who in the second place is educated with a background
of caveman tradition, a middle-ground of poetry and romance, and a
foreground of unspoken hope and interest all centering upon the one
event; and who has, furthermore, absolutely no other hope or interest
worthy of the name--why, it is a comparatively easy matter to sweep
her off her feet with a das

hing attack. terry was a past master in this
process. he tried it here, and alima was so affronted, so repelled, that
it was weeks before he got near enough to try again.

the more coldly she denied him, the hotter his determination; he was
not used to real refusal. the approach of flattery she dismissed with
laughter, gifts and such â€œattentionsâ€ we could not bring to bear, pathos
and complaint of cruelty stirred only a reasoning inquiry. it took terry
a long time.

i doubt if she ever accepted her strange lover as fully as did celis
and ellador theirs. he had hurt and o

ffended her too often; there were
reservations.

but i think alima retained some faint vestige of long-descended feeling
which made terry more possible to her than to others; and that she had
made up her mind to the experiment and hated to renounce it.

however it came about, we all three at length achieved full
understanding, and solemnly faced what was to them a step of measureless
importance, a grave question as well as a great happiness; to us a
strange, new joy.

we should pair off together in our courting days was natural to
them; that we three should remain much together, as they did themselves,
was also natural. we had as yet no work, so we hung about them in their
forest tasks; that was natural, too.

but when we began to talk about each couple having â€œhomesâ€ of our own,
they could not understand it.

â€œour work takes us all around the country,â€ explained celis. â€œwe cannot
live in one place all the time.â€

â€œwe are together now,â€ urged alima, looking proudly at terryâ€™s stalwart
nearness. (this was one of the times when they were â€œon,â€ though
presently â€œoffâ€ again.)

â€œitâ€™s not the same thing at all,â€ he insisted. â€œa man wants a home of
his own, with his wife and family in it.â€

â€œstaying in it? all the time?â€ asked ellador. â€œnot imprisoned, surely!â€

â€œof course not! living there--naturally,â€ he answered.

â€œwhat does she do there--all the time?â€ alima demanded. â€œwhat is her
work?â€

then terry pa

plained again that our women did not work--with
reservations.

â€œbut what do they do--if they have no work?â€ she persisted.

â€œthey take care of the home--and the children.â€

â€œat the same time?â€ asked ellador.

â€œwhy yes. the children play about, and the mother has charge of it all.
there are servants, of course.â€

it seemed so obvious, so natural to terry, that he always grew
impatient; but the girls were honestly anxious to understand.

â€œhow many children do your women have?â€ alima had her notebook out now,
and a rather firm set of lip. terry began to dodge.

â€œthere is no set number, my dear,â€ he explained. â€œsome have more, some
have less.â€

â€œsome have none at all,â€ i put in mischievously.

they pounced on this admission and soon wrung from us the general fact
that those women who had the most children had the least servants, and
those who had the most servants had the least children.

â€œthere!â€ triumphed alima. â€œone or two or no children, and three or fo

itations of a wholly personal life were
inconceivable.

â€œwe cannot really understand it,â€ ellador concluded. â€œwe are only half
a people. we have our woman-ways and they have their man-ways and their
both-ways. we have worked out a system of living which is, of course,
limited. they must have a broader, richer, better one. i should like to
see it.â€

â€œyou shall, dearest,â€ i whispered.


â€œthereâ€™s nothing to smoke,â€ complained terry. he was in the midst of a
prolonged quarrel with alima, and needed a sedative. â€œthereâ€™s nothing to
drink. these blessed women have no pleasant vices. i wish we could get
out of here!â€

this wish was vain. we were always under a certain degree of
watchfulness. when terry burst forth to tramp the streets at night he
always found a â€œcolonelâ€ here or there; and when, on an occasion of
fierce though temporary despair, he had plunged to the cliff edge with
some vague view to escape, he found several of them close by. we were
free--but there was

 were all very close together; and instead of developing
them in detached lines, they had kept the connection. let me try again
to give, if i can, a faint sense of the difference in the life view--the
background and basis on which their culture rested.

ellador told me a lot about it. she took me to see the children, the
growing girls, the special teachers. she picked out books for me to
read. she always seemed to understand just what i wanted to know, and
how to give it to me.

while terry and alima struck sparks and parted--he always madly drawn
to her and she to him--she must have been, or sheâ€™d never have stood the
way he behaved--ellador and i had already a deep, restful feeling, as
if weâ€™d always had one another. jeff and celis were happy; there was no
question of that; but it didnâ€™t seem to me as if they had the good times
we did.

well, here is the herland child facing life--as ellador tried to show
it to me. from the first memory, they knew peace, beauty, order, safety,

least we can do for them.â€

it was. there was so little, after all, that we could do for them. here
we were, penniless guests and strangers, with no chance even to use
our strength and courage--nothing to defend them from or protect them
against.

â€œwe can at least give them our names,â€ jeff insisted.

they were very sweet about it, quite willing to do whatever we asked, to
please us. as to the names, alima, frank soul that she was, asked what
good it would do.

terry, always irritating her, said it was a sign of possession. â€œyou are
going to be mrs. nicholson,â€ he said. â€œmrs. t. o. nicholson. that shows
everyone that you are my wife.â€

â€œwhat is a â€˜wifeâ€™ exactly?â€ she demanded, a dangerous gleam in her eye.

â€œa wife is the woman who belongs to a man,â€ he began.

but jeff took it up eagerly: â€œand a husband is the man who belongs to
a woman. it is because we are monogamous, you

ivil and religious, that joins the two together--â€˜until death
do us part,â€™â€ he finished, looking at celis with unutterable devotion.

â€œwhat makes us all feel foolish,â€ i told the girls, â€œis that here we
have nothing to give you--except, of course, our names.â€

â€œdo your women have no names before they are married?â€ celis suddenly
demanded.

â€œwhy, yes,â€ jeff explained. â€œthey have their maiden names--their
fatherâ€™s names, that is.â€

â€œand what becomes of them?â€ asked alima.

â€œthey change them for their husbandsâ€™, my dear,â€ terry answered her.

â€œchange them? do the husbands then take the wivesâ€™ â€˜maiden namesâ€™?â€

â€œoh, no,â€ he laughed. â€œthe man keeps his own and gives it to her, too.â€

â€œthen she just loses hers and takes a new one--how unpleasant! we wonâ€™t
do that!â€ alima said decidedly.

terry was good-humored about it. â€œi donâ€™t care what you do or donâ€™t do
so long as we have that wedding pretty soon,â€ he said, reaching a stron

brown hand after alimaâ€™s, quite as brown and nearly as strong.

â€œas to giving us things--of course we can see that youâ€™d like to, but
we are glad you canâ€™t,â€ celis continued. â€œyou see, we love you just for
yourselves--we wouldnâ€™t want you to--to pay anything. isnâ€™t it enough to
know that you are loved personally--and just as men?â€

enough or not, that was the way we were married. we had a great triple
wedding in the biggest temple of all, and it looked as if most of the
nation was present. it was ve

ry beautiful. someone had
written a new song for the occasion, nobly beautiful, about the new hope
for their people--the new tie with other lands--brotherhood as well as
sisterhood, and, with evident awe, fatherhood.

terry was always restive under their talk of fatherhood. â€œanybodyâ€™d
think we were high priests of--of philoprogenitiveness!â€ he protested.
â€œthese women think of nothing but children, seems to me! weâ€™ll teach
â€˜em!â€

he was so certain of what he was going to teach, and alima so uncertain
in her moods of reception, that jeff and i feared the worst. we tried to
caution him--much good that did. the big handsome fellow drew himself up
to his full height, lifted that great chest of his, and laughed.

â€œthere are three separate marriages,â€ he said. â€œi wonâ€™t interfere with
yours--nor you with mine.â€

so the great day came, and the countless crowds of women, and we three
bridegrooms without any supporting â€œbest men,â€ or any other men to back
us up, felt strang

o was correct. they had their long, wide, deep, rich experience
of motherhood, and their only perception of the value of a male creature
as such was for fatherhood.

aside from that, of course, was the whole range of personal love, love
which as jeff earnestly phrased it â€œpasseth the love of women!â€ it did,
too. i can give no idea--either now, after long and happy experience of
it, or as it seemed then, in the first measureless wonder--of the beauty
and power of the love they gave us.

even alima--who had a more stormy temperament than either of the others,
and who, heaven knows, had far more provocation--even alima was patience
and tenderness and wisdom personified to the man she loved, until
he--but i havenâ€™t got to that yet.


these, as terry put it, â€œalleged or so-called wivesâ€ of ours, went right
on with their profession as foresters. we, having no special learnings,
had long since qualified as assistants. we had to do something, if only
to pass the time, and it had to be wor

ever anybody worked to woo and win and hold a human soul,
she did, great superwoman that she was. i couldnâ€™t then half comprehend
the skill of it, the wonder. but this i soon began to find: that under
all our cultivated attitude of mind toward women, there is an older,
deeper, more â€œnaturalâ€ feeling, the restful reverence which looks up to
the mother sex.

so we grew together in friendship and happiness, ellador and i, and so
did jeff and celis.

when it comes to terryâ€™s part of it, and alimaâ€™s, iâ€™m sorry--and
iâ€™m ashamed. of course i blame her somewhat. she wasnâ€™t as fine
a psychologist as ellador, and whatâ€™s more, i think she had a
far-descended atavistic trace of more marked femaleness, never apparent
till terry called it out. but when all is said, it doesnâ€™t excuse him. i
hadnâ€™t realized to the full terryâ€™s character--i couldnâ€™t, being a man.

the position was the same as with us, of course, only with these
distinctions. alima, a shade more alluring, and severa

and

    the things that i learned from the yellow and black,
    they â€˜ave helped me a â€˜eap with the white.

jeff turned sharply and left him at the time. i was a bit disquieted
myself.

poor old terry! the things heâ€™d learned didnâ€™t help him a heap in
herland. his idea was to take--he thought that was the way. he thought,
he honestly believed, that women like it. not the women of herland! not
alima!

i can see her now--one day in the very first week of their marriage,
setting forth to her dayâ€™s work with long determined strides and
hard-set mouth, and sticking close to ellador. she didnâ€™t wish to be
alone with terry--you could see that.

but the more she kept away from him, the more he wanted her--naturally.

he made a tremendous row about their separate establishments, tried to
keep her in his rooms, tried to stay in hers. but there she drew the
line sharply.

he came away one night,

 and stamped up and down the moonlit road,
swearing under his breath. i was taking a walk that night too, but i
wasnâ€™t in his state of mind. to hear him rage youâ€™d not have believed
that he loved alima at all--youâ€™d have thought that she was some quarry
he was pursuing, something to catch and conquer.

i think that, owing to all those differences i spoke of, they soon lost
the common ground they had at first, and were unable to meet sanely
and dispassionately. i fancy too--this is pure conjecture--that he
had succeeded in driving alima beyond her best judgment, her real
conscience, and that after that her own sense of shame, the reaction of
the thing, made her bitter perhaps.

r. also, she had a sturdy
assistant detailed to accompany her in her work.

terry had his own ideas, as iâ€™ve tried to show. i daresay he thought he
had a right to do as he did. perhaps he even convinced himself that
it would be better for her. anyhow, he hid himself in her bedroom one
night...

the women of herland have no fear of men. why should they have? they
are not timid in any sense. they are not weak; and they all have strong
trained athletic bodies. othello could not have extinguished alima with
a pillow, as if she were a mouse.

terry put in practice his pet conviction that a woman loves to be
mastered, and by sheer brute force, in all the pride and passion of his
intense masculinity, he tried to master this woman.

it did not work. i got a pretty clear account of it later from ellador,
but what we heard at the time was the noise of a tremendous struggle,
and alima calling to moadine. moadine was close by and came at once; one
or two more strong grave women followed.

d about like a madman; he would cheerfully have killed
them--he told me that, himself--but he couldnâ€™t. when he swung a chair
over his head one sprang in the air and caught it, two threw themselves
bodily upon him and forced him to the floor; it was only the work of a
few moments to have him tied hand and foot, and then, in sheer pity for
his futile rage, to anesthetize him.

alima was in a cold fury. she wanted him killed--actually.

there was a trial before the local over mother, and this woman, who did
not enjoy being mastered, stated her case.

in a court in our country he would have been held quite â€œwithin his
rights,â€ of course. but this was not our country; it was theirs. they
seemed to measure the enormity of the offense by its effect upon a
possible fatherhood, and he scorned even to reply to this way of putting
it.

said that my head could not be cut off?â€ a difficult person, epictetus.

what is this miracle by which a woman, even in your arms, may withdraw
herself, utterly disappear till what you hold is as inaccessible as the
face of a cliff?

â€œbe patient with me, dear,â€ she urged sweetly. â€œi know it is hard for
you. and i begin to see--a little--how terry was so driven to crime.â€

â€œoh, come, thatâ€™s a pretty hard word for it. after all, alima was
his wife, you know,â€ i urged, feeling at the moment a sudden burst of
sympathy for poor terry. for a man of his temperament--and habits--it
must have been an unbearable situation.

but ellador, for all her wide intellectual grasp, and the broad sympathy
in which their religion trained them, could not make allowance for
such--to her--sacrilegious brutality.

it was the more difficult to explain to her, because we three, in our
constant talks and lectures about the rest of the world, had na

™d have liked to wait
for that marvel of celisâ€™s, but terry had no such desire. he was crazy
to be out of it all. it made him sick, he said, sick; this everlasting
mother-mother-mothering. i donâ€™t think terry had what the phrenologists
call â€œthe lump of philoprogenitivenessâ€ at all well developed.

â€œmorbid one-sided cripples,â€ he called them, even when from his window
he could see their splendid vigor and beauty; even while moadine, as
patient and friendly as if she had never helped alima to hold and bind
him, sat there in the room, the picture of wisdom and serene strength.
â€œsexless, epicene, undeveloped neuters!â€ he went on bitterly. he sounded
like sir almwroth wright.

well--it was hard. he was madly in love with alima, really; more so than
he had ever been before, and their tempestuous courtship, quarrels, and
reconciliations had fanned the flame. and then when he sought by that
supreme conquest which seems so natural a thing to that type of man, to
force her to love hi

afterward. there was that adventure of â€œfalse sextus,â€ for instance,
who â€œfound lucrese combing the fleece, under the midnight lamp.â€ he
threatened, as i remember, that if she did not submit he would slay her,
slay a slave and place him beside her and say he found him there. a poor
device, it always seemed to me. if mr. lucretius had asked him how he
came to be in his wifeâ€™s bedroom overlooking her morals, what could he
have said? but the point is lucrese submitted, and alima didnâ€™t.

â€œshe kicked me,â€ confided the embittered prisoner--he had to talk to
someone. â€œi was doubled up with the pain, of course, and she jumped on
me and yelled for this old harpy [moadine couldnâ€™t hear him] and they
had me trussed up in no time. i believe alima could have done it alone,â€
 he added with reluctant admiration. â€œsheâ€™s as strong as a horse. and
of course a manâ€™s helpless when you hit him like that. no woman with a
shade of decency--â€

i had to grin at that, an
