toward noon the mckiscos, mrs. abrams, mr. dumphry,
and signor campion came on the beach. they had brought
a new umbrella that they set up with side glances toward
the divers, and crept under with satisfied expressionsâ€”all
save mr. mckisco, who remained derisively without. in his
raking dick had passed near them and now he returned to
the umbrellas.
â€˜the two young men are reading the book of etiquette
together,â€™ he said in a low voice.
â€˜planning to mix wit de quality,â€™ said abe.
mary north, the very tanned young woman whom rosemary
had encountered the first day on the raft, came in from
swimming and said with a smile that was a rakish gleam:
â€˜so mr. and mrs. neverquiver have arrived.â€™
â€˜theyâ€™re this manâ€™s friends,â€™ nicole reminded her, indicating
abe. â€˜why doesnâ€™t he go and speak to them? donâ€™t
you think theyâ€™re attractive?â€™
â€˜i think theyâ€™re very attractive,â€™ abe agreed. â€˜i just donâ€™t
think theyâ€™re attractive, thatâ€™s all.â€™
â€˜well, i have felt

â€˜so since things are over down hereâ€”â€˜

courteous and all that. then they grew tired of it and they
were funny and bitter, and finally they made a lot of plans.
they laughed at things that they would not remember clearly
afterwardâ€”laughed a lot and the men drank three bottles
of wine. the trio of women at the table were representative
of the enormous flux of american life. nicole was the
granddaughter of a self-made american capitalist and the
granddaughter of a count of the house of lippe weissenfeld.
mary north was the daughter of a journeyman paper-hanger
and a descendant of president tyler. rosemary was from
the middle of the middle class, catapulted by her mother
onto the uncharted heights of hollywood. their point of resemblance
to each other and their difference from so many
american women, lay in the fact that they were all happy to
exist in a manâ€™s worldâ€”they preserved their individuality
through men and not by opposition to them. they would
all three have made alternatively good courtesans

it was good to be hard, then; all nice people were hard
on themselves. but it was four oâ€™clock and rosemary kept
thinking of dick waiting for nicole now at the hotel. she
must go there, she must not make him wait for her. she kept
thinking, â€˜why donâ€™t you go?â€™ and then suddenly, â€˜or let me
go if you donâ€™t want to.â€™ but nicole went to one more place
to buy corsages for them both and sent one to mary north.
only then she seemed to remember and with sudden abstraction
she signalled for a taxi.
â€˜good-by,â€™ said nicole. â€˜we had fun, didnâ€™t we?â€™
â€˜loads of fun,â€™ said rosemary. it was more difficult than
she thought and her whole self protested as nicole drove
away.

â€˜iâ€™ll try and persuade him,â€™ offered rosemary.
â€˜would you?â€™ mary said doubtfully. â€˜maybe you could.â€™
then dick came up to rosemary:
â€˜nicole and i are going home and we thought youâ€™d want 
118 tender is the night

her face was pale with fatigue in the false dawn. two
wan dark spots in her cheek marked where the color was
by day.
â€˜i canâ€™t,â€™ she said. â€˜i promised mary north to stay along
with themâ€”or abeâ€™ll never go to bed. maybe you could do
something.â€™
â€˜donâ€™t you know you canâ€™t do anything about people?â€™ he
advised her. â€˜if abe was my room-mate in college, tight for
the first time, itâ€™d be different. now thereâ€™s nothing to do.â€™

abe recovered from a cigarette cough and remarked:
â€˜trouble is when youâ€™re sober you donâ€™t want to see anybody,
and when youâ€™re tight nobody wants to see you.â€™
â€˜who, me?â€™ nicole laughed again; for some reason the
late encounter had cheered her.
â€˜noâ€”me.â€™

rosemary and mary north came in sight, walking slowly
and searching for abe, and nicole burst forth grossly
with â€˜hey! hi! hey!â€™ and laughed and waved the package of
handkerchiefs she had bought for abe.
they stood in an uncomfortable little group weighted
down by abeâ€™s gigantic presence: he lay athwart them like
the wreck of a galleon, dominating with his presence his
own weakness and self-indulgence, his narrowness and bitterness.
all of them were conscious of the solemn dignity

doors, across from the luxembourg
gardens, rosemary had cramps and felt fretful and
full of impatient lassitudeâ€”it was the foretaste of this that
had inspired her self-accusation of selfishness in the station.
dick had no suspicion of the sharpness of the change;
he was profoundly unhappy and the subsequent increase of
egotism tended momentarily to blind him to what was going
on round about him, and deprive him of the long groundswell
of imagination that he counted on for his judgments.
after mary north left them, accompanied by the italian
singing teacher who had joined them for coffee and was taking
her to her train, rosemary, too, stood up, bound for an
engagement at her studio: â€˜meet some officials.â€™
â€˜and ohâ€”â€˜ she proposed â€˜â€”if collis clay, that southern
boyâ€”if he comes while you are still sitting here, just tell
him i couldnâ€™t wait; tell him to call me to-morrow.â€™

rosemary got it, took it without resentment.
â€˜iâ€™ll let it go then. good-by, you darlings.â€™
dick asked for the check; the divers relaxed, chewing
tentatively on toothpicks.
â€˜wellâ€”â€˜ they said together.
he saw a flash of unhappiness on her mouth, so brief that
only he would have noticed, and he could pretend not to
have seen. what did nicole think? rosemary was one of a
dozen people he had â€˜worked overâ€™ in the past years: these
had included a french circus clown, abe and mary north,
a pair of dancers, a writer, a painter, a comedienne from
the grand guignol, a half-crazy pederast from the russian
ballet, a promising tenor they had staked to a year in milan.
nicole well knew how seriously these people interpreted his
interest and enthusiasm; but she realized also that, except
while their children were being born, dick had not spent
a night apart from her since their marriage. on the other
hand, there was a pleasingness about him that simply had
to be usedâ€”those who posse

it was equivalent to the system of a regimental supply

thousand men.
the divers flocked from the train into the early gathered
twilight of the valley. the village people watched the
debarkation with an awe akin to that which followed the
italian pilgrimages of lord byron a century before. their
hostess was the contessa di minghetti, lately mary north.
the journey that had begun in a room over the shop of a
paperhanger in newark had ended in an extraordinary

â€˜conte di minghettiâ€™ was merely a papal titleâ€”the wealth
of maryâ€™s husband flowed from his being ruler-owner of
manganese deposits in southwestern asia. he was not quite
light enough to travel in a pullman south of mason-dixon;
he was of the kyble-berber-sabaeanhindu strain that belts

making her jump with the gesture.
to mary as well as to the divers the greeting was faintly
comic; mary gave an apologetic, belittling giggle; yet her
voice, as she introduced her husband by his asiatic title,
flew proud and high.
in their rooms as they dressed for dinner, dick and nicole
grimaced at each other in an awed way: such rich as
want to be thought democratic pretend in private to be
swept off their feet by swank.
â€˜little mary north knows what she wants,â€™ dick muttered
through his shaving cream. â€˜abe educated her, and
now sheâ€™s married to a buddha. if europe ever goes bolshevik
sheâ€™ll turn up as the bride of stalin.â€™
nicole looked around from her dressing-case. â€˜watch

â€˜it is true,â€™ dick answered, sitting down with them. â€˜the

jealous about itâ€”think of mrs. abramâ€™s long climb up the
back stairs of the ritz on her hands and knees and all the
carpet dust she had to inhale.â€™
rosemary interrupted him. â€˜but is that really mary
north?â€™ she was regarding a woman sauntering in their direction
followed by a small group who behaved as if they
were accustomed to being looked at. when they were ten
feet away, maryâ€™s glance flickered fractionally over the divers,
one of those unfortunate glances

 he had departed wondering
what offense they could have committed; then she slept. a
little after three when dick came in she sat up stark awake
saying, â€˜what?â€™ as if to a character in her dream.
â€˜it was an extraordinary storyâ€”â€˜ dick said. he sat on the
foot of her bed, telling her how he had roused old gausse
from an alsatian coma, told him to clean out his cash drawer,
and driven with him to the police station.
â€˜i donâ€™t like to do something for that anglaise,â€™ gausse
grumbled.
mary north and lady caroline, dressed in the costume
of french sailors, lounged on a bench outside the two dingy
cells. the latter had the outraged air of a briton who momentarily
expected the mediterranean fleet to steam up to

he had seen them though, as they left their pavilion, and
he followed them with his eyes until they disappeared again.
he sat with mary minghetti, drinking anisette.
â€˜you were like you used to be the night you helped us,â€™
she was saying, â€˜except at the end, when you were horrid
about caroline. why arenâ€™t you nice like that always? you
can be.â€™
it seemed fantastic to dick to be in a position where
mary north could tell him about things.
â€˜your friends still like you, dick. but you say awful things
to people when youâ€™ve been drinking. iâ€™ve spent most of my
time defending you this summer.â€™
