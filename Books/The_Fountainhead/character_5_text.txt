"how old are you?" asked the dean.

"twenty-two," said roark.

"quite excusable," said the dean; he seemed relieved. "you'll outgrow all that." he smiled. 
"the old standards have lived for thousands of years and nobody has been able to improve 
upon them. what are your modernists? a transient mode, exhibitionists trying to attract 
attention. have you observed the course of their careers? can you name one who has 
achieved any permanent distinction? look at henry cameron. a great man, a leading 
architect twenty years ago. what is he today? lucky if he gets--once a year--a garage to

it's funny, thought keating, he had not remembered that youthful ambition of his for years. it's 
funny that it should hurt him now--to remember. well, this was the night to remember it--and 
to forget it forever.

architects, he thought, always made brilliant careers. and once on top, did they ever fail? 
suddenly, he recalled henry cameron; builder of skyscrapers twenty years ago; old drunkard 
with offices on some waterfront today. keating shuddered and walked faster.

he wondered, as he walked, whether people were looking at him. he watched the rectangles 
of lighted windows; when a curtain fluttered and a head leaned out, he tried to guess whether 
it had leaned to watch his passing; if it hadn't, some day it would; some day, they all would.

of the dana building said that they would not exchange it for any structure on earth; they 
appreciated the light, the air, the beautiful logic of the plan in their halls and offices. but the 
tenants of the dana building were not numerous; no prominent man wished his business to be

located in a building that looked "like a warehouse."

the dana building had been designed by henry cameron.

in the eighteen-eighties, the architects of new york fought one another for second place in 
their profession. no one aspired to the first. the first was held by henry cameron. henry 
cameron was hard to get in those days. he had a waiting list two years in advance; he 
designed personally every structure that left his office. he chose what he wished to build. 
when he built, a client kept his mouth shut. he demanded of all people the one thing he had 
never granted anybody: obedience. he wen

startling experiments, once in a while, but people expected it and one did not argue with henry 
cameron. something was growing in him with each new building, struggling, taking shape, 
rising dangerously to an explosion. the explosion came with the birth of the skyscraper. when

this new miracle and to give it form. he was among the first and the few who accepted the 
truth that a tall building must look tall. while architects cursed, wondering how to make a 
twenty-story building look like an old brick mansion, while they used every horizontal device 
available in order to cheat it of its height, shrink it down to tradition, hide the shame of its steel, 
make it small, safe and ancient--henry cameron designed skyscrapers in straight, vertical 
lines, flaunting their steel and height. while architects drew friezes and pediments, henry 
cameron decided that the skyscraper must not copy the greeks. henry cameron decided that 
no building must copy any other.

he was thirty-nine years old then, short, stocky, unkempt; he worked like a dog, missed his

ones. it was white as a plague, and it spread as such.

people came, looked, were astounded, and carried away with them, to the cities of america, 
the seeds of what they had seen. the seeds sprouted into weeds; into shingled post offices 
with doric porticos, brick mansions with iron pediments, lofts made of twelve parthenons piled 
on top of one another. the weeds grew and choked everything else.

henry cameron had refused to work for the columbian exposition, and had called it names 
that were unprintable, but repeatable, though not in mixed company. they were repeated. it 
was repeated also that he had thrown an inkstand at the face of a distinguished banker who 
had asked him to design a railroad station in the shape of the temple of diana at ephesus. 
the banker never came back. there were others who never came back.

it was not necessary to design buildings any longer, only to photograph them; the architect 
with the best library was the best architect imitators copied imitations. to sanction it there was 
culture; there were twenty centuries unrolling in moldering ruins; there was the great 
exposition; there was every european post card in every family album.

henry cameron had nothing to offer against this; nothing but a faith he held merely because it 
was his own. he had nobody to quote and nothing of importance to say. he said only that the 
form of a building must follow its function; that the structure of a building is the key to its 
beauty; that new methods of construction demand new forms; that he wished to build as he 
wished and for that reason only. but people could not listen to him when they were discussing

he lived to sit at the desk in his empty office, motionless, idle, waiting. he lived to read in a 
well-meaning newspaper account a reference to "the late henry cameron." he lived to begin 
drinking, quietly, steadily, terribly, for days and nights at a time; and to hear those who had 
driven him to it say, when his name was mentioned for a commission: "cameron? i should say 
not. he drinks like a fish. that's why he never gets any work." he lived to move from the

howard roark looked at the dana building beyond the windows, stopping at each landing, as 
he mounted the six flights of stairs to henry cameron's office; the elevator was out of order. 
the stairs had been painted a dirty file-green a long time ago; a little of the paint remained to 
grate under shoe soles in crumbling patches. roark went up swiftly, as if he had an 
appointment, a folder of his drawings under his arm, his eyes on the dana building. he 
collided once with a man descending the stairs; this had happened to him often in the last two 
days; he had walked through the streets of the city, his head thrown back, noticing nothi

time. he rose at last, without a word, shuffled to a door behind him and went in.

he left the door half open. roark heard him drawling:

"mr. cameron, there's a fellow outside says he's looking for a job here."

then a voice answered, a strong, clear voice that held no tones of age:

"why, the damn fool! throw him out...wait! send him in!"

the old man returned, held the door open and jerked his head at it silently. roark went in. the 
door closed behind him.

henry cameron sat at his desk at the end of a long, bare room. he sat bent forward, his 
forearms on the desk, his two hands closed before him. his hair and his beard were coal 
black, with coarse threads of white. the muscles of his short, thick neck bulged like ropes. he 
wore a white shirt with the sleeves rolled above the elbows; the bare arms were hard, heavy 
and brown. the flesh of his broad face was rigid, as if it had aged by compression. the eyes 
were dark, young, living.

"i'm just beginning."

"what have you done?"

"i've had three years at stanton."

"oh? the gentleman was too lazy to finish?"

"i have been expelled."

"great!" cameron slapped the desk with his fist and laughed. "splendid! you're not good 
enough for the lice nest at stanton, but you'll work for henry cameron! you've decided this is 
the place for refuse! what did they kick you out for? drink? women? what?"

"these," said roark, and extended his drawings. cameron looked at the first one, then at the 
next, then at every one of them to the bottom. roark heard the paper rustling as cameron 
slipped one sheet behind another. then cameron raised his head. "sit down."

roark obeyed. cameron stared at him, his thick fingers drumming against the pile of 
drawings.

"so you think they're good?' said cameron

he left her two hours later, and he walked away feeling light, clean, happy, his fears forgotten, 
toohey and francon forgotten. he thought only that he had promised to come again tomorrow 
and that it was an unbearably long time to wait. she stood at the door, after he had gone, her 
hand on the knob he had touched, and she thought that he might come tomorrow--or three 
months later.

"when you finish tonight," said henry cameron, "i want to see you in my office."

"yes," said roark.

cameron veered sharply on his heels and walked out of the drafting room. it had been the 
longest sentence he had addressed to roark in a month.

roark had come to this room every morning, had done his task, and had heard no word of 
comment. cameron would enter the drafting room and stand behind roark for a long time, 
looking over his shoulder. it was as if his eyes concentrated deliberately on trying to throw the 
steady hand off its co

s one could soon hear it said: "architecture? oh, yes, ellsworth toohey."

according to his principles, ellsworth m. toohey listed no architect by name in the text of his 
book--"the myth-building, hero-worshipping method of historical research has always been 
obnoxious to me." the names appeared only in footnotes. several of these referred to guy 
francon, "who has a tendency to the overornate, but must be commended for his loyalty to 
the strict tradition of classicism." one note referred to henry cameron, "prominent once as 
one of the fathers of the so-called modern school of architecture and relegated since to a well-
deserved oblivion. vox populi vox dei."

in february of 1925 henry cameron retired from practice.

for a year, he had known that the day would come. he had not spoken of it to roark, but they 
both knew and went on, expecting nothing save to go on as long as it was still possible. a few 
commissions had dribbled into their office in the past year, country cottages, garages,

blueprints with the thin white lines that were girders still standing somewhere; there were 
contracts with famous signatures; and at times, from out of the red glow, there flashed a sum 
of seven figures written on yellowed paper, flashed and went down, in a thin burst of sparks.

from among the letters in an old folder, a newspaper clipping fluttered to the floor. roark 
picked it up. it was dry, brittle and yellow, and it broke at the folds, in his fingers. it was an 
interview given by henry cameron, dated may 7, 1892. it said: "architecture is not a business, 
not a career, but a crusade and a consecration to a joy that justifies the existence of the 
earth." he dropped the clipping into the fire and reached for another folder.

he gathered every stub of pencil from cameron's desk and threw them in also.

he stood over the heater. he did not move, he did not look down; he felt the movement of the

her hat had slipped to one side, her lips were half open, her eyes round, helpless, her lashes 
glistening. he held her hand, palm up, and looked at it: she wore a black woolen glove and her 
fingers were spread out clumsily like a child's; he saw beads of melted snow in the fuzz of the 
glove; they sparkled radiantly once in the light of a car flashing past.

7.

the bulletin of the architects' guild of america carried, in its miscellaneous department, a 
short item announcing henry cameron's retirement. six lines summarized his achievements 
in architecture and misspelled the names of his two best buildings.

peter keating walked into francon's office and interrupted francon's well-bred bargaining with 
an antique dealer over a snuffbox that had belonged to madame pompadour. francon was 
precipitated into paying nine dollars and twenty-five cents more than he had intended to pay. 
he turned to keating testily, after the dealer had left, and asked:

track devotions. he was a master in his own field and he felt no sympathy except for mastery. 
his view of the world was simple: there were the able and there were the incompetent; he was 
not concerned with the latter. he loved buildings. he despised, however, all architects.

"there was one, red," he said earnestly, over his fifth beer, "one only and you'd be too young 
to know about him, but that was the only man that knew building. i worked for him when i was 
your age."

"who was that?"

"henry cameron was his name. he's dead, i guess, these many years."

roark looked at him for a long time, then said: "he's not dead, mike," and added: "i've worked 
for him."

"you did?"

"for almost three years."

they looked at each other silently, and that was the final seal on their friendship.

weeks later, mike stopped roark, one day, at the building, his ugly face puzzled, and asked:

francon's voice cut itself off.

"mr. francon, please let me design it the way the dana building was designed."

"huh?"

"let me do it. not copy the dana building, but design it as henry cameron would have wanted 
it done, as i will."

"you mean modernistic?"

"i...well, call it that." 

"are you crazy?"

"mr. francon, please listen to me." roark's words were like the steps of a man walking a 
tightwire, slow, strained, groping for the only right spot, quivering over an abyss, but precise. "i 
don't blame you for the things you're doing. i'm working for you, i'm taking your money, i have

"i won't join anything, peter, at any time."

"but don't you realize how it helps?"

"in being an architect."

"i don't like to be helped in being an architect."

"you're just making things harder for yourself."

"i am."

"and it will be plenty hard, you know."

"i know."

"you'll make enemies of them if you refuse such an invitation."

"i'll make enemies of them anyway."

the first person to whom roark had told the news was henry cameron. roark went to new 
jersey the day after he signed the contract with heller. it had rained and he found cameron in 
the garden, shuffling slowly down the damp paths, leaning heavily on a cane. in the past 
winter, cameron had improved enough to walk a few hours each day. he walked with effort, 
his body bent.

he looked at the first shoots of green on the earth under his feet. he lifted his cane, once in a 
while, bracing his legs to stand firm for a moment; with the tip of the cane, he touched

and stopped, and gone in, and asked a few questions. after that, he bribed heller's cook to

#

late in may, when the drafting table in roark's office was buried deep in sketches for the 
fargo store, he received another commission.

mr. whitford sanborn, the client, owned an office building that had been built for him many 
years ago by henry cameron. when mr. sanborn decided that he needed a new country 
residence he rejected his wife's suggestions of other architects; he wrote to henry cameron. 
cameron wrote a ten-page letter in answer; the first three lines of the letter stated that he had 
retired from practice; the rest of it was about howard roark. roark never learned what had 
been said in that letter; sanborn would not show it to him and cameron would not tell him. but 
sanborn signed him to build the country residence, in spite of

richard sanborn. weidler told him: "i've had a stiff fight, mr. roark, but i think i've won. i've

however, the board must see the drawings before they make a decision. so it's not quite 
certain as yet, i must tell you frankly, but it's almost certain. they've turned down two other 
architects. they're very much interested in you. go ahead. good luck!"

henry cameron had had a relapse and the doctor warned his sister that no recovery could be 
expected. she did not believe it. she felt a new hope, because she saw that cameron, lying 
still in bed, looked serene and--almost happy, a word she had never found it possible to 
associate with her brother.

but she was frightened, one evening, when he said suddenly: "call howard. ask him to come 
here." in the three years since his retirement he had never called for roark, he had merely 
waited for roark's visits.

ellsworth toohey came out in support of the cause of modern architecture.

in the past ten years, while most of the new residences continued to be built as faithful 
historical copies, the principles of henry cameron had won the field of commercial structures: 
the factories, the office buildings, the skyscrapers. it was a pale, distorted victory; a reluctant 
compromise that consisted of omitting columns and pediments, allowing a few stretches of 
wall to remain naked, apologizing for a shape--good through accident--by finishing it off with 
an edge of simplified grecian volutes. many stole cameron's forms; few understood his 
thinking. the sole part of his argument irresistible to the owners of new struct

. such caution is requisite in anyone who stands in the position of mentor 
to the public taste. too often, isolated manifestations of anomaly can be mistaken for a broad 
popular movement, and one should be careful not to ascribe to them a significance they do 
not deserve. but modern architecture has stood the test of time, has answered a demand of 
the masses, and we are glad to salute it.

"it is not amiss to offer a measure of recognition to the pioneers of this movement, such as 
the late henry cameron. premonitory echoes of the new grandeur can be found in some of 
his work. but like all pioneers he was still bound by the inherited prejudices of the past, by the 
sentimentality of the middle class from which he came. he succumbed to the superstition of 
beauty and ornament, even though the ornament was of his own devising, and, consequently, 
inferior to that of established historical forms.

"it remained for the power of a broad, collective movement to bring modern architecture to its

saw the inscription: "howard roark, architect," on his new door, he stopped for a moment; 
then he walked into the office. his own room, at the end of a long suite, had three walls of 
glass, high over the city. he stopped in the middle of the room. through the broad panes, he 
could see the fargo store, the enright house, the aquitania hotel. he walked to the windows 
facing south and stood there for a long time. at the tip of manhattan, far in the distance, he 
could see the dana building by henry cameron.

on an afternoon of november, returning to his office after a visit to the site of a house under 
construction on long island, roark entered the reception room, shaking his drenched 
raincoat, and saw a look of suppressed excitement on the face of his secretary; she had been 
waiting impatiently for his return.

"mr. roark, this is probably something very big," she said. "i made an appointment for you for 
three o'clock tomorrow afternoon. at his office."

"whose office?"

"he telephoned half

he handed to roark six of his canvases.

roark looked at them, one after another. he took a longer time than he needed. when he 
could trust himself to lift his eyes, he shook his head in silent answer to the word keating had 
not pronounced.

"it's too late, peter," he said gently.

keating nodded. "guess i...knew that."

when keating had gone, roark leaned against the door, closing his eyes. he was sick with 
pity.

he had never felt this before--not when henry cameron collapsed in the office at his feet, not 
when he saw steven mallory sobbing on a bed before him. those moments had been clean. 
but this was pity--this complete awareness of a man without worth or hope, this sense of 
finality, of the not to be redeemed. there was shame in this feeling--his own shame that he 
should have to pronounce such judgment upon a man, that he should know an emotion which 
contained no shred of respect.

this is pity, he thought, and then he lifted his head in wonder. h
