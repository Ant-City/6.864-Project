[CHARACTER] - 
 a wealthy greek count and a veteran of seven wars
and four revolutions. [CHARACTER] becomes infatuated with
brett, but, unlike most of brett's lovers, he does not subject her
to jealous, controlling behavior. amid the careless, amoral pleasure-seeking
crowd that constitutes jake's social circle, the count stands out
as a stable, sane person. like pedro romero, he serves as a foil
for jake and his friends.
