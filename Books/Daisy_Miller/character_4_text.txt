o will tell you all about me,” he said, smiling and referring to his aunt.
“oh, well, we’ll go some day,” said miss miller. and she gave him a smile and turned away. she put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside eugenio. winterbourne stood looking after her; and as she moved away, drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel, said to himself that she had the tournure of a princess.
he had, however, engaged to do more than proved feasible, in promising to present his aunt, mrs. costello, to miss daisy miller. as soon as the former lady had got better of her headache, he waited upon her in her apartment; and, after the proper inquiries in regard to her health, he asked her if she had observed in the hotel an american family—a mamma, a daughter, and a little boy.
“and a courier?” said mrs. costello. “oh yes, i have observed them. seen them—heard them—and kept out of their way.” mrs. costello was a widow with a fortune; a person of much distinction, who frequently i

d. she had two sons married in new york and another who was now in europe. this young man was amusing himself at hamburg, and, though he was on his travels, was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment selected by his mother for her own appearance there. her nephew, who had come up to vevey expressly to see her, was therefore more attentive than those who, as she said, were nearer to her. he had imbibed at geneva the idea that one must always be attentive to one’s aunt. mrs. costello had not seen him for many years, and she was greatly pleased with him, manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of that social sway which, as she gave him to understand, she exerted in the american capital. she admitted that she was very exclusive; but, if he were acquainted with new york, he would see that one had to be. and her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city, which she presented to him in many different lights, was,

to winterbourne’s imagination, almost oppressively striking.
he immediately perceived, from her tone, that miss daisy miller’s place in the social scale was low. “i am afraid you don’t approve of them,” he said.
“they are very common,” mrs. costello declared. “they are the sort of americans that one does one’s duty by not—not accepting.”
“ah, you don’t accept them?” said the young man.
“i can’t, my dear frederick. i would if i could, but i can’t.”
“the young girl is very pretty,” said winterbourne in a moment.
“of course she’s pretty. but she is very common.”
“i see what you mean, of course,” said winterbourne after another pause.
“she has that charming look that they all have,” his aunt resumed. “

“but, my dear aunt, she is not, after all, a comanche savage.”
“she is a young lady,” said mrs. costello, “who has an intimacy with her mamma’s courier.”
“an intimacy with the courier?” the young man demanded.
“oh, the mother is just as bad! they treat the courier like a familiar friend—like a gentleman. i shouldn’t wonder if he dines with them. very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners, such fine clothes, so like a gentleman. he probably corresponds to the young lady’s idea of a count. he sits with them in the garden in the evening. i think he smokes.”

erbourne listened with interest to these disclosures; they helped him to make up his mind about miss daisy. evidently she was rather wild. “well,” he said, “i am not a courier, and yet she was very charming to me.”
“you had better have said at first,” said mrs. costello with dignity, “that you had made her acquaintance.”
“we simply met in the garden, and we talked a bit.”
“tout bonnement! and pray what did you say?”
“i said i should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt.”
“i am much obliged to you.”
“it was to guarantee my respectability,” said winterbourne.
“and pray who is to guarantee hers?”
“ah, you are cruel!” said the young man. “she’s a very nice young girl.”
“you don’t say that as if you beli

“she is completely uncultivated,” winterbourne went on. “but she is wonderfully pretty, and, in short, she is very nice. to prove that i believe it, i am going to take her to the chateau de chillon.”
“you two are going off there together? i should say it proved just the contrary. how long had you known her, may i ask, when this interesting project was formed? you haven’t been twenty-four hours in the house.”
“i have known her half an hour!” said winterbourne, smiling

“dear me!” cried mrs. costello. “what a dreadful girl!”
her nephew was silent for some moments. “you really think, then,” he began earnestly, and with a desire for trustworthy information—“you really think that—” but he paused again.
“think what, sir?” said his aunt.
“that she is the sort of young lady who expects a man, sooner or later, to carry her off?”
“i haven’t the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do. but i really think that you had better not meddle with little american gir

 the country. you will be sure to make some great mistake. you are too innocent.”
“my dear aunt, i am not so innocent,” said winterbourne, smiling and curling his mustache.
“you are guilty too, then!”
winterbourne continued to curl his mustache meditatively. “you won’t let the poor girl know you then?” he asked at last.
“is it literally true that she is going to the chateau de chillon with you?”
“i think that she fully intends it.”
“then, my dear frederick,” said mrs. costello, “i must decline the honor of her acquaintance. i am an old woman, but i am not too old, thank heaven, to be shocked!”
“but don’t they all do these things—the young girls in america?” winterbourne inquired.
mrs. costello stared a moment. “i should like to see my granddaughters do them!” she declared grimly.
this seemed to throw some light upon the matter, for winterbourne remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in new york were “tremendous flirts.” if, therefore, mi

nounce it.
“oh, dear, i can’t say all that!” said his companion with a laugh. but by this time they had come up to mrs. miller, who, as they drew near, walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it, looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them. “mother!” said the young girl in a tone of decision. upon this the elder lady turned round. “mr. winterbourne,” said miss daisy miller, introducing the young man very frankly and prettily. “common,” she was, as mrs. costello had pronounced her; yet it was a wonder to winterbourne that, with her commonness, she had a singularly delicate grace.
her mother was a small, spare, light person, with a wandering eye, a very exiguous nose, and a large forehead, decorated with a certain amount of thin, much frizzled hair. like her daughter, mrs. miller was dressed with extreme elegance; she had enormous diamonds in her ears. so far as winterbourne could observe, she gave him no greeting—she certainly was not looking at him.

 for the winter and has already asked me to come and see her.”
“i don’t want you to come for your aunt,” said daisy; “i want you to come for me.” and this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman. he declared that, at any rate, he would certainly come. after this daisy stopped teasing. winterbourne took a carriage, and they drove back to vevey in the dusk; the young girl was very quiet.
in the evening winterbourne mentioned to mrs. costello that he had spent the afternoon at chillon with miss daisy miller.
“the americans—of the courier?” asked this lady.
“ah, happily,” said winterbourne, “the courier stayed at home.”
“she went with you all alone?”
“all alone.”
mrs. costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle. “and that,” she exclaimed, “is the young person whom you wanted me to know!”

in the natural course of events, winterbourne, on arriving in rome, would presently have ascertained mrs. miller’s address at the american banker’s and have gone to pay his compliments to miss daisy. “after what happened at vevey, i think i may certainly call upon them,” he said to mrs. costello.
“if, after what happens—at vevey and everywhere—you desire to keep up the acquaintance, you are very welcome. of course a man may know everyone. men are welcome to the privilege!”
“pray what is it that happens—here, for instance?” winterbourne demanded.
“the girl goes about alone with her foreigners. as to what happens further, you must apply elsewhere for information. she has picked up half a dozen of the regular roman fortune hunters, and she takes them about to people’s ho

uses. when she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache.”
“and where is the mother?”
“i haven’t the least idea. they are very dreadful people.”
winterbourne meditated a moment. “they are very ignorant—very innocent only. depend upon it they are not bad.”
“they are hopelessly vulgar,” said mrs. costello. “whether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being ‘bad’ is a question for the metaphysicians. they are bad enough to dislike, at any rate; and for this short life that is quite enough.”
the news that daisy miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful mustaches checked winterbourne’s impulse to go straightway to see her. he had, perhaps, not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart, but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so

e western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars, whereupon daisy’s companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened it. she came a little nearer, and he held the parasol over her; then, still holding it, he let it rest upon her shoulder, so that both of their heads were hidden from winterbourne. this young man lingered a moment, then he began to walk. but he walked—not toward the couple with the parasol; toward the residence of his aunt, mrs. costello.
he flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he, at least, asked for mrs. miller at her hotel. this lady and her daughter, however, were not at home; and on the next day after, repeating his visit, winterbourne again had the misfortune not to find them. mrs. walker’s party took place on the evening of the third day, and, in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess, winterbourne was among the guests. mrs. walker was one of th

 at him whenever he spoke; she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that; she was constantly “chaffing” and abusing him. she appeared completely to have forgotten that winterbourne had said anything to displease her at mrs. walker’s little party. one sunday afternoon, having gone to st. peter’s with his aunt, winterbourne perceived daisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable giovanelli. presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to mrs. costello. this lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass, and then she said:
“that’s what makes you so pensive in these days, eh?”
“i had not the least idea i was pensive,” said the young man.
“you are very much preoccupied; you are thinking of something.”
“and what is it,” he asked, “that you accuse me of thinking of?”
“of that young lady’s—miss baker’s, miss chandler’s—what’s her name?—miss miller’s intrigue with that little barber’s block.”
“do yo

u call it an intrigue,” winterbourne asked—“an affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity?”
“that’s their folly,” said mrs. costello; “it’s not their merit.”
“no,” rejoined winterbourne, with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded. “i don’t believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue.”
“i have heard a dozen people speak of it; they say she is quite carried away by him.”
“they are certainly very intimate,” said winterbourne.
mrs. costello inspected the young couple again with her optical instrument. “he is very handsome. one easily sees how it is. she thinks him the m

ter, even, than the courier. it was the courier probably who introduced him; and if he succeeds in marrying the young lady, the courier will come in for a magnificent commission.”
“i don’t believe she thinks of marrying him,” said winterbourne, “and i don’t believe he hopes to marry her.”
“you may be very sure she thinks of nothing. she goes on from day to day, from hour to hour, as they did in the golden age. i can imagine nothing more vulgar. and at the same time,” added mrs. costello, “depend upon it that she may tell you any moment that she is ‘engaged.’”
“i think that is more than giovanelli expects,” said winterbourne.
“who is giovanelli?”
“the little italian. i have asked questions about him and learned something. he is apparently a perfectly respectable little man. i believe he is, in a small way, a cavaliere avvocato. but he doesn’t move in what are called the first circles. i think it is really not absolutely impossible that the courier introduced

 rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her. that must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck. he has nothing but his handsome face to offer, and there is a substantial mr. miller in that mysterious land of dollars. giovanelli knows that he hasn’t a title to offer. if he were only a count or a marchese! he must wonder at his luck, at the way they have taken him up.”
“he accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks miss miller a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies!” said mrs. costello.
“it is very true,” winterbourne pursued, “that daisy and her mamma have not yet risen to that stage of—what shall i call it?—of culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins. i believe that they are intellectually incapable of that conception.”
“ah! but the avvocato can’t believe it,” said mrs. costello.
of the observation excited by daisy’s “intrigue,” winterbourne gathered that day at st. peter’s sufficient evidence. a dozen of the american colo

nists in rome came to talk with mrs. costello, who sat on a little portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters. the vesper service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the adjacent choir, and meanwhile, between mrs. costello and her friends, there was a great deal said about poor little miss miller’s going really “too far.” winterbourne was not pleased with what he heard, but when, coming out upon the great steps of the church, he saw daisy, who had emerged before him, get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away through the cynical streets of rome, he could not deny to himself that she was going very far indeed. he felt very sorry for her—not exactly that he believed that she had completely lost

the subtle roman again dropped his eyes. “if she had lived, i should have got nothing. she would never have married me, i am sure.”
“she would never have married you?”
“for a moment i hoped so. but no. i am sure.”
winterbourne listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the april daisies. when he turned away again, mr. giovanelli, with his light, slow step, had retired.
winterbourne almost immediately left rome; but the following summer he again met his aunt, mrs. costello at vevey. mrs. costello was fond of vevey. in the interval winterbourne had often thought of daisy miller and her mystifying manners. one day he spoke of her to his aunt—said it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice.
“i am sure i don’t know,” said mrs. costello. “how did your injustice affect her?”
“she sent me a message before her death which i didn’t understand at the time; but i have understood it since. she would have appreciated one’s esteem.”
“is that

a modest way,” asked mrs. costello, “of saying that she would have reciprocated one’s affection?”
winterbourne offered no answer to this question; but he presently said, “you were right in that remark that you made last summer. i was booked to make a mistake. i have lived too long in foreign parts.”
nevertheless, he went back to live at geneva, whence there continue to come the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn: a report that he is “studying” hard—an intimation that he is much interested in a
