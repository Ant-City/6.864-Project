[CHARACTER]
natasha is one of tolstoy's grandest creations, a representation
of joyful vitality and the ability to experience life fully and
boldly. the antithesis of helene kuragina, her eventual husband's
first wife, natasha is as lively and spontaneous as helene is stony
and scheming. from infancy to adulthood, natasha charms everyone
who meets her, from the guests of the rostovs who witness her unintelligible
comments about her doll, to andrew bolkonski, anatole kuragin, and
finally pierre bezukhov. yet, despite her charms, natasha never
comes across as a show-off or a flirt angling for men's attentions.
whether running in the fields in a yellow dress, singing on her
balcony at otradnoe, or simply sitting in an opera box, natasha
inspires desire simply by being herself, by existing in her own
unique way. her simplicity sometimes makes her naive, however, as
when she misunderstands her momentary passion for anatole and makes
absurd plans to elope with him. but natasha repents her error with
a sincerity that elicits forgiveness even from the wronged andrew
on his deathbed. natasha's spiritual development is not as philosophical
or bookish as pierre's, but it is just as profound. she changes
radically by the end of the novel, growing wise in a way that makes
her pierre's spiritual equal.
