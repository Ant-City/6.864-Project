[prologue]

                enter the ghost of andrea, and with him revenge.

  ghost.  when this eternal substance of my soul
    did live imprison'd in my wanton flesh,
    each in their function serving others' need,
    i was a courtier in the spanish court:
    my name was don andrea; my descent,
    though not ignoble, yet inferior far
    to gracious fortunes of my tender youth,
    for there, in prime and pride of all my

,
    till to revenge thou know when, where and how.
    how now?  what noise, what coil is that you keep?

                a noise within.

                enter a servant.

  ser.  here are a sort of poor petitioners
    that are importunate, and it shall please you, sir,
    that you should plead their cases to the king.

  hiero.  that i should plead their several actions?
    why, let them enter, and let me see them.

                enter three citizens and an old man
                [don bazulto].

  i cit.  so i tell you this: for learning and for law
    there is not any advocate in spain
    that can prevail or will take half the pain
    that he will in pursuit of equity.

  hiero.  come near, you men, that thus importune me!
    [aside]  now must i bear a face of gravity,
    for thus i us'd, before my marshallship,
    to plead in causes as corrigedor.--
    come on, sirs, what's the matter?

  ii cit.               sir, an action.

  hiero.  of battery?

ion of the case.

  iii cit.  mine an ejectionae firmae by a lease.

  hiero.  content you, sirs; are you determined
    that i should plead your several actions?

  i cit.  aye, sir; and here's my declaration.

  ii cit.  and here is my bond.

  iii cit.              and here is my lease.

                they give him papers.

  hiero. but wherefore stands yon silly man so mute,
    with mournful eyes and hands to heav'n uprear'd?
    come hither, father; let me know thy cause.

  senex, [don bazulto].  o worthy sir, my cause but slightly known
    may move the hearts of warlike myrmidons,
    and melt the corsic rocks with ruthful tears!

  hiero.  say, father; tell me what's thy suit!

  bazulto.  no, sir, could my woes
    give way unto my most distressful words,
    then should i not in paper, as you see,
    with ink bewray what blood began in me.

  hiero. what's here?  "the humble supplication
    of don bazulto for his murder'd son."

  bazulto.  aye, sir.

  hiero.        no, sir,

it was my murder'd son!
    oh, my son, my son! oh, my son horatio!
    but mine or thine, bazulto, be content;
    here, take my handkerchief and wipe thine eyes,
    whiles wretched i in thy mishaps may see
    the lively portrait of my dying self.

                he draweth out a bloody napkin.

    o, no; not this!  horatio, this was thine!
    and when i dy'd it in thy dearest blood,
    this was a token twixt thy soul and me
    that of thy death revenged i should be.
    but here: take this, and this!  what? my purse?
    aye, this and that and all of them are thine;
    for all as o

                exit hieronimo and they after.

  ii cit.                       save my bond!

                enter hieronimo.

  ii cit.  save my bond!

  iii cit.              alas my lease, it cost me
    ten pound, and you, my lord, have torn the same!

  hiero.  that can not be, i gave it never a wound;
    show me one drop of blood fall from the same!
    how is it possible i should slay it then?
    tush, no!  run after, catch me if you can!

                exeunt all but don bazulto.

                bazulto remains till hieronimo enters
                again, who, staring him in the face, speaks:

    and art thou come, horatio, from the depth,
    to ask for justice in this upper earth?
    to tell thy father thou art unreveng'd?
    to wring more tears from isabella's eyes,
    whose lights are dimm'd with over-long laments?
    go back, my son, complain to eacus;
    for here's no justice.  gentle boy, begone;
    for justice is exiled from the earth.

    thy mother cries on righteous radamant
    for just revenge against the murderers.

  bazulto.  alas, my lord, whence springs this troubled speech?

  hiero.  but let me look on my horatio:
    sweet boy, how art thou chang'd in death's black shade!
    had proserpine no pity on thy youth,
    but suffer'd thy fair crimson-colour'd spring
    with wither'd winter to be blasted thus?
    horatio, thou are older than thy father:
    ah, ruthless father, that favour thus transforms.

  ba.  ah, my good lord, i am not your young son.

  hie.  what!  not my son? thou then a fury art
