species; especially the europeans.

i have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but i
forbear troubling myself or you any further.  i must freely confess, that
since my last return, some corruptions of my _yahoo_ nature have revived
in me by conversing with a few of your species, and particularly those of
my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else i should never have
attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming the _yahoo_ race in
this kingdom: but i have now done with all such visionary schemes for
ever.

hen i left mr. bates, i went down to my
father: where, by the assistance of him and my uncle john, and some other
relations, i got forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to
maintain me at leyden: there i studied physic two years and seven months,
knowing it would be useful in long voyages.

soon after my return from leyden, i was recommended by my good master,
mr. bates, to be surgeon to the swallow, captain abraham pannel,
commander; with whom i continued three years and a half, making a voyage
or two into the levant, and some other parts.  when i came back i
resolved to settle in london; to which mr. bates, my master, encouraged
me, and by him i was recommended to several patients.  i took part of a
small house in the old jewry; and being advised to alter my condition, i
married mrs. mary burton, second daughter to mr. edmund burton, hosier,
in newgate-street, with whom i received four hundred pounds for a
portion.

the last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, i grew weary of the
sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family.  i removed
from the old jewry to fetter lane, and from thence to wapping, hoping to
get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to account.  after
three years expectation that things would mend, i accepted an
advantageous offer from captain william prichard, master of the antelope,
who was making a voyage to the south sea.  we set sail from bristol, may
4, 1699, and our voyage was at first very prosperous.

it would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the
particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to inform
him, that in our passage from thence to the east indies, we were driven
by a violent storm to the north-west of van diemen’s land.  by an
observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes
south.  twelve of our crew were

when, my left hand being already loose, i could easily free myself: and
as for the inhabitants, i had reason to believe i might be a match for
the greatest army they could bring against me, if they were all of the
same size with him that i saw.  but fortune disposed otherwise of me.
when the people observed i was quiet, they discharged no more arrows;
but, by the noise i heard, i knew their numbers increased; and about four
yards from me, over against my right ear, i heard a knocking for above an
hour, like that of people at work; when turning my head that way, as well
as the pegs and strings would permit me, i saw a stage erected about a
foot and a half from the ground, capable of holding four of the
inhabitants, with two or three ladders to mount it: from whence one of
them, who seemed to be a person of quality, made me a long speech,
whereof i understood not one syllable.  but i should have mentioned, that
before the principal person began his oration, he cried out three

(perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger
frequently to my mouth, to signify that i wanted food.  the _hurgo_ (for
so they call a great lord, as i afterwards learnt) understood me very
well.  he descended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders
should be applied to my sides, on which above a hundred of the
inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full
of meat, which had been provided and sent thither by the king’s orders,
upon the first intelligence he received of me.  i observed there was the
flesh of several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste.
there were shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and
very well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark.  i ate them by
two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the
bigness of musket bullets.  they supplied me as fast as they could,
showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bu

 my liberty.  it appeared
that he understood me well enough, for he shook his head by way of
disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show that i must be
carried as a prisoner.  however, he made other signs to let me understand
that i should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment.
whereupon i once more thought of attempting to break my bonds; but again,
when i felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands, which were
all in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them, and
observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased, i gave tokens
to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased.  upon
this, the _hurgo_ and his train withdrew, with much civility and cheerful
countenances.  soon after i heard a general shout, with frequent
repetitions of the words _peplom selan_; and i felt great numbers of
people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree, that i was
able to turn upon my right, and to ease myself with making water

ge being stopped a while, to adjust
something that was out of order, two or three of the young natives had
the curiosity to see how i looked when i was asleep; they climbed up into
the engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer
in the guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my
left nostril, which tickled my nose like a straw, and made me sneeze
violently; whereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks
before i knew the cause of my waking so suddenly.  we made a long march
the remaining part of the day, and, rested at night with five hundred
guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows and
arrows, ready to shoot me if i should offer to stir.  the next morning at
sun-rise we continued our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of
the city gates about noon.  the emperor, and all his court, came out to
meet us; but his great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to
endanger his person by mounting on

at the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple,
esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom; which, having been
polluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was, according to the
zeal of those people, looked upon as profane, and therefore had been
applied to common use, and all the ornaments and furniture carried away.
in this edifice it was determined i should lodge.  the great gate
fronting to the north was about four feet high, and almost two feet wide,
through which i could easily creep.  on each side of the gate was a small
window, not above six inches from the ground: i

the king’s smith conveyed fourscore and eleven chains, like those that
hang to a lady’s watch in europe, and almost as large, which were locked
to my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks.  over against this temple,
on the other side of the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there
was a turret at least five feet high.  here the emperor ascended, with
many principal lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me,
as i was told, for i could not see them.  it was reckoned that above a

but a proclamation was soon issued, to forbid it upon pain of death.
when the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose, they cut
all the strings that bound me; whereupon i rose up, with as melancholy a
disposition as ever i had in my life.  but the noise and astonishment of
the people, at seeing me rise and walk, are not to be expressed.  the
chains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not
only the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle, but,
being fixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and
lie at my full length in the temple.

ordered his cooks and butlers, who were already prepared, to give me
victuals and drink, which they pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon
wheels, till i could reach them.  i took these vehicles and soon emptied
them all; twenty of them were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each
of the former afforded me two or three good mouthfuls; and i emptied the
liquor of ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one
vehicle, drinking it off at a draught; and so i did with the rest.  the
empress, and young princes of the blood of both sexes, attended by many
ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident that
happened to the emperor’s horse, they alighted, and came near his person,
which i am now going to describe.  he is taller by almost the breadth of
my nail, than any of his court; which alone is enough to strike an awe
into the beholders.  his features are strong and masculine, with an

punishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands; which some
of his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forward with the butt-ends
of their pikes into my reach.  i took them all in my right hand, put five
of them into my coat-pocket; and as to the sixth, i made a countenance as
if i would eat him alive.  the poor man squalled terribly, and the
colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me
take out my penknife: but i soon put them out of fear; for, looking
mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, i set him
gently on the ground, and away he ran.  i treated the rest in the same
manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket; and i observed both the
soldiers and people were highly delighted at this mark of my clemency,
which was represented very much to my advantage at court.

towards night i got with some difficulty into my house, where i lay on
the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during which time,
the empe

of the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my
house; a hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn together, made up the
breadth and length; and these were four double: which, however, kept me
but very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of smooth
stone.  by the same computation, they provided me with sheets, blankets,
and coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to
hardships.

as the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought
prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that
the villages were almost emptied; and great neglect of tillage and
household affairs must have ensued, if his imperial majesty had not
provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this
inconveniency.  he directed that those who had already beheld me should
return home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house,
without license from the court; whereby the secretaries of state go

in the mean time the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what
course should be taken with me; and i was afterwards assured by a
particular friend, a person of great quality, who was as much in the
secret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning me.
they apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very expensive,
and might cause a famine.  sometimes they determined to starve me; or at
least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows, which would
soon despatch me; but again they considered, that the stench of so large
a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread
through the whole kingdom.  in the midst of these consultations, several
officers of the army went to the door of the great council-chamber, and

was pleased to assist my masters in teaching me.  we began already to
converse together in some sort; and the first words i learnt, were to
express my desire “that he would please give me my liberty;” which i
every day repeated on my knees.  his answer, as i could comprehend it,
was, “that this must be a work of time, not to be thought on without the
advice of his council, and that first i must _lumos kelmin pesso desmar
lon emposo_;” that is, swear a peace with him and his kingdom.  however,
that i should be used with all kindness.  and he advised me to “acquire,
by my patience and discreet behaviour, the good opinion of himself and
his subjects.”  he desired “i would not take it ill, if he gave orders to
certain proper officers to search me; for probably i might carry about me
several weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered
the bulk of so prodigious a person.”  i said, “his majesty should be
satisfied; for i was ready to strip myself

, and turn up my pockets before
him.”  this i delivered part in words, and part in signs.  he replied,
“that, by the laws of the kingdom, i must be searched by two of his
officers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent and
assistance; and he had so good an opinion of my generosity and justice,
as to trust their persons in my hands; that whatever they took from me,
should be returned when i left the country, or paid for at the rate which
i would set upon them.”  i took up the two officers in my hands, put them
first into my coat-pockets, and then into every other pocket about me,
except my two fobs, and anot

court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that i began to
conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time.  i took all
possible methods to cultivate this favourable disposition.  the natives
came, by degrees, to be less apprehensive of any danger from me.  i would
sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my hand; and at
last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide-and-seek
in my hair.  i had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking
the language.  the emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with
several of the country shows, wherein they exceed all nations i have
known, both for dexterity and magnificence.  i was diverted with none so
much as that of the rope-dancers, performed upon a slender white thread,
extended about two feet, and twelve inches from the ground.  upon which i
shall desire liberty, with the reader’s patience, to enlarge a little.

this diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates

h fatal accidents, whereof great
numbers are on record.  i myself have seen two or three candidates break
a limb.  but the danger is much greater, when the ministers themselves
are commanded to show their dexterity; for, by contending to excel
themselves and their fellows, they strain so far that there is hardly one
of them who has not received a fall, and some of them two or three.  i
was assured that, a year or two before my arrival, flimnap would
infallibly have broke his neck, if one of the king’s cushions, that
accidentally lay on the ground, had not weakened the force of his fall.

there is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the
emperor and empress, and first minister, upon particular occasions.  the
emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long;
one is blue, the other red, and the third green.  these threads are
proposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to
distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favour.  the ceremon

and if his majesty pleased, they would
undertake to bring it with only five horses.  i presently knew what they
meant, and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence.  it seems,
upon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck, i was in such
confusion, that before i came to the place where i went to sleep, my hat,
which i had fastened with a string to my head while i was rowing, and had
stuck on all the time i was swimming, fell off after i came to land; the
string, as i conjecture, breaking by some accident, which i never
observed, but thought my hat had been lost at sea.  i entreated his
imperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as
possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next
day the waggoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition; they
had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and half of the edge, and
fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by a long cord to
the harness, and thus my hat was dragg

ommanded me to rise; and after many
gracious expressions, which, to avoid the censure of vanity, i shall not
repeat, he added, “that he hoped i should prove a useful servant, and
well deserve all the favours he had already conferred upon me, or might
do for the future.”

the reader may please to observe, that, in the last article of the
recovery of my liberty, the emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity of
meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724 lilliputians.  some
time after, asking a friend at court how they came to fix on that
determinate number, he told me that his majesty’s mathematicians, having
taken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant, and finding it to
exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one, they concluded from the
similarity of their bodies, that mine must contain at least 1724 of
theirs, and consequently would require as much food as was necessary to
support that number of lilliputians.  by which the reader may conceive an
idea of the inge

highness, the heir to the crown, to have some tendency towards the high
heels; at least we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higher
than the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait.  now, in the midst
of these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with an invasion from the
island of blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe,
almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty.  for as to what we
have heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and states in the
world inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our philosophers
are in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you dropped from the
moon, or one of the stars; because it is certain, that a hundred mortals
of your bulk would in a short time destroy all the fruits and cattle of
his majesty’s dominions: besides, our histories of six thousand moons
make no mention of any other regions than the two great empires of
lilliput and blefuscu.  which two mighty power

s have, as i was going to
tell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for six-and-thirty moons
past.  it began upon the following occasion.  it is allowed on all hands,
that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them, was upon the
larger end; but his present majesty’s grandfather, while he was a boy,
going to eat an egg, and breaking it according to the ancient practice,
happened to cut one of his fingers.  whereupon the emperor his father
published an edict, commanding all his subjects, upon great penalties, to
break the smaller end of their eggs.  the people so highly resented this
law, that our histories tell us, there have been six rebellions raised on
that account; wherein one emperor lost his life, and another his crown.
these civil commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of
blefuscu; and when they were qu

d for refuge
to that empire.  it is computed that eleven thousand persons have at
several times suffered death, rather than submit to break their eggs at
the smaller end.  many hundred large volumes have been published upon
this controversy: but the books of the big-endians have been long
forbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law of holding
employments.  during the course of these troubles, the emperors of
blefusca did frequently expostulate by their ambassadors, accusing us of
making a schism in religion, by offending against a fundamental doctrine
of our great prophet lustrog, in the fifty-fourth chapter of the
blundecral (which is their alcoran).  this, however, is thought to be a
mere strain upon the text; for the words are these: ‘that all true
believers break their eggs at the convenient end.’  and which is the
convenient end, seems, in my humble opinion to be left to every man’s
conscience, or at least in the power of the chief magistrate to
determine.  now, the

e back to my
house, and gave orders (for which i had a warrant) for a great quantity
of the strongest cable and bars of iron.  the cable was about as thick as
packthread and the bars of the length and size of a knitting-needle.  i
trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason i twisted
three of the iron bars together, bending the extremities into a hook.
having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, i went back to the
north-east coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked
into the sea, in my leathern jerkin, about half an hour before high
water.  i waded with what haste i could, and swam in the middle about
thirty yards, till i felt ground.  i arrived at the fleet in less than
half an hour.  the enemy was so frightened when they saw me, that they
leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be
fewer than thirty thousand souls.  i then took my tackling, and,
fastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, i tied all the cords

nly thought of an expedient.  i kept, among other
little necessaries, a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as i
observed before, had escaped the emperor’s searchers.  these i took out
and fastened as strongly as i could upon my nose, and thus armed, went on
boldly with my work, in spite of the enemy’s arrows, many of which struck
against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect,
further than a little to discompose them.  i had now fastened all the
hooks, and, taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship
would stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors, so that the
boldest part of my enterprise remained.  i therefore let go the cord, and
leaving the looks fixed to the ships, i resolutely cut with my knife the
cables that fastened the anchors, receiving about two hundred shots in my
face and hands; then i took up the knotted end of the cables, to which my
hooks were tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy’s largest
men of

when i advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet more in pain,
because i was under water to my neck.  the emperor concluded me to be
drowned, and that the enemy’s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner:
but he was soon eased of his fears; for the channel growing shallower
every step i made, i came in a short time within hearing, and holding up
the end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, i cried in a loud
voice, “long live the most puissant king of lilliput!”  this great prince
received me at my landing with all possible encomiums, and created me a
_nardac_ upon the spot, which is the highest title of honour among them.

his majesty desired i would take some other opportunity of bringing all
the rest of his enemy’s ships into his ports.  and so unmeasureable is
the ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than
reducing the whole empire of blefuscu into a province, and governing it,
by a viceroy; of destroying th

five hundred persons, and their entry was very magnificent, suitable to
the grandeur of their master, and the importance of their business.  when
their treaty was finished, wherein i did them several good offices by the
credit i now had, or at least appeared to have, at court, their
excellencies, who were privately told how much i had been their friend,
made me a visit in form.  they began with many compliments upon my valour
and generosity, invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their master’s
name, and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength,
of which they had heard so many wonders; wherein i readily obliged them,
but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars.

when i had for some time entertained their excellencies, to their
infinite satisfaction and surprise, i desired they would do me the honour
to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master, the
renown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole

in that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and
the emperor (to do him justice), never once mentioned them to me.
however, it was not long before i had an opportunity of doing his
majesty, at least as i then thought, a most signal service.  i was
alarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door; by
which, being suddenly awaked, i was in some kind of terror.  i heard the
word _burglum_ repeated incessantly: several of the emperor’s court,
making their way through the crowd, entreated me to come immediately to
the palace, where her imperial majesty’s apartment was on fire, by the
carelessness of a maid of honour, who fell asleep while she was reading a
romance.  i got up in an instant; and orders being given to clear the way
before me, and it being likewise a moonshine night, i made a shift to get
to the palace without trampling on any of the people.  i found they had
already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment, and were wel

ey were as well executed.  the first i shall mention, relates to
informers.  all crimes against the state, are punished here with the
utmost severity; but, if the person accused makes his innocence plainly
to appear upon his trial, the accuser is immediately put to an
ignominious death; and out of his goods or lands the innocent person is
quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time, for the danger he
underwent, for the hardship of his imprisonment, and for all the charges
he has been at in making his defence; or, if that fund be deficient, it
is largely supplied by the crown.  the emperor also confers on him some
public mark of his favour, and proclamation is made of his innocence
through the whole city.

they look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore seldom
fail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and vigilance,
with a very common understanding, may preserve a man’s goods from
thieves, but honesty has no defence against superior cunning; and, since

yments could never be put into
such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified; and, at least,
that the mistakes committed by ignorance, in a virtuous disposition,
would never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal, as the
practices of a man, whose inclinations led him to be corrupt, and who had
great abilities to manage, to multiply, and defend his corruptions.

in like manner, the disbelief of a divine providence renders a man
incapable of holding any public station; for, since kings avow themselves
to be the deputies of providence, the lilliputians think nothing can be
more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as disown the authority
under which he acts.

in relating these and the following laws, i would only be understood to
mean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous corruptions,
into which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man.  for,

long.  then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a
mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the
wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old
shirt, which i displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they
fitted me exactly.  three hundred tailors were employed in the same
manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my
measure.  i kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my
neck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line
from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat:
but my waist and arms i measured myself.  when my clothes were finished,
which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been
able to hold them), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in
england, only that mine were all of a colour.

before i proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it may be
proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for two
months forming against me.

i had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger to courts, for which i was
unqualified by the meanness of my condition.  i had indeed heard and read
enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers, but never
expected to have found such terrible effects of them, in so remote a
country, governed, as i thought, by very different maxims from those in
europe.

it was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very
different, as i have been assured, from the practice of former times,)
that after the court had decreed any cruel execution, either to gratify
the monarch’s resentment, or the malice of a favourite, the emperor
always made a speech to his whole council, expressing his great lenity
and tenderness, as qualities known and confessed by all the world.  this
speech was immediately published throughout the kingdom; nor did any
thing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majesty’s
mercy; because it was observed, that the more these praises were enlarged
and insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer
more innocent.  yet, as to myself, i must confess, having never been
designed for a courtier, either by my birth or education, i was so ill a
judge of things, that i could not discover the lenity and favour of this
sentence, but conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rat

i shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my
reception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so great
a prince; nor of the difficulties i was in for want of a house and bed,
being forced to lie on the ground, wrapped up in my coverlet.



chapter viii.


the author, by a lucky accident, finds means to leave blefuscu; and,
after some difficulties, returns safe to his native country.

three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the north-east
coast of the island, i observed, about half a league off in the sea,
somewhat that looked like a boat overturned.  i pulled off my shoes and
stockings, and, wailing two or three hundred yards, i found the object to
approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a
real boat, which i supposed might by some tempest have been driven from a
ship.  whereupon, i returned immediately towards the city, and desired
his imperial majesty to lend me tw

o the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me; the
wind being favourable, the seamen towed, and i shoved, until we arrived
within forty yards of the shore; and, waiting till the tide was out, i
got dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men, with
ropes and engines, i made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it
was but little damaged.

i shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties i was under, by the
help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my boat to
the royal port of blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people appeared
upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a vessel.
i told the emperor “that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way,
to carry me to some place whence i might return into my native country;
and begged his majesty’s orders for getting materials to fit it up,
together with his license to depart;” which, after some kind
expostulations, he was pleased to grant.

empires, his master expected that his brother of blefuscu would give
orders to have me sent back to lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be
punished as a traitor.”

the emperor of blefuscu, having taken three days to consult, returned an
answer consisting of many civilities and excuses.  he said, “that as for
sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that, although i
had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for
many good offices i had done him in making the peace.  that, however,
both their majesties would soon be made easy; for i had found a
prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had
given orders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction; and he
hoped, in a few weeks, both empires would be freed from so insupportable
an encumbrance.”

with this answer the envoy returned to lilliput; and the monarch of
blefuscu related to me all that had passed; offering me at the same time

find the emperor at all displeased; and i discovered, by a certain
accident, that he was very glad of my resolution, and so were most of his
ministers.

these considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than
i intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very readily
contributed.  five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my
boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen folds of their
strongest linen together.  i was at the pains of making ropes and cables,
by twisting ten, twenty, or thirty of the thickest and strongest of
theirs.  a great stone that i happened to find, after a long search, by
the sea-shore, served me for an anchor.  i had the tallow of three
hundred cows, for greasing my boat, and other uses.  i was at incredible
pains in cutting down some of the largest timber-trees, for oars and
masts, wherein i was, however, much assisted by his majesty’s
ship-carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them, after i had done t

d of the line, as
our captain found by an observation he took the 2nd of may, at which time
the wind ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat i was not a little
rejoiced.  but he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of
those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly
happened the day following: for the southern wind, called the southern
monsoon, began to set in.

finding it was likely to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood
by to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns
were all fast, and handed the mizen.  the ship lay very broad off, so we
thought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or hulling.  we
reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm
was hard a-weather.  the ship wore bravely.  we belayed the fore
down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got
the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it.  it was a
very fierce storm; the sea broke stra

 wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the
sea, and i walked alone about a mile on the other side, where i observed
the country all barren and rocky.  i now began to be weary, and seeing
nothing to entertain my curiosity, i returned gently down towards the
creek; and the sea being full in my view, i saw our men already got into
the boat, and rowing for life to the ship.  i was going to holla after
them, although it had been to little purpose, when i observed a huge
creature walking after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not
much deeper than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had
the start of him half a league, and, the sea thereabouts being full of
sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat.  this
i was afterwards told, for i durst not stay to see the issue of the
adventure; but ran as fast as i could the way i first went, and then
climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the country.  i
found it fully

cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the
length of the grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for
hay, was about twenty feet high.

i fell into a high road, for so i took it to be, though it served to the
inhabitants only as a foot-path through a field of barley.  here i walked
on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now near
harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet.  i was an hour walking
to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least
one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that i could
make no computation of their altitude.  there was a stile to pass from
this field into the next.  it had four steps, and a stone to cross over
when you came to the uppermost.  it was impossible for me to climb this
stile, because every step was six-feet high, and the upper stone about
twenty.  i was endeavouring to find some gap in the hedge, when i

ered one of the inhabitants in the next field, advancing towards
the stile, of the same size with him whom i saw in the sea pursuing our
boat.  he appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and took about
ten yards at every stride, as near as i could guess.  i was struck with
the utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn,
whence i saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field
on the right hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than
a speaking-trumpet: but the noise was so high in the air, that at first i
certainly thought it was thunder.  whereupon seven monsters, like
himself, came towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands, each hook
about the largeness of six scythes.  these people were not so well clad
as the first, whose servants or labourers they seemed to be; for, upon
some words he spoke, they went to reap the cor

at the same time i heard the reapers not a hundred yards behind me.
being quite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and
dispair, i lay down between two ridges, and heartily wished i might there
end my days.  i bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children.  i
lamented my own folly and wilfulness, in attempting a second voyage,
against the advice of all my friends and relations.  in this terrible
agitation of mind, i could not forbear thinking of lilliput, whose
inhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in
the world; where i was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and
perform those other actions, which will be recorded for ever in the
chronicles of that empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them,
although attested by millions.  i reflected what a mortification it must
prove to me, to appear as inconsiderable in this nation, as one single
lilliputian would be among us.  but this i conceived wa

world, whereof we have yet no discovery.

scared and confounded as i was, i could not forbear going on with these
reflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of the
ridge where i lay, made me apprehend that with the next step i should be
squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his reaping-hook.
and therefore, when he was again about to move, i screamed as loud as
fear could make me: whereupon the huge creature trod short, and, looking
round about under him for some time, at last espied me as i lay on the
ground.  he considered awhile, with the caution of one who endeavours to
lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not
be able either to scratch or bite him, as i myself have sometimes done
with a weasel in england.  at length he ventured to take me behind, by
the middle, between his fore-finger and thumb, and brought me within
three yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly.

; letting him know, as well as i could, how
cruelly i was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger.  he seemed to
apprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me
gently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was
a substantial farmer, and the same person i had first seen in the field.

the farmer having (as i suppose by their talk) received such an account
of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about
the size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of my
coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature
had given me.  he blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face.
he called his hinds about him, and asked them, as i afterwards learned,
whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature that
resembled me.  he then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but
i got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and forward, to let
those people see i had no

after offering it to him several times, i thought it best to do.

the farmer, by this time, was convinced i must be a rational creature.
he spoke often to me; but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like
that of a water-mill, yet his words were articulate enough.  i answered
as loud as i could in several languages, and he often laid his ear within
two yards of me: but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to
each other.  he then sent his servants to their work, and taking his
handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it on his left
hand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upward, making me
a sign to step into it, as i could easily do, for it was not above a foot
in thickness.  i thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of falling,
laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief, with the remainder of
which he lapped me up to the head for further security, and in this
manner carried me home to his house.  there he called his wife, and

sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, i fell on my knees, and
pointing to the boy, made my master to understand, as well as i could,
that i desired his son might be pardoned.  the father complied, and the
lad took his seat again, whereupon i went to him, and kissed his hand,
which my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.

in the midst of dinner, my mistress’s favourite cat leaped into her lap.
i heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers at work;
and turning my head, i found it proceeded from the purring of that
animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as i computed by
the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her mistress was feeding
and stroking her.  the fierceness of this creature’s countenance
altogether discomposed me; though i stood at the farther end of the
table, above fifty feet off; and although my mistress held her fast, for
fear she might give a spring, and seize me in her talons.  b

standing on the table.  this made me reflect upon the fair skins of our
english ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they are of
our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a magnifying
glass; where we find by experiment that the smoothest and whitest skins
look rough, and coarse, and ill-coloured.

i remember when i was at lilliput, the complexion of those diminutive
people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this
subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of
mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he
looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view, when i took
him up in my hand, and brought him close, which he confessed was at first
a very shocking sight.  he said, “he could discover great holes in my
skin; that the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the
bristles of a boar, and my complexion made up of several colou

sleep, i must have infallibly been torn to pieces and devoured.  i
measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it to be two yards long,
wanting an inch; but it went against my stomach to drag the carcass off
the bed, where it lay still bleeding; i observed it had yet some life,
but with a strong slash across the neck, i thoroughly despatched it.

soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, ran
and took me up in her hand.  i pointed to the dead rat, smiling, and
making other signs to show i was not hurt; whereat she was extremely
rejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs,
and throw it out of the window.  then she set me on a table, where i
showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet of my coat,
returned it to the scabbard.  i was pressed to do more than one thing
which another could not do for me, and therefore endeavoured to make my
mistress understand, that i desired to be set down on the floor; which
after she

 had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to express myself
farther, than by pointing to the door, and bowing several times.  the
good woman, with much difficulty, at last perceived what i would be at,
and taking me up again in her hand, walked into the garden, where she set
me down.  i went on one side about two hundred yards, and beckoning to
her not to look or to follow me, i hid myself between two leaves of
sorrel, and there discharged the necessities of nature.

i hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the
like particulars, which, however insignificant they may appear to
groveling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge
his thoughts and imagination, a

washed for me with her own hands.  she was likewise my school-mistress,
to teach me the language: when i pointed to any thing, she told me the
name of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days i was able to call
for whatever i had a mind to.  she was very good-natured, and not above
forty feet high, being little for her age.  she gave me the name of
_grildrig_, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole kingdom.
the word imports what the latins call _nanunculus_, the italians
_homunceletino_, and the english _mannikin_.  to her i chiefly owe my
preservation in that country: we never parted while i was there; i called
her my _glumdalclitch_, or little nurse; and should be guilty of great
ingratitude, if i omitted this honourable mention of her care and
affection towards me, which i heartily wish it lay in my power to requite
as she deserves, instead of being the innocent, but unhappy instrument of

whispering together, sometimes pointing at me; and my fears made me fancy
that i overheard and understood some of their words.  but the next
morning glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which
she had cunningly picked out from her mother.  the poor girl laid me on
her bosom, and fell a weeping with shame and grief.  she apprehended some
mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me
to death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands.  she had
also observed how modest i was in my nature, how nicely i regarded my
honour, and what an indignity i should conceive it, to be exposed for
money as a public spectacle, to the meanest of the people.  she said, her
papa and mamma had promised that grildrig should be hers; but now she
found they meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended
to give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher.
for my own part, i may truly affirm, tha

t i was less concerned than my
nurse.  i had a strong hope, which never left me, that i should one day
recover my liberty: and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a
monster, i considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country, and
that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach, if
ever i should return to england, since the king of great britain himself,
in my condition, must have undergone the same distress.

my master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box the
next market-day to the neighbouring town, and took along with him his
little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him.  the box was close
on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a few
gimlet holes to let in air.  the girl had been so careful as to put the
quilt of her baby’s bed into it, for me to lie down on.

however, i was
terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though it was but of
half an hour: for the horse went about forty feet at every step and
trotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling
of a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent.  our journey was
somewhat farther than from london to st. alban’s.  my master alighted at
an inn which he used to frequent; and after consulting awhile with the
inn-keeper, and making some necessary preparations, he hired the
_grultrud_, or crier, to give notice through the town of a strange
creature to be seen at the sign of the green eagle, not so big as a
_splacnuck_ (an animal in that country very finely shaped, about six feet
long,) and in every part of the body resembling a human creature, could
speak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.

i was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might be
near three hundred feet square.  my littl

fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children (for the country
is very populous;) and my master demanded the rate of a full room
whenever he showed me at home, although it were only to a single family;
so that for some time i had but little ease every day of the week (except
wednesday, which is their sabbath,) although i were not carried to the
town.

my master, finding how profitable i was likely to be, resolved to carry
me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom.  having therefore
provided himself with all things necessary for a long journey, and
settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the 17th
of august, 1703, about two months after my arrival, we set out for the
metropolis, situate near the middle of that empire, and about three
thousand miles distance from our house.  my master made his daughter
glumdalclitch ride behind him.  she carried me on her lap, in a box tied
about her waist.  the girl had lined it on all sides wi

been my instructor while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our
journey.  she carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a
sanson’s atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls,
giving a short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my
letters, and interpreted the words.

the frequent labours i underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a very
considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the more
insatiable he grew.  i had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced
to a skeleton.  the farmer observed it, and concludin

tch, who had always tended
me with so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might
be admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and
instructor.”

her majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer’s consent,
who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor
girl herself was not able to hide her joy.  my late master withdrew,
bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to
which i replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.

the queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of the
apartment, asked me the reason.  i made bold to tell her majesty, “that i
owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not dashing out the
brains of a poor harmless creature, found by chance in his fields: which
obligation was amply recompensed, by the gain he had made in showing me
through half the kingdom, and the price he had now sold me for.  that the
life i had since led was laborious enou

e phoenix of the
creation, so i hoped my late master’s apprehensions would appear to be
groundless; for i already found my spirits revive, by the influence of
her most august presence.”

this was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and
hesitation.  the latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar
to that people, whereof i learned some phrases from glumdalclitch, while
she was carrying me to court.

the queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, was,
however, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an
animal.  she took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was
then retired to his cabinet.  his majesty, a prince of much gravity and
austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view, asked the
queen after a cold manner “how long it was since she grew fond of a
_splacnuck_?” for such it seems he took me to be, as i lay upon my breast
in her majesty’s right hand.  but this princess, who has
 
 ___________________________
 
 an infinite deal
of wit and humour, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire, and
commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which i did in a
very few words: and glumdalclitch who attended at the cabinet door, and
could not endure i should be out of her sight, being admitted, confirmed
all that had passed from my arrival at her father’s house.

the king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions, had
been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly mathematics;
yet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk erect, before i
began to speak, conceived i might be a piece of clock-work (which is in
that country arrived to a very great perfection) contrived by some
ingenious artist.  but when he heard my voice, and found what i delivered
to be regular and rational, he could not conceal his astonishment.  he
was by 
 
 ___________________________
 
no means satisfied with the relation i gave him of the manner i
came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted between
glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me
sell at a better price.  upon this imagination, he put several other
questions to me, and still received rational answers: no otherwise
defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the
language, with some rustic phrases which i had learned at the farmer’s
house, and did not suit the polite style of a court.

his majesty sent for three great scholars, who

bly
do.  one of these virtuosi seemed to think that i might be an embryo, or
abortive birth.  but this opinion was rejected by the other two, who
observed my limbs to be perfect and finished; and that i had lived
several years, as it was manifest from my beard, the stumps whereof they
plainly discovered through a magnifying glass.  they would not allow me
to be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all degrees of
comparison; for the queen’s favourite dwarf, the smallest ever known in
that kingdom, was near thirty feet high.  after much debate, they
concluded unanimously, that i was only _relplum scalcath_, which is
interpreted literally _lusus naturæ_; a determination exactly agreeable
to the modern philosophy of europe, whose professors, disdaining the old
evasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of aristotle endeavoured
in vain to disguise their ignorance, have invented this wonderful
solution of all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human
knowledge.

after th

is decisive conclusion, i entreated to be heard a word or two.  i
applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, “that i came from a
country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my own
stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in proportion,
and where, by consequence, i might be as able to defend myself, and to
find sustenance, as any of his majesty’s subjects could do here; which i
took for a full answer to those gentlemen’s arguments.”  to this they
only replied with a smile of contempt, saying, “that the farmer had
instructed me ve

ry well in my lesson.”  the king, who had a much better
understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by
good fortune was not yet gone out of town.  having therefore first
examined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young
girl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be
true. he desired the queen to order that a particular care should be
taken of me; and was of opinion that glumdalclitch should still continue
in her office of tending me, because he observed we h

ent rats and mice from coming in.  the smith, after several
attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for i have
known a larger at the gate of a gentleman’s house in england.  i made a
shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing glumdalclitch might
lose it.  the queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be
gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an english blanket,
very cumbersome till i was accustomed to them.  they were after the
fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the persian, and partly the
chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.

the queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine without
me.  i had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at
her left elbow, and a chair to sit on.  glumdalclitch stood on a stool on
the floor near my table, to assist and take care of me.  i had an entire
set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in
proportion to those of the queen, were no

ogshead at
a draught.  her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon
the handle.  the spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the
same proportion.  i remember when glumdalclitch carried me, out of
curiosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of
those enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, i thought i had
never till then beheld so terrible a sight.

it is the custom, that every wednesday (which, as i have observed, is
their sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes,
dine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom i was now become a
great favourite; and at these times, my little chair and table were
placed at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars.  this prince
took a pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners,
religion, laws, government, and learning of europe; wherein i gave him
the best account i was able.  his apprehension was so clear, and his
judgment so exact, that he made v

ery wise reflections and observations
upon all i said.  but i confess, that, after i had been a little too
copious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by
sea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the
prejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear
taking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other,
after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, “whether i was a whig or tory?”
then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white
staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the royal sovereign, he observed
“how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by
such diminutive insects as i: and yet,” says he, “i dare engage these
creatures have their titles and distinctions of honour; they contrive
little nests and burrows, that th

and observed every object upon which i cast mine eyes to be of
proportionable magnitude, the horror i had at first conceived from their
bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if i had then beheld a company
of english lords and ladies in their finery and birth-day clothes, acting
their several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting, and bowing,
and prating, to say the truth, i should have been strongly tempted to
laugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me.  neither,
indeed, could i forbear smiling at myself, when the queen used to place
me upon her hand towards a looking-glass, by which both our persons
appeared before me in full view together; and there could be nothing more
ridiculous than the comparison; so that i really began to imagine myself
dwindled many degrees below my usual size.

nothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen’s dwarf; who being
of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (fo

r i verily think
he was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing a
creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger and
look big as he passed by me in the queen’s antechamber, while i was
standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court, and
he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; against which
i could only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging him to
wrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages.
one day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with
something i had said to him, that, raising himself upon the frame of her
majesty’s chair, he took me up by the middle, as i was sitting down, not
thinking any harm, and l

very great satisfaction; for i could not tell to what extremities such a
malicious urchin might have carried his resentment.

he had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,
although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have
immediately cashiered him, if i had not been so generous as to intercede.
her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate, and, after knocking
out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish erect, as it stood
before; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while glumdalclitch was gone
to the side-board, mounted the stool that she stood on to take care of me
at meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs together,
wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist, where i stuck for some
time, and made a very ridiculous figure.  i believe it was near a minute
before any one knew what was become of me; for i thought it below me

cry out.  but, as princes seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not
scalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition.  the dwarf,
at my entreaty, had no other punishment than a sound whipping.

i was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness; and
she used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards
as myself?  the occasion was this: the kingdom is much pestered with
flies in summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as a
dunstable lark, hardly gave me any rest while i sat at dinner, with their
continual humming and buzzing about mine ears.  they would sometimes
alight upon my victuals, and leave their loathsome excrement, or spawn
behind, which to me was very visible, though not to the natives of that
country, whose large optics were not so acute as mine, in viewing smaller
objects.  sometimes they would fix upon my nos

away, and i presently shut my window.  these insects were as large as
partridges: i took out their stings, found them an inch and a half long,
and as sharp as needles.  i carefully preserved them all; and having
since shown them, with some other curiosities, in several parts of
europe, upon my return to england i gave three of them to gresham
college, and kept the fourth for myself.

king’s palace; and some account of the metropolis.  the author’s way of
travelling.  the chief temple described.

i now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, as
far as i travelled in it, which was not above two thousand miles round
lorbrulgrud, the metropolis.  for the queen, whom i always attended,
never went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses, and
there staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers.  the
whole extent of this prince’s

in length, and from three to five in breadth: whence i cannot but
conclude, that our geographers of europe are in a great error, by
supposing nothing but sea between japan and california; for it was ever
my opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the
great continent of tartary; and therefore they ought to correct their
maps and charts, by joining this vast tract of land to the north-west
parts of america, wherein i shall be ready to lend them my assistance.

the kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the north-east by a ridge of
mountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable, by reason
of the volcanoes upon the tops: neither do the most learned know what
sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether they be
inhabited at all.  on the three other sides, it is bounded by the ocean.
there is not one seaport in the whole kingdom: and those parts of the
coasts into which the rivers issue, are so full of pointed rocks, and the
sea general

the production of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is
wholly confined to this continent, of which i leave the reasons to be
determined by philosophers.  however, now and then they take a whale that
happens to be dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on
heartily.  these whales i have known so large, that a man could hardly
carry one upon his shoulders; and sometimes, for curiosity, they are
brought in hampers to lorbrulgrud; i saw one of them in a dish at the
king’s table, which passed for a rarity, but i did not observe he was
fond of it; for i think, indeed, the bigness disgusted him, although i
have seen one somewhat larger in greenland.

the country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, near a
hundred walled towns, and a great number of villages.  to satisfy my
curious reader, it may be sufficient to describe lorbrulgrud.  this city
stands upon almost two equal parts, on each side the river that passes
through.  it contains above eig

hty thousand houses, and about six hundred
thousand inhabitants.  it is in length three _glomglungs_ (which make
about fifty-four english miles,) and two and a half in breadth; as i
measured it myself in the royal map made by the king’s order, which was
laid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: i
paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and,
computing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.

the king’s palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about
seven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty
feet high, and broad and long in proportion.  a coach was allowed to
glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to
see the town, or go among the shops; and i was always of the party,
carried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often take
me out, and hold me in her hand, that i might more conveniently view the
houses an

velling-closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of
three of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on the
outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys.  on the fourth side,
which had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the
person that carried me, when i had a mind to be on horseback, put a
leathern belt, and buckled it about his waist.  this was always the
office of some grave trusty servant, in whom i could confide, whether i
attended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see
the gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in
the court, when glumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for i soon
began to be known and esteemed among the greatest officers, i suppose
more upon account of their majesties’ favour, than any merit of my own.
in journeys, when i was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would
buckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before him; and there i had

lumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open
sedan, after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended
by two others in the queen’s livery.  the people, who had often heard of
me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was
complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand,
that i might be more conveniently seen.

i was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower
belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.
accordingly one day my nurse carried me thither, but i may truly say i
came back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand feet,
reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which, allowing
for the difference between the size of those people and us in europe, is
no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in proportion (if i
rightly remember) to salisbury steeple.  but, not to detract from a
nation, to which, during my life, i shall acknowledge myself extremely

square, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors, cut
in marble, larger than the life, placed in their several niches.  i
measured a little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues,
and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found it exactly four feet
and an inch in length.  glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief,
and carried it home in her pocket, to keep among other trinkets, of which
the girl was very fond, as children at her age usually are.

the king’s kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and about
six hundred feet high.  the great oven is not so wide, by ten paces, as
the cupola at st. paul’s: for i measured the latter on purpose, after my
return.  but if i should describe the kitchen grate, the prodigious pots
and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the spits, with many other
particulars, perhaps i should be hardly believed; at least a severe
critic would be apt to think i enlarged a little, as travellers are often

uspected to do.  to avoid which censure i fear i have run too much into
the other extreme; and that if this treatise should happen to be
translated into the language of brobdingnag (which is the general name of
that kingdom,) and transmitted thither, the king and his people would
have reason to complain that i had done them an injury, by a false and
diminutive representation.

his majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables: they
are generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high.  but, when he goes
abroad on solemn days, he is attended, for state, by a military guard of
five hundred horse, which, indeed, i thought was the most splendid sight
that could be ever beheld, till i saw part of his army in battalia,

ourt in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me out
of it, and hold me in her hand, or set me down to walk.  i remember,
before the dwarf left the queen, he followed us one day into those
gardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and i being close together,
near some dwarf apple trees, i must needs show my wit, by a silly
allusion between him and the trees, which happens to hold in their
language as it does in ours.  whereupon, the malicious rogue, watching
his opportunity, when i was walking under one of them, shook it directly
over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of them near as large as a
bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; one of them hit me on the
back as i chanced to stoop, and knocked me down flat on my face; but i
received no other hurt, and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire, because
i had given the provocation.

another day, glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert
myself, while she walked at some distance with her governess.  in the
meantime

in a secure place (which i often
entreated her to do, that i might enjoy my own thoughts,) and having left
my box at home, to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went to another part
of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance.
while she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel that
belonged to one of the chief gardeners, having got by accident into the
garden, happened to range near the place where i lay: the dog, following
the scent, came directly up, and taking me in his mouth, ran straight to
his master wagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground.  by good
fortune he had been so well taught, that i was carried between his teeth
without the least hurt, or even tearing my clothes.  but the poor
gardener, who knew me well, and had a great kindness for me, was in a
terrible fright: he gently took me up in both his hands, and asked me how
i did? but i was so amazed and out of breath, that i could not speak a
word.  in a few minutes i came to myself,

hould go about.

this accident absolutely determined glumdalclitch never to trust me
abroad for the future out of her sight.  i had been long afraid of this
resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky
adventures, that happened in those times when i was left by myself.  once
a kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if i had not
resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier, he would have
certainly carried me away in his talons.  another time, walking to the
top of a fresh mole-hill, i fell to my neck in the hole, through which
that animal had cast up the earth, and coined some lie, not worth
remembering, to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes.  i likewise broke
my right shin against the shell of a snail, which i happened to stumble
over, as i was walking alone and thinking on poor england.

i cannot tell whether i were more pleased or mortified to observe, in
those solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all

of me, but would hop about within a yard’s distance, looking for
worms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if no
creature at all were near them.  i remember, a thrush had the confidence
to snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a of cake that glumdalclitch had
just given me for my breakfast.  when i attempted to catch any of these
birds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavouring to peck my
fingers, which i durst not venture within their reach; and then they
would hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or snails, as they did

strength so luckily, at a linnet, that i knocked him down, and seizing
him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse.
however, the bird, who had only been stunned, recovering himself gave me
so many boxes with his wings, on both sides of my head and body, though i
held him at arm’s-length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that i
was twenty times thinking to let him go.  but i was soon relieved by one
of our servants, who wrung off the bird’s neck, and i had him next day
for dinner, by the queen’s command.  this linnet, as near as i can
remember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an english swan.

the maids of honour often invited glumdalclitch to their apartments, and
desired she would bring me along with her, on purpose to have the
pleasure of seeing and touching me.  they would often strip me naked from
top to toe, and lay me at full leng

first-rate man of war among us; and such a boat as i could manage would
never live in any of their rivers.  her majesty said, if i would contrive
a boat, her own joiner should make it, and she would provide a place for
me to sail in.  the fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my
instructions, in ten days, finished a pleasure-boat with all its
tackling, able conveniently to hold eight europeans.  when it was
finished, the queen was so delighted, that she ran with it in her lap to
the king, who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water, with me
in it, by way of trial, where i could not manage my two sculls, or little
oars, for want of room.  but the queen had before contrived another
project.  she ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred
feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep; which, being well pitched, to
prevent leaking, was placed on the floor, along the wall, in an outer
room of the palace.  it had a cock near the bottom to let out the water,
when i

litch always carried
back my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.

in this exercise i once met an accident, which had like to have cost me
my life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the
governess who attended glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to
place me in the boat: but i happened to slip through her fingers, and
should infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the
luckiest chance in the world, i had not been stopped by a corking-pin
that stuck in the good gentlewoman’s stomacher; the head of the pin
passing between my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and thus i was
held by the middle in the air, till glumdalclitch ran to my relief.

another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough
every third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a huge frog
(not perceiving it) slip out of his pail.  the frog lay concealed till i
was put into my boat, but then, seeing a resting-place, climbed

, to prevent overturning.  when the frog was
got in, it hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my
head, backward and forward, daubing my face and clothes with its odious
slime.  the largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed
animal that can be conceived.  however, i desired glumdalclitch to let me
deal with it alone.  i banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and
at last forced it to leap out of the boat.

but the greatest danger i ever underwent in that kingdom, was from a
monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.  glumdalclitch
had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business,
or a visit.  the weather being very warm, the closet-window was left
open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which i
usually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency.  as i sat
quietly meditating at my table, i heard something bounce in at the
closet-window, and skip about from one side to the other: whereat

,
although i was much alarmed, yet i ventured to look out, but not stirring
from my seat; and then i saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping
up and down, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with
great pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window.  i
retreated to the farther corner of my room; or box; but the monkey
looking in at every side, put me in such a fright, that i wanted presence
of mind to conceal myself under the bed, as i might easily have done.
after some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last
espied me; and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat does
when she plays with a mouse, although i often shifted place to avoid him,
he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made of that
country silk, was very thick and strong), and dragged me out.  he took me
up in

his right fore-foot and held me as a nurse does a child she is
going to suckle, just as i have seen the same sort of creature do with a
kitten in europe; and when i offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard,
that i thought it more prudent to submit.  i have good reason to believe,
that he took me for a young one of his own species, by his often stroking
my face very gently with his other paw.  in these diversions he was
interrupted by a noise at the closet door, as if somebody were opening
it: whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come
in, and thence upon the leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and
holding me in the fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to
ours.  i heard glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying
me out.  the poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the pala

to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse’s footmen, climbed up,
and putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down safe.

i was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my
throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small
needle, and then i fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief.  yet i
was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this
odious animal, that i was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.  the king,
queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my health; and
her majesty made me several visits during my sickness.  the monkey was
killed, and an order made, that no such animal should be kept about the
palace.

when i attended the king after my recovery, to return him thanks for his
favours, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure.  he
asked me, “what my thoughts and speculations were, while i lay in the
monkey’s paw; how i liked the victuals he gave me; hi

ch.”  he
desired to know, “what i would have done upon such an occasion in my own
country.”  i told his majesty, “that in europe we had no monkeys, except
such as were brought for curiosity from other places, and so small, that
i could deal with a dozen of them together, if they presumed to attack
me.  and as for that monstrous animal with whom i was so lately engaged
(it was indeed as large as an elephant), if my fears had suffered me to
think so far as to make use of my hanger,” (looking fiercely, and
clapping my hand on the hilt, as i spoke) “when he poked his paw into my
chamber, perhaps i should have given him such a wound, as would have made
him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it in.”  this i
delivered in a firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage
should be called in question.  however, my speech produced nothing else
beside a laud laughter, which all the respect due to his majesty from
those about him could not make them contain.  this

made me reflect, how
vain an attempt it is for a man to endeavour to do himself honour among
those who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him.  and
yet i have seen the moral of my own behaviour very frequent in england
since my return; where a little contemptible varlet, without the least
title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look with
importance, and put himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the
kingdom.

i was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story: and
glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to
inform the queen, whenever i committed any folly that she thought would
be diverting to her majesty.  the girl, who had been out of order, was
carried by her governess to take the air about an hour’s distance, or
thirty miles from town.  they alighted out of the coach near a small
foot-path in a field, and glumdalclitch setting down my travelling box

unfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the middle up to my
knees.  i waded through with some difficulty, and one of the footmen
wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief, for i was filthily
bemired; and my nurse confined me to my box, till we returned home; where
the queen was soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it
about the court: so that all the mirth for some days was at my expense.

which the author relates to him.  the king’s observations thereon.

i used to attend the king’s levee once or twice a week, and had often
seen him under the barber’s hand, which indeed was at first very terrible
to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe.
his majesty, according to the custom of the country, was only shaved
twice a-week.  i once prevailed on the barber to giv

e me some of the suds
or lather, out of which i picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps
of hair.  i then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it like the back of a
comb, making several holes in it at equal distances with as small a
needle as i could get from glumdalclitch.  i fixed in the stumps so
artificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife toward the points,
that i made a very tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own
being so much broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither
did i know any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would
undertake to make me another.

and this puts me in mind of an amusement, wherein i spent many
 
 ___________________________
 
 of my body on those precious hairs, that once
adorned her majesty’s head.  of these hairs (as i had always a mechanical
genius) i likewise made a neat little purse, about five feet long, with
her majesty’s name deciphered in gold letters, which i gave to
glumdalclitch, by the queen’s consent.  to say the truth, it was more for
show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger
coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that
girls are fond of.

the king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to
which i was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear them:
but the noise was so great that i could hardly distinguish the tunes.  i
am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army, beating and
sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it.  my practice was
to have my box removed from the place where the performers sat, as far as
i could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and draw the window

curtains; after which i found their music not disagreeable.

i had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.
glumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a-week
to teach her: i called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that
instrument, and was played upon in the same manner.  a fancy came into my
head, that i would entertain the king and queen with an english tune upon
this instrument.  but this appeared extremely difficult: for the spinet
was near sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide, so that with
my arms extended i could not reach to above five keys, and to press them
down required a good smart stroke with my fist, which would be too great
a labour, and to no purpose.  the method i contrived was this: i prepared
two round sticks, about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker
at one end than the othe

ench was
placed, about four feet below the keys, and i was put upon the bench.  i
ran sideling upon it, that way and this, as fast as i could, banging the
proper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a jig, to the
great satisfaction of both their majesties; but it was the most violent
exercise i ever underwent; and yet i could not strike above sixteen keys,
nor consequently play the bass and treble together, as other artists do;
which was a great disadvantage to my performance.

the king, who, as i before observed, was a prince of excellent
understanding, would frequently order that i should be brought in my box,
and set upon the table in his closet: he would then command me to bring
one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards distance
upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a level with his
face.  in this manner i had several conversations with him.  i one day
took the freedom to tell his majesty, “that the contempt he discovered
towards

did not seem answerable to
those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of; that reason did
not extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary, we observed
in our country, that the tallest persons were usually the least provided
with it; that among other animals, bees and ants had the reputation of
more industry, art, and sagacity, than many of the larger kinds; and
that, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, i hoped i might live to do
his majesty some signal service.”  the king heard me with attention, and
began to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before.
he desired “i would give him as exact an account of the government of
england as i possibly could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of
their own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former
discourses), he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve
imitation.”

imagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often i then wished for the
tongue of demosthenes o

the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits
and felicity.

i began my discourse by informing his majesty, that our dominions
consisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under one
sovereign, beside our plantations in america.  i dwelt long upon the
fertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate.  i then spoke
at large upon the constitution of an english parliament; partly made up
of an illustrious body called the house of peers; persons of the noblest
blood, and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies.  i described that
extraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms, to
qualify them for being counsellors both to the king a

conduct, and fidelity.  that these were the ornament and bulwark of the
kingdom, worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors, whose honour
had been the reward of their virtue, from which their posterity were
never once known to degenerate.  to these were joined several holy
persons, as part of that assembly, under the title of bishops, whose
peculiar business is to take care of religion, and of those who instruct
the people therein.  these were searched and sought out through the whole
nation, by the prince and his wisest counsellors, among such of the

millions there might be of each religious sect, or political party among
us.  i did not omit even our sports and pastimes, or any other particular
which i thought might redound to the honour of my country.  and i
finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events in
england for about a hundred years past.

this conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several
hours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently
taking notes of what i spoke, as well as memorandums of what questions he
intended to ask me.

when i had put an end to these long discources, his majesty, in a sixth
audience, consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries, and
objections, upon every article.  he asked, “what methods were used to
cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind of
business they commonly spent the first and teachable parts of their

ment of our treasury; and said, “he thought
my memory had failed me, because i computed our taxes at about five or
six millions a-year, and when i came to mention the issues, he found they
sometimes amounted to more than double; for the notes he had taken were
very particular in this point, because he hoped, as he told me, that the
knowledge of our conduct might be useful to him, and he could not be
deceived in his calculations.  but, if what i told him were true, he was
still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate, like a private
person.”  he asked me, “who were our creditors; and where we found money
to pay them?”  he wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and
expensive wars; “that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live
among very bad neighbours, and that our generals must needs be richer
than our kings.”  he asked, what business we had out of our own islands,
unless upon the score of trade, or treaty, or to defend the coasts with
our fleet?”

e historical account gave him of our
affairs during the last century; protesting “it was only a heap of
conspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions, banishments,
the very worst effects that avarice, faction, hypocrisy, perfidiousness,
cruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust, malice, and ambition, could
produce.”

his majesty, in another audience, was at the pains to recapitulate the
sum of all i had spoken; compared the questions he made with the answers
i had given; then taking me into his hands, and stroking me gently,
delivered himself in these words, which i shall never forget, nor the
manner he spoke them in: “my little friend grildrig, you have made a most
admirable panegyric upon your country; you have clearly proved, that
ignorance, idleness, and vice, are the proper ingredients for qualifying
a legislator; that laws are best explained, interpreted, and applied, by
those whose interest and abilities lie in perverting, confounding, and
eluding them.  i observe

the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions.  it does not appear,
from all you have said, how any one perfection is required toward the
procurement of any one station among you; much less, that men are
ennobled on account of their virtue; that priests are advanced for their
piety or learning; soldiers, for their conduct or valour; judges, for
their integrity; senators, for the love of their country; or counsellors
for their wisdom.  as for yourself,” continued the king, “who have spent
the greatest part of your life in travelling, i am well disposed to hope
you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country.  but by what i
have gathered from your own relation, and the answers i have with much
pains wrung and extorted from you, i cannot but conclude the bulk of your
natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that
nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.”

to the king, which is rejected.  the king’s great ignorance in politics.
the learning of that country very imperfect and confined.  the laws, and
military affairs, and parties in the state.

nothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from
concealing this part of my story.  it was in vain to discover my
resentments, which were always turned into ridicule; and i was forced to
rest with patience, while my noble and beloved country was so injuriously
treated.  i am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be,

, than the strictness
of truth would allow.  for i have always borne that laudable partiality
to my own country, which dionysius halicarnassensis, with so much
justice, recommends to an historian: i would hide the frailties and
deformities of my political mother, and place her virtues and beauties in
the most advantageous light.  this was my sincere endeavour in those many
discourses i had with that monarch, although it unfortunately failed of
success.

but great allowances should be given to a king, who lives wholly secluded
from the rest of the world, and must therefore be altogether unacquainted
with the manners and customs that most prevail in other nations: the want
of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices, and a certain
narrowness of thinking, from which we, and the politer countries of
europe, are wholly exempted.  and it would be hard indeed, if so remote a
prince’s notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a standard for
all mankind.

ingredients very well, which were cheap and common; i understood the
manner of compounding them, and could direct his workmen how to make

majesty’s kingdom, and the largest need not be above a hundred feet long;
twenty or thirty of which tubes, charged with the proper quantity of
powder and balls, would batter down the walls of the strongest town in
his dominions in a few hours, or destroy the whole metropolis, if ever it
should pretend to dispute his absolute commands.”  this i humbly offered
to his majesty, as a small tribute of acknowledgment, in turn for so many
marks that i had received, of his royal favour and protection.

“could entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner, as to
appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which i
had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines;
whereof,” he said, “some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must have been
the first contriver.  as for himself, he protested, that although few
things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature, yet
he would rather lose half his kingdom, than be privy to such a secret;
which he commanded me, as i valued any life, never to mention any more.”

a strange effect of narrow principles and views! that a prince possessed
of every quality which procures veneration, love, and esteem; of strong
parts, great wisdom, and profound learning, endowed with admirable
talents, and almost adored by his subjects, should, from a nice,
unnecessary scruple, whereof in europe we can have no conception, let
slip an opportunity put into his hands t

neither do i say this, with the least intention to detract from the many
virtues of that excellent king, whose character, i am sensible, will, on
this account, be very much lessened in the opinion of an english reader:
but i take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance, by
not having hitherto reduced politics into a science, as the more acute
wits of europe have done.  for, i remember very well, in a discourse one
day with the king, when i happened to say, “there were several thousand
books among us written upon the art of government,” it gave him (directly

and simple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial enough to
discover above one interpretation: and to write a comment upon any law,

against criminals, their precedents are so few, that they have little
reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either.

they have had the art of printing, as well as the chinese, time out of
mind: but their libraries are not very large; for that of the king, which
is reckoned the largest, does not amount to above a thousand volumes,
placed in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long, whence i had liberty to
borrow what books i pleased.  the queen’s joiner had contrived in one of
glumdalclitch’s rooms, a kind of wooden machine five-and-twenty feet
high, formed like a standing ladder; the steps were each fifty feet long.

paces, according to the length of the lines, till i had gotten a little
below the level of mine eyes, and then descending gradually till i came
to the bottom: after which i mounted again, and began the other page in
the same manner, and so turned over the leaf, which i could easily do
with both my hands, for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard, and in
the largest folios not above eighteen or twenty feet long.

ndustry.”  he added, “that nature
was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and could
now produce only small abortive births, in comparison of those in ancient
times.”  he said “it was very reasonable to think, not only that the
species of men were originally much larger, but also that there must have
been giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by history and
tradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually
dug up in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled
race of men in our days.”  he argued, “that the very laws of nature
absolutely required we should have been made, in the beginning of a size
more large and robust; not so liable to destruction from every little
accident, of a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand
of a boy, or being drowned in a little brook.”  from this way of
reasoning, the author drew several moral applications, useful in the
conduct of life, but needless here to

repeat.  for my own part, i could
not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of drawing
lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining,
from the quarrels we raise with nature.  and i believe, upon a strict
inquiry, those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded among us as they
are among that people.

as to their military affairs, they boast that the king’s army consists of
a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two thousand horse:
if that may be called an army, which is made up of tradesmen in the
several cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are only the
nobility and gentry, without pay or reward.  they are indeed perfect
enough in their exercises, and under very good discipline, wherein i saw
no great merit; for how should it be otherwise, where every farmer is
under the command of his own landlord, and every cit

i was curious to know how this prince, to whose dominions there is no
access from any other country, came to think of armies, or to teach his
people the practice of military discipline.  but i was soon informed,
both by conversation and reading their histories; for, in the course of
many ages, they have been troubled with the same disease to which the
whole race of mankind is subject; the nobility often contending for
power, the people for liberty, and the king for absolute dominion.  all
which, however happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom, have been
sometimes violated by each of the three parties, and have more than once
occasioned civil wars; the last whereof was happily put an end to by this
prince’s grand-father, in a general composition; and the militia, then
settled with common consent, has been ever since kept in the strictest
duty.

i had always a strong impulse that i should some time recover my liberty,
though it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to form any
project with the least hope of succeeding.  the ship in which i sailed,
was the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast, and the
king had given strict orders, that if at any time another appeared, it
should be taken ashore, and with all its crew and passengers brought in a
tumbril to lorbrulgrud.  he was strongly bent to get me a woman of my own
size, by whom i might propagate the breed: but i think i should rather
have died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept
in cages, like tame canary-birds, and perhaps, in time, sold about the
kingdom, to persons of quality, for curiosities.  i was indeed treated

with much kindness: i was the favourite of a great king and queen, and
the delight of the whole court; but it was upon such a foot as ill became
the dignity of humankind.  i could never forget those domestic pledges i
had left behind me.  i wanted to be among people, with whom i could
converse upon even terms, and walk about the streets and fields without
being afraid of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy.  but my
deliverance came sooner than i expected, and in a manner not very common;
the whole story and circumstances of which i shal

l faithfully relate.

i had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of the
third, glumdalclitch and i attended the king and queen, in a progress to
the south coast of the kingdom.  i was carried, as usual, in my
travelling-box, which as i have already described, was a very convenient
closet, of twelve feet wide.  and i had ordered a hammock to be fixed, by
silken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break the jolts, when a
servant carried me before him on horseback, as i sometimes desired; and
would often sleep in my hammock, while we were upon the road.  on the
roof of my closet, not directly over the middle of the hammock, i ordered
the joiner to cut out a ho

le of a foot square, to give me air in hot
weather, as i slept; which hole i shut at pleasure with a board that drew
backward and forward through a groove.

when we came to our journey’s end, the king thought proper to pass a few
days at a palace he has near flanflasnic, a city within eighteen english
miles of the seaside.  glumdalclitch and i were much fatigued: i had
gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to
her chamber.  i longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of
my escape, if ever it should happen.  i pretended to be worse than i
really was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a
page, whom i was very fond of, and who had s

oy took me out in my box, about
half an hours walk from the palace, towards the rocks on the sea-shore.
i ordered him to set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many
a wistful melancholy look towards the sea.  i found myself not very well,
and told the page that i had a mind to take a nap in my hammock, which i
hoped would do me good.  i got in, and the boy shut the window close
down, to keep out the cold.  i soon fell asleep, and all i can conjecture
is, while i slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among
the rocks to look for birds’ eggs, having before observed him from my
window searching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts.  be that
as it will, i found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the
ring, which was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of
carriage.  i felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne
forward with prodigious speed.  the first jolt had like to have shaken me
out of my hammock, but afterward t

d when they had got all they had a mind for, let the hull
drop into the sea, which by reason of many breaches made in the bottom
and sides, sunk to rights.  and, indeed, i was glad not to have been a
spectator of the havoc they made, because i am confident it would have
sensibly touched me, by bringing former passages into my mind, which i
would rather have forgot.

i slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place i
had left, and the dangers i had escaped.  however, upon waking, i found
myself much recovered.  it was now about eight o’clock at night, and the
captain ordered supper immediately, thinking i had already fasted too
long.  he entertained me with great kindness, observing me not to look
wildly, or talk inconsistently: and, when we were left alone, desired i
would give him a relation of my travels, and by what accident i came to
be set adrift, in that monstrous wooden chest.  he said “that about

was immediately convinced of my candour and veracity.  but further to
confirm all i had said, i entreated him to give order that my cabinet
should be brought, of which i had the key in my pocket; for he had
already informed me how the seamen disposed of my closet.  i opened it in
his own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities i made
in the country from which i had been so strangely delivered.  there was
the comb i had contrived out of the stumps of the king’s beard, and
another of the same materials, but fixed into a paring of her majesty’s
thumb-nail, which served for the back.  there was a collection of needles
and pins, from a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings, like
joiner’s tacks; some combings of the queen’s hair; a gold ring, which one
day she made me a present of, in a most obliging manner, taking it from
her little finger, and throwing it over my head like a collar.  i desired
the captain would please to accept this ring i

glumdalclitch’s men, who was afflicted with the tooth-ache, but it was as

it was about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.

the captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation i had given
him, and said, “he hoped, when we returned to england, i would oblige the
world by putting it on paper, and making it public.”  my answer was,
“that we were overstocked with books of travels: that nothing could now
pass which was not extraordinary; wherein i doubted some authors less
consulted truth, than their own vanity, or interest, or the diversion of
ignorant readers; that my story could contain little beside common
events, without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants, trees,
birds, and other animals; or of the barbarous customs and idolatry of
savage people, with which most writers abou

for his good opinion, and promised to take the matter into my thoughts.”

he said “he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to hear me speak
so loud;” asking me “whether the king or queen of that country were thick
of hearing?”  i told him, “it was what i had been used to for above two
years past, and that i admired as much at the voices of him and his men,
who seemed to me only to whisper, and yet i could hear them well enough.
but, when i spoke in that country, it was like a man talking in the
streets, to another looking out from the top of a steeple, unless when i
was placed on a table, or held in any person’s hand.”  i told him, “i had

as i was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the trees,
the cattle, and the people, i began to think myself in lilliput.  i was
afraid of trampling on every traveller i met, and often called aloud to
have them stand out of the way, so that i had like to have gotten one or
two broken heads for my impertinence.

when i came to my own house, for which i was forced to inquire, one of
the servants opening the door, i bent down to go in, (like a goose under
a gate,) for fear of striking my head.  my wife run out to embrace me,
but i stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise never be
able to reach my mouth.  my daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but i
could not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with
my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then i went to take her
up with one hand by the waist.  i looked down upon the servants, and one
or two friends who were in the house, as if they had been pigmies and i a

he had always treated me more like a brother, than an inferior officer;
and, hearing of my arrival, made me a visit, as i apprehended only out of
friendship, for nothing passed more than what is usual after long
absences.  but repeating his visits often, expressing his joy to find i
me in good health, asking, “whether i were now settled for life?” adding,
“that he intended a voyage to the east indies in two months,” at last he
plainly invited me, though with some apologies, to be surgeon of the
ship; “that i should have another surgeon under me, beside our two mates;
that my salary should be double to the usual pay; and that having
experienced my knowledge in sea-affairs to be at least equal to his, he
would enter into any engagement to follow my advice, as much as if i had

injurious terms his language could afford.

about an hour before we saw the pirates i had taken an observation, and
found we were in the latitude of 46 n. and longitude of 183.  when i was
at some distance from the pirates, i discovered, by my pocket-glass,
several islands to the south-east.  i set up my sail, the wind being
fair, with a design to reach the nearest of those islands, which i made a
shift to do, in about three hours.  it was all rocky: however i got many
birds’ eggs; and, striking fire, i kindled some heath and dry sea-weed,
by which i roasted my eggs.  i ate no other supper, being resolved to
spare my provisions as much as i could.  i passed the night under the
shelter of a rock, strewing some heath under me, and slept pretty well.

the next day i sailed to another island, and thence to a third and
fourth, sometimes using my sail, and sometimes my paddles.  but, not to
trouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses, let it
suffice, that on the fifth day i

ressive motion, as they
pleased.  but not being at that time in a disposition to philosophise
upon this phenomenon, i rather chose to observe what course the island
would take, because it seemed for awhile to stand still.  yet soon after,
it advanced nearer, and i could see the sides of it encompassed with
several gradations of galleries, and stairs, at certain intervals, to
descend from one to the other.  in the lowest gallery, i beheld some
people fishing with long angling rods, and others looking on.  i waved my
cap (for my hat was long since worn out) and my handkerchief toward the
island; and upon its nearer approach, i called and shouted with the
utmost strength of my voice; and then looking circumspectly, i beheld a
crowd gather to that side which was most in my view.  i found by their
pointing towards me and to each other, that they plainly discovered me,
although they made no return to my shouting.  but i could see four or
five men running in great haste, up the stairs, to the top

.

the number of people increased, and, in less than half all hour, the
island was moved and raised in such a manner, that the lowest gallery
appeared in a parallel of less then a hundred yards distance from the
height where i stood.  i then put myself in the most supplicating
posture, and spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer.  those
who stood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of distinction,
as i supposed by their habit.  they conferred earnestly with each other,
looking often upon me.  at length one of them called out in a clear,
polite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the italian: and therefore
i returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence
might be more agreeable to his ears.  although neither of us understood
the other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the
distress i was in.

they made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the
shore, which i accordingly did; and the flying island being rai

at my alighting, i was surrounded with a crowd of people, but those who
stood nearest seemed to be of better quality.  they beheld me with all
the marks and circumstances of wonder; neither indeed was i much in their
debt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their
shapes, habits, and countenances.  their heads were all reclined, either

ducted me up the stairs to the top of the island, and
from thence to the royal palace.  while we were ascending, they forgot
several times what they were about, and left me to myself, till their
memories were again roused by their flappers; for they appeared
altogether unmoved by the sight of my foreign habit and countenance, and
by the shouts of the vulgar, whose thoughts and minds were more
disengaged.

at last we entered the palace, and proceeded into the chamber of
presence, where i saw the king seated on his throne, attended on each
side by persons of prime quality.  before the throne, was a large table
filled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all
kinds.  his majesty took not the least notice of us, although our
entrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all
persons belonging to the court.  but he was then deep in a problem; and
we attended at least an hour, before he could solve it.  there stood by
him, on each side, a young page with flaps

in their hands, and when they
saw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck his mouth, and the other
his right ear; at which he startled like one awaked on the sudden, and
looking towards me and the company i was in, recollected the occasion of
our coming, whereof he had been informed before.  he spoke some words,
whereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side, and
flapped me gently on the right ear; but i made signs, as well as i could,
that i had no occasion for such an instrument; which, as i afterwards
found, gave his majesty, and the whole court, a very mean opinion of my
understanding.  the king, as far as i could conjecture, asked me several
ques

tions, and i addressed myself to him in all the languages i had.
when it was found i could neither understand nor be understood, i was
conducted by his order to an apartment in his palace (this prince being
distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to
strangers), where two servants were appointed to attend me.  my dinner
was brought, and four persons of quality, whom i remembered to have seen
very near the king’s person, did me the honour to dine with me.  we had
two courses, of three dishes each.  in the first course, there was a
shoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef into
a rhomboides, and a pudding into a cycloid.  the second course was two
ducks trussed up in the form of fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling
flutes and hautboys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp.  the
servants cut our bread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several
other mathe

matical figures.

while we were at dinner, i made bold to ask the names of several things
in their language, and those noble persons, by the assistance of their
flappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration of
their great abilities if i could be brought to converse with them.  i was
soon able to call for bread and drink, or whatever else i wanted.

after dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the
king’s order, attended by a flapper.  he brought with him pen, ink, and
paper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs, that he
was sent to teach me the language.  we sat together four hours, in which
time i wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the
translations over against them; i likewise made a shift to learn several
short sentences; for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch
something, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or to stand, or walk,

bsolete language, signifies high; and _untuh_, a
governor; from which they say, by corruption, was derived _laputa_, from
_lapuntuh_.  but i do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a
little strained.  i ventured to offer to the learned among them a
conjecture of my own, that laputa was _quasi lap outed_; _lap_,
signifying properly, the dancing of the sunbeams in the sea, and _outed_,
a wing; which, however, i shall not obtrude, but submit to the judicious
reader.

those to whom the king had entrusted me, observing how ill i was clad,
ordered a tailor to come next morning, and take measure for a suit of
clothes.  this operator did his office after a different manner from
those of his trade in europe.  he first took my altitude by a quadrant,
and then, with a rule and compasses, described the dimensions and
outlines of my whole body, all which he entered upon paper; and in six
days brought my clothes very ill made, and quite out of shape, by
happening to mistake a figure in the

calculation.  but my comfort was,
that i observed such accidents very frequent, and little regarded.

during my confinement for want of clothes, and by an indisposition that
held me some days longer, i much enlarged my dictionary; and when i went
next to court, was able to understand many things the king spoke, and to
return him some kind of answers.  his majesty had given orders, that the
island should move north-east and by east, to the vertical point over
lagado, the metropolis of the whole kingdom below, upon the firm earth.
it was about ninety leagues distant, and our voyage lasted four days and
a half.  i was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made
in the air by the island.  on the second morning, about eleven o’clock,
the king himself in person, attended by his nobility, courtiers, and
officers, having prepared all their musical instruments, played on them
for three hours without intermission, so that i was quite stunned with
the noise; neither could i possibly g

the knowledge i had in mathematics, gave me great assistance in acquiring
their phraseology, which depended much upon that science, and music; and
in the latter i was not unskilled.  their ideas are perpetually
conversant in lines and figures.  if they would, for example, praise the
beauty of a woman, or any other animal, they describe it by rhombs,
circles, parallelograms, ellipses, and other geometrical terms, or by
words of art drawn from music, needless here to repeat.  i observed in
the king’s kitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments,
after the figures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his
majesty’s table.

their houses are very ill built, the walls bevil, without one right angle
in any apartment; and this defect arises from the contempt they bear to
practical geometry, which they despise as vulgar and mechanic; those
instructions they give being too refined for the intellects of their
workmen, which occasions perpetual mistakes.  and although

the wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island, although
i think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world; and although
they live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence, and are allowed
to do whatever they please, they long to see the world, and take the
diversions of the metropolis, which they are not allowed to do without a
particular license from the king; and this is not easy to be obtained,
because the people of quality have found, by frequent experience, how
hard it is to persuade their women to return from below.  i was told that
a great court lady, who had several children,—is married to the prime
minister, the richest subject in the kingdom, a very graceful person,
extremely fond of her, and lives in the finest palace of the island,—went
down to lagado on the pretence of health, there hid herself for several
months, till the king sent

this may perhaps pass with the reader rather for an european or english
story, than for one of a country so remote.  but he may please to
consider, that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate
or nation, and that they are much more uniform, than can be easily
imagined.

in about a month’s time, i had made a tolerable proficiency in their
language, and was able to answer most of the king’s questions, when i had
the honour to attend him.  his majesty discovered not the least curiosity
to inquire into the laws, government, history, religion, or manners of
the countries where i had been; but confined his questions to the state
of mathematics, and received the account i gave him with great contempt
and indifference, though often roused by his flapper on each side.

insurrections.

i desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island,
which he was graciously pleased to grant, and ordered my tutor to attend
me.  i chiefly wanted to know, to what cause, in art or in nature, it
owed its several motions, whereof i will now give a philosophical account
to the reader.

the flying or floating island is exactly circular, its diameter 7837
yards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten
thousand acres.

 cannot move beyond the extent
of the dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of four miles.
for which the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning the
stone) assign the following reason: that the magnetic virtue does not
extend beyond the distance of four miles, and that the mineral, which
acts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea about six
leagues distant from the shore, is not diffused through the whole globe,
but terminated with the limits of the king’s dominions; and it was easy,
from the great advantage of such a superior situation, for a prince to
bring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of
that magnet.

when the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island
stands still; for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal
distance from the earth, act with equal force, the one in drawing
downwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion can
ensue.

this loadstone is under

they have observed ninety-three different comets, and settled their
periods with great exactness.  if this be true (and they affirm it with
great confidence) it is much to be wished, that their observations were
made public, whereby the theory of comets, which at present is very lame
and defective, might be brought to the same perfection with other arts of
astronomy.

the king would be the most absolute prince in the universe, if he could
but prevail on a ministry to join with him; but these having their
estates below on the continent, and considering that the office of a
favourite has a very uncertain tenure, would never consent to the
enslaving of their country.

if any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny, fall into violent
factions, or refuse to pay the usual tribute, the king has two methods of
reducing them to obedience.  the first and the mildest course i

proceeds to the last remedy, by letting the island drop directly upon
their heads, which makes a universal destruction both of houses and men.
however, this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom driven,
neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution; nor dare his
ministers advise him to an action, which, as it would render them odious
to the people, so it would be a great damage to their own estates, which
all lie below; for the island is the king’s demesne.

but there is still indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of this
country have been always averse from executing so terrible an action,
unless upon the utmost necessity.  for, if the town intended to be
destroyed should have in it any tall rocks, as it generally falls out in
the larger cities, a situation probably chosen at first with a view to
prevent such a catastrophe; or if it abound in high spires, or pillars of
stone, a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under sur

face of the
island, which, although it consist, as i have said, of one entire
adamant, two hundred yards thick, might happen to crack by too great a
shock, or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below,
as the backs, both of iron and stone, will often do in our chimneys.  of
all this the people are well apprised, and understand how far to carry
their obstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned.  and the
king, when he is highest provoked, and most determined to press a city to
rubbish, orders the island to descend with great gentleness, out of a
pretence of tenderness to his people, but, indeed, for fear of breaking
the adamantine bottom; in which case, it is the opinion of all their
philosophers, that the loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the
whole mass would fall to the ground.

by a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king, nor either of his
two eldest sons, are permitted to leave

court-pages, during two months of my abode there; by which, at last, i
rendered myself extremely contemptible; yet these were the only people
from whom i could ever receive a reasonable answer.

i had obtained, by hard study, a good degree of knowledge in their
language: i was weary of being confined to an island where i received so
little countenance, and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity.

there was a great lord at court, nearly related to the king, and for that
reason alone used with respect.  he was universally reckoned the most
ignorant and stupid person among them.  he had performed many eminent
services for the crown, had great natural and acquired parts, adorned
with integrity and honour; but so ill an ear for music, that his
detractors reported, “he had been often known to beat time in the wrong
place;” neither could his tutors, without extreme difficulty, teach him
to demonstrate the most easy proposition in the mathematics.

hem, except at court and in visits of
ceremony, and would always command them to withdraw, when we were alone
together.

i entreated this illustrious person, to intercede in my behalf with his
majesty, for leave to depart; which he accordingly did, as he was pleased
to tell me, with regret: for indeed he had made me several offers very
advantageous, which, however, i refused, with expressions of the highest
acknowledgment.

on the 16th of february i took leave of his majesty and the court.  the
king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds english,
and my protector, his kinsman, as much more, together with a letter of
recommendation to a friend of his in lagado, the metropolis.  the island
being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it, i was let
down from the lowest gallery, in the same manner as i had been taken up.

the continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying
island, passes under the general name of _balnibarbi_; and the
metropolis,

continued during my stay, and was entertained in a most hospitable
manner.

the next morning after my arrival, he took me in his chariot to see the
town, which is about half the bigness of london; but the houses very
strangely built, and most of them out of repair.  the people in the
streets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were generally in
rags.  we passed through one of the town gates, and went about three
miles into the country, where i saw many labourers working with several
sorts of tools in the ground, but was not able to conjecture what they
were about: neither did observe any expectation either of corn or grass,
although the soil appeared to be excellent.  i could not forbear admiring
at these odd appearances, both in town and country; and i made bold to
desire my conductor, that he would be pleased to explain to me, what
could be meant by so many busy heads, hands, and faces, both in the
streets and the fields, because i did not discover any good 
 
 ___________________________
 
effects they
produced; but, on the contrary, i never knew a soil so unhappily
cultivated, houses so ill contrived and so ruinous, or a people whose
countenances and habit expressed so much misery and want.

this lord munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been some years
governor of lagado; but, by a cabal of ministers, was discharged for
insufficiency.  however, the king treated him with tenderness, as a
well-meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.

when i gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he made
no further answer than by telling me, “that i had not been long enough
among them to form a judgment; and that the different nations of the
world had different customs;” with other common topics to the same
purpose.  but, when we returned to his palace, he asked me “how i liked
the building, what absurdities i observed, and

tiful country; farmers’ houses, at small
distances, neatly built; the fields enclosed, containing vineyards,
corn-grounds, and meadows.  neither do i remember to have seen a more
delightful prospect.  his excellency observed my countenance to clear up;
he told me, with a sigh, “that there his estate began, and would continue
the same, till we should come to his house: that his countrymen ridiculed
and despised him, for managing his affairs no better, and for setting so
ill an example to the kingdom; which, however, was followed by very few,
such as were old, and wilful, and weak like himself.”

we came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble structure, built
according to the best rules of ancient architecture.  the fountains,
gardens, walks, avenues, and groves, were all disposed with exact
judgment and taste.  i gave due praises to every thing i saw, whereof his
excellency took not the least notice till after supper; when, there being
no third companion, he told me with a v

me back with a very little
smattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits acquired in that
airy region: that these persons, upon their return, began to dislike the
management of every thing below, and fell into schemes of putting all
arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics, upon a new foot.  to this end,
they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors in
lagado; and the humour prevailed so strongly among the people, that there
is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an academy.
in these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods of
agriculture and building, and new instruments, and tools for all trades
and manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one man shall do the work
of ten; a palace may be built in a week, of materials so durable as to
last for ever without repairing.  all the fruits of the earth shall come
to maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a
hundred fold more than they do at present; wit

projector of this cell was the most ancient student of the academy; his
face and beard were of a pale yellow; his hands and clothes daubed over
with filth.  when i was presented to him, he gave me a close embrace, a
compliment i could well have excused.  his employment, from his first
coming into the academy, was an operation to reduce human excrement to
its original food, by separating the several parts, removing the tincture
which it receives from the gall, making the odour exhale, and scumming
off the saliva.  he had a weekly allowance, from the society, of a vessel
filled with human ordure, about the bigness of a bristol barrel.

i saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder; who likewise showed
me a treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire, which
he intended to publish.

there was a most ingenious architect, who had contrived a new method for
building houses, by beginning at the roof, and working downward to the
foundation; wh

himself was at that time busy upon two great designs; the first, to sow
land with chaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be
contained, as he demonstrated by several experiments, which i was not
skilful enough to comprehend.  the other was, by a certain composition of
gums, minerals, and vegetables, outwardly applied, to prevent the growth
of wool upon two young lambs; and he hoped, in a reasonable time to
propagate the breed of naked sheep, all over the kingdom.

we crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as i have
already said, the projectors in speculative learning resided.

the first professor i saw, was in a very large room, with forty pupils
about him.  after salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a
frame, which took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of
the room, he said, “perhaps i might wonder to see him employed in a
project for improving speculative knowledge, by practical and mechanical

six hours a day the young students were employed in this labour; and the
professor showed me several volumes in large folio, already collected, of
broken sentences, which he intended to piece together, and out of those
rich materials, to give the world a complete body of all arts and
sciences; which, however, might be still improved, and much expedited, if
the public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such
frames in lagado, and oblige the managers to contribute in common their
several collections.

he assured me “that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his
youth; that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame, and made
the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in books
between the numbers of particles, nouns, and verbs, and other parts of
speech.”

i made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person, for his

forefathers; such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are
the common people.  however, many of the most learned and wise adhere to
the new scheme of expressing themselves by things; which has only this
inconvenience attending it, that if a man’s business be very great, and
of various kinds, he must be obliged, in proportion, to carry a greater
bundle of things upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong
servants to attend him.  i have often beheld two of those sages almost
sinking under the weight of their packs, like pedlars among us, who, when
they met in the street, would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and
hold conversation for an hour together; then put up their implements,
help each other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.

but for short conversations, a man may carry implements in his pockets,
and under his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house, he cannot be
at a loss.  therefore the room where company meet who practise this art,

let the occiputs, thus cut off, be interchanged, applying each to the
head of his opposite party-man.  it seems indeed to be a work that
requires some exactness, but the professor assured us, “that if it were
dexterously performed, the cure would be infallible.”  for he argued
thus: “that the two half brains being left to debate the matter between
themselves within the space of one skull, would soon come to a good
understanding, and produce that moderation, as well as regularity of
thinking, so much to be wished for in the heads of those, who imagine
they come into the world only to watch and govern its motion: and as to
the difference of brains, in quantity or quality, among those who are
directors in faction, the doctor assured us, from his own knowledge, that
“it was a perfect trifle.”

i heard a very warm debate between two professors, about the most
commodious and effectual ways and means of raising money, without
grieving the subject.  the first affirmed, “the justest

the women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill
in dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men, to be
determined by their own judgment.  but constancy, chastity, good sense,
and good nature, were not rated, because they would not bear the charge
of collecting.

to keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed that the
members should raffle for employment; every man first taking an oath, and
giving security, that he would vote for the court, whether he won or not;
after which, the losers had, in their turn, the liberty of raffling upon
the next vacancy.  thus, hope and expectation would be kept alive; none
would complain of broken promises, but impute their disappointments
wholly to fortune, whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of
a ministry.

another professor showed me a large paper of instructions for discovering
plots and conspiracies against the gov

pon which side they lay in bed; with which hand they wipe
their posteriors; take a strict view of their excrements, and, from the
colour, the odour, the taste, the consistence, the crudeness or maturity
of digestion, form a judgment of their thoughts and designs; because men
are never so serious, thoughtful, and intent, as when they are at stool,
which he found by frequent experiment; for, in such conjunctures, when he
used, merely as a trial, to consider which was the best way of murdering
the king, his ordure would have a tincture of green; but quite different,
when he thought only of raising an insurrection, or burning the
metropolis.

the whole discourse was written with great acuteness, containing many
observations, both curious and useful for politicians; but, as i
conceived, not altogether complete.  this i ventured to tell the author,
and offered, if he pleased, to supply him with some additions.  he
received my proposition with more compliance than is usual among writers,

ly those of the projecting species, professing “he would be glad
to receive further information.”

i told him, “that in the kingdom of tribnia, {454a} by the natives called
langdon, {454b} where i had sojourned some time in my travels, the bulk
of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers, witnesses,
informers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with
their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the
colours, the conduct, and the pay of ministers of state, and their
deputies.  the plots, in that kingdom, are usually the workmanship of
those persons who desire to raise their ow

the professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these
observations, and promised to make honourable mention of me in his
treatise.

i saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer
continuance, and began to think of returning home to england.

the continent, of which this kingdom is apart, extends itself, as i have
reason to believe, eastward, to that unknown tract of america westward of
california; and north, to the pacific ocean, which is not above a hundred
and fifty miles from lagado; where there is a good port, and much
commerce with the great island of luggnagg, situated to the north-west
about 29 degrees north latitude, and 140 longitude.  this island of
luggnagg stands south-eastward of japan, about a hundred leagues distant.

me the way, and carry my small baggage.  i took leave of my noble
protector, who had shown me so much favour, and made me a generous
present at my departure.

like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden.  i could not recover
myself in some time, till the governor assured me, “that i should receive
no hurt:” and observing my two companions to be under no concern, who had
been often entertained in the same manner, i began to take courage, and
related to his highness a short history of my several adventures; yet not
without some hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place
where i had seen those domestic spectres.  i had the honour to dine with
the governor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at
table.  i now observed myself to be less terrified than i had been in the
morning.  i stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to excuse
me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace.  my two
friends and i lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which is the
capital of this little island; and the

of the governor’s finger, immediately appeared in a large field, under
the window where we stood.  alexander was called up into the room: it was
with great difficulty that i understood his greek, and had but little of
my own.  he assured me upon his honour “that he was not poisoned, but
died of a bad fever by excessive drinking.”

next, i saw hannibal passing the alps, who told me “he had not a drop of
vinegar in his camp.”

i saw cæsar and pompey at the head of their troops, just ready to engage.
i saw the former, in his last great triumph.  i desired that the senate
of rome might appear before me, in one large chamber, and an assembly of

in good intelligence with each other; and cæsar freely confessed to me,
“that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal, by many
degrees, to the glory of taking it away.”  i had the honour to have much
conversation with brutus; and was told, “that his ancestor junius,
socrates, epaminondas, cato the younger, sir thomas more, and himself
were perpetually together:” a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of the
world cannot add a seventh.

the two gentlemen, who conducted me to the island, were pressed by their
private affairs to return in three days, which i employed in seeing some
of the modern dead, who had made the greatest figure, for two or three
hundred years past, in our own and other countries of europe; and having
been always a great admirer of old illustrious families, i desired the
governor would call up a dozen or two of kings, with their ancestors in
order for eight or nine generations.  but my disappointment was grievous
and unexpected.  for, instead of a long train with royal diadems, i saw
in one family two fiddlers, three spruce courtiers, and an italian
prelate.  in another, a barber, an abbot, and two cardinals.  i have too
great a veneration for crowned heads, to dwell any longer on so nice a
subject.  but as to counts, marquises, dukes, earls, and the like, i was
not so scrupulous.  and i confess, it was no

how great a share in the motions and events of courts, councils, and

was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and
revolutions in the world, and of the contemptible accidents to which they
owed their success.

here i discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write
anecdotes, or secret history; who send so many kings to their graves with
a cup of poison; will repeat the discourse between a prince and chief
minister, where no witness was by; unlock the thoughts and cabinets of
ambassadors and secretaries of state; and have the perpetual misfortune
to be mistaken.  here i discovered the true causes of many great events
that have surprised the world; how a whore can govern the back-stairs,
the back-stairs a council, and the council a senate.  a general
confessed, in my presence, “that he got a victory purel

intelligence, he beat the enemy, to whom he intended to betray the

never did once prefer any person of merit, unless by mistake, or
treachery of some minister in whom they confided; neither would they do
it if they were to live again:” and they showed, with great strength of
reason, “that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption,
because that positive, confident, restiff temper, which virtue infused
into a man, was a perpetual clog to public business.”

i had the curiosity to inquire

 justice in their dealings; for their true
spirit of liberty; for their valour, and love of their country.  neither
could i be wholly unmoved, after comparing the living with the dead, when
i considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a
piece of money by their grand-children; who, in selling their votes and
managing at elections, have acquired every vice and corruption that can
possibly be learned in a court.

balnibarbi, which, by the force of much commerce, is generally understood
in that town, especially by seamen and those employed in the customs.  i
gave him a short account of some particulars, and made my story as
plausible and consistent as i could; but i thought it necessary to
disguise my country, and call myself a hollander; because my intentions
were for japan, and i knew the dutch were the only europeans permitted to
enter into that kingdom.  i therefore told the officer, “that having been
shipwrecked on the coast of balnibarbi, and cast on a rock, i was
received up into laputa, or the flying island (of which he had often
heard), and was now endeavouring to get to japan, whence i might find a
convenience of returning to my own country.”  the officer said, “i must
be confined till he could receive orders from court, for which he would
write immediately, and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight.”  i was
carried to a

reported that i came from countries very remote, of which they had never
heard.

i hired a young man, who came in the same ship, to be an interpreter; he
was a native of luggnagg, but had lived some years at maldonada, and was
a perfect master of both languages.  by his assistance, i was able to
hold a conversation with those who came to visit me; but this consisted
only of their questions, and my answers.

the despatch came from court about the time we expected.  it contained a
warrant for conducting me and my retinue to _traldragdubh_, or
_trildrogdrib_ (for it is pronounced both ways as near as i can
remember), by a party of ten horse.  all my retinue was that poor lad for
an interpreter, whom i persuaded into my service, and, at my humble
request, we had each of us a mule to ride on.  a messenger was despatched
half a day’s journey before us, to give the king notice of my approach,
and to desire, “that his majesty would please to appoint a day and hour,
when it would by his gracious pleasure that i might have the honour to
lick the dust before his footstool.”  this is the court style, and i
found it to be more than matter of form: for, upon my admittance two days
after my arrival, i was commanded to crawl upon my belly, and lick the
floor as i advanced; but, on account of my being a stranger, care was
taken to have it made so clean, that the dus

is strewed with dust on purpose, when the person to be admitted happens
to have powerful enemies at court; and i have seen a great lord with his
mouth so crammed, that when he had crept to the proper distance from the
throne; he was not able to speak a word.  neither is there any remedy;
because it is capital for those, who receive an audience to spit or wipe
their mouths in his majesty’s presence.  there is indeed another custom,
which i cannot altogether approve of: when the king has a mind to put any
of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the
floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition,
which being licked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours.  but in
justice to this prince’s great clemency, and the care he has of his
subjects’ lives (wherein it were much to be wished that the monarchs of
europe would imitate him), it must be mentioned for his honour, that
strict orders are given to have the infected par

washed after every such execution, which, if his domestics neglect, they
are in danger of incurring his royal displeasure.  i myself heard him
give directions, that one of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it
was to give notice about washing the floor after an execution, but
maliciously had omitted it; by which neglect a young lord of great hopes,
coming to an audience, was unfortunately poisoned, although the king at
that time had no design against his life.  but this good prince was so
gracious as to forgive the poor page his whipping, upon promise that he
would do so no more, without special orders.

to return from this digression.  when i had crept within four yards of
the throne, i raised myself gently upon my knees, and then striking my
forehead seven times against the ground, i pronounced the following
words, as they had been taught me the night before, _inckpling

land, for all persons admitted to the king’s presence.  it may be
rendered into english thus: “may your celestial majesty outlive the sun,
eleven moons and a half!”  to this the king returned some answer, which,
although i could not understand, yet i replied as i had been directed:
_fluft drin yalerick dwuldom prastrad mirpush_, which properly signifies,
“my tongue is in the mouth of my friend;” and by this expression was
meant, that i desired leave to bring my interpreter; whereupon the young
man already mentioned was accordingly introduced, by whose intervention i
answered as many questions as his majesty could put in above an hour.  i

in that of luggnagg.

the king was much delighted with my company, and ordered his
_bliffmarklub_, or high-chamberlain, to appoint a lodging in the court
for me and my interpreter; with a daily allowance for my table, and a
large purse of gold for my common expenses.

i staid three months in this country, out of perfect obedience to his
majesty; who was pleased highly to favour me, and made me very honourable
offers.  but i thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to
pass the remainder of my days with my wife and

time grew larger, and changed its colour; for at twelve years old it
became green, so continued till five and twenty, then turned to a deep
blue: at five and forty it grew coal black, and as large as an english
shilling; but never admitted any further alteration.”  he said, “these
births were so rare, that he did not believe there could be above eleven
hundred struldbrugs, of both sexes, in the whole kingdom; of which he
computed about fifty in the metropolis, and, among the rest, a young girl
born; about three years ago: that these productions were not peculiar to
any family, but a mere effect of chance; and the children of the
_struldbrugs_ themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the
people.”

i freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight, upon
hearing this account: and the person who gave it me happening to
understand the balnibarbian language, which i spoke ver

not forbear breaking out into expressions, perhaps a little too
extravagant.  i cried out, as in a rapture, “happy nation, where every
child hath at least a chance for being immortal!  happy people, who enjoy
so many living examples of ancient virtue, and have masters ready to
instruct them in the wisdom of all former ages! but happiest, beyond all
comparison, are those excellent _struldbrugs_, who, being born exempt
from that universal calamity of human nature, have their minds free and

orehead being so remarkable a distinction, that i could not have
easily overlooked it: and it was impossible that his majesty, a most
judicious prince, should not provide himself with a good number of such
wise and able counsellors.  yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend
sages was too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court:
and we often find by experience, that young men are too opinionated and
volatile to be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors.  however,
since the king was pleased to allow me access to his royal person, i was
resolved, upon the very first occasion, to deliver my opinion to him on
this matter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and
whether he would please to take my advice or not, yet in one thing i was
determined, that his majesty having frequently offered me an
establishment in this country, i would, with great thankfulness, accept
the favour, and pass my life here in the conversation of those superior

the great happiness and advantages of immortal life, and they were
desirous to know, in a particular manner, what scheme of living i should
have formed to myself, if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a
_struldbrug_.”

i answered, “it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a
subject, especially to me, who had been often apt to amuse myself with
visions of what i should do, if i were a king, a general, or a great
lord: and upon this very case, i had frequently run over the whole system
how i should employ myself, and pass the time, if i were sure to live for
ever.

“that, if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a
_struldbrug_, as soon as i could discover my own happiness, by
understanding the difference between life and death, i would first
resolve, by all arts and methods, whatsoever, to procure myself riches.

myself to the study of arts and sciences, by which i should arrive in

every action and event of consequence, that happened in the public,

the strong influence of our own example, would probably prevent that
continual degeneracy of human nature so justly complained of in all ages.

“add to this, the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of states
and empires; the changes in the lower and upper world; ancient cities in
ruins, and obscure villages become the seats of kings; famous rivers
lessening into shallow brooks; the ocean leaving one coast dry, and
overwhelming another; the discovery of many countries yet unknown;
barbarity overrunning the politest nations, and the most barbarous become
civilized.  i should then see the discovery of the longitude, the
perpetual motion, the universal medicine, and many other great
inventions, brought to the utmost perfection.

last, the same gentleman who had been my interpreter, said, “he was
desired by the rest to set me right in a few mistakes, which i had fallen
into through the common imbecility of human nature, and upon that
allowance was less answerable for them.  that this breed of _struldbrugs_
was peculiar to their country, for there were no such people either in
balnibarbi or japan, where he had the honour to be ambassador from his
majesty, and found the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to
believe that the fact was possible: and it appeared from my astonishment
when he first mentioned the matter to me, that i received it as a thing
wholly new, and scarcely to be credited.  that in the two kingdoms above
mentioned, where, during his residence, he had conversed very much, he
observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind.  that
whoever had one foot in the grave was sure to hold back the other as
strongly as he could.  that the oldest had still ho

use it supposed a perpetuity of youth, health, and vigour, which no
man could be so foolish to hope, however extravagant he may be in his
wishes.  that the question therefore was not, whether a man would choose
to be always in the prime of youth, attended with prosperity and health;
but how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages
which old age brings along with it.  for although few men will avow their
desires of being immortal, upon such hard conditions, yet in the two
kingdoms before mentioned, of balnibarbi and japan, he observed that
every man desired to put off death some time longer, let it approach ever
so late: and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly, except he
were incited by the extremity of grief or torture.  and he appealed to
me, whether in those countries i had travelled, as well as my own, i had
not observed the same general disposition.”

after this preface, he gave me a particular account of the _struldbrugs_
among them.  he said, “th

particulars of any fact, it is safer to depend on common tradition, than
upon their best recollections.  the least miserable among them appear to
be those who turn to dotage, and entirely lose their memories; these meet
with more pity and assistance, because they want many bad qualities which
abound in others.

“if a _struldbrug_ happen to marry one of his own kind, the marriage is
dissolved of course, by the courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as the
younger of the two comes to be fourscore; for the law thinks it a
reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned, without any fault of
their own, to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have their
misery doubled by the load of a wife.

distinction of taste, but eat and drink whatever they can get, without
relish or appetite.  the diseases they were subject to still continue,
without increasing or diminishing.  in talking, they forget the common
appellation of things, and the names of persons, even of those who are
their nearest friends and relations.  for the same reason, they never can
amuse themselves with reading, because their memory will not serve to
carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end; and by this
defect, they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might
otherwise be capable.

they are despised and hated by all sorts of people.  when one of them is
born, it is reckoned ominous, and their birth is recorded very
particularly so that you may know their age by consulting the register,
which, however, has not been kept above a thousand years past, or at
least has been destroyed by time or public disturbances.  but the usual
way of computing how old they are, is by asking them what kings or great
persons they can remember, and then consulting history; for infallibly
the last prince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were
fourscore years old.

the reader will easily believe, that from what i had hear and seen, my
keen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated.  i grew heartily
ashamed of the pleasing visions i had formed; and thought no tyrant could
invent a death into which i would not run with pleasure, from such a
life.  the king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends
upon this occasion, and rallied me very pleasantly; wishing i could send
a couple of _struldbrugs_ to my own country, to arm our people against
the fear of death; but this, it seems, is forbidden by the fundamental
laws of the kingdom, or else i should have been well content with the
trouble and expense of transporting them.

to the reader, because it seems to be a little out of the common way; at
least i do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that
has come to my hands: and if i am deceived, my excuse must be, that it is
necessary for travellers who describe the same country, very often to
agree in dwelling on the same particulars, without deserving the censure
of having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them.

there is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great
empire of japan; and it is very probable, that the japanese authors may
have given some account of the _struldbrugs_; but my stay in japan was so
short, and i was so entirely a stranger to the language, that i was not
qualified to make any inquiries.  but i hope the dutch, upon this notice,
will be curious and able enough to supply my defects.

island.  in six days i found a vessel ready to carry me to japan, and
spent fifteen days in the voyage.  we landed at a small port-town called
xamoschi, situated on the south-east part of japan; the town lies on the
western point, where there is a narrow strait leading northward into
along arm of the sea, upon the north-west part of which, yedo, the
metropolis, stands.  at landing, i showed the custom-house officers my
letter from the king of luggnagg to his imperial majesty.  they knew the
seal perfectly well; it was as broad as the palm of my hand.  the
impression was, _a king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth_.  the
magistrates of the town, hearing of my letter, received me as a public
minister.  they provided me with carriages and servants, and bore my
charges to yedo; where i was admitted to an audience, and delivered my
letter, which was opened with great ceremony, and explained to the
emperor by an interpreter, who t

ed, as i had before determined,
“that i was a dutch merchant, shipwrecked in a very remote country,
whence i had travelled by sea and land to luggnagg, and then took
shipping for japan; where i knew my countrymen often traded, and with
some of these i hoped to get an opportunity of returning into europe: i
therefore most humbly entreated his royal favour, to give order that i
should be conducted in safety to nangasac.”  to this i added another
petition, “that for the sake of my patron the king of luggnagg, his
majesty would condescend to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed on
my countrymen, of trampling upon the crucifix: because i had been thrown
into his kingdom by my misfortunes, without any intention of trading.”
when this latter petition was interpreted to the emperor, he seemed a
little surprised; and said, “he believed i was the first of my countrymen
who ever made any scruple in this point; and that he began to doubt,
whether i was a real hollander, or not; but rath

gratify the king of luggnagg by an uncommon mark of his favour, he would
comply with the singularity of my humour; but the affair must be managed
with dexterity, and his officers should be commanded to let me pass, as
it were by forgetfulness.  for he assured me, that if the secret should
be discovered by my countrymen the dutch, they would cut my throat in the
voyage.”  i returned my thanks, by the interpreter, for so unusual a
favour; and some troops being at that time on their march to nangasac,

either side.  i fell into a beaten road, where i saw many tracts of human
feet, and some of cows, but most of horses.  at last i beheld several
animals in a field, and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees.
their shape was very singular and deformed, which a little discomposed
me, so that i lay down behind a thicket to observe them better.  some of
them coming forward near the place where i lay, gave me an opportunity of
distinctly marking their form.  their heads and breasts were covered with
a thick hair, some frizzled, and others lank; they had beards like goats,
and a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the fore parts of their
legs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that i might see
their skins, which were of a brown buff colour.  they had no tails, nor
any hair at all on their buttocks, except about the anus, which, i
presume, nature had placed there to defend them as they sat on the
ground, for this po

hey had long lank hair on their heads, but none on their
faces, nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their
bodies, except about the anus and pudenda.  the dugs hung between their
fore feet, and often reached almost to the ground as they walked.  the
hair of both sexes was of several colours, brown, red, black, and yellow.
upon the whole, i never beheld, in all my travels, so disagreeable an
animal, or one against which i naturally conceived so strong an
antipathy.  so that, thinking i had seen enough, full of contempt and
aversion, i got up, and pursued the beaten road, hoping it might direct
me to the cabin of some indian.  i had not got far, when i met one of
these creatures full in my way, and coming up directly to me.  the ugly
monster, when he saw me, distorted several ways, every feature of his
visage, and stared, as at an object he had never seen before; then
approaching nearer, lifted up his fore-paw, whether out of curiosity or
mischief i could not tell; but i dre

w my hanger, and gave him a good blow
with the flat side of it, for i durst not strike with the edge, fearing
the inhabitants might be provoked against me, if they should come to know
that i had killed or maimed any of their cattle.  when the beast felt the
smart, he drew back, and roared so loud, that a herd of at least forty
came flocking about me from the next field, howling and making odious
faces; but i ran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back against it,
kept them off by waving my hanger.  several of this cursed brood, getting
hold of the branches behind, leaped up into the tree, whence they began
to discharge their excrements on my head; however, i escaped pretty well
by sticking close to the stem of the tree, but was almost stifled with
the filth, which fell about me on every side.

in the midst of this distress, i observed them all to run away on a
sudden as fast 
 
 ___________________________
 
as they could; at which i ventured to leave the tree and
pursue the road, wondering what it was that could put them into this
fright.  but looking on my left hand, i saw a horse walking softly in the
field; which my persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause of
their flight.  the horse started a little, when he came near me, but soon
recovering himself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of
wonder; he viewed my hands and feet, walking round me several times.  i
would have pursued my journey, but he placed himself directly in the way,
yet looking with a very mild aspect, never offering the least violence.
we stood gazing at each other for some time; at last i took the boldness
to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it, using the
common style and whistle of jockeys, when they are going to handle a
strange horse.  but this animal seemed to receive my civilities with
disdain, shook his head, and bent his brows

, softly raising up his right
fore-foot to remove my hand.  then he neighed three or four times, but in
so different a cadence, that i almost began to think he was speaking to
himself, in some language of his own.

while he and i were thus employed, another horse came up; who applying
himself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently struck each
other’s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying
the sound, which seemed to be almost articulate.  they went some paces
off, as if it were to confer together, walking side by side, backward and
forward, like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight, but often
turning their eyes towar

discourse
together as they pleased.  but the first, who was a dapple gray,
observing me to steal off, neighed after me in so expressive a tone, that
i fancied myself to understand what he meant; whereupon i turned back,
and came near to him to expect his farther commands: but concealing my
fear as much as i could, for i began to be in some pain how this
adventure might terminate; and the reader will easily believe i did not
much like my present situation.

the two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness upon
my face and hands.  the gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right
fore-hoof, and discomposed it so much that i was forced to adjust it
better by taking it off and settling it again; whereat, both he and his
companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised: the latter
felt the lappet of my coat, and finding it to hang loose about me, they
both looked with new signs of wonder.  he stroked my right hand, seeming
to admire the softness and colour; bu

t he squeezed it so hard between his
hoof and his pastern, that i was forced to roar; after which they both
touched me with all possible tenderness.  they were under great
perplexity about my shoes and stockings, which they felt very often,
neighing to each other, and using various gestures, not unlike those of a
philosopher, when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult
phenomenon.

upon the whole, the behaviour of these animals was so orderly and
rational, so acute and judicious, that i at last concluded they must
needs be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some
design, and seeing a stranger in the way, resolved to divert themselves
with him; or, perhaps, were really amaze

ventured to address them in the following manner:
“gentlemen, if you be conjurers, as i have good cause to believe, you can
understand my language; therefore i make bold to let your worships know
that i am a poor distressed englishman, driven by his misfortunes upon
your coast; and i entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if
he were a real horse, to some house or village where i can be relieved.
in return of which favour, i will make you a present of this knife and
bracelet,” taking them out of my pocket.  the two creatures stood silent
while i spoke, seeming to listen with great attention, and when i had
ended, they neighed frequently towards each other, as if they were
engaged in serious conversation.  i plainly observed that their language
expressed the passions very well, and the words might, with little pains,
be resolved into an alphabet more easily than the chinese.

i could frequently distinguish the word _yahoo_, which was repeated by
each of them several times: a

 though very far from any degree of perfection.  then the bay
tried me with a second word, much harder to be pronounced; but reducing
it to the english orthography, may be spelt thus, _houyhnhnm_.  i did not
succeed in this so well as in the former; but after two or three farther
trials, i had better fortune; and they both appeared amazed at my
capacity.

after some further discourse, which i then conjectured might relate to
me, the two friends took their leaves, with the same compliment of
striking each other’s hoof; and the gray made me signs that i should walk
before him; wherein i thought it prudent to comply, till i could find a
better director.  when i offered to slacken my pace, he would cry _hhuun
hhuun_: i guessed his meaning, and gave him to understand, as well as i
could, “that i was weary, and not able to walk faster;” upon which he
would stand awhile to let me rest.

beyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the
house, to which you passed through three doors, opposite to each other,
in the manner of a vista.  we went through the second room towards the
third.  here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to attend: i waited
in the second room, and got ready my presents for the master and mistress
of the house; they were two knives, three bracelets of false pearls, a
small looking-glass, and a bead necklace.  the horse neighed three or
four times, and i waited to hear some answers in a human voice, but i
heard no other returns than in the same dialect, only one or two a little
shriller than his.  i began to think that this house must belong to some
person of great note among them, because there appeared so much ceremony
before i could gain admittance.  but, that a man of quality should be
served all by horses, was beyond my comprehension.  i feared my brain was

their backs, nuzzling with their face against the mothers’ shoulders.
the fore-feet of the _yahoo_ differed from my hands in nothing else but
the length of the nails, the coarseness and brownness of the palms, and
the hairiness on the backs.  there was the same resemblance between our
feet, with the same differences; which i knew very well, though the
horses did not, because of my shoes and stockings; the same in every part
of our bodies except as to hairiness and colour, which i have already
described.

the great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to see
the rest of my body so very different from that of a _yahoo_, for which i
was obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception.  the sorrel
nag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, as we shall
describe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; i took it in
my hand, and, having smelt it,

horse and mare ate their own hay, and their own mash of oats and milk,
with much decency and regularity.  the behaviour of the young colt and
foal appeared very modest, and that of the master and mistress extremely
cheerful and complaisant to their guest.  the gray ordered me to stand by
him; and much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me,
as i found by the stranger’s often looking on me, and the frequent
repetition of the word _yahoo_.

he put his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify, that
i should reduce them to their former shape, which i presently did,

house, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a prodigy,
that a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature.  i
pointed to every thing, and inquired the name of it, which i wrote down
in my journal-book when i was alone, and corrected my bad accent by
desiring those of the family to pronounce it often.  in this employment,
a sorrel nag, one of the under-servants, was very ready to assist me.

in speaking, they pronounced through the nose and throat, and their
language approaches nearest to the high-dutch, or german, of any i know
in europe; but is much more graceful and significant.  the emperor
charles v. made almost the same observation, when he said “that if he
were to speak to his horse, it should be in high-dutch.”

many hours of his leisure to instruct me.  he was convinced (as he

_houyhnhnm_, and seemed, in his words and actions, to discover some

many questions, and received such answers as i was able to return.  by
all these advantages i made so great a progress, that, in five months
from my arrival i understood whatever was spoken, and could express
myself tolerably well.

the _houyhnhnms_, who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing
and talking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right _yahoo_,
because my body had a different covering from others of my kind.  they
were astonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on
my head, face, and hands; but i discovered that secret to my master upon
an accident which happened about a fortnight before.

gone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my clothes.

excuse, if i did not expose those parts that nature taught us to
conceal.”  he said, “my discourse was all very strange, but especially
the last part; for he could not understand, why nature should teach us to
conceal what nature had given; that neither himself nor family were
ashamed of any parts of their bodies; but, however, i might do as i
pleased.”  whereupon i first unbuttoned my coat, and pulled it off.  i
did the same with my waistcoat.  i drew off my shoes, stockings, and
breeches.  i let my shirt down to my waist, and drew up the bottom;
fastening it like a girdle about my middle, to hide my nakedness.

my master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity
and admiration.  he took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece
after another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body very
gently, and looked round me several times; after which, he said, it was
plain i must be a perfect _yahoo_; but that i differed very much from th

my want of hair in several parts of my body; the shape and shortness of
my claws behind and before; and my affectation of walking continually on
my two hinder feet.  he desired to see no more; and gave me leave to put
on my clothes again, for i was shuddering with cold.

i expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation of
_yahoo_, an odious animal, for which i had so utter a hatred and
contempt: i begged he would forbear applying that word to me, and make
the same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered to
see me.  i requested likewise, “that the secret of my having a false

a female man, whom we called queen; that i left it to get riches, whereby
i might maintain myself and family, when i should return; that, in my
last voyage, i was commander of the ship, and had about fifty _yahoos_
under me, many of which died at sea, and i was forced to supply them by
others picked out from several nations; that our ship was twice in danger
of being sunk, the first time by a great storm, and the second by
striking against a rock.”  here my master interposed, by asking me, “how
i could persuade strangers, out of different countries, to venture with
me, after the losses i had sustained, and the hazards i had run?”  i
said, “they were fellows of desperate fortunes, forced to fly from the
places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes.  some
were undone by lawsuits; others spent all they had in drinking, whoring,
and gaming; others fled for treason; many for murder, theft, poisonin

sodomy; for flying from their colours, or deserting to the enemy; and
most of them had broken prison; none of these durst return to their
native countries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a jail; and
therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other
places.”

during this discourse, my master was pleased to interrupt me several
times.  i had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the
nature of the several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced
to fly their country.  this labour took up several days’ conversation,
before he was able to comprehend me.  he was wholly at a loss to know
what could be the use or necessity of practising those vices.  to clear
up which, i endeavoured to give some

all this i was forced to define and describe by putting cases and making
suppositions.  after which, like one whose imagination was struck with
something never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes with
amazement and indignation.  power, government, war, law, punishment, and
a thousand other things, had no terms wherein that language could express
them, which made the difficulty almost insuperable, to give my master any
conception of what i meant.  but being of an excellent understanding,
much improved by contemplation and converse, he at last arrived a

slaves of the rest, in order to civilize and reduce them from their
barbarous way of living.  it is a very kingly, honourable, and frequent
practice, when one prince desires the assistance of another, to secure
him against an invasion, that the assistant, when he has driven out the
invader, should seize on the dominions himself, and kill, imprison, or
banish, the prince he came to relieve.  alliance by blood, or marriage,

i could not forbear shaking my head, and smiling a little at his
ignorance.  and being no stranger to the art of war, i gave him a

whence, in return, we brought the materials of diseases, folly, and vice,

robbing, stealing, cheating, pimping, flattering, suborning, forswearing,

i told him “we fed on a thousand things which operated contrary to each

without eating a bit, which disposed us to sloth, inflamed our bodies,
and precipitated or prevented digestion; that prostitute female _yahoos_

superior anterior orifice only for the intromission of solids and

manner directly contrary, by interchanging the use of each orifice;
forcing solids and liquids in at the anus, and making evacuations at the
mouth.

“but, besides real diseases, we are subject to many that are only
imaginary, for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures; these
have their several names, and so have the drugs that are proper for them;
and with these our female _yahoos_ are always infested.

wherein they seldom fail; their predictions in real diseases, when they

through several gradations, to be successors to their lord.

“he is usually governed by a decayed wench, or favourite footman, who are
the tunnels through which all graces are conveyed, and may properly be
called, in the last resort, the governors of the kingdom.”

one day, in discourse, my master, having heard me mention the nobility of
my country, was pleased to make me a compliment which i could not pretend
to deserve: “that he was sure i must have been born of some noble family,
because i far exceeded in shape, colour, and cleanliness, all the
_yahoos_ of his nation, although i seemed to fail in strength and
agility, which must be imputed to my different way of living from those
other brutes; and besides i was not only endowed with the facul

home, and, for want of enemies, engage in what i call a civil war among
themselves.

“that in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of
several colours, whereof the _yahoos_ are violently fond: and when part
of these stones is fixed in the earth, as it sometimes happens, they will
dig with their claws for whole days to get them out; then carry them
away, and hide them by heaps in their kennels; but still looking round
with great caution, for fear their comrades should find out their
treasure.”  my master said, “he could never discover the reason of this
unnatural appetite, or how these stones could be of any use to a _yahoo_;
but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice
which i had ascribed to mankind.  that he had once, by way of experiment,
privately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of his
_yahoos_ had buried it; whereupon the sordid animal, missi

his honour had further observed, “that a female _yahoo_ would often stand
behind a bank or a bush, to gaze on the young males passing by, and then
appear, and hide, using many antic gestures and grimaces, at which time
it was observed that she had a most offensive smell; and when any of the
males advanced, would slowly retire, looking often back, and with a
counterfeit show of fear, run off into some convenient place, where she
knew the male would follow her.

“at other times, if a female stranger came among them, three or four of
her own sex would get about her, and stare, and chatter, and grin, and
smell her all over; and then turn off with gestures, that seemed to
express contempt and disdain.”

perhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations, which he
had drawn from what he observed himself, or had been

ing into their clutches, when i
happened to stray at any distance without my hanger.  and i have reason
to believe they had some imagination that i was of their own species,
which i often assisted myself by stripping up my sleeves, and showing my
naked arms and breasts in their sight, when my protector was with me.  at
which times they would approach as near as they durst, and imitate my
actions after the manner of monkeys, but ever with great signs of hatred;
as a tame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wild
ones, when he happens to be got among them.

a young male of three years old, and endeavoured, by all marks of
tenderness, to make it quiet; but the little imp fell a squalling, and
scratching, and biting with such violence, that i was forced to let it

those creatures could not be _yinhniamshy_ (or _aborigines_ of the land),
because of the violent hatred the _houyhnhnms_, as well as all other
animals, bore them, which, although their evil disposition sufficiently
deserved, could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had been
_aborigines_, or else they would have long since been rooted out; that
the inhabitants, taking a fancy to use the service of the _yahoos_, had,
very imprudently, neglected to cultivate the breed of asses, which are a
comely animal, easily kept, more tame and orderly, without any offensive
smell, strong enough for labour, although they yield to the other in
agility of body, and if their braying be no agreeable sound, it is far
preferable to the horrible howlings of the _yahoos_.”

several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose, when my
master proposed an expedient to the a

finishes a canoe by the help of a fellow-servant, and puts to sea at a
venture.

i had settled my little economy to my own heart’s content.  my master had
ordered a room to be made for me, after their manner, about six yards
from the house: the sides and floors of which i plastered with clay, and
covered with rush-mats of my own contriving.  i had beaten hemp, which
there grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this i filled with
the feathers of several birds i had taken with springes made of _yahoos’_
hairs, and were excellent food.  i had worked two chairs with my knife,
the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part.  when
my clothes were worn to rags, i made myself others with the skins of
rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called
_nnuhnoh_, the skin of which is covered with a fine down.  of these i
also made very tolerable stockings.  i soled my

atural awe,
which the _yahoos_ and all other animals bear toward them; but it grew
upon me by decrees, much sooner than i imagined, and was mingled with a
respectful love and gratitude, that they would condescend to distinguish
me from the rest of my species.

when i thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human race
in general, i considered them, as they really were, _yahoos_ in shape and
disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified with the gift
of speech; but making no other use of reason, than to improve and
multiply those vices whereof their brethren in this country had only the
share that nature allotted them.  when i happened to behold the
reflection of my own form in a lake or fountain, i turned away my face in
horror and detestation of myself, and could better endure the sight of a
common _yahoo_ than of my own person.  by conversing with the
_houyhnhnms_, and looking upon them with delight, i fell to imitate their
gait and gesture, which is now grow

tell me, in a blunt way, “that i trot like a horse;” which, however, i
take for a great compliment.  neither shall i disown, that in speaking i
am apt to fall into the voice and manner of the _houyhnhnms_, and hear
myself ridiculed on that account, without the least mortification.

in the midst of all this happiness, and when i looked upon myself to be
fully settled for life, my master sent for me one morning a little
earlier than his usual hour.  i observed by his countenance that he was
in some perplexity, and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak.
after a short silence, he told me, “he did not know how i would take what

nature.  i answered in a faint voice, “that death would have been too
great a happiness; that although i could not blame the assembly’s
exhortation, or the urgency of his friends; yet, in my weak and corrupt
judgment, i thought it might consist with reason to have been less
rigorous; that i could not swim a league, and probably the nearest land
to theirs might be distant above a hundred: that many materials,
necessary for making a small vessel to carry me off, were wholly wanting
in this country; which, however, i would attempt, in obedience and
gratitude to his honour, although i concluded the thing to be impossible,
and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction; that
the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils;
for, supposing i should escape with life by some strange adventure, how
could i think with temper of passing my days among _yahoos_, and
relapsing into my old corrup

tions, for want of examples to lead and keep
me within the paths of virtue? that i knew too well upon what solid
reasons all the determinations of the wise _houyhnhnms_ were founded, not
to be shaken by arguments of mine, a miserable _yahoo_; and therefore,
after presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants’
assistance in making a vessel, and desiring a reasonable time for so
difficult a work, i told him i would endeavour to preserve a wretched
being; and if ever i returned to england, was not without hopes of being
useful to my own species, by celebrating the praises of the renowned
_houyhnhnms_, and proposing their virtues to the imitation of mankind.”

my master, in a few words, made me a very gracious reply; allowed me the
space of two months to finish my boat; and ordered the sorrel nag, my
fellow-servant (for s

o, at this distance, i may presume to call him), to
follow my instruction; because i told my master, “that his help would be
sufficient, and i knew he had a tenderness for me.”

in his company, my first business was to go to that part of the coast
where my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore.  i got upon a
height, and looking on every side into the sea; fancied i saw a small
island toward the north-east.  i took out my pocket glass, and could then
clearly distinguish it above five leagues off, as i computed; but it
appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud: for as he had no
conception of any country beside his own, so he could not be as expert in
distinguishing remote objects at sea, as we who so much converse in that
element.

after i had discovered this island, i considered no further; but resolved

consequence to fortune.

i returned home, and consulting with the sorrel nag, we went into a copse
at some distance, where i with my knife, and he with a sharp flint,
fastened very artificially after their manner, to a wooden handle, cut
down several oak wattles, about the thickness of a walking-staff, and
some larger pieces.  but i shall not trouble the reader with a particular
description of my own mechanics; let it suffice to say, that in six weeks
time with the help of the sorrel nag, who performed the parts that
required most labour, i finished a sort of indian canoe, but much larger,
covering it with the skins of _yahoos_, well stitched together with
hempen threads of my own making.  my sail was likewise composed of the
skins of the same animal; but i made use of the youngest i c

to my grave.  i apprehended the arrow might be poisoned, and paddling out
of the reach of their darts (being a calm day), i made a shift to suck
the wound, and dress it as well as i could.

i was at a loss what to do, for i durst not return to the same
landing-place, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle, for the
wind, though very gentle, was against me, blowing north-west.  as i was
looking about for a secure landing-place, i saw a sail to the
north-north-east, which appearing every minute more visible, i was in
some doubt whether i should wait for them or not; but at last my
detestation of the _yahoo_ race prevailed: and turning my canoe, i sailed
and paddled together to the south, and got into the same creek whence i
set out in the morning, choosing rather to trust myself among these
barbarians, than live with european _yahoos_.  i drew up my canoe as
close as i could to the sho

the ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her long boat
with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems, was very
well known); but i did not observe it, till the boat was almost on shore;
and it was too late to seek another hiding-place.  the seamen at their
landing observed my canoe, and rummaging it all over, easily conjectured
that the owner could not be far off.  four of them, well armed, searched
every cranny and lurking-hole, till at last they found me flat on my face
behind the stone.  they gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth
dress; my coat made of skins, my wooden-soled shoes, and my furred
stockings; whence, however, they concluded, i was not a native of the
place, who all go naked.  one of the seamen, in portuguese, bid me rise,
and asked who i was.  i understood that language very well, and getting
upon my feet, said, “i was a poor _yahoo_ banished from the _houyhnhnms_,
and desired they wo

uld please to let me depart.”  they admired to hear me
answer them in their own tongue, and saw by my complexion i must be a
european; but were at a loss to know what i meant by _yahoos_ and
_houyhnhnms_; and at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in
speaking, which resembled the neighing of a horse.  i trembled all the
while betwixt fear and hatred.  i again desired leave to depart, and was
gently moving to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know,
“what country i was of? whence i came?” with many other questions.  i
told them “i was born in england, whence i came about five years ago, and
then their country and ours were at peace.  i therefore hoped they would
not treat me as an enemy, since i meant them no harm, but was a poor

unfortunate life.”

when they began to talk, i thought i never heard or saw any thing more
unnatural; for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should
speak in england, or a _yahoo_ in _houyhnhnmland_.  the honest portuguese
were equally amazed at my strange dress, and the odd manner of delivering
my words, which, however, they understood very well.  they spoke to me
with great humanity, and said, “they were sure the capta

highly probable, that such travellers, who shall hereafter visit the
countries described in this work of mine, may, by detecting my errors (if
there be any), and adding many new discoveries of their own, justle me
out of vogue, and stand in my place, making the world forget that ever i

wrote for fame: but as my sole intention was the public good, i cannot be
altogether disappointed.  for who can read of the virtues i have
mentioned in the glorious _houyhnhnms_, without being ashamed of his own
vices, when he considers himself as the reasoning, governing animal of
his country?  i shall say nothing of those remote nations where _yahoos_

their heads.  the _houyhnhnms_ indeed appear not to be so well prepared
for war, a science to which they are perfect strangers, and especially
against missive weapons.  however, supposing myself to be a minister of
state, i could never give my advice for invading them.  their prudence,
unanimity, unacquaintedness with fear, and their love of their country,
would amply supply all defects in the military art.  imagine twenty
thousand of them breaking into the midst of an european army, confounding
the ranks, overturning the carriages, battering the warriors’ faces into
mummy by terrible yerks from their hinder hoofs; for they would well
deserve the character given to augustus, _recalcitrat undique tutus_.

majesty’s dominions by my discoveries.  to say the truth, i had conceived
a few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon
those occasions.  for instance, a crew of pirates are driven by a storm
they know not whither; at length a boy discovers land from the topmast;
they go on shore to rob and plunder, they see a harmless people, are
entertained with kindness; they give the country a new name; they take
formal possession of it for their king; they set up a rotten plank, or a
stone, for a memorial; they murder two or three dozen of the natives,
bring away a couple more, by force, for a sample; return home, and get
their pardon.  here commences a new dominion acquired with a title by
divine right.  ships are sent with the first opportunity; the natives
driven out or destroyed; their princes tortured to discover their gold; a
free license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust, the earth reeking
with the blood of its inhabitants: an

valour, or our interest.  however, if those whom it more concerns think
fit to be of another opinion, i am ready to depose, when i shall be
lawfully called, that no european did ever visit those countries before
me.  i mean, if the inhabitants ought to be believed, unless a dispute
may arise concerning the two _yahoos_, said to have been seen many years
ago upon a mountain in _houyhnhnmland_.

but, as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereign’s name, it
never came once into my thoughts; and if it had, yet, as my affairs then
stood, i should perhaps, in point of prudence and self-preservation, have
put it off to a better opportunity.
