Friar Bernardine - 
      Jacomo's friend and a friar, though of a different order from Jacomo. Bernardine fights with Jacomo as both men want Barabas's money to go to their own monasteries. Bernardine is strangled with his own belt by Ithamore after Barabas pretends that he is converting to Christianity. Like Jacomo, Marlowe uses Bernardine to lampoon the corruption of the Catholic clergy.
