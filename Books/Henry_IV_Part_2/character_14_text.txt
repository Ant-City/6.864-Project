with child by the stern tyrant war,
    and no such matter? rumour is a pipe
    blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,
    and of so easy and so plain a stop
    that the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
    the still-discordant wav'ring multitude,
    can play upon it. but what need i thus
    my well-known body to anatomize
    among my household? why is rumour here?
    i run before king harry's victory,
    who, in a bloody field by shrewsbury,
    hath beaten down young hotspur and his troops,
    quenching the flame of bold rebellion
    even with the rebels' blood. but what mean i
    to speak so true at first? my office is
    to noise abroad that harry monmouth fell
    under the wrath of noble hotspur's sword,
    and that the king before the douglas' rage
    stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
    this have i rumour'd through the peasant towns
    between that royal field of shrewsbury
    and this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,

 of him
    i did demand what news from shrewsbury.
    he told me that rebellion had bad luck,
    and that young harry percy's spur was cold.
    with that he gave his able horse the head
    and, bending forward, struck his armed heels
    against the panting sides of his poor jade
    up to the rowel-head; and starting so,
    he seem'd in running to devour the way,
    staying no longer question.
  northumberland. ha! again:
    said he young harry percy's spur was cold?
    of hotspur, coldspur? that rebellion
    had met ill luck?
  lord bardolph. my lord, i'll tell you what:
    if my young lord your son have not the day,
    upon mine honour, for a silken point
    i'll give my barony. never talk of it.
  northumberland. why should that gentleman that rode by travers
    give then such instances of loss?
  lord bardolph. who- he?
    he was some hilding fellow that had stol'n
    the horse he rode on and, upon my life,
    spoke at a venture. look, here comes m

ce with life he never more sprung up.
    in few, his death- whose spirit lent a fire
    even to the dullest peasant in his camp-
    being bruited once, took fire and heat away
    from the best-temper'd courage in his troops;
    for from his metal was his party steeled;
    which once in him abated, an the rest
    turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.
    and as the thing that's heavy in itself
    upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
    so did our men, heavy in hotspur's loss,
    lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
    that arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
    than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
    fly from the field. then was that noble worcester
    too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious scot,
    the bloody douglas, whose well-labouring sword
    had three times slain th' appearance of the king,
    gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
    of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,

  hastings. with him, we may.
  lord bardolph. yea, marry, there's the point;
    but if without him we be thought too feeble,
    my judgment is we should not step too far
    till we had his assistance by the hand;
    for, in a theme so bloody-fac'd as this,
    conjecture, expectation, and surmise
    of aids incertain, should not be admitted.
  archbishop. 'tis very true, lord bardolph; for indeed
    it was young hotspur's case at shrewsbury.
  lord bardolph. it was, my lord; who lin'd himself with hope,
    eating the air and promise of supply,
    flatt'ring himself in project of a power
    much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts;
    and so, with great imagination
    proper to madmen, led his powers to death,
    and, winking, leapt into destruction.

    to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.

    would turn their own perfection to abuse
    to seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
    in diet, in affections of delight,
    in military rules, humours of blood,
    he was the mark and glass, copy and book,
    that fashion'd others. and him- o wondrous him!
    o miracle of men!- him did you leave-
    second to none, unseconded by you-
    to look upon the hideous god of war
    in disadvantage, to abide a field
    where nothing but the sound of hotspur's name
    did seem defensible. so you left him.
    never, o never, do his ghost the wrong
    to hold your honour more precise and nice
    with others than with him! let them alone.
