what can she become? i asked.

why, she said, the mother of his children.

but i am not the mother of anybody's children, i said, and i am something.

you are not much, she said. the missionary's drudge.

it is true that i work harder here than i ever dreamed i could work, and that i sweep out the school and tidy up after
service, but i don't feel like a drudge. i was surprised that this woman, whose christian name is catherine, saw me in this
light.

she has a little girl, tashi, who plays with olivia after school. adam is the only boy who will speak to olivia at school. they
are not mean to her, it is just— what is it? because she is where they are doing "boys' things" they do not see her. but
never fear, celie, olivia has your stubbornness and clearsightedness, and she is smarter than all of them, including adam,
put together.

why can't tashi come to school? she asked me. when i told her the olinka don't believe in educating girls she said, quick
as a flash. they'

oh, she's sharp, celie. at the end of the day, when tashi can get away from all the chores her mother assigns her, she and
olivia secret themselves in my hut and everything olivia has learned she shares with tashi. to olivia right now tashi alone
is africa. the africa she came beaming across the ocean hoping to find. everything else is difficult for her.

the insects, for instance. for some reason, all of her bites turn into deep, runny sores, and she has a lot of trouble
sleeping at night because the noises from the forest frighten her. it is taking a long time for her to become used to the
food, which is nourishing but, for the most part, indifferently prepared. the women of the village take turns cooking for

why do they say i will be a wife of the chief? asks olivia.

that is as high as they can think, i tell her.

fie is fat and shiny with huge perfect teeth. she thinks she has nightmares about him.

you will grow up to be a strong christian woman, i tell her. someone who helps her people to advance. you will be a
teacher or a nurse. you will travel. you will know many people greater than the chief.

will tashi? she wants to know.

yes, i tell her, tashi too.

corrine said to me this morning, nettie, to stop any kind of confusion in the minds of these people, i think we should call
one another brother and sister, all the time. some of them can't seem to get it through their thick skulls that you are not
samuel's other wife. i don't like it, she said.

almost since the day we arrived i've noticed a change in corrine. she isn't sick. she works as hard as ever. she is still
sweet and good-natured. but so

maybe one day i'll put them up, but once, when i held them up to my fabric and mat covered walls they made me feel
very small and unhappy, so i took them down. even the picture of christ which generally looks good anywhere looks
peculiar here. we of course have all of these pictures hung in the school and many of christ behind the altar at the
church. that is enough, i think, though samuel and corrine have pictures and relics (crosses) in their hut as well.

your sister, nettie


dear celie,


tashi's mother and father were just here. they are upset because she spends so much time with olivia. she is changing,
becoming quiet and too thoughtful, they say. she is becoming someone else; her face is beginning to show the spirit of
one of her aunts who was sold to the trader because she no longer fit into village life. this aunt refused to marry the man
chosen for her. refused to bow to the chief. did nothing but lay up, crack cola nuts between her teeth and giggle.

they want to know what oliv

ia and tashi do in my hut when all the other little girls are busy helping their mothers.

is tashi lazy at home? i asked.

the father looked at the mother. she said. no, on the contrary, tashi works harder than most girls her age. and is quicker
to finish her work. but it is only because she wishes to spend her afternoons with olivia. she learns everything i teach her
as if she already knows it, said the mother, but this knowledge does not really enter her soul.

the mother seemed puzzled and afraid.

the father, angry.

i thought: aha. tashi knows she is learning a way of life she will never live. but i did not say this.

the world is changing, i said. it is no longer a world just f

men.

our women are respected here, said the father. we would never let them tramp the world as american women do. there
is always someone to look after the olinka woman. a father. an uncle. a brother or nephew. do not be offended. sister
nettie, but our people pity women such as you who are cast out, we know not from where, into a world unknown to you,
where you must struggle all alone, for yourself.

so i am an object of pity and contempt, i thought, to men and women alike.

furthermore, said tashi's father, we are not simpletons. we understand that there are places in the world where women
live differently from the way our women do, but we do not approve of this different way for our children.

but life is changing, even in olinka, i said. we are here.

he spat on the ground. what are you? three grownups and two children. in the rainy season some of you will probably
die. you people do not last long in our climate. if you do not die, you will be weakened by illness. oh, yes. we have seen

all before. you christians come here, try hard to change us, get sick and go back to england, or wherever you come from.
only the trader on the coast remains, and even he is not the same white man, year in and year out. we know because we
send him women.

tashi is very intelligent, i said. she could be a teacher. a nurse. she could help the people in the village.

there is no place here for a woman to do those things, he said.

then we should leave, i said. sister corrine and i.

no, no, he said.

teach only the boys? i asked.

yes, he said, as if my question was agreement.

there is a way that the men speak to women that reminds me too much of pa. they listen just long enough to issue
instructions. they don't even look at women when women are speakin

g. they look at the ground and bend their heads
toward the ground. the women also do not "look in a man's face" as they say. to "look in a man's face" is a brazen thing
to do. they look instead at his feet or his knees. and what can i say to this? again, it is our own behavior around pa.

next time tashi appears at your gate, you will send her straight home, her father said. then he smiled. your olivia can
visit her, and learn what women are for.

i smiled also. olivia must learn to take her education about life where she can find it, i thought. his offer will make a
splendid opportunity.

good-bye until the next time, dear celie, from a pitiful, castout woman who may perish during the rainy season.

your loving sister, nettie


dear celie,


at first there was the faintest sound of movement in

asked me not to invite samuel to my hut unless she were present. she said it gave the
villagers the wrong idea. this was a real blow to me because i treasure his company. since corrine almost never visits me
herself i will have hardly anybody to talk to, just in friendship. but the children still come and sometimes spend the night
when their parents want to be alone. i love those times. we roast groundnuts on my stove, sit on the floor and study
maps of all the countries in the world. sometimes tashi comes over and tells stories that are popular among the olinka
children. i am encouraging her and olivia to write them down in olinka and english. it will be good practice for them.
olivia feels that, compared to tashi, she has no good stories to tell. one day she started in on an "uncle remus" tale only
to discover tashi had the original version of it! her little face just fell. but then we got into a discussion of how tashi's
people's stories got to america, which fascinated tashi. she cried

treated as a slave.

no one else in this village wants to hear about slavery, however. they acknowledge no responsibility whatsoever. this is
one thing about them that i definitely do not like.

we lost tashi's father during the last rainy season. he fell ill with malaria and nothing the healer concocted saved him. he
refused to take the medicine we use for it, or to let samuel visit him at all. it was my first olinka funeral. the women paint
their faces white and wear white shroudlike garments and cry in a high keening voice. they wrapped the body in
barkcloth and buried it under a big tree in the forest. tashi was heartbroken. all her young life she has tried to please her
father, never quite real

izing that, as a girl, she never could. but the death brought her and her mother closer together,
and now catherine feels like one of us. by one of us i mean me and the children and sometimes samuel. she is still in
mourning and sticking close to her hut, but she says she will not marry again (since she already has five boy children she
can now do whatever she wants. she has become an honorary man) and when i went to visit her she made it very clear
that tashi must continue to learn. she is the most industrious of all tashi's father's widows, and her fields are praised for
their cleanliness, productivity and general attractiveness. perhaps i can help her with her work. it is in work that the
women get to know and care about each other. it was through work that catherine became friends with her husband's
other wives.

this friendship among women is something samuel often talks about. because the women share a husband but the
husband does not share the

f anything.
you should just see how they make admiration over them. praise their smallest accomplishments. stuff them with palm
wine and sweets. no wonder the men are often childish. and a grown child is a dangerous thing, especially since, among
the olinka, the husband has life and death power over the wife. if he accuses one of his wives of witchcraft or infidelity,
she can be killed.

thank god (and sometimes samuel's intervention) this has not happened since we've been here. but the stories tashi
tells are often about such gruesome events that happened in the recent past. and god forbid that the child of a favorite
wife should fall ill! that is the point at which even the women's friendships break down, as each woman fears the
accusation of sorcery from the other, or from the husband.

merry christmas to you and yours, dear celie. we celebrate it here on the "dark" continent with prayer and song and a
large picnic complete with watermelon, fresh fruit punch, and barbecue!

god bless you

te man is not alone, said the chief. he has brought his army.

that was several months ago, and so far nothing has happened. the people live like ostriches, never setting foot on the
new road if they can help it, and never, ever, looking towards the coast. we have built another church and school. i have
another hut. and so we wait.

meanwhile, corrine has been very ill with african fever. many missionaries in the past have died from it.

but the children are fine. the boys now accept olivia and tashi in class and more mothers are sending their daughters to
school. the men do not like it: who wants a wife who knows everything her husband knows? they fume. but the women
have their ways, and they love their children, even their girls.

i will write more when things start looking up. i trust god they will.

dearest celie,


just when i think i've learned to live with the heat, the constant dampness, even steaminess of my clothes, the
swampiness under my arms and between my legs, my friend comes. and cramps and aches and pains— but i must still
keep going as if nothing is happening, or be an embarrassment to samuel, the children and myself. not to mention the
villagers, who think women who have their friends should not even be seen.

right after her mother's death, olivia got her friend; she and tashi tend to each other is my guess. nothing is said to me,
in any event, and i don't know how to bring the subject up. which feels wrong to me; but if you talk to an olinka girl
about her private parts, her mother and father will be annoyed, and it is very important to olivia not to be looked upon as
an outsider. although the one ritual they do have to celebrate womanhood is so bloody and painful, i forbid olivia to even
think about it.

do you remember how scared i was when it first happened to me

ithout a single word from you. only the sky above us do
we hold in common. i look at it often as if, somehow, reflected from its immensities, i will one day find myself gazing into
your eyes. your dear, large, clean and beautiful eyes. oh, celie! my life here is nothing but work, work, work, and worry.
what girlhood i might have had passed me by. and i have nothing of my own. no man, no children, no close friend,
except for samuel. but i do have children, adam and olivia. and i do have friends, tashi and catherine. i even have a
family— this village, which has fallen on such hard times.

now the engineers have come to inspect the territory. two white men came yesterday and spent a couple of hours
strolling about the village, mainly looking at the wells. such is the innate politeness of the olinka that they rushed about
preparing food for them, though precious little is left, since many of the gardens that flourish at this time of the year have
been destroyed. and the white men sat eating

an, your sister? asked olivia.

i explained your marriage to mr. as best i could.

adam was instantly alarmed. he is a very sensitive soul who hears what isn't said as clearly as what is.

we will go back to america soon, said samuel to reassure him, and see about her.

the children stood up with us in a simple church ceremony in london. and it was that night, after the wedding dinner,
when we were all getting ready for bed, that olivia told me what has been troubling her brother. he is missing tashi.

but he's also very angry with her, she said, because when we left, she was planning to scar her face.

i didn't know this. one of the things we thought we'd helped stop was the scarring or cutting of tribal marks on the faces
of young women.

it is a way the olinka can show they still have their own ways, said olivia, even though the white man has taken
everything else. tashi didn't want to do it, but to make her people feel better, she's resigned. she's going to have the

oh, no, i said. that's so dangerous. suppose she becomes infected?

i know, said olivia. i told her nobody in america or europe cuts off pieces of themselves. and anyway, she would have had
it when she was eleven, if she was going to have it she's too old for it now.

well, some men are circumcized, i said, but that's just the removal of a bit of skin.

tashi was happy that the initiation ceremony isn't done in europe or america, said olivia. that makes it even more
valuable to her.

i see, i said.

she and adam had an awful fight. not like any they've had before. he wasn't teasing her or chasing her around the village
or trying to tie roofleaf twigs in her hair. he was mad enough to strike her.

well, it's a good thing he didn't, i said. tashi would have jammed his head through her rug loom.

i'll be glad when we get back home, said olivia. adam is

sometimes you don't know, i said.

he is a beautiful young man, celie. tall and broad-shouldered, with a deep, thoughtful voice. did i tell you he writes
verses? and loves to sing? he's a son to make you proud.

rned home everyone seemed happy to see us. when we told them our appeal to the church and the
missionary society failed, they were disappointed. they literally wiped the smiles off their faces along with the sweat, and
returned, dejected, to their barracks. we went on to our building, a combination church, house and school, and began to
unpack our things.

the children... i realize i shouldn't call them children, they're grown, went in search of tashi; an hour later they returned
dumbfounded. they discovered no sign of her. catherine, her mother, is planting rubber trees some distance from the
compound, they were told. but no one had seen tashi all day.

olivia was very disappointed. adam was trying to appear unconcerned, but i noticed he was absentmindedly biting the
skin around his nails.

after two days it became clear that tashi was deliberately hiding. her friends said while we were away she'd undergone

tired. her face was still swollen from half a dozen small, neat incisions high on each cheek. when she put out her hand to
adam he refused to take it. he just looked at her scars, turned on his heel and left.

she and olivia hugged. but it was a quiet, heavy embrace. nothing like the boisterous, giggling behavior i expect from
them.

and cotton and a place for the children to cry and nurse their wounds.

each day adam presses us to leave for home. he can no longer bear living as we do. there aren't even any trees near us,
just giant boulders and smaller rocks. and more and more of his companions are running away. the real reason, of
course, is he can no longer bear his conflicting feelings about tashi, who is beginning, i think, to appreciate the magnitude
of her mistake.

samuel and i are truly happy, celie. and so grateful to god that we are! we still keep a school for the littlest children;
those eight and over are already workers in the fields. in order to pay rent for the barracks, taxes on the land, and to buy
water and wood and food, everyone must work. so, we teach the young ones, babysit the babies, look after the old and
sick, and attend birthing mothers. our days are fuller than e

tashi and her mother have run away. they have gone to join the mbeles. samuel and the children and i were discussing it
just yesterday, and we realized we do not even know for sure the mbeles exist. all we know is that they are said to live
deep in the forest, that they welcome runaways, and that they harass the white man's plantations and plan his
destruction— or at least for his removal from their continent.

adam and olivia are heartbroken because they love tashi and miss her, and because no one

ckening and dying at an alarming rate.

to tell you the truth, i fear for our own health, and especially for the children. but samuel feels we will probably be all
right, having had bouts with malaria during the first years we were here.

and how are you, dearest sister? nearly thirty years have passed without a word between us. for all i know you may be
dead. as the time nears for us to come home, adam and olivia ask endless questions about you, few of which i can
answer. sometimes i tell them tashi reminds me of you. and, because there is no one finer to them than tashi, they glow
with delight. but will you still have tashi's honest and open spirit, i wonder, when we see you again? or will years of

childbearing and abuse from mr. have destroyed it? these are thoughts i don't pursue with the children, only with

my beloved companion, samuel, who advises me not to worry, to trust in god, and to have faith in the sturdiness of my

dear celie,


after two and a half months adam and tashi returned! adam overtook tashi and her mother and some other members of
our compound as they were nearing the village where the white woman missionary had lived, but tashi would not hear of
turning back, nor would catherine, and so adam accompanied them to the mbeles encampment.

oh, he says, it is the most extraordinary place!

you know, celie, in africa there is a huge depression in the earth called the great rift valley, but it is on the other side of
the continent from where we are. however,
 
 ___________________________
 
s, from the air, and then it would seem just an overgrown canyon. well, in this overgrown
canyon are a thousand people from dozens of african tribes, and even one colored man— adam swears— from alabama!
there are farms. there is a school. an infirmary. a temple. and there are male and female warriors who do indeed go on
missions of sabotage against the white plantations.

but all this seemed more a marvel in the recounting than in the actual experiencing of it, if i am any judge of adam and
tashi. their minds seem to have been completely riveted on each other.

i wish you could have seen them as they staggered into the compound. filthy as hogs, hair as wild as could be. sleepy.
exhausted. smelly. god knows. but still arguing.

just because i came back with you, don't think i am saying yes to marriage, says tashi.

oh yes you are, says adam, heatedly, but through a yawn. you promised your mother. / promised your mother.

nobody in america will like me, says tashi.

i will like you, says

adam.

olivia ran and enfolded tashi in her arms. ran about preparing food and a bath.

last night, after tashi and adam had slept most of the day, we had a family conference. we informed them that because
so many of our people had gone to join the mbeles and the planters were beginning to bring in moslem workers from the
north, and because it was time for us to do so, we would be leaving for home in a matter of weeks.

adam announced his desire to marry tashi.

tashi announced her refusal to be married.

and then, in that honest, forthright way of hers, she gave her reasons. paramount among them that, because of the
scarification marks on her cheeks americans would look down on her as a savage and shun her, and whatever children
she and adam might have. that she had seen the magazines we receive from home and that it was very clear to her that
black people did not truly admire blackskinned black people like herself, and especially did not admire blackskinne

women. they bleach their faces, she said. they fry their hair. they try to look naked.

also, she continued, i fear adam will be distracted by one of these naked looking women and desert me. then i would
have no country, no people, no mother and no husband and brother.

you'd have a sister, said olivia.

then adam spoke. he asked tashi to forgive his initial stupid response to the scarification. and to forgive the repugnance
he'd felt about the female initiation ceremony. he assured tashi that it was she he loved and that in america she would
have country, people, parents, sister, husband, brother and lover, and that whatever befell her in america would also be
his own choice and his own lot.

oh, celie.

so, the next day, our boy came to us with scars identical to tashi's on his cheeks.

and they are so happy. so happy, celie. tashi and adam omatangu.

samuel married them, of course, and all the people left in the compound came to wish them happiness and an
abundance of rooflea
