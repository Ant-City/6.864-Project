the baron's lady weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, and was therefore a person of great consideration, and she did the honours of the house with a dignity that commanded still greater respect. her daughter cunegonde was seventeen years of age, fresh-coloured, comely, plump, and desirable. the baron's son seemed to be in every respect worthy of his father. the preceptor pangloss[1] was the oracle of the family, and little candide heard his lessons with all the good faith of his age and character.

pangloss was professor of metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology. he proved admirably that there is no effect without a cause, and that, in this best of all possible worlds, the baron's castle was the most magnif

candide listened attentively and believed innocently; for he thought miss cunegonde extremely beautiful, though he never had the courage to tell her so. he concluded that after the happiness of being born of baron of thunder-ten-tronckh, the second degree of happiness was to be miss cunegonde, the third that of seeing her every day, and the fourth that of hearing master pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the whole province, and consequently of the whole world.

"come, sir, seat yourself; not only will we pay your reckoning, but we will never suffer such a man as you to want money; men are only born to assist one another."

"you are right," said candide; "this is what i was always taught by mr. pangloss, and i see plainly that all is for the best."

they begged of him to accept a few crowns. he took them, and wished to give them his note; they refused; they seated themselves at table.

"love you not deeply?"

"oh yes," answered he; "i deeply love miss cunegonde."

"no," said one of the gentlemen, "we ask you if you do not deeply love the king of the bulgarians?"

"not at all," said he; "for i have never seen him."

"what! he is the best of kings, and we must drink his health."

"oh! very willingly, gentlemen," and he drank.

"that is enough," they tell him. "now you[pg 7] are the help, the support, the defender, the hero of the bulgarians. your fortune is made, and your glory is assured."

instantly they fettered him, and carried him away to the regim

s, disembowelled and breathing their last after having satisfied the natural wants of bulgarian heroes; while others, half burnt in the flames, begged to be despatched. the earth was strewed with brains, arms, and legs.

candide fled quickly to another village; it belonged to the bulgarians; and the abarian heroes had treated it in the same way. candide, walking always over palpitating limbs or across ruins, arrived at last beyond the seat of war, with a few provisions in his knapsack, and miss cunegonde always in his heart. his provisions failed him when he arrived in holland; but having heard that everybody was rich in that country, and that they were christians, he did not doubt but he should meet with the same treatment from them as he had met with in the baron's castle, before miss cunegonde's bright eyes were the cause of his expulsion thence.

he asked alms of several grave-looking people, who all answered him, that if he continued to follow this trade they would confine him to the house

 of correction, where he should be taught to get a living.[pg 11]

the next he addressed was a man who had been haranguing a large assembly for a whole hour on the subject of charity. but the orator, looking askew, said:

"what are you doing here? are you for the good cause?"

"there can be no effect without a cause," modestly answered candide; "the whole is necessarily concatenated and arranged for the best. it was necessary for me to have been banished from the presence of miss cunegonde, to have afterwards run the gauntlet, and now it is necessary i should beg my bread until i learn to earn it; all this cannot be otherwise."

"my friend," said the orator to him, "do you believe the pope to be anti-christ?"

"i have not heard it," answered candide; "but whether he be, or whether he be not, i want bread."

"thou dost not deserve to eat," said the other. "begone, rogue; begone, wretch; do not come near me again."

the orator's wife, putting her head out of the window, and spying

with horror, gave to this shocking beggar the two florins which he had received from the honest anabaptist james. the spectre looked at him very earnestly, dropped a few tears, and fell upon his neck. candide recoiled in disgust.

"alas!" said one wretch to the other, "do you no longer know your dear pangloss?"

"what do i hear? you, my dear master! you in this terrible plight! what misfortune has happened to you? why are you no longer in the most magnificent of castles? what has become of miss cunegonde, the pearl of girls, and nature's masterpiece?"

"i am so weak that i cannot stand," said pangloss.

upon which candide carried him to the anabaptist's stable, and gave him a crust of bread. as soon as pangloss had refreshed himself a little:

"well," said candide, "cunegonde?"[pg 14]

"she is dead," replied the other.

candide fainted at this word; his friend recalled his senses with a little bad vinegar which he found by chance in the stable. candide reopened his eyes.

"cunegonde is dead! ah

candide, terrified, amazed, desperate, all bloody, all palpitating, said to himself:

"if this is the best of possible worlds, what then are the others? well, if i had been only whipped i could put up with it, for i experienced that among the bulgarians; but oh, my dear pangloss! thou greatest of philosophers, that i should have seen you hanged, without knowing for what! oh, my dear anabaptist, thou best of men, that thou should'st have been drowned in the very harbour! oh, miss cunegonde, thou pearl of girls! that thou should'st have had thy belly ripped open!"[pg 25]

thus he was musing, scarce able to stand, preached at, whipped, absolved, and blessed, when an old woman accosted him saying:

"my son, take courage and follow me."[pg 26]

candide did not take courage, but followed the old woman to a decayed house, where she gave him a pot of pomatum to anoint his sores, showed him a very neat li

 candide thought himself in a dream; indeed, that he had been dreaming unluckily all his life, and that the present moment was the only agreeable part of it all.

the old woman returned very soon, supporting with difficulty a trembling woman of a majestic figure, brilliant with jewels, and covered with a veil.

"take off that veil," said the old woman to candide.

the young man approaches, he raises the veil[pg 28] with a timid hand. oh! what a moment! what surprise! he believes he beholds miss cunegonde? he really sees her! it is herself! his strength fails him, he cannot utter a word, but drops at her feet. cunegonde falls upon the sofa. the old woman supplies a smelling bottle; they come to themselves and recover their speech. as they began with broken accents, with questions and answers interchangeably interrupted with sighs, with tears, and cries. the old woman desired they would make less noise and then she left them to themselves.

"what, is it you?" said candide, "you live? i find you a

"yes, they did," said the beautiful cunegonde; "but those two accidents are not always mortal."

"but were your father and mother killed?"

"it is but too true," answered cunegonde, in tears.

"and your brother?"

"my brother also was killed."

"and why are you in portugal? and how did you know of my being here? and by what strange adventure did you contrive to bring me to this house?"

"i will tell you all that," replied the lady, "but first of all let me know your history, since[pg 29] the innocent kiss you gave me and the kicks which you received."

candide respectfully obeyed her, and though he was still in a surprise, though his voice was feeble and trembling, though

 his back still pained him, yet he gave her a most ingenuous account of everything that had befallen him since the moment of their separation. cunegonde lifted up her eyes to heaven; shed tears upon hearing of the death of the good anabaptist and of pangloss; after which she spoke as follows to candide, who did not lose a word and devoured her with his eyes.[pg 30]

the history of cunegonde.

"i was in bed and fast asleep when it pleased god to send the bulgarians to our delightful castle of thunder-ten-tronckh; they slew my father and brother, and cut my mother in pieces. a tall bulgarian, six feet high, perceiving that i had fainted away at this sight, began to ravish me; this made me recover; i regained my senses, i cried, i struggled, i bit, i scratched, i wanted to tear out the tall bulgarian's eyes—not knowing that what happened at my father's house was the usual practice

of war. the brute gave me a cut in the left side with his hanger, and the mark is still upon me."

"ah! i hope i shall see it," said honest candide.

"you shall," said cunegonde, "but let us continue."

"do so," replied candide.

thus she resumed the thread of her story:

"a bulgarian captain came in, saw me all bleeding, and the soldier not in the least disconcerted. the captain flew into a passion at[pg 31] the disrespectful behaviour of the brute, and slew him on my body. he ordered my wounds to be dressed, and took me to his quarters as a prisoner of war. i washed the few shirts that he had, i did his cooking; he thought me very pretty—he avowed it; on the other

e has executed her commission perfectly well; i have tasted the inexpressible pleasure of seeing you again, of hearing you, of speaking with you. but you must be hungry, for myself, i am famished; let us have supper."

they both sat down to table, and, when supper was over, they placed themselves once more on the sofa; where they were when signor don issachar arrived. it was the jewish sabbath, and issachar had come to enjoy his rights, and to explain his tender love.[pg 35]

ix

what became of cunegonde, candide, the grand inquisitor, and the jew.

this issachar was the most choleric hebrew that had ever been seen in israel since the captivity in babylon.

"what!" said he, "thou bitch of a galilean, was not the inquisitor enough for thee? must this rascal also share with me?"

in saying this he drew a long poniard which he always carried about him; and not imagining that his adversary had any arms he threw himself upon candide: but our honest westphalian had received a handsome sword from the

old woman along with the suit of clothes. he drew his rapier, despite his gentleness, and laid the israelite stone dead upon the cushions at cunegonde's feet.

"holy virgin!" cried she, "what will become of us? a man killed in my apartment! if the officers of justice come, we are lost!"

"had not pangloss been hanged," said candide, "he would give us good counsel in this[pg 36] emergency, for he was a profound philosopher. failing him let us consult the old woman."

she was very prudent and commenced to give her opinion when suddenly another little door opened. it was an hour after midnight, it was the beginning of sunday. this day belonged t

o my lord the inquisitor. he entered, and saw the whipped candide, sword in hand, a dead man upon the floor, cunegonde aghast, and the old woman giving counsel.

at this moment, the following is what passed in the soul of candide, and how he reasoned:

if this holy man call in assistance, he will surely have me burnt; and cunegonde will perhaps be served in the same manner; he was the cause of my being cruelly whipped; he is my rival; and, as i have now begun to kill, i will kill away, for there is no time to hesitate. this reasoning was clear and instantaneous; so that without giving time to the inquisitor to recover from his surprise, he pierced him through and through, and cast him beside the jew.

"yet again!" said cunegonde, "now there is no mercy for us, we are excommunicated, our last hour has come. how could you d

ped by the inquisition, one stops at nothing."

the old woman then put in her word, saying:

"there are three andalusian horses in the stable with bridles and saddles, let the brave candide get them ready; madame has money, jewels; let us therefore mount quickly on horseback, though i can sit only on one buttock; let us set out for cadiz, it is the finest weather in the world, and there is great pleasure in travelling in the cool of the night."

immediately candide saddled the three horses, and cunegonde, the old woman and he, travelled thirty miles at a stretch. while they were journeying, the holy brotherhood entered the house; my lord the inquisitor was interred in a handsome church, and issachar's body was thrown upon a dunghill.

candide, cunegonde, and the old woman, had now reached the little town of avacena in the midst of the mountains of the sierra morena, and were speaking as follows in a public inn.[pg 38]

and of their embarkation.

"who was it that robbed me of my money and jewels?" said cunegonde, all bathed in tears. "how shall we live? what shall we do? where find inquisitors or jews who will give me more?"

"alas!" said the old woman, "i have a shrewd suspicion of a reverend grey friar, who stayed last night in the same inn with us at badajos. god preserve me from judging rashly, but he came into our room twice, and he set out upon his journey long before us."

"alas!" said candide, "dear pangloss has often demonstrated to me that the goods of this world are common to all men, and th

at each has an equal right to them. but according to these principles the grey friar ought to have left us enough to carry us through our journey. have you nothing at all left, my dear cunegonde?"

"not a farthing," said she.

"what then must we do?" said candide.

"sell one of the horses," replied the old[pg 39] woman. "i will ride behind miss cunegonde, though i can hold myself only on one buttock, and we shall reach cadiz."

in the same inn there was a benedictine prior who bought the horse for a cheap price. candide, cunegonde, and the old woman, having passed through lucena, chillas, and lebrixa, arrived at length at cadiz. a fleet was there getting ready, and troops assembling to bring to reason the reverend jesuit fathers of paraguay, accused of having made one of the native tribes in the neighborhood of san sacrament revolt against the

kings of spain and portugal. candide having been in the bulgarian service, performed the military exercise before the general of this little army with so graceful an address, with so intrepid an air, and with such agility and expedition, that he was given the command of a company of foot. now, he was a captain! he set sail with miss cunegonde, the old woman, two valets, and the two andalusian horses, which had belonged to the grand inquisitor of portugal.

during their voyage they reasoned a good deal on the philosophy of poor pangloss.

"we are going into another world," said candide; "and surely it must be there that all is for the best. for i must confess there is reason to complain a little of what passeth in[pg 40] our world in regard to both natural and moral philosophy."

"i love you with all my heart," said cunegonde; "but m

y soul is still full of fright at that which i have seen and experienced."

"all will be well," replied candide; "the sea of this new world is already better than our european sea; it is calmer, the winds more regular. it is certainly the new world which is the best of all possible worlds."

"god grant it," said cunegonde; "but i have been so horribly unhappy there that my heart is almost closed to hope."

"you complain," said the old woman; "alas! you have not known such misfortunes as mine."

cunegonde almost broke out laughing, finding the good woman very amusing, for pretending to have been as unfortunate as she.

"alas!" said cunegonde, "my good mother, unless you have been ravished by two bulgarians, have received two deep wounds in your belly, have had two castles demolished, have had two mothers cut to pieces before your eyes, and two of your lovers whipped at an auto-da-fé, i do not conceive how you could be more unfortunate than i. add that i was born a baroness of seventy-two quarte

"miss," replied the old woman, "you do not[pg 41] know my birth; and were i to show you my backside, you would not talk in that manner, but would suspend your judgment."

this speech having raised extreme curiosity in the minds of cunegonde and candide, the old woman spoke to them as follows.[pg 42]

history of the old woman.

"i had not always bleared eyes and red eyelids; neither did my nose always touch my chin; nor was i always a servant. i am the daughter of pope urban x,[10] and of the princess of palestrina. until the age of fourteen i was brought up in a palace, to which all the castles of your german barons would scarcely have served for stables; and one of my robes was worth more than all the magnificence of westphal

"never," answered cunegonde.

"if you had," said the old woman, "you would acknowledge that it is far more terrible[pg 50] than an earthquake. it is common in africa, and i caught it. imagine to yourself the distressed situation of the daughter of a pope, only fifteen years old, who, in less than three months, had felt the miseries of poverty and slavery, had been ravished almost every day, had beheld her mother drawn in quarters, had experienced famine and war, and was dying of the plague in algiers. i did not die, howev

how candide was forced away from his fair cunegonde and the old woman.

the beautiful cunegonde having heard the old woman's history, paid her

he other, to relate their adventures; and then both she and candide allowed that the old woman was in the right.

"it is a great pity," said candide, "that the sage pangloss was hanged contrary to custom at an auto-da-fé; he would tell us most amazing things in regard to the physical and moral evils that overspread earth and sea, and i should be able, with due respect, to make a few objections."

while each passenger was recounting his story, the ship made her way. they landed at buenos ayres. cunegonde, captain candide, and the old woman, waited on the governor, don fernando d'ibaraa, y figueora, y mascarenes, y lampourdos, y souza. this nobleman had a stateliness becoming a person who bore so many[pg 55] names. he spoke to men with so noble a disdain, carried his nose so loftily, raised his voice so unmercifully, assumed so imperious an air, and stalked with such intolerable pride, that those who saluted him were strongly inclined to give him a good drubbing. cunegonde appeared to him the mo

st beautiful he had ever met. the first thing he did was to ask whether she was not the captain's wife. the manner in which he asked the question alarmed candide; he durst not say she was his wife, because indeed she was not; neither durst he say she was his sister, because it was not so; and although this obliging lie had been formerly much in favour among the ancients, and although it could be useful to the moderns, his soul was too pure to betray the truth.

"miss cunegonde," said he, "is to do me the honour to marry me, and we beseech your excellency to deign to sanction our marriage."

don fernando d'ibaraa, y figueora, y mascarenes, y lampourdos, y souza, turning up his moustachios, smiled mockingly, and ordered captain candide to go and review his company. candide obeyed, and the governor remained alone with miss cunegonde. he declared his passion, protesting he would marry her the next day in the face of the church, or otherwise, just as should be agreeable t

o herself. cunegonde[pg 56] asked a quarter of an hour to consider of it, to consult the old woman, and to take her resolution.

the old woman spoke thus to cunegonde:

"miss, you have seventy-two quarterings, and not a farthing; it is now in your power to be wife to the greatest lord in south america, who has very beautiful moustachios. is it for you to pique yourself upon inviolable fidelity? you have been ravished by bulgarians; a jew and an inquisitor have enjoyed your favours. misfortune gives sufficient excuse. i own, that if i were in your place, i should have no scruple in marrying the governor and in making the fortune of captain candide."

while th

e old woman spoke with all the prudence which age and experience gave, a small ship entered the port on board of which were an alcalde and his alguazils, and this was what had happened.

as the old woman had shrewdly guessed, it was a grey friar who stole cunegonde's money and jewels in the town of badajos, when she and candide were escaping. the friar wanted to sell some of the diamonds to a jeweller; the jeweller knew them to be the grand inquisitor's. the friar before he was hanged confessed he had stolen them. he described the persons, and the route they had taken. the flight of cunegonde[pg 57] and candide was already known. they were traced to cadiz. a vessel was immediately sent in pursuit of them. the vessel was already in the port of buenos ayres

. the report spread that the alcalde was going to land, and that he was in pursuit of the murderers of my lord the grand inquisitor. the prudent old woman saw at once what was to be done.

"you cannot run away," said she to cunegonde, "and you have nothing to fear, for it was not you that killed my lord; besides the governor who loves you will not suffer you to be ill-treated; therefore stay."

she then ran immediately to candide.

"fly," said she, "or in an hour you will be burnt."

there was not a moment to lose; but how could he part from cunegonde, and where could he flee for shelter?[pg 58]

how candide and cacambo were received by the jesuits of paraguay.

candide had brought such a valet with him from cadiz, as 
 
 ___________________________
 
one often meets with on the coasts of spain and in the american colonies. he was a quarter spaniard, born of a mongrel in tucuman; he had been singing-boy, sacristan, sailor, monk, pedlar, soldier, and lackey. his name was cacambo, and he loved his master, because his master was a very good man. he quickly saddled the two andalusian horses.

"come, master, let us follow the old woman's advice; let us start, and run without looking behind us."

candide shed tears.

"oh! my dear cunegonde! must i leave you just at a time when the governor was going to sanction our nuptials? cunegonde, brought to such a distance what will become of you?"

"she will do as well as she can," said cacambo; "the women are never at a loss, god provides for them, let us run."

"whither art thou carrying me? where shall[pg 59] we go? what shall we do without cunegonde?" said candide.

"by st. james of compostella," said cacambo, "you were going to fight against the jesuits; let us go to fight for them; i

 as they could not conceal.

"and from what part of germany do you come?" said the jesuit.

"i am from the dirty province of westphalia," answered candide; "i was born in the castle of thunder-ten-tronckh."

"oh! heavens! is it possible?" cried the commandant.

"what a miracle!" cried candide.

"is it really you?" said the commandant.

"it is not possible!" said candide.

they drew back; they embraced; they shed rivulets of tears.

"what, is it you, reverend father? you, the brother of the fair cunegonde! you, that was slain by the bulgarians! you, the baron's son! you, a jesuit in paraguay! i must confess this is a strange world that we live in. oh, pangloss! pangloss! how glad you would be if you had not been hanged!"

the commandant sent away the negro slaves and the paraguayans, who served them with[pg 63] liquors in goblets of rock-crystal. he thanked god and st. ignatius a thousand times; he clasped candide in his arms; and their faces were all bathed with tears.

"you will be more surpri

"where?"

"in your neighbourhood, with the governor of buenos ayres; and i was going to fight against you."

every word which they uttered in this long conversation but added wonder to wonder. their souls fluttered on their tongues, listened in their ears, and sparkled in their eyes. as they were germans, they sat a good while at table, waiting for the reverend father provincial, and the commandant spoke to his dea

how candide killed the brother of his dear cunegonde.

"i shall have ever present to my memory the dreadful day, on which i saw my father and mother killed, and my sister ravished. when the bulgarians retired, my dear sister could not be found; but my mother, my father, and myself, with two maid-servants and three little boys all of whom had been slain, were put in a hearse, to be conveyed for interment to a chapel belonging to the jesuits, within two leagues of our family seat. a jesuit sprinkled us with some holy water; it was horribly salt; a

candide assured him on oath that nothing was more true, and their tears began afresh.

the baron could not refrain from embracing candide; he called him his brother, his saviour.

"ah! perhaps," said he, "we shall together, my dear candide, enter the town as conquerors, and recover my sister cunegonde."

"that is all i want," said candide, "for i intended to marry her, and i still hope to do so."

"you insolent!" replied the baron, "

"how can you ask me to eat ham," said candide, "after killing the baron's son, and being doomed never more to see the beautiful cunegonde? what will it avail me to spin out my wretched days and drag them far from her in remorse and despair? and what will the journal of trevoux[17] say?"

while he was thus lamenting his fate, he[pg 69] went on eating. the sun went down. the two wanderers heard some little cries which seemed to be uttered by women. they did not know whether they were cries of pain or joy; but they started up precipitately with that inquietude and alarm which every little thing inspires in an unknown country. the no

"a jesuit! a jesuit! we shall be revenged, we shall have excellent cheer, let us eat the jesuit, let us eat him up!"

"i told you, my dear master," cried cacambo sadly, "that those two girls would play us some ugly trick."

candide seeing the cauldron and the spits, cried:

"we are certainly going to be either roasted or boiled. ah! what would master pangloss say, were he to see how pure nature is formed? everything is right, may be, but i declare it is very hard to have lost miss cunegonde and to be put upon a spit by oreillons."

cacambo never lost his head.

"do not despair," said he to the disconsolate candide, "i understand a little of the jargon of these people, i will speak to them."

"be sure," said candide, "to represent to them[pg 72] how frightfully inhuman it is to cook men, and how very un-christian."

"gentlemen," said cacambo, "you reckon you are to-day going to feast upon a jesuit. it is all very well, nothing is more unjust than thus to treat your enemies. indeed,

matter; these executed their commission like men of sense, and soon returned with good news. the oreillons untied their prisoners, showed them all sorts of civilities, offered them girls, gave them refreshment, and reconducted them to the confines of their territories, proclaiming with great joy:

"he is no jesuit! he is no jesuit!"

candide could not help being surprised at the cause of his deliverance.

"what people!" said he; "what men! what manners! if i had not been so lucky as to run miss cunegonde's brother through the body, i should have been devoured without redemption. but, after all, pure nature is good, since these people, instead of feasting upon my flesh, have shown me a thousand civilities, when then i was not a jesuit."[pg 74]

arrival of candide and his valet at el dorado, and what they saw there.

"you see," said cacambo to candide, as soon as they had reached the frontiers of the oreillons, "that this hemisphere is not better than the others, take my word for it; let us

 go back to europe by the shortest way."

"how go back?" said candide, "and where shall we go? to my own country? the bulgarians and the abares are slaying all; to portugal? there i shall be burnt; and if we abide here we are every moment in danger of being spitted. but how can i resolve to quit a part of the world where my dear cunegonde resides?"

"let us turn towards cayenne," said cacambo, "there we shall find frenchmen, who wander all over the world; they may assist us; god will perhaps have pity on us."

it was not easy to get to cayenne; they knew vaguely in which direction to go, but rivers, precipices, robbers, savages, obstructed them all the way. their horses died of fatigue. their provisions were consumed; they fed a whole[pg 75] month upon wild fruits, and found themselves at last near a little river bordered with c

re a better entertainment, and never was more wit shown at a table than that which fell from his majesty. cacambo explained the king's bon-mots to candide, and notwithstanding they were translated they still appeared to be bon-mots. of all the things that surprised candide this was not the least.

they spent a month in this hospitable place. candide frequently said to cacambo:

"i own, my friend, once more that the castle where i was born is nothing in comparison with this; but, after all, miss cunegonde is not here, and you have, without doubt, some mistress in europe. if we abide here we shall only be upon a footing with the rest, whereas, if we return to our old world, only with twelve sheep laden with the pebbles of el dorado, we shall be richer than all the kings in europe. we shall have no more inquisitors to fear, and we may easily recover miss cunegonde."

this speech was agreeable to cacambo; mankind are so fond of roving, of making a figure in their own country, and of boasting of wha

tains, twenty pack-sheep laden with provisions, thirty with presents of the curiosities of the country, and fifty with gold, diamonds, and precious stones. the king embraced the two wanderers very tenderly.

their departure, with the ingenious manner in which they and their sheep were hoisted over the mountains, was a splendid spectacle. the mathematicians took their leave after conveying them to a place of safety, and candide had no other desire, no other aim, than to present his sheep to miss cunegonde.

"now," said he, "we are able to pay the governor of buenos ayres if miss cunegonde can be ransomed. let us journey towards cayenne. let us embark, and we will afterwards see what kingdom we shall be able to purchase."[pg 89]

what happened to them at surinam and how candide got acquainted with martin.

our travellers spent the first day very agreeably. they were delighted with possessing more treasure than all asia, europe, and africa could scrape together. candide, in his raptures, cut

cunegonde's name on the trees. the second day two of their sheep plunged into a morass, where they and their burdens were lost; two more died of fatigue a few days after; seven or eight perished with hunger in a desert; and others subsequently fell down precipices. at length, after travelling a hundred days, only two sheep remained. said candide to cacambo:

"my friend, you see how perishable are the riches of this world; there is nothing solid but virtue, and the happiness of seeing cunegonde once more."

"i grant all you say," said cacambo, "but we have still two sheep remaining, with more treasure than the king of spain will ever have; and i see a town which i take to be surinam, belonging[pg 90] to the dutch. we are at the end of all our troubles, and at the beginning of happiness."

as they drew near the town, they saw a negro stretched upon the ground, with only one moiety of his clothes, that is, of his blue linen drawers; the poor man had lost his left leg and his right hand.

first thing they inquired after was whether there was a vessel in the harbour which could be sent to buenos ayres. the person to whom they applied was a spanish sea-captain, who offered to agree with them upon reasonable terms. he appointed to meet them at a public-house, whither candide and the faithful cacambo[pg 92] went with their two sheep, and awaited his coming.

candide, who had his heart upon his lips, told the spaniard all his adventures, and avowed that he intended to elope with miss cunegonde.

"then i will take good care not to carry you to buenos ayres," said the seaman. "i should be hanged, and so would you. the fair cunegonde is my lord's favourite mistress."

this was a thunderclap for candide: he wept for a long while. at last he drew cacambo aside.

"here, my dear friend," said he to him, "this thou must do. we have, each of us in his pocket, five or six millions in diamonds; you are more clever than i; you must go and bring miss cunegonde from buenos ayres. if the governor m

what happened at sea to candide and martin.

the old philosopher, whose name was martin, embarked then with candide for bordeaux. they had both seen and suffered a great deal; and if the vessel had sailed from surinam to japan, by the cape of good hope, the subject of moral and natural evil would have enabled them to entertain one another during the whole voyage.

candide, however, had one great advantage over martin, in that he always hoped to see miss cunegonde; whereas martin had nothing at all to hope. besides, candide was possessed of money and jewels, and though he had lost one hundred large red sheep, laden with the greatest treasure upon earth; though the knavery of the dutch skipper still sat heavy upon his mind; yet when he reflected upon what he had still left, and when he mentioned the name of cunegonde, especially towards the latter end of a repast, he inclined to pangloss's doctrine.

"but you, mr. martin," said he to the philosopher,[pg 9
 
 ___________________________
 
ed also to destruction? god has punished the knave, and the devil has drowned the rest."

the french and spanish ships continued their course, and candide continued his conversation with martin. they disputed fifteen successive days, and on the last of those fifteen days, they were as far advanced as on the first. but, however, they chatted, they communicated ideas, they consoled each other. candide caressed his sheep.

"since i have found thee again," said he, "i may likewise chance to find my cunegonde."[pg 102]

candide and martin, reasoning, draw near the coast of france.

at length they descried the coast of france.

"were you ever in france, mr. martin?" said candide.

"yes," said martin, "i have been in several provinces. in some one-half of the people are fools, in others they are too cunning; in some they are weak and simple, in others they affect to be witty; in all, the principal occupation is love, the next is slander, and the third is talking nonsense."

"but, mr. martin, have

"for my part, i have no curiosity to see france," said candide. "you may easily imagine that after spending a month at el dorado i can desire to behold nothing upon earth but miss cunegonde. i go to await her at venice. we shall pass through france on our way to italy. will you bear me company?"

"with all my heart," said martin. "it is said that venice is fit only for its own nobility, but that strangers meet with a very good reception if they have a good deal of money. i have none of it; you have, therefore i will follow you all over the world."

"but do you believe," said candide, "that the earth was originally a sea, as we find it asserted in that large book belonging to the c

 i will bring you, to-morrow, twenty pamphlets written against him."[22]

"how many dramas have you in france, sir?" said candide to the abbé.

"five or six thousand."[pg 108]

"what a number!" said candide. "how many good?"

"fifteen or sixteen," replied the other.

"what a number!" said martin.

candide was very pleased with an actress who played queen elizabeth in a somewhat insipid tragedy[23] sometimes acted.

"that actress," said he to martin, "pleases me much; she has a likeness to miss cunegonde; i should be very glad to wait upon her."

the perigordian abbé offered to introduce him. candide, brought up in germany, asked what was the etiquette, and how they treated queens of england in france.

"it is necessary to make distinctions," said the abbé. "in the provinces one takes them to the inn; in paris, one respects them when they are beautiful, and throws them on the highway when they are dead."[24]

"queens on the highway!" said candide.

"yes, truly," said martin, "the abbé is rig

gains his livelihood by saying evil of all plays and of all books. he hates whatever succeeds, as the eunuchs hate those who enjoy; he is one of the serpents of literature who nourish themselves on dirt and spite; he is a folliculaire."

"what is a folliculaire?" said candide.

"it is," said the abbé, "a pamphleteer—a fréron."[25]

thus candide, martin, and the perigordian[pg 110] conversed on the staircase, while watching every one go out after the performance.

"although i am eager to see cunegonde again," said candide, "i should like to sup with miss clairon, for she appears to me admirable."

the abbé was not the man to approach miss clairon, who saw only good company.

"she is engaged for this evening," he said, "but i shall have the honour to take you to the house of a lady of quality, and there you will know paris as if you had lived in it for years."

candide, who was naturally curious, let himself be taken to this lady's house, at the end of the faubourg st. honoré. the company w

aid martin. "the shadows are horrible blots."[pg 115]

"they are men who make the blots," said candide, "and they cannot be dispensed with."

"it is not their fault then," said martin.

most of the punters, who understood nothing of this language, drank, and martin reasoned with the scholar, and candide related some of his adventures to his hostess.

after supper the marchioness took candide into her boudoir, and made him sit upon a sofa.

"ah, well!" said she to him, "you love desperately miss cunegonde of thunder-ten-tronckh?"

"yes, madame," answered candide.

the marchioness replied to him with a tender smile:

"you answer me like a young man from westphalia. a frenchman would have said, 'it is true that i have loved miss cunegonde, but seeing you, madame, i think i no longer love her.'"

"alas! madame," said candide, "i will answer you as you wish."

"your passion for her," said the marchioness, "commenced by picking up her handkerchief. i wish that you would pick up my garter."

"with all

ou see," said she, "you are a foreigner. i sometimes make my parisian lovers languish for fifteen days, but i give myself to you the first night because one must do the honours of one's country to a young man from westphalia."

the lady having perceived two enormous diamonds upon the hands of the young foreigner praised them with such good faith that from candide's fingers they passed to her own.

candide, returning with the perigordian abbé, felt some remorse in having been unfaithful to miss cunegonde. the abbé sympathised in his trouble; he had had but a light part of the fifty thousand francs lost at play and of the value of the two brilliants, half given, half extorted. his design was to profit as much as he could by the advantages which the acquaintance of candide could procure for him. he spoke much of cunegonde, and candide told him that he should ask forgiveness of that beautiful one for his infidelity when he should see her in venice.

the abbé redoubled his politeness and attentio

ns, and took a tender interest in all that candide said, in all that he did, in all that he wished to do.

"and so, sir, you have a rendezvous at venice?"

"yes, monsieur abbé," answered candide.[pg 117] "it is absolutely necessary that i go to meet miss cunegonde."

and then the pleasure of talking of that which he loved induced him to relate, according to his custom, part of his adventures with the fair westphalian.

"i believe," said the abbé, "that miss cunegonde has a great deal of wit, and that she writes charming letters?"

"i have never received any from her," said candide, "for being expelled from the castle on her account i had not an opportunity for writing to her. soon after that i heard she was dead; then i found her alive; then i lost her again; and last of all, i sent an express to her two thousand five hundred leagues from here, and i wait for an answer."

the abbé listened attentively, and seemed to be in a brown study. he soon took his le

this charming, this unhoped-for letter transported candide with an inexpressible joy, and the illness of his dear cunegonde overwhelmed him with grief. divided between those two passions, he took his gold and his diamonds and hurried away, with martin, to the hotel where miss cunegonde was lodged. he entered her room trembling, his heart palpitating, his voice sobbing; he wished to open the curtains of the bed, and asked for a light.

"take care what you do," said the servant-maid; "the light hurts her," and immediately she drew the curtain again.

"my dear cunegonde," said candide, weeping, "how are you? if you can

n officer, followed by the abbé and a file of soldiers.

"there," said he, "are the two suspected[pg 119] foreigners," and at the same time he ordered them to be seized and carried to prison.

"travellers are not treated thus in el dorado," said candide.

"i am more a manichean now than ever," said martin.

"but pray, sir, where are you going to carry us?" said candide.

"to a dungeon," answered the officer.

martin, having recovered himself a little, judged that the lady who acted the part of cunegonde was a cheat, that the perigordian abbé was a knave who had imposed upon the honest simplicity of candide, and that the officer was another knave whom they might easily silence.

candide, advised by martin and impatient to see the real cunegonde, rather than expose himself before a court of justice, proposed to the officer to give him three small diamonds, each worth about three thousand pistoles.

"ah, sir," said the man with the ivory baton, "had you committed all the imaginable crimes you wo

as others which have been committed in other years and other months by other poor devils who had heard nonsense spoken."

the officer then explained what the abbé meant.

"ah, the monsters!" cried candide. "what horrors among a people who dance and sing! is there no way of getting quickly out of this country where monkeys provoke tigers? i have seen no bears in my country, but men i have beheld nowhere except in el dorado. in the name of god, sir, conduct me to venice, where i am to await miss cunegonde."

"i can conduct you no further than lower normandy," said the officer.

immediately he ordered his irons to be struck off, acknowledged himself mistaken, sent away his men, set out with candide and martin for dieppe, and left them in the care of his brother.[pg 121]

there was then a small dutch ship in the harbour. the norman, who by the virtue of three more diamonds had become the most subservient of men, put candide and his attendants on board a vessel that was just ready to set sail for p

ortsmouth in england.

this was not the way to venice, but candide thought he had made his way out of hell, and reckoned that he would soon have an opportunity for resuming his journey.[pg 122]

candide and martin touched upon the coast of england, and what they saw there.

"ah, pangloss! pangloss! ah, martin! martin! ah, my dear cunegonde, what sort of a world is this?" said candide on board the dutch ship.

"something very foolish and abominable," said martin.

"you know england? are they as foolish there as in france?"

"it is another kind of folly," said martin. "you know that these two nations are at war for a few acres of snow in canada,[31] and that they spend over this beautiful war much more than canada is worth. to tell you exactly, whether there are more people fit to send to a madhouse in one country than the other, i

aw and heard, that he would not set foot on shore, and he made a bargain with the dutch skipper (were he even to rob him like the surinam captain) to conduct him without delay to venice.

the skipper was ready in two days. they[pg 124] coasted france; they passed in sight of lisbon, and candide trembled. they passed through the straits, and entered the mediterranean. at last they landed at venice.

"god be praised!" said candide, embracing martin. "it is here that i shall see again my beautiful cunegonde. i trust cacambo as myself. all is well, all will be well, all goes as well as possible."[pg 125]

of paquette and friar giroflée.

upon their arrival at venice, candide went to search for cacambo at every inn and coffee-house, and among all the ladies of pleasure, but to no purpose. he sent every day to inquire on all the ships that came in. but there was no news of cacambo.

"what!" said he to martin, "i have had time to voyage from surinam to bordeaux, to go from bordeaux to paris, fr

he fell into a deep melancholy, and neither[pg 126] went to see the opera, nor any of the other diversions of the carnival; nay, he was proof against the temptations of all the ladies.

"you are in truth very simple," said martin to

him, "if you imagine that a mongrel valet, who has five or six millions in his pocket, will go to the other end of the world to seek your mistress and bring her to you to venice. if he find her, he will keep her to himself; if he do not find her he will get another. i advise you to forget your valet cacambo and your mistress cunegonde."

martin was not consoling. candide's melancholy increased; and martin continued to prove to him that there was very little virtue or happiness upon earth, except perhaps in el dorado, where nobody could gain admittance.

while they were disputing on this important subject and waiting for cunegonde, candide saw a young theatin friar in st. mark's piazza, holding a girl on his arm. the theatin looked fresh coloured, plump, and vigorous; his eyes were sparkling, his air assured, his look lofty,

 some macaroni, with lombard partridges, and caviare, and to drink some montepulciano, lachrymæ christi, cyprus and samos wine. the girl blushed, the theatin accepted the invitation and she followed him, casting her eyes on candide with confusion and surprise, and dropping a few tears. no sooner had she set foot in candide's apartment than she cried out:

"ah! mr. candide does not know paquette again."

candide had not viewed her as yet with attention, his thoughts being entirely taken up with cunegonde; but recollecting her as she spoke.

"alas!" said he, "my poor child, it is you who reduced doctor pangloss to the beautiful condition in which i saw him?"

"alas! it was i, sir, indeed," answered paquette. "i see that you have heard all. i have been informed of the frightful disasters that befell the family of my lady baroness, and[pg 128] the fair cunegonde. i swear to you that my fate has been scarcely less sad. i was very innocent when you knew me. a grey friar, who was my confessor, easily

two thousand piastres to paquette, and one thousand to friar giroflée.

"i'll answer for it," said he, "that with this they will be happy."

"i do not believe it at all," said martin; "you will, perhaps, with these piastres only render them the more unhappy."

"let that be as it may," said candide, "but one thing consoles me. i see that we often meet with those whom we expected never to see more; so that, perhaps, as i have found my red sheep and paquette, it may well be that i shall also find cunegonde."

"i wish," said martin, "she may one day make you very happy; but i doubt it very much."

"you are very hard of belief," said candide.

"i have lived," said martin.

"you see those gondoliers," said candide, "are they not perpetually singing?"

"you do not see them," said martin, "at home with their wives and brats. the doge has his troubles, the gondoliers have theirs. it is true that, all things considered, the life of a gondolier is preferable to that of a doge; but i believe the[pg 132] d

"but is there not a pleasure," said candide,[pg 141] "in criticising everything, in pointing out faults where others see nothing but beauties?"

"that is to say," replied martin, "that there is some pleasure in having no pleasure."

"well, well," said candide, "i find that i shall be the only happy man when i am blessed with the sight of my dear cunegonde."

"it is always well to hope," said martin.

however, the days and the weeks passed. cacambo did not come, and candide was so overwhelmed with grief that he did not even reflect that paquette and friar giroflée did not return to thank him.[pg 142]

one evening that candide and martin were going to sit down to supper with some foreigners who lodged in the same inn, a man whose complexion was as black as

 soot, came behind candide, and taking him by the arm, said:

"get yourself ready to go along with us; do not fail."

upon this he turned round and saw—cacambo! nothing but the sight of cunegonde could have astonished and delighted him more. he was on the point of going mad with joy. he embraced his dear friend.

"cunegonde is here, without doubt; where is she? take me to her that i may die of joy in her company."

"cunegonde is not here," said cacambo, "she is at constantinople."

"oh, heavens! at constantinople! but were she in china i would fly thither; let us be off."

"we shall set out after supper," replied[pg 143] cacambo. "i can tell you nothing more; i am a slave, my master awaits me, i must serve him at table; speak not a word, eat, and then get ready."

candide, distracted between joy and grief, delighted at seeing his faithful agent again, astonished at finding him a slave, filled with the fresh hope of

ousand sequins.[pg 147]

"who can this private person be," said the five kings to one another, "who is able to give, and really has given, a hundred times as much as any of us?"

just as they rose from table, in came four serene highnesses, who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war, and were come to spend the carnival at venice. but candide paid no regard to these newcomers, his thoughts were entirely employed on his voyage to constantinople, in search of his beloved cunegonde.[pg 148]

candide's voyage to constantinople.

the faithful cacambo had already prevailed upon the turkish skipper, who was to conduct the sultan achmet to constantinople, to receive candide and martin on his ship. they both embarked after having made their obeisance to his miserable highness.

"you see," said candide to martin on the way, "we supped with six dethroned kings, and of those six there was one to whom i gave charity. perhaps there are many other princes yet more unfortunate.

 for my part, i have only lost a hundred sheep; and now i am flying into cunegonde's arms. my dear martin, yet once more pangloss was right: all is for the best."

"i wish it," answered martin.

"but," said candide, "it was a very strange adventure we met with at venice. it has never before been seen or heard that six dethroned kings have supped together at a public inn."

"it is not more extraordinary," said martin, "than most of the things that have happened to us. it is a very common thing for kings to be[pg 149] dethroned; and as for the honour we have had of supping in t

heir company, it is a trifle not worth our attention."

no sooner had candide got on board the vessel than he flew to his old valet and friend cacambo, and tenderly embraced him.

"well," said he, "what news of cunegonde? is she still a prodigy of beauty? does she love me still? how is she? thou hast doubtless bought her a palace at constantinople?"

"my dear master," answered cacambo, "cunegonde washes dishes on the banks of the propontis, in the service of a prince, who has very few dishes to wash; she is a slave in the family of an ancient sovereign named ragotsky,[35] to whom the grand turk allows three crowns a day in his exile. but what is worse still is, that she has lost her beauty and has become horribly ugly."

"well, handsome or ugly," replied candide, "i am a man of honour, and it is my duty to love her still. but how came she to be reduced to so abject a state with the five

 or six millions that you took to her?"

"ah!" said cacambo, "was i not to give two millions to senor don fernando d'ibaraa, y figueora, y mascarenes, y lampourdos, y souza, governor of buenos ayres, for permitting miss cunegonde to come away? and did[pg 150] not a corsair bravely rob us of all the rest? did not this corsair carry us to cape matapan, to milo, to nicaria, to samos, to petra, to the dardanelles, to marmora, to scutari? cunegonde and the old woman serve the prince i now mentioned to you, and i am slave to the dethroned sultan."

"what a series of shocking calamities!" cried candide. "but after all, i have some diamonds left; and i may easily pay cunegonde's ransom. yet it is a pity that she is grown so ugly."

then, turning towards martin: "who do you think," said he, "is most to be pitied—the sultan achmet, the emperor ivan, king charles edward, or i?"

"how should i know!" answered martin. "i must see into your hear

a just estimate on their sorrows. all that i can presume to say is, that there are millions of people upon earth who have a hundred times more to complain of than king charles edward, the emperor ivan, or the sultan achmet."

"that may well be," said candide.

in a few days they reached the bosphorus,[pg 151] and candide began by paying a very high ransom for cacambo. then without losing time, he and his companions went on board a galley, in order to search on the banks of the propontis for his cunegonde, however ugly she might have become.

among the crew there were two slaves who rowed very badly, and to whose bare shoulders the levantine captain would now and then apply blows from a bull's pizzle. candide, from a natural impulse, looked at these two slaves more attentively than at the other oarsmen, and approached them with pity. their features though greatly disfigured, had a slight resemblance to those of pangloss and the unhappy jesuit and westphalian baron, brother to miss cunegonde. thi

"dog of a christian," answered the levantine captain, "since these two dogs of christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians, which i doubt not are high dignities in their country, you shall give me fifty thousand sequins."

"you shall have them, sir. carry me back at once to constantinople, and you shall receive the money directly. but no; carry me first to miss cunegonde."

upon the first proposal made by candide, however, the levantine captain had already tacked about, and made the crew ply their oars quicker than a bird cleaves the air.

candide embraced the baron and pangloss a hundred times.

"and how happened it, my dear baron, that[pg 153] i did not kill you? and, my dear pangloss, how came you to life again after being hanged? and why are you both in a turkish galley?"

"and it is true that my dear sister is in this country?" said the baron.

atter threw himself at the feet of his deliverer, and bathed them with his tears; the former thanked him with a nod, and promised to return him the money on the first opportunity.

"but is it indeed possible that my sister can be in turkey?" said he.

"nothing is more possible," said cacambo, "since she scours the dishes in the service of a transylvanian prince."

candide sent directly for two jews and sold them some more diamonds, and then they all set out together in another galley to deliver cunegonde from slavery.[pg 154]

"well, my dear pangloss," said candide to him, "when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?"

"i am still of my first opinion," answered pangloss, "for i am a philosopher and i cannot[pg 158] retract, especially as leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis."[pg 159]

how candide found cunegonde and the old woman again.

while candide, the baron, pangloss, martin, and cacambo were relating their several adventures, were reasoning on the contingent or non-contingent events of the universe, disputing on effects and causes, on moral and physical evil, on liberty and necessity, and on the consolations a slave may feel even on a turkish galley, they arrived at the house of the transylvanian prince on the banks of the propontis. the first objects which met their sight were cunegonde and the

the baron paled at this sight. the tender, loving candide, seeing his beautiful cunegonde embrowned, with blood-shot eyes, withered neck, wrinkled cheeks, and rough, red arms, recoiled three paces, seized with horror, and then advanced out of good manners. she embraced candide and her brother; they embraced the old woman, and candide ransomed them both.

there was a small farm in the neighbourhood[pg 160] which the old woman proposed to candide to make a shift with till the company could be provided for in a better manner. cunegonde did not know she had grown ugly, for nobody had to

ld her of it; and she reminded candide of his promise in so positive a tone that the good man durst not refuse her. he therefore intimated to the baron that he intended marrying his sister.

"i will not suffer," said the baron, "such meanness on her part, and such insolence on yours; i will never be reproached with this scandalous thing; my sister's children would never be able to enter the church in germany. no; my sister shall only marry a baron of the empire."

cunegonde flung herself at his feet, and bathed them with her tears; still he was inflexible.

"thou foolish fellow," said candide; "i have delivered thee out of the galleys, i have paid thy ransom, and thy sister's also; she was a scullion, and is very ugly, yet i am so condescending as to marry her; and dost thou pretend to oppose the match? i should kill thee again, were i only to consult my anger."

"thou mayest kill me again," said the baron, "but thou shalt not marry my sister, at least whilst i am

the conclusion.

at the bottom of his heart candide had no wish to marry cunegonde. but the extreme impertinence of the baron determined him to conclude the match, and cunegonde pressed him so strongly that he could not go from his word. he consulted pangloss, martin, and the faithful cacambo. pangloss drew up an excellent memorial, wherein he proved that the baron had no right over his sister, and that according to all the laws of the empire, she might marry candide with her left hand. martin was for throwing the baron into the sea; cacambo decided that it would be better to deliver him up again to the captain of the galley, after which they thought to send him back t

it is natural to imagine that after so many disasters candide married, and living with the philosopher pangloss, the philosopher martin, the prudent cacambo, and the old woman, having besides brought so many diamonds from the country of the ancient incas, must have led a very happy life. but he was so much imposed upon by the jews that he had nothing left except his small farm; his wife became uglier every day, more peevish and unsupportable; the old woman was infirm and even more fretful than cunegonde. cacambo, who worked in the garden, and took vegetables for sale to constantinople, was fatigued with hard work, and cursed his destiny. pangloss was in despair at not shining in some german university. for martin, he was firmly persuaded that he would be as badly off elsewhere, and therefore bore things patiently. candide, martin, and pangloss sometimes disputed about morals and metaphysics. they often saw passing under the windows of their farm boats full of effendis, pashas, and cadis, who w

," said candide, "that we must cultivate our garden."

"you are right," said pangloss, "for when man was first placed in the garden of eden, he was put there ut operaretur eum, that he might cultivate it; which shows that man was not born to be idle."

"let us work," said martin, "without disputing; it is the only way to render life tolerable."

the whole little society entered into this laudable design, according to their different abilities. their little plot of land produced plentiful crops. cunegonde was, indeed, very ugly, but she became an excellent pastry cook; paquette worked at embroidery; the old woman looked after the[pg 168] linen. they were all, not excepting friar giroflée, of some service or other; for he made a good joiner, and became a very honest man.

pangloss sometimes said to candide:

"there is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds: for if you had not been kicked out of a magnificent castle for love of miss cunegonde: if you had not been put into t
