Pearl and Margie  - 
      Rocky's two "tarts" are feather-brained, sentimental, lazy, and reasonably content with life. Though they retain a degree of youthful prettiness, their trade is beginning to wear on them. Their pipe dream involves the denial of their status as whores. They relate to their pipe as two affectionate sisters might with a bullying brother.
