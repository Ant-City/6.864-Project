en to it. the gods must be proud, thought i, with such
forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. so i made haste for
shelter to the nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road, but
so much the nearer to the pond, and had long been uninhabited:--

                 "and here a poet builded,
                     in the completed years,
                  for behold a trivial cabin
                     that to destruction steers."

so the muse fables. but therein, as i found, dwelt now john field, an
irishman, and his wife, and several children, from the broad-faced boy
who assisted his father at his work, and now came running by his
side from the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like,
cone-headed infant that sat upon its father's knee as in the palaces
of nobles, and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger
inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not
knowing but it was the last of a noble line, and the hope and cynosure
of the world,

 instead of john field's poor starveling brat. there we sat
together under that part of the roof which leaked the least, while it
showered and thundered without. i had sat there many times of old
before the ship was built that floated his family to america. an honest,
hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was john field; and his wife,
she too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in the recesses of
that lofty stove; with round greasy face and bare breast, still thinking
to improve her condition one day; with the never absent mop in one hand,
and yet no effects of it visible anywhere. the chickens, which had also
taken shelter here from the rain, stalked about the room like members
of the family, too humanized, methought, to roast well. they stood and
looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe significantly.

begin such a course with, or arithmetic enough to carry it through. it
was sailing by dead reckoning to them, and they saw not clearly how to
make their port so; therefore i suppose they still take life bravely,
after their fashion, face to face, giving it tooth and nail, not having
skill to split its massive columns with any fine entering wedge, and
rout it in detail;--thinking to deal with it roughly, as one
should handle a thistle. but they fight at an overwhelming
disadvantage--living, john field, alas! without arithmetic, and failing
so.

"do you ever fish?" i asked. "oh yes, i catch a mess now and then when
i am lying by; good perch i catch."--"what's your bait?" "i catch shiners
with fishworms, and bait the perch with them." "you'd better go now,
john," said his wife, with glistening and hopeful face; but john
demurred.

the shower was now over, and a rainbow above the eastern woods promised
a fair evening; so i took my departure. when i had got without i asked
for a drink, hoping to

s, morning and evening, reach
farther than their daily steps. we should come home from far, from
adventures, and perils, and discoveries every day, with new experience
and character.

before i had reached the pond some fresh impulse had brought out john
field, with altered mind, letting go "bogging" ere this sunset. but he,
poor man, disturbed only a couple of fins while i was catching a fair
string, and he said it was his luck; but when we changed seats in the
boat luck changed seats too. poor john field!--i trust he does not read
this, unless he will improve by it--thinking to live by some derivative
old-country mode in this primitive new country--to catch perch with
shiners. it is good bait sometimes, i allow. with his horizon all
his own, yet he a poor man, born to be poor, with his inherited irish
poverty or poor life, his adam's grandmother and boggy ways, not to
rise in this world, he nor his posterity, till their wading webbed
bog-trotting feet get _talaria_ to their heels.
