won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!’ when the
mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
face was quite pale (with passion, alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, ‘let us get to the shore, and then i’ll tell you my
history, and you’ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs.’

it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a duck and a dodo,
a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious creatures. alice led the
way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




chapter iii. a caucus-race and a long tale

they were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

the first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite

he question is, what did the
archbishop find?’

the mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, ‘“--found
it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the
crown. william’s conduct at first was moderate. but the insolence of his
normans--” how are you getting on now, my dear?’ it continued, turning
to alice as it spoke.

‘as wet as ever,’ said alice in a melancholy tone: ‘it doesn’t seem to
dry me at all.’

‘in that case,’ said the dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, ‘i move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies--’

‘speak english!’ said the eaglet. ‘i don’t know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what’s more, i don’t believe you do either!’ and
the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

‘what i was going to say,’ said the dodo in an offended tone, ‘was, that
the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus-rac

e.’

‘what is a caucus-race?’ said alice; not that she wanted much to know,
but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak,
and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

‘why,’ said the dodo, ‘the best way to explain it is to do it.’ (and, as
you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, i will tell
you how the dodo managed it.)

first it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, [‘the exact
shape doesn’t matter,’ it said,) and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. there was no ‘one, two, three, and
away,’ but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. however,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,
the dodo suddenly called out ‘the race is over!’ an

d they all crowded
round it, panting, and asking, ‘but who has won?’

this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,
and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead
(the position in which you usually see shakespeare, in the pictures
of him), while the rest waited in silence. at last the dodo said,
‘everybody has won, and all must have prizes.’

‘but who is to give the prizes?’ quite a chorus of voices asked.

‘why, she, of course,’ said the dodo, pointing to alice with one finger;
and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
way, ‘prizes! prizes!’

alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. ther

a-piece all round.

‘but she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said the mouse.

‘of course,’ the dodo replied very gravely. ‘what else have you got in
your pocket?’ he went on, turning to alice.

‘only a thimble,’ said alice sadly.

‘hand it over here,’ said the dodo.

then they all crowded round her once more, while the dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying ‘we beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble’; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.

alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
could.

the next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they
