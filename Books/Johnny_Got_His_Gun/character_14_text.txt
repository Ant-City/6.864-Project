y was the first and only girl they knew they
were too shy with other girls with nice girls. they soon grew ashamed of ruby and when
they went down they would always feel a little dirty and a little disgusted. they came
away blaming ruby somehow for making them feel that way. by the time they got to the
tenth grade none of them would ever speak to ruby and finally she disappeared. she just
wasn't around any more and they were all kind of glad they didn't have to meet her on the
street.
there was laurette down at stumpy telsa's place. stumpy telsa had a house in shale
city. she had five or six girls there and the finest pair of boston bulls in town. the guys
when they were young when they were maybe fourteen or fifteen used to wonder a great
deal about stumpy telsa's place. for them it was the most wonderful the most exciting
the most mysterious house in shale city. they would hear stories from older guys on
what went on down there. they could never quite decide whether they were for it or
again

ciding they were either lies or else they were the
kind of guys that women didn't like in that way. that was bad maybe they'd be failures
with women all their lives maybe there was something they didn't have. they decided not
to tell anybody about their visit because they felt they were much more disgraced than if
things had turned out differently.
later on he got to thinking about the girl who talked books and after thinking about
it for a long while he went down to see her again. her name was laurette and she seemed
glad to see him. she told him if he wanted to see her always to be sure he made it before
nine o'clock because after that time things were generally pretty busy. he did come again
and several times more and always they sat in the parlor and always they talked. he got
to thinking maybe i'm in love with laurette now wouldn't that be a fine thing me falling
in love with her and how would i break the news to my mother and father? and on the
other hand he would think why is it that al

during the winter of that year and on through the spring he went down to see laurette
once maybe twice sometimes even three times a month. and each time he went down just
before he knocked on the door he would pull himself together and he would say to
himself joe bonham be a man this time. but laurette was so nice he couldn't figure out
how a fellow started things like that without seeming kind of dirty. so he never did.
when he graduated from high school he got a pair of gold cuff links through the mail
and all they had with them was a card that had the initial l written on it. he had a hell of
a time explaining to his folks who sent him the links but he prized them very highly and
he decided that tomorrow night after graduation he would go down to stumpy telsa's.
now that laurette had told

him in a kind of roundabout way that she loved him things
would be different. so about nine o'clock on the big night he went down to stumpy
telsa's still hunting for some pleasant and polite way to express the thing that was in his
mind. he knocked on the door and stumpy telsa invited him in and when he asked for
laurette she told him laurette wasn't there. where had she gone? she had gone to estes
park. every year said stumpy telsa she takes three months off up there. all winter long
she buys new clothes and she saves her money and for three months she lives at the best
hotel in estes park. she goes out with guys and she dances and she dearly loves to have
the guys fall in love with her and when they fall for her she is always nice to them but she
is never too nice. she is never as nice as they want her to be. she is a smart girl th

laureite said stumpy telsa she eats her cake and she has it too. and on top of that she
saves her money and she has a nice little bankroll. why don't you get a job in some other
town and then come around in the fall after laurette is rested up and talk things over with
her? maybe you and laurette would be very happy. but by the time fall came he was
working in a bakery fifteen hundred miles away and he never saw laurette again.
there was a girl named bonnie. she clapped him on the back one day while he was
sitting in louie's drug store near the bakery having a coke. she slapped him on the back
and she said to him you're joe bonham ain't you joe bon-ham from shale city? well i'm
bonnie flannigan we used to go to school together jesus it's good to see somebody from
god's country. he looked at her and he couldn't remember her at all. oh yes he said i
remember you. she nodded and said you were ahead of me in school
