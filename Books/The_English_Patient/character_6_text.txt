in 1936 a young man named geoffrey clifton had met a friend at oxford who mentioned what we were doing. he contacted 

me, got married the next day, and two weeks later flew with his wife to cairo. 

the couple entered our world‚Äîthe four of us, prince kemal el din, bell, almasy and madox. the name that still filled our 
mouths  was  gilf  kebir.  somewhere  in  the  gilf  nestled  zerzura,  whose  name  occurs  in  arab  writings  as  far  back  as  the 
thirteenth century. when you travel that far in time you need a plane, and young clifton was rich and he could fly and he had a 
plane. 

clifton met us in el jof, north of uweinat. he sat in his two-seater plane and we walked towards him from the base camp.

carrying spice, rooms, government advisors wherever they went. at any given moment among the bedouin in those days of the

leaving the truck, i started walking towards uweinat, where i knew there was a buried plane.

the desert, i took with me the evenings of dancing to the 78 of ‚Äúsouvenirs‚Äù in the bars, the women pacing like greyhounds, 
leaning against you while you muttered into their shoulders during ‚Äúmy sweet.‚Äù courtesy of the societe ultraphone franchise 
record company. 1938. 1939. there was the whispering of love in a booth. there was war around the corner. 

during those final nights in cairo, months after the affair was over, we had finally persuaded madox into a zinc bar for his 
farewell. she and her husband were there. one last night. one last dance. almasy was drunk and attempting an old dance step 
he had invented called the bosphorus hug, lifting katharine clifton into his wiry arms and traversing the floor until he fell with 
her across some nile-grown aspidistras. 

 
who is he speaking as now? caravaggio thinks. 
 
almasy was drunk and his dancing seemed to the others a brutal series of movements. in those days he and she did not seem

o be getting on well. he swung her from side to side as if she were some anonymous doll, and smothered with drink his grief 
at madox‚Äôs leaving. he was loud at the tables with us. when almasy was like this we usually dispersed, but this was madox‚Äôs 
last night in cairo and we stayed. a bad egyptian violinist mimicking stephane grappelly, and almasy like a planet out of 
control. ‚Äúto us‚Äîthe planetary strangers,‚Äù he lifted his glass. he wanted to dance with everyone, men and women. he clapped 
his hands and announced, ‚Äúnow for the bosphorus hug. you, bernhardt? hetherton?‚Äù most pulled back. he turned to clifton‚Äôs 
young wife, who was watching him in a courteous rage, and she went forward as he beckoned and then slammed into

staring hard at him when he pulled his head back, not solemn but with an attacking face. his mouth muttering at her when he

in  cairo  between  expeditions  no  one  ever  saw  much  of  almasy.  he  seemed  either  distant  or  restless.  he  worked  in  the 
museum during the day and frequented the south cairo market bars at night. lost in another egypt. it was only for madox they 
had all come here. but now almasy was dancing with katharine clifton. the line of plants brushed against her slimness. he 
pivoted with her, lifting her up, and then fell. clifton stayed in his seat, half watching them. almasy lying across her and then 
slowly trying to get up, smoothing back his blond hair, kneeling over her in the far corner of the room. he had at one time been 
a man of delicacy. 

it  was  past  midnight.  the  guests  there  were  not  amused,  except  for  the  easi

dometer mileage and the book, he was alone, his own invention. he 
knew during these times how the mirage worked, the fata morgana, for he was within it. 

 
he awakens to discover hana washing him. there is a bureau at waist level. she leans over, her hands bringing water from 
the porcelain basin to his chest. when she finishes she runs her wet fingers through her hair a few times, so it turns damp and 
dark. she looks up and sees his eyes are open, and smiles. 

when he opens his eyes again, madox is there, looking ragged, weary, carrying the morphinic injection, having to use both 
hands because there are no thumbs. how does he give it to himself? he thinks. he recognizes the eye, the habit of the tongue 
fluttering at the lip, the clearness of the man‚Äôs brain catching all he says. two old coots. 

caravaggio watches the pink in the man‚Äôs mouth as he talks. the gums perhaps the light iodine colour of the rock paintings 
discovered in uweinat. there is more to discover, to divine out

at the clarity of discipline in the man, who speaks sometimes in the first person, 
sometimes in the third person, who still does not admit that he is almasy. 

‚Äúwho was talking, back then?‚Äù 
‚Äú ‚Äòdeath means you are in the third person. 
 
all day they have shared the ampoules of morphine. to unthread the story out of him, caravaggio travels within the code of 
signals. when the burned man slows down, or when caravaggio feels he is not catching everything‚Äîthe love affair, the death 
of madox‚Äîhe picks up the syringe from the kidney-shaped enamel tin, breaks the glass tip off an ampoule with the pressure of 
a knuckle and loads it. he is blunt about all this now with hana, having ripped the sleeve off his left arm completely. almasy 
wears just a grey singlet, so his black arm lies bare under the sheet. 

each swallow of morphine by the body opens a further door, or he leaps back to the cave paintings or to a buried plane or 

lingers once more with the woman beside him under a fan

a camel. two and a half miles an hour. if lucky, he would come upon ostrich eggs. if unlucky, a 
sandstorm would erase everything. he walked for three days without any food. he refused to think about her. if he got to el 
taj he would eat abra, which the goran tribes made out of colocynth, boiling the pips to get rid of bitterness and then crushing 
it  along  with  dates  and  locusts.  he  would  walk  through  the  street  of  clocks  and  alabaster.  may  god  make  safety  your 
companion, madox had said. good-bye. a wave. there is god only in the desert, he wanted to acknowledge that now. outside 
of this there was just trade and power, money and war. financial and military despots shaped the world. 

he was in broken country, had moved from sand to rock. he refused to think about her. then hills emerged like mediaeval 
castles. he walked till he stepped with his shadow into the shadow of a mountain. mimosa shrubs. colocynths. he yelled out 
her name into the rocks. for echo is the so

private man. it is difficult to realize i was so discussed.‚Äù 
‚Äúyou were having an affair with someone connected with intelligence. there were some people in intelligence who knew 

you personally.‚Äù 

‚Äúbagnold probably.‚Äù 
‚Äúyes.‚Äù 
‚Äúvery english englishman.‚Äù 
‚Äúyes.‚Äù 
caravaggio paused. 
‚Äúi have to talk to you about one last thing.‚Äù 
‚Äúi know.‚Äù 
‚Äúwhat happened to katharine clifton? what happened just before the war to make you all come to the gilf kebir again? 

after madox left for england.‚Äù 

 
i was supposed to make one more journey to the gilf kebir, to pack up the last of the base camp at uweinat. our life there 
was  over.  i  thought  nothing  more  would  happen  between  us.  i  had  not  met  her  as  a  lover  for  almost  a  year.  a  war  was 
preparing itself somewhere like a hand entering an attic window. and she and i had already retreated behind our own walls of 
previous habit, into seeming innocence of relationship. we no longer saw each other

ight ahead. sand had come in through the cockpit window 
and had filled her lap. there didn‚Äôt seem to be a mark on her. her left hand had gone forward to cushion the collapse of their 
flight.  i  pulled  her  out  of  the  plane  clifton  had  called  rupert  and  carried  her  up  into  the  rock  caves.  into  the  cave  of 
swimmers, where the paintings were. latitude 23¬∞3o‚Äô on the map, longitude 25¬∞!5‚Äô. i buried geoffrey clifton that night. 

 
was i a curse upon them? for her? for madox? for the desert raped by war, shelled as if it were just sand? the barbarians 
versus the barbarians. both armies would come through the desert with no sense of what it was. the deserts of libya. remove 
politics, and it is the loveliest phrase i know. libya. a sexual, drawn-out word, a coaxed well. the b and the y. madox said it 
was one of the few words in which you heard the tongue turn a corner. remember dido in the deserts of libya? a man shall 
be as rivers of water in a dry place....

 do not believe i entered a cursed land, or that i was ensnared in a situation that was evil. every place and person was a gift 
to me. finding the rock paintings in the cave of swimmers. singing ‚Äúburdens‚Äù with madox during expeditions. katharine‚Äôs 
appearance among us in the desert. the way i would walk towards her over the red polished concrete floor and sink to my 
knees, her belly against  my  head as if i  were a boy. the gun  tribe healing  me. even the four of  us, hana and  you and the 
sapper. 

everything i have loved or valued has been taken away from me. 
i stayed with her. i discovered three of her ribs were broken. i kept waiting for her wavering eye, for her broken wrist to 

bend, for her

ight in the cave. her neck flipping this way and that. 

 
i know the devices of a demon. i was taught as a child about the demon lover. i was told about a beautiful temptress who 
came to a young man‚Äôs room. and he, if he were wise, would demand that she turn around, because demons and witches have 
no back, only what they wish to present to you. what had i done? what animal had i delivered into her? i had been speaking to 
her i think for over an hour. had i been her demon lover? had i been madox‚Äôs demon friend? this country‚Äîhad i charted it 
and turned it into a place of war? 

it is important to die in holy places. that was one of the secrets of the desert. so madox walked into a church in somerset, a 

place he felt had lost its holiness, and he committed what he believed was a holy act. 

when i turned her around, her whole body was covered in bright pigment. herbs and stones and light and the ash of acacia 
to  make  her  eternal.  the  body  pressed  against  sacred  colour.
