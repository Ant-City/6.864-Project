the iceman cometh



act one



scene--the back room and a section of the bar of harry hope's saloon on an early morning in summer, 1912. the right wall of the back room is a dirty black curtain which separates it from the bar. at rear, this curtain is drawn back from the wall so the bartender can get in and out. the back room is crammed with round tables and chairs placed so close together that it is a difficult squeeze to pass between them. in the middle of the rear wall is a door opening on a hallway. in the left corner, built out into the room, is the toilet with a sign "this is i

er army officer. he is going on sixty. his hair and military mustache are white, his eyes bright blue, his complexion that of a turkey. his lean figure is still erect and square-shouldered. he is stripped to the waist, his coat, shirt, undershirt, collar and tie crushed up into a pillow on the table in front of him, his head sideways on this pillow, facing front, his arms dangling toward the floor. on his lower left shoulder is the big ragged scar of an old wound.

at the table at right, front, harry hope, the proprietor, sits in the middle, facing front, with pat mcgloin on his right and ed mosher on his left, the other two chairs being unoccupied.

both mcgloin and mosher are big paunchy men. mcgloin has his old occupation of policeman stamped all over him. he is in his fifties, sandy-haired, bullet-headed, jowly, with protruding ears and little round eyes. his face must once have been brutal and greedy, but time and whiskey have melted it down into a good-humored, parasite's characterlessness
 
 ___________________________
 
village fat boy--a sly fat boy, congenitally indolent, a practical joker, a born grafter and con merchant. but amusing and essentially harmless, even in his most enterprising days, because always too lazy to carry crookedness beyond petty swindling. the influence of his old circus career is apparent in his get-up. his worn clothes are flashy; he wears phony rings and a heavy brass watch-chain (not connected to a watch). like mcgloin, he is slovenly. his head is thrown back, his big mouth open.

harry hope is sixty, white-haired, so thin the description "bag of bones" was made for him. he has the face of an old family horse, prone to tantrums, with balkiness always smoldering in its wall eyes, waiting for any excuse to shy and pretend to take the bit in its teeth. hope is one of those men whom everyone likes on sight, a softhearted slob, without malice, feeling superior to no one, a sinner among sinners, a born easy mark for every appeal. he attempts to hide his defenselessness behind a testy tru

ard, am i? oh, i heard you! heard you often when you didn't think. you and chuck laughing behind my back, telling people you throw the money up in the air and whatever sticks to the ceiling is my share! a fine couple of crooks! you'd steal the pennies off your dead mother's eyes!

rocky--(winks at larry) aw, harry, me and chuck was on'y kiddin'.

hope--(more drowsily) i'll fire both of you. bejees, if you think you can play me for an easy mark, you've come to the wrong house. no one ever played harry hope for a sucker!

rocky--(to larry) no one but everybody.

hope--(his eyes shut again--mutters) least you could do--keep things quiet--(he falls asleep.)

willie--(pleadingly) give me a drink, rocky. harry said it was all right. god, i need a drink.

rocky--den grab it. it's right under your nose.

willie--(avidly) thanks. (he takes the bottle with both twitching hands and tilts it to his lips and gulps down the whiskey in big swallows.)

rocky--(sharply) when! when! (he grabs the bottle.) i didn'

ight, he comes forward and sits at the table and slumps back, closing his eyes and yawning.)

joe--(stares calculatingly at parritt and then looks away--aloud to himself, philosophically) one-drink guy. dat well done run dry. no hope till harry's birthday party. 'less hickey shows up. (he turns to larry.) if hickey comes, larry, you wake me up if you has to bat me wid a chair. (he settles himself and immediately falls asleep.)

parritt--who's hickey?

larry--a hardware drummer. an old friend of harry hope's and all the gang. he's a grand guy. he comes here twice a year regularly on a periodical drunk and blows in all his money.

parritt--(with a disparaging glance around) must be hard up for a place to hang out.

larry--it has its points for him. he never runs into anyone he knows in his business here.

parritt--(lowering his voice) yes, that's what i want, too. i've got to stay under cover, larry, like i told you last night.

larry--you did a lot of hinting. you didn't tell me anything.

ried to murder each other. the little guy between them was in it, too, as correspondent for some english paper. his nickname here is jimmy tomorrow. he's the leader of our tomorrow movement.

parritt--what do they do for a living?

larry--as little as possible. once in a while one of them makes a successful touch somewhere, and some of them get a few dollars a month from connections at home who pay it on condition they never come back. for the rest, they live on free lunch and their old friend, harry hope, who doesn't give a damn what anyone does or doesn't do, as long as he likes you.

parritt--it must be a tough life.

larry--it's not. don't waste your pity. they wouldn't thank you for it. they manage to get drunk, by hook or crook, and keep their pipe dreams, and that's all they ask of life. i've never known more contented men. it isn't often that men attain the true goal of their heart's desire. the same applies to harry himself and his two cronies at the far table. he's so satisfied with li

ows in de white gamblin' houses. "you're all right, joe, you're white," dey says. (he chuckles.) wouldn't let me play craps, dough. dey know i could make dem dice behave. "any odder game and any limit you like, joe," dey says. man, de money i lost! (he chuckles--then with an underlying defensiveness) look at de big chief in dem days. he knew i was white. i'd saved my dough so i could start my own gamblin' house. folks in de know tells me, see de man at de top, den you never has trouble. you git harry hope give you a letter to de chief. and harry does. don't you, harry?

hope--(preoccupied with his own thoughts) eh? sure. big bill was a good friend of mine. i had plenty of friends high up in those days. still could have if i wanted to go out and see them. sure, i gave you a letter. i said you was white. what the hell of it?

 eyes closed again in sleep or a drowse.)

larry--(aloud to himself--in his comically tense, crazy whisper) be god, this bughouse will drive me stark, raving loony yet!

hope--(turns on him with fuming suspicion) what? what d'you say?

larry--(placatingly) nothing, harry. i had a crazy thought in my head.

hope--(irascibly) crazy is right! yah! the old wise guy! wise, hell! a damned old fool anarchist i-won't-worker! i'm sick of you and hugo, too. bejees, you'll pay up tomorrow, or i'll start a harry hope revolution! i'll tie a dispossess bomb to your tails that'll blow you out in the street! bejees, i'll make your movement move! (the witticism delights him and he bursts into a shrill cackle. at once mcgloin and mosher guffaw enthusiastically.)

mosher--(flatteringly) harry, you sure say the funniest things! (he reaches on the table as if he expected a glass to be there--then starts with well-acted surprise.) hell, where's my drink? that rocky is too damned fast cleaning tables. why, i'd only ta

ood-naturedly) sure, kid all you like, willie. i'm hardened to it. (he pauses--seriously) but i'm telling you some day before long i'm going to make them reopen my case. everyone knows there was no real evidence against me, and i took the fall for the ones higher up. i'll be found innocent this time and reinstated. (wistfully) i'd like to have my old job on the force back. the boys tell me there's fine pickings these days, and i'm not getting rich here, sitting with a parched throat waiting for harry hope to buy a drink. (he glances reproachfully at hope.)

willie--of course, you'll be reinstated, mac. all you need is a brilliant young attorney to handle your case. i'll be straightened out and on the wagon in a day or two. i've never practiced but i was one of the most brilliant students in law school, and your case is just the opportunity i need to start. (darkly) don't worry about my not forcing the d.a. to reopen your case. i went through my father's papers before the cops destroyed them, and

ed, boss? hickey'd never turn up dis time of de mornin'!

hope--(starts and listens) someone's coming now.

rocky--(listens) aw, dat's on'y my two pigs. it's about time dey showed. (he goes back toward the door at left of the bar.)

hope--(sourly disappointed) you keep them dumb broads quiet. i don't want to go to bed. i'm going to catch a couple more winks here and i don't want no damn-fool laughing and screeching. (he settles himself in his chair, grumbling) never thought i'd see the day when harry hope's would have tarts rooming in it. what'd bessie think? but i don't let 'em use my rooms for business. and they're good kids. good as anyone else. they got to make a living. pay their rent, too, which is more than i can say for--(he cocks an eye over his specs at mosher and grins with satisfaction.) bejees, ed, i'll bet bessie is doing somersaults in her grave! (he chuckles. but mosher's eyes are closed, his head nodding, and he doesn't reply, so hope closes his eyes. rocky has opened the barroo

 chuckles.) harry don't even want to remember it's his birthday now! (he hears a noise from the stairs.) here they come! (urgently) light the candles! get ready to play, cora! stand up, everybody! get that wine ready, chuck and rocky! (margie and pearl light the candles on the cake. cora gets her hands set over the piano keys, watching over her shoulder. rocky and chuck go in the bar. everybody at the table stands up mechanically. hugo is the last, suddenly coming to and scrambling to his feet. harry hope and jimmy tomorrow appear in the hall outside the door. hickey looks up from his watch.) on the dot! it's twelve! (like a cheer leader) come on now, everybody, with a happy birthday, harry! (with his voice leading they all shout "happy birthday, harry!" in a spiritless chorus. hickey signals to cora, who starts playing and singing in a whiskey soprano "she's the sunshine of paradise alley." hope and jimmy stand in the doorway. both have been drinking heavily. in hope the effect is apparent only

hickey--(amusedly) always a high-toned swell at heart, eh, hugo? god help us poor bums if you'd ever get to telling us where to get off! you'd have been drinking our blood beneath those willow trees! (he chuckles. hugo shrinks back in his chair, blinking at him, but hickey is now looking up the table at hope. he starts his toast, and as he goes on he becomes more moved and obviously sincere.) here's the toast, ladies and gents! here's to harry hope, who's been a friend in need to every one of us! here's to the old governor, the best sport and the kindest, biggest-hearted guy in the world! here's wishing you all the luck there is, harry, and long life and happiness! come on, everybody! to harry! bottoms up! (they have all caught his sincerity with eager relief. they raise their schooners with an enthusiastic chorus of "here's how, harry!" "here's luck, harry!" etc., and gulp half the wine down, hickey leading them in this.)

act three



scene--barroom of harry hope's, including a part of what had been the back room in acts one and two. in the right wall are two big windows, with the swinging doors to the street between them. the bar itself is at rear. behind it is a mirror, covered with white mosquito netting to keep off the flies, and a shelf on which are barrels of cheap whiskey with spiggots and a small show case of bottled goods. at left of the bar is the doorway to the hall. there is a table at left, front, of barroom proper, with four chairs. at rig

chuck--(angrily) aw, baby, what d'we care for dat pimp? (rocky turns on him threateningly, but chuck hears someone upstairs in the hall and grabs cora's arm.) here's hickey comin'! let's get outa here! (they hurry into the hall. the street door is heard slamming behind them.)

rocky--(gloomily pronounces an obituary) one regular guy and one all-right tart gone to hell! (fiercely) dat louse hickey oughta be croaked! (there is a muttered growl of assent from most of the gathering. then harry hope enters from the hall, followed by jimmy tomorrow, with hickey on his heels. hope and jimmy are both putting up a front of self-assurance, but cora's description of them was apt. there is a desperate bluff in their manner as they walk in, which suggests the last march of the condemned. hope is dressed in an old black sunday suit, black tie, shoes, socks, which give him the appearance of being in mourning. jimmy's clothes are pressed, his shoes shined, his white linen immaculate. he has a hangove
