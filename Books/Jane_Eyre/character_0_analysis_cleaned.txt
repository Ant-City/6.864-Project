[CHARACTER]
the development of [CHARACTER]'s character is central to
the novel. from the beginning, jane possesses a sense of her self-worth
and dignity, a commitment to justice and principle, a trust in god,
and a passionate disposition. her integrity is continually tested
over the course of the novel, and jane must learn to balance the
frequently conflicting aspects of herself so as to find contentment.

an orphan since early childhood, jane feels exiled and
ostracized at the beginning of the novel, and the cruel treatment
she receives from her aunt reed and her cousins only exacerbates
her feeling of alienation. afraid that she will never find a true
sense of home or community, jane feels the need to belong somewhere,
to find "kin," or at least "kindred spirits." this desire tempers
her equally intense need for autonomy and freedom.
in her search for freedom, jane also struggles with the
question of what type of freedom she wants. while rochester initially
offers jane a chance to liberate her passions, jane comes to realize
that such freedom could also mean enslavement--by living as rochester's
mistress, she would be sacrificing her dignity and integrity for the
sake of her feelings. st. john rivers offers jane another kind of freedom:
the freedom to act unreservedly on her principles. he opens to jane
the possibility of exercising her talents fully by working and living
with him in india. jane eventually realizes, though, that this freedom
would also constitute a form of imprisonment, because she would
be forced to keep her true feelings and her true passions always
in check.
charlotte bronte may have created the character of jane
eyre as a means of coming to terms with elements of her own life.
much evidence suggests that bronte, too, struggled to find a balance
between love and freedom and to find others who understood her.
at many points in the book, jane voices the author's then-radical
opinions on religion, social class, and gender.
