book one--the romantic egotist



chapter 1. amory, son of beatrice


amory blaine inherited from his mother every trait, except the
stray inexpressible few, that made him worth while. his father, an
ineffectual, inarticulate man with a taste for byron and a habit of
drowsing over the encyclopedia britannica, grew wealthy at thirty
through the death of two elder brothers, successful chicago brokers, and
in the first flush of feeling that the world was his, went to bar harbor
and met beatrice oâ€™hara. in consequence, stephen blaine handed down to
posterity his height of just

noon he brought it to light
with a sigh, and after some consideration and a preliminary draft in the
back of collar and danielâ€™s â€œfirst-year latin,â€ composed an answer:

  my dear miss st. claire:
  your truly charming envitation for the evening of next thursday
  evening was truly delightful to receive this morning.  i will be
  charm and inchanted indeed to present my compliments on next
  thursday evening.
                          faithfully,

                                          amory blaine.

          *****

on thursday, therefore, he walked pensively along the slippery,
shovel-scraped sidewalks, and came in sight of myraâ€™s house, on the
half-hour after five, a lateness which he fancied his mother would
have favored. he waited on the door-step with his eyes nonchalantly
half-closed, and planned his entrance with precision. he would cross
the floor, not too hastily, to mrs. st. claire, and say with exactly the
correct modulation:

st be quite formal. he approved of that--as he
approved of the butler.

â€œmiss myra,â€ he said.

to his surprise the butler grinned horribly.

â€œoh, yeah,â€ he declared, â€œsheâ€™s here.â€ he was unaware that his failure
to be cockney was ruining his standing. amory considered him coldly.

â€œbut,â€ continued the butler, his voice rising unnecessarily, â€œsheâ€™s the
only one what _is_ here. the partyâ€™s gone.â€

amory gasped in sudden horror.

â€œwhat?â€

â€œsheâ€™s been waitinâ€™ for amory blaine. thatâ€™s you, ainâ€™t it? her mother
says that if you showed up by five-thirty you two was to go after â€˜em in
the packard.â€

amoryâ€™s despair was crystallized by the appearance of myra herself,
bundled to the ears in a polo coat, her face plainly sulky, her voice
pleasant only with difficulty.

â€œâ€˜lo, amory.â€

â€œâ€˜lo, myra.â€ he had described the state of his vitality.

â€œwell--you _got_ here, _any_ways.â€

â€œwell--iâ€™ll tell you. i guess you donâ€™t know about the auto accide

accordion tie and a â€œbelmontâ€ collar with the edges unassailably
meeting, purple socks, and handkerchief with a purple border peeping
from his breast pocket. but more than that, he had formulated his first
philosophy, a code to live by, which, as near as it can be named, was a
sort of aristocratic egotism.

he had realized that his best interests were bound up with those of a
certain variant, changing person, whose label, in order that his past
might always be identified with him, was amory blaine. amory marked
himself a fortunate youth, capable of infinite expansion for good or
evil. he did not consider himself a â€œstrong charâ€™câ€™ter,â€ but relied on
his facility (learn things sorta quick) and his superior mentality (read
a lotta deep books). he was proud of the fact that he could never
become a mechanical or scientific genius. from no other heights was he
debarred.

cheers... finally bruised and weary, but still elusive, circling an end,

goal with two men on his legs, in the only touchdown of the game.

the philosophy of the slicker

from the scoffing superiority of sixth-form year and success amory
looked back with cynical wonder on his status of the year before. he was
changed as completely as amory blaine could ever be changed. amory plus
beatrice plus two years in minneapolis--these had been his ingredients
when he entered st. regisâ€™. but the minneapolis years were not a thick
enough overlay to conceal the â€œamory plus beatriceâ€ from the ferreting
eyes of a boarding-school, so st. regisâ€™ had very painfully drilled
beatrice out of him, and begun to lay down new and more conventional
planking on the fundamental amory. but both st. regisâ€™ and amory were
unconscious of the fact that this f

â€œi had to send back to the house for another pair of slippers. itâ€™ll be
just a minute.â€

isabelle started toward the dressing-room for a last peek in the mirror,
but something decided her to stand there and gaze down the broad stairs
of the minnehaha club. they curved tantalizingly, and she could catch
just a glimpse of two pairs of masculine feet in the hall below.
pump-shod in uniform black, they gave no hint of identity, but she
wondered eagerly if one pair were attached to amory blaine. this young
man, not as yet encountered, had nevertheless taken up a considerable
part of her day--the first day of her arrival. coming up in the machine
from the station, sally had volunteered, amid a rain of question,
comment, revelation, and exaggeration:

â€œyou remember amory blaine, of _course_. well, heâ€™s simply mad to
see you again. heâ€™s stayed over a day from college, and heâ€™s coming
to-night. heâ€™s heard so much about you--says he remembers your eyes.â€

cousins were produced from the corners where they skulked politely.
isabelle met them tactfully. at her best she allied all with whom she
came in contact--except older girls and some women. all the impressions
she made were conscious. the half-dozen girls she renewed acquaintance
with that morning were all rather impressed and as much by her direct
personality as by her reputation. amory blaine was an open subject.
evidently a bit light of love, neither popular nor unpopular--every girl
there seemed to have had an affair with him at some time or other, but
no one volunteered any really useful information. he was going to fall
for her.... sally had published that information to her young set
and they were retailing it back to sally as fast as they set eyes on
isabelle. isabelle resolved secretly that she would, if necessary,
_force_ herself to like him--she owed it to sally. suppose sh

and you and i will still shout our futilities to each other across
the stage until the last silly curtain falls _plump!_ upon our bobbing
heads. but you are starting the spluttering magic-lantern show of life
with much the same array of slides as i had, so i need to write you if
only to shriek the colossal stupidity of people....

this is the end of one thing: for better or worse you will never again
be quite the amory blaine that i knew, never again will we meet as we
have met, because your generation is growing hard, much harder than mine
ever grew, nourished as they were on the stuff of the nineties.

amory, lately i reread aeschylus and there in the divine irony of the
â€œagamemnonâ€ i find the only answer to this bitter age--all the world
tumbled about our ears, and the closest parallel ages back in that
hopeless resignation. there are times when i think of the men out there

(she sees herself in the mirror of the dressing-table and commences to
shimmy enthusiastically.)

rosalind: (outside) what are you doing--trying it on?

(cecelia ceases and goes out carrying the garment at the right shoulder.

from the other door, enters alec connage. he looks around quickly and in
a huge voice shouts: mama! there is a chorus of protest from next door
and encouraged he starts toward it, but is repelled by another chorus.)

alec: so _thatâ€™s_ where you all are! amory blaine is here.

cecelia: (quickly) take him down-stairs.

alec: oh, he _is_ down-stairs.

mrs. connage: well, you can show him where his room is. tell him iâ€™m
sorry that i canâ€™t meet him now.

alec: heâ€™s heard a lot about you all. i wish youâ€™d hurry. fatherâ€™s
telling him all about the war and heâ€™s restless. heâ€™s sort of
temperamental.

(this last suffices to draw cecelia into the room.)

cecelia: (seating herself high upon lingerie) how do you
mean--temperamental? you used to say that a

drink as much as you want. (she pauses.) heâ€™ll be a little neglected
to-night. this is rosalindâ€™s week, you see. when a girl comes out, she
needs _all_ the attention.

rosalind: (outside) well, then, prove it by coming here and hooking me.

(mrs. connage goes.)

alec: rosalind hasnâ€™t changed a bit.

cecelia: (in a lower tone) sheâ€™s awfully spoiled.

alec: sheâ€™ll meet her match to-night.

cecelia: who--mr. amory blaine?

(alec nods.)

cecelia: well, rosalind has still to meet the man she canâ€™t outdistance.
honestly, alec, she treats men terribly. she abuses them and cuts them
and breaks dates with them and yawns in their faces--and they come back
for more.

alec: they love it.

cecelia: they hate it. sheâ€™s a--sheâ€™s a sort of vampire, i think--and
she can make girls do what she wants usually--only she hates girls.

alec: personality runs in our family.

alind: the unfortunate part is that the only men who interest me at
all are the totally ineligible ones. now--if i were poor iâ€™d go on the

cecelia: yes, you might as well get paid for the amount of acting you
do.

rosalind: sometimes when iâ€™ve felt particularly radiant iâ€™ve thought,
why should this be wasted on one man?

cecelia: often when youâ€™re particularly sulky, iâ€™ve wondered why it
should all be wasted on just one family. (getting up.) i think iâ€™ll go
down and meet mr. amory blaine. i like temperamental men.

rosalind: there arenâ€™t any. men donâ€™t know how to be really angry or
really happy--and the ones that do, go to pieces.

cecelia: well, iâ€™m glad i donâ€™t have all your worries. iâ€™m engaged.

rosalind: (with a scornful smile) engaged? why, you little lunatic!
if mother heard you talking like that sheâ€™d send you off to
boarding-school, where you belong.

cecelia: you wonâ€™t tell her, though, because i know things i could
tell--and youâ€™re too selfish!

rosalind: oh, be _sure_ and do that--youâ€™re such a help.

(exit cecelia. rosalind finished her hair and rises, humming. she goes
up to the mirror and starts to dance in front of it on the soft carpet.
she watches not her feet, but her eyes--never casually but always
intently, even when she smiles. the door suddenly opens and then slams
behind amory, very cool and handsome as usual. he melts into instant
confusion.)

he: oh, iâ€™m sorry. i thought--

she: (smiling radiantly) oh, youâ€™re amory blaine, arenâ€™t you?

he: (regarding her closely) and youâ€™re rosalind?

she: iâ€™m going to call you amory--oh, come in--itâ€™s all right--motherâ€™ll
be right in--(under her breath) unfortunately.

atlantic city. amory paced the board walk at dayâ€™s end, lulled by the
everlasting surge of changing waves, smelling the half-mournful odor of
the salt breeze. the sea, he thought, had treasured its memories deeper
than the faithless land. it seemed still to whisper of norse galleys
ploughing the water world under raven-figured flags, of the british
dreadnoughts, gray bulwarks of civilization steaming up through the fog
of one dark july into the north sea.

â€œwell--amory blaine!â€

amory looked down into the street below. a low racing car had drawn to a
stop and a familiar cheerful face protruded from the driverâ€™s seat.

â€œcome on down, goopher!â€ cried alec.

amory called a greeting and descending a flight of wooden steps
approached the car. he and alec had been meeting intermittently, but the
barrier of rosalind lay always between them. he was sorry for this; he
hated to lose alec.

â€œmr. blaine, this is miss waterson, miss wayne, and mr. tully.â€

â€œhe used to be. he probably wonâ€™t want to be any more--and never
understand why.â€

â€œit was sorta crazy you takinâ€™ all that blame. is he pretty important?
kinda more important than you are?â€

amory laughed.

â€œthat remains to be seen,â€ he answered. â€œthatâ€™s the question.â€

the collapse of several pillars

two days later back in new york amory found in a newspaper what he
had been searching for--a dozen lines which announced to whom it might
concern that mr. amory blaine, who â€œgave his addressâ€ as, etc., had been
requested to leave his hotel in atlantic city because of entertaining in
his room a lady _not_ his wife.

then he started, and his fingers trembled, for directly above was a
longer paragraph of which the first words were:

â€œmr. and mrs. leland r. connage are announcing the engagement of their
daughter, rosalind, to mr. j. dawson ryder, of hartford, connecticut--â€

he dropped the paper and lay down on his bed with a frightened, sinking
sensation
