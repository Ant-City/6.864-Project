reach the door. tilting a little down the hill, as 
our house does, a breeze draws through the hall all the time, upslanting. a 
feather dropped near the front door will rise and brush along the ceiling, 
slanting backward, until it reaches the down-turning current at the back door: 
so with voices. as you enter the hall, they sound as though they were speaking 
out of the air about your head.

it was the sweetest thing i ever saw. it was like he knew he would never see her 
again, that anse bundren was driving him from his mother's death bed, never to 
see her in this world again. i always said darl was different from those others. 
i always said he was the only one of them that had his mother's nature, had any 
natural affection. not that jewel, the one she labored so to bear and coddled 
and petted so and him flinging into tantrums or sulking spells, inventing 
devilment to devil her until i would have trailed him time and time. not him to 
come and tell her goodbye. not him to miss a c

begged them on his knees not to force him to leave her in her condition. but 
nothing would do but anse and jewel must make that three dollars. nobody that 
knows anse could have expected different, but to think of that boy, that jewel, 
selling all those years of self-denial and down-right partialityâ€” they couldn't 
fool me: mr tull says mrs bundren liked jewel the least of all, but i knew 
better. i knew she was partial to him, to the same quality in him that let her 
put up with anse bundren when mr tull said she ought to poisoned him~for three 
dollars, denying his dying mother the goodbye kiss. 
why, for the last three weeks i have been coming over every time i could, 
coming sometimes when i shouldn't have, neglecting my own family and duties so 
that somebody would be with her in her last moments and she would not have to 
face the great unknown without one familiar face to give her courage. not that i 
deserve credit for it: i will expect the same for myself. but thank god it

cinders dumped over there, and there is no wind. i could hear cash sawing for a 
mile before i got there. anse is standing at the top of the bluff above the 
path. 

"where's the horse?" i say. 

"jewel's taken and gone," he says. "cant nobody else ketch hit. you'll 
have to walk up, i reckon." 

"me, walk up, weighing two hundred and twenty-five pounds?" i say. "walk 
up that durn wall?" he stands there beside a tree. too bad the lord made the 
mistake of giving trees roots and giving the anse bundrens he makes feet and 
legs. if he'd just swapped them, there wouldn't ever be a worry about this 
country being deforested someday. or any other country. "what do you aim for me 
to do?" i say. "stay here and get blowed clean out .of the county when that 
cloud breaks?" even with the horse it would take me fifteen minutes to ride up 
across the pasture to the top of the ridge and reach the house. the path looks 
like a crooked limb blown against the bluff. anse has not been in town in twelve

he sees it. 

when i come back to the house with the team, they was in the kitchen. she 

was dressed on top of her nightgownd, with a shawl over her head and her 

umbrella and her bible wrapped up in the oilcloth, and him sitting on a upturned 

bucket on the stove-zinc where she had put him, dripping onto the floor. 

i cant get nothing outen him except about a fish," she says. it's a judgment on 

them. i see the hand of the lord upon this boy for anse bundrens judgment and 

warning." 

"the rain never come up till after i left," he says. "i had done left. i 

was on the way. and so it was there in the dust. you seen it. cash is fixing to 

nail her, but you seen it." 

when we got there it was raining hard, and him sitting on the seat between 

us, wrapped up in cora's shawl. he hadn't said nothing else, just sitting there 

with cora holding the umbrella over him. now and then cora would stop singing 

long enough to say "it's a judgment on anse b

so he couldn't open the window on her no more. and the next morning they found 

him in his shirt tail, laying asleep on the floor like a felled steer, and the 

top of the box bored clean full of holes and cash's new auger broke off in the 

last one. when they taken the lid off they found that two of them had bored on 

into her face. 

if it's a judgment, it aint right. because the lord's got more to do than 

that. he's bound to have. because the only burden anse bundren's ever had is 

himself. and when folks talks him low, i think to myself he aint that less of a 

man or he couldn't a bore himself this long. 

it aint right. i be durn if it is. because he said suffer little children 

to come unto me dont make it right, neither. cora said, i have bore you what the 

lord god sent me. i faced it without fear nor terror because my faith was strong 

in the lord, a-bolstering and sustaining me. if you have no son, it's because 

the lord has decreed otherwise i

ed into the air and when we moved we would loose them again out of the 
air around us, sad and comforting. then they finish and we put on our hats, our 
movements stiff, like we hadn't never wore hats before. 
on the way home cora is still singing. "i am bounding toward my god and my 
reward," she sings, sitting on the wagon, the shawl around her shoulder and the 
umbrella open over her, though it is not raining. 

"she has hern," i say. "wherever she went, she has her reward in being 

free of anse bundren." she laid there three days in that box, waiting for darl 

and jewel to come clean back home and get a new wheel and go back to where the 

wagon was in the ditch. take my team, anse, i said. 

we'll wait for ourn, he said. she'll want it so. she was ever a 

particular woman. 

on the third day they got back and they loaded her into the wagon and 
started and it already too late. you'll have to go all the way round by 
samson's bridge. it'll take you a day to get there. then you'll be forty m

but i aint so sho that ere a man has the right to say what is crazy and

i said, "i reckon a man in a tight might let bill varner patch him up like a 

damn mule, but i be damned if the man that'd let anse bundren treat him with raw 

cement aint got more spare legs than i have." 

"they just aimed to ease hit some," he said. 

"aimed, hell," i said. "what in hell did armstid mean by even letting them 
put you on that wagon again?" 

"hit was gittin right noticeable," he said. "we never had time to wait." i 

just looked at him. "hit never bothered me none," he said. 

"dont you lie there and try to tell me you rode six days on a wagon 

without springs, with a broken leg and it never bothered you."
