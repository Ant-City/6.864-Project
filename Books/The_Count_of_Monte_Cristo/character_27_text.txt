â€œcannot sail without her captain.â€

â€œwithout her captain!â€ cried dantÃ¨s, his eyes sparkling with animation;
â€œpray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes
of my heart. is it really your intention to make me captain of the
_pharaon_?â€

â€œif i were sole owner weâ€™d shake hands on it now, my dear dantÃ¨s, and
call it settled; but i have a partner, and you know the italian proverb-
-_chi ha compagno ha padrone_--â€˜he who has a partner has a master.â€™ but
the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of two votes. rely
on me to procure you the other; i will do my best.â€

â€œah, m. morrel,â€ exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes, and
grasping the ownerâ€™s hand, â€œm. morrel, i thank you in the name of my
father and of mercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œthatâ€™s all right, edmond. thereâ€™s a providence that watches over the

from five oâ€™clock in the morning until nine oâ€™clock at night, swarms in
the famous street of la canebiÃ¨re,--a street of which the modern
phocÃ©ens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world,
and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, â€œif
paris had la canebiÃ¨re, paris would be a second marseilles.â€ on turning
round the owner saw danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders, but
in reality also watching the young sailor,--but there was a great
difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the
movements of edmond dantÃ¨s.



chapter 2. father and son

we will leave danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and
endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil
suspicions against his comrade, and follow dantÃ¨s, who, after having
traversed la canebiÃ¨re, took the rue de noailles, and entering a small
house, on the left of the allÃ©es de meillan, ra

as edmond paused, the black and bearded head of caderousse appeared at
the door. he was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth,
which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.

â€œwhat, is it you, edmond, back again?â€ said he, with a broad
marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.

â€œyes, as you see, neighbor caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you
in any and every way,â€ replied dantÃ¨s, but ill-concealing his coldness
under this cloak of civility.

â€œthanks--thanks; but, fortunately, i do not want for anything; and it
chances that at times there are others who have need of me.â€ dantÃ¨s made
a gesture. â€œi do not allude to you, my boy. no!--no! i lent you money,
and you returned it; thatâ€™s like good neighbors, and we are quits.â€

â€œwe are never quits with those who oblige us,â€ was dantÃ¨sâ€™ reply; â€œfor
when we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.â€

but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water
unnecessarily!â€

fernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into
his hands, his elbows leaning on the table.

â€œwell, fernand, i must say,â€ said caderousse, beginning the
conversation, with that brutality of the common people in which
curiosity destroys all diplomacy, â€œyou look uncommonly like a rejected
lover;â€ and he burst into a hoarse laugh.

â€œbah!â€ said danglars, â€œa lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in
love. you are laughing at him, caderousse.â€

â€œno,â€ he replied, â€œonly hark how he sighs! come, come, fernand,â€ said
caderousse, â€œhold up your head, and answer us. itâ€™s not polite not to

bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from
his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his
rival, when mercÃ©dÃ¨s, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head,
and looked at them with her clear and bright eyes. at this fernand
recollected her threat of dying if edmond died, and dropped again
heavily on his seat. danglars looked at the two men, one after the
other, the one brutalized by liquor, the other overwhelmed with love.

â€œi shall get nothing from these fools,â€ he muttered; â€œand i am very much
afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward. hereâ€™s an envious
fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his
wrath, and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under
his nose and takes on like a big baby. yet this catalan has eyes that

â€œthe truth is,â€ replied dantÃ¨s, â€œthat i am too happy for noisy mirth; if
that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you are
right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us
almost the same as sorrow.â€

danglars looked towards fernand, whose excitable nature received and
betrayed each fresh impression.

â€œwhy, what ails you?â€ asked he of edmond. â€œdo you fear any approaching
evil? i should say that you were the happiest man alive at this
instant.â€

â€œand that is the very thing that alarms me,â€ returned dantÃ¨s. â€œman does
not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness
is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where fierce,
fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of all
shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. i own
that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i
feel myself unworthy--that of being the hu

from uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the noisy
felicitations of the company.

â€œupon my word,â€ cried the old man, â€œyou make short work of this kind of
affair. arrived here only yesterday morning, and married today at three
oâ€™clock! commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!â€

â€œbut,â€ asked danglars, in a timid tone, â€œhow did you manage about the
other formalities--the contract--the settlement?â€

â€œthe contract,â€ answered dantÃ¨s, laughingly, â€œit didnâ€™t take long to fix
that. mercÃ©dÃ¨s has no fortune; i have none to settle on her. so, you
see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come very
expensive.â€ this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.

â€œso that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to
be the actual wedding dinner!â€ said danglars.

â€œno, no,â€ answered dantÃ¨s; â€œdonâ€™t imagine

carefully to the unloading of her freight. private misfortunes must
never be allowed to interfere with business.â€

â€œbe easy on that score, m. morrel; but do you think we shall be
permitted to see our poor edmond?â€

â€œi will let you know that directly i have seen m. de villefort, whom i
shall endeavor to interest in edmondâ€™s favor. i am aware he is a furious
royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being kingâ€™s attorney, he is
a man like ourselves, and i fancy not a bad sort of one.â€

â€œperhaps not,â€ replied danglars; â€œbut i hear that he is ambitious, and
thatâ€™s rather against him.â€

â€œwell, well,â€ returned m. morrel, â€œwe shall see. but now hasten on
board, i will join you there ere long.â€ so saying, the worthy shipowner
quitted the two allies, and proceeded in the direction of the palais de
justice.


â€œyou see,â€ said danglars,

â€œnever mind, renÃ©e,â€ replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness
that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however all
other feelings may be withered in a womanâ€™s nature, there is always one
bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the shrine
of maternal love. â€œi forgive you. what i was saying, villefort, was,
that the bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or devotion.â€

â€œthey had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,â€
 replied the young man, â€œand that was fanaticism. napoleon is the mahomet
of the west, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious
followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the
personification of equality.â€

â€œhe!â€ cried the marquise: â€œnapoleon the type of equality! for mercyâ€™s
sake, then, what would you call robespierre? come, come, do not strip
the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the corsican, who, to my
mind, has usurped quite enough.â€

â€œnay, madame; i would place each of these heroes on his right pedestal--
that of robespierre on his scaffold in the place louis quinze; that of
napoleon on the column of the place vendÃ´me. the only difference
consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these
two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the equality
that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine, the
other elevates the people to a level with the throne. observe,â€ said
villefort, smiling, â€œi do not mean to deny that both these men were
revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th thermidor and the 4th of
april, in the year 1814, were lucky days for france, worthy of being
gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and
that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as i trust he is

â€œsuffer me, also, madame,â€ replied villefort, â€œto add my earnest request
to mademoiselle de saint-mÃ©ranâ€™s, that you will kindly allow the veil of
oblivion to cover and conceal the past. what avails recrimination over
matters wholly past recall? for my own part, i have laid aside even the
name of my father, and altogether disown his political principles. he
was--nay, probably may still be--a bonapartist, and is called noirtier;
i, on the contrary, am a staunch royalist, and style myself de
villefort. let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and
die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to regard the young
shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree, without
having the power, any more than the wish, to separate entirely from the
stock from which it sprung.â€

â€œbravo, villefort!â€ cried the marquis; â€œexcellently well said! come,
now, i have hopes of obtaining what i have been for years endeavoring to

conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the offenders to
merited punishment. but we have not done with the thing yet.â€


â€œdo you, indeed, think so?â€ inquired the marquise.

â€œi am, at least, fearful of it. napoleon, in the island of elba, is too
near france, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.
marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one
frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists; from
hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of
persons, and assassinations in the lower.â€

â€œyou have heard, perhaps,â€ said the comte de salvieux, one of m. de
saint-mÃ©ranâ€™s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the comte dâ€™artois,
â€œthat the holy alliance purpose removing him from thence?â€

â€œyes; they were talking about it when we left paris,â€ said m. de saint-

â€œand one which will go far to efface the recollection of his fatherâ€™s
conduct,â€ added the incorrigible marquise.

â€œmadame,â€ replied villefort, with a mournful smile, â€œi have already had
the honor to observe that my father has--at least, i hope so--abjured
his past errors, and that he is, at the present moment, a firm and
zealous friend to religion and order--a better royalist, possibly, than
his son; for he has to atone for past dereliction, while i have no other
impulse than warm, decided preference and conviction.â€ having made this
well-turned speech, villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect
of his oratory, much as he would have done had he been addressing the
bench in open court.

exactly what i myself said the other day at the tuileries, when

her dry bony hand to villefort, who, while imprinting a son-in-lawâ€™s
respectful salute on it, looked at renÃ©e, as much as to say, â€œi must try

â€œthese are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal,â€ sighed poor
renÃ©e.

â€œupon my word, child!â€ exclaimed the angry marquise, â€œyour folly exceeds
all bounds. i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly
be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state!â€

â€œo mother!â€ murmured renÃ©e.

â€œnay, madame, i pray you pardon this little traitor. i promise you that
to make up for her want of loyalty, i will be most inflexibly severe;â€
 then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed, which seemed to say,
â€œfear not, for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy,â€
 and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return, villefort quitted
the room.

â€œoh,â€ said morrel, carried away by his friendship, â€œyou do not know him,
and i do. he is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in the
world, and i will venture to say, there is not a better seaman in all
the merchant service. oh, m. de villefort, i beseech your indulgence for
him.â€

villefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at
marseilles, morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other
suspected of bonapartism. villefort looked disdainfully at morrel, and
replied,--

â€œyou are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in
private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be,
politically speaking, a great criminal. is it not true?â€

the magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply
them to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into the
heart of one who, interceding for another, had himself need

ardhouse,
a dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order; dantÃ¨s saw the
reflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay.

â€œcan all this force be summoned on my account?â€ thought he.

the officer opened the door, which was locked, and, without speaking a
word, answered dantÃ¨sâ€™ question; for he saw between the ranks of the
soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port. the two
gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered
to alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example.
they advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a
chain, near the quay.

the soldiers looked at dantÃ¨s with an air of stupid curiosity. in an
instant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the
gendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent
the boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the
pilon. at a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mou

and good thick walls. come, come, do not look so astonished, or you will
make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature.â€
 dantÃ¨s pressed the gendarmeâ€™s hand as though he would crush it.

â€œyou think, then,â€ said he, â€œthat i am taken to the chÃ¢teau dâ€™if to be
imprisoned there?â€

â€œit is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.â€

â€œwithout any inquiry, without any formality?â€

â€œall the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already
made.â€

â€œand so, in spite of m. de villefortâ€™s promises?â€

â€œi do not know what m. de villefort promised you,â€ said the gendarme,
â€œbut i know we are taking you to the chÃ¢teau dâ€™if. but what are you
doing? help, comrades, help!â€

by a rapid movement, which the gendarmeâ€™s practiced eye had perceived,
dantÃ¨s sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea; but four
vigorous arms seized him as his f

in its cage. one thought in particular
tormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so
still, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and,
thanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained
the shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish
vessel, escaped to spain or italy, where mercÃ©dÃ¨s and his father could
have joined him. he had no fears as to how he should live--good seamen
are welcome everywhere. he spoke italian like a tuscan, and spanish like
a castilian; he would have been free, and happy with mercÃ©dÃ¨s and his
father, whereas he was now confined in the chÃ¢teau dâ€™if, that
impregnable fortress, ignorant of the future destiny of his father and
mercÃ©dÃ¨s; and all this because he had trusted to villefortâ€™s promise.
the thought was maddening, and dantÃ¨s threw himself furiously down on
his straw. the next morning at the same hour, the jailer came again.

â€œwell,â€ said the jailer, â€œare you mo

defensive; â€œyou are certainly going mad. the abbÃ© began like you, and in
three days you will be like him, mad enough to tie up; but, fortunately,
there are dungeons here.â€ dantÃ¨s whirled the stool round his head.

â€œall right, all right,â€ said the jailer; â€œall right, since you will have
it so. i will send word to the governor.â€

â€œvery well,â€ returned dantÃ¨s, dropping the stool and sitting on it as if
he were in reality mad. the jailer went out, and returned in an instant
with a corporal and four soldiers.

â€œby the governorâ€™s orders,â€ said he, â€œconduct the prisoner to the tier
beneath.â€

â€œto the dungeon, then,â€ said the corporal.

â€œyes; we must put the madman with the madmen.â€ the soldiers seized
dantÃ¨s, who followed passively.

he descended fifteen steps, and the door of a dungeon was opened, and he
was thrust in. the door closed, and dantÃ¨s advanced with outstretched
hands until he touc

chapter 9. the evening of the betrothal

villefort had, as we have said, hastened back to madame de saint-mÃ©ranâ€™s
in the place du grand cours, and on entering the house found that the
guests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon. renÃ©e
was, with all the rest of the company, anxiously awaiting him, and his
entrance was followed by a general exclamation.

â€œwell, decapitator, guardian of the state, royalist, brutus, what is the
matter?â€ said one. â€œspeak out.â€

â€œare we threatened with a fresh reign of terror?â€ asked another.

â€œhas the corsican ogre broken loose?â€ cried a third.

â€œmarquise,â€ said villefort, approaching his future mother-in-law, â€œi
request your pardon for thus leaving you. will the marquis honor me by a
few momentsâ€™ private conversation?â€

â€œah, it is really a serious matter, then?â€ asked the marquis, remarking
the cloud on villefortâ€™s brow.

â€œso seri

and, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to sell
out at the market price.

â€œnow, then,â€ said villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, â€œi
must have another!â€

â€œto whom?â€

â€œto the king.â€

â€œto the king?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œi dare not write to his majesty.â€

â€œi do not ask you to write to his majesty, but ask m. de salvieux to do
so. i want a letter that will enable me to reach the kingâ€™s presence
without all the formalities of demanding an audience; that would
occasion a loss of precious time.â€

â€œbut address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right of
entry at the tuileries, and can procure you audience at any hour of the
day or night.â€

â€œdoubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my
discovery with him. the keeper would leave me in the background, and
take all the glory to himself. i tell you, marquis, my fortune is made
if i only reach the tuileries the first, for the kin

of mercÃ©dÃ¨s, and villefort instantly recognized her. her beauty
and high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become of
her lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the accused.

â€œthe young man you speak of,â€ said villefort abruptly, â€œis a great
criminal, and i can do nothing for him, mademoiselle.â€ mercÃ©dÃ¨s burst
into tears, and, as villefort strove to pass her, again addressed him.

â€œbut, at least, tell me where he is, that i may know whether he is alive
or dead,â€ said she.

â€œi do not know; he is no longer in my hands,â€ replied villefort.


and desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and
closed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. but remorse is not
thus banished; like virgilâ€™s wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his
wound, and, arrived at the salon, villefort uttered a sigh that was
almost a sob, and sank into a chair.

then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. the
man he sacr

â€œand your majesty has employed the son of such a man?â€

â€œblacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension. i told you
villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition villefort would
sacrifice everything, even his father.â€

â€œthen, sire, may i present him?â€

â€œthis instant, duke! where is he?â€

â€œwaiting below, in my carriage.â€

â€œseek him at once.â€

â€œi hasten to do so.â€ the duke left the royal presence with the speed of
a young man; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again. louis
xviii. remained alone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened horace,
muttered,--

â€œ_justum et tenacem propositi virum_.â€

m. de blacas returned as speedily as he had departed, but in the
antechamber he was forced to appeal to the kingâ€™s authority. villefortâ€™s
dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut, excited the
susceptibility of m. de brezÃ©, who was all astonishment at finding that
this young man had the audacity to enter before the king

s more than a plot; i fear it is a conspiracy.â€

â€œa conspiracy in these times,â€ said louis xviii., smiling, â€œis a thing
very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch
as, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have
our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future. for
the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance, in
order to watch the shore of the mediterranean. if bonaparte landed at
naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach
piombino; if he land in tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly territory;
if he land in france, it must be with a handful of men, and the result
of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population. take
courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude.â€

â€œah, here is m. dandrÃ©!â€ cried de blacas. at this instant the minister
of police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready to
faint. villefort was abou

â€œso then,â€ he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, â€œseven conjoined and
allied armies overthrew that man. a miracle of heaven replaced me on the
throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of exile. i have,
during those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to understand the
people of france and the interests which were confided to me; and now,
when i see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the power i
hold in my hands bursts and shatters me to atoms!â€

â€œsire, it is fatality!â€ murmured the minister, feeling that the pressure
of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too much for any
human strength to endure.

â€œwhat our enemies say of us is then true. we have learnt nothing,
forgotten nothing! if i were betrayed as he was, i would console myself;
but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor,
who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,--for my
fortune is theirs--before me they were nothing--after me t

the minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. m. de blacas wiped
the moisture from his brow. villefort smiled within himself, for he felt
his increased importance.

â€œto fall,â€ continued king louis, who at the first glance had sounded the
abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,--â€œto fall, and learn of that
fall by telegraph! oh, i would rather mount the scaffold of my brother,
louis xvi., than thus descend the staircase at the tuileries driven away

villefort understood the kingâ€™s intent. any other person would, perhaps,
have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but he
feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister,
although he saw that dandrÃ© was irrevocably lost. in fact, the minister,
who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth
napoleonâ€™s secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate
dantÃ¨s and so lay bare the motives of villefortâ€™s plot. realizing this,
villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of
aiding to crush him.

â€œsire,â€ said villefort, â€œthe suddenness of this event must prove to your
majesty that the issue is in the hands of providence; what your majesty
is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing
to chance, and i have profited by that chance, like a good and devoted

least.â€

â€œwe shall see. i will no longer detain you, m. de villefort, for you
must be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. of course you

â€œno, sire,â€ he replied, â€œi alighted at the hotel de madrid, in the rue

â€œbut you have seen him?â€

â€œsire, i went straight to the duc de blacas.â€

â€œbut you will see him, then?â€

these questions were not made without a motive; â€œi forgot you and m.

sacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be
recompensed.â€

would you like to know how matters have progressed? well, i will tell
you. it was thought reliance might be placed in general quesnel; he was
recommended to us from the island of elba; one of us went to him, and
invited him to the rue saint-jacques, where he would find some friends.
he came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving elba, the
projected landing, etc. when he had heard and comprehended all to the
fullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. then all looked at
each other,--he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an
ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus, and yet,
in spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free--perfectly
free. yet he did not return home. what could that mean? why, my dear
fellow, that on leaving us he lost his way, thatâ€™s all. a murder?
really, villefort, you surprise me. you, a deputy procureur, to found an
accusation on such bad premises! did i ever say to you,

turn.â€™â€

â€œbut, father, take care; when our turn comes, our revenge will be
sweeping.â€

â€œi do not understand you.â€

â€œyou rely on the usurperâ€™s return?â€

â€œwe do.â€

â€œdevotion!â€ said villefort, with a sneer.

â€œyes, devotion; for that is, i believe, the phrase for hopeful
ambition.â€

and villefortâ€™s father extended his hand to the bell-rope, to summon the
servant whom his son had not called. villefort caught his arm.

â€œwait, my dear father,â€ said the young man, â€œone word more.â€

â€œsay on.â€

â€œhowever stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one terrible
thing.â€

â€œwhat is that?â€

â€œthe description of the man who, on the morning of the day when general
quesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house.â€

â€œoh, the admirable police have found that out, have they? and what may
be that description?â€

â€œdark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers black; blue frock-coat,

my son--go, my dear gÃ©rard, and by your obedience to my paternal orders,

a second time save me, if the political balance should some day take
another turn, and cast you aloft while hurling me down. adieu, my dear
gÃ©rard, and at your next journey alight at my door.â€ noirtier left the
room when he had finished, with the same calmness that had characterized
him during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation.
villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window, put aside the curtain,
and saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or three ill-looking men at
the corner of the street, who were there, perhaps, to arrest a man with
black whiskers, and a blue frock-coat, and hat with broad brim.

villefort stood watching, breathless, until

 he had the prudence not to wear, although m. de blacas had

napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived villefort of his office had it
not been for noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the
girondin of â€˜93 and the senator of 1806 protected him who so lately had
been his protector. all villefortâ€™s influence barely enabled him to
stifle the secret dantÃ¨s had so nearly divulged. the kingâ€™s procureur
alone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.

however, scarcely was the imperial power established--that is, scarcely
had the emperor re-entered the tuileries and begun to issue orders from
the closet into which we have introduced our readers,--he found on the
table there louis xviii.â€™s half-filled snuff-box,--scarcely had this
occurred when marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to rekindle
the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and it
required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater

owing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment--we
will not say all powerful, because morrel was a prudent and rather a

bonaparte accused him of â€œmoderationâ€--but sufficiently influential to
make a demand in favor of dantÃ¨s.

expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the otherâ€™s
condescension. villefort had calculated rightly.

â€œno,â€ said morrel; â€œi am not mistaken. i have known him for ten years,
the last four of which he was in my service. do not you recollect, i
came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as i come today to plead
for justice. you received me very coldly. oh, the royalists were very
severe with the bonapartists in those days.â€

â€œmonsieur,â€ returned villefort, â€œi was then a royalist, because i
believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the chosen
of the nation. the miraculous return of napoleon has conquered me, the
legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.â€

â€œthatâ€™s right!â€ cried morrel. â€œi like to hear you speak thus, and i

to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.â€

â€œdo not be too hasty, m. morrel,â€ replied villefort. â€œthe order of
imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation
must proceed from the same source; and, as napoleon has scarcely been
reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.â€

â€œbut,â€ said morrel, â€œis there no way of expediting all these
formalities--of releasing him from arrest?â€

â€œthere has been no arrest.â€

â€œhow?â€

â€œit is sometimes essential to government to cause a manâ€™s disappearance
without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may
defeat their wishes.â€

â€œoh, that is different,â€ cried the abbÃ©; â€œand we shall understand each

â€œthere, now,â€ whispered the governor, â€œit is just as i told you.â€

â€œmonsieur,â€ continued the prisoner, â€œi am the abbÃ© faria, born at rome.
i was for twenty years cardinal spadaâ€™s secretary; i was arrested, why,
i know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then i have
demanded my liberty from the italian and french government.â€

â€œwhy from the french government?â€

â€œbecause i was arrested at piombino, and i presume that, like milan and
florence, piombino has become the capital of some french department.â€

â€œah,â€ said the inspector, â€œyou have not the latest news from italy?â€

â€œmy information dates from the day on which i was arrested,â€ returned
the abbÃ© faria; â€œand as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for
his infant son, i presume that he has realized the dream

the governor laughed. â€œis the spot far from here?â€

â€œa hundred leagues.â€

â€œit is not ill-planned,â€ said the governor. â€œif all the prisoners took
it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians
consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of
escaping.â€

â€œthe scheme is well known,â€ said the inspector; â€œand the abbÃ©â€™s plan has
not even the merit of originality.â€

then turning to faria--â€œi inquired if you are well fed?â€ said he.

â€œswear to me,â€ replied faria, â€œto free me if what i tell you prove true,
and i will stay here while you go to the spot.â€

â€œare you well fed?â€ repeated the inspector.

â€œmonsieur, you run no risk, for, as i told you, i will stay here; so
there is no chance of my escaping.â€

â€œyou do not reply to my question,â€ replied the inspector impatiently.

â€œnor you to mine,â€ cried the abbÃ©. â€œyou will not a

â€œcounting his treasures,â€ replied the governor.

faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. they
went out. the turnkey closed the door behind them.

â€œhe was wealthy once, perhaps?â€ said the inspector.

â€œor dreamed he was, and awoke mad.â€

â€œafter all,â€ said the inspector, â€œif he had been rich, he would not have
been here.â€ so the matter ended for the abbÃ© faria. he remained in his
cell, and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity.


caligula or nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the
impossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his
wealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. but the kings of modern
times, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither
courage nor desire. they fear the ear that hears their orders, and the
eye that scrutinizes their actions. formerly they believed themselves
sprung from jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are
not inviolable.

and the unhappy young man was no longer called edmond dantÃ¨s--he was now
number 34.



chapter 15. number 34 and number 27

dantes passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in
suspense. he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence
which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own innocence,
which justified in some measure the governorâ€™s belief in his mental
alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he addressed his
supplications, not to god, but to man. god is always the last resource.
unfortunates, who ought to begin with god, do not have any hope in him
till they have exhausted all other means of deliverance.

dantÃ¨s asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another; for a
change, however disadvantageous, was still a change, and would afford
him some amusement. he entreated to be allowed to walk about, to have
fresh air, books,

 the eye glowing with celestial colors in martinâ€™s
babylonian pictures. he could not do this, he whose past life was so
short, whose present so melancholy, and his future so doubtful. nineteen
years of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness! no distraction could
come to his aid; his energetic spirit, that would have exalted in thus
revisiting the past, was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage. he clung to
one idea--that of his happiness, destroyed, without apparent cause, by
an unheard-of fatality; he considered and reconsidered this idea,
devoured it (so to speak), as the implacable ugolino devours the skull
of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante.

rage supplanted religious fervor. dantÃ¨s uttered blasphemies that made
his jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the
walls of his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly upon
himself, so that the least thing,--a grain of sand, a straw, or a breath
of air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury.

 and during the four days that
he had been carrying out his purpose, edmond had not spoken to the
attendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter
with him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously
at him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to it,
and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last
moments.

the jailer brought him his breakfast. dantÃ¨s raised himself up and began
to talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food, about the
coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order to have an
excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his jailer, who
out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his
prisoner.

fortunately, he fancied that dantÃ¨s was delirious; and placing the food
on the rickety table, he withdrew. edmond listened, and the sound became
more and more distinct.

â€œthere can be no doubt about it,â€ thought he; â€œit is some prisoner who

 a moment that part of the floor on which dantÃ¨s was resting his two
hands, as he knelt with his head in the opening, suddenly gave way; he
drew back smartly, while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a
hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed. then from
the bottom of this passage, the depth of which it was impossible to
measure, he saw appear, first the head, then the shoulders, and lastly
the body of a man, who sprang lightly into his cell.



chapter 16. a learned italian

seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired, dantÃ¨s
almost carried him towards the window, in order to obtain a better view
of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through
the grating.

he was a man of small stature, with hair blanched rather by suffering
and sorrow than by age. he had a deep-set, penetrating eye, almost
buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a long (and still black)
beard reaching down to his breast. his thin face, deeply furrow

the stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years; but a
certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it
probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time.
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with
evident pleasure, as though his chilled affections were rekindled and
invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent. he thanked him
with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at
that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where
he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.

â€œlet us first see,â€ said he, â€œwhether it is possible to remove the
traces of my entrance here--our future tranquillity depends upon our
jailers being entirely ignorant of it.â€ advancing to the opening, he
stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight; then,
fitting it into its place, he

â€ said the abbÃ©, turning
towards dantÃ¨s, and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet,
â€œyou are young, you will see all this come to pass.â€

â€œprobably, if ever i get out of prison!â€

â€œtrue,â€ replied faria, â€œwe are prisoners; but i forget this sometimes,
and there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond
these walls, and i fancy myself at liberty.â€

â€œbut wherefore are you here?â€

â€œbecause in 1807 i dreamed of the very plan napoleon tried to realize in
1811; because, like machiavelli, i desired to alter the political face
of italy, and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of
petty principalities, each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler, i
sought to form one large, compact, and powerful empire; and, lastly,
because i fancied i had found my cÃ¦sar borgia in a crowned simpleton,
who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me. it was the plan of
alexander vi. and clement vii., but it will never succeed now, for they

could recite you the whole of thucydides, xenophon, plutarch, titus

â€œyou are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to
have been able to read all these?â€

â€œyes, i speak five of the modern tongues--that is to say, german,
french, italian, english, and spanish; by the aid of ancient greek i
learned modern greek--i donâ€™t speak it so well as i could wish, but i am
still trying to improve myself.â€

â€œimprove yourself!â€ repeated dantÃ¨s; â€œwhy, how can you manage to do so?â€

â€œwhy, i made a vocabulary of the words i knew; turned, returned, and
arranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through their
medium. i know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is
absolutely necessary, although i believe ther

cles mentioned to dantÃ¨s.


â€œwhat do you wish to see first?â€ asked the abbÃ©.

â€œoh, your great work on the monarchy of italy!â€

faria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of
linen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus. these rolls
consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long;
they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so
legible that dantÃ¨s could easily read it, as well as make out the sense-
-it being in italian, a language he, as a provenÃ§al, perfectly
understood.

â€œthere,â€ said he, â€œthere is the work complete. i wrote the word _finis_
at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago. i have torn up
two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as i was master of, to
complete the precious pages. should i ever get out of prison and find in
all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed,
my literary reputation is forever secured.â€

â€œi see,â€ answered dantÃ¨s. â€œn

ofound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had
formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a
solemn oath.

dantÃ¨s was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of faria, who,
having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his fellow-
sufferer to share his supper. the reputation of being out of his mind,
though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the abbÃ©
unusual privileges. he was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter
quality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each sunday with a
small quantity of wine. now this was a sunday, and the abbÃ© had come to
ask his young companion to share the luxuries with him. dantÃ¨s followed;
his features were no longer contracted, and now wore their usual
expression, but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one
who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. faria bent on him his
penetrating eye: â€œi regret now,â€ said he, â€œhaving helped you in your

dantÃ¨s, â€œwhat shall you teach me first? i am in a
hurry to begin. i want to learn.â€

â€œeverything,â€ said the abbÃ©. and that very evening the prisoners
sketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.
dantÃ¨s possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing
quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his mind
rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally
poetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality
of arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. he
already knew italian, and had also picked up a little of the romaic
dialect during voyages to the east; and by the aid of these two
languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so
that at the end of six months he began to speak spanish, english, and
german. in strict accordance with the promise made to the abbÃ©, dantÃ¨s
spoke no more of escape. perhaps the delight his studies afforded him
left no room

promise.â€

â€œit is well,â€ said dantÃ¨s. â€œthen i shall also remain.â€ then, rising and
extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old manâ€™s head, he
slowly added, â€œby the blood of christ i swear never to leave you while
you live.â€

faria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled
young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the
sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.

â€œthanks,â€ murmured the invalid, extending one hand. â€œi accept. you may
one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. but as
i cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary to
fill up the excavation beneath the soldierâ€™s gallery; he might, by
chance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention
of his officer to the circumstance. that would bring about a discovery
which would inevitably lead to our being separated. go, then, and set

the sweat started forth on dantÃ¨s brow. until this day and for how long
a time!--he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had
brought upon the abbÃ© the accusation of madness. with his instinctive
delicacy edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord,
and faria had been equally silent. he had taken the silence of the old
man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by faria,
after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into
mental alienation.

â€œyour treasure?â€ stammered dantÃ¨s. faria smiled.

â€œyes,â€ said he. â€œyou have, indeed, a noble nature, edmond, and i see by
your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this
moment. no, be assured, i am not mad. this treasure exists, dantÃ¨s, and
if i have not been allowed to possess it, you will. yes--you. no one
would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you,
who must know that i am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards

â€œi did. aided by the remaining fragment, i guessed the rest; measuring
the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden
meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a
cavern by the small ray of light above us.â€

â€œand what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?â€

â€œi resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying
with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the italian
kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period,
quite contrary to what napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to
him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my
hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having
aroused their suspicions, i was arrested at the very moment i was
leaving piombino.

which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. they had repaired it
completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole dantÃ¨s had
partly filled in. but for this precaution, which, it will be remembered,
the abbÃ© had made to edmond, the misfortune would have been still
greater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they
would undoubtedly have been separated. thus a new, a stronger, and more
inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their
hopes.

â€œyou see,â€ said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to
faria, â€œthat god deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for
what you call my devotion to you. i have promised to remain forever with
you, and now i could not break my promise if i would. the treasure will
be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this prison. but

during which dantÃ¨s, still listening, knew that the doctor was examining
the corpse a second time.

â€œyou may make your mind easy,â€ said the doctor; â€œhe is dead. i will
answer for that.â€

â€œyou know, sir,â€ said the governor, persisting, â€œthat we are not content
in such cases as this with such a simple examination. in spite of all
appearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by fulfilling
the formalities described by law.â€

â€œlet the irons be heated,â€ said the doctor; â€œbut really it is a useless
precaution.â€ this order to heat the irons made dantÃ¨s shudder. he heard
hasty steps, the creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some
minutes afterwards a turnkey entered, saying,--

â€œhere is the brazier, lighted.â€ there was a momentâ€™s silence, and then
was heard the crackling of burning flesh, of which the peculiar and
nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where da

â€œnever, sir,â€ replied the jailer, â€œnever; on the contrary, he sometimes
amused me very much by telling me stories. one day, too, when my wife
was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.â€

â€œah, ah!â€ said the doctor, â€œi did not know that i had a rival; but i
hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect.â€

â€œyes, yes, make your mind easy, he shall be decently interred in the
newest sack we can find. will that satisfy you?â€

â€œmust this last formality take place in your presence, sir?â€ inquired a
turnkey.

â€œcertainly. but make haste--i cannot stay here all day.â€ other
footsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards the
noise of rustling canvas reached dantÃ¨sâ€™ ears, the bed creaked, and the
heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor; then
the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.

laughter followed this brutal jest. meanwhile the operation of putting
the body in the sack was going on.

â€œthis evening,â€ said the governor, when the task was ended.

â€œat what hour?â€ inquired a turnkey.

â€œwhy, about ten or eleven oâ€™clock.â€

â€œshall we watch by the corpse?â€

â€œof what use would it be? shut the dungeon as if he were alive--that is
all.â€ then the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the
distance; the noise of the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts
ceased, and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued,--the
silence of death, which was all-pervasive, and struck its icy chill to
the very soul of dantÃ¨s. then he raised the flag-stone cautiously with
his head, and looked carefully around the chamber. it was empty, and
dantÃ¨s emerged from the tunnel.

cap, and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailors. this time he was
both seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him. at
the same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat.

an instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards
him. dantÃ¨s let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless,
and swam vigorously to meet them. but he had reckoned too much upon his
strength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to
him. his arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was
almost breathless.

he shouted again. the two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of
them cried in italian, â€œcourage!â€

the word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength
to surmount passed over his head. he rose again to the surface,
struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a
third cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fata

the third, an old sailor, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with
that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped
yesterday, and which may overtake them tomorrow.

a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction
of his limbs restored their elasticity.

â€œwho are you?â€ said the pilot in bad french.

â€œi am,â€ replied dantÃ¨s, in bad italian, â€œa maltese sailor. we were
coming from syracuse laden with grain. the storm of last night overtook
us at cape morgiou, and we were wrecked on these rocks.â€

â€œwhere do you come from?â€

â€œfrom these rocks that i had the good luck to cling to while our captain
and the rest of the crew were all lost. i saw your vessel, and fearful
of being left to perish on the desolate island, i swam off on a piece of
wreckage to try and intercept your course. you have saved my life, and i

subterranean waters filter in their caves. edmond, amazed, wonderstruck,
filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight,
when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles.
he then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos, but they had
suddenly receded, and now the path became a labyrinth, and then the
entrance vanished, and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and
mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of ali baba to the
arabian fisherman. all was useless, the treasure disappeared, and had
again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry
it off.

the day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had
been, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and dantÃ¨s was
then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and
unsettled in his brain. night came, and with it the preparation for
departure, and these preparations served to conceal dantÃ¨sâ€™

catastrophe, which he could not foresee would have been so complete.
this solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man
desirous of burying treasure. only, might not these betraying marks have
attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made? and had the
dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret?


it seemed, however, to edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the
inequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the
marks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto. a large round rock,
placed solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to
lead. edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of
the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore turned
round and retraced his steps.

meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast, had got some water from
a spring, spread out the fruit and bread, and cooked

was about to round the island of corsica. this sight reassured him. he
then looked at the objects near him. he saw that he was on the highest
point of the island,--a statue on this vast pedestal of granite, nothing
human appearing in sight, while the blue ocean beat against the base of
the island, and covered it with a fringe of foam. then he descended with
cautious and slow step, for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that
he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality.

dantÃ¨s, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he
had noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the
bath of some ancient nymph. this creek was sufficiently wide at its
mouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small
vessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from
observation.

then following the clew that, in the hands of the abbÃ© faria, had been
so skilfully used to guide him through the dÃ¦dalian labyrinth of

he must dig. but by some strange play of
emotion, in proportion as the proofs that faria, had not been deceived
became stronger, so did his heart give way, and a feeling of
discouragement stole over him. this last proof, instead of giving him
fresh strength, deprived him of it; the pickaxe descended, or rather
fell; he placed it on the ground, passed his hand over his brow, and
remounted the stairs, alleging to himself, as an excuse, a desire to be
assured that no one was watching him, but in reality because he felt
that he was about to faint. the island was deserted, and the sun seemed
to cover it with its fiery glance; afar off, a few small fishing boats
studded the bosom of the blue ocean.

dantÃ¨s had tasted nothing, but he thought not of hunger at such a
moment; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum, and again entered the
cavern. the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy, was now like a feather in
his grasp; he seized it, and attacked the wall. after several blows he
perceived that the

feeding at a little distance. this would have been a favorable occasion
to secure his dinner; but dantÃ¨s feared lest the report of his gun
should attract attention.

he thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at the
fire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast, and descended
with this torch. he wished to see everything. he approached the hole he
had dug, and now, with the aid of the torch, saw that his pickaxe had in
reality struck against iron and wood. he planted his torch in the ground
and resumed his labor. in an instant a space three feet long by two feet
broad was cleared, and dantÃ¨s could see an oaken coffer, bound with cut
steel; in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate, which
was still untarnished, the arms of the spada family--viz., a sword, _en
pale_, on an oval shield, like all the italian armorial bearings, and
surmounted by a cardinalâ€™s hat; dantÃ¨s easily recognized them, faria

ses from leaving him, and then rushed madly about the rocks of
monte cristo, terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea-fowls with
his wild cries and gestures; then he returned, and, still unable to
believe the evidence of his senses, rushed into the grotto, and found
himself before this mine of gold and jewels. this time he fell on his
knees, and, clasping his hands convulsively, uttered a prayer
intelligible to god alone. he soon became calmer and more happy, for
only now did he begin to realize his felicity. he then set himself to
work to count his fortune. there were a thousand ingots of gold, each
weighing from two to three pounds; then he piled up twenty-five thousand
crowns, each worth about eighty francs of our money, and bearing the
effigies of alexander vi. and his predecessors; and he saw that the
complement was not half empty. and he measured ten double handfuls of
pearls, diamonds, and other gems, many of which, mounted by the most
famous workmen, were valuable beyond thei

 since he went away; his treasure
was just as he had left it. early on the following morning he commenced
the removal of his riches, and ere nightfall the whole of his immense
wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker.

a week passed by. dantÃ¨s employed it in manÅ“uvring his yacht round the
island, studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined
for some important service, till at the end of that time he was
perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities. the former dantÃ¨s
proposed to augment, the latter to remedy.

upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail
approaching monte cristo. as it drew near, he recognized it as the boat
he had given to jacopo. he immediately signalled it. his signal was
returned, and in two hours afterwards the new-comer lay at anchor beside
the yacht. a mournful answer awaited each of edmondâ€™s eager inquiries as
to the information jacopo had obtained. old dantÃ¨s was dead, and

the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching
gaze--there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar
scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the
countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at
his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he deemed
it as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said, speaking
with a strong italian accent, â€œyou are, i presume, m. caderousse?â€

â€œyes, sir,â€ answered the host, even more surprised at the question than
he had been by the silence which had preceded it; â€œi am gaspard
caderousse, at your service.â€

â€œgaspard caderousse,â€ rejoined the priest. â€œyes,--christian and surname
are the same. you formerly lived, i believe in the allÃ©es de meillan, on
the fourth floor?â€


â€œi did.â€

â€œand you followed the business of a tailor?â€

the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish
scrutiny.

â€œyou remind me,â€ said the priest, â€œthat the young man concerning whom i
asked you was said to bear the name of edmond.â€

â€œsaid to bear the name!â€ repeated caderousse, becoming excited and
eager. â€œwhy, he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation
of gaspard caderousse; but tell me, i pray, what has become of poor
edmond? did you know him? is he alive and at liberty? is he prosperous
and happy?â€

â€œhe died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the
felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon.â€

a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse, who
turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with
the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.

â€œpoor fellow, poor fellow!â€ murmured caderousse. â€œwell, there, sir, is

poor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been persuaded to tell
all they know, the promises and assurances of safety are quickly
forgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold
trouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the
unfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions
come.â€

â€œnay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, i beg of you.
whatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my
instrumentality, that i solemnly promise you.â€

la carconte muttered a few inarticulate words, then let her head again
drop upon her knees, and went into a fit of ague, leaving the two
speakers to resume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to
hear every word they uttered. again the abbÃ© had been obliged to swallow
a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower
him. when he had sufficiently recovered himself, he said, â€œit appears,
then, that the miserable old man you we

only laid the tips of their fingers on me, i should break to pieces like
glass.â€

â€œmake yourself easy, my friend,â€ replied the abbÃ©. â€œi am a priest, and
confessions die in my breast. recollect, our only desire is to carry
out, in a fitting manner, the last wishes of our friend. speak, then,
without reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth; i
do not know, never may know, the persons of whom you are about to speak;
besides, i am an italian, and not a frenchman, and belong to god, and
not to man, and i shall shortly retire to my convent, which i have only
quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man.â€ this positive
assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage.

â€œwell, then, under these circumstances,â€ said caderousse, â€œi will, i
even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor
edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable.â€

you, he came to see dantÃ¨sâ€™ father, and offered to receive him in his
own house; and the night or two before his death, as i have already
said, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the old
manâ€™s debts, and buried him decently; and so edmondâ€™s father died, as he
had lived, without doing harm to anyone. i have the purse still by me--a
large one, made of red silk.â€

â€œand,â€ asked the abbÃ©, â€œis m. morrel still alive?â€

â€œyes,â€ replied caderousse.

â€œin that case,â€ replied the abbÃ©, â€œhe should be rich, happy.â€

caderousse smiled bitterly. â€œyes, happy as myself,â€ said he.

â€œwhat! m. morrel unhappy?â€ exclaimed the abbÃ©.

â€œhe is reduced almost to the last extremity--nay, he is almost at the
point of dishonor.â€

labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of

france with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of the
general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was a
captain in 1823, during the spanish war--that is to say, at the time
when danglars made his early speculations. fernand was a spaniard, and
being sent to spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen,
found danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the
support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received
promises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths
known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by
the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief
campaign that, after the taking of trocadero, he was made colonel, and
received the title of count and the cross of an officer of the legion of
honor.â€

begun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards athens--it
was the fashion to pity and support the greeks. the french government,
without protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to
volunteer assistance. fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve
in greece, still having his name kept on the army roll. some time after,
it was stated that the comte de morcerf (this was the name he bore) had
entered the service of ali pasha with the rank of instructor-general.
ali pasha was killed, as you know, but before he died he recompensed the
services of fernand by leaving him a considerable sum, with which he
returned to france, when he was gazetted lieutenant-general.â€

or five vessels, and suffered by three or four bankruptcies; but it is
not for me, although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten
thousand francs, to give any information as to the state of his
finances. ask of me, as mayor, what is my opinion of m. morrel, and i
shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree, and who has up
to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality.
this is all i can say, sir; if you wish to learn more, address yourself
to m. de boville, the inspector of prisons, no. 15, rue de nouailles; he
has, i believe, two hundred thousand francs in morrelâ€™s hands, and if
there be any grounds for apprehension, as this is a greater amount than
mine, you will most probably find him better informed than myself.â€

notes, which might have been twice the sum m. de boville feared to lose.
a ray of joy passed across m. de bovilleâ€™s countenance, yet he made an
effort at self-control, and said,--â€œsir, i ought to tell you that, in
all probability, you will not realize six per cent of this sum.â€


â€œthatâ€™s no affair of mine,â€ replied the englishman, â€œthat is the affair
of the house of thomson & french, in whose name i act. they have,
perhaps, some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm. but
all i know, sir, is, that i am ready to hand you over this sum in

â€œprecisely.â€


â€œbut some official document was drawn up as to this affair, i suppose?â€
 inquired the englishman.

â€œyes, yes, the mortuary deposition. you understand, dantÃ¨sâ€™ relations,
if he had any, might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or
alive.â€

â€œso that now, if there were anything to inherit from him, they may do so
with easy conscience. he is dead, and no mistake about it.â€

â€œoh, yes; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please.â€

meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 10th of the present
month, and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next
month to m. de boville, m. morrel had, in reality, no hope but the
return of the _pharaon_, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel
which had weighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived
in harbor. but this vessel which, like the _pharaon_, came from
calcutta, had been in for a fortnight, while no intelligence had been
received of the _pharaon_.

by this examination, â€œyou wish to speak to me?â€

â€œyes, monsieur; you are aware from whom i come?â€

â€œthe house of thomson & french; at least, so my cashier tells me.â€

â€œhe has told you rightly. the house of thomson & french had 300,000 or
400,000 francs to pay this month in france; and, knowing your strict
punctuality, have collected all the bills bearing your signature, and
charged me as they became due to present them, and to employ the money
otherwise.â€ morrel sighed deeply, and passed his hand over his forehead,
which was covered with perspiration.

â€œso then, sir,â€ said morrel, â€œyou hold bills of mine?â€

â€œyes, and for a considerable sum.â€

firm.

father, who had himself conducted it for five and thirty years--never
has anything bearing the signature of morrel & son been dishonored.â€

â€œi know that,â€ replied the englishman. â€œbut as a man of honor should
answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same
punctuality?â€ morrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who spoke with
more assurance than he had hitherto shown. â€œto questions frankly put,â€
 said he, â€œa straightforward answer should be given. yes, i shall pay,
if, as i hope, my vessel arrives safely; for its arrival will again
procure me the credit which the numerous accidents, of which i have been
the victim, have deprived me; but if the _pharaon_ should be lost, and
this last resource be gone----â€

if he had just quitted marseilles the previous evening, and had just

â€œgood-day, penelon,â€ returned morrel, who could not refrain from smiling

with the phlegm peculiar to his nation; and morrel, overwhelming him
with grateful blessings, conducted him to the staircase. the stranger
met julie on the stairs; she pretended to be descending, but in reality

whether through envy or stupidity, all morrelâ€™s correspondents did not
take this view; and some even came to a contrary decision. the bills
signed by morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous
exactitude, and, thanks to the delay granted by the englishman, were
paid by cocles with equal punctuality. cocles thus remained in his
accustomed tranquillity. it was morrel alone who remembered with alarm,
that if he had to repay on the 15th the 50,000 francs of m. de boville,
and on the 30th the 32,500 francs of bills, for which, as well as the
debt due to the inspector of prisons, he had time granted, he must be a

â€œand what are these corsican bandits doing here with spanish smugglers?â€

â€œalas,â€ returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity,
â€œwe ought always to help one another. very often the bandits are hard
pressed by gendarmes or carbineers; well, they see a vessel, and good
fellows like us on board, they come and demand hospitality of us; you
canâ€™t refuse help to a poor hunted devil; we receive them, and for
greater security we stand out to sea. this costs us nothing, and saves

we can land our goods without interruption.â€

â€œhow so?â€

â€œwhat do you mean by having made a stiff?--having assassinated a man?â€
 said franz, continuing his investigation.

â€œi mean that they have killed an enemy, which is a very different
thing,â€ returned the captain.

â€œwell,â€ said the young man, â€œlet us demand hospitality of these
smugglers and bandits. do you think they will grant it?â€

â€œwithout doubt.â€

â€œhow many are they?â€

 it was a grave one. he was alone in the darkness with
sailors whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to
him; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who
had often examined his weapons,--which were very beautiful,--if not with
envy, at least with curiosity. on the other hand, he was about to land,
without any other escort than these men, on an island which had, indeed,
a very religious name, but which did not seem to franz likely to afford
him much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits. the history
of the scuttled vessels, which had appeared improbable during the day,
seemed very probable at night; placed as he was between two possible
sources of danger, he kept his eye on the crew, and his gun in his hand.
the sailors had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more
cleaving the waves. through the darkness franz, whose eyes were now more
accustomed to it, could see the looming shore along which the boat was
sailing, and then, as the

disappeared among the rocks. not a word was spoken, everyone seemed
occupied, franz with his disembarkment, the sailors with their sails,
the smugglers with their goat; but in the midst of all this carelessness
it was evident that they mutually observed each other. the man who had
disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he
had left; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel, who, turning to
the boat, said, â€œ_sâ€™accommodi_.â€ the italian _sâ€™accommodi_ is
untranslatable; it means at once, â€œcome, enter, you are welcome; make
yourself at home; you are the master.â€ it is like that turkish phrase of
moliÃ¨reâ€™s that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of
things implied in its utterance. the sailors did not wait for a second
invitation; four strokes of the oar brought them to land; gaetano sprang
to shore, exchanged a few words with the sentinel, then his comrades
disembarked, and lastly came franz. one of hi

gaetano, who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a
supper when they had in their boat, bread, wine, half a dozen
partridges, and a good fire to roast them by. â€œbesides,â€ added he, â€œif
the smell of their roast meat tempts you, i will go and offer them two
of our birds for a slice.â€

â€œyou are a born diplomat,â€ returned franz; â€œgo and try.â€

meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which
they made a fire. franz waited impatiently, inhaling the aroma of the
roasted meat, when the captain returned with a mysterious air.

â€œwell,â€ said franz, â€œanything new?--do they refuse?â€

â€œon the contrary,â€ returned gaetano, â€œthe chief, who was told you were a
young frenchman, invites you to sup with him.â€

â€œwell,â€ observed franz, â€œthis chief is very polite, and i see no
objection--the more so as i bring my share of the supper.â€

â€œoh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he
makes one condition,

say is trueâ€--he stopped to see if anyone was near.

â€œwhat do they say?â€

â€œthat this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is
nothing.â€

â€œwhat nonsense!â€ said franz, reseating himself.

â€œit is no nonsense; it is quite true. cama, the pilot of the _saint
ferdinand_, went in once, and he came back amazed, vowing that such
treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales.â€

â€œdo you know,â€ observed franz, â€œthat with such stories you make me think
of ali babaâ€™s enchanted cavern?â€

â€œi tell you what i have been told.â€

â€œthen you advise me to accept?â€

â€œoh, i donâ€™t say that; your excellency will do as you please; i should
be sorry to advise you in the matter.â€

franz pondered the matter for a few moments, concluded that a man so
rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he
had, and seeing only the prospect of a good supper, accepted. gaetano
departed with the reply. franz was prudent, and wished to learn

ke no apologies. i have
always observed that they bandage peopleâ€™s eyes who penetrate enchanted
palaces, for instance, those of raoul in the _huguenots_, and really i
have nothing to complain of, for what i see makes me think of the
wonders of the _arabian nights_.â€


â€œalas! i may say with lucullus, if i could have anticipated the honor of
your visit, i would have prepared for it. but such as is my hermitage,
it is at your disposal; such as is my supper, it is yours to share, if
you will. ali, is the supper ready?â€

at this moment the tapestry moved aside, and a nubian, black as ebony,
and dressed in a plain white tunic, made a sign to his master that all
was prepared in the dining-room.

â€œnow,â€ said the unknown to franz, â€œi do not know if you are of my
opinion, but i think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or
three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to
address one another. pray observe, that i too much respect the laws of
hospitality to ask

 pomegranates from malaga, oranges from
the balearic isles, peaches from france, and dates from tunis. the
supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds;
a boarâ€™s ham with jelly, a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce, a
glorious turbot, and a gigantic lobster. between these large dishes were
smaller ones containing various dainties. the dishes were of silver, and
the plates of japanese china.

franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a
dream. ali alone was present to wait at table, and acquitted himself so
admirably, that the guest complimented his host thereupon.

â€œyes,â€ replied he, while he did the honors of the supper with much ease
and grace--â€œyes, he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me, and does
all he can to prove it. he remembers that i saved his life, and as he
has a regard for his head, he feels some gratitude towards me for having
kept it on his shoulders.â€ ali approached his master, took his hand, and
kissed it.

â€œoh, they are simple enough,â€ replied the host. â€œit seems the fellow had
been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than
etiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned by the bey
to have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the tongue
the first day, the hand the second, and the head the third. i always had
a desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his tongue
was cut out, i went to the bey, and proposed to give him for ali a
splendid double-barreled gun, which i knew he was very desirous of
having. he hesitated a moment, he was so very desirous to complete the
poor devilâ€™s punishment. but when i added to the gun an english cutlass
with which i had shivered his highnessâ€™s yataghan to pieces, the bey
yielded, and agreed to forgive the hand and head, but on condition that
the poor fellow never again set foot in tunis. this was a useless clause
in the bargain, for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the

 the first time you ever took that journey?â€

â€œyes; it will. i must seem to you by no means curious, but i assure you
that it is not my fault i have delayed it so long--it will happen one
day or the other.â€


â€œand do you propose to make this journey very shortly?â€

â€œi do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain
arrangements.â€

â€œi should like to be there at the time you come, and i will endeavor to
repay you, as far as lies in my power, for your liberal hospitality
displayed to me at monte cristo.â€

â€œi should avail myself of your offer with pleasure,â€ replied the host,
â€œbut, unfortunately, if i go there, it will be, in all probability,
_incognito_.â€

the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for franz, for the
unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to
which his guest did ample justice. then ali brought on the dessert, or
rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on
the table. betwe

en the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a
silver cover. the care with which ali placed this cup on the table
roused franzâ€™s curiosity. he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish
paste, something like preserved angelica, but which was perfectly
unknown to him. he replaced the lid, as ignorant of what the cup
contained as he was before he had looked at it, and then casting his
eyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment.

â€œyou cannot guess,â€ said he, â€œwhat there is in that small vase, can
you?â€

â€œno, i really cannot.â€

â€œwell, you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the
mountain whence he derived his picturesque name. in this valley were
magnificent gardens planted by hassen-ben-sabah, and in these gardens
isolated pavilions. into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and
there, says marco polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which
transported them to paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs,
ever-ripe fruit, and ever-lovely virgins. what these happy persons took
for reality was but a dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous,
so enthralling, that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave
it to them, and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck
down the designated victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing
that the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of
delights of which the holy herb, now before you, had given them a slight
foretaste.â€

â€œthen,â€ cried franz, â€œit is hashish! i know that--by nam

aid franz, â€œi have a very great inclination to judge for
myself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies.â€

â€œjudge for yourself, signor aladdin--judge, but do not confine yourself
to one trial. like everything else, we must habituate the senses to a
fresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous. there is a struggle
in nature against this divine substance,--in nature which is not made
for joy and clings to pain. nature subdued must yield in the combat, the
dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns supreme, then
the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream. but what changes
occur! it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys
of the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no longer, but
to dream thus forever. when you return to this mundane sphere from your
visionary world, you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a
lapland winter--to quit paradise for earth--heaven for hell! taste the

porter, truffles, and sundry other dainties which you now adore, did you
like them? could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants
with assafÅ“tida, and the chinese eat swallowsâ€™ nests? eh? no! well, it
is the same with hashish; only eat for a week, and nothing in the world
will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor, which now appears
to you flat and distasteful. let us now go into the adjoining chamber,
which is your apartment, and ali will bring us coffee and pipes.â€

they both arose, and while he who called himself sinbad--and whom we
have occasionally named so, that we might, like his guest, have some
title by which to distinguish him--gave some orders to the servant,
franz entered still another apartment.

it was simply yet richly furnished. it was round, and a large divan
completely encircled it. divan, walls, ceiling, floor, were all covered
with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets; there
were h

appeared to dante; bear-skins from siberia, fox-skins from norway, and
so on; and all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other, so
that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf, or reclining on
the most luxurious bed.

both laid themselves down on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes
and amber mouthpieces were within reach, and all prepared so that there
was no need to smoke the same pipe twice. each of them took one, which
ali lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee.

there was a momentâ€™s silence, during which sinbad gave himself up to
thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly, even in the midst of his
conversation; and franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie, into
which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco, which seems to
remove with its fume all the troubles of the mind, and to give the
smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul. ali brought in the
coffee.

â€œhow do you take it?â€

â€œ_ma foi_,â€ said franz, â€œit would be the easiest thing in the world; for
i feel eagleâ€™s wings springing out at my shoulders, and with those wings
i could make a tour of the world in four and twenty hours.â€

â€œah, yes, the hashish is beginning its work. well, unfurl your wings,
and fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing, there is a watch over
you; and if your wings, like those of icarus, melt before the sun, we
are here to ease your fall.â€ he then said something in arabic to ali,
who made a sign of obedience and withdrew, but not to any distance.

as to franz a strange transformation had taken place in him. all the
bodily fatigue of the day, all the preoccupation of mind which the
events of the evening had brought on, disappeared as they do at the
first approach of sleep, when we are still sufficiently conscious to be
aware of the coming of slumber. his body seemed to acquire an airy
lightness, his perception brightened in a remarkable manner, his senses
seemed to redo

waves, but as an oasis in the
desert; then, as his boat drew nearer, the songs became louder, for an
enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven, as if some loreley had
decreed to attract a soul thither, or amphion, the enchanter, intended
there to build a city.

at length the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without shock,
as lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains
of most delicious melody. he descended, or rather seemed to descend,
several steps, inhaling the fresh and balmy air, like that which may be
supposed to reign around the grotto of circe, formed from such perfumes
as set the mind a-dreaming, and such fires as burn the very senses; and
he saw again all he had seen before his sleep, from sinbad, his singular
host, to ali, the mute attendant; then all seemed to fade away and
become confused before his eyes, like the last shadows of the magic
lantern before it is extinguished, and he was again in the chamber of
statues, lighted only by on

in the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure.

they were the same statues, rich in form, in attraction, and poesy, with
eyes of fascination, smiles of love, and bright and flowing hair. they
were phryne, cleopatra, messalina, those three celebrated courtesans.
then among them glided like a pure ray, like a christian angel in the
midst of olympus, one of those chaste figures, those calm shadows, those
soft visions, which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble
wantons.

then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love, and
approached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in
their long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves,
and assuming attitudes which th

thought himself in a sepulchre, into which a ray of sunlight in pity
scarcely penetrated. he stretched forth his hand, and touched stone; he
rose to his seat, and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of
dry heather, very soft and odoriferous. the vision had fled; and as if
the statues had been but shadows from the tomb, they had vanished at his
waking.

he advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came, and
to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality. he
found that he was in a grotto, went towards the opening, and through a
kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky. the air and water were
shining in the beams of the morning sun; on the shore the sailors were
sitting, chatting and laughing; and at ten yards from them the boat was
at anchor, undulating gracefully on the water.

there for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his
brow, and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left

sunshine more vividly than ever.

he went gayly up to the sailors, who rose as soon as they perceived him;
and the patron, accosting him, said, â€œthe signor sinbad has left his
compliments for your excellency, and desires us to express the regret he
feels at not being able to take his leave in person; but he trusts you
will excuse him, as very important business calls him to malaga.â€

â€œso, then, gaetano,â€ said franz, â€œthis is, then, all reality; there
exists a man who has received me in this island, entertained me right
royally, and has departed while i was asleep?â€

â€œhe exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her
sails spread; and if you will use your glass, you will, in all
probability, recognize your host in the midst of his crew.â€

so saying, gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was
making sail towards the southern point of corsica. franz adjusted his
telescope, and directed it to

â€œnow go,â€ returned franz, â€œor i shall go myself and bargain with your
_affettatore_, who is mine also; he is an old friend of mine, who has
plundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope of making more out of
me, he will take a less price than the one i offer you; you will lose
the preference, and that will be your fault.â€

â€œdo not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,â€ returned signor
pastrini, with the smile peculiar to the italian speculator when he
confesses defeat; â€œi will do all i can, and i hope you will be
satisfied.â€

â€œand now we understand each other.â€

â€œwhen do you wish the carriage to be here?â€

â€œin an hour.â€

â€œin an hour it will be at the door.â€

an hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance
which was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the
occasion, but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would have
thought themselves happy to have secu

the carnival. â€œexcellency,â€ cried the _cicerone_, seeing franz approach
the window, â€œshall i bring the carriage nearer to the palace?â€

accustomed as franz was to the italian phraseology, his first impulse
was to look round him, but these words were addressed to him. franz was
the â€œexcellency,â€ the vehicle was the â€œcarriage,â€ and the hÃ´tel de
londres was the â€œpalace.â€ the genius for laudation characteristic of the
race was in that phrase.

franz and albert descended, the carriage approached the palace; their

giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters.
thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their conversations, vampa
saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an army, or governor of
a province. teresa saw herself rich, superbly attired, and attended by a
train of liveried domestics. then, when they had thus passed the day in
building castles in the air, they separated their flocks, and descended
from the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble
position.

â€œone day the young shepherd told the countâ€™s steward that he had seen a
wolf come out of the sabine mountains, and prowl around his flock. the
steward gave him a gun; this was what vampa longed for. this gun had an
excellent barrel, made at brescia, and carrying a ball with the
precision of an english rifle; but one day the count broke the stock,
and had then cast the gun aside. this, however, was nothing to a
sculptor like vampa; he examined the broken stock, c

amasine between sonnino and juperno. he strove to collect a band of
followers, and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone, whom
he hoped to surpass. many young men of palestrina, frascati, and
pampinara had disappeared. their disappearance at first caused much
disquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto. after
some time cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the most
extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of
him.

â€œone day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of
frosinone. the banditâ€™s laws are positive; a young girl belongs first to
him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is
abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. when
their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is sent
to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger;
should the ransom be refused, the prisoner i

carmela was attired like a woman of sonnino. her cap was embroidered
with pearls, the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds, her girdle
was of turkey silk, with large embroidered flowers, her bodice and skirt
were of cashmere, her apron of indian muslin, and the buttons of her
corset were of jewels. two of her companions were dressed, the one as a
woman of nettuno, and the other as a woman of la riccia. four young men
of the richest and noblest families of rome accompanied them with that
italian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the
world. they were attired as peasants of albano, velletri, civita-
castellana, and sora. we need hardly add that these peasant costumes,
like those of the young women, were brilliant with gold and jewels.

â€œcarmela wished to form a quadrille, but there was one lady wanting.
carmela looked all around her, but not one of the guests had a costume
similar to her own, or those of her companions. the count of san-felice

ival time?â€™--carmela turned
towards the young man who was talking with her, and saying a few words
to him, pointed with her finger to teresa. the young man looked, bowed
in obedience, and then went to teresa, and invited her to dance in a
quadrille directed by the countâ€™s daughter. teresa felt a flush pass
over her face; she looked at luigi, who could not refuse his assent.
luigi slowly relinquished teresaâ€™s arm, which he had held beneath his
own, and teresa, accompanied by her elegant cavalier, took her appointed
place with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille. certainly, in
the eyes of an artist, the exact and strict costume of teresa had a very
different character from that of carmela and her companions; and teresa
was frivolous and coquettish, and thus the embroidery and muslins, the
cashmere waist-girdles, all dazzled her, and the reflection of sapphires
and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain.

â€œluigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind. it was
l

ike an acute pain which gnawed at his heart, and then thrilled through
his whole body. he followed with his eye each movement of teresa and her
cavalier; when their hands touched, he felt as though he should swoon;
every pulse beat with violence, and it seemed as though a bell were
ringing in his ears. when they spoke, although teresa listened timidly
and with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier, as luigi
could read in the ardent looks of the good-looking young man that his
language was that of praise, it seemed as if the whole world was turning
round with him, and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears
ideas of murder and assassination. then fearing that his paroxysm might
get the better of him, he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree
against which he was leaning, and with the other convulsively grasped
the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt, and wh

â€œthe young peasant girl, at first timid and scared, soon recovered
herself. we have said that teresa was handsome, but this is not all;
teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more
potent than our affected and studied elegancies. she had almost all the
honors of the quadrille, and if she were envious of the count of san-
feliceâ€™s daughter, we will not undertake to say that carmela was not
jealous of her. and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier
led her back to the place whence he had taken her, and where luigi
awaited her. twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced
at luigi, and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features
were agitated, once even the blade of his knife, half drawn from its
sheath, had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare. thus, it was
almost tremblingly that she resumed her loverâ€™s arm. the quadrille had

besought his daughter so earnestly, that she acceded. one of the
cavaliers then hastened to invite teresa, without whom it was impossible
for the quadrille to be formed, but the young girl had disappeared. the
truth was, that luigi had not felt the strength to support another such
trial, and, half by persuasion and half by force, he had removed teresa
toward another part of the garden. teresa had yielded in spite of
herself, but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young
man, she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something

night had driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of the
villa were closed on them for the _festa_ in-doors, he took teresa quite
away, and as he left her at her home, he said,

â€œâ€˜teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young
countess of san-felice?â€™

â€œâ€˜i thought,â€™ replied the young girl, with all the frankness of her
nature, â€˜that i would give half my life for a costume such as she wore.â€™

â€œâ€˜and what said your cavalier to you?â€™

â€œâ€˜he said it only depended on myself to have it, and i had only one word
to say.â€™

â€œâ€˜he was right,â€™ said luigi. â€˜do you desire it as ardently as you say?â€™

â€œâ€˜yes.â€™

â€œâ€˜well, then, you shall have it!â€™

â€œthe young girl, much astonished, raised her head to look at him, but
his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips. as
luigi spoke thus, he left her. teresa followed him with her eyes into

but however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these
reflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark
frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum, through the various openings
of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly
gleam from the eyes of the wandering dead. the carriage stopped near the
meta sudans; the door was opened, and the young men, eagerly alighting,
found themselves opposite a _cicerone_, who appeared to have sprung up
from the ground, so unexpected was his appearance.

the usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two
conductors, nor is it possible, at rome, to avoid this abundant supply
of guides; besides the ordinary _cicerone_, who seizes upon you directly
you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you remain in the

neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to be played
that night at the teatro argentina, and also what performers appeared in
it.

the opera of _parisina_ was announced for representation, and the
principal actors were coselli, moriani, and la specchia. the young men,
therefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the
opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of _lucia
di lammermoor_, supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of
italy. albert had never been able to endure the italian theatres, with
their orchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of
balconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who
had had his stall at the bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the

effective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his
elegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy

of the carnival?

these united considerations made albert more lively and anxious to
please than he had hitherto been. totally disregarding the business of
the stage, he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the
beauty of each pretty woman, aided by a powerful opera-glass; but, alas,
this attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosity had
been excited, and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures,
into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing, were all so much
engrossed with themselves, their lovers, or their own thoughts, that
they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass.

the truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the carnival, with the
â€œholy weekâ€ that was to succeed it, so filled every fair breast, as to
prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the
stage. the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought
of; at certain conventional moments, the spectator

nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of
intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms
they seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between
ourselves and the countess--nothing more.â€

â€œis there, indeed, my good fellow? pray tell me, is it sympathy of
heart?â€

â€œno; of taste,â€ continued franz gravely.

â€œand in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?â€

â€œby the countessâ€™s visiting the colosseum, as we did last night, by
moonlight, and nearly alone.â€

â€œyou were with her, then?â€

â€œi was.â€

â€œand what did you say to her?â€

â€œoh, we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is
a glorious monument!â€

â€œupon my word,â€ cried albert, â€œyou must have been a very entertaining
companion alone, or all but alone, with a beautiful woman in such a
place of sentiment as the colosseum, and

â€œwhat a confounded long time this first act lasts. i believe, on my
soul, that they never mean to finish it.â€

â€œoh, yes, they will; only listen to that charming finale. how
exquisitely coselli sings his part.â€

â€œbut what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.â€

â€œwell, then, what do you say to la specchia? did you ever see anything
more perfect than her acting?â€

â€œwhy, you know, my dear fellow, when one has been accustomed to malibran
and sontag, such singers as these donâ€™t make the same impression on you
they perhaps do on others.â€

â€œat least, you must admire morianiâ€™s style and execution.â€

â€œi never fancied men of his dark, ponderous appearance singing with a
voice like a womanâ€™s.â€

â€œmy good friend,â€ said franz, turning to him, while albert continued to
point his glass at every box in the theatre, â€œyou seem determined not to
approve; you are really too difficult to please.â€ the curtain at length

eager impatience, but began at once the tour of the house, closely
followed by albert, who availed himself of the few minutes required to
reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and
smoothness of his collar, and to arrange the lappets of his coat. this
important task was just completed as they arrived at the countessâ€™s box.
at the knock, the door was immediately opened, and the young man who was
seated beside the countess, in obedience to the italian custom,
instantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers, who, in turn,
would be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors.

franz presented albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the
day, both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents;
nor did he say more than the truth, for in paris and the circle in which
the viscount moved, he was looked upon and cited as a model of
perfection. franz added that his companion, deeply grieved at having

â€œand what do you think of her personal appearance?â€

â€œoh, i consider her perfectly lovely--she is just my idea of what medora
must have been.â€

franz and the countess exchanged a smile, and then the latter resumed
her conversation with albert, while franz returned to his previous
survey of the house and company. the curtain rose on the ballet, which
was one of those excellent specimens of the italian school, admirably
arranged and put on the stage by henri, who has established for himself
a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the
choreographic art--one of those masterly productions of grace, method,
and elegance in which the whole _corps de ballet_, from the principal
dancers to the humblest supernumerary, are all engaged on the stage at
the same time; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting
the same attitude, or elevating the same arm or leg with a

begged to know what had happened.

â€œcountess,â€ returned franz, totally unheeding her raillery, â€œi asked you
a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian
lady opposite; i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her
husband?â€

â€œnay,â€ answered the countess, â€œi know no more of him than yourself.â€

â€œperhaps you never before noticed him?â€

â€œwhat a question--so truly french! do you not know that we italians have
eyes only for the man we love?â€

â€œtrue,â€ replied franz.

â€œall i can say is,â€ continued the countess, taking up the _lorgnette_,
and directing it toward the box in question, â€œthat the gentleman, whose
history i am unable to furnish, seems to me as though he had just been
dug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave-
digger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours,
than anything human. how ghastly pale he is!â€

â€œoh, he is always

merely amusing herself at his expense, or whether her
fears and agitations were genuine.

upon his return to the hotel, franz found albert in his dressing-gown
and slippers, listlessly extended on a sofa, smoking a cigar. â€œmy dear
fellow.â€ cried he, springing up, â€œis it really you? why, i did not
expect to see you before tomorrow.â€

â€œmy dear albert,â€ replied franz, â€œi am glad of this opportunity to tell
you, once and forever, that you entertain a most erroneous notion
concerning italian women. i should have thought the continual failures
you have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you
better by this time.â€

â€œupon my soul, these women would puzzle the very devil to read them
aright. why, here--they give you their hand--they press yours in return-
-they keep up a whispering conversation--permit you to accompany them
home. why, if a parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these marks of
flattering attention, her reputation would be gone forever.â€

is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent and
distinguished breeding.â€ franz smiled; for he well remembered that
albert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his
own complexion.

â€œwell, that tends to confirm my own ideas,â€ said franz, â€œthat the
countessâ€™s suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason. did he
speak in your hearing? and did you catch any of his words?â€

â€œi did; but they were uttered in the romaic dialect. i knew that from
the mixture of greek words. i donâ€™t know whether i ever told you that
when i was at college i was rather--rather strong in greek.â€

â€œhe spoke the romaic language, did he?â€

â€œi think so.â€

â€œthat settles it,â€ murmured franz. â€œâ€˜tis he, past all doubt.â€

â€œwhat do you say?â€

â€œnothing, nothing. but tell me, wha

ished at this strange theory.

â€œoh, yes,â€ replied the count; â€œunderstand me, i would fight a duel for a
trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so that, thanks to my
skill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to danger i have
gradually acquired, i should be almost certain to kill my man. oh, i
would fight for such a cause; but in return for a slow, profound,
eternal torture, i would give back the same, were it possible; an eye
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, as the orientalists say,--our masters
in everything,--those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a
life of dreams and a paradise of realities.â€

â€œbut,â€ said franz to the count, â€œwith this theory, which renders you at
once judge and executioner of your own cause, it would be difficult to
adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power
of the law. hatred is blind, rage carries you away; and he who pours out
vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught.â€

whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to
him, whether the explanation of the count of monte cristo with regard to
duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which franz knew of
had had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his companion did
not pay the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate like a man who
for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of
italian cookery--that is, the worst in the world. as for the count, he
just touched the dishes; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by
sitting down with his guests, and awaited their departure to be served
with some strange or more delicate food. this brought back to franz, in
spite of himself, the recollection of the terror with which the count
had inspired the countess g----, and her firm conviction that the man in
the opposite box was a vampire. at the end of the breakfast franz took
out his

provincial. the first opportunity you have, undeceive him, i beg, and
tell him i am nothing of the kind.â€ franz smiled; an instant after the
count entered.

â€œi am now quite at your service, gentlemen,â€ said he. â€œthe carriage is
going one way to the piazza del popolo, and we will go another; and, if
you please, by the corso. take some more of these cigars, m. de

â€œwith all my heart,â€ returned albert; â€œitalian cigars are horrible. when
you come to paris, i will return all this.â€

â€œi will not refuse; i intend going there soon, and since you allow me, i
will pay you a visit. come, we have not any time to lose, it is half-
past twelve--let us set off.â€ all three descended; the coachman received
his masterâ€™s orders, and drove down the via del babuino. while the three
gentlemen walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina, which
led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces, franz

much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now
beheld.

as for the count of monte cristo, he had never for an instant shown any
appearance of having been moved. imagine the large and splendid corso,
bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces, with their
balconies hung with carpets, and their windows with flags. at these
balconies are three hundred thousand spectators--romans, italians,
strangers from all parts of the world, the united aristocracy of birth,
wealth, and genius. lovely women, yielding to the influence of the
scene, bend over their balconies, or lean from their windows, and shower
down confetti, which are returned by bouquets; the air seems darkened
with the falling confetti and flying flowers. in the streets the lively
crowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes--gigantic cabbages walk
gravely about, buffaloesâ€™ heads bellow from menâ€™s shoulders, dogs

eek you will not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six
buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a piece for each button.â€

â€œthen i must give up the idea?â€

â€œno; we have them ready-made. leave all to me; and tomorrow, when you
awake, you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be
satisfied.â€

â€œmy dear albert,â€ said franz, â€œleave all to our host; he has already
proved himself full of resources; let us dine quietly, and afterwards go
and see _lâ€™italienne Ã  alger!_

â€œagreed,â€ returned albert; â€œbut remember, signor pastrini, that both my
friend and myself attach the greatest importance to having tomorrow the
costumes we have asked for.â€

the host again assured them they might rely on him, and that their
wishes should be attended to; upon which franz and albert mounted to
their apartments, and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their
costumes. albert, as he took off his dress, carefully preserved the
bunch of violets; it was his t

themselves in the countâ€™s box. during the first act, the countess g----
entered. her first look was at the box where she had seen the count the
previous evening, so that she perceived franz and albert in the place of
the very person concerning whom she had expressed so strange an opinion
to franz. her opera-glass was so fixedly directed towards them, that
franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity; and, availing
himself of one of the privileges of the spectators of the italian
theatres, who use their boxes to hold receptions, the two friends went
to pay their respects to the countess. scarcely had they entered, when
she motioned to franz to assume the seat of honor. albert, in his turn,
sat behind.

â€œwell,â€ said she, hardly giving franz time to sit down, â€œit seems you
have nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new lord
ruthven, and you are already the best friends in the world.â€

â€œwithout being so far advanced as that, my dear countes

â€œwell, did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask, and one with
white damask with a red cross? those were the countâ€™s windows.â€

â€œwhy, he must be a nabob. do you know what those three windows were
worth?â€

â€œtwo or three hundred roman crowns?â€

â€œtwo or three thousand.â€

â€œthe deuce.â€

â€œdoes his island produce him such a revenue?â€

â€œit does not bring him a baiocco.â€

â€œthen why did he purchase it?â€

â€œfor a whim.â€

â€œhe is an original, then?â€

â€œin reality,â€ observed albert, â€œhe seemed to me somewhat eccentric; were
he at paris, and a frequenter of the theatres, i should say he was a
poor devil literally mad. this morning he made two or three exits worthy
of didier or anthony.â€

at this moment a fresh visitor entered, and, according to custom, franz
gave up his seat to him. this circumstance had, moreover, the effect of
changing the conversation; an hour afterwards the two friends returned
to their hotel.

signor pastrini had already set

about procuring their disguises for the
morrow; and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied. the
next morning, at nine oâ€™clock, he entered franzâ€™s room, followed by a
tailor, who had eight or ten roman peasant costumes on his arm; they
selected two exactly alike, and charged the tailor to sew on each of
their hats about twenty yards of ribbon, and to procure them two of the
long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower orders
decorate themselves on fÃªte days.

albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress--a jacket and
breeches of blue velvet, silk stockings with clocks, shoes with buckles,
and a silk waistcoat. this picturesque attire set him off to great
advantage; and when he had bound the scarf around his waist, and when

â€œwhether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same,â€ returned
albert. â€œyou have read the letter?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œyou know how imperfectly the women of the _mezzo cito_ are educated in
italy?â€ (this is the name of the lower class.)

â€œyes.â€

â€œwell, read the letter again. look at the writing, and find if you can,

reality, charming, and the orthography irreproachable.) â€œyou are born to
good fortune,â€ said franz, as he returned the letter.

â€œlaugh as much as you will,â€ replied albert, â€œi am in love.â€

â€œyou alarm me,â€ cried franz. â€œi see that i shall not only go alone to
the duke of braccianoâ€™s, but also return to florence alone.â€

made some difficulty, alleging
their fear of depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as he was
going to the palli theatre, the box at the argentina theatre would be
lost if they did not profit by it. this assurance determined the two
friends to accept it.

franz had by degrees become accustomed to the countâ€™s pallor, which had
so forcibly struck him at their first meeting. he could not refrain from
admiring the severe beauty of his features, the only defect, or rather
the principal quality of which was the pallor. truly, a byronic hero!
franz could not, we will not say see him, but even think of him without
imagining his stern head upon manfredâ€™s shoulders, or beneath laraâ€™s
helmet. his forehead was marked with the line that indicates the
constant presence of bitter thoughts; he had the fiery eyes that seem to
penetrate to the very soul, and the haughty and disdainful upper lip
that gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses
them on the minds of those

 meeting such
a man. franz was less enthusiastic; but the count exercised over him
also the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less
domineering. he thought several times of the project the count had of
visiting paris; and he had no doubt but that, with his eccentric
character, his characteristic face, and his colossal fortune, he would
produce a great effect there. and yet he did not wish to be at paris
when the count was there.

the evening passed as evenings mostly pass at italian theatres; that is,
not in listening to the music, but in paying visits and conversing. the
countess g---- wished to revive the subject of the count, but franz
announced he had something far newer to tell her, and, in spite of
albertâ€™s demonstrations of false modesty, he informed the countess of
the great event which had preoccupied them for the last three days. as
similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy, if we may credit
travellers, the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity, bu

sday, all those who through
want of money, time, or enthusiasm, have not been to see the carnival
before, mingle in the gayety, and contribute to the noise and
excitement. from two oâ€™clock till five franz and albert followed in the
_fÃªte_, exchanging handfuls of _confetti_ with the other carriages and
the pedestrians, who crowded amongst the horsesâ€™ feet and the carriage
wheels without a single accident, a single dispute, or a single fight.
the _fÃªtes_ are veritable pleasure days to the italians. the author of
this history, who has resided five or six years in italy, does not
recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those
events so common in other countries. albert was triumphant in his
harlequin costume. a knot of rose-colored ribbons fell from his shoulder
almost to the ground. in order that there might be no confusion, franz
wore his peasantâ€™s costume.

as the day advanced, the tumult became greater. there was not on the

its course between its two granite banks.

a new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd. the sellers
of _moccoletti_ entered on the scene. the _moccoli_, or _moccoletti_,
are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight,
and which give to each actor in the great final scene of the carnival
two very serious problems to grapple with,--first, how to keep his own
_moccoletto_ alight; and secondly, how to extinguish the _moccoletti_ of
others. the _moccoletto_ is like life: man has found but one means of
transmitting it, and that one comes from god. but he has discovered a
thousand means of taking it away, and the devil has somewhat aided him.
the _moccoletto_ is kindled by approaching it to a light. but who can
describe the thousand means of extinguishing the _moccoletto_?--the
gigantic bellows, the monstrous extinguishers, the superhuman fans.

â€œit is useless; he would not come up.â€

â€œto your apartments, perhaps; but he will not make any difficulty at

looked on to the street, and whistled in a peculiar manner. the man in
the mantle quitted the wall, and advanced into the middle of the street.
â€œ_salite!_â€ said the count, in the same tone in which he would have
given an order to his servant. the messenger obeyed without the least
hesitation, but rather with alacrity, and, mounting the steps at a
bound, entered the hotel; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of
the room.

â€œah, it is you, peppino,â€ said the count. but peppino, instead of
answering, threw himself on his knees, seized the countâ€™s hand, and
covered it with kisses. â€œah,â€ said the count, â€œyou have, then, not

when i rise, or after my dinner, or in the middle of the night, i

rang, and a footman appeared. â€œorder out the carriage,â€ he said, â€œand
remove the pistols which are in the holsters. you need not awaken the
coachman; ali will drive.â€ in a very short time the noise of wheels was
heard, and the carriage stopped at the door. the count took out his
watch. â€œhalf-past twelve,â€ he said. â€œwe might start at five oâ€™clock and
be in time, but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night,
and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the
hands of the infidels. are you still resolved to accompany me?â€

â€œmore determined than ever.â€

â€œwell, then, come along.â€

franz and the

count went downstairs, accompanied by peppino. at the door
they found the carriage. ali was on the box, in whom franz recognized
the dumb slave of the grotto of monte cristo. franz and the count got
into the carriage. peppino placed himself beside ali, and they set off
at a rapid pace. ali had received his instructions, and went down the
corso, crossed the campo vaccino, went up the strada san gregorio, and
reached the gates of st. sebastian. then the porter raised some
difficulties, but the count of monte cristo produced a permit from the
governor of rome, allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of
the day or night; the portcullis was therefore raised, the porter had a
louis for his trouble, and they went on their way.

the road which the carriage now traversed was t

he ancient appian way,
and bordered with tombs. from time to time, by the light of the moon,
which began to rise, franz imagined that he saw something like a
sentinel appear at various points among the ruins, and suddenly retreat
into the darkness on a signal from peppino.

a short time before they reached the baths of caracalla the carriage
stopped, peppino opened the door, and the count and franz alighted.

â€œin ten minutes,â€ said the count to his companion, â€œwe shall be there.â€

he then took peppino aside, gave him an order in a low voice, and
peppino went away, taking with him a torch, brought with them in the
carriage. five minutes elapsed, during which franz saw the shepherd
going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface
of the campagna; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red
herbage, which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous l

e way in which albert had sustained the national honor in
the presence of the bandit.

â€œmy dear albert,â€ he said, â€œif you will make haste, we shall yet have
time to finish the night at torloniaâ€™s. you may conclude your
interrupted galop, so that you will owe no ill-will to signor luigi, who
has, indeed, throughout this whole affair acted like a gentleman.â€

â€œyou are decidedly right, and we may reach the palazzo by two oâ€™clock.
signor luigi,â€ continued albert, â€œis there any formality to fulfil
before i take leave of your excellency?â€

â€œnone, sir,â€ replied the bandit, â€œyou are as free as air.â€

â€œwell, then, a happy and merry life to you. come, gentlemen, come.â€

and albert, followed by franz and the count, descended the staircase,
crossed the square chamber, where stood all the bandits, hat in hand.

â€œpeppino,â€ said the brigand chief, â€œgive me the torch.â€

â€œwhat are you going to do?â€ inquired the count.

â€œi will show you the way back myself,â€

â€œyes,â€ replied franz, â€œhere i am,â€ and he, in his turn, left the caves.
they advanced to the plain. â€œah, your pardon,â€ said albert, turning
round; â€œwill you allow me, captain?â€ and he lighted his cigar at vampaâ€™s
torch. â€œnow, my dear count,â€ he said, â€œlet us on with all the speed we
may. i am enormously anxious to finish my night at the duke of
braccianoâ€™s.â€ they found the carriage where they had left it. the count
said a word in arabic to ali, and the horses went on at great speed. it
was just two oâ€™clock by albertâ€™s watch when the two friends entered into
the dancing-room. their return was quite an event, but as they entered
together, all uneasiness on albertâ€™s account ceased instantly.

â€œmadame,â€ said the viscount of morcerf, advancing towards the countess,
â€œyesterday you were so condescending as to promise me a galop; i am
rather late in claiming this gracious promise, but here is my friend,

regards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear count, i can only say
that you may command me and mine to any extent you please.â€

â€œthen it is settled,â€ said the count, â€œand i give you my solemn
assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize
plans that i have long meditated.â€ franz did not doubt that these plans
were the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the
grotto of monte cristo, and while the count was speaking the young man
watched him closely, hoping to read something of his purpose in his
face, but his countenance was inscrutable especially when, as in the
present case, it was veiled in a sphinx-like smile. â€œbut tell me now,

ng men, â€œallow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant

with that of the mysterious individual before him, and unconsciously he
shuddered at its touch, for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse.
â€œlet us understand each other,â€ said albert; â€œit is agreed--is it not?--
that you are to be at no. 27, in the rue du helder, on the 21st of may,
at half-past ten in the morning, and your word of honor passed for your
punctuality?â€


â€œthe 21st of may, at half-past ten in the morning, rue du helder, no.
27,â€ replied the count. the young men then rose, and bowing to the
count, quitted the room. â€œwhat is the matter?â€ asked albert of franz,
when they had returned to their own apartments; â€œyou seem more than
commonly thoughtful.â€

â€œi will confess to you, albert,â€ replied franz, â€œthe count is a very
singular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris

â€œwill you promise me not to repeat a single word of what i am about to
tell you?â€

â€œi promise.â€

â€œupon your honor?â€

â€œupon my honor.â€

â€œthen listen to me.â€ franz then related to his friend the history of his
excursion to the island of monte cristo and of his finding a party of
smugglers there, and the two corsican bandits with them. he dwelt with
considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had
received from the count, and the magnificence of his entertainment in
the grotto of the _thousand and one nights_. he recounted, with
circumstantial exactitude, all the particulars of the supper, the
hashish, the statues, the dream, and how, at his awakening, there
remained no proof or trace of all these events, save the small yacht,
seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto-
vecchio. then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the
colosseum, between th

these questions to you?â€

â€œi confess he asked me none.â€

â€œno; he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa, where,
i can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and
unconcern, i did not very particularly care to remain. now, then, franz,
when, for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered, he but asks
me in return to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or
italian nobleman who may pass through paris--merely to introduce him
into society--would you have me refuse? my good fellow, you must have
lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold-blooded
policy.â€ and this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the usual
state of affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective
arguments were all on albertâ€™s side.

â€œwell,â€ said franz with a sigh, â€œdo as you please my dear viscount, for
your arguments are beyond my pow

 means of a small gate, similar to that close to the
_conciergeâ€™s_ door, and which merits a particular description.

it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the
house was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the
well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story. this door was a
mockery to the _concierge_, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was
free, and, like that famous portal in the _arabian nights_, opening at
the â€œ_sesame_â€ of ali baba, it was wont to swing backward at a
cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices
or whitest fingers in the world.

at the end of a long corridor, with which the door communicated, and
which formed the antechamber, was, on the right, albertâ€™s breakfast-
room, looking into the court, and on the left the salon, looking into
the garden. shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows, and hid from
the garden and court these two apartments, the only rooms into which

d single-sticks--for, following the example of the
fashionable young men of the time, albert de morcerf cultivated, with
far more perseverance than music and drawing, the three arts that
complete a dandyâ€™s education, i.e., fencing, boxing, and single-stick;
and it was here that he received grisier, cook, and charles leboucher.

the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old
cabinets, filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases, lucca della
robbia _faÃ¯ence_, and palissy platters; of old armchairs, in which
perhaps had sat henry iv. or sully, louis xiii. or richelieu--for two of
these armchairs, adorned with a carved shield, on which were engraved
the fleur-de-lis of france on an azure field, evidently came from the
louvre, or, at least, some royal residence.

over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs, dyed
beneath persiaâ€™s sun, or woven by the fingers of the women of calcutta
or of chandernagor. what these stuffs did there, it was impo

say; they awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination unknown to
their owner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with their
golden and silky reflections.

in the centre of the room was a roller and blanchet â€œbaby grandâ€ piano
in rosewood, but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its
narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath the weight of the
_chefs-dâ€™Å“uvre_ of beethoven, weber, mozart, haydn, grÃ©try, and porpora.

on the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were swords, daggers,
malay creeses, maces, battle-axes; gilded, damasked, and inlaid suits of
armor; dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds, their flame-colored
wings outspread in motionless flight, and their beaks forever open. this
was albertâ€™s favorite lounging place.

e morning of the appointment, the young man had established
himself in the small salon downstairs. there, on a table, surrounded at
some distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco
known,--from the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai, and
so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico, to latakia,--was
exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond;
beside them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged, according to their
size and quality, puros, regalias, havanas, and manillas; and, in an
open cabinet, a collection of german pipes, of chibouques, with their
amber mouth-pieces ornamented with coral, and of narghiles, with their
long tubes of morocco, awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the
smokers.

albert had himself presided at the arrangement, or, rather, the
symmetrical derangement, which, after coffee, the guests at a breakfast
of modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from
their mouths, and as

compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold
buttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell eye-glass suspended by a
silken thread, and which, by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic
muscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with a half-official air, without
smiling or speaking. â€œgood-morning, lucien, good-morning,â€ said albert;
â€œyour punctuality really alarms me. what do i say? punctuality! you,
whom i expected last, you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the time
fixed was half-past! has the ministry resigned?â€

â€œno, my dear fellow,â€ returned the young man, seating himself on the
divan; â€œreassure yourself; we are tottering always, but we never fall,
and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility,
and then the affairs of the peninsula will completely consolidate us.â€

â€œah, true; you drive don carlos

â€œyes, he has not much to complain of; bourges is the capital of charles

before it had already transpired on the bourse, and m. danglars (i do

as we do) made a million!â€

they have scarcely any. will you be ambassador, albert? i will send you

â€œyou say very true,â€ responded debray.

the count of monte cristo.â€

â€œ_pardieu!_ everyone exists.â€

â€œdoubtless, but not in the same way; everyone has not black slaves, a
princely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an
arabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and greek
mistresses.â€

piqued. â€œwhen i look at you parisians, idlers on the boulevard de gand
or the bois de boulogne, and think of this man, it seems to me we are
not of the same race.â€

â€œi am highly flattered,â€ returned beauchamp.

â€œat the same time,â€ added chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œyour count of monte cristo is
a very fine fellow, always excepting his little arrangements with the
italian banditti.â€

â€œthere are no italian banditti,â€ said debray.

â€œno vampire,â€ cried beauchamp.

â€œno count of monte cristoâ€ added debray. â€œthere is half-past ten
striking, albert.â€


â€œconfess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,â€
 continued beauchamp. but the sound of the clock had not died away when
germain announced, â€œhis excellency the count of monte cristo.â€ the
involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerfâ€™s narrative had
impressed them

but the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in
his toilet. every article of dress--hat, coat, gloves, and boots--was
from the first makers. he seemed scarcely five and thirty. but what
struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait debray had
drawn. the count advanced, smiling, into the centre of the room, and
approached albert, who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a
ceremonial manner. â€œpunctuality,â€ said monte cristo, â€œis the politeness
of kings, according to one of your sovereigns, i think; but it is not
the same with travellers. however, i hope you will excuse the two or
three seconds i am behindhand; five hundred leagues are not to be
accomplished without some trouble, and especially in france, where, it
seems, it is forbidden to beat the postilions.â€

â€œmy dear count,â€ replied albert, â€œi was announcing your visit to some of
my friends, whom i had invited in consequence o

secretary to the minister of the interior; m. beauchamp, an editor of a
paper, and the terror of the french government, but of whom, in spite of
his national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in italy, since his
paper is prohibited there; and m. maximilian morrel, captain of spahis.â€

at this name the count, who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy,
but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a pace
forward, and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks. â€œyou wear
the uniform of the new french conquerors, monsieur,â€ said he; â€œit is a
handsome uniform.â€ no one could have said what caused the countâ€™s voice
to vibrate so deeply, and what made his eye flash, which was in general
so clear, lustrous, and limpid when he pleased. â€œyou have never seen our
africans, count?â€ said albert. â€œnever,â€ replied the count, who was by
this time perfectly master of himse

yelid that show emotion. â€œah, you have a noble heart,â€ said the
count; â€œso much the better.â€ this exclamation, which corresponded to the
countâ€™s own thought rather than to what albert was saying, surprised
everybody, and especially morrel, who looked at monte cristo with
wonder. but, at the same time, the intonation was so soft that, however
strange the speech might seem, it was impossible to be offended at it.
â€œwhy should he doubt it?â€ said beauchamp to chÃ¢teau-renaud.


â€œin reality,â€ replied the latter, who, with his aristocratic glance and
his knowledge of the world, had penetrated at once all that was
penetrable in monte cristo, â€œalbert has not deceived us, for the count
is a most singular being. what say you, morrel!â€

â€œ_ma foi_, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in spite of
the singular remark he has made about me.â€

â€œgentlemen,â€ said albert, â€œgermain informs me that breakfast is ready.

 place. â€œgentlemen,â€ said the
count, seating himself, â€œpermit me to make a confession which must form
my excuse for any improprieties i may commit. i am a stranger, and a
stranger to such a degree, that this is the first time i have ever been
at paris. the french way of living is utterly unknown to me, and up to
the present time i have followed the eastern customs, which are entirely
in contrast to the parisian. i beg you, therefore, to excuse if you find
anything in me too turkish, too italian, or too arabian. now, then, let
us breakfast.â€

â€œwith what an air he says all this,â€ muttered beauchamp; â€œdecidedly he
is a great man.â€

â€œa great man in his own country,â€ added debray.

â€œa great man in every country, m. debray,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud. the
count was, it may be remembered, a most temperate guest. albert remarked
this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the parisian mode of
life should displease the traveller in the most essential point. â€œmy

taken, the effect is produced. ask baron franz dâ€™epinay; i think he
tasted them one day.â€

â€œyes,â€ replied morcerf, â€œhe said something about it to me.â€

â€œbut,â€ said beauchamp, who, as became a journalist, was very
incredulous, â€œyou always carry this drug about you?â€

â€œalways.â€

â€œwould it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?â€
 continued beauchamp, hoping to take him at a disadvantage.

â€œno, monsieur,â€ returned the count; and he drew from his pocket a
marvellous casket, formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden
lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet
about the size of a pea. this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor

â€œwith the condition that they should sin no more,â€ said beauchamp,
laughing. â€œi see they kept their promise.â€

â€œno, monsieur,â€ returned monte cristo â€œupon the simple condition that
they should respect myself and my friends. perhaps what i am about to
say may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt humanity and
your duty to your neighbor, but i never seek to protect a society which
does not protect me, and which i will even say, generally occupies
itself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low place
in my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is society
and my neighbor who are indebted to me.â€

danglars?â€

â€œyes,â€ returned morcerf, â€œa baron of a new creation.â€

â€œwhat matter,â€ said monte cristo â€œif he has rendered the state services
which merit this distinction?â€

â€œenormous ones,â€ answered beauchamp. â€œalthough in reality a liberal, he
negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x., in 1829, who made him
a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor; so that he wears the

â€œit is not that which deterred me,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œbut as i

he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it.â€

â€œbut you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows paris?â€ said
beauchamp.

â€œit is the first time he has ever been in paris. he is black, and cannot
speak,â€ returned monte cristo.

â€œit is ali!â€ cried albert, in the midst of the general surprise.

â€œyes, ali himself, my nubian mute, whom you saw, i think, at rome.â€

â€œcertainly,â€ said morcerf; â€œi recollect him perfectly. but how could you
charge a nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?--he will
do everything wrong.â€

that, on the contrary, he will choose everything as i wish. he knows my

air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said was
false--besides, why should he tell a falsehood? â€œwe must content
ourselves, then,â€ said beauchamp, â€œwith rendering the count all the
little services in our power. i, in my quality of journalist, open all
the theatres to him.â€

â€œthanks, monsieur,â€ returned monte cristo, â€œmy steward has orders to
take a box at each theatre.â€

â€œis your steward also a nubian?â€ asked debray.

â€œwho will tell her?â€

â€œthe first person who sees her.â€

â€œshe only speaks romaic.â€

â€œthat is different.â€

â€œbut at least we shall see her,â€ said beauchamp, â€œor do you keep eunuchs
as well as mutes?â€

â€œoh, no,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œi do not carry brutalism so far.
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when they leave me
will no longer have any need of me or anyone else; it is for that
reason, perhaps, that they do not quit me.â€ they had long since passed
to dessert and cigars.

â€œmy dear albert,â€ said debray, rising, â€œit is half-past two. your guest
is charming, but you leave the best company to go into the worst
sometimes. i must return to the ministerâ€™s. i will tell him of the

recognized their date, their country, and their origin. morcerf had
expected he should be the guide; on the contrary, it was he who, under
the countâ€™s guidance, followed a course of archÃ¦ology, mineralogy, and
natural history. they descended to the first floor; albert led his guest
into the salon. the salon was filled with the works of modern artists;
there were landscapes by duprÃ©, with their long reeds and tall trees,
their lowing oxen and marvellous skies; delacroixâ€™s arabian cavaliers,
with their long white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked
arms, their horses, who tore each other with their teeth while their
riders contended fiercely with their maces; _aquarelles_ of boulanger,
representing notre dame de paris with that vigor that makes the artist
the rival of the poet; there were paintings by diaz, who makes his
flowers more beautiful than flowers, his suns more brilliant than the
sun; designs by decamp, as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa,

certainly without the slightest premeditation, â€˜at such a period i was

compared the dates, and never found him inaccurate. the age of this
singular man, who is of no age, is then, i am certain, thirty-five.
besides, mother, remark how vivid his eye, how raven-black his hair, and

vigorous, but also young.â€ the countess bent her head, as if beneath a

chapter 42. monsieur bertuccio

meanwhile the count had arrived at his house; it had taken him six
minutes to perform the distance, but these six minutes were sufficient
to induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had
been unable to purchase themselves, to put their horses in a gallop in
order to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20,000 francs
apiece for his horses.

the house ali had chosen, and which was to serve as a town residence to
monte cristo, was situated on the right hand as you ascend the champs-
Ã©lysÃ©es. a thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre, and
masked a portion of the front; around this shrubbery two alleys, like
two arms, extended right and left, and formed a carriage-drive from the
iron gates to a double portico, on every step of which stood a porcelain
vase, filled with flowers. this house, isolated from the rest, had,

coachman had hailed the _concierge_, the massy gates rolled on their
hinges--they had seen the count coming, and at paris, as everywhere
else, he was served with the rapidity of lightning. the coachman entered
and traversed the half-circle without slackening his speed, and the
gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel. the
carriage stopped at the left side of the portico, two men presented
themselves at the carriage-window; the one was ali, who, smiling with an
expression of the most sincere joy, seemed amply repaid by a mere look
from monte cristo. the other bowed respectfully, and offered his arm to
assist the count in descending. â€œthanks, m. bertuccio,â€ said the count,
springing lightly up the three steps of the portico; â€œand the notary?â€

â€œhe is in the small salon, excellency,â€ returned bertuccio.

of the house?â€

monte cristo examined him with the same look that, at rome, he had bent
upon the execution of andrea, and then, in a tone that made a shudder
pass through the veins of the poor steward,--â€œthe abbÃ© busoni, then told
me an untruth,â€ said he, â€œwhen, after his journey in france, in 1829, he
sent you to me, with a letter of recommendation, in which he enumerated
all your valuable qualities. well, i shall write to the abbÃ©; i shall
hold him responsible for his _protÃ©gÃ©â€™s_ misconduct, and i shall soon
know all about this assassination. only i warn you, that when i reside
in a country, i conform to all its code, and i have no wish to put

â€œoh, do not do that, excellency; i have always served you faithfully,â€
 cried bertuccio, in despair. â€œi have always been an honest man, and, as
far as lay in my power, i

â€œwhose, then? the marquis de saint-mÃ©ran, i think, the concierge said.
what had you to revenge on the marquis de saint-mÃ©ran?â€

â€œoh, it was not on him, monsieur; it was on another.â€

â€œthis is strange,â€ returned monte cristo, seeming to yield to his
reflections, â€œthat you should find yourself without any preparation in a
house where the event happened that causes you so much remorse.â€

â€œmonsieur,â€ said the steward, â€œit is fatality, i am sure. first, you
purchase a house at auteuil--this house is the one where i have
committed an assassination; you descend to the garden by the same
staircase by which he descended; you stop at the spot where he received
the blow; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried
his child. this is not chance, for chance, in this case, is too much
like providence.â€

â€œwell, amiable corsican, let us suppose it is providence. i always

â€œgo on; i will keep my word.â€

â€œone day we received a letter. i should tell you that we lived in the
little village of rogliano, at the extremity of cap corse. this letter
was from my brother. he told us that the army was disbanded, and that he
should return by chÃ¢teauroux, clermont-ferrand, le puy, and nÃ®mes; and,
if i had any money, he prayed me to leave it for him at nÃ®mes, with an
innkeeper with whom i had dealings.â€

â€œin the smuggling line?â€ said monte cristo.

â€œeh, your excellency? everyone must live.â€

â€œcertainly; go on.â€

â€œi loved my brother tenderly, as i told your excellency, and i resolved
not to send the money, but to take it to him myself. i possessed a
thousand francs. i left five hundred with assunta, my sister-in-law, and
with the other five hundred i set off for nÃ®mes. it was easy to do so,
and as i had my boat and a lading to take in at sea, everything favored
my project.

terrified, not for myself--for i, a simple corsican fisherman, had
nothing to fear; on the contrary, that time was most favorable for us
smugglers--but for my brother, a soldier of the empire, returning from
the army of the loire, with his uniform and his epaulets, there was
everything to apprehend. i hastened to the innkeeper. my misgivings had
been but too true. my brother had arrived the previous evening at nÃ®mes,
and, at the very door of the house where he was about to demand
hospitality, he had been assassinated. i did all in my power to discover
the murderers, but no one durst tell me their names, so much were they
dreaded. i then thought of that french justice of which i had heard so
much, and which feared nothing, and i went to the kingâ€™s attorney.â€

â€œand this kingâ€™s attorney was named villefort?â€ asked monte cristo
carelessly.

â€œyes, your excellency; he came from marseilles, where he had been
deputy-procureur. his zeal had procured him advancement, and he was

â€œthen,â€ said monte cristo â€œyou went to him?â€

â€œâ€˜monsieur,â€™ i said, â€˜my brother was assassinated yesterday in the
streets of nÃ®mes, i know not by whom, but it is your duty to find out.
you are the representative of justice here, and it is for justice to
avenge those she has been unable to protect.â€™--â€˜who was your brother?â€™
asked he.--â€˜a lieutenant in the corsican battalion.â€™--â€˜a soldier of the
usurper, then?â€™--â€˜a soldier of the french army.â€™--â€˜well,â€™ replied he,
â€˜he has smitten with the sword, and he has perished by the sword.â€™--â€˜you
are mistaken, monsieur,â€™ i replied; â€˜he has perished by the poniard.â€™--
â€˜what do you want me to do?â€™ asked the magistrate.--â€˜i have already told
you--avenge him.â€™--â€˜on whom?â€™--â€˜on his murderers.â€™--â€˜how should i know
who they are?â€™--â€˜order them to be sought for.â€™--â€˜why, your brothe

shall have you put out.â€™

â€œi looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from
further entreaty. but he was a man of stone. i approached him, and said
in a low voice, â€˜well, since you know the corsicans so well, you know
that they always keep their word. you think that it was a good deed to
kill my brother, who was a bonapartist, because you are a royalist.
well, i, who am a bonapartist also, declare one thing to you, which is,
that i will kill you. from this moment i declare the vendetta against
you, so protect yourself as well as you can, for the next time we meet
your last hour has come.â€™ and before he had recovered from his surprise,
i opened the door and left the room.â€

â€œwell, well,â€ said monte cristo, â€œsuch an innocent looking person as you
are to do those things, m. bertuccio, and to a kingâ€™s attorney at that!
but did he kno

w what was meant by the terrible word â€˜vendettaâ€™?â€

â€œhe knew so well, that from that moment he shut himself in his house,
and never went out unattended, seeking me high and low. fortunately, i
was so well concealed that he could not find me. then he became alarmed,
and dared not stay any longer at nÃ®mes, so he solicited a change of
residence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was nominated
to versailles. but, as you know, a corsican who has sworn to avenge
himself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it went, was
never above half a dayâ€™s journey before me, who followed him on foot.
the most important thing was, not to kill him only--for i had an
opportunity of doing so a hundred times--but to kill him without being
discovered--at least, without being arrested. i no longer belonged to
myself, for i had my sister-in-law to protect

â€œwhat are they, your excellency?â€

â€œwhat became of this little boy? for i think you told me it was a boy,
m. bertuccio.â€

â€œno excellency, i do not recollect telling you that.â€

â€œi thought you did; i must have been mistaken.â€

â€œno, you were not, for it was in reality a little boy. but your
excellency wished to know two things; what was the second?â€

â€œthe second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a
confessor, and the abbÃ© busoni came to visit you at your request in the
prison at nÃ®mes.â€

â€œthe story will be very long, excellency.â€

â€œwhat matter? you know i take but little sleep, and i do not suppose you

story.

and in my past life they might find something far more grave than the
selling of smuggled cigars, or barrels of brandy without a permit. so,
preferring death to capture, i accomplished the most astonishing deeds,
and which, more than once, showed me that the too great care we take of
our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which
require rapid decision, and vigorous and determined execution. in
reality, when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises, you
are no longer the equal of other men, or, rather, other men are no
longer your equals, and whosoever has taken this resolution, feels his
strength and resources doubled.â€

â€œphilosophy, m. bertuccio,â€ interrupted the count; â€œyou have done a
little of everything in your life.â€

â€œoh, excellency!â€

â€œno, no; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late; yet

â€œalas, your excellency is right,â€ replied bertuccio, â€œand god made this
infant the instrument of our punishment. never did a perverse nature

in his bringing up. he was a most lovely child, with large blue eyes, of
that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion; only
his hair, which was too light, gave his face a most singular expression,
and added to the vivacity of his look, and the malice of his smile.
unfortunately, there is a proverb which says that â€˜red is either
altogether good or altogether bad.â€™ the proverb was but too correct as
regarded benedetto, and even in his infancy he manifested the worst

encouraged him. this child, for whom my poor sister would go to the

caderousse entered with a stranger.

â€œi waited patiently, not to overhear what they said, but because i could
do nothing else; besides, the same thing had occurred often before. the
man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of
france; he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the
beaucaire fair, and who during the month the fair lasts, and during
which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all
parts of europe, often have dealings to the amount of 100,000 to 150,000
francs. caderousse entered hastily. then, seeing that the room was, as
usual, empty, and only guarded by the dog, he called to his wife,
â€˜hello, carconte,â€™ said he, â€˜the worthy priest has not deceived us; the
diamond is real.â€™ an exclamation of joy was heard, and the staircase
creaked beneath a feeble step. â€˜what do you say?â€™ asked his wife, pale
as death.

â€œâ€˜i say that the diamond is real, and that this gentleman, one of the

caderousse. â€˜i thought we agreed for the price i asked.â€™--â€˜that is,â€™
replied the jeweller, â€˜i offered 40,000 francs.â€™--â€˜forty thousand,â€™
cried la carconte; â€˜we will not part with it for that sum. the abbÃ© told
us it was worth 50,000. without the setting.â€™

â€œâ€˜what was the abbÃ©â€™s name?â€™ asked the indefatigable questioner.--â€˜the
abbÃ© busoni,â€™ said la carconte.--â€˜he was a foreigner?â€™--â€˜an italian,
from the neighborhood of mantua, i believe.â€™--â€˜let me see this diamond
again,â€™ replied the jeweller; â€˜the first time you are often mistaken as
to the value of a stone.â€™ caderousse took from his pocket a small case
of black shagreen, opened, and gave it to the jeweller. at the sight of
the diamond, which was as large as a hazel-nut, la carconteâ€™s eyes
sparkled with cupidity.â€

â€œand what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?â€ said monte
cristo; â€œdid you credit it?

inform against us, and, as he says, who knows if we shall ever again see
the abbÃ© busoni?--in all probability we shall never see him.â€™--â€˜well,
then, so i will!â€™ said caderousse; â€˜so you may have the diamond for
45,000 francs. but my wife wants a gold chain, and i want a pair of
silver buckles.â€™ the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box,
which contained several samples of the articles demanded. â€˜here,â€™ he
said, â€˜i am very straightforward in my dealings--take your choice.â€™ the
woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis, and the husband a
pair of buckles, worth perhaps fifteen francs.--â€˜i hope you will not
complain now?â€™ said the jeweller.

â€œâ€˜the abbÃ© told me it was worth 50,000 francs,â€™ muttered caderousse.
â€˜come, come--give it to me! what a strange fellow you are,â€™ said the
jeweller, taking the diamond from his hand. â€˜i give you 45,000 francs--
that is, 2,500 livres of income,--a fortune such as i wish i had myse

on the contrary, rose, and going with a firm step towards the door,
opened it, saying, as she did so--â€˜come in, dear m. joannes.â€™--â€˜_ma

return to beaucaire tonight. the shortest follies are best, my dear
caderousse. you offered me hospitality, and i accept it, and have
returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof.â€™ caderousse stammered out
something, while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow. la
carconte double-locked the door behind the jeweller.â€

cristo, left alone, took three or four steps onwards, and murmured,
â€œhere, beneath this plane-tree, must have been where the infantâ€™s grave
was dug. there is the little door opening into the garden. at this
corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping
apartment. there will be no necessity for me to make a note of these
particulars, for there, before my eyes, beneath my feet, all around me,
i have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth.â€ after
making the tour of the garden a second time, the count re-entered his
carriage, while bertuccio, who perceived the thoughtful expression of
his masterâ€™s features, took his seat beside the driver without uttering
a word. the carriage proceeded rapidly towards paris.

that same evening, upon reaching his abode in the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es, the
count of monte cristo went over the whole building with the air of one
long acquainted with each nook or corner. nor, although preceding

error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him
to a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit. ali was his principal
attendant during this nocturnal survey. having given various orders to
bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to
make in the house, the count, drawing out his watch, said to the
attentive nubian, â€œit is half-past eleven oâ€™clock; haydÃ©e will soon be
here. have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming?â€ ali
extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair greek,
which were so effectually concealed by means of a tape

that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their
existence. ali, having pointed to the apartments, held up three fingers
of his right hand, and then, placing it beneath his head, shut his eyes,
and feigned to sleep. â€œi understand,â€ said monte cristo, well acquainted
with aliâ€™s pantomime; â€œyou mean to tell me that three female attendants
await their new mistress in her sleeping-chamber.â€ ali, with
considerable animation, made a sign in the affirmative.

â€œmadame will be tired tonight,â€ continued monte cristo, â€œand will, no
doubt, wish to rest. desire the french attendants not to weary her with
questions, but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire. you will
also see that the greek servants hold no communication with those of
this country.â€ he bowed. just at that moment voices were heard hailing
the concierge. the gate opened, a carriage rolled down the avenue, and

sented himself at
the already opened carriage door, and held out his hand to a young
woman, completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered
with gold. she raised the hand extended towards her to her lips, and
kissed it with a mixture of love and respect. some few words passed
between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods
converse. the young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness,
while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity. preceded by ali,
who carried a rose-colored flambeau in his hand, the new-comer, who was
no other than the lovely greek who had been monte cristoâ€™s companion in
italy, was conducted to her apartments, while the count retired to the
pavilion reserved for himself. in another hour every light in the house
was extinguished, and it might have been thought that all its inmates
slept.

porterâ€™s lodge, saying, â€œpray, does not the count of monte cristo live

â€œhis excellency does reside here,â€ replied the concierge; â€œbut----â€
 added he, glancing an inquiring look at ali. ali returned a sign in the
negative.

â€œbut what?â€ asked the groom.

â€œhis excellency does not receive visitors today.â€

â€œthen here is my masterâ€™s card,--the baron danglars. you will take it to
the count, and say that, although in haste to attend the chamber, my
master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him.â€

an excellent lorgnette, as danglars himself had scrutinized the house,
garden, and servants. â€œthat fellow has a decidedly bad countenance,â€
 said the count in a tone of disgust, as he shut up his glass into its
ivory case. â€œhow comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight
of that flat, receding, serpent-like forehead, round, vulture-shaped
head, and sharp-hooked nose, like the beak of a buzzard? ali,â€ cried he,

apartment. â€œdid your excellency desire to see me?â€ inquired he. â€œi did,â€
 replied the count. â€œyou no doubt observed the horses standing a few
minutes since at the door?â€

â€œcertainly, your excellency. i noticed them for their remarkable
beauty.â€

none would have thought him capable of showing, either in voice or face-

to assure your excellency,â€ said bertuccio, â€œthat the horses you speak
of were not to be sold when i purchased yours.â€ monte cristo shrugged
his shoulders. â€œit seems, sir steward,â€ said he, â€œthat you hav

was about to retire; but when he reached the door, he paused, and then
said, â€œat what oâ€™clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses
to be ready?â€

â€œat five oâ€™clock,â€ replied the count.

â€œi beg your excellencyâ€™s pardon,â€ interposed the steward in a
deprecating manner, â€œfor venturing to observe that it is already two
oâ€™clock.â€

â€œi am perfectly aware of that fact,â€ answered monte cristo calmly. then,
turning towards ali, he said, â€œlet all the horses in my stables be led
before the windows of your young lady, that she may select those she
prefers for her carriage. request her also to oblige me by saying
whether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so, let dinner be served
in her apartments. now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to come
hither.â€ scarcely had ali disappeared when the valet entered the
chamber. â€œmonsieur baptistin,â€ said the count, â€œyou have been in my
service one year, the tim

count, â€œthat i lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my
establishment; those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose (as a matter of

fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me, and among whom
it will be divided at my death. you have been in my service a year, your
fund has already begun to accumulate--let it continue to do so.â€

this address, delivered in the presence of ali, who, not understanding
one word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved,
produced an effect on m. baptistin only to be conceived by such as have
occasion to study the character and disposition of french domestics. â€œi
assure your excellency,â€ said he, â€œthat at least it shall be my study to
merit your approbation in all things, and i will take m. ali as my
model.â€

eyes with astonishment.

â€œyou seem incredulous,â€ said monte cristo, who repeated to ali in the
arabic language what he had just been saying to baptistin in french. the
nubian smiled assentingly to his masterâ€™s words, then, kneeling on one
knee, respectfully kissed the hand of the count. this corroboration of
the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder
and stupefaction of m. baptistin. the count then motioned the valet de

conversed long and earnestly together. as the hand of the clock poin

steward entered. â€œmy horses,â€ said monte cristo.

â€œthey are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency
desired. does your excellency wish me to accompany him?â€

â€œno, the coachman, ali, and baptistin will go.â€ the count descended to
the door of his mansion, and beheld his carriage drawn by the very pair
of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property of
danglars. as he passed them he said--â€œthey are extremely handsome
certainly, and you have done well to purchase them, although you were
somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner.â€

ceiling. the count turned round as he heard the entrance of danglars
into the room. with a slight inclination of the head, danglars signed to
the count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded armchair,
covered with white satin embroidered with gold. the count sat down. â€œi

monte cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baronâ€™s card.

danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips. â€œyou will, i trust,
excuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your title when i first
addressed you,â€ he said, â€œbut you are aware that we are living under a
popular form of government, and that i am myself a representative of the

each rosette that adorned either side of their heads, had been fastened

whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire, and to beg the baroness to
pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses.

during the evening, monte cristo quitted paris for auteuil, accompanied
by ali. the following day, about three oâ€™clock, a single blow struck on
the gong summoned ali to the presence of the count. â€œali,â€ observed his
master, as the nubian entered the chamber, â€œyou have frequently
explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the
lasso, have you not?â€ ali drew himself up proudly, and then returned a
sign in the affirmative. â€œi thought i did not mistake. with your lasso
you could stop an ox?â€ again ali repeated his affirmative gesture. â€œo

forwards, imitating the action of one throwing the lasso, then of a

the lion?â€ ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had
indeed both chased and captured many lions. â€œbut do you believe you
could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with
ungovernable fury?â€ the nubian smiled. â€œit is well,â€ said monte cristo.
â€œthen listen to me. ere long a carriage will dash past here, drawn by
the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday; now, at the
risk of your own life, you must manage to stop those horses before my

he had traced to the count, who was watching him. the count patted him
gently on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising ali, who, pleased and
gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a
projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and, seating
himself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while monte cristo re-
entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his plan.
still, as five oâ€™clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily
expected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience and
uneasiness might be observed in his manner. he stationed hi

room commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with restless
steps, stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of
approaching wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on ali; but the
regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque
proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his
favorite occupation. suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing
wheels was heard, and almost immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by a
pair of wild, ungovernable horses, while the terrified coachman strove
in vain to restrain their furious speed.

rms. terror seemed to have deprived them even
of the power of uttering a cry. the carriage creaked and rattled as it
flew over the rough stones, and the slightest obstacle under the wheels
would have caused disaster; but it kept on in the middle of the road,
and those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror.

ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque, drew the lasso from his pocket,
threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its
triple fold, and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by
the violence of the shock, then the animal fell over on the pole, which
snapped, and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way.
gladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from
his box; but ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse,

that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child! most
certainly, but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant, this

â€œindeed, i still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in.â€

â€œi trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your
man.â€

â€œi beseech you, madame,â€ replied monte cristo â€œnot to spoil ali, either
by too great praise or rewards. i cannot allow him to acquire the habit
of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render.
ali is my slave, and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty
to me.â€

â€œnay,â€ interposed madame de villefort, on whom the authoritative style
adopted by the count made a deep impression, â€œnay, but consider that to
preserve my life he has risked his own.â€

or caprices, to pull the corks out of all the bottles.

â€œtouch nothing, my little friend,â€ cried the count eagerly; â€œsome of
those liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to inhale.â€

madame de villefort became very pale, and, seizing her sonâ€™s arm, drew
him anxiously toward her; but, once satisfied of his safety, she also
cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket, which was not lost
upon the count. at this moment ali entered. at sight of him madame de
villefort uttered an expression of pleasure, and, holding the child
still closer towards her, she said, â€œedward, dearest, do you see that
good man? he has shown very great courage and resolution, for he exposed
his own life to stop the horses that were running away with us, and
would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces. thank him, then, my
child, in your very best manner; for, had he not come to our aid,

stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner,
saying, â€œheâ€™s too ugly.â€


the count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while
madame de villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation
very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed.
â€œthis lady,â€ said the count, speaking to ali in the arabic language, â€œis
desirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives; but
the boy refuses, saying you are too ugly.â€ ali turned his intelligent
countenance towards the boy, on whom he gazed without any apparent
emotion; but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the
practiced eye of monte cristo that the arab had been wounded to the
heart.

â€œwill you permit me to inquire,â€ said madame de villefort, as she arose
to take her leave, â€œwhether you usually

â€œno, i do not,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œit is a small place i have
purchased quite lately. my place of abode is no. 30, avenue des champs-

no doubt, desirous of returning home. anticipating your wishes, i have
desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages,
and ali, he whom you think so very ugly,â€ continued he, addressing the
boy with a smiling air, â€œwill have the honor of driving you home, while
your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your
calash. as soon as that important business is concluded, i will have a
pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars.â€

animals, who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty,
he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic
vinegar, and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths.

their bodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by the noisy crowd

ition in the magistracy, and maintained his
eminence like a harlay or a molÃ©. his drawing-room, under the
regenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first
marriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of the well-regulated paris
salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of
rigid etiquette were carefully maintained. a freezing politeness, a
strict fidelity to government principles, a profound contempt for
theories and theorists, a deep-seated hatred of ideality,--these were
the elements of private and public life displayed by m. de villefort.


m. de villefort was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomatist.
his relations with the former court, of which he always spoke with
dignity and respect, made him respected by the new one, and he knew so
many things, that not only was he always carefully considered, but
sometimes consulted. perhaps this would not have been so had it been
possible to get rid of m. de villefort; but, like the feudal baron

this fortress was his post as kingâ€™s attorney, all the advantages of
which he exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have
resigned but to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by
opposition. ordinarily m. de villefort made and returned very few
visits. his wife visited for him, and this was the received thing in the
world, where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate
were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a
manifestation of professed superiority--in fact, the application of the
axiom, _pretend to think well of yourself, and the world will think well
of you_, an axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays

expeditious in barbarous countries, takes with us a prudent and well-
studied course.â€

â€œoh, yes--yes, i do, sir; it is the _pede claudo_ of the ancients. i
know all that, for it is with the justice of all countries especially
that i have occupied myself--it is with the criminal procedure of all
nations that i have compared natural justice, and i must say, sir, that
it is the law of primitive nations, that is, the law of retaliation,
that i have most frequently found to be according to the law of god.â€

â€œif this law were adopted, sir,â€ said the procureur, â€œit would greatly
simplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates would not (as
you just observed) have much to do.â€

â€œit may, perhaps, come to this in time,â€ observed monte cristo; â€œyou
know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple, and
simplicity is always perfection.â€

â€œthen you yourself are one of these marked beings?â€

â€œyes, monsieur, i believe so; for until now, no man has found himself in
a position similar to mine. the dominions of kings are limited either by
mountains or rivers, or a change of manners, or an alteration of
language. my kingdom is bounded only by the world, for i am not an
italian, or a frenchman, or a hindu, or an american, or a spaniard--i am
a cosmopolite. no country can say it saw my birth. god alone knows what
country will see me die. i adopt all customs, speak all languages. you
believe me to be a frenchman, for i speak french with the same facility
and purity as yourself. well, ali, my nubian, believes me to be an arab;
bertuccio, my steward, takes me for a roman; haydÃ©e, my slave, thinks me

â€œsir,â€ continued villefort, â€œthere is something to fear besides death,
old age, and madness. for instance, there is apoplexy--that lightning-
stroke which strikes but does not destroy you, and yet which brings
everything to an end. you are still yourself as now, and yet you are
yourself no longer; you who, like ariel, verge on the angelic, are but
an inert mass, which, like caliban, verges on the brutal; and this is
called in human tongues, as i tell you, neither more nor less than
apoplexy. come, if so you will, count, and continue this conversation at
my house, any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of
understanding and anxious to refute you, and i will show you my father,

revolution; that is to say, he had the most remarkable audacity,

seeing villefort to the door of his cabinet, the procureur being
escorted to his carriage by two footmen, who, on a signal from their
master, followed him with every mark of attention. when he had gone,
monte cristo breathed a profound sigh, and said,--â€œenough of this
poison, let me now seek the antidote.â€ then sounding his bell, he said
to ali, who entered, â€œi am going to madamâ€™s chamber--have the carriage
ready at one oâ€™clock.â€



chapter 49. haydÃ©e

it will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of the
count of monte cristo, residing in the rue meslay, were no other than
maximilian, julie, and emmanuel. the very anticipations of delight to be
enjoyed in his forthcoming visits--the bright, pure gleam of heavenly
happiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had
voluntarily engaged, illu

mined his whole countenance with a look of
ineffable joy and calmness, as, immediately after villefortâ€™s departure,
his thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him, of tasting,
at least, a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his
mind. even ali, who had hastened to obey the countâ€™s summons, went forth
from his masterâ€™s presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation
and pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold; while,
as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over
his patronâ€™s meditations, whatever they were, the faithful nubian walked
on tiptoe towards the door, holding his breath, lest its faintest sound
should dissipate his masterâ€™s happy reverie.

understand, haydÃ©e,â€ said the count, â€œthat from this moment you are
absolutely free; that here you exercise unlimited sway, and are at
liberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country, as it may
suit your inclination. within this mansion you are absolute mistress of
your actions, and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem
most agreeable to you. a carriage waits your orders, and ali and myrto

favor i would entreat of you.â€

illustrious father or ill-fated mother.â€

 the countâ€™s cheeks became scarlet, and he coughed, in order to have an
excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth. â€œthose born to wealth,
and who have the means of gratifying every wish,â€ said emmanuel, â€œknow
not what is the real happiness of life, just as those who have been
tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone
realize the blessings of fair weather.â€

monte cristo rose, and without making any answer (for the tremulousness
of his voice would have betrayed his emotion) walked up and down the
apartment with a slow step.

â€œour magnificence makes you smile, count,â€ said maximilian, who had
followed him with his eyes. â€œno, no,â€ returned monte cristo, pale as
death, pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings, while
with the other he pointed to a crystal cover, beneath which a silken
purse lay

then, noticing that julie was struck with the sound of his voice,--

â€œtell me,â€ continued he, â€œwas he not about my height, perhaps a little
taller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his coat
closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?â€

â€œoh, do you then know him?â€ cried julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy.

â€œno,â€ returned monte cristo â€œi only guessed. i knew a lord wilmore, who
was constantly doing actions of this kind.â€

â€œwithout revealing himself?â€

â€œhe was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of
gratitude.â€

â€œoh, heaven,â€ exclaimed julie, clasping her hands, â€œin what did he
believe, then?â€


â€œhe did not credit it at the period which i knew him,â€ said monte
cristo, touched to the heart by the accents of julieâ€™s voice; â€œbut,
perhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist.â€

plebeian attire. after casting a rapid glance around him, in order to
assure himself that he was unobserved, he entered by the small gate,
and, carefully closing and securing it after him, proceeded with a
hurried step towards the barrier.

at the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a costume,
the young woman started in terror, and was about to make a hasty
retreat. but the eye of love had already seen, even through the narrow
chinks of the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe, and
observed the fluttering of the blue sash. pressing his lips close to the
planks, he exclaimed, â€œdonâ€™t be alarmed, valentine--it is i!â€ again the
timid girl found courage to return to the gate, saying, as she did so,
â€œand why do you come so late today? it is almost dinner-time, and i had

â€œa trade? oh, maximilian, how can you jest at a time when we have such
deep cause for uneasiness?â€

â€œheaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than
life itself! but listen to me, valentine, and i will tell you all about
it. i became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and seriously
alarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering about here
your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief. that
would compromise the honor of the french army, to say nothing of the
fact that the continual presence of a captain of spahis in a place where
no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well
create surprise; so i have become a gardener, and, consequently, adopted
the costume of my calling.â€

half-malicious, half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up and took
his leave; then, for the first time, i observed the agitation of my
grandfather, and i must tell you, maximilian, that i am the only person
capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame. and i suspected
that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence (for they
always say and do what they like before the dear old man, without the
smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong impression on his
mind; for, natur

reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics? but to
resume my story; i turned towards my grandfather, as though to question
him as to the cause of his emotion; he looked expressively at the
newspaper i had been reading. â€˜what is the matter, dear grandfather?â€™

usual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite
composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience.
morcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his
orchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least
a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance;
he had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus box. chÃ¢teau-
renaud rented a stall beside his own, while beauchamp, as a journalist,
had unlimited range all over the theatre. it happened that on this
particular night the ministerâ€™s box was placed at the disposal of lucien
debray, who offered it to the comte de morcerf, who again, upon his
motherâ€™s rejection of it, sent it to danglars, with an intimation that
he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her
daughter during the evening, in the event of their accepting the box in
question. the ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dre

gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been

circle, in which sat the countess g----, and where morcerf had just made

the countess, extending her hand to him with all the warmth and

recognize me so quickly, and still more so to bestow your first visit on

â€œthat is possible--go.â€

passing the countâ€™s box, the door opened, and monte cristo came forth.
after giving some directions to ali, who stood in the lobby, the count
took albertâ€™s arm. carefully closing the box door, ali placed himself
before it, while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian.

â€œupon my word,â€ said monte cristo, â€œparis is a strange city, and the
parisians a very singular people. see that cluster of persons collected
around poor ali, who is as much astonished as themselves; really one
might suppose he was the only nubian they had ever beheld. now i can

your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend, madame de

â€œthis time, at least, i do not deserve your thanks. it was ali, my

â€œwas it ali,â€ asked the count of morcerf, â€œwho rescued my son from the
hands of bandits?â€

indeed there existed one--and i feel almost mortified to find you still

â€œno, mademoiselle,â€ said monte cristo, astonished at the coolness and
freedom of the question. â€œshe is a poor unfortunate greek left under my
care.â€

â€œand what is her name?â€

â€œhaydÃ©e,â€ replied monte cristo.

â€œa greek?â€ murmured the count of morcerf.

served, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?â€

â€œdid i hear rightly, monsieur,â€ said monte cristo â€œthat you served at
yanina?â€

â€œi was inspector-general of the pashaâ€™s troops,â€ replied morcerf; â€œand
it is no secret that i owe my fortune, such as it is, to the liberality
of the illustrious albanese chief.â€

â€œbut look!â€ exclaimed madame danglars.

â€œwhere?â€ stammered morcerf.

â€œthere,â€ said monte cristo placing his

 arms around the count, and
leaning with him over the front of the box, just as haydÃ©e, whose eyes
were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian,
perceived his pale features close to morcerfâ€™s face. it was as if the
young girl beheld the head of medusa. she bent forwards as though to
assure herself of the reality of what she saw, then, uttering a faint
cry, threw herself back in her seat. the sound was heard by the people
about ali, who instantly opened the box-door. â€œwhy, count,â€ exclaimed
eugÃ©nie, â€œwhat has happened to your ward? she seems to have been taken
suddenly ill.

â€œvery probably,â€ answered the count. â€œbut do not be alarmed on her
account. haydÃ©eâ€™s nervous system is delicately organized, and she is
peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers--nay, there are some
which cause her to faint if brought into her presence. however,â€

300,000 livres.â€

â€œthat is not his biggest scoop,â€ said morcerf; â€œdid he not make a

â€œsaturday.â€

â€œthis is tuesday--well, tomorrow evening we leave, and the day after we
shall be at trÃ©port. really, count, you have a delightful way of setting

moustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by baptistin, who had
received an exact description of the expected visitor, and who was
awaiting him in the hall. therefore, scarcely had the stranger time to
pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival. he was
ushered into a simple and elegant drawing-room, and the count rose to
meet him with a smiling air. â€œah, my dear sir, you are most welcome; i
was expecting you.â€

â€œindeed,â€ said the italian, â€œwas your excellency then aware of my
visit?â€

â€œyes; i had been told that i should see you today at seven oâ€™clock.â€

â€œthen you have received full information concerning my arrival?â€

â€œof course.â€

â€œah, so much the better, i feared this little precaution might have been
forgotten.â€

â€œwhat precaution?â€

â€œthat of informing you beforehand of my coming.â€

â€œoh, no, it has not.â€


â€œbut you are sure you are not mistaken.â€

â€œoh, no, never mind that,â€ said the italian; â€œit is not worth the
trouble.â€

â€œyes, yes,â€ said monte cristo. his visitor appeared slightly uneasy.
â€œlet me see,â€ said the count; â€œare you not the marquis bartolomeo
cavalcanti?â€

â€œbartolomeo cavalcanti,â€ joyfully replied the italian; â€œyes, i am really
he.â€

â€œex-major in the austrian service?â€

â€œwas i a major?â€ timidly asked the old soldier.

â€œyes,â€ said monte cristo â€œyou were a major; that is the title the french
give to the post which you filled in italy.â€

â€œvery good,â€ said the major, â€œi do not demand more, you understand----â€

â€œyour visit here today is not of your own suggestion, is it?â€ said monte
cristo.

â€œno, certainly not.â€

â€œyou were sent by some other person?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œhalf a million, is it?â€ said the major.

â€œyes, in so many words; and it must be so, for the abbÃ© knows correctly
the amount of all the largest fortunes in europe.â€

â€œbe it half a million, then; but on my word of honor, i had no idea that
it was so much.â€

â€œbecause you are robbed by your steward. you must make some reformation
in that quarter.â€

â€œyou have opened my eyes,â€ said the italian gravely; â€œi will show the
gentlemen the door.â€ monte cristo resumed the perusal of the letter:--

â€œâ€˜and who only needs one thing more to make him happy.â€™â€

â€œyes, indeed but one!â€ said the major with a sigh.

â€œâ€˜which is to recover a lost and adored son.â€™â€

â€œa lost and adored son!â€

â€œâ€˜stolen away in his infancy, either by an enemy of his noble family or
by the gypsies.â€™â€

â€œat the age of five years!â€ said the major with a deep sigh, and raising
his eye to

â€œso that you will remit to me these 48,000 francs?â€

â€œcertainly, at your first request.â€ the majorâ€™s eyes dilated with
pleasing astonishment. â€œbut sit down,â€ said monte cristo; â€œreally i do
not know what i have been thinking of--i have positively kept you
standing for the last quarter of an hour.â€

â€œdonâ€™t mention it.â€ the major drew an armchair towards him, and
proceeded to seat himself.

â€œnow,â€ said the count, â€œwhat will you take--a glass of sherry, port, or
alicante?â€

â€œalicante, if you please; it is my favorite wine.â€

â€œi have some that is very good. you will take a biscuit with it, will
you not?â€

â€œyes, i will take a biscuit, as you are so obliging.â€

monte cristo rang; baptistin appeared. the count advanced to meet him.

â€œwell?â€ said he in a low voice.

â€œthe young man is here,â€ said the valet de chambre in the same tone.

â€œinto what room did you take him?â€

â€œinto the blue drawing-room, according to your excellencyâ€™s or

â€œthatâ€™s right; now bring the alicante and some biscuits.â€

baptistin left the room. â€œreally,â€ said the major, â€œi am quite ashamed
of the trouble i am giving you.â€

â€œpray donâ€™t mention such a thing,â€ said the count. baptistin re-entered
with glasses, wine, and biscuits. the count filled one glass, but in the
other he only poured a few drops of the ruby-colored liquid. the bottle
was covered with spidersâ€™ webs, and all the other signs which indicate
the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a manâ€™s face.

made a wise choice; he took the full glass and a biscuit. the count told
baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest, who began by
sipping the alicante with an expression of great satisfaction, and then
delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine.

â€œso, sir, you lived at lucca, did you? you were rich, noble, held in
great esteem--had all that could render a man happy?â€


â€œall,â€ said the major, hastily swallowing his biscuit, â€œpositively all.â€

â€œand yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your
happiness?â€

â€œonly one thing,â€ said the italian.

â€œand that one thing, your lost child.â€

â€œnot on your own account, surely,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œfor a man is
above that sort of thing?â€

â€œoh, no, certainly not on my own account,â€ said the major with a smile
and a shake of the head.

â€œbut for the sake of the mother?â€ said the count.

â€œyes, for the motherâ€™s sake--his poor mother!â€ cried the major, taking a
third biscuit.

â€œtake some more wine, my dear cavalcanti,â€ said the count, pouring out
for him a second glass of alicante; â€œyour emotion has quite overcome
you.â€

â€œhis poor mother,â€ murmured the major, trying to get the lachrymal gland
in operation, so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear.

â€œshe belonged to one of the first families in italy, i think, did she
not?â€

â€œshe was of a noble family of fiesole, count.â€

â€œand her name was----â€

â€œdo you desire to know her name----?â€

â€œa marchioness!â€

â€œand you married her at last, notwithstanding the opposition of her
family?â€

â€œyes, that was the way it ended.â€

â€œand you have doubtless brought all your papers with you?â€ said monte

â€œwhat papers?â€

of your childâ€™s birth.â€

â€œyour excellency, i regret to say that, not knowing it was necessary to
come provided with these papers, i neglected to bring them.â€

â€œthat is unfortunate,â€ returned monte cristo.

â€œwere they, then, so necessary?â€

â€œthey were indispensable.â€

the major passed his hand across his brow. â€œah, _perbacco_,
indispensable, were they?â€

â€œcertainly they were; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the
validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child?â€

â€œtrue,â€ said the major, â€œthere might be doubts raised.â€

â€œin that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated.â€

â€œit would be fatal to his interests.â€

â€œit might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance.â€

happily, the abbÃ© busoni thought for you.â€

â€œhe is extremely prudent and thoughtful.â€

â€œhere they are.â€

the major clasped his hands in token of admiration. â€œyou married oliva
corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte-cattini; here is the
priestâ€™s certificate.â€

â€œyes indeed, there it is truly,â€ said the italian, looking on with
astonishment.

â€œand here is andrea cavalcantiâ€™s baptismal register, given by the curÃ©
of saravezza.â€

â€œall quite correct.â€

â€œtake these documents, then; they do not concern me. you will give them
to your son, who will, of course, take great care of them.â€

â€œi should think so, indeed! if he were to lose them----â€

â€œwell, and if he were to lose them?â€ said monte cristo.

â€œin that case,â€ replied the major, â€œit would be necessary to write to

â€œi regard them as invaluable.â€

â€œnow,â€ said monte cristo â€œas to the mother of the young man----â€

â€œas to the mother of the young man----â€ repeated the italian, with
anxiety.

â€œas regards the marchesa corsinari----â€

â€œreally,â€ said the major, â€œdifficulties seem to thicken upon us; will
she be wanted in any way?â€

â€œno, sir,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œbesides, has she not----â€

â€œyes, sir,â€ said the major, â€œshe has----â€

â€œpaid the last debt of nature?â€


â€œalas, yes,â€ returned the italian.

â€œthat is reasonable, since he is an only son.â€

â€œwell, now that all is arranged, do not let these newly awakened
remembrances be forgotten. you have, doubtless, already guessed that i
was preparing a surprise for you?â€

â€œan agreeable one?â€ asked the italian.

â€œah, i see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his
heart.â€

â€œhum!â€ said the major.

â€œsomeone has told you the secret; or, perhaps, you guessed that he was
here.â€

â€œthat who was here?â€

â€œyour child--your son--your andrea!â€

â€œi did guess it,â€ replied the major with the greatest possible coolness.

â€œnonsense, i am going to set you an example of confidence, they give me
50,000 francs a year to be your son; consequently, you can understand
that it is not at all likely i shall ever deny my parent.â€ the major
looked anxiously around him. â€œmake yourself easy, we are quite alone,â€
 said andrea; â€œbesides, we are conversing in italian.â€

â€œwell, then,â€ replied the major, â€œthey paid me 50,000 francs down.â€

â€œi used not to do so, but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith
in them.â€

â€œyou have, then, been induced to alter your opinion; you have had some

â€œdear valentine!â€

â€œthat will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed
between me and eugÃ©nie, as in speaking of the man whom i could not love,
my thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were
fixed.â€

â€œah, how good you are to say so, valentine! you possess a quality which
can never belong to mademoiselle danglars. it is that indefinable charm
which is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the
fruit, for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek.â€

â€œit is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light.â€

â€œno, valentine, i assure you such is not the case. i was observing you

all wishing to depreciate the beauty of mademoiselle danglars,

valentine started. â€œa friend, maximilian; and who is this friend? i
tremble to give my permission.â€

â€œlisten, valentine. have you never experienced for anyone that sudden
and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had
been your old and familiar friend, though, in reality, it was the first
time you had ever met? nay, further, have you never endeavored to recall
the time, place, and circumstances of your former intercourse, and
failing in this attempt, have almost believed that your spirits must
have held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to
the present, and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the
past?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwell, that is precisely the feeling which i experienced when i first
saw that extraordinary man.â€

him when he was there, all the old manâ€™s happiness was centred in his
granddaughter. valentine, by means of her love, her patience, and her
devotion, had learned to read in noirtierâ€™s look all the varied feelings
which were passing in his mind. to this dumb language, which was so
unintelligible to others, she answered by throwing her whole soul into
the expression of her countenance, and in this manner were the
conversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless
invalid, whose body could scarcely be called a living one, but who,
nevertheless, possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration, united with
a will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly
incapable of obeying its impulses. valentine had solved the problem, and
was able easily to understand his thoughts, and to convey her own in
return, and, through her untiring and devoted assiduity, it was seldom
that, in the ordinary transactions of every-day life, she failed to
anticipate th

e wishes of the living, thinking mind, or the wants of the
almost inanimate body. as to the servant, he had, as we have said, been
with his master for five and twenty years, therefore he knew all his
habits, and it was seldom that noirtier found it necessary to ask for
anything, so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of
the invalid. villefort did not need the help of either valentine or the
domestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation
which he was about to begin. as we have said, he perfectly understood
the old manâ€™s vocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it was
only indifference and _ennui_ which prevented him from so doing. he
therefore allowed valentine to go into the garden, sent away barrois,
and after having seated himself at his fatherâ€™s right hand, while madame
de villefort

madame de villefort and i have a communication to make to you.â€

noirtierâ€™s face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,
while, on the contrary, villefortâ€™s eye was endeavoring to penetrate
into the inmost recesses of the old manâ€™s heart.

â€œthis communication,â€ continued the procureur, in that cold and decisive
tone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, â€œwill, we are
sure, meet with your approbation.â€ the eye of the invalid still retained
that vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any
knowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind; he listened,
nothing more. â€œsir,â€ resumed villefort, â€œwe are thinking of marrying
valentine.â€ had the old manâ€™s face been moulded in wax it could not have
shown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there. â€œthe
marriage will take place in less than three months,â€ said villefort.
noirtierâ€™s eye still retained its inanimate e

xpression.

madame de villefort now took her part in the conversation and added,--
â€œwe thought this news would possess an interest for you, sir, who have
always entertained a great affection for valentine; it therefore only
now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man for whom she is
destined. it is one of the most desirable connections which could
possibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in society, and
every personal qualification likely to render valentine supremely
happy,--his name, moreover, cannot be wholly unknown to you. it is m.
franz de quesnel, baron dâ€™epinay.â€

while his wife was speaking, villefort had narrowly watched the old
manâ€™s countenance. when madame de villefort pronounced the name of
franz, the pupil of m. noirtierâ€™s eye began to dilate, and his eyelids
trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an
individual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at

provoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, â€œthen shall i
send valentine to you?â€ the old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby
intimating that such was his wish. m. and madame de villefort bowed and
left the room, giving orders that valentine should be summoned to her
grandfatherâ€™s presence, and feeling sure that she would have much to do
to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid. valentine,
with a color still heightened by emotion, entered the room just after
her parents had quitted it. one look was sufficient to tell her that her
grandfather was suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he
was wishing to communicate to her. â€œdear grandpapa,â€ cried she, â€œwhat
has happened? they have vexed you, and you are angry?â€ the paralytic
closed his eyes in token of assent. â€œwho has displeased you? is it my
father?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œmadame de villefort?â€

no.â€

â€œthen you are vexed with the engagement?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwell, listen,â€ said valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and
putting her arm round her grandfatherâ€™s neck, â€œi am vexed, too, for i do
not love m. franz dâ€™epinay.â€ an expression of intense joy illumined the
old manâ€™s eyes. â€œwhen i wished to retire into a convent, you remember
how angry you were with me?â€ a tear trembled in the eye of the invalid.
â€œwell,â€ continued valentine, â€œthe reason of my proposing it was that i
might escape this hateful marriage, which drives me to despair.â€
 noirtierâ€™s breathing came thick and short. â€œthen the idea of this
marriage really grieves you too? ah, if you could but help me--if we
could both together defeat their plan! but you are unable to oppose
them,--you, whose mind is so quick, and whose will is so firm are
nevertheless, as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself. alas,

strange and unexpected demand m. de villefort and his father exchanged
looks. â€œyes,â€ motioned the latter, with a firmness which seemed to
declare that with the help of valentine and his old servant, who both
knew what his wishes were, he was quite prepared to maintain the
contest. â€œdo you wish for a notary?â€ asked villefort.

â€œyes.â€

â€œwhat to do?â€

noirtier made no answer. â€œwhat do you want with a notary?â€ again
repeated villefort. the invalidâ€™s eye remained fixed, by which
expression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable.
â€œis it to do us some ill turn? do you think it is worth while?â€ said
villefort.

â€œstill,â€ said barrois, with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant,
â€œif m. noirtier asks for a notary, i suppose he really wishes for a
notary; therefore i shall go at once and fetch one.â€ barrois
acknowledged no master but noirtier, and never allowed his desires in
any way to be contradicted.

es to refuse my request.â€

â€œyou shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir,â€ said
villefort; â€œbut i shall explain to him your state of health, and make
excuses for you, for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous
one.â€

â€œnever mind that,â€ said barrois; â€œi shall go and fetch a notary,
nevertheless,â€--and the old servant departed triumphantly on his
mission.



chapter 59. the will

as soon as barrois had left the room, noirtier looked at valentine with
a malicious expression that said many things. the young girl perfectly
understood the look, and so did villefort, for his countenance became
clouded, and he knitted his eyebrows angrily. he took a seat, and
quietly awaited the arrival of the notary. noirtier saw him seat himself
with an appearance of perfect indifference, at the same time giving a
side look at valentine, which made her understand that she also was to
remain in the room. three-quarters of an hour after, barrois returned,
bringing the n

otary with him. â€œsir,â€ said villefort, after the first
salutations were over, â€œyou were sent for by m. noirtier, whom you see
here. all his limbs have become completely paralysed, he has lost his
voice also, and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch
some fragments of his meaning.â€ noirtier cast an appealing look on
valentine, which look was at once so earnest and imperative, that she
answered immediately. â€œsir,â€ said she, â€œi perfectly understand my
grandfatherâ€™s meaning at all times.â€

â€œthat is quite true,â€ said barrois; â€œand that is what i told the
gentleman as we walked along.â€

â€œpermit me,â€ said the notary, turning first to villefort and then to
valentine--â€œpermit me to state that the case in question is just one of
those in which a public officer like myself cannot pr

without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility. the first thing
necessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be

approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the
object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me,

retire. an imperceptible smile of triumph was expr

essed on the lips of
the procureur. noirtier looked at valentine with an expression so full
of grief, that she arrested the departure of the notary. â€œsir,â€ said
she, â€œthe language which i speak with my grandfather may be easily
learnt, and i can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it almost as
well as i can myself. will you tell me what you require, in order to set
your conscience quite at ease on the subject?â€

â€œin order to render an act valid, i must be certain of the approbation
or disapprobation of my client. illness of body would not affect the
validity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite.â€

â€œwell, sir, by the help of two signs, with which i will acquaint you
presently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather
is still in the full possession of all his mental faculties. m.
noirtier, being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey
his meaning by closing his eyes when he wish

valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she repeated, â€œwa--we--wiâ€--
the old man stopped her at the last syllable. valentine then took the
dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned over the pages.
she passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when she came to the
word â€œwill,â€ m. noirtierâ€™s eye bade her stop. â€œwill,â€ said the notary;
â€œit is very evident that m. noirtier is desirous of making his will.â€

â€œyes, yes, yes,â€ motioned the invalid.

â€œreally, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,â€ said the
astonished notary, turning to m. de villefort. â€œyes,â€ said the
procureur, â€œand i think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary,
for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of
valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as too much interested in
its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure
and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.â€

â€œno, no, no,â€

 replied the eye of the paralytic.

â€œwhat?â€ said villefort, â€œdo you mean to say that valentine is not
interested in your will?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œsir,â€ said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and who
had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this
extraordinary and picturesque scene, â€œwhat appeared so impossible to me
an hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may be
a perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven
witnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the
presence of the witnesses. as to the time, it will not require very much
more than the generality of wills. there are certain forms necessary to
be gone through, and which are always the same. as to the details, the
greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find
the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having had the
management of them, can

i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity, therefore,
one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom, will assist
in the dictation of the testament. are you satisfied, sir?â€ continued
the notary, addressing the old man.


â€œyes,â€ looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the ready
interpretation of his meaning.

â€œwhat is he going to do?â€ thought villefort, whose position demanded
much reserve, but who was longing to know what his fatherâ€™s intentions
were. he left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent, but
barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his masterâ€™s wishes,
and had already gone to fetch one. the procureur then told his wife to
come up. in the course of a quarter of an hour everyone ha

â€œyes.â€

â€œhave you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œi will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation; you
will stop me when i reach the one representing the amount of your own
possessions?â€

â€œyes.â€ there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation. never had
the struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now, and if
it was not a sublime, it was, at least, a curious spectacle. they had
formed a circle round the invalid; the second notary was sitting at a
table, prepared for writing, and his colleague was standing before the
testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have
alluded. â€œyour fortune exceeds 300,000 francs, does it not?â€ asked he.
noirtier made a sign that it did. â€œdo you possess 400,000 francs?â€
 inquired the notary. noirtierâ€™s eye remained immovable.

â€œfive hundred thousand?â€ the same expression continued.

â€œ600,000--700,000--800,000--900,000?â€

which you deprive me; you still leave me the love which i have always

â€œah, yes, most assuredly,â€ said the eyes of the paralytic, for he closed
them with an expression which valentine could not mistake. â€œthank you,
thank you,â€ murmured she. the old manâ€™s declaration that valentine was
not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of
madame de villefort; she gradually approached the invalid, and said:
â€œthen, doubtless, dear m. noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune to
your grandson, edward de villefort?â€ the winking of the eyes which
answered this speech was most decided and terrible, and expressed a
feeling almost amounting to hatred.

â€œno?â€ said the notary; â€œthen, perhaps, it is to your son, m. de
villefort?â€

â€œno.â€ the two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and
inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator. villefort

t you told me something of that kind.â€

â€œmy father has been a jacobin more than anything else,â€ said villefort,
carried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; â€œand the senatorâ€™s
robe, which napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to disguise the
old man without in any degree changing him. when my father conspired, it
was not for the emperor, it was against the bourbons; for m. noirtier
possessed this peculiarity, he never projected any utopian schemes which
could never be realized, but strove for possibilities, and he applied to
the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the
mountain,--theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed
necessary to bring about the desired result.â€

â€œwell,â€ said monte cristo, â€œit is just as i thought; it was politics
which brought noirtier and m. dâ€™epinay into personal contact. although
general dâ€™epinay served under napoleon, did he not still retain royalist
sentiments? and was he not the person

p my word with him. besides, he knows that valentine is rich
in right of her mother, and that she will, in all probability, inherit
the fortune of m. and madame de saint-mÃ©ran, her motherâ€™s parents, who
both love her tenderly.â€

â€œand who are fully as well worth loving and tending as m. noirtier,â€
 said madame de villefort; â€œbesides, they are to come to paris in about a
month, and valentine, after the affront she has received, need not
consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up
with m. noirtier.â€ the count listened with satisfaction to this tale of
wounded self-love and defeated ambition. â€œbut it seems to me,â€ said
monte cristo, â€œand i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am
about to say, that if m. noirtier disinherits mademoiselle de villefort
because she is going to marry a man whose father he detested, he cannot
have the same cause of complaint against this dear edward.â€

mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch, hired for twelve hundred
francs a year, and employed all day, not in studying the heavens like an
astronomer, or in gazing on the water like an angler, or even in
enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him, but all his
monotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied, black-clawed
fellow insect, four or five leagues distant from him. at length i felt a
desire to study this living chrysalis more closely, and to endeavor to
understand the secret part played by these insect-actors when they
occupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string.â€

â€œyes; should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain
to you----â€

â€œno,â€ said monte cristo; â€œsince, as i told you before, i do not wish to
comprehend it. the moment i understand it there will no longer exist a
telegraph for me; it will be nothing more than a sign from m. duchÃ¢tel,
or from m. montalivet, transmitted to the prefect of bayonne, mystified
by two greek words, _tÃªle_, _graphein_. it is the insect with black
claws, and the awful word which i wish to retain in my imagination in
all its purity and all its importance.â€

â€œgo then; for in the course of two hours it will be dark, and you will
not be able to see anything.â€

â€œfatality!â€

â€œhalf-past six oâ€™clock has just struck, m. bertuccio,â€ said the count
severely; â€œi ordered dinner at that hour, and i do not like to wait;â€

leagues beyond st. petersburg, the other five leagues from naples. is it
not amusing to see them both on the same table?â€

â€œwhat are the two fish?â€ asked danglars.

â€œm. chÃ¢teau-renaud, who has lived in russia, will tell you the name of

â€œbut how could you have these fish brought to france?â€

â€œoh, nothing more easy. each fish was brought over in a cask--one filled
with river herbs and weeds, the other with rushes and lake plants; they
were placed in a wagon built on purpose, and thus the sterlet lived
twelve days, the lamprey eight, and both were alive when my cook seized
them, killing one with milk and the other with wine. you do not believe
me, m. danglars!â€

â€œoh, do not give me credit for this, madame; it was done by the romans,
who much esteemed them, and pliny relates that they sent slaves from
ostia to rome, who carried on their heads fish which he calls the
_mulus_, and which, from the description, must probably be the goldfish.
it was also considered a luxury to have them alive, it being an amusing
sight to see them die, for, when dying, they change color three or four
times, and like the rainbow when it disappears, pass through all the
prismatic shades, after which they were sent to the kitchen. their agony
formed part of their merit--if they were not seen alive, they were
despised when dead.â€

staircase.

â€œno, no,â€ she answered, â€œi would rather remain here.â€

â€œare you really frightened, madame?â€ said monte cristo.

â€œoh, no, sir,â€ said madame danglars; â€œbut you suppose scenes in a manner
which gives them the appearance of reality.â€


â€œah, yes,â€ said monte cristo smiling; â€œit is all a matter of
imagination. why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest
mother? and this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the goddess
lucina? and that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not to
disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father

hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he was in the society of
some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir. he
contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond which shone on

any accident happening to his bank-notes, had immediately converted them
into an available asset. then, after dinner, on the pretext of business,

they give them any fortune?â€

a gold mine, one of the noblest families in tuscany, who, when his sons

revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his
dagger? it was therefore necessary, before everything else, and at all
risks, that i should cause all traces of the past to disappear--that i
should destroy every material vestige; too much reality would always
remain in my recollection. it was for this i had annulled the lease--it
was for this i had come--it was for this i was waiting. night arrived; i
allowed it to become quite dark. i was without a light in that room;
when the wind shook all the doors, behind which i continually expected
to see some spy concealed, i trembled. i seemed everywhere to hear your
moans behind me in the bed, and i dared not turn around. my heart beat
so violently that i feared my wound would open. at lengt

â€˜why,â€™ said i, â€˜should that man have carried away the corpse?â€™â€

â€œbut you said,â€ replied madame danglars, â€œhe would require it as a
proof.â€

â€œah, no, madame, that could not be. dead bodies are not kept a year;
they are shown to a magistrate, and the evidence is taken. now, nothing
of the kind has happened.â€

â€œwhat then?â€ asked hermine, trembling violently.

â€œsomething more terrible, more fatal, more alarming for us--the child
was, perhaps, alive, and the assassin may have saved it!â€

madame danglars uttered a piercing cry, and, seizing villefortâ€™s hands,
exclaimed, â€œmy child was alive?â€ said she; â€œyou buried my child alive?
you were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it? ah----â€

madame danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands
she wrung in her feeble grasp. â€œi know not; i merely suppose so, as i
might suppose anything else,â€ replied villefort with a look so fixed, it
indicated that hi

â€œhow i have called him in my long sleepless nights; how i have longed
for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men,
and to find mine among them! at last, one day, when for the hundredth
time i took up my spade, i asked myself again and again what the
corsican could have done with the child. a child encumbers a fugitive;
perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive, he had thrown it into the
river.â€

â€œimpossible!â€ cried madame danglars: â€œa man may murder another out of
revenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child.â€

â€œperhaps,â€ continued villefort, â€œhe had put it in the foundling
hospital.â€

â€œoh, yes, yes,â€ cried the baroness; â€œmy child is there!â€

the 20th of september--a child had been brought there, wrapped in part

danglars returned in another cab to the passage, on the other side of
which she found her carriage, and her coachman sleeping peacefully on
his box while waiting for her.



chapter 68. a summer ball

the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the
procureur, a travelling-carriage entered the rue du helder, passed
through the gateway of no. 27, and stopped in the yard. in a moment the
door was opened, and madame de morcerf alighted, leaning on her sonâ€™s
arm. albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his
toilet, drove to the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es, to the house of monte cristo. the
count received him with his habitual smile. it was a strange thing that
no one ever appeared to advance a step in that manâ€™s favor. those who
would, as it were, force a passage to his heart, found an impassable
barrier. morcerf, who ran towards him with open arms, was chilled as he
drew near, in spite of the friendly smile

shock; you have either been working for me or thinking of me.â€

â€œpossibly,â€ said monte cristo, â€œi have indeed thought of you, but the
magnetic wire i was guiding acted, indeed, without my knowledge.â€

â€œindeed? pray tell me how it happened?â€

â€œwillingly. m. danglars dined with me.â€

â€œi know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and i left town.â€


â€œbut he met here m. andrea cavalcanti.â€

â€œyour italian prince?â€

â€œyes, calls himself.â€

â€œis he not a count?â€

â€œhow will that affect you, since mademoiselle danglars was not among the

â€œi have no fear of that; or, if she did, it was only in the same way in
which i think of her.â€

â€œtouching sympathy! so you hate each other?â€ said the count.

â€œlisten,â€ said morcerf--â€œif mademoiselle danglars were disposed to take
pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and would dispense with
all matrimonial formalities between our two families, i am ready to
agree to the arrangement. in a word, mademoiselle danglars would make a
charming mistress--but a wife--_diable!_â€

â€œand this,â€ said monte cristo, â€œis your opinion of your intended
spouse?â€

â€œyes; it is rather unkind, i acknowledge, but it is true. but as this
dream cannot be realized, since mademoiselle danglars must become my
lawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and
music within ten paces of me, and that for m

rue fontaine-saint-george. he was one of those english tourists who
consume a large fortune in travelling. he hired the apartment in which
he lived furnished, passed only a few hours in the day there, and rarely
slept there. one of his peculiarities was never to speak a word of
french, which he however wrote with great facility.â€

the day after this important information had been given to the kingâ€™s
attorney, a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the rue fÃ©rou,
and rapping at an olive-green door, asked if the abbÃ© busoni were
within. â€œno, he went out early this morning,â€ replied the valet.

â€œi might not always be content with that answer,â€ replied the visitor,
â€œfor i come from one to whom everyone must be at home. but have the
kindness to give the abbÃ© busoni----â€

â€œi told you he was not at home,â€ repeated the valet. â€œthen on his return

â€œyes, sirâ€ replied the stranger with a slight hesitation, and blushing.

the abbÃ© replaced the large spectacles, which covered not only his eyes
but his temples, and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the
same. â€œi am at your service, sir,â€ said the abbÃ©, with a marked italian
accent.

â€œthe mission with which i am charged, sir,â€ replied the visitor,
speaking with hesitation, â€œis a confidential one on the part of him who

him straight to the house of m. de villefort. an hour afterwards the
carriage was again ordered, and this time it went to the rue fontaine-

stranger had written to lord wilmore, requesting an interview, which the
latter had fixed for ten oâ€™clock. as the envoy of the prefect of police
arrived ten minutes before ten, he was told that lord wilmore, who was
precision and punctuality personified, was not yet come in, but that he
would be sure to return as the clock struck.

the visitor was introduced into the drawing-room, which was like all
other furnished drawing-rooms. a mantle-piece, with two modern sÃ¨vres
vases, a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow, a mirror with
an engraving on each side--one representing homer carrying his guide,
the other, belisarius begging--a grayish paper; red and black tapestry--
such was the appearance of lord wilmoreâ€™s drawing

an blinds. at this moment the garden
was only occupied by about ten servants, who had just received orders
from their mistress to prepare the supper, the serenity of the weather
continuing to increase. until now, it had been undecided whether the
supper should take place in the dining-room, or under a long tent
erected on the lawn, but the beautiful blue sky, studded with stars, had
settled the question in favor of the lawn. the gardens were illuminated
with colored lanterns, according to the italian custom, and, as is usual
in countries where the luxuries of the table--the rarest of all luxuries
in their complete form--are well understood, the supper-table was loaded
with wax-lights and flowers.


at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms, after giving
her orders, many guests were arriving, more attracted by the charming
hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the
count; for, owing to the good taste of mercÃ©dÃ¨s, one was sure of finding

â€œyes.â€

â€œhe is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents to
the idea of providing the chamber of peers with a uniform. he was very
successful upon that question. he stood badly with the liberal papers,
but his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him
into favor with the journalists. they talk of making him an ambassador.â€


â€œand what are his claims to the peerage?â€

â€œhe has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five
articles in the _siÃ¨cle_, and voted five or six years on the ministerial
side.â€

 replied monte cristo, as if the subject had not been mentioned before.
the countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket, with a gesture
of despair. â€œinflexible man!â€ she murmured. monte cristo remained as
unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him. albert at this
moment ran in. â€œoh, mother,â€ he exclaimed, â€œsuch a misfortune has
happened!â€

â€œwhat? what has happened?â€ asked the countess, as though awakening from
a sleep to the realities of life; â€œdid you say a misfortune? indeed, i
should expect misfortunes.â€

â€œm. de villefort is here.â€

â€œwell?â€

â€œhe comes to fetch his wife and daughter.â€

â€œwhy so?â€

â€œbecause madame de saint-mÃ©ran is just arrived in paris, bringing the
news of m. de saint-mÃ©ranâ€™s death, which took place on the first stage
after he left marseilles. madame de villefort, who was in very good
spirits, would neither believe nor think of the misfortune, but

â€œmademoiselle valentine?â€ noirtier nodded his head. â€œshe is at the ball,
as you know, since she came to say good-bye to you in full dress.â€
 noirtier again closed his left eye. â€œdo you wish to see her?â€ noirtier
again made an affirmative sign. â€œwell, they have gone to fetch her, no
doubt, from madame de morcerfâ€™s; i will await her return, and beg her to
come up here. is that what you wish for?â€

â€œyes,â€ replied the invalid.

barrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for valentine, and informed
her of her grandfatherâ€™s wish. consequently, valentine came up to
noirtier, on leaving madame de saint-mÃ©ran, who in the midst of her
grief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep.
within reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a
bottle of orangeade, her usual beverage, and a glass. then, as we have

bedside of her grandmother. the poor child appeared herself to require
the doctor she had recommended to her aged relative. a bright spot
burned in either cheek, her respiration was short and difficult, and her
pulse beat with feverish excitement. she was thinking of the despair of
maximilian, when he should be informed that madame de saint-mÃ©ran,
instead of being an ally, was unconsciously acting as his enemy. more
than once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother, and she would
not have hesitated a moment, if maximilian morrel had been named albert
de morcerf or raoul de chÃ¢teau-renaud; but morrel was of plebeian
extraction, and valentine knew how the haughty marquise de saint-mÃ©ran
despised all who were not noble. her secret had each time been repressed
when she was about to reveal it, by the sad conviction that it would be
useless to do so; for, were it once discovered by her father and mother,
all would be lost. two hours p

astonished, then the voice reached her ear more distinctly, and she
recognized it to be that of maximilian.



chapter 73. the promise

it was, indeed, maximilian morrel, who had passed a wretched existence
since the previous day. with the instinct peculiar to lovers he had
anticipated after the return of madame de saint-mÃ©ran and the death of
the marquis, that something would occur at m. de villefortâ€™s in
connection with his attachment for valentine. his presentiments were
realized, as we shall see, and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him
pale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut-trees. valentine was
ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety, and as it was not his
accustomed hour for visiting her, she had gone to the spot simply by
accident or perhaps through sympathy. morrel called her, and she ran to
the gate. â€œyou here at this hour?â€ said she. â€œyes, my poor girl,â€
 replied morrel; â€œi come to bring and to hear bad tidings.â€

â€œthis is, i

ssible!â€™â€

â€œyou will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even
attempting to contend with it?â€ said morrel sorrowfully.

â€œyes,--if i die!â€

â€œwell, valentine,â€ resumed maximilian, â€œi can only say again that you
are right. truly, it is i who am mad, and you prove to me that passion
blinds the most well-meaning. i appreciate your calm reasoning. it is
then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably promised to m.

heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract,

plunge the dagger into the wound! what would you do, tell me, if your
sister listened to such a proposition?â€

have already said so--and as a selfish man i think not of what others

and pressed his burning forehead against the fence. had valentine
fainted? or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight? these
were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man.

the idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape, and
that she had fainted in one of the paths, was the one that most
impressed itself upon his mind. â€œin that case,â€ said he, â€œi should lose
her, and by my own fault.â€ he dwelt on this idea for a moment, then it
appeared reality. he even thought he could perceive something on the
ground at a distance; he ventured to call, and it seemed to him that the
wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh.

at last the half-hour struck. it was impossible to wait longer, his
temples throbbed violently, his eyes were growing dim; he passed one leg
over the wall, and in a moment leaped down on the other side. he was on
villefortâ€™s premises--had arrived there by scaling the wall. what might
be the consequences? however, he had n

 a shadow was seen for one moment on
the balcony. morrel shuddered; he thought he heard a sob.

it cannot be wondered at that his mind, generally so courageous, but now
disturbed by the two strongest human passions, love and fear, was
weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts. although it
was impossible that valentine should see him, hidden as he was, he
thought he heard the shadow at the window call him; his disturbed mind
told him so. this double error became an irresistible reality, and by
one of the incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his
hiding-place, and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the
risk of alarming valentine, at the risk of being discovered by some
exclamation which might escape the young girl, he crossed the flower-
garden, which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake, and
having passed the rows of orange-trees which extended in front of the
house, he reached the step, ran quickly up and pushed the door, which

â€œyes.â€

â€œbut the contract?â€ the same smile returned. â€œwill you assure me it
shall not be signed?â€

â€œyes,â€ said noirtier.

â€œthe contract shall not be signed!â€ cried morrel. â€œoh, pardon me, sir; i
can scarcely realize so great a happiness. will they not sign it?â€

â€œno,â€ said the paralytic. notwithstanding that assurance, morrel still
hesitated. this promise of an impotent old man was so strange that,
instead of being the result of the power of his will, it might emanate
from enfeebled organs. is it not natural that the madman, ignorant of
his folly, should attempt things beyond his power? the weak man talks of

â€œand this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin,

â€œthat is a tenacious old grandfather,â€ said beauchamp. â€œ_tenacem

outlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed. he resembles
the old conventionalist of â€˜93, who said to napoleon, in 1814, â€˜you bend

the feeling of m. noirtier towards his grandchild, and that he

to alienate a part of his fortune, and having alienated it all, the will

andrea had, then, in a fortnight, attained a very fair position. he was
called count, he was said to possess 50,000 livres per annum; and his
fatherâ€™s immense riches, buried in the quarries of saravezza, were a
constant theme. a learned man, before whom the last circumstance was
mentioned as a fact, declared he had seen the quarries in question,
which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful, but
which now assumed the garb of reality.

laughing.

second a private door opened, and ali appeared, bringing two chibouques
filled with excellent latakia. â€œit is quite wonderful,â€ said albert.

â€œoh no, it is as simple as possible,â€ replied monte cristo. â€œali knows i
generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee; he has heard that i
ordered tea, and he also knows that i brought you home with me; when i
summoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so, and as he
comes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through
the medium of smoking, he

â€œyou are right; and she is one of the greatest in her country too.â€

â€œi thought so. but how did it happen that such a great princess became a
slave?â€

â€œhow was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster? the fortune
of war, my dear viscount,--the caprice of fortune; that is the way in
which these things are to be accounted for.â€

â€œand is her name a secret?â€

â€œas regards the generality of mankind it is; but not for you, my dear
viscount, who are one of my most intimate friends, and on whose silence
i feel i may rely, if i consider it necessary to enjoin it--may i not do
so?â€

â€œcertainly; on my word of honor.â€

â€œyou know the history of the pasha of yanina, do you not?â€

â€œof ali tepelini? [*] oh, yes; it was in his service that my father made
his fortune.â€

â€œtrue, i had forgotten that.â€

in arms he became almost supreme ruler of albania, epirus, and adjacent
territory. having aroused the enmity of the sultan, he was proscribed
and put to death by treachery in 1822, at the age of eighty.--ed.

â€œwell, what is haydÃ©e to ali tepelini?â€

â€œmerely his daughter.â€

â€œwhat? the daughter of ali pasha?â€

â€œof ali pasha and the beautiful vasiliki.â€

â€œand your slave?â€

â€œ_ma foi_, yes.â€

â€œbut how did she become so?â€

â€œwhy, simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day, as i
was passing through the market at constantinople.â€

â€œwonderful! really, my dear count, you seem to throw a sort of magic

â€œi accept them at once.â€

â€œthe first is, that you will never tell anyone that i have granted the

â€œvery well,â€ said albert, extending his hand; â€œi swear i will not.â€

â€œthe second is, that you will not tell her that your father ever served
hers.â€

â€œi give you my oath that i will not.â€

â€œenough, viscount; you will remember those two vows, will you not? but i
know you to be a man of honor.â€ the count again struck the gong. ali
reappeared. â€œtell haydÃ©e,â€ said he, â€œthat i will take coffee with her,
and give her to understand that i desire permission to present one of my
friends to her.â€ ali bowed and left the room. â€œnow, understand me,â€ said
the count, â€œno direct questions, my dear morcerf; if you wish to know
anything, tell me, and i will ask her.â€

â€œagreed.â€ ali reappeared for the third time, and drew back the
tapestried hanging which concealed the door, to signify to his master
and albert that t

albert passed his hand through his hair, and curled his moustache, then,
having satisfied himself as to his personal appearance, followed the
count into the room, the latter having previously resumed his hat and
gloves. ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard, and the door was
kept by the three french attendants, commanded by myrto.

haydÃ©e was awaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments,
which was the drawing-room. her large eyes were dilated with surprise
and expectation, for it was the first time that any man, except monte
cristo, had been accorded an entrance into her presence. she was sitting
on a sofa placed in an angle of the room, with her legs crossed under
her in the eastern fashion,

monte cristo turned to albert. â€œdo you know modern greek,â€ asked he.

â€œalas! no,â€ said albert; â€œnor even ancient greek, my dear count; never
had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself.â€

â€œthen,â€ said haydÃ©e, proving by her remark that she had quite understood
monte cristoâ€™s question and albertâ€™s answer, â€œthen i will speak either
in french or italian, if my lord so wills it.â€

monte cristo reflected one instant. â€œyou will speak in italian,â€ said
he. then, turning towards albert,--â€œit is a pity you do not understand
either ancient or modern greek, both of which haydÃ©e speaks so fluently;
the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in italian, which will
give you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation.â€ the count
made a sign to haydÃ©e to address his visitor. â€œsir,â€ she said to
morcerf, â€œyou are most welcome

 this was said in excellent tuscan, and with that soft roman accent which
makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer. then, turning
to ali, she directed him to bring coffee and pipes, and when he had left
the room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned albert
to approach nearer to her. monte cristo and morcerf drew their seats
towards a small table, on which were arranged music, drawings, and vases
of flowers. ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques; as to m.
baptistin, this portion of the building was interdicted to him. albert
refused the pipe which the nubian offered him. â€œoh, take it--take it,â€
 said the count; â€œhaydÃ©e is almost as civilized as a parisian; the smell
of a havana is disagreeable to her, but the tobacco of the east is a
most delicious perfume, you know.â€

ali left the room. the cups of coffee were all prepared, with the
addition of sugar, which had been brought for albe

haydÃ©e took the beverage in the original arabian manner, that is to say,

fingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness
of a child when eating or drinking something which it likes. at this
moment two women entered, bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet,
which they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose. â€œmy
dear host, and you, signora,â€ said albert, in italian, â€œexcuse my
apparent stupidity. i am quite bewildered, and it is natural that it
should be so. here i am in the heart of paris; but a moment ago i heard
the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the
lemonade-sellers, and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to
the east; not such as i have seen it, but such as my dreams have painted
it. oh, signora, if i could but speak greek, your conversation, added to
the fairy-scene which surrounds me, would furnish an evenin

â€œi speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you, sir,â€
 said haydÃ©e quietly; â€œand if you like what is eastern, i will do my best
to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here.â€

â€œon what subject shall i converse with her?â€ said albert, in a low tone
to monte cristo.

â€œjust what you please; you may speak of her country and of her youthful
reminiscences, or if you like it better you can talk of rome, naples, or

of the scimitar attached to his girdle. then from time to time there
came to him an albanian who said something to which i paid no attention,
but which he always answered in the same tone of voice, either â€˜kill,â€™
or â€˜pardon.â€™â€

â€œit is very strange,â€ said albert, â€œto hear such words proceed from the
mouth of anyone but an actress on the stage, and one needs constantly to
be saying to oneâ€™s self, â€˜this is no fiction, it is all reality,â€™ in
order to believe it. and how does france appear in your eyes, accustomed
as they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes?â€

â€œi think it is a fine country,â€ said haydÃ©e, â€œbut i see france as it
really is, because i look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my own
country, which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my
childish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere, which is

obeisance. as for me, it made me tremble. this voice was that of my
father. he came last, clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his
hand the carbine which your emperor presented him. he was leaning on the
shoulder of his favorite selim, and he drove us all before him, as a
shepherd would his straggling flock. my father,â€ said haydÃ©e, raising
her head, â€œwas that illustrious man known in europe under the name of
ali tepelini, pasha of yanina, and before whom turkey trembled.â€

albert, without knowing why, started on hearing these words pronounced
with such a haughty and dignified accent; it appeared to him as if there
was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which
gleamed from the brilliant eyes of haydÃ©e at this moment; she appeared
like a pythoness evoking a spectre, as she recalled to his mind the
remembrance of the fearful death of this man, to the news of which all

€œfrom where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank
mass; it was the kiosk to which we were going. this kiosk appeared to me
to be at a considerable distance, perhaps on account of the darkness of
the night, which prevented any object from being more than partially
discerned. we stepped into the boat. i remember well that the oars made
no noise whatever in striking the water, and when i leaned over to
ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our
palikares. [*] besides the rowers, the boat contained only the women, my
father, mother, selim, and myself. the palikares had remained on the
shore of the lake, ready to cover our retreat; they were kneeling on the
lowest of the marble steps, and in that manner intended making a rampart
of the three others, in case of pursuit. our bark flew before the wind.

who is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which
he is relating. â€œyou were saying, signora,â€ said albert, who was paying
the most implicit attention to the recital, â€œthat the garrison of
yanina, fatigued with long service----â€

â€œhad treated with the seraskier [*] koorshid, who had been sent by the
sultan to gain possession of the person of my father; it was then that
ali tepelini--after having sent to the sultan a french officer in whom
he reposed great confidence--resolved to retire to the asylum which he
had long before prepared for himself, and which he called _kataphygion_,
or the refuge.â€

â€œand this officer,â€ asked albert, â€œdo you remember his name, signora?â€
 monte cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl, which was
quite unperceived by albert. â€œno,â€ said she, â€œi do not remember it just

were conducted. in this place were together 60,000. pouches and 200
barrels; the pouches contained 25,000,000 of money in gold, and the
barrels were filled with 30,000. pounds of gunpowder.

â€œnear the barrels stood selim, my fatherâ€™s favorite, whom i mentioned to
you just now. he stood watch day and night with a lance provided with a
lighted slowmatch in his hand, and he had orders to blow up everything--
kiosk, guards, women, gold, and ali tepelini himself--at the first
signal given by my father. i remember well that the slaves, convinced of
the precarious tenure on which they held their lives, passed whole days
and nights in praying, crying, and groaning. as for me, i can never
forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier, and
whenever the angel of death summons me to another world, i am quite sure
i shall recognize selim. i cannot tell you how long we remained in this
state; at that period i did not even know

ad on his shoulder, and i played at his feet,
admiring everything i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of
childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in
themselves, but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest
importance. the heights of pindus towered above us; the castle of yanina
rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake, and the immense
masses of black vegetation which, viewed in the distance, gave the idea
of lichens clinging to the rocks, were in reality gigantic fir-trees and
myrtles.

â€œone morning my father sent for us; my mother had been crying all the
night, and was very wretched; we found the pasha calm, but paler than
usual. â€˜take courage, vasiliki,â€™ said he; â€˜today arrives the firman of
the master, and my fate will be decided. if my pardon be complete, we
shall return triumphant to yanina; if the news be inauspicious, we must
fly this night.â€™--â€˜but supposing our enemy should not allow us to do
so?â€™ said my mother. â€˜oh,

smiling; â€˜selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter. they

â€œmy mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not
come from my fatherâ€™s heart. she prepared the iced water which he was in
the habit of constantly drinking,--for since his sojourn at the kiosk he
had been parched by the most violent fever,--after which she anointed
his white beard with perfumed oil, and lighted his

trembling perceptibly, â€˜the instant approaches which will decide

vasiliki; â€˜if you die, my lord, i will die with you.â€™--â€˜go to selim!â€™
cried my father. â€˜adieu, my lord,â€™ murmured my mother, determining
quietly to await the approach of death. â€˜take away vasiliki!â€™ said my
father to his palikares.

â€œas for me, i had been forgotten in the general confusion; i ran toward
ali tepelini; he saw me hold out my arms to him, and he stooped down and
pressed my forehead with his lips. oh, how distinctly i remember that
kiss!--it was the last he ever gave me, and i feel as if it were still
warm on my forehead. on descending, we saw through the lattice-work
several boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view.
at first they appeared like black specks, and now they looked lik

skimming the surface of the waves. during this time, in the kiosk at my
fatherâ€™s feet, were seated twenty palikares, concealed from view by an
angle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats.
they were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother-of-pearl and
silver, and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the
floor. my father looked at his watch, and paced up and down with a
countenance expressive of the greatest anguish. this was the scene which
presented itself to my view as i quitted my father after that last kiss.
my mother and i traversed the gloomy passage

€™--â€˜my
friend,â€™ said my mother, â€˜when your masterâ€™s orders arrive, if it is the
poniard which he sends, instead of despatching us by that horrible death
which we both so much dread, you will mercifully kill us with this same
poniard, will you not?â€™--â€˜yes, vasiliki,â€™ replied selim tranquilly.

â€œsuddenly we heard loud cries; and, listening, discerned that they were
cries of joy. the name of the french officer who had been sent to
constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our palikares; it was
evident that he brought the answer of the emperor, and that it was
favorable.â€

â€œand do you not remember the frenchmanâ€™s name?â€ said morcerf, quite
ready to aid the memory of the narrator. monte cristo made a sign to him
to be silent.

â€œi do not recollect it,â€ said haydÃ©e.

â€œthe noise increased; steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer;
they were descending the steps leading to the cavern. selim made ready
his lance. soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight

at the entrance
of the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which
had found their way into this gloomy retreat. â€˜who are you?â€™ cried
selim. â€˜but whoever you may be, i charge you not to advance another
step.â€™--â€˜long live the emperor!â€™ said the figure. â€˜he grants a full
pardon to the vizier ali, and not only gives him his life, but restores
to him his fortune and his possessions.â€™ my mother uttered a cry of joy,
and clasped me to her bosom. â€˜stop,â€™ said selim, seeing that she was
about to go out; â€˜you see i have not yet received the ring,â€™--â€˜true,â€™
said my mother. and she fell on her knees, at the same time holding me
up towards heaven, as if she desired, while praying to god in my behalf,
to raise me actually to his presence.â€

and for the second time haydÃ©e stopped,

monte cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and
presented it to her, saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of
command,--â€œcourage.â€


haydÃ©e dried her eyes, and continued: â€œby this time our eyes, habituated
to the darkness, had recognized the messenger of the pasha,--it was a
friend. selim had also recognized him, but the brave young man only
acknowledged one duty, which was to obey. â€˜in whose name do you come?â€™
said he to him. â€˜i come in the name of our master, ali tepelini.â€™--â€˜if
you come from ali himself,â€™ said selim, â€˜you know what you were charged
to remit to me?â€™--â€˜yes,â€™ said the messenger, â€˜and i bring you his ring.â€™
at these words he raised his hand above his head, to show the token; but
it was too far off, and there was not light enough to enable selim,
where he was standing, to distinguish and recognize the object presented
to his view. â€˜i do not see what you have in your hand,â€™ said selim.
â€˜approach then,â€™ said the mess

characters of gold. â€˜what we want,â€™ replied one, â€˜is to communicate to
you the will of his highness. do you see this firman?â€™--â€˜i do,â€™ said my
father. â€˜well, read it; he demands your head.â€™


â€œmy father answered with a loud laugh, which was more frightful than
even threats would have been, and he had not ceased when two reports of
a pistol were heard; he had fired them himself, and had killed two men.
the palikares, who were prostrated at my fatherâ€™s feet, now sprang up
and fired, and the room was filled with fire and smoke. at the same
instant the firing began on the other side, and the balls penetrated the
boards all round us. oh, how noble did the grand vizier my father look
at that moment, in the midst of the flying bullets, his scimitar in his
hand, and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies! and how he
terrified them, even then, and made them fly before him! â€˜selim, selim!â€™

replied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth, â€˜and
you are lost, ali!â€™ at the same moment an explosion was heard, and the
flooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up
and shivered to atoms--the troops were firing from underneath. three or
four palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds.

â€œmy father howled aloud, plunged his fingers into the holes which the
balls had made, and tore up one of the planks entire. but immediately
through this opening twenty more shots were fired, and the flame,
rushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano, soon reached the
tapestry, which it quickly devoured. in the midst of all this frightful
tumult and these terrific cries, two reports, fearfully distinct,
followed by two shrieks

more heartrending than all, froze me with
terror. these two shots had mortally wounded my father, and it was he
who had given utterance to these frightful cries. however, he remained
standing, clinging to a window. my mother tried to force the door, that
she might go and die with him, but it was fastened on the inside. all
around him were lying the palikares, writhing in convulsive agonies,
while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape
by springing from the windows. at this crisis the whole flooring
suddenly gave way, my father fell on one knee, and at the same moment
twenty hands were thrust forth, armed with sabres, pistols, and
poniards--twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man,
and my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by
these demons, and which seemed like hell itself op

albert looked at her with curiosity, for she had not yet related what he
most desired to know,--how she had become the slave of the count. haydÃ©e
saw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her
two auditors; she exclaimed, â€˜when my mother recovered her senses we
were before the seraskier. â€˜kill,â€™ said she, â€˜but spare the honor of the
widow of ali.â€™--â€˜it is not to me to whom you must address yourself,â€™
said koorshid.

â€œâ€˜to whom, then?â€™--â€˜to your new master.â€™

â€œâ€˜who and where is he?â€™--â€˜he is here.â€™

â€œand koorshid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the
death of my father,â€ said haydÃ©e, in a tone of chastened anger. â€œthen,â€
 said albert, â€œyou became the property of this man?â€


â€œno,â€ replied haydÃ©e, â€œhe did not dare to keep us, so we were sold to

surrounded by a crowd of people, who opened a way for us to pass, when
suddenly my mother, having looked closely at an object which was
attracting their attention, uttered a piercing cry and fell to the
ground, pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the
gates, and beneath which were inscribed these words:

â€˜_this is the head of ali tepelini, pasha of yanina._â€™

â€œi cried bitterly, and tried to raise my mother from the earth, but she

armenian. he caused me to be instructed, gave me masters, and when i was

the next morning, as soon as he awoke, danglars asked for the
newspapers; they were brought to him; he laid aside three or four, and
at last fixed on _lâ€™impartial_, the paper of which beauchamp was the
chief editor. he hastily tore off the cover, opened the journal with
nervous precipitation, passed contemptuously over the paris jottings,
and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence, stopped with a malicious
smile, at a paragraph headed

_we hear from yanina._

â€œvery good,â€ observed danglars, after having read the paragraph; â€œhere

perfectly unnecessary.â€

up his sleeves, and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen
were accustomed to wash their hands after shooting. â€œcome in, my lord,â€
 said philip in a low tone, â€œand i will show you something droll.â€
 morcerf entered, and in place of the usual target, he saw some playing-
cards fixed against the wall. at a distance albert thought it was a
complete suit, for he counted from the ace to the ten. â€œah, ha,â€ said

approached. in fact, the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the
exact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied, the
lines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled
with pencil.

â€œ_diable!_â€ said morcerf.

hands on the towel which ali had brought him; â€œi must occupy my leisure
moments in some way or other. but come, i am waiting for you.â€ both men
entered monte cristoâ€™s carriage, which in the course of a few minutes
deposited them safely at no. 30. monte cristo took albert into his
study, and pointing to a seat, placed another for himself. â€œnow let us
talk the matter over quietly,â€ said the count.

follows:--

â€œa correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we
had remained in ignorance. the castle which formed the protection of the
town was given up to the turks by a french officer named fernand, in
whom the grand vizier, ali tepelini, had reposed the greatest
confidence.â€

â€œwell,â€ said monte cristo, â€œwhat do you see in that to annoy you?â€

â€œwhat do i see in it?â€

â€œyes; what does it signify to you if the castle of yanina was given up
by a french officer?â€

â€œit signifies to my father, the count of morcerf, whose christian name

hence arises the calumny.â€

hat, and left the room. he found his carriage at the door, and doing his
utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp, who was
in his office. it was a gloomy, dusty-looking apartment, such as
journalistsâ€™ offices have always been from time immemorial. the servant
announced m. albert de morcerf. beauchamp repeated the name to himself,
as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright, and then
gave orders for him to be admitted. albert entered. beauchamp uttered an
exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under
foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room. â€œthis way,

beauchamp took the paper, and read the article to which albert pointed
in an undertone. â€œyou see it is a serious annoyance,â€ said morcerf, when
beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph. â€œis the officer

â€œyes,â€ said albert, blushing.

â€œwell, what do you wish me to do for you?â€ said beauchamp mildly.

â€œmy dear beauchamp, i wish you to contradict this statement.â€ beauchamp
looked at albert with a benevolent expression.

felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her
grandfather. but the easy-chair of the old man was heard rolling along
the floor, and he soon made his appearance in the room. noirtier
acknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks
which morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of
valentine and himself--an intervention which had saved them from
despair. morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the
new favor which he designed to bestow on him. valentine was sitting at a
little distance from them, timidly awaiting the moment when she should
be obliged to speak. noirtier fixed his eyes on her. â€œam i to say what
you told me?â€ asked valentine. noirtier made a sign that she was to do
so.

her with the most intense interest, â€œmy grandfather, m. noirtier, had a

of being ready to start from their sockets; his head fell back, and the
lower extremities of the body began to stiffen. valentine uttered a cry
of horror; morrel took her in his arms, as if to defend her from some
unknown danger. â€œm. dâ€™avrigny, m. dâ€™avrigny,â€ cried she, in a stifled
voice. â€œhelp, help!â€ barrois turned round and with a great effort
stumbled a few steps, then fell at the feet of noirtier, and resting his
hand on the knee of the invalid, exclaimed, â€œmy master, my good master!â€
 at this moment m. de villefort, attracted by the noise, appeared on the
threshold. morrel relaxed his hold of valentine, and retreating to a
distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain. pale
as if he had been gazing on a serpent, he fixed his terrified eye on the
agonized sufferer.

noirtier, burning with impatience and terror, was in despair at his
utter inability to help his old domestic, whom he regarded more in the

looked like a second corpse in that chamber of death. â€œoh, death is in

â€œsay, rather, crime!â€ replied the doctor.

â€œm. dâ€™avrigny,â€ cried villefort, â€œi cannot tell you all i feel at this

â€œyes,â€ said m. dâ€™avrigny, with an imposing calmness, â€œbut i think it is

villefort fell on his knees. â€œlisten,â€ said he; â€œi have not the strength

doctor turned pale. â€œdoctor, every son of woman is born to suffer and to

â€œall would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter are
willing. we should command an annuity of 175,000 livres. supposing,
also, i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital, which is not
likely, but still is possible, we would place these two or three
millions in your hands, whose talent might make it realize ten per

â€œi never give more than four per cent, and generally only three and a

profit.â€

â€œvery good, father-in-law,â€ said cavalcanti, yielding to his low-born
nature, which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with
which he sought to conceal it. correcting himself immediately, he said,

the following morning, with the bankerâ€™s usual punctuality, the eighty
thousand francs were placed in the young manâ€™s hands as he was on the
point of starting, after having left two hundred francs for caderousse.

as possible in the evening. but scarcely had he stepped out of his

 andrea went as she directed him, and on the third floor he found a
hareâ€™s paw, which, by the hasty ringing of the bell, it was evident he
pulled with considerable ill-temper. a moment after caderousseâ€™s face
appeared at the grating in the door. â€œah, you are punctual,â€ said he, as
he drew back the door.

â€œconfound you and your punctuality!â€ said andrea, throwing himself into
a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at
the head of his host.

â€œcome, come, my little fellow, donâ€™t be angry. see, i have thought about
you--look at the good breakfast we are going to have; nothing but what
you are fond of.â€ andrea, indeed, inhaled the scent of something cooking

â€œi can still say it is a dream; a retired baker, my poor benedetto, is
rich--he has an annuity.â€

â€œwell, you have an annuity.â€

â€œi have?â€


â€œyes, since i bring you your two hundred francs.â€ caderousse shrugged
his shoulders. â€œit is humiliating,â€ said he, â€œthus to receive money

â€œhow would you realize?â€

â€œi would ask for six monthsâ€™ in advance, under pretence of being able to

showing his teeth, like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling. â€œand,â€
 added he, biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of
bread, â€œi have formed a plan.â€ caderousseâ€™s plans alarmed andrea still

â€œit is not worthwhile.â€

â€œwhy?â€

â€œbecause there is a little secret, a precaution i thought it desirable

â€œthank you,â€ said andrea; â€œi will let you know a week beforehand.â€ they
parted. caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen
andrea go down the three stories, but also cross the court. then he
returned hastily, shut his door carefully, and began to study, like a
clever architect, the plan andrea had left him.

chapter 82. the burglary

the day following that on which the conversation we have related took
place, the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil, accompanied by ali
and several attendants, and also taking with him some horses whose
qualities he was desirous of ascertaining. he was induced to undertake
this journey, of which the day before he had not even thought and which
had not occurred to andrea either, by the arrival of bertuccio from
normandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop. the house was
ready, and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a
small creek with her crew of six men, who had observed all the requisite
formalities and were ready again to put to sea.

the count praised bertuccio

e
letter. â€œimportant and urgent,â€ said he. the count opened the letter,
and read:--

â€œm. de monte cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his
house in the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es with the intention of carrying off some
papers supposed to be in the secretary desk in the dressing-room. the
countâ€™s well-known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the
police, whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this
advice. the count, by any opening from the bedroom, or by concealing
himself in the dressing-room, would be able to defend his property
himself. many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the
villain from the attempt, and m. de monte cristo would lose the
opportunity of discovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who
now sends this warning to the count,--a warning he might not be able to
send another time, if this first attempt should fail and another be
made.â€

the countâ€™s first idea was that this was an artifice--a gross deception,
to

ast noise.â€

â€œby whom?â€

â€œby thieves.â€

â€œyou are a fool, m. baptistin. thieves might strip the house--it would
annoy me less than to be disobeyed.â€ baptistin bowed.


â€œyou understand me?â€ said the count. â€œbring your comrades here, one and
all; but let everything remain as usual, only close the shutters of the
ground floor.â€

â€œand those of the first floor?â€

â€œyou know they are never closed. go!â€

the count signified his intention of dining alone, and that no one but
ali should attend him. having dined with his usual tranquillity and
moderation, the count, making a signal to ali to follow him, went out by
the side-gate and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned, apparently
without design towards paris and at twilight; found himself opposite his
house in the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es. all was dark; one solitary, feeble light
was burning in the porterâ€™s lodge, about forty paces distant from the
house, as baptistin had said. monte cristo leaned against a tree, and
with

that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived, looked up
and down the avenue, examined the passers-by, and carefully looked down
the neighboring streets, to see that no one was concealed. ten minutes
passed thus, and he was convinced that no one was watching him. he
hastened to the side-door with ali, entered hurriedly, and by the
servantsâ€™ staircase, of which he had the key, gained his bedroom without
opening or disarranging a single curtain, without even the porter having
the slightest suspicion that the house, which he supposed empty,
contained its chief occupant.

arrived in his bedroom, the count motioned to ali to stop; then he
passed into the dressing-room, which he examined. everything appeared as
usual--the precious secretary desk in its place, and the key in the
secretary desk. 
 
 ___________________________
 
he double locked it, took the key, returned to the
bedroom door, removed the double staple of the bolt, and went in.
meanwhile ali had procured the arms the count required--namely, a short
carbine and a pair of double-barrelled pistols, with which as sure an
aim might be taken as with a single-barrelled one. thus armed, the count
held the lives of five men in his hands. it was about half-past nine.
the count and ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of
spanish wine; then monte cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels,
which enabled him to see into the adjoining room. he had within his
reach his pistols and carbine, and ali, standing near him, held one of
the small arabian hatchets, whose form has not varied since the
crusades. through one of the windows of the bedroom, on a line with that
in the dressing-room, the count could see into the street.

two hours passed thus. it was intensely

 dark; still ali, thanks to his
wild nature, and the count, thanks doubtless to his long confinement,
could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees.
the little light in the lodge had long been extinct. it might be
expected that the attack, if indeed an attack was projected, would be
made from the staircase of the ground floor, and not from a window; in
monte cristoâ€™s opinion, the villains sought his life, not his money. it
would be his bedroom they would attack, and they must reach it

by the
back staircase, or by the window in the dressing-room. the clock of the
invalides struck a quarter to twelve; the west wind bore on its
moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes.


as the last stroke died away, the count thought he heard a slight noise
in the dressing-room; this first sound, or rather this first grinding,
was followed by a second, then a third; at the fourth, the count knew
what to expect. a firm and well-practised hand was engaged in cutting
the four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond. the count felt his
heart beat more rapidly. inu

red as men may be to danger, forewarned as
they may be of peril, they understand, by the fluttering of the heart
and the shuddering of the frame, the enormous difference between a dream
and a reality, between the project and the execution. however, monte
cristo only made a sign to apprise ali, who, understanding that danger
was approaching from the other side, drew nearer to his master. monte
cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies.

the window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which
the count could see into the dressing-room. he fixed his eyes on that
window--he distinguished a shadow in the darkness; then one of the panes
became quite opaque, as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside,
then the square cracked without falling.
 
 ___________________________
 
 through the opening an arm was
passed to find the fastening, then a second; the window turned on its
hinges, and a man entered. he was alone.

â€œthatâ€™s a daring rascal,â€ whispered the count.

at that moment ali touched him slightly on the shoulder. he turned; ali
pointed to the window of the room in which they were, facing the street.
â€œi see!â€ said he, â€œthere are two of them; one does the work while the
other stands guard.â€ he made a sign to ali not to lose sight of the man
in the street, and turned to the one in the dressing-room.

the glass-cutter had entered, and was feeling his way, his arms
stretched out before him. at last he appeared to have made himself
familiar with his surroundings. there were two doors; he bolted them
both.

when he drew near to the bedroom door, monte cristo expected that he was
coming in, and raised one of his pistols; but he simply heard the sound
of the bolts sliding in their copper rings. it was only a

 doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they
grind against the bolt. â€œah, ha,â€ whispered monte cristo with a smile of
disappointment, â€œhe is only a thief.â€

but the man in the dark could not find the right key. he reached the
instrument he had placed on the stand, touched a spring, and immediately
a pale light, just bright enough to render objects distinct, was
reflected on his hands and countenance. â€œby heavens,â€ exclaimed monte
cristo, starting back, â€œit is----â€


ali raised his hatchet. â€œdonâ€™t stir,â€ whispered monte cristo, â€œand put
down your hatchet; we shall require no arms.â€ then he added some words
in a low tone, for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the
count, faint as it had been, had startled the man who remained in the
pose of the old knife-grinder. it was an order the count had just given,
for immediately ali went noiselessly, and returned, bearing a black
dress and a three-cornered hat. meanwhile monte cristo had rapidly take

 window. the
man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down, and was still
pacing the street; but, strange as it appeared, he cared not for those
who might pass from the avenue of the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es or by the faubourg
saint-honorÃ©; his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the
countâ€™s, and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in
the dressing-room.

monte cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile
passed over his lips; then drawing near to ali, he whispered,--

â€œremain here, concealed in the dark, and whatever noise you hear,
whatever passes, only come in or show yourself if i call you.â€ ali bowed
in token of strict obedience. monte cristo then drew a lighted taper
from a closet, and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock,
silently opened the door, taking care that the light should shine
directly on his face. the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no
sound; but, to his astonishment, the room was suddenly illumin

 the street, he saw first caderousse, who after walking to the
end of the garden, fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part
from where he came in. the count then looking over into the street, saw
the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction, and place
himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over.
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly, and looked over the coping to see
if the street was quiet. no one could be seen or heard. the clock of the
invalides struck one. then caderousse sat astride the coping, and
drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall; then he began to descend,
or rather to slide down by the two stanchions, which he did with an ease
which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise. but, once started,
he could not stop. in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when
he was halfway down--in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the
ground. before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently

finding that he no longer cried out, lifted his head up by the hair; his
eyes were closed, and the mouth was distorted. the murderer, supposing
him dead, let fall his head and disappeared. then caderousse, feeling
that he was leaving him, raised himself on his elbow, and with a dying
voice cried with great effort, â€œmurder! i am dying! help, reverend sir,-
-help!â€

this mournful appeal pierced the darkness. the door of the back-
staircase opened, then the side-gate of the garden, and ali and his
master were on the spot with lights.



chapter 83. the hand of god

caderousse continued to call piteously, â€œhelp, reverend sir, help!â€

â€œwhat is the matter?â€ asked monte cristo.

â€œhelp,â€ cried caderousse; â€œi am murdered!â€

â€œwe are here;--take courage.â€

â€œah, itâ€™s all over! you are come too late--you are come to see me die.
what blows, what blood!â€ he fainted. ali and his master conveyed the
wounded man into a room. monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him,

and he then examined his dreadful wounds. â€œmy god!â€ he exclaimed, â€œthy
vengeance is sometimes delayed, but only that it may fall the more
effectually.â€ ali looked at his master for further instructions. â€œbring
here immediately the kingâ€™s attorney, m. de villefort, who lives in the
faubourg saint-honorÃ©. as you pass the lodge, wake the porter, and send
him for a surgeon.â€ ali obeyed, leaving the abbÃ© alone with caderousse,
who had not yet revived.

when the wretched man again opened his eyes, the count looked at him
with a mournful expression of pity, and his lips moved as if in prayer.
â€œa surgeon, reverend sir--a surgeon!â€ said caderousse.

â€œi have sent for one,â€ replied the abbÃ©.

â€œi know he cannot save my life, but he may strengthen me to give my
evidence.â€

â€œagainst whom?â€

â€œagainst my murderer.â€

â€œdid you recognize him?â€

â€œyes; it wa

 caderousse sighed deeply, and fell back with a groan. the blood no
longer flowed from his wounds. he was dead.

â€œ_one!_â€ said the count mysteriously, his eyes fixed on the corpse,
disfigured by so awful a death. ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and
the procureur arrived, the one accompanied by the porter, the other by
ali, and were received by the abbÃ© busoni, who was praying by the side
of the corpse.



chapter 84. beauchamp

the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation
throughout paris for the next fortnight. the dying man had signed a
deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin. the police had orders
to make the strictest search for the murderer. caderousseâ€™s knife, dark
lantern, bunch of keys, and clothing, excepting the waistcoat, which
could not be found, were deposited at th

died on his lips. â€œmy friend,â€ said beauchamp, in the most affectionate
tone, â€œi should gladly make an apology; but, alas, ----â€

â€œbut what?â€

â€œthe paragraph was correct, my friend.â€

â€œwhat? that french officer----â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œyes.â€

was----â€

furiously towards beauchamp, but the latter restrained him more by a
mild look than by his extended hand.

â€œmy friend,â€ said he, â€œhere is a proof of it.â€


albert opened the paper, it was an attestation of four notable
inhabitants of yanina, proving that colonel fernand mondego, in the
service of ali tepelini, had surrendered the castle for two million
crowns. the signatures were perfectly legal. albert tottered and fell
overpowered in a chair. it could no longer be doubted; the family name
was fully given. after a momentâ€™s mournful silence, his heart
overflowed, and he gave way to a flood of tears. beauchamp, who had
watched with sincere pity the young manâ€™s paroxysm of grief, approached
him. â€œnow, albert,â€ said he, â€œyou understand me--do you not? i wished to
see all, and to judg

would be in your fatherâ€™s favor, and that i might do him justice. but,
on the contrary, the particulars which are given prove that fernand
mondego, raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor-general, is no
other than count fernand of morcerf; then, recollecting the honor you
had done me, in admitting me to your friendship, i hastened to you.â€

albert, still extended on the chair, covered his face with both hands,
as if to prevent the light from reaching him. â€œi hastened to you,â€
 continued beauchamp, â€œto tell you, albert, that in this changing age,
the faults of a father cannot revert upon his children. few have passed

â€œlet us not misunderstand each other,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œi
introduce no one, and certainly not m. cavalcanti.â€

â€œand who,â€ said albert with a forced smile, â€œis to marry mademoiselle
danglars instead of me, which grieves me cruelly.â€

â€œwhat? cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars?â€ asked
beauchamp.

â€œcertainly; do you come from the end of the world?â€ said monte cristo;
â€œyou, a journalist, the husband of renown? it is the talk of all paris.â€

â€œand you, count, have made this match?â€ asked beauchamp.

â€œi? silence, purveyor of gossip, do not spread that report. i make a
match? no, you do not know me; i have done all in my power to oppose
it.â€

â€œah, i understand,â€ said beauchamp, â€œon our friend albertâ€™s account.â€

â€œon my account?â€ said the young man; â€œoh, no, indeed, the count will do
me the justice to assert that i have, on the contrary, always entreated

in paris just now to watch the paper.â€

â€œah, you are a good and an excellent friend,â€ said albert; â€œyes, you are
right; watch, watch, beauchamp, and try to discover the enemy who made
this disclosure.â€ albert and beauchamp parted, the last pressure of
their hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger.

â€œbeauchamp is a worthy fellow,â€ said monte cristo, when the journalist
was gone; â€œis he not, albert?â€

â€œyes, and a sincere friend; i love him devotedly. but now we are alone,-
-although it is immaterial to me,--where are we going?â€

horses stationed on the road were ready. before his departure, the count
went to haydÃ©eâ€™s apartments, told her his intention, and resigned
everything to her care.

albert was punctual. the journey soon became interesting from its
rapidity, of which morcerf had formed no previous idea. â€œtruly,â€ said
monte cristo, â€œwith your post-horses going at the rate of two leagues an
hour, and that absurd law that one traveller shall not pass another
without permission, so that an invalid or ill-tempered traveller may
detain those who are well and active, it is impossible to move; i escape
this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and horses; do i not,
ali?â€

the count put his head out of the window and whistled, and the horses
appeared to fly. the carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the
pavement, and everyone turned to notice the dazzling meteor. ali,
smiling, repeated the sound, grasped the reins with a firm hand, and
spurred his horses, whose beautiful ma

â€œprecisely,â€ said the count; â€œsix years since i bought a horse in

tonight are its progeny; they are all entirely black, with the exception
of a star upon the forehead.â€

â€œthat is perfectly admirable; but what do you do, count, with all these
horses?â€

â€œyou see, i travel with them.â€

â€œbut you are not always travelling.â€

â€œwhen i no longer require them, bertuccio will sell them, and he expects
to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale.â€

â€œbut no monarch in europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them.â€

â€œthen he will sell them to some eastern vizier, who will empty his
coffers to purchase them, and refill them by applying the bastinado to
his subjects.â€

â€œcount, may i suggest one idea to you?â€

â€œcertainly.â€

â€œit is that, next to you, bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in
europe.â€

â€œyou are mistaken, viscount; i believe he has not a franc in his

â€œyes, my mother,â€ said albert, â€œi will return, and woe to the infamous
wretch! but first of all i must get there.â€

he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo. five minutes
had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance. his
voice had become rough and hoarse; his face was furrowed with wrinkles;
his eyes burned under the blue-veined lids, and he tottered like a
drunken man. â€œcount,â€ said he, â€œi thank you for your hospitality, which
i would gladly have enjoyed longer; but i must return to paris.â€

â€œwhat has happened?â€

â€œa great misfortune, more important to me than life. donâ€™t question me,
i beg of you, but lend me a horse.â€

â€œmy stables are at your command, viscount; but you will kill yourself by
riding on horseback. take a post-chaise or a carriage.â€

â€œno, it would delay me, and i need the fatigue you warn me of; it will
do me good.â€ albert reeled as if he had been shot, and fell on a chair

throwing himself on his horse. â€œreturn as soon as you can, florentin.

anger.â€

while the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse, which
leaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus, and shot away with
the rapidity of an arrow. the count watched him with a feeling of
compassion, and when he had completely disappeared, read as follows:--

â€œthe french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to
three weeks since in _lâ€™impartial_, who not only surrendered the castle
of yanina, but sold his benefactor to the turks, styled himself truly at
that time fernand, as our esteemed contemporary states; but he has since
added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name. he
now calls himself the count of morcerf, and ranks among the peers.â€

thus the terrible secret, which beauchamp had so generously destroyed,
appeared again like an armed phantom; an

at eight oâ€™clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchampâ€™s door.
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once.
beauchamp was in his bath. â€œhere i am,â€ said albert.

â€œwell, my poor friend,â€ replied beauchamp, â€œi expected you.â€

â€œi need not say i think you are too faithful and too

ng a service to oneâ€™s country to
denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed
on them.â€ beauchamp was thunderstruck. â€œwho, then, has so correctly
informed you?â€ asked he; â€œfor my paper, which gave the first information
on the subject, has been obliged to stop for want of proof; and yet we
are more interested than you in exposing m. de morcerf, as he is a peer
of france, and we are of the opposition.â€

â€œoh, that is very simple; we have not sought to scandalize. this news
was brought to us. a man arrived yesterday from yanina, bringing a
formidable array of documents; and when we hesitated to publish the
accusatory article, he told us it should be inserted in some other
paper.â€

beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit, and left the
office to despatch a courier to morcerf. but he had been unable to send
to albert the following particulars, as the events had transpired after
the messengerâ€™s departure; namely, that the same day a g

unhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice; the finger of god

the count of morcerf alone was ignorant of the news. he did not take in
the paper containing the defamatory article, and had passed the morning
in writing letters and in trying a horse. he arrived at his usual hour,
with a proud look and insolent demeanor; he alighted, passed through the
corridors, and entered the house without observing the hesitation of the
door-keepers or the coolness of his colleagues. business had already
been going on for half an hour when he entered. everyone held the
accusing paper, but, as usual, no one liked to take upon himself the
responsibility of the attack. at length an honorable peer, morcerfâ€™s
acknowledged enemy, ascended the tribune with that solemnity which
announced that the expected moment had arrived. there was a

the astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt, conciliated
some in his favor; for men who are truly generous are always ready to

their hatred.


the president put it to the vote, and it was decided that the
investigation should take place. the count was asked what time he
required to prepare his defence. morcerfâ€™s courage had revived when he
found himself alive after this horrible blow. â€œmy lords,â€ answered he,
â€œit is not by time i could repel the attack made on me by enemies
unknown to me, and, doubtless, hidden in obscurity; it is immediately,
and by a thunderbolt, that i must repel the flash of lightning which,
for a moment, startled me. oh, that i could, instead of taking up this
defence, shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that
i am their equal in worth.â€ these words made a favorable impression on

-keepers brought in
a letter for the president. â€˜you are at liberty to speak, m. de
morcerf,â€™ said the president, as he unsealed the letter; and the count
began his defence, i assure you, albert, in a most eloquent and skilful
manner. he produced documents proving that the vizier of yanina had up
to the last moment honored him with his entire confidence, since he had
interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor. he
produced the ring, his mark of authority, with which ali pasha generally
sealed his letters, and which the latter had given him, that he might,
on his return at any hour of the day or night, gain access to the
presence, even in the harem. unfortunately, the negotiation failed, and
when he returned to defend his benefactor, he was dead. â€˜but,â€™ said the
count, â€˜so great was ali pashaâ€™s confidence, that on his death-bed he
resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care.â€™â€ albert

he, â€˜you have heard the comte de morcerfâ€™s defence. can you, sir,
produce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?â€™--â€˜alas,
no, monsieur,â€™ replied the count; â€˜all those who surrounded the vizier,
or who knew me at his court, are either dead or gone away, i know not
where. i believe that i alone, of all my countrymen, survived that
dreadful war. i have only the letters of ali tepelini, which i have
placed before you; the ring, a token of his good-will, which is here;
and, lastly, the most convincing proof i can offer, after an anonymous
attack, and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and
the purity of my military life.â€™ a murmur of approbation ran through the
assembly; and at this moment, albert, had nothing more transpired, your
fatherâ€™s cause had been gained. it only remained to put it to the vote,
when the president resumed: â€˜gentlemen an

he papers he held. the
committee decided to hear the letter; the count was thoughtful and
silent. the president read:--

â€œâ€˜mr. president,--i can furnish the committee of inquiry into the
conduct of the lieutenant-general the count of morcerf in epirus and in
macedonia with important particulars.â€™

â€œthe president paused, and the count turned pale. the president looked
at his auditors. â€˜proceed,â€™ was heard on all sides. the president
resumed:--

â€œâ€˜i was on the spot at the death of ali pasha. i was present during his
last moments. i know what is become of vasiliki and haydÃ©e. i am at the
command of the committee, and even claim the honor of being heard. i
shall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you.â€™

â€œâ€˜and who is this witness, or rather this enemy?â€™ asked the count, in a
tone in which there was a visible alteration. â€˜we shall know, sir,â€™
replied the president. â€˜is the committee willing to hear this witness?â€™-

vasiliki, his beloved wife.â€™


â€œthe blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the
cheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly
important communication, produced an indescribable effect on the
assembly. as for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if a
thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before
him. â€˜madame,â€™ replied the president, bowing with profound respect,

raising her ardent gaze to heaven, â€˜that on which i find at last an

colleagues looked at him, and doubtless pitied his prospects, blighted
under the perfumed breath of a woman. his misery was depicted in
sinister lines on his countenance. â€˜m. de morcerf,â€™ said the president,
â€˜do you recognize this lady as the daughter of ali tepelini, pasha of
yanina?â€™--â€˜no,â€™ said morcerf, attempting to rise, â€˜it is a base plot,
contrived by my enemies.â€™ haydÃ©e, whose eyes had been fixed on the door,
as if expecting someone, turned hastily, and, seeing the count standing,
shrieked, â€˜you do not know me?â€™ said she. â€˜well, i fortunately recognize

â€œthese words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth,
that every eye was fixed on the countâ€™s forehead, and he himself passed
his hand across it, as if he felt aliâ€™s blood still lingering there.

be, indeed, a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend
himself. they expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a
fiery outburst. â€˜well,â€™ asked the president, â€˜what is your decision?â€™


â€œâ€˜i have no reply to make,â€™ said the count in a low tone.

â€œâ€˜has the daughter of ali tepelini spoken the truth?â€™ said the
president. â€˜is she, then, the terrible witness to whose charge you dare
not plead â€œnot guiltyâ€? have you really committed the crimes of which

might have softened tigers, but which could not disarm his judges. then

besides, what was morcerf seeking? it was not whether danglars or monte

offence, whether trifling or serious; it was a man who would fight, and
it was evident danglars would not fight. and, in addition to this,
everything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his
recollection. monte cristo knew everything, as he had bought the
daughter of ali pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised danglars
to write to yanina. the answer known, he had yielded to albertâ€™s wish to
be introduced to haydÃ©e, and allowed the conversation to turn on the
death of ali, and had not opposed haydÃ©eâ€™s recital (but having,
doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few romaic words he spoke to
her, not to implicate morcerfâ€™s father). besides, had he not begged of
morcerf not to mention his fatherâ€™s name before haydÃ©e? lastly, he had

passing at the back of the boxes, and the count knew that the
approaching storm was intended to fall on him. he was at the moment
conversing cheerfully with morrel, but he was well prepared for what
might happen. the door opened, and monte cristo, turning round, saw
albert, pale and trembling, followed by beauchamp and chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œwell,â€ cried he, with that benevolent politeness which distinguished
his salutation from the common civilities of the world, â€œmy cavalier has
attained his object. good-evening, m. de morcerf.â€ the countenance of
this man, who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings,
expressed the most perfect cordiality. morrel only then recollected the
letter he had received from the viscount, in which, without assigning
any reason, he begged him to go to the opera, but he understood that
something terrible was brooding.

â€œbut there must be some cause for this strange scene.â€

â€œhave you anything to do with it?â€

â€œit was through haydÃ©e that the chamber was informed of his fatherâ€™s
treason.â€

â€œindeed?â€ said morrel. â€œi had been told, but would not credit it, that
the grecian slave i have seen with you here in this very box was the
daughter of ali pasha.â€

â€œit is true, nevertheless.â€

â€œthen,â€ said morrel, â€œi understand it all, and this scene was
premeditated.â€

â€œhow so?â€

â€œyes. albert wrote to request me to come to the opera, doubtless that i
might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you.â€

albert, again fell, and a rap was heard at the door.

emotion; and immediately beauchamp appeared. â€œgood-evening, m.

beauchamp bowed, and, sitting down, â€œsir,â€ said he, â€œi just now

beauchamp, quite disconcerted, not knowing if he was dealing with an
arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being.

â€œvery well, sir,â€ said monte cristo. â€œnow all that is settled, do let me
see the performance, and tell your friend albert not to come any more
this evening; he will hurt himself with all his ill-chosen barbarisms:

chapter 89. the night

monte cristo waited, according to his usual custom, until duprez had
sung his famous â€œ_suivez-moi!_â€ then he rose and went out. morrel took
leave of him at the door, renewing his promise to be with him the next
morning at seven oâ€™clock, and to bring emmanuel. then he stepped into
his _coupÃ©_, calm and smiling, and was at home in five minutes. no one
who knew the count could mistake his expression when, on entering, he
said, â€œali, bring me my pistols with the ivory cross.â€

ali brought the box to his master, who examined the weapons with a
solicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a
little powder and shot. these were pistols of an especial pattern, which
monte cristo had had made for target practice in his own room. a cap was
sufficient to drive out the bullet, and from the adjoining room no one
would have suspected that the count was, as sportsmen would say, keeping
his hand in. he was just

what injury has fernand mondego done you in betraying ali tepelini?â€

â€œah, madame,â€ replied monte cristo, â€œall this is an affair between the
french captain and the daughter of vasiliki. it does not concern me, you
are right; and if i have sworn to revenge myself, it is not on the
french captain, or the count of morcerf, but on the fisherman fernand,
the husband of mercÃ©dÃ¨s the catalane.â€

â€œah, sir!â€ cried the countess, â€œhow terrible a vengeance for a fault
which fatality made me commit!--for i am the only culprit, edmond, and
if you

deceased father, i have sworn to revenge myself on fernand, and--i have
revenged myself.â€

â€œand you are sure the unhappy fernand did that?â€

â€œi am satisfied, madame, that he did what i have told you; besides, that
is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass
over to the english; that a spaniard by birth should have fought against
the spaniards; that a stipendiary of ali should have betrayed and
murdered ali. compared with such things, what is the letter you have
just read?--a loverâ€™s deception, which the woman who has married that
man ought certainly to forgive; but not so the lover who was to have
married her. well, the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor,
the spaniards did not shoot the traitor, ali in his tomb left the
traitor unpunished; but i, betrayed, sacrificed, buried, have risen from
my tomb, by the grace of god, to punish that man. he

or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers, and i wept! what

i dreamed each night the same dream. i had been told that you had
endeavored to escape; that you had taken the place of another prisoner;
that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body; that you had
been thrown alive from the top of the chÃ¢teau dâ€™if, and that the cry you
uttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that
they were your murderers. well, edmond, i swear to you, by the head of
that son for whom i entreat your pity,--edmond, for ten years i saw
every night every detail of that frightful tragedy, and for ten years i

but the count did not answer. mercÃ©dÃ¨s opened the door of the study and
had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound
reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him. the clock of
the invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed madame de
morcerf rolled away on the pavement of the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es, and made
monte cristo raise his head. â€œwhat a fool i was,â€ said he, â€œnot to tear
my heart out on the day when i resolved to avenge myself!â€



chapter 90. the meeting

after mercÃ©dÃ¨s had left monte cristo, he fell into profound gloom.
around him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped;
his energetic mind slumbered, as the body does after extreme fat

into silence.

â€œno, it is not existence, then, that i regret, but the ruin of projects
so slowly carried out, so laboriously framed. providence is now opposed
to them, when i most thought it would be propitious. it is not godâ€™s
will that they should be accomplished. this burden, almost as heavy as a
world, which i had raised, and i had thought to bear to the end, was too
great for my strength, and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle
of my career. oh, shall i then, again become a fatalist, whom fourteen
years of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence?
and all this--all this, because my heart, which i thought dead, was only
sleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again, because i
have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a
womanâ€™s voice. yet,â€ continued the count, becoming each moment more
absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow,
which mercÃ©dÃ¨s had accepted, â€œyet, it is impossible

are only exchanging time for eternity.â€

while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties,--wretched waking
dreams of grief,--the first rays of morning pierced his windows, and
shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his
justification of providence. it was just five oâ€™clock in the morning
when a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear. he turned his
head, looked around him, and saw no one; but the sound was repeated
distinctly enough to convince him of its reality.

he arose, and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room, saw haydÃ©e,
who had fallen on a chair, with her arms hanging down and her beautiful
head thrown back. she had been standing at the door, to prevent his
going out without seeing her, until sleep, which the young cannot
resist, had overpowered her frame, wearied as she was with watching. the
noise of the door did not awaken her, and monte cristo gazed at her with
affectionate regret. â€œshe remembered that she had a son,â€ said he;

â€œi bequeath to maximilian morrel, captain of spahis,--and son of my
former patron, pierre morrel, shipowner at marseilles,--the sum of
twenty millions, a part of which may be offered to his sister julia and
brother-in-law emmanuel, if he does not fear this increase of fortune
may mar their happiness. these twenty millions are concealed in my
grotto at monte cristo, of which bertuccio knows the secret. if his
heart is free, and he will marry haydÃ©e, the daughter of ali pasha of
yanina, whom i have brought up with the love of a father, and who has
shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me, he will thus
accomplish my last wish. this will has already constituted haydÃ©e
heiress of the rest of my fortune, consisting of lands, funds in
england, austria, and holland, furniture in my different palaces and
houses, and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my
servants, may still amount to sixty millions.â€


he was finishing the last line whe

than as a daughter loves a father.

â€œalas,â€ murmured he, with intense suffering, â€œi might, then, have been
happy yet.â€ then he carried haydÃ©e to her room, resigned her to the care
of her attendants, and returning to his study, which he shut quickly
this time, he again copied the destroyed will. as he was finishing, the
sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard. monte cristo
approached the window, and saw maximilian and emmanuel alight. â€œgood,â€
 said he; â€œit was time,â€--and he sealed his will with three seals. a
moment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing-room, and went to open
the door himself. morrel was there; he had come twenty minutes before
the time appointed. â€œi am perhaps come too soon, count,â€ said he, â€œbut i
frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my eyes all night, nor has
anyone in my house. i need to see you strong in your courageous
assurance, to recover myself.â€ monte cristo could no

have been thinking of your firmness all night, and i said to myself that
justice must be on your side, or manâ€™s countenance is no longer to be

â€œbut, morrel, albert is your friend?â€

â€œsimply an acquaintance, sir.â€

â€œyou met on the same day you first saw me?â€

â€œyes, that is true; but i should not have recollected it if you had not
reminded me.â€

â€œthank you, morrel.â€ then ringing the bell once, â€œlook.â€ said he to ali,
who came immediately, â€œtake that to my solicitor. it is my will, morrel.

â€œwhat?â€ said morrel, â€œyou dead?â€

â€œyes; must i not be prepared for everything, dear friend? but what did
you do yesterday after you left me?â€

â€œi went to tortoniâ€™s, where, as i expected, i found beauchamp and

â€œproceed, sir,â€ said the count.

â€œsir,â€ said albert, at first with a tremulous voice, but which gradually
became firmer, â€œi reproached you with exposing the conduct of m. de
morcerf in epirus, for guilty as i knew he was, i thought you had no
right to punish him; but i have since learned that you had that right.
it is not fernand mondegoâ€™s treachery towards ali pasha which induces me
so readily to excuse you, but the treachery of the fisherman fernand
towards you, and the almost unheard-of miseries which were its
consequences; and i say, and proclaim it publicly, that you were
justified in revenging yourself on my father, and i, his son, thank you
for not using greater severity.â€

had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this
unexpected scene, it would not have surprised them more than did
albertâ€™s declaration. as for monte crist

sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless. â€œnow, sir,â€ said albert,
â€œif you think my apology sufficient, pray give me your hand. next to the
merit of infallibility which you appear to possess, i rank that of
candidly acknowledging a fault. but this confession concerns me only. i
acted well as a man, but you have acted better than man. an angel alone
could have saved one of us from death--that angel came from heaven, if
not to make us friends (which, alas, fatality renders impossible), at
least to make us esteem each other.â€

monte cristo, with moistened eye, heaving breast, and lips half open,
extended to albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment
resembling respectful fear. â€œgentlemen,â€ said he, â€œm. de monte cristo

generally bad ones. now my fault is repaired. i hope the world will not

s scarcely whispered â€œgood-
bye,â€ but his look was more explicit; it expressed a whole poem of
restrained anger, proud disdain, and generous indignation. he preserved
his melancholy and motionless position for some time after his two
friends had regained their carriage; then suddenly unfastening his horse
from the little tree to which his servant had tied it, he mounted and
galloped off in the direction of paris.

in a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the rue du helder.
as he alighted, he thought he saw his fatherâ€™s pale face behind the
curtain of the countâ€™s bedroom. albert turned away his head with a sigh,
and went to his own apartments. he cast one lingering look on all the
luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his infancy;
he looked at the pictures, whose faces seemed to smile, and the
landscapes, which appeared painted in brighter colors. then he took away
his motherâ€™s portrait, with its oaken frame, leaving the gilt frame from

us act promptly. m. de morcerf went out about half an hour ago; the
opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation.â€

â€œi am ready, my son,â€ said mercÃ©dÃ¨s. albert ran to fetch a carriage. he
recollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the rue des
saints-pÃ¨res, where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging,
and thither he intended conducting the countess. as the carriage stopped
at the door, and albert was alighting, a man approached and gave him a
letter. albert recognized the bearer. â€œfrom the count,â€ said bertuccio.
albert took the letter, opened, and read it, then looked round for
bertuccio, but he was gone. he returned to mercÃ©dÃ¨s with tears in his
eyes and heaving breast, and without uttering a word he gave her the
letter. mercÃ©dÃ¨s read:--

â€œalbert,--while showing you that i have discovered your plans, i hope
also to convince you of my delicacy. you are free, you leave the countâ€™s

so well!â€

â€œon the contrary,â€ said the count, â€œwe know so little of each other.â€

â€œindeed?â€ said monte cristo, with the same indomitable coolness; â€œlet us
see. are you not the soldier fernand who deserted on the eve of the
battle of waterloo? are you not the lieutenant fernand who served as
guide and spy to the french army in spain? are you not the captain
fernand who betrayed, sold, and murdered his benefactor, ali? and have
not all these fernands, united, made lieutenant-general, the count of
morcerf, peer of france?â€

â€œoh,â€ cried the general, as if branded with a hot iron, â€œwretch,--to
reproach me with my shame when about, perhaps, to kill me! no, i did not
say i was a stranger to you. i know well, demon, that you have

e, distressing cry:

edmond dantÃ¨s!â€

then, with sighs which were unlike any human sound, he dragged himself
to the door, reeled across the courtyard, and falling into the arms of
his valet, he said in a voice scarcely intelligible,--â€œhome, home.â€ the
fresh air and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his
servants, partly recalled his senses, but the ride was short, and as he
drew near his house all his wretchedness revived. he stopped at a short
distance from the house and alighted.

the door was wide open, a hackney-coach was standing in the middle of
the yard--a strange sight before so noble a mansion; the count looked at
it with terror, but without daring to inquire its meaning, he rushed
towards his apartment. two persons were coming down the stairs; he had
only time to creep into an alcove to avoid them. it was mercÃ©dÃ¨s leaning
on her sonâ€™s arm and leaving the house. they passed close by the unhappy
being, who, concealed behind the damask curtain, almost fel

they had been ushered into madame de villefortâ€™s room, who had said she
would receive them there. that is why valentine passed through her room,
which was on a level with valentineâ€™s, and only separated from it by
edwardâ€™s. the two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of
official stiffness which preludes a formal communication. among worldly
people manner is contagious. madame de villefort received them with
equal solemnity. valentine entered at this moment, and the formalities
were resumed. â€œmy dear friend,â€ said the baroness, while the two young
people were shaking hands, â€œi and eugÃ©nie are come to be the first to
announce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with prince
cavalcanti.â€ danglars kept up the title of prince. the popular banker
found that it answered better than count. â€œallow me to present you my
sincere congratulations,â€ replied madame de villefort. â€œprince
cavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities.â€

en,â€ said the baroness, smiling; â€œspeaking to you as a friend i can
say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be. he has about him
a little of that foreign manner by which french persons recognize, at
first sight, the italian or german nobleman. besides, he gives evidence
of great kindness of disposition, much keenness of wit, and as to
suitability, m. danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic--that
is his word.â€

â€œand then,â€ said eugÃ©nie, while turning over the leaves of madame de
villefortâ€™s album, â€œadd that you have taken a great fancy to the young
man.â€

â€œand,â€ said madame de villefort, â€œi need not ask you if you share that
fancy.â€

upstairs without saying a word. the porter knew him, and let him pass,
only calling to him, â€œin his study, monsieur procureur--in his study!â€
 villefort pushed, or rather forced, the door open.

â€œah,â€ said the doctor, â€œis it you?â€

â€œyes,â€ said villefort, closing the door after him, â€œit is i, who am come
in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone. doctor, my house is
accursed!â€

â€œwhat?â€ said the latter with apparent coolness, but with deep emotion,
â€œhave you another invalid?â€

â€œyes, doctor,â€ cried villefort, clutching his hair, â€œyes!â€

dâ€™avrignyâ€™s look implied, â€œi told you it would be so.â€ then he slowly
uttered these words, â€œwho is now dying in your house? what new victim is
going to accuse you of weakness before god?â€ a mournful sob burst from
villefortâ€™s heart; he approached the doctor, and seizing his arm,--
â€œvalentine,â€ said he, â€œit is valentineâ€™s turn!â€


â€œyour daughter!â€ cried dâ€™avrigny with grief and surprise.

â€œpity albert also, maximilian; for believe me he is the worthy son of
the countess. but let us return to yourself. you have hastened to me--
can i have the happiness of being useful to you?â€

â€œyes, i need your help: that is i thought like a madman that you could
lend me your assistance in a case where god alone can succor me.â€


â€œtell me what it is,â€ replied monte cristo.

â€œoh,â€ said morrel, â€œi know not, indeed, if i may reveal this secret to
mortal ears, but fatality impels me, necessity constrains me, count----â€
 morrel hesitated.

â€œdo you think i love you?â€ said monte cristo, taking the young manâ€™s
hand affectionately in his.

â€œoh, you encourage me, and something tells me there,â€ placing his hand
on his heart, â€œthat i ought to have no secret from you.â€

â€œyou are right, morrel; god is speaking to your heart, and your heart
speaks to you. tell me what it says.â€

â€œcount, will you allow me to send baptistin to inquire after someone you

physician, and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths.
well, i have not intercepted your confidence, and yet i know all that as
well as you, and i have no conscientious scruples. no, it does not
concern me. you say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that
house to godâ€™s anger--well, who says your supposition is not reality? do
not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass
over. if it is godâ€™s justice, instead of his anger, which is walking
through that house, maximilian, turn away your face and let his justice
accomplish its purpose.â€ morrel shuddered. there was something mournful,
solemn, and terrible in the countâ€™s manner. â€œbesides,â€ continued he, in
so changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person
speaking--â€œbesides, who says that it will begin again?

, my friend,â€ replied the count. â€œgo; i must be
alone.â€

morrel, subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy monte cristo exercised
over everything around him, did not endeavor to resist it. he pressed
the countâ€™s hand and left. he stopped one moment at the door for
baptistin, whom he saw in the rue matignon, and who was running.

meanwhile, villefort and dâ€™avrigny had made all possible haste,
valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival, and
the doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances
demanded, and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret
intensified twofold. villefort, closely watching his countenance and his
lips, awaited the result of the examination. noirtier, paler than even
the young girl, more eager than villefort for the decision, was watching
also intently and affectionately. at last dâ€™avrigny slowly uttered these
words:--â€œshe is still alive!â€

â€œstill?â€ cried villefort; â€œoh, doctor, what a dreadful word is t

â€œyes,â€ said the physician, â€œi repeat it; she is still alive, and i am
astonished at it.â€

â€œbut is she safe?â€ asked the father.

â€œyes, since she lives.â€ at that moment dâ€™avrignyâ€™s glance met noirtierâ€™s
eye. it glistened with such extraordinary joy, so rich and full of
thought, that the physician was struck. he placed the young girl again
on the chair,--her lips were scarcely discernible, they were so pale and
white, as well as her whole face,--and remained motionless, looking at
noirtier, who appeared to anticipate and commend all he di

avrigny, who saw that would be a means of his remaining

that could be done; but he forbade that anything should be given to her
except what he ordered.

they carried valentine away; she had revived, but could scarcely move or
speak, so shaken was her frame by the attack. she had, however, just
power to give one parting look to her grandfather, who in losing her
seemed to be resigning his very soul. dâ€™avrigny followed the invalid,
wrote a prescription, ordered villefort to take a cabriolet, go in
person to a chemistâ€™s to get the prescribed medicine, bring it himself,
and wait for him in his daughterâ€™s room. then, having renewed his
injunction not to give valentine anything, he went down again to
noirtier, shut the doors carefully, and after convincing himself that no
one was listening,--â€œdo you,â€ said he, â€œknow anything of this young
ladyâ€™s illness?â€

â€œyes,â€ said the old man.

â€œwe have no time to lo

ook every morning. â€œah, indeed?â€
 said dâ€™avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, â€œhas it occurred to youâ€--
noirtier did not let him finish. â€œyes,â€ said he. â€œto prepare her system
to resist poison?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œby accustoming her by degrees----â€

â€œyes, yes, yes,â€ said noirtier, delighted to be understood.

â€œof course. i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give
you.â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œand by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to
neutralize the effect of a similar poison?â€ noirtierâ€™s joy continued.
â€œand you have succeeded,â€ exclaimed dâ€™avrigny. â€œwithout that precaution
valentine would have died before assistance could have been procured.
the dose has been excessive, but she has only been shaken by it; and
this time, at any rate, valentine will not die.â€ a superhuman joy
expanded the old manâ€™s eyes, which were raised towards heaven with an
expression of infinite gratitude. at this moment villefort returned.
â€œher

ur presence?â€

â€œyes,â€ replied the procureur.

â€œhave you not let it go out of your hands?â€


â€œno.â€

dâ€™avrigny took the bottle, poured some drops of the mixture it contained
in the hollow of his hand, and swallowed them. â€œwell,â€ said he, â€œlet us
go to valentine; i will give instructions to everyone, and you, m. de
villefort, will yourself see that no one deviates from them.â€

at the moment when dâ€™avrigny was returning to valentineâ€™s room,
accompanied by villefort, an italian priest, of serious demeanor and
calm and firm tone, hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of
m. de villefort. no one knew how the three former tenants of that house
left it. about two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be
unsafe; but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing
himself there with his modest furniture the same day at five oâ€™clock.
the lease was drawn up for three, six, or nine years by the new tenant,
who, according to the rule of the propr

this new tenant, who, as we have said, was an italian, was called il
signor giacomo busoni. workmen were immediately called in, and that same
night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that
carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the
tottering house.



chapter 95. father and daughter

we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to
announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of eugÃ©nie
danglars and m. andrea cavalcanti. this formal announcement, which

doors, and listening to every sound. when his patience was exhausted, he
called his valet. â€œÃ©tienne,â€ said he, â€œsee why mademoiselle eugÃ©nie has
asked me to meet her in the drawing-room, and why she makes me wait so
long.â€

having given this vent to his ill-humor, the baron became more calm;
mademoiselle danglars had that morning requested an interview with her
father, and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot. the
singularity of this step, and above all its formality, had not a little
surprised the banker, who had immediately obeyed his daughter by
repairing first to the drawing-room. Ã©tienne soon returned from his
errand. â€œmademoiselleâ€™s ladyâ€™s maid says, sir, that mademoiselle is
finishing her toilette, and will be here shortly.â€

danglars nodded, to signify that he was satisfied. to the world and to
his servants danglars assumed the character of the good-natured man and
the indulgent father. this was one of his parts in the popular comedy he

as performing,--a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about as
well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors, who seen
from one side, were the image of geniality, and from the other showed
lips drawn down in chronic ill-temper. let us hasten to say that in
private the genial side descended to the level of the other, so that
generally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal
husband and domineering father. â€œwhy the devil does that foolish girl,
who pretends to wish to speak to me, not come into my study? and why on
earth does she want to speak to me at all?â€

he was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time,

this solemn drawing-room when the study is so comfortable?â€

â€œi quite understand why you ask, sir,â€ said eugÃ©nie, making a sign that
her father might be seated, â€œand in fact your two questions suggest

touching the money? this is no act of selfishness, but of delicacy. i am

paleness of his face. his only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the
slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat. a
circle was immediately formed around the door. the count perceived at
one glance madame danglars at one end of the drawing-room, m. danglars
at the other, and eugÃ©nie in front of him. he first advanced towards the
baroness, who was chatting with madame de villefort, who had come alone,
valentine being still an invalid; and without turning aside, so clear
was the road left for him, he passed from the baroness to eugÃ©nie, whom
he complimented in such rapid and measured terms, that the proud artist
was quite struck. near her was mademoiselle louise dâ€™armilly, who
thanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given
her for italy, which she intended immediately to make use of. on leaving
these ladies he found himself with danglars, who had advanced to meet
him.

delusions over the envious assembly. mademoiselle danglarsâ€™ charms were
heightened in the opinion of the young men, and for the moment seemed to
outvie the sun in splendor. as for the ladies, it is needless to say
that while they coveted the millions, they thought they did not need
them for themselves, as they were beautiful enough without them. andrea,
surrounded by his friends, complimented, flattered, beginning to believe
in the reality of his dream, was almost bewildered. the notary solemnly
took the pen, flourished it above his head, and said, â€œgentlemen, we are
about to sign the contract.â€

the baron was to sign first, then the representative of m. cavalcanti,
senior, then the baroness, afterwards the â€œfuture couple,â€ as they are
styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents. the baron took
the pen and signed, then the representative. the baroness approached,

of twenty years of age, even when they are torn with remorse. now, here
we are obliged to own that andrea ought to have felt remorse, but that
he did not. this was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the
best chance of his security. before daybreak he would awake, leave the
inn after rigorously paying his bill, and reaching the forest, he would,
under pretence of making studies in painting, test the hospitality of
some peasants, procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet,
casting off the lionâ€™s skin to assume that of the woodman; then, with
his hands covered with dirt, his hair darkened by means of a leaden
comb, his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his
old comrades had given him the recipe, he intended, by following the
wooded districts, to reach the nearest frontier, walking by night and

the maid had been below, and like everyone else she thought the young
ladies were in their own room; madame danglars, therefore, went to bed
without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the recent events.
in proportion as her memory became clearer, the occurrences of the
evening were revealed in their true light; what she had taken for
confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as something distressing,
was in reality a disgrace. and then the baroness remembered that she had
felt no pity for poor mercÃ©dÃ¨s, who had been afflicted with as severe a
blow through her husband and son.

â€œeugÃ©nie,â€ she said to herself, â€œis lost, and so are we. the affair, as

â€œi hope so.â€

â€œif they should arrest him (i know that sometimes prisons afford means

â€œfor all, even for myself among the rest,â€ replied villefort.

exclamation betrayed. villefort looked at her with that piercing glance
which reads the secrets of the heart.

ispelling such illusions was to drink, for a draught
of the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to
cause a reaction of the brain, and for a short time she suffered less.
valentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass, but as soon as
her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly
towards her, and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied
she heard his breath, and felt the pressure of his hand.

this time the illusion, or rather the reality, surpassed anything
valentine had before experienced; she began to believe herself really
alive and awake, and the belief that her reason was this time not
deceived made her shudder. the pressure she felt was evidently intended
to arrest her arm, and she slowly withdrew it. then the figure, from
whom she could not detach her eyes, and who appeared more protecting
than menacing, took the glass, and walking towards the night-light held
it up, as if to test its transparency. this did not seem su

it would vanish and give place to another
vision; but the man, instead of dissolving like a shadow, again
approached her, and said in an agitated voice, â€œnow you may drink.â€

valentine shuddered. it was the first time one of these visions had ever
addressed her in a living voice, and she was about to utter an
exclamation. the man placed his finger on her lips. â€œthe count of monte
cristo!â€ she murmured.

it was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girlâ€™s mind
as to the reality of the scene; her eyes started with terror, her hands
trembled, and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her. still, the
presence of monte cristo at such an hour, his mysterious, fanciful, and
extraordinary entrance into her room through the wall, might well seem
impossibilities to her shattered reason. â€œdo not call anyone--do not be
alarmed,â€ said the count; â€œdo not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness

â€œand have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of
dried orange-peel?â€

â€œoh, yes, yes!â€

directions, and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was
silent. then valentineâ€™s attention was engrossed by the clock in her
room, which marked the seconds. she began counting them, remarking that
they were much slower than the beatings of her heart; and still she
doubted,--the inoffensive valentine could not imagine that anyone should
desire her death. why should they? to what end? what had she done to
excite the malice of an enemy?

there was no fear of her falling asleep. one terrible idea pressed upon
her mind,--that someone existed in the world who had attempted to
assassinate her, and who was about to endeavor to do so again. supposing
this person, wearied at the inefficacy of the poison, should, as monte
cristo intimated, have recourse to steel!--what if the count should have
no time to run to her rescue!--what if her last moments were
approaching, and she should never again see morrel!

your servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be offered to
you disguised in every shape. you will find it in the water you drink
from the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree.â€

â€œbut did you not say that my kind grandfatherâ€™s precaution had
neutralized the poison?â€

â€œyes, but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed, and the
quantity increased.â€ he took the glass and raised it to his lips. â€œit is
already done,â€ he said; â€œbrucine is no longer employed, but a simple
narcotic! i can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been
dissolved. if you had taken what madame de villefort has poured into
your glass, valentine--valentine--you would have been doomed!â€

â€œi rave?â€ said morrel; â€œwell, then, i appeal to m. dâ€™avrigny himself.
ask him, sir, if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of
this house on the night of madame de saint-mÃ©ranâ€™s death. you thought
yourselves alone, and talked about that tragical death, and the fatality
you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of
valentine.â€ villefort and dâ€™avrigny exchanged looks. â€œyes, yes,â€
 continued morrel; â€œrecall the scene, for the words you thought were only
given to silence and solitude fell into my ears. certainly, after

dâ€™avrigny, and said,--â€œand now the priest.â€

â€œis there any particular priest you wish to pray with valentine?â€ asked
dâ€™avrigny.

chapter 104. danglarsâ€™ signature

the next morning dawned dull and cloudy. during the night the
undertakers had executed their melancholy office, and wrapped the corpse
in the winding-sheet, which, whatever may be said about the equality of
death, is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life. this
winding-sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric, which
the young girl had bought a fortnight before. during the evening two
men, engaged for the purpose, had carried noirtier from valentineâ€™s room
into his own, and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty in
withdrawing him from his child. the abbÃ© busoni had watched till
daylight, and then left without calling anyone. dâ€™avrigny returne

struck like a thunderbolt, and who, notwithstanding the raw chilliness
of the season, could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the
memory of the beautiful, chaste, and adorable girl, thus cut off in the
flower of her youth. as they left paris, an equipage with four horses,
at full speed, was seen to draw up suddenly; it contained monte cristo.
the count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on
foot. chÃ¢teau-renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his
_coupÃ©_, joined him.

the count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd; he was
evidently watching for someone, but his search ended in disappointment.
â€œwhere is morrel?â€ he asked; â€œdo either of these gentlemen know where he
is?â€

winter, he took possession of his apartment about four oâ€™clock, though
he never spent the night there. at half-past three in the winter the
fire was lighted by the discreet servant, who had the superintendence of
the little apartment, and in the summer ices were placed on the table at
the same hour. at four oâ€™clock, as we have already stated, the
mysterious personage arrived. twenty minutes afterwards a carriage
stopped at the house, a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress, and
always thickly veiled; she passed like a shadow through the lodge, and
ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot.
no one ever asked her where she was going. her face, therefore, like
that of the gentleman, was perfectly unknown to the two concierges, who
were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion. we need
not say she stopped at the first floor. then she tapped in a peculiar
manner at a door, which after bei

warned me of it. after the death of barrois my suspicions were directed

me, but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate
has been sad, bitter, and lamentable, then pity me.â€

n upright piano and a blue
satin couch. villefort stepped forward two or three paces, and beheld
his child lying--no doubt asleep--on the sofa. the unhappy man uttered
an exclamation of joy; a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of
despair and darkness. he had only to step over the corpse, enter the
boudoir, take the child in his arms, and flee far, far away.

villefort was no longer the civilized man; he was a tiger hurt unto
death, gnashing his teeth in his wound. he no longer feared realities,
but phantoms. he leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning
brazier. he took the child in his arms, embraced him, shook him, called
him, but the child made no response. he pressed his burning lips to the
cheeks, but they were icy cold and pale; he felt the stiffened limbs; he
pressed his hand upon the heart, but it no longer beat,--the child was
dead.

a folded paper fell from edwardâ€™s breast. villefort, thunderstruck, fell
upon his knees; the child dropped from his arms, and rol

â€œyou are not busoni?--you are not monte cristo? oh, heavens--you are,
then, some secret, implacable, and mortal enemy! i must have wronged you
in some way at marseilles. oh, woe to me!â€

â€œyes; you are now on the right path,â€ said the count, crossing his arms
over his broad chest; â€œsearch--search!â€

â€œbut what have i done to you?â€ exclaimed villefort, whose mind was
balancing between reason and insanity, in that cloud which is neither a
dream nor reality; â€œwhat have i done to you? tell me, then! speak!â€

â€œyou condemned me to a horrible, tedious death; you killed my father;
you deprived me of liberty, of love, and happiness.â€

â€œwho are you, then? who are you?â€

â€œi am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the chÃ¢teau
dâ€™if. god gave that spectre the form of the count of monte cristo when
he at length issued from his tomb, enriched him with gold and diamonds,
and led him to you!â€

-enough of this,â€ he cried; â€œlet me save the
last.â€ on entering his house, he met morrel, who wandered about like a
ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb. â€œprepare
yourself, maximilian,â€ he said with a smile; â€œwe leave paris tomorrow.â€

â€œhave you nothing more to do there?â€ asked morrel.

â€œno,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œgod grant i may not have done too much
already.â€

the next day they indeed left, accompanied only by baptistin. haydÃ©e had
taken away ali, and bertuccio remained with noirtier.



chapter 112. the departure

the recent events formed the theme of conversation throughout all paris.
emmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their
little apartment in the rue meslay upon the three successive, sudden,
and most unexpected catastrophes of morcerf, danglars, and villefort.
maximilian, who was paying them a visit, listened to their conversation,
or rather was present at it, plunged in his accustomed state of apathy.

ef; â€œi am under his orders for the next month.â€

â€œoh, heavens, how strangely he expresses himself, count!â€ said julie.

â€œmaximilian goes with _me_,â€ said the count, in his kindest and most
persuasive manner; â€œtherefore do not make yourself uneasy on your
brotherâ€™s account.â€

â€œonce more farewell, my dear sister; emmanuel, adieu!â€ morrel repeated.

â€œhis carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart,â€ said julie.
â€œoh, maximilian, maximilian, you are certainly concealing something from
us.â€

â€œpshaw!â€ said monte cristo, â€œyou will see him return to you gay,
smiling, and joyful.â€


maximilian cast a look of disdain, almost of anger, on the count.

â€œwe must leave you,â€ said monte cristo.

â€œbefore you quit us, count,â€ said julie, â€œwill you permit us to express
to you all that the other day----â€

â€œmadame,â€ interrupted the count, taking her two hands in his, â€œall that
you could say in words would never express what i read in your eyes; th

cristo. and the count pressed her hand in reply, as he had done eleven
years before on the staircase leading to morrelâ€™s study.

â€œyou still confide, then, in sinbad the sailor?â€ asked he, smiling.

â€œoh, yes,â€ was the ready answer.

â€œwell, then, sleep in peace, and put your trust in heaven.â€

as we have before said, the postchaise was waiting; four powerful horses
were already pawing the ground with impatience, while ali, apparently
just arrived from a long walk, was standing at the foot of the steps,
his face bathed in perspiration.

â€œwell,â€ asked the count in arabic, â€œhave you been to see the old man?â€
 ali made a sign in the affirmative.

â€œand have you placed the letter before him, as i ordered you to do?â€

the slave respectfully signalized that he had. â€œand what did he say, or
rather do?â€ ali placed himself in the light, so that his master might
see him distinctly, and then imitating in his

custom of doing when saying â€œyes.â€

â€œgood; he accepts,â€ said monte cristo. â€œnow let us go.â€


these words had scarcely escaped him, when the carriage was on its way,
and the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement.
maximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word. half
an hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly; the count had
just pulled the silken check-string, which was fastened to aliâ€™s finger.
the nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door. it was a
lovely starlight night--they had just reached the top of the hill
villejuif, from whence paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its
millions of phosphoric waves into light--waves indeed more noisy, more
passionate, more changeable, more furious, more greedy, than those of
the tempestuous ocean,--waves which never rest as those of the sea
sometimes do,--waves ever dashing, ever foaming, ever ingulfing what

 within their grasp.

the count stood alone, and at a sign from his hand, the carriage went on
for a short distance. with folded arms, he gazed for some time upon the
great city. when he had fixed his piercing look on this modern babylon,
which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast, the
materialist, and the scoffer,--

â€œgreat city,â€ murmured he, inclining his head, and joining his hands as
if in prayer, â€œless than six months have elapsed since first i entered
thy gates. i believe that the spirit of god led my steps to thee and
that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph; the secret cause of my
presence within thy walls i have confided alone to him who only has had
the power to read my heart. god only knows that i retire from thee

 in his cloak, could think only of this terrible voyage,
the details of which were one by one recalled to his memory. the
solitary light burning at the catalans; that first sight of the chÃ¢teau
dâ€™if, which told him whither they were leading him; the struggle with
the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard; his despair
when he found himself vanquished, and the sensation when the muzzle of
the carbine touched his forehead--all these were brought before him in
vivid and frightful reality.

like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up, and which
after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop, so did
the count feel his heart gradually fill with the bitterness which
formerly nearly overwhelmed edmond dantÃ¨s. clear sky, swift-flitting
boats, and brilliant sunshine disappeared; the heavens were hung with
black, and the gigantic structure of the chÃ¢teau dâ€™if seemed like the
phantom of a mortal enemy. as they reached the shore, the count

 of ground without exciting suspicion. this man was dressed in
a greatcoat, or rather a surtout, a little worse for the journey, but
which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of honor still fresh and
brilliant, a decoration which also ornamented the under coat. he might
be recognized, not only by these signs, but also from the accent with
which he spoke to the postilion, as a frenchman. another proof that he
was a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his
knowing no other italian words than the terms used in music, and which
like the â€œgoddamâ€ of figaro, served all possible linguistic
requirements. â€œ_allegro!_â€ he called out to the postilions at every
ascent. â€œ_moderato!_â€ he cried as they descended. and heaven knows there
are hills enough between rome and florence by the way of aquapendente!
these two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed. on
reaching la storta, the point from whence rome is first visible, the
traveller evinced none of t

peterâ€™s, which may be seen long before any other object is
distinguishable. no, he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket, and
took from it a paper folded in four, and after having examined it in a
manner almost reverential, he said--â€œgood! i have it still!â€


the carriage entered by the porto del popolo, turned to the left, and
stopped at the hÃ´tel dâ€™espagne. old pastrini, our former acquaintance,
received the traveller at the door, hat in hand. the traveller alighted,
ordered a good dinner, and inquired the address of the house of thomson
& french, which was immediately given to him, as it was one of the most
celebrated in rome. it was situated in the via dei banchi, near st.
peterâ€™s. in rome, as everywhere else, the arrival of a post-chaise is an
event. ten young descendants of marius and the gracchi, barefooted and
out at elbows, with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully
curved above the head, stared at the traveller, the post-chais

 his pocketbook under his pillow. peppino had a little
spare time, so he had a game of _morra_ with the facchini, lost three
crowns, and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto.

the next morning danglars awoke late, though he went to bed so early; he
had not slept well for five or six nights, even if he had slept at all.
he breakfasted heartily, and caring little, as he said, for the beauties
of the eternal city, ordered post-horses at noon. but danglars had not
reckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the
posting-master. the horses only arrived at two oâ€™clock, and the
_cicerone_ did not bring the passport till three.

all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the door
of signor pastriniâ€™s; the descendants of marius and the gracchi were
also not wanting. the baron walked triumphantly through the crowd, who
for the sake of gain styled him â€œyour excellency.â€ as danglars had
hitherto contented himself with being called a baron, he
 
 ___________________________
 
 felt rather
flattered at the title of excellency, and distributed a dozen silver
coins among the beggars, who were ready, for twelve more, to call him
â€œyour highness.â€

â€œwhich road?â€ asked the postilion in italian.

â€œthe ancona road,â€ replied the baron. signor pastrini interpreted the
question and answer, and the horses galloped off. danglars intended
travelling to venice, where he would receive one part of his fortune,
and then proceeding to vienna, where he would find the rest, he meant to
take up his residence in the latter town, which he had been told was a
city of pleasure.

he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began
to disappear. danglars had not intended starting 
 
 ___________________________
 
to come and demand
payment with the termination of his stage. he intended taking advantage
of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor; but the
horses were unharnessed, and others put in their places, without anyone
claiming money from the traveller. danglars, astonished, opened the
door; but a strong hand pushed him back, and the carriage rolled on. the
baron was completely roused. â€œeh?â€ he said to the postilion, â€œeh, _mio
caro?_â€

this was another little piece of italian the baron had learned from
hearing his daughter sing italian duets with cavalcanti. but _mio caro_
did not reply. danglars then opened the window.

â€œcome, my friend,â€ he said, thrusting his hand through the opening,
â€œwhere are we going?â€

â€œ_dentro la testa!_â€ answered a solemn and imperious voice, accompanied
by a menacing gesture. danglars thought _dentro la testa_ meant, â€œput in
your head!â€ he was making rapid progress in italian. he obeyed, not
without some uneasiness, whic

h, momentarily increasing, caused his mind,
instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey, to
fill with ideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake, more
especially one in such a situation as danglars. his eyes acquired that
quality which in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see
distinctly, and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed. before
we are alarmed, we see correctly; when we are alarmed, we see double;
and when we have been alarmed, we see nothing but trouble. danglars
observed a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage.

â€œsome gendarme!â€ he exclaimed. â€œcan i have been intercepted by french
telegrams to the pontifical authorities?â€ he resolved to end his
anxiety

uments of a singular form, and his mind now recalled all the details
morcerf had related, and comparing them with his own situation, he felt
sure that he must be on the appian way. on the left, in a sort of
valley, he perceived a circular excavation. it was caracallaâ€™s circus.
on a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage, it stopped.
at the same time the door was opened. â€œ_scendi!_â€ exclaimed a commanding
voice.

danglars instantly descended; although he did not yet speak italian, he
understood it very well. more dead than alive, he looked around him.
four men surrounded him, besides the postilion.

â€œ_di quÃ _,â€ said one of the men, descending a little path leading out of
the appian way. danglars followed his guide without opposition, and had
no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were
following him. still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal
distances from one another, like sentinels. after walking for about ten
minutes, during w

s to open their large dark eyes, like
those which we see on the faces of the dead. a sentinel struck the rings
of his carbine against his left hand. â€œwho comes there?â€ he cried.


â€œa friend, a friend!â€ said peppino; â€œbut where is the captain?â€

â€œthere,â€ said the sentinel, pointing over his shoulder to a spacious
crypt, hollowed out of the rock, the lights from which shone into the
passage through the large arched openings. â€œfine spoil, captain, fine
spoil!â€ said peppino in italian, and taking danglars by the collar of
his coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door, through which
they entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his
dwelling-place.

â€œis this the man?â€ asked the captain, who was attentively reading
plutarchâ€™s _life of alexander_.

â€œhimself, captain--himself.â€

â€œvery well, show him to me.â€

at this rather impertinent order, peppino raised his torch to the face
of danglars, who hastily withdrew that he might not have

â€œcome, my friend,â€ said danglars, seeing that he made no impression on
peppino, â€œyou will not refuse me a glass of wine?â€

â€œi have already told you that we do not sell at retail.â€

â€œwell, then, let me have a bottle of the least expensive.â€

â€œthey are all the same price.â€

â€œand what is that?â€

â€œtwenty-five thousand francs a bottle.â€

â€œtell me,â€ cried danglars, in a tone whose bitterness harpagon [*] alone
has been capable of revealing--â€œtell me that you wish to despoil me of
all; it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal.â€


* the miser in moliÃ¨reâ€™s comedy of _lâ€™avare_.--ed.

â€œit is possible such may be the masterâ€™s intention.â€

â€œthe master?--who is he?â€

â€œthe person to whom you were conducted yesterday.â€

â€œwhere is he?â€

â€œhere.â€

â€œlet me see him.â€

â€œcertainly.â€ and the next moment luigi vampa appeared before danglars.

â€œyou sent for me?â€ he said to the prisoner.

and since an opportunity presents itself----â€

â€œstay!â€ said the young man. â€œyou who love, and are beloved; you, who
have faith and hope,--oh, do not follow my example. in your case it
would be a crime. adieu, my noble and generous friend, adieu; i will go
and tell valentine what you have done for me.â€

and slowly, though without any hesitation, only waiting to press the
countâ€™s hand fervently, he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by
monte cristo. then they were both silent. ali, mute and attentive,
brought the pipes and coffee, and disappeared. by degrees, the light of
the lamps gradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held
them, and the perfumes appeared less powerful to morrel. seated opposite
to him, monte cristo watched him in the shadow, and morrel saw nothing
but the bright eyes of the count. an overpowering sadness took
possession of the young man, his hands relaxed their hold, the objects
in the room gradually lost their form and color, and his
