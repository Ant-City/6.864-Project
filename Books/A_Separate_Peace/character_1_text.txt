 had heard. at least the seventeen-year-old bunch could do it; but they had a crucial years advantage over us. no upper middler, which was the name for our class in the devon school, had ever tried. naturally finny was going to be the first to try, and just as naturally he was going to inveigle others, us, into trying it with him.we were not even upper middler exactly. for this was the summer session, just established to keep up with the pace of the war. we were in shaky transit that summer from the groveling status of lower middlers to the near-respectability of upper middlers. the class above, seniors, draft-bait, practically soldiers, rushed ahead of us toward the war. they were caught up in accelerat

ed courses and first-aid programs and a physical hardening regimen, which included jumping from this tree. we were still calmly, numbly reading virgil and playing tag in the river farther downstream. until finny thought of the tree.we stood looking up at it, four looks of consternation, one of excitement. do you want to go first? finny asked us, rhetorically. we just looked quietly back at him, and so he began taking off his clothes, stripping down to his underpants. for such an extraordinary athleteeven as a lower middler phineas had been the best athlete in the schoolhe was not spectacularly built. he was my heightfive feet eight and a half inches (i had been claiming five feet nine inches before he became my roommate, but he had said in public with that simple, shocking self-acceptance of his, no, youre the same height i a

ng sounds from the nearby woods came to me as though muffled and filtered. i must have been entering a mild state of shock. insulated by this, i took off my clothes and started to climb the pegs. i dont remember saying anything. the branch he had jumped from was slenderer than it looked from the ground and much higher. it was impossible to walk out on it far enough to be well over the river. i would have to spring far out or risk falling into the shallow water next to the bank. come on, drawled finny from below, stop standing there showing off. i recognized with automatic tenseness that the view was very impressive from here. when they torpedo the troopship, he shouted, you cant stand around admiring the view. jump!what was i doing up here anyway? why did i let finny talk me into stupid things like this? was he getting some kind of hold over me?jump!with the sensation that i was throwing my life away, i jumped into space. some tips of branches snapped past me and then i crashed into the

em, and such flows were one of finnys reasons for living.the real reason, sir, was that we just had to jump out of that tree. you know that tree  i knew, mr. prudhomme must have known, finny knew, if he stopped to think, that jumping out of the tree was even more forbidden than missing a meal. we had to do that, naturally, he went on, because were all getting ready for the war. what if they lower the draft age to seventeen? gene and i are both going to be seventeen at the end of the summer, which is a very convenient time since its the start of the academic year and theres never any doubt about which class you should be in. leper lepellier is already seventeen, and if im not mistak

 right, gene and i are perfectly all right. there isnt any question that we are conforming in every possible way to everything thats happening and everything thats going to happen. its all a question of birthdays, unless you want to be more specific and look at it from the sexual point of view, which i have never cared to do myself, since its a question of my mother and my father, and i have never felt i wanted to think about their sexual lives too much. everything he said was true and sincere; finny always said what he happened to be thinking, and if this stunned people then he was surprised.mr. prudhomme released his breath with a sort of amazed laugh, stared at finny for a while, and that was all there was to it.this was the way the masters tended to treat us that summer. they seemed to be modifying their usual attitude of floating, chronic disapproval. during the winter most of them regarded anything unexpected in a student with suspicion, seeming to feel that anything we said or did

was potentially illegal. now on these clear june days in new hampshire they appeared to uncoil, they seemed to believe that we were with them about half the time, and only spent the other half trying to make fools of them. a streak of tolerance was detectable; finny decided that they were beginning to show commendable signs of maturity.it was partly his doing. the devon faculty had never before experienced a student who combined a calm ignorance of the rules with a winning urge to be good, who seemed to love the school truly and deeply, and never more than when he was breaking the regulations, a model boy who was most comfortable in the truants corner. the faculty threw up its hands over phineas, and so loosened its grip on all of us.but there was anothe

hair they now gave his bold nose and cheekbones the sharp look of a prow.he alone talked easily. he discussed the bombing of central europe. no one else happened to have seen the story, and since phineas could not recall exactly what target in which country had been hit, or whether it was the american, british, or even russian air force which had hit it, or what day he read it in which newspaper, the discussion was one-sided.that didnt matter. it was the event which counted. but after a while finny felt he should carry the discussion to others. i think we ought to bomb the daylights out of them, as long as we dont hit any women or children or old people, dont you? he was saying to mrs. patch-withers, perched nervously behind her urn. or hospitals, he went on. and naturally no schools. or churches.we must also be careful about works of art, she put in, if they are of permanent value.a lot of nonsense, mr. patch-withers grumbled, with a flushed face. how do you expect our boys to be as pr

ted at that. mr. patch-withers face was reaching a brilliant shade, and his wifes head fell as though before the guillotine. even finny seemed to color a little, unless it was the reflection from his pink shirt. but his expression was composed, and he said in his resonant voice, i wore this, you see, because it goes with the shirt and it all ties in togetheri didnt mean that to be a pun, i dont think theyre very funny, especially in polite company, do you?it all ties in together with what weve been talking about, this bombing in central europe, because when you come right down to it the school is involved in everything that hap

ably the strangest tribute this school has had in a hundred and sixty years. he seemed pleased or amused in some unknown corner of his mind. phineas was going to get away with even this.his eyes gave their wider, magical gleam and his voice continued on a more compelling level, although i have to admit i didnt think of that when i put it on this morning. he smiled pleasantly after supplying this interesting additional information. mr. patch-withers settled into a hearty silence at this, and so finny added, im glad i put on something for a belt! i certainly would hate the embarrassment of having my pants fall down at the headmasters tea. of course he isnt here. but it would be just as embarrassing in front of you and mrs. patch-withers, and he smiled politely down at her.mr. patch-withers laughter surprised us all, including himself. his face, whose shades we had often labeled, now achieved a new one. phineas was very happy; sour and stern mr. patch-withers had been given a good laugh for

 unreal to us here, not because we couldnt imagine ita thousand newspaper photographs and newsreels had given us a pretty accurate idea of such a sightbut because our place here was too fair for us to accept something like that. we spent that summer in complete selfishness, im happy to say. the people in the world who could be selfish in the summer of 1942 were a small band, and im glad we took advantage of it.the first person who says anything unpleasant will get a swift kick in the ass, said finny reflectively as we came to the river.all right.are you still afraid to jump out of the tree?theres something unpleasant about that question, isnt there?that question? no, of course not. it depends on how you answer it.afraid to jump out of that tree? i expect itll be a very pleasant jump.after we had swum around in the water for a while finny said, will you do me the pleasure of jumping out of the tree first?my pleasure.rigid, i began climbing the rungs, slightly reassured by having fin

ce.was he trying to impress me or something? not tell anybody? when he had broken a school record without a day of practice? i knew he was serious about it, so i didnt tell anybody. perhaps for that reason his accomplishment took root in my mind and grew rapidly in the darkness where i was forced to hide it. the devon school record books contained a mistake, a lie, and nobody knew it but finny and me. a. hopkins parker was living in a fools paradise, wherever he was. his defeated name remained in bronze on the school record plaque, while finny deliberately evaded an athletic honor. it was true that he had many alreadythe winslow galbraith memorial football trophy for having brought the most christian sportsmanship to the game during the 1941-1942 season, the margaret duke bonaventura ribbon and prize for the student who conducted himself at hockey most like the way her son had done,

the devon school contact sport award, presented each year to that student who in the opinion of the athletic advisors excels his fellows in the sportsmanlike performance of any game involving bodily contact. but these were in the past, and they were prizes, not school records. the sports finny played officiallyfootball, hockey, baseball, lacrossedidnt have school records. to switch to a new sport suddenly, just for a day, and immediately break a record in itthat was about as neat a trick, as dazzling a reversal as i could, to be perfectly honest, possibly imagine. there was something inebriating in the suppleness of this feat. when i thought about it my head felt a little dizzy and my stomach began to tingle. it had, in one word, glamour, absolute schoolboy glamour. when i looked dow

n at that stop watch and realized a split second before i permitted my face to show it or my voice to announce it that finny had broken a school record, i had experienced a feeling that also can be described in one wordshock.to keep silent about this amazing happening deepened the shock for me. it made finny seem too unusual fornot friendship, but too unusual for rivalry. and there were few relationships among us at devon not based on rivalry.swimming in pools is screwy anyway, he said after a long, unusual silence as we walked toward the dormitory. the only real swimming is in the ocean. then in the everyday, mediocre tone he used when he was proposing something really outrageous, he added, lets go to the beach.the beach was hours away by bicycle, forbidden, completely out of all bounds. going t

here risked expulsion, destroyed the studying i was going to do for an important test the next morning, blasted the reasonable amount of order i wanted to maintain in my life, and it also involved the kind of long, labored bicycle ride i hated. all right, i said.we got our bikes and slipped away from devon along a back road. having invited me finny now felt he had to keep me entertained. he told long, wild stories about his childhood; as i pumped panting up steep hills he glided along beside me, joking steadily. he analyzed my character, and he insisted on knowing what i disliked most about him (youre too conventional, i said). he rode backward with no hands, he rode on his own handlebars, he jumped off and back on his moving bike as he had seen trick horseback riders do in the movies. he sang. despite the steady musical undertone in his

speaking voice finny couldnt carry a tune, and he couldnt remember the melody or the words to any song. but he loved listening to music, any music, and he liked to sing.we reached the beach late in the afternoon. the tide was high and the surf was heavy. i dived in and rode a couple of waves, but they had reached that stage of power in which you could feel the whole strength of the ocean in them. the second wave, as it tore toward the beach with me, spewed me a little ahead of it, encroaching rapidly; suddenly it

was immeasurably bigger than i was, it rushed me from the control of gravity and took control of me itself; the wave threw me down in a primitive plunge without a bottom, then there was a bottom, grinding sand, and i skidded onto the shore. the wave hesitated, balanced there, and then hissed back toward the deep water, its tentacles not quite interested enough in me to drag me with it.i made my way up on the beach and lay down. finny came, ceremoniously took my pulse, and then went back into the ocean. he stayed in an hour, breaking off every few minutes to come back to me and talk. the sand was so hot from the all-day sunshine that i had to brush the top layer away in order to lie down on it, and finnys progress across the beach became a series of high, startled leaps.the ocean, throwing up foaming sun-sprays across some nearby rocks, was winter cold. this kind of sunshine and ocean, with the accumulating roar of the surf

everything he could think of for me.we had dinner at a hot dog stand, with our backs to the ocean and its now cooler wind, our faces toward the heat of the cooking range. then we walked on toward the center of the beach, where there was a subdued new england strip of honky-tonks. the boardwalk lights against the deepening blue sky gained an ideal, starry beauty and the lights from the belt of honky-tonks and shooting galleries and beer gardens gleamed with a quiet purity in the clear twilight.finny and i went along the boardwalk in our sneakers and white slacks, finny in a light blue polo shirt and i in a t-shirt. i noticed that people were looking fixedly at him, so i took a look myself to see why. his skin radiated a reddish copper glow of tan, his brown hair had been a little bleached by the sun, and i noticed that the tan made his eyes shine with a cool blue-green fire.everybodys staring at you, he suddenly said to me. its because of that movie-star tan you picked up this afternoon

showing off again.enough broken rules were enough that night. neither of us suggested going into any of the honky-tonks or beer gardens. we did have one glass of beer each at a fairly respectable-looking bar, convincing, or seeming to convince the bartender that we were old enough by a show of forged draft cards. then we found a good spot among some sand dunes at the lonely end of the beach, and there we settled down to sleep for the night. the last words of finnys usual nighttime monologue were, i hope youre having a pretty good time here. i know i kind of dragged you away at the point of a gun, but after all you cant come to the shore with just anybody and you cant come by yourself, and at this teen-age period in life the proper person is your best pal. he hesitated and then added, which is what you are, and there was silence on his dune.it was a courageous thing to say. exposing a sincere emotion nakedly like that at the devon school was the next thi

 time ticking steadily. i looked at the sky and the ocean and knew that it was around six-thirty. the ride back to devon would take three hours at least. my important test, trigonometry, was going to be held at ten oclock.phineas woke up talking. that was one of the best nights sleep i ever had.when did you ever have a bad one?the time i broke my ankle in football. i like the way this beach looks now. shall we have a morning swim?are you crazy? its too late for that.what time is it anyway? finny knew i was a walking clock.its going on seven oclock.theres time for just a short swim, and before i could say anything he was trotting down the beach, shedding clothes as he went, and into the ocean. i waited for him where i was. he came back after a while full of chilly glow and energy and talk. i didnt have much to say. do you have the money? i asked once, suddenly suspecting that he had lost our joint seventy-five cents during the night. there was a search, a hopeless one, in the sand, an

d so we set off on the long ride back without any breakfast, and got to devon just in time for my test. i flunked it; i knew i was going to as soon as i looked at the test problems. it was the first test i had ever flunked.but finny gave me little time to worry about that. eight after lunch there was a game of blitzball which took most of the afternoon, and right after dinner there was the meeting of the super suicide society of the summer session.that night in our room, even though i was worn out from all the exercise, i tried to catch up to what had been happening in trigonometry.you work too hard, finny said, sitting opposite me at the table where we read. the study lamp cast a round yellow pool between us. you know a

er in the lamplight i could discern a slight mound in his brow above the eyebrows, the faint bulge which is usually believed to indicate mental power. phineas would be the first to disclaim any great mental power in himself. but what did go on in his mind? if i was the head of the class and won that prize, then we would be even.his head started to come up, and mine snapped down. i glared at the textbook. relax, he said. your brainll explode if you keep this up.you dont need to worry about me, finny.im not worried.you wouldnt i wasnt sure i had the control to put this questionmind if i wound up head of the class, would you?mind? two clear green-blue eyes looked at me. fat chance youve got, anyway, with chet douglass around.but you wouldnt mind, would you? i repeated in a lower and more distinct voice.he gave me that half-smile of his, which had won him a thousand conflicts. id kill myself out of jealous envy.i believed him. the joking manner was a screen; i believed him. in front of

ce, something surviving in the ruins.i found it. i found a single sustaining thought. the thought was, you and phineas are even already. you are even in enmity. you are both coldly driving ahead for yourselves alone. you did hate him for breaking that school swimming record, but so what? he hated you for getting an a in every course but one last term. you would have had an a in that one except for him. except for him.then a second realization broke as clearly and bleakly as dawn at the beach. finny had deliberately set out to wreck my studies. that explained blitzball, that explained the nightly meetings of the super suicide society, that explained his insistence that i share all his diversions. the way i believed that youre-my-best-friend blabber! the shadow falling across his face if i didnt want to do something with him! his instinct for sharing everything with me? sure, he wanted to share everything with me, especially his procession of ds in every subject. that way he, the great athl

go on hearing about it much longer. if anyone had been suspicious of me, i might have developed some strength to defend myself. but there was nothing. no one suspected. phineas must still be too sick, or too noble, to tell them.i spent as much time as i could alone in our room, trying to empty my mind of every thought, to forget where i was, even who i was. one evening when i was dressing for dinner in this numbed frame of mind, an idea occurred to me, the first with any energy behind it since finny fell from the tree. i decided to put on his clothes. we wore the same size, and although he always criticized mine he used to wear them frequently, quickly forgetting what belonged to him and what to me. i never forgot, and that evening i put on his cordovan shoes, his pants, and i looked for and finally found his pink shirt, neatly laundered in a drawer. its high, somewhat stiff collar against my neck, the wide cuffs touching my wrists, the rich material against my skin excited a sense of stra

t i am.whats he talking about, said finny.the room was bitterly cold. i stood trembling in front of phineas, still holding his crutches in place, unable to turn and face brinker and this joke he had gotten into his head, this catastrophic joke.he wants to know if ill sign up with him, i said, enlist. it was the ultimate question for all seventeen-year-olds that year, and it drove brinkers insinuations from every mind but mine.yeah, said brinker.enlist! cried finny at the same time. his large and clear eyes turned with an odd expression on me. i had never seen such a look in them before. after looking at me closely he said, youre going to enlist?well i just thoughtlast night after the railroad workyou thought you might sign up? he went on, looking carefully away.brinker drew one of his deep senatorial breaths, but he found nothing to say. we three stood shivering in the thin new hampshire morning light, finny and i in pajamas, brinker in a blue flannel

part of our conversation worth preserving. brinker hadley had been tagged with a nickname at last, after four years of creating them for others and eluding one himself. yellow peril hadley swept through the school with the speed of a flu epidemic, and it must be said to his credit that brinker took it well enough except when, in its inevitable abbreviation, people sometimes called him yellow instead of peril.but in a week i had forgotten that, and i have never since forgotten the dazed look on finnys face when he thought that on the first day of his return to devon i was going to desert him. i didnt know why he had chosen me, why it was only to me that he could show the most humbling sides of his handicap. i didnt care. for the war was no longer eroding the peaceful summertime stillness i had prized so much at devon, and although the playing fields were crusted under a foot of congealed snow and the river was now a hard gray-white lane of ice between gaunt trees, peace had come back to dev

ering power and size as it bore on us, overwhelming in its rush, seemingly inescapable, and then at the last moment eluded by a word from phineas; i had simply ducked, that was all, and the waves concentrated power had hurtled harmlessly overhead, no doubt throwing others roughly up on the beach, but leaving me peaceably treading water as before. i did not stop to think that one wave is inevitably followed by another even larger and more powerful, when the tide is coming in.i like the winter, finny assured me for the fourth time, as we came back from chapel that morning.well, it doesnt like you. wooden plank walks had been placed on many of the school paths for better footing, but there were icy patches everywhere on them. a crutch misplaced and he could be thrown down upon the frozen wooden planking, or into the ice-encrusted snow.even indoors devon was a nest of traps for him. the school had been largely rebuilt with a massive bequest from an oil family some years before in a peculiar

on the move. he hobbled now among the patches of ice. there was the one certainty that dr. stanpole had givenphineas would walk again. but the thought was there before me that he would never walk like that again.do you have a class? he said as we reached the steps of the building.yes.so do i. lets not go.not go? but whatll we use for an excuse?well say i fainted from exertion on the way from chapel, he looked at me with a phantoms smile, and you had to tend me.this is your first day back, finny. youre no one to cut classes.i know, i know. im going to work. i really am going to work. youre going to pull me through mostly, but i am going to work as hard as i can. only not today, not the first thing. not now, not conjugating verbs when i havent even looked at the school yet. i want to see this place, i havent seen anything except the inside of our room, and the inside of chapel. i dont feel like seeing the inside of a classroom. not now. not yet.what do you want to see?he had started

the first, had been the one historical figure phineas refused absolutely to believe in. lost two thousand years in the past, master of a dead language and a dead empire, the bane and bore of schoolboys, caesar he believed to be more of a tyrant at devon than he had ever been in rome. phineas felt a personal and sincere grudge against caesar, and he was outraged most by his conviction that caesar and rome and latin had never been alive at all  if you really think there ever was a caesar, i said.finny got up from the cot, picking up his cane as an afterthought. he looked oddly at me, his face set to burst out laughing i thought. naturally i dont believe books and i dont believe teachers, he came across a few paces, but i do believeits important after all for me to believe you. christ, ive got to believe you, at least. i know you better than anybody. i waited without saying anything. and you told me about leper, that hes gone crazy. thats the word, we might as well admit it. lepers gone crazy

ed in mr. carharts urbane murmur, let us pray.we all slumped immediately and unthinkingly into the awkward crouch in which god was addressed at devon, leaning forward with elbows on knees. brinker had caught us, and in a moment it was too late to escape, for he had moved swiftly into the lords prayer. if when brinker had said let us pray i had said go to hell everything might have been saved.at the end there was an indecisive, semiserious silence and then brinker said, phineas, if you please. finny got up with a shrug and walked to the center of the floor, between us and the platform. brinker got an armchair from behind the balustrade, and seated finny on it with courtly politeness. now just in your own words, he said.what own words? said phineas, grimacing up at him with his best you-are-an-idiot expression.i know you havent got many of your own, said brinker with a charitable smile. use some of genes then.what shall i talk about? you? ive got plenty of words of my own for that.im al

 turning over in his mind for a long time. i could tell that because the obstinate, competitive look left his face as his mind became engaged for the first time. its very funny, he said, but ever since then ive had a feeling that the tree did it by itself. its an impression ive had. almost as though the tree shook me out by itself.the acoustics in the assembly room were so poor that silences there had a heavy hum of their own.someone else was in the tree, isnt that so?no, said finny spontaneously, i dont think so. he looked at the ceiling. or was there? maybe there was somebody climbing up the rungs of the trunk. i kind of forget.this time the hum of silence was prolonged to a point where i would be forced to fill it with some kind of sound if it didnt end. then someone else on the platform spoke up. i thought somebody told me that gene forrester wasfinny was there, brinker interrupted commandingly, he knows better than anyone.you were there too, werent you, gene? this

new voice from the platform continued.yes, i said with interest, yes, i was there too.were younear the tree?finny turned toward me. you were down at the bottom, werent you? he asked, not in the official courtroom tone he had used before, but in a friends voice.i had been studying very carefully the way my hands wrinkled when tightly clenched, but i was able to bring my head up and return his inquiring look. down at the bottom, yes.finny went on. did you see the tree shake or anything? he flushed faintly at what seemed to him the absurdity of his own question. ive always meant to ask you, just for the hell of it.i took this under consideration. i dont recall anything like that nutty question, he muttered.i thought you were in the tree, the platform voice cut in.well of course, finny said with an exasperated chuckle, of course i was in the treeoh you mean gene?he wasnt inis that what you mean, or finny floundered with muddle

much, his voice tried for a hard compromise, full of warning and yet striving to pass unnoticed by the others.no, were not accusing you, a boy on the platform said evenly, and then i stood accused.i think i remember now! finny broke in, his eyes bright and relieved. yes, i remember seeing you standing on the bank. you were looking up and your hair was plastered down over your forehead so that you had that dumb look you always have when youve been in the waterwhat was it you said? stop posing up there or one of those best-pal cracks youre always making. he was very happy. and i think i did start to pose just to make you madder, and i said, what did i say? something about the two of us  yes, i said lets make a double j

t only a night nurse would be at the infirmary, did not waste time going there but rushed to bring dr. stanpole from his house. others remembered that phil latham, the wrestling coach, lived just across the common and that he was an expert in first aid. it was phil who made finny stretch out on one of the wide shallow steps of the staircase, and kept him still until dr. stanpole arrived.the foyer and the staircase of the first building were soon as crowded as at midday. phil latham found the main light switch, and all the marble blazed up under full illumination. but surrounding it was the stillness of near-midnight in a country town, so that the hurrying feet and the repressed voices had a hollow reverberance. the windows, blind and black, retained their look of dull

ave meant a lot to me. but phineas might begin to curse me with every word he knew, he might lose his head completely, he would certainly be worse off for it. so i kept out of the way.he was entirely conscious and from the glimpses i caught of his face seemed to be fairly calm. everyone behaved with complete presence of mind, and that included phineas.when dr. stanpole arrived there was silence on the stairs. wrapped tightly in his blanket, with light flooding down on him from the chandelier, finny lay isolated at the center of a tight circle of faces. the rest of the crowd looked on from above or below on the stairs, and i stood on the lower edge. behind me the foyer was now empty.after a short, silent examination dr. stanpole had a chair brought from the assembly room, and finny was lifted cautiously into it. people arent ordinarily carried in chairs in new hampshire, and as they raised him up he looked very strange to me, like some tragic and exalted personage, a stricken pontiff. onc

 coming out of the anaesthesia.i left the infirmary and went to my 10:10 class, which was on american history. mr. patch-withers gave us a five-minute written quiz on the necessary and proper clause of the constitution. at 11 oclock i left that building and crossed the center common where a few students were already lounging although it was still a little early in the season for that. i went into the first building, walked up the stairs where finny had fallen, and joined my 11:10 class, which was in mathematics. we were given a ten-minute trigonometry problem which appeared to solve itself on my paper.at 12 i left the first building, recrossed the common and went into the jared potter building for lunch. it was a breaded veal cutlet, spinach, mashed potatoes, and prune whip. at the table we discussed whether there was any saltpeter in the mashed potatoes. i defended the negative.after lunch i walked back to the dormitory with brinker. h

e alluded to last night only by asking how phineas was; i said he seemed to be in good spirits. i went on to my room and read the assigned pages of le bourgeois gentilhomme. at 2:30 i left my room, and walking along one side of the oval finny had used for my track workouts during the winter, i reached the far common and beyond it the gym. i went past the trophy room, downstairs into the pungent air of the locker room, changed into gym pants, and spent an hour wrestling. i pinned my opponent once and he pinned me once. phil latham showed me an involved method of escape in which you executed a modified somersault over your opponents back. he started to talk about the accident but i concentrated on the escape method and the subject was

xplanation. the only one. there are risks, there are always risks. an operating room is a place where the risks are just more formal than in other places. an operating room and a war. and i noticed that his self-control was breaking up. why did it have to happen to you boys so soon, here at devon?the marrow of his bone  i repeated aimlessly. this at last penetrated my mind. phineas had died from the marrow of his bone flowing down his blood stream to his heart.i did not cry then or ever about finny. i did not cry even when i stood watching him being lowered into his familys strait-laced burial ground outside of boston. i could not escape a feeling that this was my own funeral, and you do not cry in that case.chapter 13the quadrangle surrounding the far common was never considered absolutely essential to the devon school. the essence was elsewhere, in the older, uglier, more comfortable halls enclosing the center common. there the schools history had unrolled, the fabled riot scenes and

els left out, being too old this time.left out! brinker s eyes lighted up. left out! he and his crowd are responsible for it! and were going to fight it!i had heard this generation-complaint from brinker before, so often that i finally identified this as the source of his disillusionment during the winter, this generalized, faintly self-pitying resentment against millions of people he did not know. he did know his father, however, and so they were not getting along well now. in a way this was finnys view, except that naturally he saw it comically, as a huge and intensely practical joke, played by fat and foolish old men bungling away behind the scenes.i could never agree with either of them. it would have been comfortable, but i could not believe it. because it seemed clear that wars were not made by generations and their special stupidities, but that wars were made instead by something ignorant in the human heart.brinker went upstairs to continue his packing, and i walked over to the g

 over now. happiness had disappeared along with rubber, silk, and many other staples, to be replaced by the wartime synthetic, high morale, for the duration.at the gym a platoon was undressing in the locker room. the best that could be said for them physically was that they looked wiry in their startling sets of underwear, which were the color of moss.i never talked about phineas and neither did anyone else; he was, however, present in every moment of every day since dr, stanpole had told me. finny had a vitality which could not be quenched so suddenly, even by the marrow of his bone. that was why i couldnt say anything or listen to anything about him, because he endured so forcefully that what i had to say would have seemed crazy to anyone elsei could not use the past tense, for instanceand what they had to say would be incomprehensible to me. during the time i was with him, phineas created an atmosphere in which i continued now to live, a way of sizing up the world with erratic and enti
