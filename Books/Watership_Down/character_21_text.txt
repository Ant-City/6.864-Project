hese, buckthorn, hazel knew well. he was glad to see him,
for he knew him for a tough, sturdy fellow who was considered certain to get into
the owsla as soon as he reached full weight.
     "but i dare say he's impatient," thought hazel, "or he may have come off worst
in some scuffle over a doe and taken it hard. well, with him and bigwig, at least
we shan't be too badly off if we run into any fighting."
     he did not recognize the other two rabbits and when blackberry told him their
names -- speedwell and acorn -- he was none the wiser. but this was not
surprising, for they were typical outskirters -- thin-looking six-monthers, with the
strained, wary look of those who are only too well used to the thin end of the
stick. they looked curiously at fiver. from what blackberry had told them, they
had been almost expecting to find fiver foretelling doom in a poetic torrent.
instead, he seemed more calm and normal than the rest. the certainty of going
had lifted a weight from fiver.

 worse than i am."
     "cross it?" cried bigwig. "cross it? who's going to cross it? what do you want
to cross it for? i never heard such nonsense."
     like all wild animals, rabbits can swim if they have to; and some even swim
when it suits them. rabbits have been known to live on the edge of a wood and
regularly swim a brook to feed in the fields beyond. but most rabbits avoid
swimming, and certainly an exhausted rabbit could not swim the enborne.
     "i don't want to jump in there," said speedwell.
     "why not just go along the bank?" asked hawkbit.
     hazel suspected that if fiver felt they ought to cross the river, it might be
dangerous not to. but how were the others to be persuaded? at this moment, as
he was still wondering what to say to them, he suddenly realized that something
had lightened his spirits. what could it be? a smell? a sound? then he knew.
nearby, across the river, a lark had begun to twitter and climb. it was morning. a
blackbird called one or two deep, slow note

     "you've got a big thorn in there, hlao," he said. "no wonder you couldn't run.
we'll have to get it out."
     getting the thorn out was not easy, for the foot had become so tender that
pipkin winced and pulled away even from hazel's tongue. but after a good deal of
patient effort hazel succeeded in working out enough of the stump to get a grip
with his teeth. the thorn came out smoothly and the wound bled. the spine was
so long and thick that hawkbit, who happened to be close by, woke speedwell to
have a look at it.
     "frith above, pipkin!" said speedwell, sniffing at the thorn where it lay on a
pebble. "you'd better collect a few more like that: then you can make a notice
board and frighten fiver. you might have poked the lendri's eye out for us, if
you'd only known."
     "lick the place, hlao," said hazel. "lick it until it feels better and then go to

uld get a clear view ahead, he heard a movement behind
him and turned to find hawkbit at his shoulder. there was something furtive and
hesitant about him and hazel glanced at him sharply, wondering for a moment
whether he could have sickness or poison on him. "er -- hazel," said hawkbit,
looking past him into the face of the dreary black cliff. "i -- er -- that is to say we
-- er -- feel that we -- well, that we can't go on like this. we've had enough of it."
     he stopped. hazel now saw that speedwell and acorn were behind him,
listening expectantly. there was a pause.
     "go on, hawkbit," said speedwell, "or shall i?"
     "more than enough," said hawkbit, with a kind of foolish importance.
     "well, so have i," answered hazel, "and i hope there won't be much more.
then we can all have a rest."
     "we want to stop now," said speedwell. "we think it was stupid to come so
far."
     "it gets worse and worse the further we go," said acorn. "where are we going

     "look here," said hazel, "suppose you tell me what you want to do and i'll tell
you what i think about it."
     "we want to go back," said acorn. "we think fiver was wrong."
     "how can you go back through all we've come through?" replied hazel. "and
probably get killed for wounding an owsla officer, if you ever do get back? talk
sense, for frith's sake."
     "it wasn't we who wounded holly," said speedwell.
     "you were there and blackberry brought you there. do you think they won't

remember that? besides--"
     hazel stopped as fiver approached, followed by bigwig.
     "hazel," said fiver, "could you come up on the bank with me for a few
moments? it's important."
     "and while you're there," said bigwig, scowling round at the others from under
the great sheaf of fur on his head, "i'll just have a few words with these three.

trap. and as for you, speedwell--"
     hazel did not wait to hear what speedwell looked like. following fiver, he
scrambled up the lumps and shelves of peat to the overhang of gravelly earth and
thin grass that topped them. as soon as fiver had found a place to clamber out,
he led the way along the edge to the bank which hazel had been looking at before
hawkbit spoke to him. it stood a few feet above the nodding, windy heather and
was open and grassy at the top. they climbed it and squatted down. to their right
the moon, smoky and yellow in thin night cloud, stood over a cl

     when hazel and fiver reached the floor of the hollow they found blackberry
wailing for them, crouching on the peat and nibbling at a few brown stalks of
sedge grass.
     "hello," said hazel. "what's happened? where are the others?"
     "over there," answered blackberry. "there's been a fearful row. bigwig told
hawkbit and speedwell that he'd scratch them to pieces if they didn't obey him.
and when hawkbit said he wanted to know who was chief rabbit, bigwig bit
him. it seems a nasty business. who is chief rabbit, anyway -- you or bigwig?"
     "i don't know," answered hazel, "but bigwig's certainly the strongest. there
was no need to go biting hawkbit: he couldn't have gone back if he'd tried. he
and his friends would have seen that if they'd been allowed to talk for a bit. now

there are too few of us for giving orders and biting people. frith in a fog! isn't
there enough trouble and danger already?"
     they went over to the far end of the pit. bigwig and silver were talking with
buckthorn under an overhanging broom. nearby, pipkin and dandelion were
pretending to feed on a patch of scrub. some way away, acorn was making a great

business of licking hawkbit's throat, while speedwell watched.
     "keep still if you can, poor old chap," said acorn, who obviously wanted to be
overheard. "just let me clean the blood out. steady, now!" hawkbit winced in an
exaggerated manner and backed away. as hazel came up, all the rabbits turned
and stared at him expectantly.
     "look," said hazel, "i know there's been some trouble, but the best thing will
be to try to forget it. this is a bad place, but we'll soon get out of it."
     "do you really think we will?" asked dandelion.

ook the wet from his fur. he could see fiver's hills plainly now, greenish-gray
and seeming close in the rain-laden air. he could even pick out the dots of furze
bushes and stunted yew trees on the steep slopes. as he gazed at them, he heard
an excited voice further down the track.
     "he's done it! didn't i tell you he'd do it?"
     hazel turned his head and saw blackberry on the path. he was bedraggled and
exhausted, but it was he who was speaking. out of the heather behind him came
acorn, speedwell and buckthorn. all four rabbits were now staring straight at
him. he wondered why. then, as they approached, he realized that they were
looking not at him, but past him at something further off. he turned round. the
gravel track led downhill into a narrow belt of silver birch and rowan. beyond was
a thin hedge; and beyond that, a green field between two copses. they had
reached the other side of the common.
     "oh, hazel," said blackberry, coming up to him round a puddle in the gravel. "i

solitude where they crept, a place desolate as a crack in the ground, opens like a
rose and stretches to the hills and the sky.
     the tired rabbits fed and basked in the sunny meadow as though they had
come no further than from the bank at the edge of the nearby copse. the heather
and the stumbling darkness were forgotten as though the sunrise had melted
them. bigwig and hawkbit chased each other through the long grass. speedwell
jumped over the little brook that ran down the middle of the field and when
acorn tried to follow him and fell short, silver joked with him as he scrambled
out and rolled him in a patch of dead oak leaves until he was dry. as the sun rose
higher, shortening the shadows and drawing the dew from the grass, most of the
rabbits came wandering back to the sun-flecked shade among the cow parsley
along the edge of the ditch. here, hazel and fiver were sitting with dandelion

bigwig, cheerful at the prospect of action. the steady, reliable silver. dandelion,
the dashing storyteller, so eager to be off that he jumped the ditch and ran a little
way into the field before stopping to wait for the rest. buckthorn, perhaps the
most sensible and staunch of them all. pipkin, who looked round for hazel and
then came over to wait beside him. acorn, hawkbit and speedwell, decent
enough rank-and-filers as long as they were not pushed beyond their limits. last
of all came fiver, dejected and reluctant as a sparrow in the frost. as hazel turned
from the hole, the clouds in the west broke slightly and there was a sudden dazzle
of watery, pale gold light.
     "o el-ahrairah!" thought hazel. "these are rabbits we're going to meet. you
know them as well as you know us. let it be the right thing that i'm doing."
     "now, brace up, fiver!" he said aloud. "we're waiti

   "to the hills," he said.
     south of them, the ground rose gently away from the brook. along the crest
was the line of a cart track and beyond, a copse. hazel turned toward it and the
rest began to follow him up the slope in ones and twos.
     "what about the wire, bigwig?" said silver. "the peg will catch and tighten it
again."
     "no, it's loose now," said bigwig "i could shake it off if i hadn't hurt my neck."
     "try," said silver. "you won't get far otherwise."
     "hazel," said speedwell suddenly, "there's a rabbit coming down from the
warren. look!"
     "only one?" said bigwig. "what a pity! you take him, silver. i won't deprive
you. make a good job of it while you're at it."
     they stopped and waited, dotted here and there about the slope. the rabbit
who was coming was running in a curious, headlong manner. once he ran
straight into a thick-stemmed thistle, knocking himself sideways and rolling over
and over. but he got up and came blundering on toward them.

out northward toward the bright, still fields and the dim pylon line stalking away
into the distance north of kingsclere. the air was cooler and the sun was
beginning once more to reach the north escarpment.

     "i think we've done enough," he said, "for today, anyway. i should like to go
down to the bottom of the hill and find some really good grass. this stuff's all
right in its way but it's rather thin and dry. does anyone feel like coming with
me?"
     bigwig, dandelion and speedwell were ready, but the others preferred to graze
their way back to the thorn trees and go underground with the sun. bigwig and
hazel picked the line that offered most cover and, with the others following, set
out on the four or five hundred yards to the foot of the hill. they met no trouble
and were soon feeding in the grass at the edge of the wheatfield, the very picture
of rabbits in an evening landscape. hazel, tired though he was, did not forget to
look for somewhere to bolt if there should be

chafer droned past. the grasshoppers had fallen silent.
     "owls'll be out," said bigwig. "let's go up again."
     at this moment, from out in the darkening field, there came the sound of a
stamp on the ground. it was followed by another, closer to them, and they caught
a glimpse of a white tail. they both immediately ran to the ditch. now that they
had to use it in earnest, they found it even narrower than they had thought. there
was just room to turn round at the far end and as they did so speedwell and
dandelion tumbled in behind them.
     "what is it?" asked hazel. "what did you hear?"
     "there's something coming up the line of the hedge," replied speedwell. "an

animal. making a lot of noise, too."
     "did you see it?"
     "no, and i couldn't smell it either. it's downwind. but i heard it plainly
enough."
     "i heard it, too," said dandelion. "something fairly big -- as big as a rabbit,
anyway -- moving clumsily but trying to keep concealed, or so it seemed to me."
     "homba

s you heard, we'd better not risk going out."
     "listen," said dandelion. "what's that?"
     for a moment hazel could hear nothing. then he caught a distant but clear
sound -- a kind of wailing or crying, wavering and intermittent. although it did
not sound like any sort of hunting call, it was so unnatural that it filled him with
fear. as he listened, it ceased.
     "what in frith's name makes a noise like that?" said bigwig, his great fur cap
hackling between his ears.
     "a cat?" said speedwell, wide-eyed.
     "that's no cat!" said bigwig, his lips drawn back in a stiffened, unnatural
grimace, "that's no cat! don't you know what it is? your mother--" he broke off.
then he said, very low, "your mother told you, didn't she?"
     "no!" cried dandelion. "no! it's some bird -- some rat -- wounded--"
     bigwig stood up. his back was arched and his head nodded on his stiffened
neck.

led himself together. whatever the explanation might be, the
immediate need was to take first things first. they were in open country, at night,
away from any refuge but an overgrown ditch, with a rabbit who smelled of blood,
was crying uncontrollably and looked as though he could not move. there might
very well be a stoat on his trail at this moment. if they were going to help him
they had better be quick.
     "go and tell bigwig who it is," he said to dandelion, "and come back with him.
send speedwell up the hill to the others and tell him to make it clear that no one
is to come down. they couldn't help and it would only add to the risk."
     dandelion had no sooner gone than hazel became aware that something else
was moving in the hedge. but he had no time to wonder what it might be, for
almost immediately another rabbit appeared and limped to where holly was
lying.
     "you must help us if you can," he said to hazel. "we've had a very bad time and
my master's ill. can we get underground

arate, himself
remaining with holly and bluebell while bigwig and dandelion went out to either
side. holly was forced to stop several times and hazel, full of fear, had hard work
to suppress his impatience. only when the moon began to rise -- the edge of its
great disc growing brighter and brighter on the skyline below and behind them --
did he at last beg holly to hurry. as he spoke he saw, in the white light, pipkin
coming down to meet them.
     "what are you doing?" he said sternly. "i told speedwell no one was to come
down."
     "it isn't speedwell's fault," said pipkin. "you stood by me at the river, so i
thought i'd come and look for you, hazel. anyway, the holes are just here. is it
really captain holly you've found?"
     bigwig and dandelion approached.
     "i'll tell you what," said bigwig. "these two will need to rest for a good long
time. suppose pipkin here and dandelion take them to an empty burrow and stay
with them as long as they want? the rest of us had better keep away unt

and bluebell is with him -- no one else. they're in a bad way and they're not to be
troubled. we'll leave this hole empty for them. now i'm going underground
myself and so will you if you've got any sense."
     but before he went, bigwig turned to hazel and said, "you got yourself out of
that ditch down there instead of me, didn't you, hazel? i shan't forget that."
     hazel remembered buckthorn's leg and took him down with him. speedwell

and silver followed them.
     "i say, what's happened, hazel?" asked silver. "it must be something very bad.
holly would never leave the threarah."
     "i don't know," replied hazel, "and neither does anyone else yet. we'll have to
wait until tomorow. holly may stop running, but i don't think bluebell will. now
let me alone to do this leg of buckthorn's."
     the wound was a great deal better and soon hazel fell asleep.

     almost all the rabbits had followed them down. the honeycomb, though big
enough for everybody, was not so airy as the great burrow and on this june
evening it seemed somewhat close.
     "we can easily make it cooler, you know," said strawberry to hazel. "in the
great burrow they used to open tunnels for the summer and close them for the
winter. we can dig another run on the evening side tomorrow and pick up the
breeze."
     hazel was just going to ask holly to begin when speedwell came down the
eastern run. "hazel," he said, "your -- er -- visitor -- your mouse. he wants to
speak to you."
     "oh, i'd forgotten him," said hazel. "where is he?"
     "up the run."
     hazel went up. the mouse was waiting at the top.
     "you go now?" said hazel. "you think safe?"
     "go now," said the mouse. "no wait owl. but a what i like a say. you 'elp a

hardly a full day had elapsed since holly had come crawling in delirium to the
foot of watership down. yet already he was near recovery, while the more light-
hearted bluebell seemed even less the worse for the dreadful catastrophe that he
had survived. hazel and his companions had suffered extremes of grief and
horror during the telling of holly's tale. pipkin had cried and trembled piteously
at the death of scabious, and acorn and speedwell had been seized with
convulsive choking as bluebell told of the poisonous gas that murdered
underground. yet, as with primitive humans, the very strength and vividness of
their sympathy brought with it a true release. their feelings were not false or
assumed. while the story was being told, they heard it without any of the reserve
or detachment that the kindest of civilized humans retains as he reads his
newspaper. to themselves, they seemed to struggle in the poisoned runs and to

     as the rabbits came up by the hole inside the beech wood, a swift gust of wind

passed through the leaves, checkering and dappling the ground beneath, stealing
and giving light under the branches. they listened, but beyond the rustle of the
leaves there came from the open down outside no sound except the monotonous
tremolo of a grasshopper warbler, far off in the grass.
     "what a moon!" said silver. "let's enjoy it while it's here."
     as they went over the bank they met speedwell and hawkbit returning.
     "oh, hazel," said hawkbit, "we've been talking to another mouse. he'd heard
about the kestrel this evening and was very friendly. he told us about a place just
the other side of the wood where the grass has been cut short -- something to do
with horses, he said. 'you like a nice a grass? 'e very fine grass.' so we went there.

was secretly disappointed not to have gone on the expedition with holly; and
when the other two pointed out that they were relying on him to tell them how to
get the hutch open, he agreed to come.
     "do we need to take everyone?" he asked. "you say the dog's tied up and i
suppose there can't be more than three cats. too many rabbits will only be a
nuisance in the dark: someone will get lost and we shall have to spend time
looking for him."
     "well, dandelion, speedwell and hawkbit, then," said bigwig, "and leave the
others behind. do you mean to go tonight, hazel-rah?"
     "yes, the sooner the better," said hazel. "get hold of those three and tell them.

sour smell of flowering privet from cottage hedges below. hazel sa

had on the may evening when hazel first climbed the down. but now they were
higher and smaller, settling at last into a mackerel sky like a beach at low tide.
hazel took bigwig and blackberry to the edge of the escarpment, whence they
could look across to nuthanger on its little hill. he described the approach and
went on to explain how the rabbit hutch was to be found. bigwig was in high
spirits. the wind and the prospect of action excited him and he spent some time
with dandelion, hawkbit and speedwell, pretending to be a cat and encouraging
them to attack him as realistically as they could. hazel, whose talk with fiver had
somewhat clouded him, recovered as he watched them tussling over the grass and
ended by joining in himself, first as an attacker and then as the cat, staring and
quivering for all the world like the nuthanger tabby.
     "i shall be disappointed if we don't meet a cat after all this," said dandelion, as
he waited for his turn to run at a fallen beech branch from one side,

 who is familiar with cats knows that they do not care for a determined
assailant. a dog that tries to make itself pleasant to a cat may very well get
scratched for its pains. but let that same dog rush in to the attack and many a cat
will not wait to meet it. the farm cat was bewildered by the speed and fury of

bigwig's charge. it was no weakling and a good ratter, but it had the bad luck to
be up against a dedicated fighter who was spoiling for action. as it scrabbled out
of bigwig's reach, speedwell cuffed it across the face. this was the last blow
struck, for the wounded cat made off across the yard and disappeared under the
fence of the cow byre.
     bigwig was bleeding from three deep, parallel scratches on the inside of one
hind leg. the others gathered round, praising him, but he cut them short, looking
round the dark yard as he tried to get his bearings.

wellington at salamanca. "we just need time, that's all."
     the hinge had been well made and did not give way until they had put it to a
great deal more tugging and biting. dandelion grew nervous and twice gave a
false alarm. bigwig, realizing that the sentries were on the jump from watching
and waiting with nothing to do, changed places with him and sent speedwell up
to take over from blackberry. when at last dandelion and speedwell had pulled
the leather strip off the nail, bigwig came back to the hutch himself. but they did

not seem much nearer to success. whenever one of the rabbits inside stood up
and rested its forepaws on the upper part of the wire, the door pivoted lightly on
the axis of the staple and the lower hinge. but the lower hinge did not tear.
blowing through his whiskers with impatience, bigwig brought blackberry back

darkness, taking no notice of blackberry's coaxing or bigwig's orders.
at this moment a second cat -- hazel's tabby -- came round the further end of the
farmhouse and made toward them. as it passed the kennel the labrador woke
and sat up, thrusting out its head and shoulders and looking first to one side and
then the other. it saw the rabbits, ran to the length of its rope and began to bark.
     "come on!" said bigwig. "we can't stay here. up the lane, everybody, and
quickly, too." blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit ran at once, taking boxwood

and clover with them into the darkness under the barn. dandelion remained
beside haystack, begging her to move and expecting every moment to feel the
cat's claws in his back. bigwig leaped across to him.
     "dandelion," he said in his ear, "get out of it, unless you want to be killed!"
     "but the--" began dandelion.
     "do as i say!" said bigwig. the noise of barking was fearful and he himself was
close to panic. dandelion hesitated a moment long

  "why did you leave them, then?"
     "because they wouldn't move. it was bad enough before the dog started."
     "is the dog tied?" asked hazel.
     "yes, it's tied. but do you expect any rabbit to stand his ground a few feet from
an angry dog?"
     "no, of course not," replied hazel. "you've done wonders, bigwig. they were
just telling me, before you came, that you gave one of the cats such a beating that
it was afraid to come back for more. now look, do you think you and blackberry,
with speedwell here and hawkbit, can get these two rabbits back to the warren?
i'm afraid you may need most of the night. they can't go very fast and you'll have
to be patient with them. dandelion, you come with me, will you?"
     "where, hazel-rah?"
     "to fetch the other two," said hazel. "you're the fastest, so it won't be so
dangerous for you, will it? now, don't hang about, bigwig, there's a good fellow.
i'll see you tomorrow."

sake, where's hazel?"
     "the men have shot him," replied dandelion.
     they reached the other five rabbits in the straw. dandelion did not wait for
their questions.
     "they've shot hazel," he said. "they'd caught that laurel and put him back in
the hutch. then they came after us. the three of us were at the end of a blocked
ditch. hazel went out of his own accord, to distract their attention while we got
away. but we didn't know they had a gun."
     "are you sure they killed him?" said speedwell.
     "i didn't actually see him hit, but they were very close to him."
     "we'd better wait," said bigwig.
     they waited a long time. at last dandelion and bigwig went cautiously back up

the lane. they found the bottom of the ditch trampled by boots and streaked with
blood, and returned to tell the others.
     the journey back, with the three limping hutch rabbits, lasted more than two
weary hours. all were dejected and wretched. when at last they reached the foot

on to the warren. they approached the wood just at first light and a rabbit ran to
meet them through the wet grass. it was fiver. blackberry stopped and waited
beside him while the other two went on in silence.
     "fiver," he said, "there's bad news. hazel--"
     "i know," replied fiver. "i know now."
     "how do you know?" asked blackberry, startled.
     "as you came through the grass just now," said fiver, very low, "there was a
fourth rabbit behind you,

 are you?" asked dandelion. "and at the proper
time of day, for a change? it's a lovely evening, if my nose says right. we ought to
try not to be more miserable than we can help, you know."
     "just before we silflay," said bigwig, "can i tell you, holly, that i don't believe
anyone else could have brought himself and three other rabbits safely back out of
a place like that?"
     "frith meant us to get back," replied holly. "that's the real reason why we're
here."
     as he turned to follow speedwell up the run that led into the wood, he found
clover beside him. "you and your friends must find it strange to go outside and
eat grass," he said. "you'll get used to it, you know. and i can promise you that
hazel-rah was right when he told you it's a better life here than in a hutch. come
with me and i'll show you a patch of nice, short tail-grass, if bigwig hasn't had it
all while i've been away."
     holly had taken to clover. she seemed more robust and less timid than

 had himself. as for hazel, he had acquired, in everyone's eyes, a
kind of magical quality. of all the warren, dandelion was the last rabbit to fail to
do justice to a good story and he had made the most of hazel's heroic dash out of
the ditch to save his friends from the farmers. no one had even suggested that
hazel might have been reckless in going to the farm. against all odds he had got
them two does: and now he was bringing their luck back to the warren.
     just before sunrise pipkin and speedwell saw fiver coming through the wet
grass near the summit of the down. they ran out to meet him and waited with
him until hazel came up to them. hazel was limping and had evidently found the
climb a strain, but after resting and feeding for a short time he was able to run
down to the warren almost as fast as the others. the rabbits crowded round.
everyone wanted to touch him. he was sniffed and tussled with and rolled over in
the grass until he felt almost as though he were being attacked. human b

lly full of questions, but the rabbits expressed
their delight simply by proving to themselves through their senses that this was
really hazel-rah. it was all he could do to stand up to the rough play. "i wonder
what would happen if i lay down under it?" he thought. "they'd kick me out, i
dare say. they wouldn't have a crippled chief rabbit. this is a test as well as a
welcome, even though they don't know it themselves. i'll test them, the rascals,
before i'm done."
     he pushed buckthorn and speedwell off his back and broke away to the edge
of the wood. strawberry and boxwood were on the bank and he joined them and
sat washing and combing himself in the sunrise.
     "we can do with a few well-behaved fellows like you," he said to boxwood.
"look at that rough lot out there -- they nearly finished me off! what on earth do
you make of us and how are you settling down?"
     "well, of course we find it strange," said boxwood, "but we're learning.
strawberry here has been helping me a great deal

to be helped."
     late in the afternoon hazel called everyone into the honeycomb.
     "i've been thinking things over," he said. "i know you must all have been really
disappointed not to have got rid of me at nuthanger farm the other day, so i've
decided to go a bit further next time."
     "where?" asked bluebell.
     "to efrafa," replied hazel, "if i can get anyone to come with me: and we shall
bring back as many does as the warren needs."
     there were murmurs of astonishment, and then speedwell asked, "how?"
     "blackberry and i have got a plan," said hazel, "but i'm not going to explain it
now, for this reason. you all know that this is going to be a dangerous business. if
any of you get caught and taken into efrafa, they'll make you talk, all right. but
those who don't know a plan can't give it away. i'll explain it later on, at the
proper time."
     "are you going to need many rabbits, hazel-rah?" asked dandelion. "from all i
hear, the whole lot of us wouldn't be enough to fight

ide pasture fields, sloping gently downhill and divided
not by hedges but by broad, low banks, each as wide as a lane and overgrown with
elder, dogwood and spindle. it was true rabbit country, reassuring after the belt
and the tangled, goose-grassed combe; and when they had covered a good
distance over the turf -- halting continually to listen and sniff and running, now
one and now another, from each piece of cover to the next -- hazel felt safe in
giving them a rest. as soon as he had sent out speedwell and hawkbit as sentries,
he led bigwig to one side.
     "i'm angry with you," he said. "you're the one rabbit we're not going to be able
to do without and you have to go and run a silly risk like that. it wasn't necessary
and it wasn't even clever. what were you up to?"
     "i'm afraid i just lost my head, hazel," replied bigwig. "i've been strung up all
day, thinking about this business at efrafa -- got me really on edge. when i feel
like that i have to do something -- you know, fight or run

his long, pale gray wings.

     "they're tired out, kehaar. they've got to have a rest."
     "ees not to rest 'ere. ees rabbits come."
     "yes, but not just yet. we can--"
     "ya, ya, ees coming for find you! ees close!"
     "oh, curse these confounded patrols!" cried hazel. "come on, all of you, get
down the field into that wood! yes, you, too, speedwell, unless you want to have
your ears chewed off in efrafa. come on, move!"
     they tottered over the pasture to the woodland beyond and lay completely
exhausted on flat, bare ground under fir trees. hazel and fiver consulted kehaar
again.
     "it's no good expecting them to go any further, kehaar," said hazel. "they've
been going all night, you know. we'll have to sleep here today. did you actually
see a patrol?"
     "ya, ya, come all along by udder side iron road. yoost in time you go."

 us to do?" it was silver.
     "where's hazel?" he said.
     "waiting at the boat. i say, you're wounded! what--"
     "then get these does down there," said bigwig.
     all was confusion. in ones and twos the does, utterly bemused and scarcely
able to move or to understand what was said to them, were urged into getting up
and stumbling their way down the field. other rabbits began to appear through
the rain: acorn, clearly frightened, but determined not to run; dandelion
encouraging pipkin; speedwell and hawkbit making toward kehaar -- the only
creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made them understand that they were to help to get the
does away.
     "go back to blackberry, go back to blackberry," silver kept repeating. "i left
three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then bluebell, then fiver -- he's quite near the river."
     "and there is blackberry," sai

om that ditch!"
     "go back to bluebell! go back to bluebell!" repeated silver, running from side
to side.
     they found bluebell by the hedge at the bottom of the field. he was white-eyed
and ready to bolt.
     "silver," he said, "i saw a bunch of rabbits -- strangers, efrafans, i suppose --
come out of the ditch over there and slip across into the water meadow. they're
behind us now. one of them was the biggest rabbit i've ever seen."
     "then don't stay here," said silver. "there goes speedwell. and who's that?

acorn and two does with him. that's everyone. come on, quick as you can."
     it was only a short distance now to the river, but among the sodden patches of
rushes, the bushes and sedge and deep puddles, they found it next to impossible
to tell their direction. expecting to be attacked at any moment, they scuttered and
floundered through the undergrowth, finding here a doe and there one of their
own rabbits and forcing them on. without kehaar they would certainly have lost

seemed to be
their only good fortune. the rain was still falling. already so wet that they no
longer felt it, they were nevertheless shivering with cold and weighted with their
drenched fur. the punt was holding over half an inch of rainwater. there was one
small, slatted floorboard and this was floating. some of the rabbits, in the first
confusion of boarding the punt, had found themselves in this water, but now all
had got clear of it -- most either to bows or stern, though thethuthinnang and
speedwell were hunched on the narrow thwart, amidships. in addition to their
discomfort, they were exposed and helpless. finally, there was no way of
controlling the punt and they did not know where they were going. but these last
were troubles beyond the understanding of everyone but hazel, fiver and
blackberry.

courage which had brought him from efrafa to the river had gone and his

he water. out in the
river, a few feet away, the punt lay against the weedy piers.
     "silver!" said hazel. "fiver! come on, get them into the water. it's all right
below the bridge. get the does in first, if you can. there's no time to lose. the
men may come back."
     it was no easy matter to rouse the torpid, bewildered does and make them
understand what they had to do. silver went from one to another. dandelion, as
soon as he saw hazel on the bank, went at once to the bow and plunged in.
speedwell followed, but as fiver was about to go silver stopped him.
     "if all our bucks go, hazel," he said, "the does will be left alone and i don't
think they'll manage it."
     "they'll obey thlayli, sir," said blackavar, before hazel could reply. "i think
he's the one to get them started."
     bigwig was still lying in the bilgewater, in the place he had taken up when they
came to the first bridge. he seemed to be asleep, but when silver nuzzled him he
raised his head and looked about in a daze

ined a tremendous respect -- to see that he did
not overreach himself in his warm-hearted, rather candid zeal.
     after two or three days of slow, careful journeying, with many halts in cover,
they found themselves, late one afternoon, once more in sight of caesar's belt,
but further west than before, close to a little copse at the top of some rising
ground. everyone was tired and when they had fed -- "evening silflay every day,
just as you promised," said hyzenthlay to bigwig -- bluebell and speedwell
suggested that it might be worthwhile to dig some scrapes in the light soil under
the trees and live there for a day or two. hazel felt willing enough, but fiver
needed persuasion.
     "i know we can do with a rest, but somehow i don't altogether like it, hazel-
rah," he said. "i suppose i've got to try to think why?"
     "not on my account," answered hazel. "but i doubt you'll shift the others this
time. one or two of these does are 'ready for mudder,' as kehaar would say, and

     as he came to the end of his story, dandelion remembered that he was
supposed to be relieving acorn as sentry. the post was a little way away, near the
eastern corner of the wood, and hazel -- who wanted to see how boxwood and
speedwell were getting on with a hole they were digging -- went with dandelion
along the foot of the bank. he was just going down the new hole when he noticed
that some small creature was pattering about in the grass. it was the mouse that
he had saved from the kestrel. pleased to see that he was still safe and sound,
hazel turned back to have a word with him. the mouse recognized him and sat
up, washing his face with his front paws and chattering effusively.
     "is a good a days, a hot a days. you lik

"and i wish i knew more. can you and blackavar run over that way -- say,
as far as the top of the combe -- and find out what's going on?"
     "yes, of course, hazel-rah," said holly. "if there really are some other rabbits
there, we'd better bring them back with us, hadn't we? we could do with a few
more."
     "it depends who they are," said hazel. "that's what i want to find out. go at
once, holly, will you? somehow it worries me not to know."
     holly and blackavar had hardly set off when speedwell appeared above
ground. he had an excited, triumphant look which attracted everyone's attention
immediately. he squatted in front of hazel and looked round him in silence, to
make sure of his effect.
     "you've finished the hole?" asked hazel.
     "never mind the hole," answered speedwell. "i didn't come up to say that.

44.     a message from el-ahrairah

     the enforced passivity of their defence, the interminable waiting, became
insupportable. day and night they heard the muffled thud of the picks above and
dreamt of the collapse of the grotto and of every ghastly eventuality. they were
subject to "castle-mentality" in its most extreme form.

     "they've stopped digging, hazel-rah," said speedwell. "as far as i can tell,
there's no one in the hole."
     in the close darkness of the honeycomb, hazel pushed past three or four of his
rabbits crouching among the tree roots and reached the higher shelf where
speedwell lay listening for sounds from above. the efrafans had reached the
hanger at early twilight and at once begun a search along the banks and among
the trees to find out how big the warren was and where its holes were. they had
been surprised to find so many holes in such a small a

but what else was there for any of them to do? at least bigwig's preparations
would keep the others busy and perhaps do something to dispel the silent fear
that filled all the warren.
     "you're quite right, bigwig," he said. "let's prepare a little reception. will you
tell silver and the others what you want and get them started?"
     as bigwig began to explain his plan to silver and holly, hazel sent speedwell
to the north end of the honeycomb to listen to the digging and keep reporting
what he could make out about its progress. as far as he could see, it would make
little difference whether the roof-fall came there or in the center, but at least he
ought to try to show the others that he was keeping his wits about him.
     "we can't break these walls down to stop the run between, bigwig," said holly.
"they hold the roof up at this end, you know."
     "i know that," answered bigwig. "we'll dig into

stop the whole thing right up."
     since he had come out of efrafa, bigwig's standing was very high. seeing him
in good heart, the others set aside their fear as best they could and did as he told
them, enlarging the burrows beyond the south end of the honeycomb and piling
up the soft earth in the entry runs until what had been a colonnade began to
become a solid wall. it was during a pause in this work that speedwell reported
that the digging above the north end had stopped. hazel went and crouched
beside him, listening for some time. there was nothing to be heard. he went back
to where buckthorn sat guarding the foot of the single open run -- kehaar's run,
as it was called.
     "you know what's happened?" he said. "they've realized they're all among the
beech roots up there, so they've chucked it. they'll be going harder at the other
end now."
     "i suppose so, hazel-rah," replied buckthorn. after a lit

     "then you can start doing something useful," said woundwort. "get that root

     the digging continued, as the first streaks of light began to come into the east.

          -<*>-

     the great field at the foot of the escarpment had been reaped, but the straw
had not yet been burned and lay in long pale rows upon the darker stubble,
tenting over the bristling stalks and the weeds of harvest -- knotgrass and
pimpernel, fluellen and speedwell, heartsease and persicary -- colorless and still
in the old moonlight. between the lines of straw the expanse of stubble was as
open as the down.
     "now," said hazel, as they came out from the belt of hawthorn and dogwood
where the pylon stood, "are you both sure you understand what we're going to
do?"
     "it's a tall order, isn't it, hazel-rah?" answered dandelion. "but we've got to try
it, that's certain. there's nothing else that'll save the warren now."
     "come on, then," said hazel
