own'd;
  the lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.
  what first aeneas this place beheld,
  reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd.
  for while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd
  his wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd,
  admir'd the fortune of the rising town,
  the striving artists, and their arts' renown;
  he saw, in order painted on the wall,
  whatever did unhappy troy befall:
  the wars that fame around the world had blown,
  all to the life, and ev'ry leader known.
  there agamemnon, priam here, he spies,
  and fierce achilles, who both kings defies.
  he stopp'd, and weeping said: "o friend! ev'n here
  the monuments of trojan woes appear!
  our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands:
  see there, where old unhappy priam stands!
  ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame,
  and trojan griefs the tyrians' pity claim."
  he said (his tears a ready passage find),
  devouring what he saw so well design'd,
  and with an empty picture fed his mind:
  for there he saw the

  of trojan chiefs he view'd a num'rous train,
  all much lamented, all in battle slain;
  glaucus and medon, high above the rest,
  antenor's sons, and ceres' sacred priest.
  and proud idaeus, priam's charioteer,
  who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear.
  the gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend
  and with unwearied eyes behold their friend;
  delight to hover near, and long to know
  what bus'ness brought him to the realms below.
  but argive chiefs, and agamemnon's train,
  when his refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady plain,
  fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear,
  as when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear
  drove headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed rear.
  they rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes;
  but the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats.

  here priam's son, deiphobus, he found,
  whose face and limbs were one continued wound:
  dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears,
  spoil'd of his nose, and

s come to close the rear,
  mix'd with the natives born of latine blood,
  whom allia washes with her fatal flood.
  not thicker billows beat the libyan main,
  when pale orion sets in wintry rain;
  nor thicker harvests on rich hermus rise,
  or lycian fields, when phoebus burns the skies,
  than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around;
  their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground.

  high in his chariot then halesus came,
  a foe by birth to troy's unhappy name:
  from agamemnon born- to turnus' aid
  a thousand men the youthful hero led,
  who till the massic soil, for wine renown'd,
  and fierce auruncans from their hilly ground,
  and those who live by sidicinian shores,
  and where with shoaly fords vulturnus roars,
  cales' and osca's old inhabitants,
  and rough saticulans, inur'd to wants:
  light demi-lances from afar they throw,
  fasten'd with leathern thongs, to gall the foe.
  short crooked swords in closer fight they wear;
  and on their warding arm light
