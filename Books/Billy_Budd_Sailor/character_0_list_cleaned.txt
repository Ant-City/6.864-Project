[CHARACTER] - 
                	discovered
on a doorstep as an infant, [CHARACTER] is a fine physical specimen
at age twenty-one, renowned for his good looks and gentle, innocent
ways. upon taking up as a young seaman in the service of his majesty
the king of england, billy grows into the near-perfect image of
what melville calls the "handsome sailor," an ideal specimen who
inspires love and admiration in all his fellows. while working on
board the merchant ship rights-of-man, billy is
impressed into naval duty as a foretopman (a sailor who sits atop
the foremast or above) on board the warship h.m.s. bellipotent. although
much younger than most of the bellipotent's crewmen,
the cheerful, innocent young man quickly gains back the popularity
he had previously enjoyed, earning the nickname "baby budd" in the
process. he has several shortcomings, however, including an inability
to perceive ill will in other people. he also has an unpredictable
tendency to stutter, and at certain crucial moments he is rendered
completely speechless.
