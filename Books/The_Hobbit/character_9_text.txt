jrr tolkien -- the hobbit 
 
in this reprint several minor inaccuracies, most of them noted by readers, have been 
corrected. for example, the text on pages 32 and 62 now corresponds exactly with the 
runes on thror's map. more important is the matter of "chapter five". there the true 
story of the ending of the riddle game, as it was eventually revealed (under pressure) 
by bilbo to gandalf, is now given according to the red book, in place of the version 
bilbo first gave to his friends, and actually set down in his diary. this departure from 
truth on the part of a most honest hobbit was a portent of great significance. it does not, 
however, concern the present story, and those who in this edition make

their first 
acquaintance with hobbit-lore need not troupe about it. its explanation lies in the history 
of the ring, as it was set out in the chronicles of **the red book of westmarch**, and is 
now told in **the lord of the rings.** 
a final note may be added, on a point raised by several students of the lore of the 
period. on thror's map is written here of old was thrain king under the mountain; yet 
thrain was the son of thror, the last king under the mountain before the coming of the 
dragon. the map, however, is not in error. 
names are often repeated in dynasties, and the genealogies show that a distant 
ancestor of thror was referred to, thrain i, a fugitive from moria, who first discovered the 
lonely mountain, erebor, and ruled there for a while, before his people moved on to the 
remoter mountains of the north.

i have chosen mr. baggins and that ought to !6te enough for all of you. if i say he is a 
burglar, a burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. there is a lot more in him than 
you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. you may (possibly) all live 
to thank me yet. now bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have little light on this!" 
on the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece 
of parchment rather like a map. 
"this was made by thror, your grandfather, thorin, he said in answer to the dwarves' 
excited questions. "it is a plan of the mountain." 
"i don't see that this will help us much," said thorin disappointedly after a glance. "i 
remember the mountain well enough and the lands about it. 
and i know where mirkwood is, and the withered heath where the great dragons bred." 
"there is a dragon marked in red on the mountain, said balin, "but it will be easy enough 
to find him without that, if ever we arrive there."

ain and clear," said he obstinately, putting on his 
business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him), and 
doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to gandalf's 
recommendation. "also i should like to know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time 
required and remuneration, and so forth"-by which he meant: "what am i going to get 
out of it? and am i going to come back alive?" 
"o very well," said thorin. "long ago in my grandfather thror's time our family was 
driven out of the far north, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this 
mountain on the map. it had been discovered by my far ancestor, thrain the old, but 
now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls and greater workshops -
and in addition i believe they found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too. 
anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was king under the 
mountain again and treated with great reverence

horin stroked the gold chain round his 
neck-"we still mean to get it back, and to bring our curses home to smaugif we can. 
"i have often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's escape. i see now they 
must have had a private side-door which only they knew about. but apparently they 
made a map, and i should like to know how gandalf got hold of it, and why it did not 
come down to me, the rightful heir." 
"i did not 'get hold of it,' i was given it," said the wizard. 
"your grandfather thror was killed, you remember, in the mines of moria by azog the 
goblin -" 
"curse his name, yes," said thorin. 
"and thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of april, a hundred years ago last 
thursday, and has never been seen by you since-" 

"true, true," said thorin. 
"well, your father gave me this to give to you; and if i have chosen my own time and way 
of handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the trouble i had to find you. 
your father could not remember his own na

ndalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently thorin and dori came round the 
house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them. 
"one or three you meant, i see!" said beorn. "but these aren't hobbits, they are 
dwarves!" 
"thorin oakenshield, at your service! dori at your service!" said the two 
dwarves bowing again. 
"i don't need your service, thank you," said beorn, "but i expect you need mine. i am not 
over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are thorin (son of thrain, son of thror, i 
believe), and that your companion is respectable, and that you are enemies of goblins 
and are not up to any mischief in my lands-what are you up to, by the way?" 
"they are on their way to visit the land of their fathers, away east beyond mirkwood," put 
in gandalf, "and it is entirely an accident that we are in your lands at all. we were 
crossing by the high pass that should have brought us to the road that lies to the south 
of your country, when we were attacked by the evil goblins-as

days of old, when dale in the north was rich and prosperous, they had been wealthy and 
powerful, and there had been fleets of boats on the waters, and some were filled with 
gold and some with warriors in armour, and there had been wars and deeds which were 
now only a legend. the rotting piles of a greater town could still be seen along the 
shores when the waters sank in a drought. 
but men remembered little of all that, though some still sang old songs of the dwarf-
kings of the mountain, thror and thrain of the race of durin, and of the coming of the 
dragon, and the fall of the lords of dale. some sang too that thror and thrain would 
come back one day and gold would flow in rivers through the mountain-gates, and all 
that land would be filled with new song and new laughter. but this pleasant legend did 
not much affect their daily business. 
as soon as the raft of barrels came in sight boats rowed out from the piles of the town, 
and voices hailed the raft-steerers. then ropes were

who said that they had seen him flying in the sky in their young days. that being so it is 
not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing by a fire in their hut, and did 
not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the four scouts. 
their astonishment was enormous when thorin oakenshield stepped in through the 
door. 
"who are you and what do you want?" they shouted leaping to their feet and gipping for 
weapons. 
"thorin son of thrain son of thror king under the mountain!" said the dwarf in a loud 
voice, and he looked it, in spite of his torn clothes and draggled hood. the gold gleamed 
on his neck and waist: his eyes were dark and deep. "i have come back. i wish to see 
the master of your town!" 
then there was tremendous excitement. some of the more foolish ran out of the hut as if 
they expected the mountain to go golden in the night and all the waters of the lake to 
turn yellow right away. the captain of the guard came forward.

e led them over the 
bridge through the gates and into the market-place of the town. 
this was a wide circle of quiet water surrounded by the tall piles on which were built the 
greater houses, and by long wooden quays with many steps and ladders going down to 
the surface of the lake. from one great hall shone many lights and there came the 

sound of many voices. they passed its doors and stood blinking in the light looking at 
long tables filled with folk. 
"i am thorin son of thrain son of thror king under the mountain! i return!" cried thorin 
in a loud voice from the door, before the captain could say anything. all leaped to their 
feet. the master of the town sprang from his great chair. but none rose in greater 
surprise than the raft-men of the elves who were sitting at the lower end of the hall. 
pressing forward before the master's table they cried: 
"these are prisoners of our king that have escaped, wandering vagabond dwarves that 
could not give any good account of themselves

much of old songs, giving his mind to .trade and tolls, to cargoes and gold, to which habit 
he owed his position. others were of different mind, however, and quickly the matter was 
settled without him. the news had spread from the doors of the hall like fire through all 
the town. 
people were shouting inside the hall and outside it. the quays were thronged with 
hurrying feet. some began to sing snatches of old songs concerning the return of the 
king under the mountain; that it was thror's grandson not thror himself that had come 
back did not bother them at all. others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over 
the lake. 
 
"the king beneath the mountains, 
the king of carven stone, 
the lord of silver fountains 
shall come into his own! 
his crown shall be upholden, 
his harp shall be restrung, 
his halls shall echo golden 
to songs of yore re-sung. 
the woods shall wave on mountains 
and grass beneath the sun; 
his wealth shall flow in fountains 
and the rivers golde

 and be turned out. 
he was wrong. thorin, of course, was really the grandson of the king under the 
mountain, and there is no knowing what a dwarf will not dare and do for revenge or the 
recovery of his own. but the master was not sorry at all to let them go. they were 

expensive to keep, and their arrival had turned things into a long holiday in which 
business was at a standstill. 
"let them go and bother smaug, and see how he welcomes them!" he thought. 
"certainly, o thorin thrain's son thror's son!" was what he said. "you must claim your 
own. the hour is at hand, spoken of old. what help we can offer shall be yours, and we 
trust to your gratitude when your kingdom is regained." 
so one day, although autumn was now getting far on, and winds were cold, and leaves 
were falling fast, three large boats left lake-town, laden with rowers, dwarves, mr. 
baggins, and many provisions. horses and ponies had been sent round by circuitous 
paths to meet them at their appointed landing-place.

ns, as bilbo felt inclined to 
point out. then as is the nature of folk that are thoroughly perplexed, they began to 
grumble at the hobbit, blaming him for what had at first so pleased them: for bringing 
away a cup and stirring up smaug's wrath so soon. 
"what else do you suppose a burglar is to do?" asked bilbo angrily. "i was not engaged 
to kill dragons, that is warrior's work, but to steal treasure. i made the best beginning i 
could. did you expect me to trot back with the whole hoard of thror on my back? if there 
is any grumbling to be done, i think i might have a say. you ought to have brought five 
hundred burglars not one. i am sure it reflects great credit on your grandfather, but you 
cannot pretend that you ever made the vast extent of his wealth clear to me. i should 
want hundreds of years to bring it all up, if i was fifty times as big, and smaug as tame 
as a rabbit." 
after that of course the dwarves begged his pardon. 
"what then do you propose we should do, mr. baggins

 time comes. believe me or not as you 
like!" 
from that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that thorin and balin 
remembered. they wondered if they were still lying there unharmed in the hall below: 
the spears that were made for the armies of the great king bladorthin (long since dead), 
each had a thrice-forged head and their shafts were inlaid with cunning gold, but they 
were never delivered or paid for; shields made for warriors long dead; the great golden 
cup of thror, two-handed, hammered and carven with birds and flowers whose eyes and 
petals were of jewels; coats of mail gilded and silvered and impenetrable; the necklace 
of girion, lord of dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as grass, which he gave 
for the arming of his eldest son in a coat of dwarflinked rings the like of which had never 
been made before, for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple 
steel. but fairest of all was the great white gem, which the dwarves h

at fled from the 
approach of their torches fluttering in the draughts. the steps were not made, all the 
same, for hobbit-legs, and bilbo was just feeling that he could go on no longer, when 
suddenly the roof sprang high and far beyond the reach of their torch-light. a white 
glimmer could be seen coming through some opening far above, and the air smelt 
sweeter. before them light came dimly through great doors, that hung twisted on their 
hinges and half burnt. 
"this is the great chamber of thror," said thorin; "the hall of feasting and of council. not 
far off now is the front gate." 
they passed through the ruined chamber. tables were rotting there; chairs and benches 
were lying there overturned, charred and decaying. skulls and bones were upon the 
floor among flagons and bowls and broken drinking-horns and dust. as they came 
through yet more doors at the further end, a sound of water fell upon their ears, and the 
grey light grew suddenly more full. 
"there is the birth of the run

startled ears were lifted. 
even before the elvenking rode forth the news had passed west right to the pinewoods 
of the misty mountains; beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at 
council in their caves. 
"that will be the last we shall hear of thorin oakenshield, i fear," said the king. "he 
would have done better to have remained my guest. it is an ill wind, all the same," he 
added, "that blows no one any good." for he too had not forgotten the legend of the 
wealth of thror. so it was that bard's messengers found him now marching with many 
spearmen and bowmen; and crows were gathered thick, above him, for they thought that 
war was awakening again, such as had not been in those parts for a long age. but the 
king, when he received the prayers of bard, had pity, for he was the lord of a good and 
kindly people; so turning his march, which had at first been direct towards the mountain, 
he hastened now down the river to the long lake. he had not boats or rafts enou

 said bilbo (as a matter of fact, he could make nothing of it at all); "but the 
old fellow seems .very excited." 
"i only wish he was a raven!" said balin. 
"i thought you did not like them! you seemed very shy of them, when we came this way 
before." 
"those were crows! and nasty suspicious-looking creatures at that, and rude as well. 
you must have heard the ugly names they were calling after us. 
but the ravens are different. there used to be great friendship between them and the 
people of thror; and they often brought us secret news, and were rewarded with such 
bright things as they coveted to hide in their dwellings. 
"they live many a year, and their memories are long, and they hand on their wisdom to 
their children. i knew many among the ravens of the rocks when i was a dwarf- lad. this 
very height was once named ravenhill, because there was a wise and famous pair, old 
care and his wife, that lived here above the guard-chamber. but i don't suppose that any

back from now at the rising of the moon." 
it was some time before thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and listen to the 
raven's news. at length when he had told all the tale of the battle he went on: 
"so much for joy, thorin oakenshield. you may go back to your halls in safety; all the 
treasure is yours-for the moment. but many are gathering hither beside the birds. the 
news of the death of the guardian has already gone far and wide, and the legend of the 
wealth of thror has not lost in the telling during many years; many are eager for a share 
of the spoil. already a host of the elves is on the way, and carrion birds are with them 
hoping for battle and slaughter. by the lake men murmur that their sorrows are due to 
the dwarves; for they are homeless and many have died, and smaug has destroyed 
their town. they too think to find amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or 
dead. 
"your own wisdom must decide your course, but thirteen is small remnant
