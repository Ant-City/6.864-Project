   yorke. then thus:
edward the third, my lords, had seuen sonnes:
the first, edward the black-prince, prince of wales;
the second, william of hatfield; and the third,
lionel, duke of clarence; next to whom,
was iohn of gaunt, the duke of lancaster;
the fift, was edmond langley, duke of yorke;
the sixt, was thomas of woodstock, duke of gloster;
william of windsor was the seuenth, and last.
edward the black-prince dyed before his father,
and left behinde him richard, his onely sonne,
who after edward the third's death, raign'd as king,
till henry bullingbrooke, duke of lancaster,
the eldest sonne and heire of iohn of gaunt,
crown'd by the name of henry the fourth,
seiz'd on the realme, depos'd the rightfull king,
sent his poore queene to france, from whence she came,
and him to pumfret; where, as all you know,
harmelesse richard was murthered traiterously
