edmund mortimer, called the earl of march  - 
the welsh rebel owain glyndwr's
son-in-law. mortimer is a conflation of two separate historical
figures: mortimer and the earl of march. for shakespeare's purposes,
mortimer matters because he had a strong claim to the throne of england
before king henry overthrew the previous king, richard ii.
