                a 33-year-old,
unmarried expatriate who lives in paris and works as an informal
"guide" to europe for american visitors. miss gostrey takes an immediate liking
to strether when they first meet in england. separate from the woollett
society, she offers strether keen and objective analysis of situations
and people, and strether relies on her wise counsel. although she
is young and sprightly, she is more world-weary, more socially skeptical,
and warier of people's motives than strether. she knows madame de
vionnet from a school they attended as young women but steadfastly
avoids reacquainting herself with the other woman. at the end of
the novel, she all but declares her love for strether, who rejects
her in favor of returning to the united states.
