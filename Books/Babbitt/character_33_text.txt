"kind of a no-account, i guess you mean!"

"who's telling this, smarty? and he said he knew my papa's papa's folks
in poland and they had a dandy big house. right on a lake!" doubtfully,
"maybe you don't believe it?"

"sure. no. really. sure i do. why not? don't think i'm kidding you,
honey, but every time i've noticed you i've said to myself, 'that kid
has blue blood in her veins!'"

"did you, honest?"

"honest i did. well, well, come on--now we're friends--what's the
darling little name?"

"ida putiak. it ain't so much-a-much of a name. i always say to ma, i
say, 'ma, why didn't you name me doloress or something with some class
to it?'"

"well, now, i think it's a scrumptious name. ida!"

"i bet i know your name!"

"well, now, not necessarily. of course--oh, it isn't so specially well
known."

"aren't you mr. sondheim that travels for the krackajack kitchen kutlery
ko.?"

"i am not! i'm mr. babbitt, the real-estate broker!"

"oh, excuse me! oh, of course. you mean here in zenith."

"yep." wi

we say nighty-night. now give me a cigarette."

he was solicitous about lighting her cigarette and inquiring as to
her comfort. then he sat as far from her as possible. he was cold with
failure. no one could have told babbitt that he was a fool with more
vigor, precision, and intelligence than he himself displayed. he
reflected that from the standpoint of the rev. dr. john jennison drew
he was a wicked man, and from the standpoint of miss ida putiak, an old
bore who had to be endured as the penalty attached to eating a large
dinner.

"dearie, you aren't going to go and get peevish, are you?"

she spoke pertly. he wanted to spank her. he brooded, "i don't have to
take anything off this gutter-pup! darn immigrant! well, let's get it
over as quick as we can, and sneak home and kick ourselves for the rest
of the night."

he snorted, "huh? me peevish? why, you baby, why should i be peevish?
now, listen, ida; listen to uncle george. i want to pu

cheerfully as he listened to the sparrows, then to
remember that everything was wrong; that he was determined to go astray,
and not in the least enjoying the process. why, he wondered, should he
be in rebellion? what was it all about? "why not be sensible; stop all
this idiotic running around, and enjoy himself with his family,
his business, the fellows at the club?" what was he getting out of
rebellion? misery and shame--the shame of being treated as an offensive
small boy by a ragamuffin like ida putiak! and yet--always he came back
to "and yet." whatever the misery, he could not regain contentment with
a world which, once doubted, became absurd.

only, he assured himself, he was "through with this chasing after
girls."

by noontime he was not so sure even of that. if in miss mcgoun, louetta
swanson, and ida he had failed to find the lady kind and lovely, it did
not prove that she did not exist. he was hunted by the ancient thought
that somewhere must exist the not impossible she who would und

the persistent
teasing at the roughnecks' table. he was wondering what zilla riesling
was doing now. he was wondering whether, after the summer's maturity
of being a garageman, ted would "get busy" in the university. he was
thinking of his wife. "if she would only--if she wouldn't be so darn
satisfied with just settling down--no! i won't! i won't go back! i'll
be fifty in three years. sixty in thirteen years. i'm going to have some
fun before it's too late. i don't care! i will!"

he thought of ida putiak, of louetta swanson, of that nice widow--what
was her name?--tanis judique?--the one for whom he'd found the flat. he
was enmeshed in imaginary conversations. then:

"gee, i can't seem to get away from thinking about folks!"

thus it came to him merely to run away was folly, because he could never
run away from himself.

that moment he started for zenith. in his journey there was no
appearance of flight, but he was fleeing, and four days afterward he was
on the zenith train. he knew that he was

ural. they agreed about everything. they even became bold. they
hinted that these modern young girls, well, honestly, their short skirts
were short. they were proud to find that they were not shocked by such
frank speaking. tanis ventured, "i know you'll understand--i mean--i
don't quite know how to say it, but i do think that girls who pretend
they're bad by the way they dress really never go any farther. they give
away the fact that they haven't the instincts of a womanly woman."

remembering ida putiak, the manicure girl, and how ill she had used him,
babbitt agreed with enthusiasm; remembering how ill all the world had
used him, he told of paul riesling, of zilla, of seneca doane, of the
strike:

"see how it was? course i was as anxious to have those beggars licked to
a standstill as anybody else, but gosh, no reason for not seeing their
side. for a fellow's own sake, he's got to be broad-minded and liberal,
don't you think so?"

"oh, i do!" sitting on the hard little couch, she clasped her
