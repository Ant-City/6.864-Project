[CHARACTER] 
[CHARACTER] plays perhaps the most instrumental role in the
changes that occur in steppenwolf. clues to his
importance are present from his first mention in the narrative.
hermine foreshadows [CHARACTER]'s importance in her extreme admiration
for him and her claim that he can play all instruments and speak
all the languages of the world. the fact that [CHARACTER] is the character
most associated with music provides a persistent cue to his significance.
indeed, he is a genius bandleader and therefore in charge of defining
the rhythms to which all others must tune their behavior. yet, despite
harry's efforts to discover [CHARACTER]'s value, we have little to go
on until the very close of the novel, when [CHARACTER] introduces harry
to the magic theater.
	in the magic theater, the seemingly simple-minded [CHARACTER] achieves
his apotheosis, revealing himself to be the most enlightened figure
in the story. in fact, an earlier criticism of [CHARACTER]--that he seemed
unproblematic as a child--turns out to be a marker of his profound
wisdom. [CHARACTER]'s wisdom does not require the stifling books and theories
under which harry has buried half his life. rather, [CHARACTER]'s wisdom
stems from lived experience, and from a deep consideration of the
world that exists within one's own soul. as [CHARACTER] explains to harry,
the important thing is to play music and play it well--not to waste
time talking or theorizing about it. [CHARACTER]'s ability to shift effortlessly
between his two saxophones as he plays symbolizes the ideal integration
of the spiritual and the physical to which harry aspires.
