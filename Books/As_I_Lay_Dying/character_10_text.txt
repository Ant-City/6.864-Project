the difference. wouldn't mind, anyway. i have seen him spend a hour trimming out 

a wedge like it was glass he was working, when, he could have reached around and 

picked tip a dozen sticks and drove them into the joint and made it do. 



when we finished i go back to the front. the men have gone a little piece 
from the house, sitting on the ends of the boards and on the sawhorses where we 
made it last night, some sitting and some squatting, whitfield aint come yet. 
they look up at me, their eyes asking. 
"it's about," i say. "he's ready to nail." 

while they are getting up anse comes to file clod and looks at us and we 
return to the porch. we scrape our shoes again, careful, waiting for one another 
to go in first, milling a little at the door. anse stands inside the door, 
dignified, composed. he waves us in and leads the way into the room.

ery joint a scrubbed with the plane, tight as a drum 
and neat as a sewing basket, and they had laid her in it head to foot so it 
wouldn't crush her dress. it was her wedding dress and it had a flare-out 
bottom, and they had laid her head to foot in it so the dress could spread out, 
and they had made her a veil out of a mosquito bar so the auger holes in her 
face wouldn't show. 

when we are going out, whitfield comes. he is wet and muddy to the waist, 

coming in. "the lord comfort this house," he says. "i was late because the 

bridge has gone. i went down to the old ford and swum my horse over, the lord 

protecting me. his grace be upon this house." 

we go back to the trestles and plank-ends and sit or squat. 

"i knowed it would go," armstid says. 

"it's been there a long time, that ere bridge," quick says. 

"the lord has kept it there, yon mean," uncle billy says. "i dont know ere

beginning to swell as they take hold, and we rise and move toward the door, 
taking off our hats and throwing our chews away. we do not go in. we stop at the 
steps, clumped, holding our hats between our lax hands in front or behind, 
standing with one foot advanced and our heads lowered, looking aside, down at 
our hats in our hands and at the earth or now and then at the sky and at one 
another's grave, composed face. 

the song ends; the voices quaver away with a rich and dying fall. 
whitfield begins. his voice in bigger than him. it's like they are not the same. 
it's like he is one, and his voice is one, swimming on two horses side by side 
across the ford and coming into the house, the mud-splashed one and the one that 
never even got wet, triumphant and sad. somebody in the house begins to cry. it 
sounds like her eyes and her voice were turned back inside her, listening; we 
move, shifting to the other leg, meeting one another's eye and making like they 
hadn't touched.

p, we could drive across," anse says, "we could drive 
right on across it." 

sometimes a log would get shoved over the jam and float on, rolling and 
turning, and we could watch it go on to where the ford used to be. it would slow 
up and whirl crossways and hang out of water for a minute, and you could tell by 
that that the ford used to be there. 

"but that dont show nothing," i say. it could he a bar of quicksand built 
up there." we watch the log. then the gal is looking at me again. 
"mr whitfield crossed it," she says. 

"he was a-horseback," i say. "and three days ago. its riz five foot 
since." 

"if the bridge was just up," anse says. 

the log bobs up and goes on again. there is a lot of trash and foam, and 
you can hear the water. 
"but its down," anse says. 

cash says, "a careful fellow could walk across yonder on the planks and 
logs." 

"but you couldn't tote nothing," i say. "likely time you set foot on that 
mess, it'll all go, too. what you think, darl?"

eyes of hisn that makes folks talk. i always say it aint never been what he done 
so much or said or anything so much as how he looks at you. it's like he had got 
into the inside of you, someway. like somehow you was looking at yourself and 
your doings outen his eyes. then i can feel that gal watching me like i had made 
to touch her. she says something to anse. ". . . mr whitfield . .." she says. 
"i give her my promised word in the presence of the lord," anse says. "i 
reckon it aint no need to worry." 



but still he does not start the mules. we set there above the water. 

another log bobs up over the jam and goes on; we watch it check up and swing 

slow for a minute where the ford used to be. then it goes on. 

"it might start falling tonight," i say. "you could lay over one more 

day." 

then jewel turns sideways on the horse. he has not moved until then, and

"he could go on ahead slow and sort of feel it out," i say. 

"yes," cash says, not looking at me. his face is in profile as he looks 

forward where jewel has moved on ahead. 

"he cant miss the river," i say. "he couldn't miss seeing it fifty yards 

ahead." 

cash does not look at me, his face in profile, "if i'd just suspicioned 
it, i could a come down last week and taken a sight on it." 
"the bridge was up then," i say. he does not look at me. "whitfield 
crossed it a-horseback." 

jewel looks at us again, his expression sober and alert and subdued. his 
voice is quiet. "what you want me to do?" 

"i ought to come down last week and taken a sight on it," cash says. 
"we couldn't have known," i say. "there wasn't any way for us to know." 



"i'll ride on ahead," jewel says. "you can follow where i am." he lifts 
the horse. it shrinks, bowed; he leans to it, speaking to it, lifting it forward 
almost bodily, it setting its feet down with gingerl

one day we were talking. she had never been pure religious, not even after that 
summer at the camp meeting when brother whitfield wrestled with her spirit, 
singled her out and strove with the vanity in her mortal heart, and i said to 
her many a time, "god gave you children to comfort your hard human lot and for a 
token of his own suffering and love, for in love you conceived and bore them." i 
said that because she took god's love and her duty to him too much as a matter 
of course, and such conduct is not pleasing to him. i said, "he gave us the gift 
to raise our voices in his undying praise" because i said there is

absolving you." and she said, "i know my own sin. i know that i deserve my 
punishment. i do not begrudge it." and i said, 'it is out of your vanity that 
you would judge sin and salvation in the lord's place. it is our mortal lot to 
suffer and to raise our voices in praise of him who judges the sin and offers 
the salvation through our trials and tribulations time out of mind amen. not 
even after brother whitfield, a godly man if ever one breathed god's breath,

because it is not us that can judge our sins or know what is sin in the 
lord's eyes. she has had a hard me, but so does every woman. but you'd think 
from the way she talked that she knew more about sin and salvation than the lord 
god himself, than them who have strove and labored with the sin in this human 
world. when the only sin she ever committed was being partial to jewe

i gave anse dewey dell to negative jewel. then i gave him vardaman to 

replace the child i had robbed him of. and now he has three children that are 

his and not mine. and then i could get ready to die. 

one day i was talking to cora. she prayed for me because she believed i 

was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel and pray too, because people to whom sin 

is just a matter of words, to them salvation is just words too.

when they told me she was dying, all that night i wrestled with satan, and i 
emerged victorious. i woke to the enormity of my sin; i saw the true light at 
last, and i fell on my knees and confessed to god and asked his guidance and 
received it. "rise," he said; "repair to that home in which you have put a 
living lie, among those people with whom you have outraged my word; confess your 
sin aloud. it is for them, for that deceived husband, to forgive you: not i." 
so i went. i heard that t
