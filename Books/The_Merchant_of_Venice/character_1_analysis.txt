Portia

Quick-witted, wealthy, and beautiful, Portia embodies
the virtues that are typical of Shakespeare's heroines--it is no
surprise that she emerges as the antidote to Shylock's malice. At
the beginning of the play, however, we do not see Portia's potential
for initiative and resourcefulness, as she is a near prisoner, feeling
herself absolutely bound to follow her father's dying wishes. This
opening appearance, however, proves to be a revealing introduction
to Portia, who emerges as that rarest of combinations--a free spirit
who abides rigidly by rules. Rather than ignoring the stipulations
of her father's will, she watches a stream of suitors pass her by,
happy to see these particular suitors go, but sad that she has no
choice in the matter. When Bassanio arrives, however, Portia proves
herself to be highly resourceful, begging the man she loves to stay
a while before picking a chest, and finding loopholes in the will's
provision that we never thought possible. Also, in her defeat of
Shylock Portia prevails by applying a more rigid standard than Shylock
himself, agreeing that his contract very much entitles him to his
pound of flesh, but adding that it does not allow for any loss of
blood. Anybody can break the rules, but Portia's effectiveness comes
from her ability to make the law work for her.
Portia rejects the stuffiness that rigid adherence to
the law might otherwise suggest. In her courtroom appearance, she
vigorously applies the law, but still flouts convention by appearing
disguised as a man. After depriving Bassanio of his ring, she stops
the prank before it goes to far, but still takes it far enough to
berate Bassanio and Gratiano for their callousness, and she even
insinuates that she has been unfaithful.
