sleep,” amory said calmly, resettling himself and reaching
beside the bed for a cigarette.

“sleep!”

“why not? i’ve got a class at eleven-thirty.”

“you damned gloom! of course, if you don’t want to go to the coast--”

with a bound amory was out of bed, scattering the bureau cover’s burden
on the floor. the coast... he hadn’t seen it for years, since he and his
mother were on their pilgrimage.

“who’s going?” he demanded as he wriggled into his b. v. d.’s.

“oh, dick humbird and kerry holiday and jesse ferrenby and--oh about
five or six. speed it up, kid!”

in ten minutes amory was devouring cornflakes in renwick’s, and at
nine-thirty they bowled happily out of town, headed for the sands of
deal beach.

“you see,” said kerry, “the car belongs down there. in fact, it was
stolen from asbury park by persons unknown, who deserted it in princeton
and left for the west. heartless humbird here got permission from the
city council to deliver it.”

incident into a thing of curve and contour. they all seemed to have
the spirit of it more or less, and it was a relaxation to be with them.
amory usually liked men individually, yet feared them in crowds unless
the crowd was around him. he wondered how much each one contributed to
the party, for there was somewhat of a spiritual tax levied. alec and
kerry were the life of it, but not quite the centre. somehow the quiet
humbird, and sloane, with his impatient superciliousness, were the
centre.

dick humbird had, ever since freshman year, seemed to amory a perfect
type of aristocrat. he was slender but well-built--black curly hair,
straight features, and rather a dark skin. everything he said sounded
intangibly appropriate. he possessed infinite courage, an averagely good
mind, and a sense of honor with a clear charm and _noblesse oblige_
that varied it from righteousness. he could dissipate without going to
pieces, and even his most bohemian adventures never seemed “running it
out.” people dre

cracked hollowness of her voice as she spoke:

“you princeton boys?”

“yes.”

“well, there’s one of you killed here, and two others about dead.”

“_my god!_”

“look!” she pointed and they gazed in horror. under the full light of
a roadside arc-light lay a form, face downward in a widening circle of
blood.

they sprang from the car. amory thought of the back of that head--that
hair--that hair... and then they turned the form over.

“it’s dick--dick humbird!”

“oh, christ!”

“feel his heart!”

then the insistent voice of the old crone in a sort of croaking triumph:

“he’s quite dead, all right. the car turned over. two of the men that
weren’t hurt just carried the others in, but this one’s no use.”

amory rushed into the house and the rest followed with a limp mass that
they laid on the sofa in the shoddy little front parlor. sloane, with
his shoulder punctured, was on another lounge. he was half delirious,

l at all--will had turned him away from the moving
figure in the street; it was almost instinct that called, just the pile
on pile of inherent tradition or some wild prayer from way over the
night. then something clanged like a low gong struck at a distance,
and before his eyes a face flashed over the two feet, a face pale and
distorted with a sort of infinite evil that twisted it like flame in
the wind; _but he knew, for the half instant that the gong tanged and
hummed, that it was the face of dick humbird._

minutes later he sprang to his feet, realizing dimly that there was no
more sound, and that he was alone in the graying alley. it was cold, and
he started on a steady run for the light that showed the street at the
other end.

it was late morning when he woke and found the telephone beside his bed
in the hotel tolling frantically, and remembered that he had left word
to be called at eleven. sloane was snoring heavily, his clothes in a
pile by his bed. they dre
