convince the threarah."
     "because the threarah doesn't like anything he hasn't thought of for himself,"
answered hazel. "but we can't bother with him any more now. we've got to try to
collect some more rabbits and meet again here, fu inlé. and we'll start fu inlé,
too: we can't wait longer. the danger's coming closer all the time -- whatever it is
-- and, besides, the threarah isn't going to like it if he finds out that you've been
trying to get at rabbits in the owsla, bigwig. neither is captain holly, i dare say.
they won't mind odds and ends like us clearing off, but they won't want to lose
you. if i were in your place, i'd be careful whom i picked to talk to."

     now sir, young fortinbras,
     of unimproved mettle hot and full,
     hath in the skirts of norway here and there
     sharked up a list of lawless resolutes
     for food and diet to some enterprise
     that hath a stomach in't.

wood?"
     hazel realized wearily that bigwig was probably going to be troublesome. he
was certainly no coward, but he was likely to remain steady only as long as he
could see his way clear and be sure of what to do. to him, perplexity was worse
than danger; and when he was perplexed he usually grew angry. the day before,
fiver's warning had troubled him, and he had spoken in anger to the threarah
and left the owsla. then, while he was in an uncertain mood about the idea of
leaving the warren, captain holly had appeared in capital time to be attacked and
to provide a perfect reason for their departure. now, at the sight of the river,
bigwig's assurance was leaking again and unless he, hazel, could restore it in
some way, they were likely to be in for trouble. he thought of the threarah and
his wily courtesy.
     "i don't know what we should have done without you just now, bigwig," he

said. "what was that animal? would it have killed us?"
     "a lendri," said bigwig. "i've heard about them in t

pping one of the tough stems in his teeth, shake a
shower of drops out of his fur and scutter into the alder bushes. a moment later,
between the nut trees, they saw him running off into the field.
     "i'm glad he's with us," said hazel to silver. again he thought wryly of the
threarah. "he's the fellow to find out all we need to know. oh, i say, look, he's
coming back already."
     bigwig was racing back across the field, looking more agitated than he had at
any time since the encounter with captain holly. he ran into the water almost
headlong and paddled over fast, leaving an arrowhead ripple on the calm brown
surface. he was speaking as he jerked himself out on the sandy foreshore.
     "well, hazel, if i were you i shouldn't wait until ni-frith. i should go now. in
fact, i think you'll have to."
     "why?" asked hazel.
     "there's a large dog loose in the wood."
     hazel started. "what?" he said. "how do you know?"
     "when you get into the field you can see the wood sloping down to th

as themselves: a rabbit in the last
stages of exhaustion, its back legs trailing behind its flattened rump as though
paralyzed: a rabbit that stared, white-eyed, from one side to the other, seeing
nothing, yet finding no respite from its fear, and then fell to licking wretchedly at
one ripped and bloody ear that drooped across its face: a rabbit that suddenly
cried and wailed as though entreating the thousand to come from every quarter
to rid it of a misery too terrible to be borne.
     it was captain holly of the sandleford owsla.

     *bigwig's word was hlessil, which i have rendered in various places in the story
as wanderers, scratchers, vagabonds. a hlessi is a rabbit living in the open,
without a hole. solitary bucks and unmated rabbits who are wandering do this for
quite long periods, especially in summer. bucks do not usually dig much in any
case, although they will scratch shallow shelters or make use of existing holes
where these are available. real digging is done for the most part by

. to find him under watership down at all, therefore, was astonishing
enough. but to find him in such a condition was all but incredible.
     in the first moments after they had recognized the poor creature under the
hemlock, hazel and dandelion felt completely stupefied, as though they had
come upon a squirrel underground or a stream that flowed uphill. they could not
trust their senses. the voice in the dark had proved not to be supernatural, but
the reality was frightening enough. how could captain holly be here, at the foot
of the down? and what could have reduced him -- of all rabbits -- to this state?
     hazel pulled himself together. whatever the explanation might be, the
immediate need was to take first things first. they were in open country, at night,
away from any refuge but an overgrown ditch, with a rabbit who smelled of blood,
was crying uncontrollably and looked as though he could not move. there might
very well be a stoat on his trail at this moment. if they were going to help hi

nly when the moon began to rise -- the edge of its
great disc growing brighter and brighter on the skyline below and behind them --
did he at last beg holly to hurry. as he spoke he saw, in the white light, pipkin
coming down to meet them.
     "what are you doing?" he said sternly. "i told speedwell no one was to come
down."
     "it isn't speedwell's fault," said pipkin. "you stood by me at the river, so i
thought i'd come and look for you, hazel. anyway, the holes are just here. is it
really captain holly you've found?"
     bigwig and dandelion approached.
     "i'll tell you what," said bigwig. "these two will need to rest for a good long
time. suppose pipkin here and dandelion take them to an empty burrow and stay
with them as long as they want? the rest of us had better keep away until they
feel better."
     "yes, that's best," said hazel. "i'll go up with you now."
     they ran the short distance to the thorn trees. all the other rabbits were above
ground, waiting and whispering together.

this coming? i don't know him."
     strawberry came running down from the hanger and as he joined them began
to make the same curious dancing gesture of head and forepaws which they had
first seen in the rainy meadow before they entered the great burrow. he checked
himself in some confusion and, to forestall bigwig's rebuke, spoke to hazel at
once.
     "hazel-rah," he said (holly looked startled, but said nothing), "everyone wants
to stay in the new warren tonight: and they're all hoping that captain holly will
feel able to tell them what's happened and how he came here."
     "well, naturally, we all want to know," said hazel to holly. "this is strawberry.
he joined us on our journey and we've been glad to have him. but do you think
you can manage it?"
     "i can manage it," said holly. "but i must warn you that it will strike the frost
into the heart of every rabbit that hears it."
     he himself looked so sad and dark as he spoke that no one made any reply, and
after a few moments all six ra
