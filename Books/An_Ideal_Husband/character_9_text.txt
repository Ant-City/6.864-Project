proaches_ lady basildon.]

vicomte de nanjac.  may i have the honour of taking you down to supper,
comtesse?

lady basildon.  [_coldly_.]  i never take supper, thank you, vicomte.
[_the_ vicomte _is about to retire_.  lady basildon, _seeing this_,
_rises at once and takes his arm_.]  but i will come down with you with
pleasure.

vicomte de nanjac.  i am so fond of eating!  i am very english in all my
tastes.

lady basildon.  you look quite english, vicomte, quite english.

[_they pass out_.  mr. montford, _a perfectly groomed young dandy_,
_approaches_ mrs. marchmont.]

mr. montford.  like some supper, mrs. marchmont?

mrs. marchmont.  [_languidly_.]  thank you, mr. montford, i never touch
supper.  [_rises hastily and takes his arm_.]  but i will sit beside you,
and watch you.

mr. montford.  i don’t know that i like being watched when i am eating!

mrs. marchmont.  then i will watch some one else.

mr. montford.  i don’t know that i should like that either.

mrs. marchmont.  [_severely_.]

 pray, mr. montford, do not make these
painful scenes of jealousy in public!

[_they go downstairs with the other guests_, _passing_ sir robert
chiltern _and_ mrs. cheveley, _who now enter_.]

sir robert chiltern.  and are you going to any of our country houses
before you leave england, mrs. cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  oh, no!  i can’t stand your english house-parties.  in
england people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast.  that is so
dreadful of them!  only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.  and the

on the subject.

mrs. cheveley.  thank you.  i knew we should come to an amicable
agreement.  i understood your nature from the first.  i analysed you,
though you did not adore me.  and now you can get my carriage for me, sir
robert.  i see the people coming up from supper, and englishmen always
get romantic after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.  [_exit_ sir
robert chiltern.]

[_enter guests_, lady chiltern, lady markby, lord caversham, lady
basildon, mrs. marchmont, vicomte de nanjac, mr. montford.]

lady markby.  well, dear mrs. cheveley, i hope you have enjoyed yourself.
sir robert is very entertaining, is he not?

mrs. cheveley.  most entertaining!  i have enjoyed my talk with him
immensely.

lady markby.  he has had a very interesting and brilliant career.  and he
has married a most admirable wife.  lady chiltern is a woman of the very
highest principles, i am glad to say.  i am a little too old now, myself,
to trouble about setting a good example, but i always admire people who
do.

is all.  but
how can i do it?  letters arrive for him every moment of the day.  his
secretaries open them and hand them to him.  i dare not ask the servants
to bring me his letters.  it would be impossible.  oh! why don’t you tell
me what to do?

lord goring.  pray be calm, lady chiltern, and answer the questions i am
going to put to you.  you said his secretaries open his letters.

lady chiltern.  yes.

lord goring.  who is with him to-day?  mr. trafford, isn’t it?

lady chiltern.  no.  mr. montford, i think.

lord goring.  you can trust him?

lady chiltern.  [_with a gesture of despair_.]  oh! how do i know?

lord goring.  he would do what you asked him, wouldn’t he?

lady chiltern.  i think so.

lord goring.  your letter was on pink paper.  he could recognise it
without reading it, couldn’t he?  by the colour?

lady chiltern.  i suppose so.

lord goring.  is he in the house now?

lady chiltern.  yes.

lord goring.  then i will go and see him myself, and tell him that a

gertrude?

[lord goring, _unseen by_ sir robert chiltern, _makes an imploring sign
to_ lady chiltern _to accept the situation and_ sir robert’s _error_.]

lady chiltern.  yes.

sir robert chiltern.  you trust me, gertrude?

lady chiltern.  yes.

sir robert chiltern.  ah! why did you not add you loved me?

lady chiltern.  [_taking his hand_.]  because i loved you.

[lord goring _passes into the conservatory_.]

sir robert chiltern.  [_kisses her_.]  gertrude, you don’t know what i
feel.  when montford passed me your letter across the table—he had opened
it by mistake, i suppose, without looking at the handwriting on the
envelope—and i read it—oh! i did not care what disgrace or punishment was
in store for me, i only thought you loved me still.

lady chiltern.  there is no disgrace in store for you, nor any public
shame.  mrs. cheveley has handed over to lord goring the document that
was in her possession, and he has destroyed it.

sir robert chiltern.  are you sure of this, gertrude?
