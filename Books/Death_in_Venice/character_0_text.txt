man prince, just recently crowned, knighted the creator of the "frederick" on 
his fiftieth birthday 

after several years of unrest and much trying out of different places he soon 
picked munich as his permanent hometown and there he lived in those bourgeois 
honors that in rare cases are bestowed upon the intellect. his marriage to a 
girl, the offspring of a highly educated family, had been terminated by her death. 
a daughter, already married herself, had remained. he had never had a son. 

gustav von aschenbach was not particularly tall, with dark hair, beardless. 
his head seemed curiously oversized in relation to his almost frail figure. his 
brushed-back hair, thinning at the cortex, very voluminous at the temples and 
quite gray, framed a high, furrowed and, so to say, scarred forehead. the frame of 
golden eyeglasses cut into the root of a somewhat plump yet nobly curved nose.

cheeks were narrow and furrowed, the we

a few days after that, gustav von aschenbach, feeling unwell, left the hotel des 
bains later than usual. he had struggled with certain fits of dizziness, only half 
physical, that were accompanied by strong feelings of fear and perplexity, a sense 
of hopelessness, of which it was not clear whether it pertained to the outside world 
or his own existence. in the lobby he saw a lot trunks and asked the porter who it 
was who was leaving and got as a reply an aristocratic polish name of which he 
had already been dimly aware. his decayed fe
