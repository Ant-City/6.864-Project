ivity at this hour, gossiping with a chasseur by the servants' entrance.

passing through the corridor, he heard only a single, bored voice in the once-clamorous women's room. when he turned into the bar he travelled the twenty feet of green carpet with his eyes fixed straight ahead by old habit; and then, with his foot firmly on the rail, he turned and surveyed the room, encountering only a single pair of eyes that fluttered up from a newspaper in the corner. charlie asked for the head barman, paul, who in the latter days of the bull market had come to work in his own custom-built car--disembarking, however, with due nicety at the nearest corner. but paul was at his country house today and alix giving him information.

"no, no more," charlie said, "i'm going slow these days."

alix congratulated him: "you were going pretty strong a couple of years ago."

"i'll stick to it all right," charlie assured him. "i've stuck to it for over a year and a half now."

erica?"

"i haven't been to america for months. i'm in business in prague, representing a couple of concerns there. they don't know about me down there."

alix smiled.

"remember the night of george hardt's bachelor dinner here?" said charlie. "by the way, what's become of claude fessenden?"

"no, i'm in business in prague."

"i heard that you lost a lot in the crash."

"i did," and he added grimly, "but i lost everything i wanted in the boom."

"selling short."

"something like that."
