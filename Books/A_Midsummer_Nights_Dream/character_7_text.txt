the sealing day betwixt my loue and me,
for euerlasting bond of fellowship:
vpon that day either prepare to dye,
for disobedience to your fathers will,
or else to wed demetrius as hee would,
or on dianaes altar to protest
for aie, austerity, and single life

let me haue hermiaes: do you marry him

   egeus. scornfull lysander, true, he hath my loue;
and what is mine, my loue shall render him.
and she is mine, and all my right of her,
i do estate vnto demetrius

   lys. i am my lord, as well deriu'd as he,
as well possest: my loue is more then his:
my fortunes euery way as fairely ranck'd
(if not with vantage) as demetrius:
and (which is more then all these boasts can be)
i am belou'd of beauteous hermia.
why should not i then prosecute my right?
