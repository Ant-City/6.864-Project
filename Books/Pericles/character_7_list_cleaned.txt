[CHARACTER] later pledges to take care of pericles's infant child, but his wife, dionyza, plots to kill the child. [CHARACTER] was apparently unaware of the scheme, but when he hears of it, wishes it could be undone. but soon [CHARACTER] takes the blame for what dionyza has done, and both are punished.
