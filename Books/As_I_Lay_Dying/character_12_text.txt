ay. "wherever she went, she has her reward in being 

free of anse bundren." she laid there three days in that box, waiting for darl 

and jewel to come clean back home and get a new wheel and go back to where the 

wagon was in the ditch. take my team, anse, i said. 

we'll wait for ourn, he said. she'll want it so. she was ever a 

particular woman. 

on the third day they got back and they loaded her into the wagon and 
started and it already too late. you'll have to go all the way round by 
samson's bridge. it'll take you a day to get there. then you'll be forty miles 
from jefferson. take my team, anse. 
we'll wait for ourn. she'll want it so. 

it was about a mile from the house we saw him, sitting on the edge of the 
slough. it hadn't had a fish in it never that i knowed. he looked around at us, 
his eyes round and calm, his face dirty, the pole across his knees. cora was

ng, living off of them that 
sweats. it aint the hardworking man, the farmer. sometimes i wonder why we keep 
at it. it's because there is a reward for us above, where they cant take their 
autos and such. every man will be equal there and it will be taken from them 
that have and give to them that have not by the lord. 
but it's a long wait, seems like. it's bad that a fellow must earn the 
reward of his right-doing by flouting hisself and his dead. we drove all the 
rest of the day and got to samson's at dust-dark and then that bridge was gone, 
too. they hadn't never see the river so high, and it not done raining yet there 
was old men that hadn't never see nor hear of it being so in the memory of man. 
i am the chosen of the lord, for who he loveth, so doeth he chastiseth. but i be 
durn if he dont take some curious ways to show it, seems like. 
but now i can get them teeth. that will be a comfort. it will.

was it was wind blowing over me it was like the wind came and blew me back from 
where it was i was not blowing the room and vardaman asleep and all of them 
back, under me again and going on like a piece of cool silk dragging across my 
naked legs 

it blows cool out of the pines, a sad steady sound. new hope. was 3 mi. 
was 3 mi. i believe in god i believe in god. 

"why didn't we go to new hope, pa?" vardaman says. "mr samson said we was, 
but we done passed the road." 

darl says, "look, jewel." but he is not looking at me. he is looking at 

the sky. he buzzard is as still as if he were nailed to it. 

we turn into tull's lane. we pass the barn and go on, the wheels 

whispering in the mud, passing the green rows of cotton in the wild earth, and 

vernon little across the field behind the plow. he lifts his hand as we pass and 

stands there looking after us for a long while. 

"look, jewel," darl says. jewel sits
