the men aboard the nellie - 
marlow's friends, who are with him aboard a ship
on the thames at the story's opening. they are the audience for
the central story of heart of darkness, which marlow
narrates. all have been sailors at one time or another, but all
now have important jobs ashore and have settled into middle-class,
middle-aged lives. they represent the kind of man marlow would have
likely become had he not gone to africa: well meaning and moral
but ignorant as to a large part of the world beyond england. the narrator
in particular seems to be shaken by marlow's story. he repeatedly
comments on its obscurity and marlow's own mysterious nature.
