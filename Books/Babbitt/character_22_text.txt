d afterward if she was made up, but
no man living knew less of such arts.

she sat revolving her violet parasol. her voice was appealing without
being coy. "i wonder if you can help me?"

"be delighted."

"i've looked everywhere and--i want a little flat, just a bedroom, or
perhaps two, and sitting-room and kitchenette and bath, but i want one
that really has some charm to it, not these dingy places or these new
ones with terrible gaudy chandeliers. and i can't pay so dreadfully
much. my name's tanis judique."

"i think maybe i've got just the thing for you. would you like to chase
around and look at it now?"

"yes. i have a couple of hours."

in the new cavendish apartments, babbitt had a flat which he had been
holding for sidney finkelstein, but at the thought of driving beside
this agreeable woman he threw over his friend finkelstein, and with a
note of gallantry he proclaimed, "i'll let you see what i can do!"

he dusted the seat of the car for her, and twice he risked death in
showing off his

was doing now. he was wondering whether, after the summer's maturity
of being a garageman, ted would "get busy" in the university. he was
thinking of his wife. "if she would only--if she wouldn't be so darn
satisfied with just settling down--no! i won't! i won't go back! i'll
be fifty in three years. sixty in thirteen years. i'm going to have some
fun before it's too late. i don't care! i will!"

he thought of ida putiak, of louetta swanson, of that nice widow--what
was her name?--tanis judique?--the one for whom he'd found the flat. he
was enmeshed in imaginary conversations. then:

"gee, i can't seem to get away from thinking about folks!"

thus it came to him merely to run away was folly, because he could never
run away from himself.

that moment he started for zenith. in his journey there was no
appearance of flight, but he was fleeing, and four days afterward he was
on the zenith train. he knew that he was slinking back not because it
was what he longed to do but because it was a

miss mcgoun came into his private office at three in the afternoon with
"lissen, mr. babbitt; there's a mrs. judique on the 'phone--wants to see
about some repairs, and the salesmen are all out. want to talk to her?"

"all right."

the voice of tanis judique was clear and pleasant. the black cylinder
of the telephone-receiver seemed to hold a tiny animated image of her:
lustrous eyes, delicate nose, gentle chin.

"this is mrs. judique. do you remember me? you drove me up here to the
cavendish apartments and helped me find such a nice flat."

"sure! bet i remember! what can i do for you?"

"why, it's just a little--i don't know that i ought to bother you, but
the janitor doesn't seem to be able to fix it. you know my flat is on
the top floor, and wi

allen and they lined the gutters of the asphalted
streets. it was a day of pale gold and faded green, tranquil and
lingering. babbitt was aware of the meditative day, and of the
barrenness of bellevue--blocks of wooden houses, garages, little shops,
weedy lots. "needs pepping up; needs the touch that people like mrs.
judique could give a place," he ruminated, as he rattled through the
long, crude, airy streets. the wind rose, enlivening, keen, and in a
blaze of well-being he came to the flat of tanis judique.

she was wearing, when she flutteringly admitted him, a frock of black
chiffon cut modestly round at the base of her pretty throat. she seemed
to him immensely sophisticated. he glanced at the cretonnes and colored
prints in her living-room, and gurgled, "gosh, you've fixed the place
nice! takes a clever woman to know how to make a home, all right!"

"you really like it? i'm so glad! but you've neglected me, scandalously.
you promised to come some time and learn to dance."

 tilted hand again between
them. he was not merely curious now to find out whether she would
let him hold her hand (all in the purest friendship, naturally), but
agonized with need of it.

on the surface appeared none of all this fretful drama. they were
talking cheerfully of motors, of trips to california, of chum frink.
once he said delicately, "i do hate these guys--i hate these people that
invite themselves to meals, but i seem to have a feeling i'm going to
have supper with the lovely mrs. tanis judique to-night. but i suppose
you probably have seven dates already."

"well, i was thinking some of going to the movies. yes, i really think i
ought to get out and get some fresh air."

she did not encourage him to stay, but never did she discourage him.
he considered, "i better take a sneak! she will let me stay--there is
something doing--and i mustn't get mixed up with--i mustn't--i've got to
beat it." then, "no. it's too late now."

suddenly, at seven, brushing her cigarette away, brusquely takin

that they had found each other. as they fell silent the
room was stiller than a country lane. there was no sound from the street
save the whir of motor-tires, the rumble of a distant freight-train.
self-contained was the room, warm, secure, insulated from the harassing
world.

he was absorbed by a rapture in which all fear and doubting were
smoothed away; and when he reached home, at dawn, the rapture had
mellowed to contentment serene and full of memories.

the assurance of tanis judique's friendship fortified babbitt's
self-approval. at the athletic club he became experimental. though
vergil gunch was silent, the others at the roughnecks' table came to
accept babbitt as having, for no visible reason, "turned crank." they
argued windily with him, and he was cocky, and enjoyed the spectacle
of his interesting martyrdom. he even praised seneca doane. professor
pumphrey said that was carrying a joke too far; but babbitt argued, "no!
fact! i tell you he's got one of the keenest int

e snow off the running-board and examined a cracked hose-connection,
he repented, he was alarmed and astonished that he could have flared out
at his wife, and thought fondly how much more lasting she was than the
flighty bunch. he went in to mumble that he was "sorry, didn't mean to
be grouchy," and to inquire as to her interest in movies. but in the
darkness of the movie theater he brooded that he'd "gone and tied
himself up to myra all over again." he had some satisfaction in taking
it out on tanis judique. "hang tanis anyway! why'd she gone and got him
into these mix-ups and made him all jumpy and nervous and cranky? too
many complications! cut 'em out!"

he wanted peace. for ten days he did not see tanis nor telephone to her,
and instantly she put upon him the compulsion which he hated. when
he had stayed away from her for five days, hourly taking pride in his
resoluteness and hourly picturing how greatly tanis must miss him, miss
mcgoun reported, "mrs. judique on the 'phone. like t' speak t' y

"no, i don't! oh, myra, please quit nagging me about it. i'm sick of
hearing about the confounded g.c.l. i almost wish i'd joined it when
verg first came around, and got it over. and maybe i'd 've come in
to-day if the committee hadn't tried to bullyrag me, but, by god, as
long as i'm a free-born independent american cit--"

"now, george, you're talking exactly like the german furnace-man."

"oh, i am, am i! then, i won't talk at all!"

he longed, that evening, to see tanis judique, to be strengthened by
her sympathy. when all the family were up-stairs he got as far as
telephoning to her apartment-house, but he was agitated about it and
when the janitor answered he blurted, "nev' mind--i'll call later," and
hung up the receiver.

if babbitt had not been certain about vergil gunch's avoiding him, there
could be little doubt about william washington eathorne, next morning.
when babbitt was driving down to the office he overtook eathorne's car,
