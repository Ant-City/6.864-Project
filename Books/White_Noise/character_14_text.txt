devices;  the  junk  food still in shopping  bags--onion-and-garlic chips, nacho  thins, peanut creme patties,
waffelos and kabooms, fruit chews and toffee popcorn; the dum-dum pops, the mystic mints.

i've  witnessed  this  spectacle  every  september  for  twenty-one  years.  it  is  a  brilliant  event,
invariably. the students greet each other with comic cries and gestures of sodden collapse. their summer
has  been  bloated  with  criminal  pleasures,  as  always.  the  parents  stand  sun-dazed  near  their
automobiles, seeing images of themselves in every direction. the conscientious suntans. the well-made
faces and wry looks. they feel a sense of renewal, of communal recognition. the women crisp and alert,
in  diet  trim,  knowing  people's  names.  their  husbands  content  to  measure  out  the  time,  distant  but
ungrudging, accomplished in parenthood, something about them suggesting massive insur

downstairs  and  we  talked  about  the  school  supplies  they  would  need.  soon  it  was  time  for  lunch.  we
entered a period of chaos and noise. we milled about, bickered a little, dropped utensils. finally we were
all satisfied with what we'd been able to snatch from the cupboards and refrigerator or swipe from each
other and we began quietly plastering mustard or mayonnaise on our brightly colored food. the mood was
one of deadly serious anticipation, a reward hard-won. the table was crowded and babette and denise
elbowed each other twice, although neither spoke. wilder was still seated on the counter surrounded by
open cartons, crumpled tinfoil, shiny bags of potato chips, bowls of pasty substances covered with plastic

his manner kept me from asking.

we sat in his dark crowded room at the boarding house. an ironing board stood unfolded at the
window.  there  were  chipped  enamel  pots,  trays  of  utensils  set  on  a  dresser.  the  furniture  was  vague,
foundling. at the borders of the room were the elemental things. an exposed radiator, an army-blanketed
cot. dunlop sat at the edge of a straight chair, intoning generalities of grammar. when he switched from
english to german, it was as though a cord had been twisted in his larynx. an abrupt emotion entered his
voice, a scrape and gargle that sounded like the stirring of some beast's ambition. he gaped at me and
gestured,  he  croaked,  he  verged  on  strangulation.  sounds  came  spewing  from  the  base  of  his  tongue,
harsh noises damp with passion. he was only demonstrating certain basic pronunciation patterns but the
transformation in his face and voice made me think he was making a passage between levels of being.

murray came out of an aisle and walked alongside babette, just ahead of us. he took a twin roll of
paper towels out of her cart and smelled it. denise had found some friends and they went up front to look
at  the  paperback  books  in  spindly  racks,  the  books  with  shiny  metallic  print,  raised  letters,  vivid
illustrations of cult violence and windswept romance. denise was wearing a green visor. i heard babette
tell murray she'd been wearing it fourteen hours a day for three weeks now. she would not go out without
it, would not even leave her room. she wore it in school, when there was school, wore it to the toilet, the
dentist's  chair,  the  dinner  table.  something  about  the  visor  seemed  to  speak  to  her,  to  offer  wholeness
and identity.

wearing his camouflage cap and carrying an instamatic, to watch them drag for the bodies, and while he
was there word came that the treadwells had been found alive but shaken in an abandoned cookie shack
at  the  mid-village  mall,  a  vast  shopping  center  out  on  the  interstate.  apparently  they'd  been  wandering
through  the  mall  for  two  days,  lost,  confused  and  frightened,  before  taking  refuge  in  the  littered  kiosk.

we  crowded  before  the  window  in  steffie's  small  room,  watching  the  spectacular  sunset.  only  heinrich
stayed away, either because he distrusted wholesome communal pleasures or because he believed there
was something ominous in the modern sunset.

in light snow i drove to the airport outside iron city, a large town sunk in confusion, a center of

abandonment and broken glass rather than a place of fully realized urban decay. bee, my twelve-year-old,
was due in on a flight from washington, with two stops and one change of planes along the way. but it
was her mother, tweedy browner, who showed up in the arrivals area, a small dusty third-world place in a
state  of  halted  renovation.  for  a  moment  i  thought  bee  was  dead  and  tweedy  had  come  to  tell  me  in

"why does she think he's dead?"


"when  malcolm  goes  into  deep  cover,  it's  as  though  he  never  existed.  he  disappears  not  only

frankly worrisome. i  don't know which half of  malcolm's life  is real, which  half is intelligence.  i'm hoping
bee can shed some light."

traffic  lights  swayed  on  cables  in  a  sudden  gust.  this  was  the  city's  main  street,  a  series  of
discount  stores,  check-cashing  places,  wholesale  outlets.  a  tall  old  moorish  movie  theater,  now
remarkably a mosque. blank structures called the terminal building, the packer building, the commerce

at the airport we waited in a mist of plaster dust, among exposed wires, mounds of rubble. half an
hour before bee was due to arrive, the passengers from another flight began filing through a drafty tunnel
into  the  arrivals  area.  they  were  gray  and  stricken,  they  were  stooped  over  in  weariness  and  shock,
dragging their hand luggage across the floor. twenty, thirty, forty people came out, without a word or look,
keeping  their  eyes to  the ground.  some limped, some wept.  more came  through the tunnel, adults with
whimpering  children,  old  people  trembling,  a  black  minister  with  his

dimension but had crossed over illegally, made a rude incursion. i forced him to stop and face me, asked
him  what  had  happened  up  there.  as  people  kept  filing  past,  he  exhaled  wearily.  then  he  nodded,  his
eyes steady on mine, full of a gentle resignation.

by adding  one word,  to  maintain a grip on  the  future, to extend  it  in consciousness if  not in actual fact.
they patted themselves for ballpoint pens, went fetal in their seats.

by the time the narrator reached this point in his account, many people were crowded around, not
only people who'd just emerged from the tunnel but also those who'd been among the first to disembark.
they'd come back to listen. they were not yet ready to disperse, to reinhabit their earthbound bodies, but
wanted  to linger with  their  terror, keep it separate and intact  for just a while longer.  more people drifted
toward  us,  milled  about,  close  to  the  entire  planeload.  they  were  content  to  let  the  capped  and  vested
man  speak  on  their  behalf.  no  one  disputed  his  account  or  tried  to  add  individual  testimony.  it  was  as

dozens of things, hundreds of  things. the  first officer walked down the aisle, smiling and chatting in an
empty pleasant corporate way. his  face had  the rosy  and confident polish that is  familiar in handlers of
large passenger aircraft. they looked at him and wondered why they'd been afraid.

i'd been pushed away  from  the  narrator  by people crowding  in  to listen, well over a hundred of
them,  dragging  their  shoulder  bags  and  garment  bags  across  the  dusty  floor.  just  as  i  realized  i  was
almost out of hearing range, i saw bee standing next to me, her small face smooth and white in a mass of
kinky hair. she jumped up into my embrace, smelling of jet exhaust.

we found tweedy and headed out to the car. there was a traffic jam on the outskirts of the city
and  we  had  to  sit  on  a  road  outside  an  abandoned  foundry.  a  thousand  broken  windows,  street  lights
broken,  darkness  settling  in.  bee  sat  in  the  middle  of  the  rear  seat  in  the  lotus  position.  she  seemed
remarkably well rested after a journey that had spanned time zones, land masses, vast oceanic distances,
days and nights, on large and small planes, in summer and winter, from surabaya to iron city. now we
sat waiting in the dark for a car to get towed or a drawbridge to close. bee didn't think this familiar irony of
modern  travel was worth  a comment. she just sat  there listening  to tweedy explain to me why p

it's one of the things i'm proudest to have accomplished with bee. i sent her to boston on eastern when
she was nine. i told granny browner not to meet her plane. getting out of airports is every bit as important
as  the  actual  flight.  too  many  parents  ignore  this  phase  of  a  child's  development.  bee  is  thoroughly
bicoastal now. she flew her first jumbo at ten, changed planes at o'hare, had a near miss in los angeles.
two weeks later she took the concorde to london. malcolm was waiting with a split of champagne."

bee  made  us  feel  self-conscious  at  times,  a  punishment  that  visitors  will  unintentionally  inflict  on  their
complacent hosts. her presence seemed to radiate a surgical light. we began to see ourselves as a group
that acted without design, avoided making decisions, took turns being stupid and emotionally unstable, left
wet  towels  everywhere,  mislaid  our  youngest  member.  whatever  we  did  was  suddenly  a  thing  that
seemed to need explaining. my wife was especially disconcerte

d. if denise was a pint-sized commissar,
nagging us to higher conscience, then bee was a silent witness, calling the very meaning of our lives into
question. i watched babette stare into her cupped hands, aghast.
that chirping sound was just the radiator.


bee was  quietly disdainful of wisecracks, sarcasm and other  family business.  a year older than
denise,  she  was  taller,  thinner,  paler,  both  worldly  and  ethereal,  as  though  in  her  heart  she  was  not  a
travel  writer  at  all,  as  her  mother  had  said  she  wished  to  be,  but  simply  a  traveler,  the  purer  form,
someone who collects impressions, dense anatomies of feeling, but does not care to record them.

took taxis to school and dance class, spoke a little chinese, had once wired money to a stranded friend. i
admired her in a distant and uneasy way, sensing a nameless threat, as if she were not my child at all but
the sophisticated and self-reliant friend of one of my children. was murray right? were we a fragile unit
surrounded by hostile facts? would i promote ignorance, prejudice and superstition to protect my family
from the world?

on  christmas  day,  bee  sat  by  the  fireplace  in  our  seldom  used  living  room,  watching  the
turquoise flames. she wore a long loose khaki outfit that looked casually expensive. i sat in the armchair
with three or four gift boxes in my lap, apparel and tissue paper hanging out. my dog-eared copy of mein
kampf rested on the floor at the side of the chair. some of the other people were in the kitchen preparing
the  meal,  some  had  gone  upstairs  to  investigate  their  gifts  in  private.  the  tv  said:  "t

bee was small-featured except for her eyes, which seemed to contain two forms of life, the subject matter
and its hidden implications. she talked about babette's effortless skills in making things work, the house,
the  kids,  the  flow  of  the  routine  universe,  sounding  a  little  like  me,  but  there  was  a  secondary  sea-life
moving deep in the iris of her eye. what did it  mean,  what was she really saying, why did she seem to

"it's still dirt."

"well it's my dirt and i don't care."

"it's dirt," denise said.

"it's my dirt."

"dirt is dirt."

"not when it's mine."


bee appeared at the end of the hall wearing a silver and red kimono. just stood there, distant and
pale.  there  was  a  moment  in  which  our  locus  of  pettiness  and  shame  seemed  palpably  to  expand,  a
cartoon  of  self-awareness.  denise  muttered  something  violent  to  steffie  through  the  crack  in  the  door,
then went quietly to her room.

in the morning i drove bee to the airport. rides to airports make me quiet and glum. we listened
to  news  updates  on  the  radio,  curiously

  excited  reports  about  firemen  removing  a  burning  sofa  from  a

watching  me  carefully,  importantly.  she  sat  with  her  back  against  the  door,  her  knees  up,  held  tightly
together,  arms  enfolding  them.  the  look  was  one  of  solemn  compassion.  it  was  a  look  i  did  not
necessarily  trust,  believing  it  had  little  to  do  with  pity  or  love  or  sadness.  i  recognized  it  in  fact  as
something else completely. the adolescent female's tenderest form of condescension.

the girls looked at each other again, a solemn and lingering exchange that indicated some dark
suspicion  was  being  confirmed.  air-raid  sirens  sounded  again,  this  time  so  close  to  us  that  we  were
negatively affected, shaken to the point of avoiding each other's eyes as a way of denying that something
unusual was going on. the sound came from our own red brick firehouse, sirens that hadn't been tested in
a  decade  or  more.  they  made  a  noise  like  some  territorial  squawk  from  out  of  the  mesozoic.  a  parrot
carnivore with a dc-9 wingspan. what a raucousness of brute aggression filled the house, making it seem
as though the walls would fly apart. so close to us, so surely upon us. amazing to think this sonic monster
lay hidden nearby for years.

seal the doors, huddle on camp beds with our juice and coffee, wait for the all-clear.

cars began to mount the grassy incline at the edge of the road, creating a third lane of severely
tilted traffic. situated in what had formerly been the righthand lane, we didn't have any choice but to watch
these cars pass us at a slightly higher elevation and with a rakish thrust, deviated from the horizontal.
slowly we approached an overpass, seeing people on foot up  there. they carried boxes and suitcases,
objects in blankets, a long line  of people leaning  into  the blowing snow.  people cradling pets and small
children, an old man wearing a blanket over his pajamas, two women shouldering a rolled-up rug. there

completely in plastic, a single large sheet of transparent polyethylene. they walked beneath their shield in
lock step, the man and woman each at one end, three kids between, all of them secondarily wrapped in
shimmering  rainwear.  the  whole  affair  had  about  it  a  well-rehearsed  and  self-satisfied  look,  as  though
they'd been waiting for months to strut their stuff. people kept appearing from behind a high rampart and
trudging across the overpass, shoulders dusted with snow, hundreds of people moving with a kind of fated
determination. a new round of sirens started up. the trudging people did not quicken their pace, did not
look down at us or into the night sky for some sign of the wind-driven cloud. they just kept moving across
the  bridge  through  patches  of  snow-raging  light.  out  in  the  open,  keeping  t

brightly colored plastic utensils were scattered for some distance. there was no sign of victims or fresh
blood, leading us to believe that some time had passed since the recreational vehicle mounted the plow,
probably in a moment when opportunism seemed an easily defensible failing, given the situation. it must
have been the blinding snow  that caused the driver to leap the  median without noting an  object on the
other side.

babette had told her. déjà vu, however, was no longer a working symptom of nyodene contamination. it
had been preempted by coma, convulsions, and miscarriage. if steffie had learned about déjà vu on the
radio but then missed the subsequent upgrading to more deadly conditions, it could mean she was in a
position  to  be  tricked  by  her  own  apparatus  of  suggestibility.  she  and  denise  had  been  lagging  all

it possible to have a false perception of an illusion? is there a true déjà vu and a false déjà vu? i wondered
whether her palms had been truly sweaty or whether she'd simply imagined a sense of wetness. and was
she so open to suggestion that she would develop every symptom as it was announced?

the whole thing was amazing. they seemed to be spotlighting the cloud for us as if it were part of

slain.  but  this  was  not  history  we  were  witnessing.  it  was  some  secret  festering  thing,  some  dreamed
emotion that accompanies the dreamer out of sleep. flares came swooning from the helicopters, creamy

déjà vu was still a problem in the area. a toll-free hotline had been set up. there were counselors

i had my second medical checkup since the toxic event. no startling numbers on the printout. this death
was still too deep to be glimpsed. my doctor,  sundar  chakravarty, asked me about  the sudden  flurry of
checkups. in the past i'd always been afraid to know.

headed out the door.

on the way home i drove down elm intending to make a quick stop at the supermarket. the street
was full of emergency vehicles. farther down i saw bodies scattered about. a man with an armband blew
a. whistle at me and stepped in front of my car. i glimpsed other men in mylex suits. stretcher-bearers ran
across the street. when the man with the whistle drew closer, i was able to make out the letters on his
armband: simuvac.

sat  on  the  floor  in  a  hooded  sweatshirt,  watching  live  coverage  of  the  same  scene.  the  backyard  was
floodlit,  men  with  picks  and  shovels  worked  amid  mounds  of  dirt.  in  the  foreground  stood  the  reporter,
bareheaded,  in  a  sheepskin  coat,  in  a  light  snow,  giving  an  update.  the  police  said  they  had  solid

dejection, a sorry gloom. we felt it ourselves, my son and i, quietly watching. it was in the room, seeping

plausible identity. what had been elusive about howard dunlop was now pinned down. what had been

the great work of containing the blaze went on, a labor that seemed as old and lost as cathedral-

soon  there  was  a  smell  of  acrid  matter.  it  could  have  been  insulation  burning--polystyrene
sheathing for pipes and wires-- or one or more of a dozen other substances. a sharp and bitter stink filled
the  air,  overpowering  the  odor  of  smoke  and  charred  stone.  it  changed  the  mood  of  the  people  on  the
sidewalk.  some  put  hankies  to  their  faces,  others  left  abruptly  in  disgust.  whatever  caused  the  odor,  i
sensed  that  it  made  people  feel  betrayed.  an  ancient,  spacious  and  terrible  drama  was  being

one was real, the other synthetic. the odor drove us away but beneath it and far worse was the sense
that death came two ways, sometimes at once, and how death entered your mouth and nose, how death
smelled, could somehow make a difference to your soul.

keeping the truth from her. the girl would embrace the truth, know us better, love us more deeply in our
weakness and fear.

pel. i spoke in german, from notes, for five minutes. i
talked mainly about hitler's mother, brother and dog. his dog's name was wolf. this word is the same in
english and german. most of the words i used in my address were the same or nearly the same in both
languages. i'd spent days with the dictionary, compiling lists of such words. my remarks were necessarily
disjointed and odd. i made many references to wolf, many more to the mother and the brother, a few to
shoes and socks, a few to jazz, beer and baseball. of course there was hitler himself. i spoke the name
often, hoping it would overpower my insecure sentence structure.

the rest of the time i tried to avoid the germans in the group. even in my black gown and dark
glasses,  with  my  name  in  nazi  typeface  over  my  heart,  i  felt  feeble  in  their  presence,  death-prone,
listening to them produce their guttural sounds, their words, their heavy metal. they told hitler jokes and
