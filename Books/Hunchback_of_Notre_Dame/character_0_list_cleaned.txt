[CHARACTER] - 
      the hunchback of notre dame. [CHARACTER] is an abandoned child left at notre dame and adopted by archdeacon claude frollo. hideously deformed, he has a giant humpback, a protrusion coming out of his chest, and a giant wart that covers one of his eyes. he is also deaf. his heart is pure, and this purity is linked to the cathedral itself. indeed, his love for notre dame's bells and for the beautiful sound of their ringing represents his only form of communication. the whole of paris ironically enjoys [CHARACTER]'s singing while at the same time detesting him for his ugliness. his name literally means "half-made."
