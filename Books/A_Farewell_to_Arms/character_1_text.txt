e and i soon forgot it and carried it 
flopping against the small of my back with no feeling at 
all except a vague sort of shame when i met english- 
speaking people. i sat now in the chair and an orderly 
of some sort looked at me disapprovingly from behind 
a desk while i looked at the marble floor, the pillars 
with the marble busts, and the frescoes on the wall 
and waited for miss barkley. the frescoes were not 
bad. any frescoes were good when they started to peel 
and flake off. 

i saw catherine barkley coming down the hall, and 
stood up. she did not seem tall walking toward me but 
she looked very lovely. 

"good-evening, mr. henry," she said. 

"how do you do?" i said. the orderly was listening 
behind the desk. 

"shall we sit here or go out in the garden?" 

"let's go out. it's much cooler." 

i walked behind her out into the garden, the orderly 
looking after us. when we were out on the gravel drive 
she said, "where have you been?" 

"i've been out on post." 

"you couldn't have sent me

rench had mutinied and troops marched on paris. 
i asked him what happened and he said, "oh, they 
stopped them." i wanted to go to austria without war. 
i wanted to go to the black forest. i wanted to go to 
the hartz mountains. where were the hartz moun- 
tains anyway? they were fighting in the carpathians. 
i did not want to go there anyway. it might be good 
though. i could go to spain if there was no war. the 
sun was going down and the day was cooling off. after 
supper i would go and see catherine barkley. i wished 
she were here now. i wished i were in milan with her. 
i would like to eat at the cova and then walk down the 
via manzoni in the hot evening and cross over and

erine barkley. maybe she would. maybe she would 
pretend that i was her boy that was killed and we would 
go in the front door and the porter would take off his 
cap and i would stop at the concierge's desk and ask 
for the key and she would

cause we would not wear any clothes because it was 
so hot and the window open and the swallows flying 
over the roofs of the houses and when it was dark 
afterward and you went to the window very small bats 
hunting over the houses and close down over the trees 
and we would drink the capri and the door locked and 
it hot and only a sheet and the whole night and we 
would both love each other all night in the hot night in 
milan. that was how it ought to be. i would eat 
quickly and go and see catherine barkley. 

they talked too much at the mess and i drank wine 
because to-night we were not all brothers unless i drank 
a little and talked with the priest about archbishop 
ireland who was, it seemed, a noble man and with whose 
injustice, the injustices he had received and in which i 
participated as an american, and of which i had never 
heard, i feigned acquaintance. it would have been im- 
polite not to have known something of them when i had

. at the gate of the driveway that 
led up to the british villa, rinaldi said good-night. 

"good-night," i said. "why don't you come in?" 

he shook his head. "no," he said, "i like the sim- 
pler pleasures." 

"thank you for the coffee beans." 

"nothing, baby. nothing." 

i started down the driveway. the outlines of the 
cypresses that lined it were sharp and clear. i looked 
back and saw rinaldi standing watching me and waved 
to him. 

i sat in the reception hall of the villa, waiting for 
catherine barkley to come down. some one was com- 
ing down the hall-way. i stood up, but it was not 
catherine. it was miss ferguson. 

"hello," she said. "catherine asked me to tell you 
she was sorry she couldn't see you this evening."

"i'm so sorry. i hope she's not ill." 

"she's not awfully well." 

"will you tell her how sorry i am?" 

"yes, i will." 

"do you think it would be any good to try and see 
her to-morrow ?" 

"yes, i do." 

"thank you very much," i said. "good-night

drew his forefinger across his throat. 

"ho ho ho," he tried to keep from laughing. 
"when i tell him you were not an austrian. ho ho 
ho." 

"ho ho ho," i said bitterly. "how funny if he 
would cut my throat. ho ho ho." 

"no, signorino. no, no. he was so frightened of 
an austrian. ho ho ho." 

"ho ho ho," i said. "get out of here." 

he went out and i heard him laughing in the hall. 
i heard some one coming down the hallway. i looked 
toward the door. it was catherine barkley. 

she came in the room and over to the bed. 

"hello, darling," she said. she looked fresh and 
young and very beautiful. i thought i had never seen 
any one so beautiful. 

"hello," i said. when i saw her i was in love with 
her. everything turned over inside of me. she 
looked toward the door, saw there was no one, then she

me. i pulled her down and kissed her and felt her 
heart beating.

miss gage was with me and the doctor put his arm 
around her and said she was more beautiful than cleo-

a while and much lifting i was upstairs and in bed 
again. the plates came that afternoon, the doctor had

did. catherine barkley showed them to me. they 
were in red envelopes and she took them out of the en- 
velopes and held them up to the light and we both 
looked. 

"that's your right leg," she said, then put the plate 
back in the envelope. "this is your left." 

"put them away," i said, "and come over to the 
bed." 

"i can't," she said. "i just brought them in for a 
second to show you." 

she went out and i lay there. it was a hot after- 
noon and i was sick of lying in bed. i sent the porter

there were three other patients in the hospital now, 
a thin boy in the red cross from georgia with mala- 
ria, a nice boy, also thin, from new york, with mala- 
ria and jaundice, and a fine boy who had tried to un- 
screw the fuse-cap from a combination shrapnel and 
high explosive shell for a souvenir. this was a shrap- 
nel shell used by the austrians in the mountains with a 
nose-cap which went on after the burst and exploded 
on contact. 

catherine barkley was greatly liked by the nurses 
because she would do night duty indefinitely. she had 
quite a little work with the malaria people, the boy who

e girl. i never learned anything about her except 
that she had a brother in the fifty-second division 
and a brother in mesopotamia and she was very good 
to catherine barkley. 

"will you come to our wedding, fergy?" i said to 
her once. 

"you'll never get married." 

"we will." 

"no you won't." 

"why not?" 

"you'll fight before you'll marry." 

"we never fight." 

"you've time yet." 

"we don't fight." 

"you'll die then. fight or die. that's what people 
do. they don't marry." 

i reached for her hand. "don't take hold of me," 
she said. "i'm not crying. maybe you'll be all right 
you two. but watch out you don't get her in trouble.

"you're awfully damned nice." 

"no. i know who you think is nice. but i'm your

"fine." 

"i'll bring some cold mineral water to pour over it. 
it must itch under the cast. it's hot outside." 

"you're awful nice." 

"does it itch much?" 

"no. it's fine." 

"i'll fix those sandbags better." she leaned over. 
"i'm your friend." 

"i know you are."

catherine barkley took three nights off night duty 
and then she came back on again. it was as though we 
met again after each of us had been away on a long 
journey. 



chapter xviii 

we had a lovely time that summer. when i could 
go out we rode in a carriage in the park. i remember 
the carriage, the horse going slowly, and up ahead the 
back of the driver with his varnished high hat, and 
catherine barkley sitting beside me. if we let our 
hands touch, just the side of my hand touching hers, 
we were excit

snake. a snake with an italian uniform: with a cape 
around your neck." 

"i haven't got an italian uniform now." 

"that's just another example of your sneakiness. 
you had a love affair all summer and got this girl with 
child and now i suppose you'll sneak off." 

i smiled at catherine and she smiled at me. 

"we'll both sneak off," she said. 

"you're two of the same thing," ferguson said. 
"i'm ashamed of you, catherine barkley. you have 
no shame and no honor and you're as sneaky as he is." 

"don't, fergy," catherine said and patted her hand. 
"don't denounce me. you know we like each other." 

"take your hand away," ferguson said. her face 
was red. "if you had any shame it would be different. 
but you're god knows how many months gone with 
child and you think it's a joke and are all smiles because 
your seducer's come back. you've no shame and no 
feelings." she began to cry. catherine went over and
