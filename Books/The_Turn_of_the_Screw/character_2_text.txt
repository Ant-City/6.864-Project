days, to look
after the small boy, who had been for a term at school--young as he was
to be sent, but what else could be done?--and who, as the holidays were
about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. there had
been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the
misfortune to lose. she had done for them quite beautifully--she was a
most respectable person--till her death, the great awkwardness of which
had, precisely, left no alternative but the school for little miles.
mrs. grose, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as
she could for flora; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a
dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all likewise
thoroughly respectable.

so far had douglas presented his picture when someone put a question.
â€œand what did the former governess die of?--of so much respectability?â€

our friendâ€™s answer was prompt. â€œthat will come out. i donâ€™t
anticipate.â€

â€œexcuse me--i thought that wa

 better have let it wait till morning, for it gave me
a second sleepless night. with no counsel to take, the next day, i
was full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me that i
determined to open myself at least to mrs. grose.

â€œwhat does it mean? the childâ€™s dismissed his school.â€

she gave me a look that i remarked at the moment; then, visibly, with a
quick blankness, seemed to try to take it back. â€œbut arenâ€™t they all--?â€

â€œsent home--yes. but only for the holidays. miles may never go back at
all.â€

consciously, under my attention, she reddened. â€œthey wonâ€™t take him?â€

â€œthey absolutely decline.â€

at this she raised her eyes, which she had turned from me; i saw them
fill with good tears. â€œwhat has he done?â€

i hesitated; then i judged best simply to hand her my letter--which,
however, had the effect of making her, without taking it, simply put her
hands behind her. she shook her head sadly. â€œsuch things are not for me,
miss.â€

en say so?â€

â€œthey go into no particulars. they simply express their regret that it
should be impossible to keep him. that can have only one meaning.â€
 mrs. grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what
this meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some
coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, i went
on: â€œthat heâ€™s an injury to the others.â€

at this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly flamed
up. â€œmaster miles! him an injury?â€

there was such a flood of good faith in it that, though i had not yet
seen the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea.
i found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot,
sarcastically. â€œto his poor little innocent mates!â€

â€œitâ€™s too dreadful,â€ cried mrs. grose, â€œto say such cruel things! why,
heâ€™s scarce ten years old.â€

â€œyes, yes; it would be incredible.â€

she was evidently grateful for such a profession. â€œs

but our young lady never came back, and at the very moment i was
expecting her i heard from the master that she was dead.â€

i turned this over. â€œbut of what?â€

â€œhe never told me! but please, miss,â€ said mrs. grose, â€œi must get to my
work.â€

her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just
preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem.
we met, after i had brought home little miles, more intimately than ever
on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous was i
then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to
me should be under an interdict. i was a little late on the scene, and
i felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me before the door of the
inn at which the coach had put him down, that i had seen him, on the
instant, without and within, in the great glow of freshness, the same
positive fragrance of purity, in which i had

was
rooted as deeply as i was shaken. was there a â€œsecretâ€ at bly--a mystery
of udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected
confinement? i canâ€™t say how long i turned it over, or how long, in
a confusion of curiosity and dread, i remained where i had had my
collision; i only recall that when i re-entered the house darkness had
quite closed in. agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and
driven me, for i must, in circling about the place, have walked three
miles; but i was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this
mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. the most singular
part of it, in fact--singular as the rest had been--was the part i
became, in the hall, aware of in meeting mrs. grose. this picture comes
back to me in the general train--the impression, as i received it on my
return, of the wide white panelled space, bright in the lamplight and
with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of
my friend, which

lous traveler, curious in old houses, had made his way in
unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and then
stolen out as he came. if he had given me such a bold hard stare, that
was but a part of his indiscretion. the good thing, after all, was that
we should surely see no more of him.

this was not so good a thing, i admit, as not to leave me to judge that
what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming
work. my charming work was just my life with miles and flora, and
through nothing could i so like it as through feeling that i could throw
myself into it in trouble. the attraction of my small charges was a
constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original
fears, the distaste i had begun by entertaining for the probable gray
prose of my office. there was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no
long grind; so how could work not be charming that presented itself as
daily beauty? it was all the romance of the nursery and the

made the whole charge absurd. my conclusion bloomed there with the
real rose flush of his innocence: he was only too fine and fair for the
little horrid, unclean school world, and he had paid a price for it. i
reflected acutely that the sense of such differences, such superiorities
of quality, always, on the part of the majority--which could include
even stupid, sordid headmasters--turn infallibly to the vindictive.

both the children had a gentleness (it was their only fault, and it
never made miles a muff) that kept them--how shall i express it?--almost
impersonal and certainly quite unpunishable. they were like the cherubs
of the anecdote, who had--morally, at any rate--nothing to whack! i
remember feeling with miles in especial as if he had had, as it were, no
history. we expect of a small child a scant one, but there was in
this beautiful little boy something extraordinarily sensitive, yet
extraordinarily happy, that, more than in any creature of his age i have
seen, struck me as begin

a that, by good
fortune, could steady us. it was the idea, the second movement, that led
me straight out, as i may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. i could
take the air in the court, at least, and there mrs. grose could join me.
perfectly can i recall now the particular way strength came to me before
we separated for the night. we had gone over and over every feature of
what i had seen.

â€œhe was looking for someone else, you say--someone who was not you?â€

â€œhe was looking for little miles.â€ a portentous clearness now possessed
me. â€œthatâ€™s whom he was looking for.â€

â€œbut how do you know?â€

â€œi know, i know, i know!â€ my exaltation grew. â€œand you know, my dear!â€

she didnâ€™t deny this, but i required, i felt, not even so much telling
as that. she resumed in a moment, at any rate: â€œwhat if he should see
him?â€

â€œlittle miles? thatâ€™s what he wants!â€

she looked immensely scared again. â€œthe child?â€

things i said that night to mrs. grose.

â€œit does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned--â€

she looked at me hard as i musingly pulled up. â€œhis having been here and
the time they were with him?â€

â€œthe time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history,
in any way.â€

â€œoh, the little lady doesnâ€™t remember. she never heard or knew.â€

â€œthe circumstances of his death?â€ i thought with some intensity.
â€œperhaps not. but miles would remember--miles would know.â€

â€œah, donâ€™t try him!â€ broke from mrs. grose.

i returned her the look she had given me. â€œdonâ€™t be afraid.â€ i continued
to think. â€œit is rather odd.â€

â€œthat he has never spoken of him?â€

â€œnever by the least allusion. and you tell me they were â€˜great
friendsâ€™?â€

â€œoh, it wasnâ€™t him!â€ mrs. grose with emphasis declared. â€œit was quintâ€™s
own fancy. to play with him, i mean--to spoil him.â€ she paused a moment;
then she added:

ess they would. i began to watch them in a stifled
suspense, a disguised excitement that might well, had it continued too
long, have turned to something like madness. what saved me, as i now
see, was that it turned to something else altogether. it didnâ€™t last as
suspense--it was superseded by horrible proofs. proofs, i say, yes--from
the moment i really took hold.

this moment dated from an afternoon hour that i happened to spend in the
grounds with the younger of my pupils alone. we had left miles indoors,
on the red cushion of a deep window seat; he had wished to finish a
book, and i had been glad to encourage a purpose so laudable in a young
man whose only defect was an occasional excess of the restless. his
sister, on the contrary, had been alert to come out, and i strolled with
her half an hour, seeking the shade, for the sun was still high and the
day exceptionally warm. i was aware afresh, with her, as we went, of
how, like her brother, she contrived--it was the charming thing in b

ccasion--for the sleeping house and the
concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help--i felt
the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain. â€œi donâ€™t
believe anything so horrible,â€ i recollect saying; â€œno, let us put it
definitely, my dear, that i donâ€™t. but if i did, you know, thereâ€™s
a thing i should require now, just without sparing you the least bit
more--oh, not a scrap, come!--to get out of you. what was it you had in
mind when, in our distress, before miles came back, over the letter from
his school, you said, under my insistence, that you didnâ€™t pretend for
him that he had not literally ever been â€˜badâ€™? he has not literally
â€˜ever,â€™ in these weeks that i myself have lived with him and so closely
watched him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful,
lovable goodness. therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for
him if you had not, as it happened, seen an exception to take. what was
your exception, and to what pa

ose. it was neither more nor less than the circumstance that for
a period of several months quint and the boy had been perpetually
together. it was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had
ventured to criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of
so close an alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank
overture to miss jessel. miss jessel had, with a most strange manner,
requested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this,
directly approached little miles. what she had said to him, since i
pressed, was that she liked to see young gentlemen not forget their
station.

i pressed again, of course, at this. â€œyou reminded him that quint was
only a base menial?â€

â€œas you might say! and it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.â€

â€œand for another thing?â€ i waited. â€œhe repeated your words to quint?â€

â€œno, not that. itâ€™s just what he wouldnâ€™t!â€ she could still impress upon
me. â€œi was sure, at any rate,â€ she added, â€œthat

 said in my torment, â€œyou must put it to me again, but i shall not be
able to tell you for some days. only, put it to me again!â€ i cried in a
way that made my friend stare. â€œthere are directions in which i must
not for the present let myself go.â€ meanwhile i returned to her first
example--the one to which she had just previously referred--of the boyâ€™s
happy capacity for an occasional slip. â€œif quint--on your remonstrance
at the time you speak of--was a base menial, one of the things miles
said to you, i find myself guessing, was that you were another.â€ again
her admission was so adequate that i continued: â€œand you forgave him
that?â€

â€œwouldnâ€™t you?â€

â€œoh, yes!â€ and we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound of the
oddest amusement. then i went on: â€œat all events, while he was with the
man--â€

â€œmiss flora was with the woman. it suited them all!â€

it suited me, too, i felt, only too well; by which i mean that it suited

tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of
the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of memory. they not
only popped out at me as tigers and as romans, but as shakespeareans,
astronomers, and navigators. this was so singularly the case that it had
presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day,
i am at a loss for a different explanation: i allude to my unnatural
composure on the subject of another school for miles. what i remember
is that i was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that
contentment must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking
show of cleverness. he was too clever for a bad governess, for a
parsonâ€™s daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not the brightest
thread in the pensive embroidery i just spoke of was the impression i
might have got, if i had dared to work it out, that he was under some
influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremend

diminished by distance, who stood there motionless and as if fascinated,
looking up to where i had appeared--looking, that is, not so much
straight at me as at something that was apparently above me. there was
clearly another person above me--there was a person on the tower; but
the presence on the lawn was not in the least what i had conceived and
had confidently hurried to meet. the presence on the lawn--i felt sick
as i made it out--was poor little miles himself.

it was not till late next day that i spoke to mrs. grose; the rigor with
which i kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet
her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of not
provoking--on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the
children--any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of
mysteries. i drew a great security in this particular from her mere
smooth aspect. there was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to ot

a view of the back of the tapestry. i had made her a receptacle of
lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority--my
accomplishments and my function--in her patience under my pain. she
offered her mind to my disclosures as, had i wished to mix a witchâ€™s
broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a large
clean saucepan. this had become thoroughly her attitude by the time
that, in my recital of the events of the night, i reached the point of
what miles had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a monstrous
hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be, i had gone
down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated
need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more
resonant. i had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of
representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the
real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after i had got him
into the house,

â€œi donâ€™t change--i simply make it out. the four, depend upon it,

either child, you would clearly have understood. the more iâ€™ve watched
and waited the more iâ€™ve felt that if there were nothing else to make it
sure it would be made so by the systematic silence of each. never, by a
slip of the tongue, have they so much as alluded to either of their old
friends, any more than miles has alluded to his expulsion. oh, yes,
we may sit here and look at them, and they may show off to us there to
their fill; but even while they pretend to be lost in their fairytale
theyâ€™re steeped in their vision of the dead restored. heâ€™s not reading
to her,â€ i declared; â€œtheyâ€™re talking of them--theyâ€™re talking horrors!

it revealed a real acceptance of my further proof of what, in the bad
time--for there had been a worse even than this!--must have occurred.
there could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent
of her experience to whatever depth of depravity i found credible in
our brace of scoundrels. it was in obvious submission of memory that she
brought out after a moment: â€œthey were rascals! but what can they now
do?â€ she pursued.

â€œdo?â€ i echoed so loud that miles and flora, as they passed at their
distance, paused an instant in their walk and looked at us. â€œdonâ€™t
they do enough?â€ i demanded in a lower tone, while the children, having
smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us, resumed their exhibition. we
were held by it a minute; then i answered: â€œthey can destroy them!â€ at
this my companion did turn, but the inquiry she launched was a silent
one, the effect of which was to make me more explicit. â€œthey donâ€™t know,
as yet, quite how--but the

they were not angels, they â€œpassed,â€ as the french say, causing me,
while they stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their
younger victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than
they had thought good enough for myself.

what it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that,
whatever i had seen, miles and flora saw more--things terrible and
unguessable and that sprang from dreadful passages of intercourse in the
past. such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a chill
which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three, with
repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each time,
almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the
very same movements. it was striking of the children, at all events,
to kiss me inveterately with a kind o

walking to church a certain sunday morning, i had little miles at my
side and his sister, in advance of us and at mrs. groseâ€™s, well in
sight. it was a crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time;
the night had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air, bright
and sharp, made the church bells almost gay. it was an odd accident of
thought that i should have happened at such a moment to be particularly
and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little charges. why
did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society? something o

i had all but pinned the boy to
my shawl and that, in the way our companions were marshaled before me,
i might have appeared to provide against some danger of rebellion. i
was like a gaoler with an eye to possible surprises and escapes. but all
this belonged--i mean their magnificent little surrender--just to the
special array of the facts that were most abysmal. turned out for sunday
by his uncleâ€™s tailor, who had had a free hand and a notion of
pretty waistcoats and of his grand little air, milesâ€™s whole title to
independence, the rights of his sex and situation, were so stamped upon
him that if he had suddenly struck for freedom i should have had nothing
to say. i was by the strangest of chances wondering how i should meet
him when the revolution unmistakably occurred. i call it a revolution
because i now see how, with the word he spoke, the curtain rose on the
last act of my dreadful drama, and the catastrophe was precipitated.
â€œlook here, my dear, you know,â€ he charmingly said,

, iâ€™m a fellow, donâ€™t you see? thatâ€™s--well, getting on.â€

i lingered there with him an instant ever so kindly. â€œyes, youâ€™re
getting on.â€ oh, but i felt helpless!

i have kept to this day the heartbreaking little idea of how he seemed
to know that and to play with it. â€œand you canâ€™t say iâ€™ve not been
awfully good, can you?â€

i laid my hand on his shoulder, for, though i felt how much better it
would have been to walk on, i was not yet quite able. â€œno, i canâ€™t say
that, miles.â€

â€œexcept just that one night, you know--!â€

â€œthat one night?â€ i couldnâ€™t look as straight as he.

â€œwhy, when i went down--went out of the house.â€

â€œoh, yes. but i forget what you did it for.â€

â€œyou forget?â€--he spoke with the sweet extravagance of childish
reproach. â€œwhy, it was to show you i could!â€

â€œoh, yes, you could.â€

â€œand i can again.â€

i felt that i might, perhaps, after all, succeed in keeping my wits
about me. â€œcertainly. but you wonâ€™t.â€

we must go on.â€

he resumed our walk with me, passing his hand into my arm. â€œthen when am
i going back?â€

i wore, in turning it over, my most responsible air. â€œwere you very
happy at school?â€

he just considered. â€œoh, iâ€™m happy enough anywhere!â€

â€œwell, then,â€ i quavered, â€œif youâ€™re just as happy here--!â€

â€œah, but that isnâ€™t everything! of course you know a lot--â€

â€œbut you hint that you know almost as much?â€ i risked as he paused.

â€œnot half i want to!â€ miles honestly professed. â€œbut it isnâ€™t so much
that.â€

â€œwhat is it, then?â€

â€œwell--i want to see more life.â€

â€œi see; i see.â€ we had arrived within sight of the church and of various
persons, including several of the household of bly, on their way to it
and clustered about the door to see us go in. i quickened our step;
i wanted to get there before the question between us opened up much
further; i reflected hungrily that, for more than an hour, he would have
to be silent; and i tho

and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on which i might bend
my knees. i seemed literally to be running a race with some confusion
to which he was about to reduce me, but i felt that he had got in first
when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he threw out--

â€œi want my own sort!â€

it literally made me bound forward. â€œthere are not many of your own
sort, miles!â€ i laughed. â€œunless perhaps dear little flora!â€

â€œyou really compare me to a baby girl?â€

this found me singularly weak. â€œdonâ€™t you, then, love our sweet flora?â€

â€œif i didnâ€™t--and you, too; if i didnâ€™t--!â€ he repeated as if retreating
for a jump, yet leaving his thought so unfinished that, after we had
come into the gate, another stop, which he imposed on me by the pressure
of his arm, had become inevitable. mrs. grose and flora had passed into

â€œyes, if you didnâ€™t--?â€

he looked, while i waited, at the graves. â€œwell, you know what!â€ but
he didnâ€™t move, and he presently produced something that made me drop
straight down on the stone slab, as if suddenly to rest. â€œdoes my uncle
think what you think?â€

i markedly rested. â€œhow do you know what i think?â€

â€œah, well, of course i donâ€™t; for it strikes me you never tell me. but i
mean does he know?â€

â€œknow what, miles?â€

â€œwhy, the way iâ€™m going on.â€

i perceived quickly enough that i could make, to this inquiry, no answer
that would not involve something of a sacrifice of my employer. yet it
appeared to me that we were all, at bly, sufficiently sacrificed to make
that venial. â€œi donâ€™t think your uncle much cares.â€

miles, on this, stood looking at me. â€œthen donâ€™t you think he can be
made to?â€

â€œin what way?â€

â€œwhy, by his coming down.â€

â€œbut whoâ€™ll get him to come down?â€

 practically settled from the moment i never followed
him. it was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this
had somehow no power to restore me. i only sat there on my tomb and read
into what my little friend had said to me the fullness of its meaning;
by the time i had grasped the whole of which i had also embraced, for
absence, the pretext that i was ashamed to offer my pupils and the rest
of the congregation such an example of delay. what i said to myself
above all was that miles had got something out of me and that the proof
of it, for him, would be just this awkward collapse. he had got out
of me that there was something i was much afraid of and that he should
probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose,
more freedom. my fear was of having to deal with the intolerable
question of the grounds of his dismissal from school, for that was
really but the question of the horrors gathered behind. that his uncle
should arrive to treat with me of these

â€œi only went with you for the walk,â€ i said. â€œi had then to come back to

she showed her surprise. â€œa friend--you?â€

â€œoh, yes, i have a couple!â€ i laughed. â€œbut did the children give you a
reason?â€

â€œfor not alluding to your leaving us? yes; they said you would like it
better. do you like it better?â€

my face had made her rueful. â€œno, i like it worse!â€ but after an instant
i added: â€œdid they say why i should like it better?â€

â€œno; master miles only said, â€˜we must do nothing but what she likes!â€™â€

â€œi wish indeed he would. and what did flora say?â€

â€œwell, thereâ€™s that awful reason.â€

was excusable for being vague. â€œbut--a--whic

â€œwell--tonight,â€ i at last answered; and on this we separated.

i went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning. the weather had
changed back, a great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp, in my room,
with flora at peace beside me, i sat for a long time before a blank
sheet of paper and listened to the lash of the rain and the batter of
the gusts. finally i went out, taking a candle; i crossed the passage
and listened a minute at milesâ€™s door. what, under my endless obsession,
i had been impelled to listen for was some betrayal of his not being at
rest, and i presently caught one, but not in the form i had expected.
his voice tinkled out. â€œi say, you there--come in.â€ it was a gaiety in
the gloom!

i went in with my light and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but very
much at his ease. â€œwell, what are you up to?â€ he asked with a grace of
sociability in which it occurred to me that mrs. grose, had she been
present,

d think.â€

i had put my candle, designedly, a short way off, and then, as he held
out his friendly old hand to me, had sat down on the edge of his bed.
â€œwhat is it,â€ i asked, â€œthat you think of?â€

â€œwhat in the world, my dear, but you?â€

â€œah, the pride i take in your appreciation doesnâ€™t insist on that! i had
so far rather you slept.â€

â€œwell, i think also, you know, of this queer business of ours.â€

i marked the coolness of his firm little hand. â€œof what queer business,
miles?â€

â€œwhy, the way you bring me up. and all the rest!â€

i fairly held my breath a minute, and even from my glimmering taper
there was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow.
â€œwhat do you mean by all the rest?â€

â€œoh, you know, you know!â€

i could say nothing for a minute, though i felt, as i held his hand and
our eyes continued to meet, that my silence had all the air of admitting
his charge and that nothing in the whole world of reality was perhaps at

ing in his tone and the expression of his face, as i got this from
him, set my heart aching with such a pang as it had never yet known;
so unutterably touching was it to see his little brain puzzled and his
little resources taxed to play, under the spell laid on him, a part
of innocence and consistency. â€œno, never--from the hour you came back.
youâ€™ve never mentioned to me one of your masters, one of your comrades,
nor the least little thing that ever happened to you at school. never,
little miles--no, never--have you given me an inkling of anything that
may have happened there. therefore you can fancy how much iâ€™m in the
dark. until you came out, that way, this morning, you had, since the
first hour i saw you, scarce even made a reference to anything in your
previous life. you seemed so perfectly to accept the present.â€ it was
extraordinary how my absolute conviction of his secret precocity (or
whatever i might call the poison of an influence that i dared but half
to phrase) made hi

appear as accessible as an older person--imposed him almost as an
intellectual equal. â€œi thought you wanted to go on as you are.â€

it struck me that at this he just faintly colored. he gave, at any rate,
like a convalescent slightly fatigued, a languid shake of his head. â€œi
donâ€™t--i donâ€™t. i want to get away.â€

â€œyouâ€™re tired of bly?â€

â€œoh, no, i like bly.â€

â€œwell, then--?â€

â€œoh, you know what a boy wants!â€

i felt that i didnâ€™t know so well as miles, and i took temporary refuge.
â€œyou want to go to your uncle?â€

again, at this, with his sweet ironic face, he made a movement on the
pillow. â€œah, you canâ€™t get off with that!â€

i was silent a little, and it was i, now, i think, who changed color.
â€œmy dear, i donâ€™t want to get off!â€

â€œyou canâ€™t, even if you do. you canâ€™t, you canâ€™t!â€--he lay beautifully
staring. â€œmy uncle must come down, and you must completely settle
things.â€

â€œif we do,â€ i returned with some s

â€œwell, donâ€™t you understand that thatâ€™s exactly what iâ€™m working for?
youâ€™ll have to tell him--about the way youâ€™ve let it all drop: youâ€™ll
have to tell him a tremendous lot!â€

the exultation with which he uttered this helped me somehow, for the
instant, to meet him rather more. â€œand how much will you, miles, have to
tell him? there are things heâ€™ll ask you!â€

he turned it over. â€œvery likely. but what things?â€

â€œthe things youâ€™ve never told me. to make up his mind what to do with
you. he canâ€™t send you back--â€

â€œoh, i donâ€™t want to go back!â€ he broke in. â€œi want a new field.â€

he said it with admirable serenity, with positive unimpeachable
gaiety; and doubtless it was that very note that most evoked for me the
poignancy, the unnatural childish tragedy, of his probable reap

at the end of three months with all this bravado and still more
dishonor. it overwhelmed me now that i should never be able to bear
that, and it made me let myself go. i threw myself upon him and in the
tenderness of my pity i embraced him. â€œdear little miles, dear little
miles--!â€

my face was close to his, and he let me kiss him, simply taking it with
indulgent good humor. â€œwell, old lady?â€

â€œis there nothing--nothing at all that you want to tell me?â€

he turned off a little, facing round toward the wall and holding up his
hand to look at as one had seen sick children look. â€œiâ€™ve told you--i
told you this morning.â€

oh, i was sorry for him! â€œthat you just want me not to worry you?â€

he looked round at me now, as if in recognition of my understand

h it!â€

i waited a minute. â€œwhat happened before?â€

he gazed up at me again. â€œbefore what?â€

â€œbefore you came back. and before you went away.â€

for some time he was silent, but he continued to meet my eyes. â€œwhat
happened?â€

it made me, the sound of the words, in which it seemed to me that
i caught for the very first time a small faint quaver of consenting
consciousness--it made me drop on my knees beside the bed and seize
once more the chance of possessing him. â€œdear little miles, dear little
miles, if you knew how i want to help you! itâ€™s only that, itâ€™s nothing
but that, and iâ€™d rather die than give you a pain or do you a wrong--iâ€™d
rather die than hurt a hair of you. dear little milesâ€--oh, i brought it
out now even if i should go too far--â€œi just want you to help me to save
you!â€ but i knew in a moment after this that i had gone too far. the
answer to my appeal was instantaneous, but it came in the form of an
extraordinary blast and chill, a gust of fr

f, in the wild wind, the casement had crashed in. the
boy gave a loud, high shriek, which, lost in the rest of the shock of
sound, might have seemed, indistinctly, though i was so close to him,
a note either of jubilation or of terror. i jumped to my feet again and
was conscious of darkness. so for a moment we remained, while i stared
about me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirred and the window
tight. â€œwhy, the candleâ€™s out!â€ i then cried.

â€œit was i who blew it, dear!â€ said miles.

the next day, after lessons, mrs. grose found a moment to say to me
quietly: â€œhave you written, miss?â€

â€œyes--iâ€™ve written.â€ but i didnâ€™t add--for the hour--that my letter,
sealed and directed, was still in my pocket. there would be time enough
to send it before the messenger should go to the village. meanwhile
there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more
exemplary morning. it was exactly as if they had both had at heart to
gloss over any recent lit

tle friction. they performed the dizziest feats
of arithmetic, soaring quite out of my feeble range, and perpetrated,
in higher spirits than ever, geographical and historical jokes. it was
conspicuous of course in miles in particular that he appeared to wish to
show how easily he could let me down. this child, to my memory, really
lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no words can translate;
there was a distinction all his own in every impulse he revealed; never
was a small natural creature, to the uninitiated eye all frankness and
freedom, a more ingenious, a more extraordinary little gentleman. i had
perpetually to guard against the wonder of contemplation into which my
initiated view betrayed me; to

played; and if there are those who think he had better have been kicking
a football i can only say that i wholly agree with them. for at the
end of a time that under his influence i had quite ceased to measure, i
started up with a strange sense of having literally slept at my post. it
was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom fire, and yet i hadnâ€™t
really, in the least, slept: i had only done something much worse--i had
forgotten. where, all this time, was flora? when i put the question to
miles, he played on a minute before answering and then could only say:
â€œwhy, my dear, how do _i_ know?â€--breaking moreover into a happy laugh
which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment, he
prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song.

i went straight to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before
going downstairs, i looked into several others. as she was nowhere
about she would surely be with mrs. grose, whom, in the comfort of that
theory, i accordingly proceeded in qu

t a distance.â€ i had made up my mind. â€œshe has gone out.â€

mrs. grose stared. â€œwithout a hat?â€

i naturally also looked volumes. â€œisnâ€™t that woman always without one?â€

â€œsheâ€™s with her?â€

â€œsheâ€™s with her!â€ i declared. â€œwe must find them.â€

my hand was on my friendâ€™s arm, but she failed for the moment,
confronted with such an account of the matter, to respond to my
pressure. she communed, on the contrary, on the spot, with her
uneasiness. â€œand whereâ€™s master miles?â€

â€œoh, heâ€™s with quint. theyâ€™re in the schoolroom.â€

â€œlord, miss!â€ my view, i was myself aware--and therefore i suppose my
tone--had never yet reached so calm an assurance.

â€œthe trickâ€™s played,â€ i went on; â€œtheyâ€™ve successfully worked their
plan. he found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while she
went off.â€

â€œâ€˜divineâ€™?â€ mrs. grose bewilderedly echoed.

â€œinfernal, then!â€ i almost cheerfully rejoined. â€œhe has provided for
himself as well. but

e two were still before me; and the singular
reticence of our communion was even more marked in the frank look she
launched me. â€œiâ€™ll be hanged,â€ it said, â€œif _i_â€˜ll speak!â€

it was flora who, gazing all over me in candid wonder, was the first.
she was struck with our bareheaded aspect. â€œwhy, where are your things?â€

â€œwhere yours are, my dear!â€ i promptly returned.

she had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an
answer quite sufficient. â€œand whereâ€™s miles?â€ she went on.

there was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me:
these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn
blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for weeks and weeks, had
held high and full to the brim that now, even before speaking, i felt
overflow in a deluge. â€œiâ€™ll tell you if youâ€™ll tell me--â€ i heard myself
say, then heard the tremor in which it broke.

â€œwell, what?â€

mrs. groseâ€™s suspense blazed at me, but it was too la

just as in the churchyard with miles, the whole thing was upon us. much
as i had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us,
been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the childâ€™s face now
received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a
pane of glass. it added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the blow,
that mrs. grose, at the same instant, uttered over my violence--the
shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within a
few seconds, was completed by a gasp of

d then i took, back to the house, my dreary
and difficult course. when i reached the gate in the fence the boat,
to my surprise, was gone, so that i had a fresh reflection to make on
floraâ€™s extraordinary command of the situation. she passed that night,
by the most tacit, and i should add, were not the word so grotesque a
false note, the happiest of arrangements, with mrs. grose. i saw
neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous
compensation, i saw a great deal of miles. i saw--i can use no other
phrase--so much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever
been. no evening i had passed at bly had the portentous quality of
this one; in spite of which--and in spite also of the deeper depths of
consternation that had opened beneath my feet--there was literally, in
the ebbing actual, an extraordinarily sweet sadness. on reaching the
house i had never so much as looked for the boy; i had simply gone
straight to my room to change what i was wearing and to

straight to her uncle.â€

â€œonly to tell on you--?â€

â€œno, not â€˜onlyâ€™! to leave me, in addition, with my remedy.â€

she was still vague. â€œand what is your remedy?â€

â€œyour loyalty, to begin with. and then milesâ€™s.â€

she looked at me hard. â€œdo you think he--?â€

â€œwonâ€™t, if he has the chance, turn on me? yes, i venture still to think
it. at all events, i want to try. get off with his sister as soon as
possible and leave me with him alone.â€ i was amazed, myself, at the
spirit i had still in reserve, and therefore perhaps a trifle the more
disconcerted at the way in which, in spite of this fine example of it,
she hesitated. â€œthereâ€™s one thing, of course,â€ i went on: â€œthey mustnâ€™t,

honesty, i would answer for all the rest. on the point of taking leave
of her, nonetheless, i was to some extent embarrassed. â€œthereâ€™s one
thing, of course--it occurs to me--to remember. my letter, giving the
alarm, will have reached town before you.â€

i now perceived still more how she had been beating about the bush and
how weary at last it had made her. â€œyour letter wonâ€™t have got there.
your letter never went.â€

â€œwhat then became of it?â€

â€œgoodness knows! master miles--â€

â€œdo you mean he took it?â€ i gasped.

she hung fire, but she overcame her reluctance. â€œi mean that i saw
yesterday, when i came back with miss flora, that it wasnâ€™t where you
had put it. later in the evening i had the chance to question luke, and
he declared that he had neither noticed nor touched it.â€ we could only
exchange, on this, one of our deeper mutual soundings, and it was mrs.
grose who first brought up the plumb with an almost elated â€œyou see!â€

â€œyes, i see that i

â€œand donâ€™t you see anything else?â€

i faced her a moment with a sad smile. â€œit strikes me that by this time
your eyes are open even wider than mine.â€

they proved to be so indeed, but she could still blush, almost, to show
it. â€œi make out now what he must have done at school.â€ and she gave, in
her simple sharpness, an almost droll disillusioned nod. â€œhe stole!â€

i turned it over--i tried to be more judicial. â

heâ€™s saved--â€

â€œthen you are?â€ the dear woman kissed me on this, and i took her
farewell. â€œiâ€™ll save you without him!â€ she cried as she went.

yet it was when she had got off--and i missed her on the spot--that the
great pinch really came. if i had counted on what it would give me to
find myself alone with miles, i speedily perceived, at least, that it
would give me a measure. no hour of my stay in fact was so assailed
with apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage
containing mrs. grose and my younger pupil had already rolled out of the
gates. now i was, i said to myself, face to face with the elements, and
for much of the rest of the day, while i fought my weakness, i could
consider that i had been supremely rash. it was a tighter place still
than i had yet turned round in; al
 
 ___________________________
 
t all, i became, that morning, very grand and very dry. i welcomed the
consciousness that i was charged with much to do, and i caused it to be
known as well that, left thus to myself, i was quite remarkably firm. i
wandered with that manner, for the next hour or two, all over the place
and looked, i have no doubt, as if i were ready for any onset. so, for
the benefit of whom it might concern, i paraded with a sick heart.

the person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner,
little miles himself. my perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no
glimpse of him, but they had tended to make more public the change
taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the
piano, the day before, kept me, in floraâ€™s interest, so beguiled and
befooled. the stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her
confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in
by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. he had
already disappeared when, on my

that (opportunity aiding, precious opportunity which had now come) it
would be preposterous, with a child so endowed, to forego the help one
might wrest from absolute intelligence? what had his intelligence been
given him for but to save him? mightnâ€™t one, to reach his mind, risk the
stretch of an angular arm over his character? it was as if, when we were
face to face in the dining room, he had literally shown me the way.
the roast mutton was on the table, and i had dispensed with attendance.
miles, before he sat down, stood a moment with his hands in his pockets
and looked at the joint, on which he seemed on the point of passing some
humorous judgment. but what he presently produced was: â€œi say, my dear,
is she really very awfully ill?â€

â€œlittle flora? not so bad but that sheâ€™ll presently be better. london
will set her up. bly had ceased to agree with her. come here and take
your mutton.â€

he alertly obeyed me, carried the plate carefully to his seat, and,
when he was establish

ed, went on. â€œdid bly disagree with her so terribly
suddenly?â€

â€œnot so suddenly as you might think. one had seen it coming on.â€

â€œthen why didnâ€™t you get her off before?â€

â€œbefore what?â€

â€œbefore she became too ill to travel.â€

i found myself prompt. â€œsheâ€™s not too ill to travel: she only might
have become so if she had stayed. this was just the moment to seize. the
journey will dissipate the influenceâ€--oh, i was grand!--â€œand carry it
off.â€

â€œi see, i seeâ€--miles, for that matter, was grand, too. he settled to
his repast with the charming little â€œtable mannerâ€ that, from the day of
his arrival, had relieved me of all grossness of admonition. whatever
he had been driven from school for, it was not for ugly feeding. he
was irreproachable, as always, today; but he was unmistakably more
conscious. he was discernibly trying to take for granted more things
than he found, without assistance, quite easy; and he dropped into
peaceful silence while he felt hi

s situation. our meal was of the
briefest--mine a vain pretense, and i had the things immediately
removed. while this was done miles stood again with his hands in his
little pockets and his back to me--stood and looked out of the wide
window through which, that other day, i had seen what pulled me up. we
continued silent while the maid was with us--as silent, it whimsically
occurred to me, as some young couple who, on their wedding journey, at
the inn, feel shy in the presence of the waiter. he turned round only
when the waiter had left us. â€œwell--so weâ€™re alone!â€

â€œoh, more or less.â€ i fancy my smile wa

ile in his
usual sweet little manner he sat at table, had needed all his small
strange genius to give it a gloss. when he at last turned round to meet
me, it was almost as if this genius had succumbed. â€œwell, i think iâ€™m
glad bly agrees with me!â€

â€œyou would certainly seem to have seen, these twenty-four hours, a good
deal more of it than for some time before. i hope,â€ i went on bravely,
â€œthat youâ€™ve been enjoying yourself.â€

â€œoh, yes, iâ€™ve been ever so far; all round about--miles and miles away.
iâ€™ve never been so free.â€

he had really a manner of his own, and i could only try to keep up with
him. â€œwell, do you like it?â€

he stood there smiling; then at last he put into two words--â€œdo
you?â€--more discrimination than i had ever heard two words contain.
before i had time to deal with that, however, he continued as if with
the sense that this was an impertinence to be softened. â€œnothing could
be more charming than the way you take it, for of course if weâ€™re

 intercourse? wasnâ€™t it base to create for a
being so exquisite a mere alien awkwardness? i suppose i now read into
our situation a clearness it couldnâ€™t have had at the time, for i seem
to see our poor eyes already lighted with some spark of a prevision
of the anguish that was to come. so we circled about, with terrors and
scruples, like fighters not daring to close. but it was for each other
we feared! that kept us a little longer suspended and unbruised. â€œiâ€™ll
tell you everything,â€ miles said--â€œi mean iâ€™ll tell you anything you
like. youâ€™ll stay on with me, and we shall both be all right, and i will
tell you--i will. but not now.â€

â€œwhy not now?â€

my insistence turned him from me and kept him once more at his window
in a silence during which, between us, you might have heard a pin drop.
then he was before me again with the air of a person for whom, outside,
someone who had frankly to be reckoned with was waiting. â€œi have to see
luke.â€

i had not yet reduced him

oo much to let it through, i had to shade, as it were,
my flame. meanwhile the glare of the face was again at the window, the
scoundrel fixed as if to watch and wait. it was the very confidence that
i might now defy him, as well as the positive certitude, by this time,
of the childâ€™s unconsciousness, that made me go on. â€œwhat did you take
it for?â€

â€œto see what you said about me.â€

â€œyou opened the letter?â€

â€œi opened it.â€

my eyes were now, as i held him off a little again, on milesâ€™s own face,
in which the collapse of mockery showed me how complete was the ravage
of uneasiness. what was prodigious was that at last, by my success, his
sense was sealed and his communication stopped: he knew that he was in
presence, but knew not of what, and knew still less that i also was and
that i did know. and what did this strain of trouble matter when my eyes
went back to the window only to see that the air was clear again and--by
my personal triumph--the influence quenched? there wa

 of my hair as well as wonder if it
were more strange to put to a gentleman such a question or to see him
take it with allowances that gave the very distance of his fall in the
world. â€œwas it for that you mightnâ€™t go back?â€

the only thing he felt was rather a dreary little surprise. â€œdid you
know i mightnâ€™t go back?â€

â€œi know everything.â€

he gave me at this the longest and strangest look. â€œeverything?â€

â€œeverything. therefore did you--?â€ but i couldnâ€™t say it again.

miles could, very simply. â€œno. i didnâ€™t steal.â€

my face must have shown him i believed him utterly; yet my hands--but it
was for pure tenderness--shook him as if to ask him why, if it was all
for nothing, he had condemned me to months of torment. â€œwhat then did
you do?â€

he looked in vague pain all round the top of the room and drew his
breath, two or three times over, as if with difficulty. he might have
been standing at the bottom of the sea and raising his eyes to some
faint green twili

ory and all the return of my battle, so that
the wildness of my veritable leap only served as a great betrayal. i
saw him, from the midst of my act, meet it with a divination, and on the
perception that even now he only guessed, and that the window was still
to his own eyes free, i let the impulse flame up to convert the climax
of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation. â€œno more, no
more, no more!â€ i shrieked, as i tried to press him against me, to my
visitant.

â€œis she here?â€ miles panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the
direction of my words. then as his strange â€œsheâ€ staggered me and, with
a gasp, i echoed it, â€œmiss jessel, miss jessel!â€ he with a sudden fury
gave me back.

i seized, stupefied, his supposition--some sequel to what we had done to
flora, but this made me only want to show him that it was better still
than that. â€œitâ€™s not miss jessel! but itâ€™s at the window--straight
before us. itâ€™s there--the coward horror, there for the last time!â€

my proof that i flashed into ice to
challenge him. â€œwhom do you mean by â€˜heâ€™?â€

â€œpeter quint--you devil!â€ his face gave again, round the room, its
convulsed supplication. â€œwhere?â€

they are in my ears still, his supreme surrender of the name and his
tribute to my devotion. â€œwhat does he matter now, my own?--what will he
ever matter? _i_ have you,â€ i launched at the beast, â€œbut he has lost
you forever!â€ then, for the demonstration of my work, â€œthere, there!â€ i
said to miles.

but he had already jerked straight round, stared, glared again, and
seen but the quiet day. with the stroke of the loss i was so proud of he
uttered the cry of a creature hurled over an abyss, and the grasp with
which i recovered him might have been that of catching him in his fall.
i caught him, yes, i held him--it may be imagined with what a passion;
but at the end of a minute i began to feel what it truly was that
i held. we were alone with the quiet day, and his little heart,
dispossessed
