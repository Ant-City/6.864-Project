     bigwig, as he had predicted, was getting his head bitten off.

enjoying a quiet time.... am i waiting until i become a little older?

     "but, hazel, you didn't really think the chief rabbit would act on your advice,
did you? what were you expecting?"
     it was evening once more and hazel and fiver were feeding outside the wood
with two friends. blackberry, the rabbit with tipped ears who had been startled by
fiver the night before, had listened carefully to hazel's description of the notice
board, remarking that he had always felt sure that men left these things about to
act as signs or messages of some kind, in the same way that rabbits left marks on
runs and gaps. it was another neighbor, dandelion, who had now brought the
talk back to the threarah and his indifference to fiver's fear.
     "i don't know what i expected," said hazel. "i'd neve

r been near the chief
rabbit before. but i thought, 'well, even if he won't listen, at least no one can say
afterward that we didn't do our best to warn him.'"
     "you're sure, then, that there's really something to be afraid of?"
     "i'm quite certain. i've always known fiver, you see."
     blackberry was about to reply when another rabbit came noisily through the
thick dog's mercury in the wood, blundered down into the brambles and pushed
his way up from the ditch. it was bigwig.
     "hello, bigwig," said hazel. "you're off duty?"
     "off duty" said bigwig, "and likely to remain off duty."
     "how do you mean?"
     "i've left the owsla, that's what i mean."
     "not on our account?"
     "you could say that. the threarah's rather good at making himself unpleasant
when he's been woken

     "oh, that's you, fiver, is it?" said bigwig, noticing him for the first time. "good,
i was coming to look for you. i've been thinking about what you said to the chief
rabbit. tell me, is it a sort of tremendous hoax to make yourself important, or is
it true?"
     "it is true," said fiver. "i wish it weren't."
     "then you'll be leaving the warren?"
     they were all startled by the bluntness with which bigwig went to the point.
dandelion muttered, "leave the warren, frithrah!" while blackberry twitched his
ears and looked very intently, first at bigwig and then at hazel.
     it was hazel who replied. "fiver and i will be leaving the warren tonight," he
said deliberately. "i don't know exactly where we shall go, but we'll take anyone
who's ready to come with us."
     "right," said bigwig, "then you can take me."
     the last thing hazel had expected was the immediate support of a member of
the owsla. it crossed his mind that although bigwig would certainly be a useful
rabbit in a t

ight corner, he would also be a difficult one to get on with. he
certainly would not want to do what he was told -- or even asked -- by an
outskirter. "i don't care if he is in the owsla," thought hazel. "if we get away from
the warren, i'm not going to let bigwig run everything, or why bother to go?" but
he answered only, "good. we shall be glad to have you."
     he looked round at the other rabbits, who were all staring either at bigwig or
at himself. it was blackberry who spoke next.
     "i think i'll come," he said. "i don't quite know whether it's you who've
persuaded me, fiver. but anyway, there are too many bucks in this warren, and
it's pretty poor fun for any rabbit that's not in the owsla. the funny thing is that
you feel terrified to stay and i feel terrified to go. foxes here, weasels there, fiver
in the middle, begone dull care!"
     he pulled out a burnet leaf and ate it slowly, concealing his fear as best he
could; for all his instincts were wa

it put the wind up me, to tell you the truth, so i've just brought hawkbit along
and left it at that."
     "i don't blame you," said hazel. "knowing toadflax, i'm surprised he didn't
knock you over first and ask questions afterward. all the same, let's wait a little
longer. blackberry ought to be here soon."
     time passed. they crouched in silence while the moon shadows moved
northward in the grass. at last, just as hazel was about to run down the slope to
blackberry's burrow, he saw him come out of his hole, followed by no less than
three rabbits. one of these, buckthorn, hazel knew well. he was glad to see him,
for he knew him for a tough, sturdy fellow who was considered certain to get into
the owsla as soon as he reached full weight.
     "but i dare say he's impatien

t," thought hazel, "or he may have come off worst
in some scuffle over a doe and taken it hard. well, with him and bigwig, at least
we shan't be too badly off if we run into any fighting."
     he did not recognize the other two rabbits and when blackberry told him their
names -- speedwell and acorn -- he was none the wiser. but this was not
surprising, for they were typical outskirters -- thin-looking six-monthers, with the
strained, wary look of those who are only too well used to the thin end of the
stick. they looked curiously at fiver. from what blackberry had told them, they
had been almost expecting to find fiver foretelling doom in a poetic torrent.
instead, he seemed more calm and normal than the rest. the certainty of going
had lifted a

 weight from fiver.
     more time went slowly by. blackberry scrambled up into the fern and then
returned to the top of the bank, fidgeting nervously and half inclined to bolt at
nothing. hazel and fiver remained in the ditch, nibbling halfheartedly at the dark
grass. at last hazel heard what he was listening for; a rabbit -- or was it two? --
approaching from the wood.
     a few moments later bigwig was in the ditch. behind him came a hefty, brisk-
looking rabbit something over twelve months old. he was well known by sight to
all the warren, for his fu

t them in the owsla. they're not really
dangerous. they can't catch a rabbit that runs, and nearly always you can smell
them coming. they're funny things: i've heard of rabbits living almost on top of
them and coming to no harm. but they're best avoided, all the same. they'll dig
out rabbit kittens and they'll kill an injured rabbit if they find one. they're one of
the thousand, all right. i ought to have guessed from the smell, but it was new to
me."
     "it had killed before it met us," said blackberry with a shudder. "i saw the
blood on its lips."
     "a rat, perhaps, or pheasant chicks. lucky for us it had killed, otherwise it
might have been quicker. still, fortunately we did the right thing. we really came
out of it very well," said bigwig.
     fiver came limping down the path with pipkin. they, too, checked and stared
at the sight of the river.
     "what do you think we ought to do now, fiver?" asked hazel.
     fiver looked down at the water and twitched his ears.
     "we shall have

they're not going to fancy, unless something frightens them into it."
     as soon as they had made their way back, bigwig came across to them from the
bushes at the edge of the path.
     "i was wondering where you'd got to," he said to hazel. "are you ready to move
on?"
     "no, i'm not," answered hazel firmly. "i think we ought to stay here until ni-

frith. that'll give everyone a chance to rest and then we can swim across to those
fields."
     bigwig was about to reply, but blackberry spoke first.
     "bigwig," he said, "why don't you swim over now, and then go out into the field
and have a look round? the wood may not stretch very far one way or the other.
you could see from there; and then we might know which would be the best way
to go."
     "oh, well," said bigwig rather grudgingly, "i suppose there's some sense in
that. i'll swim the embleer* river as many times as you like. always glad to
oblige."
     without the slightest hesitation, he took two hops to the water,

 the dog crossing a clearing. it was trailing a chain, so it
must have broken loose. it may be on the lendri's scent, but the lendri will be
underground by now. what do you think will happen when it picks up our scent,
running from one side of the wood to the other, with dew on it? come on, let's get
over quickly,"
     hazel felt at a loss. in front of him stood bigwig, sodden wet, undaunted,
single-minded -- the very picture of decision. at his shoulder was fiver, silent and
twitching. he saw blackberry watching him intently, waiting for his lead and
disregarding bigwig's. then he looked at pipkin, huddled into a fold of sand,
more panic-stricken and helpless than any rabbit he had ever seen. at this
moment, up in the wood, there broke out an excited yelping and a jay began to
scold.
     hazel spoke through a kind of light-headed trance. "well, you'd better get on,
then," he said, "and anyone else who wants to. personally, i'm going to wait until
fiver and pipkin are fit to tackle it."

others will have to stay here and hope for the best. the dog may not come."
     "i'm afraid that won't do for me. i got pipkin into this and i'm going to get him
out."
     "well, you didn't get fiver into it, did you? he got you into it."
     hazel could not help noticing, with reluctant admiration, that although bigwig
had lost his temper, he was apparently in no hurry on his own account and
seemed less frightened than any of them. looking round for blackberry, he saw
that he had left them and was up at the top of the pool, where the narrow beach
tailed away into a gravel spit. his paws were half buried in the wet gravel and he
was nosing at something large and flat on the waterline. it looked like a piece of
wood.
     "blackberry," he said, "can you come back here a moment?"
     blackberry looked up, tugged out his paws and ran back.
     "hazel," he said quickly, "that's a piece of flat wood -- like that piece that closed
the gap by the green loo

se above the warren -- you remember? it must have
drifted down the river. so it floats. we could put fiver and pipkin on it and make
it float again. it might go across the river. can you understand?"
     hazel had no idea what he meant. blackberry's flood of apparent nonsense
only seemed to draw tighter the mesh of danger and bewilderment. as though
bigwig's angry impatience, pipkin's terror and the approaching dog were not
enough to contend with, the cleverest rabbit among them had evidently gone out
of his mind. he felt close to despair.
     "frithrah, yes, i see!" said an excited voice at his ear. it was fiver. "quick,
hazel, don't wait! come on, and bring pipkin!"
     it was blackberry who bullied the stupefied pipkin to his feet a

nd forced him to
limp the few yards to the gravel spit. the piece of wood, hardly bigger than a large
rhubarb leaf, was lightly aground. blackberry almost drove pipkin onto it with his
claws. pipkin crouched shivering and fiver followed him aboard.
     "who's strong?" said blackberry. "bigwig! silver! push it out!"
     no one obeyed him. all squatted, puzzled and uncertain. blackberry buried his
nose in the gravel under the landward edge of the board and raised it, pushing.
the board tipped. pipkin squealed and fiver lowered his head and splayed his
claws. then the board righted itself and drifted out a few feet into the pool with
the two rabbits hunched upon it, rigid and motionless. it rotated slowly and they
found themselves staring back at their comrades.
     "frith and inlé!" said dandelion. "they're sitting on the water! why don't they
sink?"
     "they're sitting on

 the wood and the wood floats, can't you see?" said
blackberry. "now we swim over ourselves. can we start, hazel?"
     during the last few minutes hazel had been as near to losing his head as he
was ever to come. he had been at his wits' end, with no reply to bigwig's scornful
impatience except his readiness to risk his own life in company with fiver and
pipkin. he still could not understand what had happened, but at least he realized
that blackberry wanted him to show authority. his head cleared.
     "swim," he said. "everybody swim."
     he watched them as they went in. dandelion swam as well as he ran, swiftly
and easily. silver, too, was strong. the others paddled and scrambled over

somehow, and as they began to reach the other side, hazel plunged. the cold
water penetrated his fur almost at once. his breath came short and as his head
went under he could hear a faint grating of gravel along the bottom. he paddled

as he pulled himself out, he looked round among the sopping rabbits in the
alders.
     "where's bigwig?" he asked.
     "behind you," answered blackberry, his teeth chattering.
     bigwig was still in the water, on the other side of the pool. he had swum to the
raft, put his head against it and was pushing it forward with heavy thrusts of his
back legs. "keep still," hazel heard him say in a quick, gulping voice. then he
sank. but a moment later he was up again and had thrust his head over the back
of the board. as he kicked and struggled, it tilted and then, while the rabbits
watched from the bank, moved slowly across the pool and grounded on

the
opposite side. fiver pushed pipkin onto the stones and bigwig waded out beside
them, shivering and breathless.
     "i got the idea once blackberry had shown us," he said. "but it's hard to push it
when you're in the water. i hope it's not long to sunrise. i'm cold. let's get on."
     there was no sign of the dog as they made haste through the alders and up the
field to the first hedgerow. most of them had not understood blackberry's
discovery of the raft and at once forgot it. fiver, however, came over to where
blackberry was lying against the stem of a blackthorn in the hedge.
     "you saved pipkin and me, didn't you?" he said. "i don't think pipkin's got any
idea what really happened; but i have."
     "i admit it was a good idea," replied blackberry. "let's remember it. it might
come in handy again sometime."

 and silver watched tensely. the car
appeared, flashing green and white, and raced down toward bigwig. for an
instant it filled the whole world with noise and fear. then it was gone and
bigwig's fur was blowing in the whack of wind that followed it down the hedges.
he jumped back up the bank among the staring rabbits.
     "see? they don't hurt you," said bigwig. "as a matter of fact, i don't think
they're alive at all. but i must admit i can't altogether make it out."
     as on the riverbank, blackberry had moved away and was already down on the
road on his own account, sniffing out toward the middle, halfway between hazel
and the bend. they saw him start and jump back to the shelter of the bank.
     "what is it?" said hazel.
     blackberry did not answer, and hazel and bigwig hopped toward him along
the verge. he was opening and shutting his mouth and licking his lips, much as a
cat does when something disgusts it.
     "you say they're not dangerous, bigwig," he said quietly. "but i think

they must
be, for all that."
     in the middle of the road was a flattened, bloody mass of brown prickles and
white fur, with small black feet and snout crushed round the edges. the flies
crawled upon it, and here and there the sharp points of gravel pressed up through
the flesh.
     "a yona," said blackberry. "what harm does a yona do to anything but slugs
and beetles? and what can eat a yona?"
     "it must have come at night," said bigwig.
     "yes, of course. the yonil always hunt by night. if you see them by day, they're
dying."
     "i know. but what i'm trying to explain is that at night the hrududil have great
lights, brighter than frith himself. they draw creatures toward them, and if they
shine on you, you can't see or think which way to go. then the hrududu is quite
likely to crush you.

what there is in front of us."
     "look here," said hazel, "suppose you tell me what you want to do and i'll tell
you what i think about it."
     "we want to go back," said acorn. "we think fiver was wrong."
     "how can you go back through all we've come through?" replied hazel. "and
probably get killed for wounding an owsla officer, if you ever do get back? talk
sense, for frith's sake."
     "it wasn't we who wounded holly," said speedwell.
     "you were there and blackberry brought you there. do you think they won't

remember that? besides--"
     hazel stopped as fiver approached, followed by bigwig.
     "hazel," said fiver, "could you come up on the bank with me for a few
moments? it's important."
     "and while you're there," said bigwig, scowling round at the others from under
the great sheaf of fur on his head, "i'll just have a few words with these three.
why don't you get washed, hawkbit? you look like the end of a rat's tail left in a

     when hazel and fiver reached the floor of the hollow they found blackberry
wailing for them, crouching on the peat and nibbling at a few brown stalks of
sedge grass.
     "hello," said hazel. "what's happened? where are the others?"
     "over there," answered blackberry. "there's been a fearful row. bigwig told
hawkbit and speedwell that he'd scratch them to pieces if they didn't obey him.
and when hawkbit said he wanted to know who was chief rabbit, bigwig bit
him. it seems a nasty business. who is chief rabbit, anyway -- you or bigwig?"

 could see that a little way ahead there was
an open track of bare gravel. he limped out of the heather, sat on the stones and

shook the wet from his fur. he could see fiver's hills plainly now, greenish-gray
and seeming close in the rain-laden air. he could even pick out the dots of furze
bushes and stunted yew trees on the steep slopes. as he gazed at them, he heard
an excited voice further down the track.
     "he's done it! didn't i tell you he'd do it?"
     hazel turned his head and saw blackberry on the path. he was bedraggled and
exhausted, but it was he who was speaking. out of the heather behind him came
acorn, speedwell and buckthorn. all four rabbits were now staring straight at
him. he wondered why. then, as they approached, he realized that they were
looking not at him, but past him at something further off. he turned round. the
gravel track led downhill into a narrow belt of silver birch and rowan. beyond was
a thin hedge; and beyond that, a green field between two copses. they

     "oh, hazel," said blackberry, coming up to him round a puddle in the gravel. "i

you were going. i could hear you in the heather, saying 'not far now' and it was
annoying me. i thought you were making it up. i should have known better.

     "well done, hazel!" said buckthorn. "well done!"
     hazel did not know what to reply. he looked at them in silence and it was
acorn who spoke next.
     "come on!"

st that the home warren

tell you what seems the right thing to me. let's go back a little way, between the
woods, and have a scratch near that oak tree there -- just by that white patch of
stitchwort. i know the farm's a long way off, but there's no point in being nearer
to it than we need. and if we're fairly close to the wood opposite, the trees will
help to break the wind a bit in winter."
     "splendid," said blackberry. "it's going to cloud over, do you see? rain before
sunset and we'll be in shelter. well, let's make a start. oh, look! there's bigwig
coming back along the bottom, and the other two with him."
     the three rabbits were returning down the bank of the stream and had not yet
seen hazel and the others. they passed below them, into the narrower part of the
field between the two copses, and it was not until acorn had been sent halfway
down the slope to attract their attention that they turned and

now staring intently
across the field.
     beside a tussock of grass a little way outside the opposite copse, a rabbit was
sitting and gazing at them. its ears were erect and it was evidently giving them the
full attention of sight, smell and hearing. hazel rose on his hind legs, paused, and
then sat back on his haunches, in full view. the other rabbit remained motionless.
hazel, never taking his eyes off it, heard three or four of the others coming up
behind him. after a moment he said,
     "blackberry?"
     "he's down the hole," replied pipkin.
     "go and get him."
     still the strange rabbit made no move. the wind rose and the long grass began
to flutter and ripple in the dip between them. from behind, blackberry said,
     "you wanted me, hazel?"
     "i'm going over to speak to that rabbit," said hazel. "i want you to come with
me."
     "can i come?" asked pipkin.
     "no, hlao-roo. we don't want to frighten him. three's too many."
     "be careful," said buckthorn, as hazel and bl

we can always run."
     as they approached, the other rabbit kept still and watched them intently.
they could see now that he was a big fellow, sleek and handsome. his fur shone
and his claws and teeth were in perfect condition. nevertheless, he did not seem
aggressive. on the contrary, there was a curious, rather unnatural gentleness
about the way in which he waited for them to come nearer. they stopped and

looked at him from a little distance.
     "i don't think he's dangerous," whispered blackberry. "i'll go up to him first if
you like."
     "we'll both go," replied hazel. but at this moment the other rabbit came
toward them of his own accord. he and hazel touched their noses together,
sniffing and questioning silently. the stranger had an unusual smell, but it was
certainly not unpleasant. it gave hazel an impression of good feeding, of health
and of a certain indolence, as though the other came from some rich, prosperous
country where he himself had never been. he had the air of an ari

stocrat and as
he turned to gaze at blackberry from his great brown eyes, hazel began to see
himself as a ragged wanderer, leader of a gang of vagabonds. he had not meant to
be the first to speak, but something in the other's silence compelled him.
     "we've come over the heather," he said.
     the other rabbit made no reply, but his look was not that of an enemy. his
demeanor had a kind of melancholy which was perplexing.
     "do you live here?" asked hazel, after a pause.
     "yes," replied the other rabbit; and then added, "we saw y

f there was some
kind of trick, he had no idea what it might be. he decided that he himself, at any
rate, would be perfectly candid and plain.
     "there are enough of us to protect ourselves," he said. "we don't want to make
enemies, but if we meet with any kind of interference--"
     the other interrupted smoothly. "don't get upset -- you're all very welcome. if
you're going back now, i'll come over with you; that is, unless you have any
objection."
     he set off down the slope. hazel and blackberry, after looking at each other for
a moment, caught him up and went beside him. he moved easily, without haste
and showed less caution than they in crossing the field. hazel felt more mystified
than ever. the other rabbit evidently had no fear that they might set upon him,
hrair to one, and kill him. he was ready to go alone among a crowd of suspicious
strangers, but what he stood to gain from this risk it was impossible to guess.
perhaps, thought hazel wryly, teeth and claws would make no impres

sion on that
great, firm body and shining pelt.
     when they reached the ditch, all the other rabbits were squatting together,
watching their approach. hazel stopped in front of them but did not know what
to say. if the stranger had not been there, he would have given them an account of

what had happened. if blackberry and he had driven the stranger across the field
by force, he could have handed him over for safekeeping to bigwig or silver. but
to have him sitting beside him, looking his followers over in silence and
courteously waiting for someone else to speak first -- this was a situation beyond
hazel's experience. it was bigwig, straightforward and blunt as always, who broke
the tension.
     "who is this, hazel?" he said. "why has he come back with you?"
     "i don't know," answered hazel, trying to lo

ars.
     "fine, big fellow, isn't he?" said buckthorn. "he doesn't look as though he had
much to bother about, living here."
     "what should we do, hazel, do you think?" asked silver. "it's true what he said,
isn't it? these scrapes -- well, we can crouch in them out of the weather, but no
more than that. and as we can't all get into one, we shall have to split up."
     "we'll join them together," said hazel, "and while we're doing that i'd like to
talk about what he said. fiver, bigwig and blackberry, can you come with me?
the rest of you split how you like."
     the new hole was short, narrow and rough. there was no room for two rabbits
to pass. four were like beans in a pod. for the first time, hazel began to realize
how much they had left behind. the holes and tunnels of an old warren become
smooth, reassuring and comfortable with use. there are no snags or rough
corners. every length smells of rabbit -- of that great, indestructible flood of
rabbitry in which each one is carried along,

rejoined the others. the pattering and whispering of the rain sounded
softly but distinctly outside. the fields and woods were shut in under it, emptied
and subdued. the insect life of the leaves and grass was stilled. the thrush should
have been singing, but hazel could hear no thrush. he and his companions were a
muddy handful of scratchers, crouching in a narrow, drafty pit in lonely country.
they were not out of the weather. they were waiting, uncomfortably, for the
weather to change.
     "blackberry," said hazel, "what did you think of our visitor and how would you
like to go to his warren?"
     "well," replied blackberry, "what i think is this. there's no way of finding out

whether he's to be trusted except to try it. he seemed friendly. but then, if a lot of
rabbits were afraid of some newcomers and wanted to deceive them -- get them
down a hole and attack them -- they'd start -- wouldn't they? -- by sending
someone who was plausible. they might want to kill us. but then again, as he

this. we haven't slept since yesterday afternoon."
     "fiver?"
     "i think we ought to have nothing to do with that rabbit or his warren. we
ought to leave this place at once. but what's the good of talking?"
     cold and damp, hazel felt impatient. he had always been accustomed to rely
on fiver and now, when he really needed him, he was letting them down.
blackberry's reasoning had been first-rate and bigwig had at least shown which
way any sound-hearted rabbit would be likely to lean. apparently the only
contribution fiver could make was this beetle-spirited vaporing. he tried to
remember that fiver was undersized and that they had had an anxious time and
were all weary. at this moment the soil at the far end of the burrow began to
crumble inward, then it fell away and silver's head and front paws appeared.
     "here we are," said silver cheerfully. "we'

ourselves, and report back?"
     "no," said silver. "let's all go. if we're going at all, for frith's sake let's do it as
though we weren't afraid. what do you say, dandelion?"
     "i think you're right."
     "then we'll go now," said hazel. "get the others and follow me."

into his eyes and under his scut, he watched them as they joined him. blackberry,
alert and intelligent, looking first up and then down the ditch before he crossed it.

way into the field before stopping to wait for the rest. buckthorn, perhaps the
most sensible and staunch of them all. pipkin, who looked round for hazel and

e bracken, under the fence and into the field. in the bank on the further
side of the bay the rabbit holes were plain to see, showing dark and distinct in the
bare ground. it was as conspicuous a warren as could well be imagined.
     "sky above us!" said bigwig. "every living creature for miles must know that's
there! look at all the tracks in the grass, too! do you think they sing in the
morning, like the thrushes?"
     "perhaps they're too secure to bother about concealing themselves," said
blackberry. "after all, the home warren was fairly plain to be seen."
     "yes, but not like that! a couple of hrududil could go down some of those
holes."
     "so could i," said dandelion. "i'm getting dreadfully wet."

     as they approached, a big rabbit appeared over the edge of the ditch, looked at
them quickly and vanished into the bank. a few moments later two others came
out and waited for them. they, too, were sleek and unusually large.

never seen a laburnum and was

puzzled by the name, which in lapine is "poison tree." how could a rabbit be
called poison? and how could stones be el-ahrairah? what, exactly, was it that
strawberry was saying was el-ahrairah? in confusion he said, "i don't
understand."
     "it's what we call a shape," explained strawberry. "haven't you seen one
before? the stones make the shape of el-ahrairah on the wall. stealing the king's
lettuce. you know?"
     hazel had not felt so much bewildered since blackberry had talked about the
raft beside the enborne. obviously, the stones could not possibly be anything to
do with el-ahrairah. it seemed to him that strawberry might as well have said
that his tail was an oak tree. he sniffed again and then put a paw up to the wall.
     "steady, steady," said strawberry. "you might damage it and that wouldn't do.
never mind. we'll come again some other time."
     "but where are--" hazel was beginning, when strawberry once more
interrupted him.
     "i expect you'

 as the well pit and the el-ahrairah of laburnum.
     "yes, we did," said hazel. "it's something quite strange to me, i'm afraid. but
i'd rather admire you and your friends than stones on a wall."
     as he said this, he noticed that cowslip had joined them and that strawberry
was talking to him quietly. he caught the words "never been near a shape" and a
moment later cowslip replied, "well, it makes no difference from our point of
view."
     hazel suddenly felt tired and depressed. he heard blackberry behind cowslip's
sleek, heavy shoulder and went across to him.
     "come out into the grass," he said quietly. "bring anyone else who'll come."
     at that moment cowslip turned to him and said, "you'll be glad of something
to eat now. i'll show you what we've got down here."
     "one or two of us are just going to silflay,"* said hazel.
     "oh, it's still raining much too hard for that," said cowslip, as though there
could be no two ways about it. "we'll feed you here."
     "i should be 
 
 ___________________________
 
sorry to quarrel over it," said hazel firmly, "but some of us need to
silflay. we're used to it, and rain doesn't bother us."
     cowslip seemed taken aback for a moment then he laughed.
     the phenomenon of laughter is unknown to animals; though it is possible that
dogs and elephants may have some inkling of it. the effect on hazel and
blackberry was overwhelming. hazel's first idea was that cowslip was showing
the symptom of some kind of disease. blackberry clearly thought that he might be
going to attack them and backed away. cowslip said nothing, but his eerie
laughter continued. hazel and blackberry turned and scuttled up the nearest run
as though he had been a ferret. halfway up they met pipkin, who was small
enough first to let them pass and then to turn round and follow them.
     the rain was still falling steadily. the night was dark and, for may, cold. they
all three hunched themselves in the grass and nibbled while the rain ran off their

fur in streams.
     "my goodness, hazel," said blackberry, "did you really want to silflay? this is
terrible! i was just going to eat whatever it is they have and then go to sleep.
what's the idea?"
     "i don't know," replied hazel. "i suddenly felt i had to get out and i wanted
your company. i can see what's troubling fiver; though he'll get over it, i dare say.
there is something strange about these rabbits. do you know they push stones
into the wall?"
     "they do what?"
     hazel explained. blackberry was as much at a loss as he had been himse

ery nice and kind," answered pipkin, "but i'll tell you how they strike
me. they all seem terribly sad. i can't think why, when they're so big and strong
and have this beautiful warren. but they put me in mind of trees in november. i

expect i'm being silly, though, hazel. you brought us here and i'm sure it must be
a fine, safe place."
     "no, you're not being silly. i hadn't realized it, but you're perfectly right. they
all seem to have something on their minds."
     "but after all," said blackberry, "we don't know why they're so few. they don't
fill the warren, anything like. perhaps they've had some sort of trouble that's left
them sad."
     "we don't know because they don't tell us. but if we're going to stay here we've
got to learn to get on with them. we can't fight them: they're too big. and we
don't want them fighting us."
     "i don't believe they can fight, hazel," said pipkin. "although they're so big,
they don't seem like fighters to me. not like bigwig and silver."
     "you

notice a lot, don't you, hlao-roo?" said hazel. "do you notice it's raining
harder than ever? i've got enough grass in my stomach for a bit. we'll go down
again now, but let's keep to ourselves for a while."
     "why not sleep?" said blackberry. "it's over a night and a day now and i'm
dropping."
     they returned down a different hole and soon found a dry, empty burrow,
where they curled up together and slept in the warmth of their own tired bodies.
     when hazel woke he perceived at once that it was morning -- some time after
sunrise, by the smell of it. the scent of apple blossom was plain enough. then he
picked up the fainter smells of buttercups and horses. mingled with these came
another. although it made him uneasy, he could

awberry's attention while he himself was getting acquainted with
nildro-hain.
     pipkin stirred and turned in his sleep, murmuring, "sayn lay narn, marli?" ("is
groundsel nice, mother?") and hazel, touched to think that he must be dreaming
of old days, rolled over on his side to give him room to settle again. at that
moment, however, he heard a rabbit approaching down some run close by.
whoever it was, he was calling -- and stamping as well, hazel noticed -- in an
unnatural way. the sound, as blackberry had said, was not unlike birdsong. as he
came closer, hazel could distinguish the word.
     "flayrah! flayrah!"
     the voice was strawberry's. pipkin and blackberry were waking, more at the
stamping than the voice, which was thin and novel, not striking through their
sleep to any deep instinct. hazel slipped out of the burrow into the run and at
once came upon strawberry busily thumping a hind leg on the hard earth floor.

but after a time cowslip came up to him from the other end of the hall.
     "i'm glad you're here, hazel," he said. "some of our lot are suggesting a story
from somebody. we're hoping one of your people would like to tell one, but we
can begin ourselves, if you'd prefer."
     there is a rabbit saying, "in the warren, more stories than passages"; and a
rabbit can no more refuse to tell a story than an irishman can refuse to fight.
hazel and his friends conferred. after a short time blackberry announced, "we've
asked hazel to tell you about our adventures: how we made our journey here and
had the good luck to join you."
     there was an uncomfortable silence, broken only by shuffling and whispering.
blackberry, dismayed, turned back to hazel and bigwig.
     "what's the matter?" he asked in a low voice. "surely there's no harm in that?"
     "wait," replied hazel quietly. "let them tell us if they don't like it. they have
their own ways here."
     however, the silence continued for

 some time, as though the other rabbits did
not care to mention what they thought was wrong.
     "it's no good," said blackberry at last. "you'll have to say something yourself,
hazel. no, why should you? i'll do it." he spoke up again. "on second thoughts,
hazel remembers that we have a good storyteller among us. dandelion will tell
you a story of el-ahrairah. that can't go wrong, anyway," he whispered.
     "which one, though?" said dandelion.
     hazel remembered the stones by the well pit. "the king's lettuce," he
answered. "they think a lot of that, i believe."
     dandelion took up his cue with the same plucky re

ove all, their fits of un-
rabbitlike melancholy. now, their own storyteller had shown that they were no
mere bunch of tramps. certainly, no reasonable rabbit could withhold
admiration. they waited to be told as much, but after a few moments realized
with surprise that their hosts were evidently less enthusiastic.
     "very nice," said cowslip. he seemed to be searching for something more to
say, but then repeated, "yes, very nice. an unusual tale."
     "but he must know it, surely?" muttered blackberry to hazel.
     "i always think these traditional stories retain a lot of charm," said another of
the rabbits, "especially when they're told in the real, old-fashioned spirit."

     "yes," said strawberry. "conviction, that's what it needs. you really have to
believe in el-ahrairah and prince rainbow, don't you? then all the rest follows."
     "don't say anything, bigwig," whispered hazel: for bigwig was scuffling his
paws indignantly. "you can't force them to like it if they don't. let's wai

     fiver, as he listened, had shown a mixture of intense absorption and
incredulous horror. at one and the same time he seemed to accept every word
and yet to be stricken with fear. once he drew in his breath, as though startled to
recognize his own half-known thoughts; and when the poem was ended he
seemed to be struggling to come to himself. he bared his teeth and licked his lips,
as blackberry had done before the dead hedgehog on the road.
     a rabbit in fear of an enemy will sometimes crouch stock still, either fascinated
or else trusting to its natural inconspicuousness to remain unnoticed. but then,
unless the fascination is too powerful, there comes the point when keeping still is
discarded and the rabbit, as though breaking a spell, turns in an instant to its
other resource -- flight. so it seemed to be with fiver now. suddenly he leaped up
and began to push his way violently

feebly. his ears drooped. his eyes opened unseeing and the whites showed
bloodshot as the brown irises rolled one way and the other. after a moment his
voice came thick and low, bubbling out of the bloody spume in his mouth.
     "owsla -- no good -- biting wire. peg -- got to -- dig out."
     a convulsion shook him and he scrabbled at the ground, covering himself in a
mask of wet earth and blood. then he was still again.
     "run, fiver, run to the warren," cried hazel. "get the others -- blackberry,
silver. be quick! he'll die."
     fiver was off up the field like a hare. hazel, left alone, tried to understand what
was needed. what was the peg? how was he to dig it out? he looked down at the
foul mess before him. bigwig was lying across the wire, which came out under his
belly and seemed to disappear into the ground. hazel struggled with his own
incomprehension. bigwig had said, "dig." that at least he understood. he began
to scratch into the soft earth beside the body, until after a tim

e his claws scraped
against something smooth and firm. as he paused, perplexed, he found
blackberry at his shoulder.
     "bigwig just spoke," he said to him, "but i don't think he can now. he said, 'dig
out the peg.' what does that mean? what have we got to do?"
     "wait a moment," said blackberry. "let me think, and try not to be impatient."
     hazel turned his head and looked down the course of the brook. far away,
between the two copses, he could see the cherry tree where two days before he
had sat with blackberry and fiver in the sunrise. he remembered how bigwig had
chased hawkbit through the long grass, forgetting the quarrel of the previous
night in the joy of their arrival. he could see hawkbit running toward him now
and two or three of the others -- silver, dandelion and pipki

n. dandelion, well in
front, dashed up to the gap and checked, twitching and staring.
     "what is it, hazel? what's happened? fiver said--"
     "bigwig's in a wire. let him alone till blackberry tells us. stop the others
crowding round."
     dandelion turned and raced back as pipkin came up.
     "is cowslip coming?" said hazel. "perhaps he knows--"
     "he wouldn't come," replied pipkin. "he told fiver to stop talking about it."
     "told him what?" asked hazel incredulously. but at that moment blackberry
spoke and hazel was beside him in a flash.
     "this is it," said blackberry. "the wire's on a peg and the peg's in the ground --
there, look. we've got to dig it out. come on --

. silver took his place, and was
followed by buckthorn. the nasty, smooth, clean, man-smelling peg was laid bare
to the length of a rabbit's ear, but still it did not come loose. bigwig had not
moved. he lay across the wire, torn and bloody, with closed eyes. buckthorn drew
his head and paws out of the hole and rubbed the mud off his face.
     "the peg's narrower down there," he said. "it tapers. i think it could be bitten
through, but i can't get my teeth to it."

     "send pipkin in," said blackberry. "he's smaller."
     pipkin plunged into the hole. they could hear the wood splintering under his
teeth -- a sound like a mouse in a shed wainscot at midnight. he came out with
his nose bleeding.
     "the splinters prick you and it's hard to breathe, but the peg's nearly through."
     "fiver, go in," said hazel.
     fiver was not long in the hole. he, too, came out bleeding.
     "it's broken in two. it's free."
     blackberry pressed his nose against bigwig's head. as he nuzzled him gentl

the head rolled sideways and back again.
     "bigwig," said blackberry in his ear, "the peg's out."
     there was no response. bigwig lay still as before. a great fly settled on one of
his ears. blackberry thrust at it angrily and it flew up, buzzing, into the sunshine.
     "i think he's gone," said blackberry. "i can't feel his breathing."
     hazel crouched down by blackberry and laid his nostrils close to bigwig's, but
a light breeze was blowing and he could not tell whether there was breath or not.
the legs were loose, the belly flaccid and limp. he tried to think of what little he
had heard of snares. a strong rabbit could break his neck in a snare. or had the
point of the sharp wire pierced the windpipe?
     "bigwig," he whispered, "we've got you out. you're free."
     bigwig did not stir. suddenly it came to hazel that if bigwig was dead -- and

lent in the mud? -- then he himself must get the others
away before the dreadful loss could drain their courage and break their spirit -- as
it would if they stayed by the body. besides, the man would come soon. perhaps
he was already coming, with his gun, to take poor bigwig away. they must go;
and he must do his best to see that all of them -- even he himself -- put what had
happened out of mind, forever.
     "my heart has joined the thousand, for my friend stopped running today," he
said to blackberry, quoting a rabbit proverb.
     "if only it were not bigwig," said blackberry. "what shall we do without him?"
     "the others are waiting," said hazel. "we have to stay alive. there has to be
something for them to think about. help me, or it will be more than i can do."
     he turned away from the body and looked for fiver among the rabbits behind
him. but fiver was nowhere to be seen and hazel was afraid to ask for him, in
case to do so should seem like weakness and a need for comfort.

bits. then he began
speaking again.
     "and then we came, over the heather in the night. wild rabbits, making
scrapes across the valley. the warren rabbits didn't show themselves at once.
they needed to think what was best to be done. but they hit on it quite soon. to
bring us into the warren and tell us nothing. don't you see? the farmer only sets
so many snares at a time, and if one rabbit dies, the others will live that much
longer. you suggested that hazel should tell them our adventures, blackberry,
but it didn't go down well, did it? who wants to hear about brave deeds when he's
ashamed of his own, and who likes an open, honest tale from someone he's
deceiving? do you want me to go on? i tell you, every single thing that's happened
fits like a bee in a foxglove. and kill them, you say, and help ourselves to the great
burrow? we shall help ourselves to a roof of bones, hung with shining wires! help
ourselves to misery and death!"
     fiver sank down into the grass. bigwig, still trailing

 a pity! you take him, silver. i won't deprive
you. make a good job of it while you're at it."
     they stopped and waited, dotted here and there about the slope. the rabbit
who was coming was running in a curious, headlong manner. once he ran
straight into a thick-stemmed thistle, knocking himself sideways and rolling over
and over. but he got up and came blundering on toward them.
     "is it the white blindness?" said buckthorn. "he's not looking where he's
going."
     "frith forbid!" said blackberry. "shall we run away?"
     "no, he couldn't run like that with the white blindness," said hazel. "whatever
ails him, it isn't that."
     "it's strawberry!" cried dandelion.
     strawberry came through the hedge by the crab-apple tree, looked about him
and made his way to hazel. all his urbane self-possession had vanished. he was
staring and trembling and his great size seemed only to add to his air of stricken
misery. he cringed before them in the grass as hazel waited, stern and
motionless,

d each other and worked together. there was no
more quarreling. the truth about the warren had been a grim shock. they had
come closer together, relying on and valuing each other's capacities. they knew
now that it was on these and on nothing else that their lives depended, and they
were not going to waste anything they possessed between them. in spite of
hazel's efforts beside the snare, there was not one of them who had not turned
sick at heart to think that bigwig was dead and wondered, like blackberry, what
would become of them now. without hazel, without blackberry, buckthorn and
pipkin -- bigwig would have died. without himself he would have died, for which
else, of them all, would not have stopped running after such punishment? there
was no more questioning of bigwig's strength, fiver's insight, blackberry's wits or
hazel's authority. when the rats came, buckthorn and silver had obeyed bigwig
and stood their ground. the rest had followed hazel when he roused them and,
without explanation,

 relaxed and safe. he began to wonder whether
they had much to learn about their new home.
     "fiver was right," he thought. "this is the place for us. but we shall need to get
used to it and the fewer mistakes we make the better. i wonder what became of
the rabbits who made these holes? did they stop running or did they just move
away? if we could only find them they could tell us a lot."
     at this moment he saw a rabbit come rather hesitantly out of the hole furthest
from himself. it was blackberry. he, too, passed hraka, scratched himself and
then hopped into the full sunlight and combed his ears. as he began to feed,
hazel came up and fell in with him, nibbling among the grass tussocks and
wandering on wherever his friend pleased. they came to a patch of milkwort -- a
blue as deep as that of the sky -- with long stems creeping through the grass and
each minute flower spreading its two upper petals like wings. blackberry sniffed
at it, but the leaves were tough and unappetizing.
     "wh

at is this stuff, do you know?" he asked.
     "no, i don't," said hazel. "i've never seen it before."
     "there's a lot we don't know," said blackberry. "about this place, i mean. the

plants are new, the smells are new. we're going to need some new ideas
ourselves."
     "well, you're the fellow for ideas," said hazel. "i never know anything until you
tell me."
     "but you go in front and take the risks first," answered blackberry. "we've all
seen that. and now our journey's over, isn't it? this place is as safe as fiver said it
would be. nothing can get near us without our knowing: that is, as long as we can
smell and see and hear."
     "we can all do that."
     "not when we're asleep: and we can't see in the dark."
     "it's bound to be dark at night," said hazel, "and rabbits have got to sleep."
     "in the open?"
     "well, we can go on using these holes if we want to, but i expect a good many
will lie out. afte

r all, you can't expect a bunch of bucks to dig. they might make a
scrape or two -- like that day after we came over the heather -- but they won't do
more than that."
     "that's what i've been thinking about," said blackberry. "those rabbits we left
-- cowslip and the rest -- a lot of the things they did weren't natural to rabbits --
pushing stones into the earth and carrying food underground and frith knows
what."
     "the threarah's lettuce was carried underground, if it comes to that."
     "exactly. don't you see, they'd altered what rabbits do naturally because they
thought they could do better? and if they altered their ways, so can we if we like.

must be bitterly cold in winter. but there's a wood just over the top of the hill. i
got a glimpse of it last night when we came. suppose we go up higher now, just
you and i, and have a look at it?"
     they ran uphill to the summit. the beech hanger lay some little way off to the
southeast, on the far side of a grassy track that ran along the ridge.
     "there are some big trees there," said blackberry. "the roots must have broken
up the ground pretty deep. we could dig holes and be as well off as ever we were
in the old warren. but if bigwig and the others won't dig or say they can't -- well,
it's bare and bleak here. that's why it's lonely and safe, of course; but when bad
weather comes we shall be driven off the hills for sure."
     "it never entered my head to try to make a lot of bucks dig regular holes," said
hazel doubtfully, as they returned down the slope. "rabbit kittens need holes

course; but do we?"
     "we were all born in a warren that was dug before our mothers were born,"
said blackberry. "we're used to holes and not one of us has ever helped to dig
one. and if ever there was a new one, who dug it? a doe. i'm quite sure, myself,

that if we don't change our natural ways we shan't be able to stay here very long.
somewhere else, perhaps; but not here."
     "it'll mean a lot of work."
     "look, there's bigwig come up now and some of the others with him. why not
put it to them and see what they say?"
     during silflay, however, hazel mentioned blackberry's idea to no one but

see so far between the trees. the continuous, gentle rustling of the beech leaves
was unlike the sounds to be heard in a copse of nut bushes, oak and silver birch.
     moving uncertainly in and out along the edge of the hanger, they came to the
northeast corner. here there was a bank from which they looked out over the
empty stretches of grass beyond. fiver, absurdly small beside the hulking bigwig,
turned to hazel with an air of happy confidence.
     "i'm sure blackberry's right, hazel," he said. "we ought to do our best to make
some holes here. i'm ready to try, anyway."
     the others were taken aback. pipkin, however, readily joined hazel at the foot
of the bank and soon two or three more began scratching at the light soil. the
digging was easy and although they often broke off to feed or merely to sit in the
sun, before midday hazel was out of sight and tunneling between the tree roots.

 sniffing, biting and scuffling in the soil
with his front paws. hazel supposed that he was tired and pretending to be busy
while he had a rest, but at length he came back to them and said that he had some
suggestions.
     "it's this way," he explained. "there isn't a big spread of fine roots above here.
that was a lucky chance in the great burrow and i don't think you can expect to
find it again. but, all the same, we can do pretty well with what we've got."
     "and what have we got?" asked blackberry, who had come down the run while
he was talking.
     "well, we've got several thick roots that go straight down -- more than there
were in the great burrow. the best thing will be to dig round them and leave
them. they shouldn't be gnawed through and taken out. we shall need them if
we're going to have a hall of any size."

disappointed.
     "yes, it will," said strawberry, "but i can't see that it's going t

that he did, he realized that terror and fatigue had probably not been the
principal causes of holly's collapse. he was badly wounded -- worse than
buckthorn. he must have lost a lot of blood. his ear was in ribbons and there was
any amount of dirt in it. hazel felt annoyed with dandelion. as several of the
rabbits began to silflay, attracted by the mild june night and the full moon, he
asked blackberry to wait. silver, who had been about to leave by the other run,
returned and joined them.
     "dandelion and the other two seem to have cheered you up, all right," said
hazel to holly. "it's a pity they didn't clean you up as well. that dirt's dangerous."
     "well, you see--" began bluebell, who had remained beside holly.
     "don't make a joke," said hazel. "you seem to think--"
     "i wasn't going to," said bluebell. "i was only going to say that i wanted to
clean the captain's ear, but i

want 'im, 'e come.' you bet he will, as long as there's any grub or warmth going,
but surely we're not going to have the warren overrun with mice and -- and stag
beetles, are we?"
     "no, i didn't mean quite that," said hazel. "i'm not suggesting we should go
about looking for field mice and inviting them to join us. they wouldn't thank us
for that, anyway. but that mouse tonight -- we saved his life--"
     "you saved his life," said blackberry.
     "well, his life was saved. he'll remember that."
     "but how's it going to help us?" asked bluebell.
     "to start with, he can tell us what he knows about the place--"
     "what mice know. not what rabbits need to know."
     "well, i admit a mouse might or might not come in handy," said hazel. "but
i'm sure a bird would, if we could only do enough for it. we can't fly, but some of

them know the country for a long way round. they know a lot about the weather,
too. all i'm saying is

 this. if anyone finds an animal or bird, that isn't an enemy,
in need of help, for goodness' sake don't miss the opportunity. that would be like
leaving carrots to rot in the ground."
     "what do you think?" said silver to blackberry.
     "i think it's a good idea, but real opportunities of the kind hazel has in mind
aren't likely to come very often."
     "i think that's about right," said holly, wincing as silver resumed licking. "the
idea's all right as far as it goes, but it won't come to a great deal in practice."
     "i'm ready to give it a try," said silver. "i reckon it'll be worth it, just to see
bigwig telling bedtime stories to a mole."
     "el-ahrairah did it once," said bluebell, "and it worked. do you remem

   "come on," said hazel immediately to the others. "let it alone." he began to
lollop back to the wood. "let it try keeping the kestrels off for a bit."
     "what's the idea, hazel?" said silver. "that's a savage brute. you can't make a
friend out of that."
     "you may be right," said hazel. "but what's the good of a blue tit or a robin to
us? they don't fly any distance. we need a big bird."
     "but why do you want a bird so particularly?"
     "i'll explain later," said hazel. "i'd like blackberry and fiver to hear as well.
but let's go underground now. if you don't want to chew pellets, i do."
     during the afternoon hazel organized more work on the warren. the
honeycomb was as good as finished -- though rabbits are not methodical and are
never really certain when anything is finished -- and the surrounding burrows

and runs were taking shape. quite early in the evening, however, he made his way
once more to the hollow. the bird was still there. it looked weaker and less alert,

     "so when it's better it'll go on again?" said hazel.
     "yes."
     "we've been wasting our time, then."
     "why, hazel, what is it you have in mind?"
     "go and get blackberry and fiver: we'd better have silver, too. then i'll
explain."
     the quiet of the evening silflay, when the western sun shone straight along the
ridge, the grass tussocks threw shadows twice as long as themselves and the cool
air smelled of thyme and dog roses, was something which they had all come to
enjoy even more than former evenings in the meadows of sandleford. although
they could not know it, the down was more lonely than it had been for hundreds
of years. there were no sheep, and villa

the evening
sunshine on the friendly, empty down, with a good burrow at his back and the
grass turning to pellets in his belly, hazel knew that he was lonely for a doe. the

others were silent and he could tell that his words had sunk in.
     the rabbits grazed or lay basking in the sun. a lark went twittering up into the
brighter sunshine above, soared and sang and came slowly down, ending with a
sideways, spread-wing glide and a wagtail's run through the grass. the sun
dipped lower. at last blackberry said, "what's to be done? set out again?"
     "i hope not," said hazel. "it all depends. what i'd like to do is get hold of some
does and bring them here."
     "where from?"
     "another warren."
     "but are there any on these hills? how do we find out? the wind never brings
the least smell of rabbits."
     "i'll tell you how," said hazel "the bird. the bird will go and search for us."
     "hazel-rah," cried blackberry, "what a marvelous idea! that bird could find out
in a day what we co

eave him to me," said bigwig. "i think i know how to do it."
     hazel's anxiety and the reason for it were soon known to all the rabbits and
there was not one who did not realize what they were up against. there was
nothing very startling in what he had said. he was simply the one -- as a chief
rabbit ought to be -- through whom a strong feeling, latent throughout the
warren, had come to the surface. but his plan to make use of the gull excited
everyone and was seen as something that not even blackberry could have hit
upon. reconnaissance is familiar to all rabbits -- indeed, it is second nature -- but
the idea of making use of a bird, and one so strange and savage, convinced them
that hazel, if he could really do it, must be as clever as el-ahrairah himself.
     for the next few days a lot of hard work went into feeding kehaar. acorn and
pipkin, boasting that they were the best insect-catchers in the warren, brought in
great numbers of beetles and grasshoppers. at first the gull's principal

life for them, it's a doe's privilege to take them back into her body unborn."
     "yes, i remember the bargain story," said hazel. "so you think there may be
discontented does? that's hopeful. we're agreed, then, that we ought to send an
expedition to this warren and that there's a good chance of being successful
without fighting. do you want everyone to go?"
     "i'd say not," said blackberry. "two or three days' journey; and we're all in
danger, both going and coming. it would be less dangerous for three or four
rabbits than for hrair. three or four can travel quickly and aren't conspicuous:
and the chief rabbit of this warren would be less likely to object to a few
strangers coming with a civil request."
     "i'm sure that's right," said hazel. "we'll send four rabbits: and they can
explain how we come to be in this difficulty and ask to be allowed to persuade

ompanions was less easy. everyone was ready to go, but the business was so
important that at last they considered each rabbit in turn, discussing who would
be the most likely to survive the long journey, to arrive in good shape and to go
down well in a strange warren. bigwig, rejected on the grounds that he might
quarrel in strange company, was inclined to be sulky at first, but came round
when he remembered that he could go on looking after kehaar. holly himself
wanted to take bluebell but, as blackberry said, one funny joke at the expense of
the chief rabbit might ruin everything. finally they chose silver, buckthorn and
strawberry. strawberry said little, but was obviously very much pleased. he had
suffered a good deal to show that he was no coward and now he had the

satisfaction of knowing that he was worth something to his new friends.

     "what for?"
     "well, two of them are does, that's what for."
     "but if holly's successful we shall soon have plenty of does: and from all i've
ever heard of hutch rabbits, they don't take easily to wild life. the truth is, you're
just a silly show-off."
     "a silly show-off?" said hazel. "well, we'll just see whether bigwig and
blackberry think so."
     "risking your life and other rabbits' lives for something that's of little or no
value to us," said fiver. "oh, yes, of course the others will go with you. you're
their chief rabbit. you're supposed to decide what's sensible and they trust you.
persuading them will prove nothing, but three or four dead rabbits will prove
you're a fool, when it's too late."
     "oh, be quiet," answered hazel. "i'm going to sleep."

orus, he told the
others about his visit to the farm. as he had expected, bigwig jumped at the idea
of a raid to free the hutch rabbits.
     "it can't go wrong," he said. "it's a splendid idea, hazel! i don't know how you
open a hutch, but blackberry will see to that. what annoys me is to think you ran
from that cat. a good rabbit's a match for a cat, any day. my mother went for one
once and she fairly gave it something to remember, i can tell you: scratched its

fur out like willow herb in autumn! just leave the farm cats to me and one or two
of the others!"
     blackberry took a little more convincing, but he, like bigwig and hazel himself,
was secretly disappointed not to have gone on the expedition with holly; and
when the other two p

 fiver said no more and hazel turned his thoughts to the raid and the difficulty
he foresaw of getting the hutch rabbits to go the distance back to the warren.
     the next day was bright and dry, with a fresh wind that cleared up what
remained of the wet. the clouds came racing over the ridge from the south as they
had on the may evening when hazel first climbed the down. but now they were
higher and smaller, settling at last into a mackerel sky like a beach at low tide.
hazel took bigwig and blackberry to the edge of the escarpment, whence they
could look across to nuthanger on its little hill. he described the approach and
went on to explain how the rabbit hutch was to be found. bigwig was in high
spirits. the wind and the prospect of action excited him and he spent some time
with dandelion, hawkbit and speedwell, pretending to be a cat and encouraging
them to attack him as realistically as they could. hazel, whose talk with fiver had
somewhat clouded him, recovered as he watched them tussli

round the dark yard as he tried to get his bearings.
     "come on," he said. "quickly, too, while the dog's still quiet. the shed: the
hutch -- where do we go?"
     it was hawkbit who found the little yard. hazel had been anxious in case the
shed door might be shut; but it stood just ajar and the five of them slipped in one
after the other. in the thick gloom they could not make out the hutch, but they
could both smell and hear the rabbits.
     "blackberry," said bigwig quickly, "you come with me and get the hutch open.
you other three, keep watching. if another cat comes, you'll have to take it on
yourselves."
     "fine," said dandelion. "just leave it to us."
     bigwig and blackberry found the straw bale and climbed on the planks. as they
did so, boxwood spoke from the hutch.
     "who's that? hazel-rah, have you come back?"
     "hazel-rah has sent us," answered blackberry. "we've come to let you out. will
you come with us?"
     there was

a pause and some movement in the hay and then clover replied,
"yes, let us out."
     blackberry sniffed his way round to the wire door and sat up, nosing over the
frame, the hasp and the staple. it took him some time to realize that the leather
hinges were soft enough to bite. then he found that they lay so smooth and flush
with the frame that he could not get his teeth to them. several times he tried to
find a grip and at last sat back on his haunches, at a loss.
     "i don't think this door's going to be any good," he said. "i wonder whether
there's some other way?"
     at that moment
 
 ___________________________
 
 it happened that boxwood stood on his hind legs and put his
front paws high on the wire. beneath his weight the top of the door was pressed
slightly outward and the upper of the two leather hinges gave slightly where the
outer nail held it to the body of the hutch itself. as boxwood dropped back on all
fours, blackberry saw that the hinge had buckled and risen just clear of the wood.
     "try it now," he said to bigwig.
     bigwig got his teeth to the hinge and pulled. it tore a very little.
     "by frith, that'll do," said blackberry, for all the world like the duke of
wellington at salamanca. "we just need time, that's all."
     the hinge had been well made and did not give way until they had put it to a
great deal more tugging and biting. dandelion grew nervous and twice gave a
false alarm. bigwig, real

izing that the sentries were on the jump from watching
and waiting with nothing to do, changed places with him and sent speedwell up
to take over from blackberry. when at last dandelion and speedwell had pulled
the leather strip off the nail, bigwig came back to the hutch himself. but they did

not seem much nearer to success. whenever one of the rabbits inside stood up
and rested its forepaws on the upper part of the wire, the door pivoted lightly on
the axis of the staple and the lower hinge. but the lower hinge did not tear.
blowing through his whiskers with impatience, bigwig brought blackberry back
from the threshold. "what's to be done?" he said.
 
 ___________________________
 
 "we need some magic, like that
lump of wood you shoved into the river."
     blackberry looked at the door as boxwood, inside, pushed it again. the upright
of the frame pressed tight against the lower strip of leather, but it held smooth
and firm, offering no purchase for teeth.
     "push it the other way -- push from this side," he said, "you push, bigwig. tell
that rabbit inside to get down."
     when bigwig stood up and pushed the top of the door inward, the frame
immediately pivoted much further than before, because there was no sill along
the bottom of the outer side to sto

p it. the leather hinge twisted and bigwig
nearly lost his balance. if it had not been for the metal staple arresting the
pivoting, he might actually have fallen inside the hutch. startled, he jumped back,
growling.
     "well, you said magic, didn't you?" said blackberry with satisfaction. "do it
again."
     no strip of leather held by only one broad-headed nail at each end can stand
up for long to repeated twisting. soon one of the nailheads was almost out of
sight under the frayed edges.
     "careful now," said blackberry. "if it gives way suddenly, you'll go flying. just
pull it off with your teeth."
     two minutes later the door hung sagging on the staple alone. clover pushed
the hinge side open and came out, followed by boxwood.
     when several creat

 leaning on their spades and only nodding unsmilingly as the car-
drivers go through, waving their thanks. the cunning hutch door had become
nothing but a piece of wire netting, tacked to a frame made from four strips of
half-by-half; and the rabbits sat on the planks, sniffing and nosing it without
talking. after a little while the other two occupants of the hutch, laurel and
haystack, came hesitantly out and looked about them.
     "where is hazel-rah?" asked laurel.
     "not far away," said blackberry. "he's waiting in the lane."
     "what is the lane?"
     "the lane?" said blackberry in surprise. "surely--"
     he stopped as it came over him that these rabbits knew neither lane nor
farmyard. they had not the least idea of their most immediate surroundings. he
was reflecting on what this meant when bigwig spoke.
     "we mustn't wait about now," he said. "follow me, all of you."

     "but where?" said boxwood.
     "well, out of here, of course," said bigwig impatiently. boxwood looked

s plain that they
were afraid of the great, bristling buck, with his strange shock of fur and his smell
of fresh blood. they did not know what to do or understand what was expected of
them. they remembered hazel; they had been excited by the forcing of the door
and curious to come through it once it was open. otherwise, they had no purpose
whatever and no means of forming one. they had no more idea of what was
involved than a small child who says he will accompany the climbers up the fell.
     blackberry's heart sank. what was to be done with them? left to themselves,
they would hop slowly about the shed and the yard until the cats got them. of
their own accord they could no more run to the hills than fly to the moon. was
there no simple, plain idea that might get them -- or some of them -- on the
move? he turned to clover.
     "i don't suppose you've ever eaten grass by night," he said. "it tastes much
better than by day. let's all go and have some, shall we?"
     "oh, yes," said clover, "i'

d like that. but will it be safe? we're all very much
afraid of the cats, you know. they come and stare at us sometimes through the
wire and it makes us shiver."
     this showed at least the beginnings of sense, thought blackberry.
     "the big rabbit is a match for any cat," he replied. "he nearly killed one on the
way here tonight."
     "and he doesn't want to fight another if he can help it" said bigwig briskly. "so
if you do want to eat grass by moonlight, let's go to where hazel-rah's waiting for
us."
     as bigwig led the way into the yard, he could make out the shape of the cat that
he had beaten, watching from the woodpile. cat-like, it was fascinated by the
rabbits and could not leave them alone, but it evide

for
another fight and as they crossed the yard it stayed where it was.
     the pace was frighteningly slow. boxwood and clover seemed to have grasped
that there was some sort of urgency and were clearly doing their best to keep up,
but, the other two rabbits, once they had hopped into the yard, sat up and looked
about them in a foolish manner, completely at a loss. after a good deal of delay,
during which the cat left the woodpile and began to move stealthily round toward
the side of the shed, blackberry managed to get them out into the farmyard. but
here, finding themselves in an even more open place, they settled into a kind of
static panic, like that which sometimes comes upon inexperienced climbers
exposed on a sheer face. they could not move, but sat blinking and staring about
them in the darkness, taking no notice of blackberry's coaxing or bigwig's orders.
at this moment a second cat -- hazel's tabby -- came round the further end of the
farmhouse and made toward them. as it passed the ke

quickly, too." blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit ran at once, taking boxwood

and clover with them into the darkness under the barn. dandelion remained
beside haystack, begging her to move and expecting every moment to feel the
cat's claws in his back. bigwig leaped across to him.
     "dandelion," he said in his ear, "get out of it, unless you want to be killed!"
     "but the--" began dandelion.
     "do as i say!" said bigwig. the noise of barking was fearful and he himself was
close to panic. dandelion hesitated a

longer. then he left haystack and
shot up the lane, with bigwig beside him.
     they found the others gathered round hazel, under the bank. boxwood and
clover were trembling and seemed exhausted. hazel was talking to them
reassuringly, but broke off as bigwig appeared out of the dark. the dog stopped
barking and there was quiet.
     "we're all here," said bigwig. "shall we go, hazel?"
     "but there were four hutch rabbits," said hazel. "where are the other two?"
     "in the farmyard," said blackberry. "we couldn't do anything with them: and
then the dog began to bark."
     "yes, i heard it. you mean they're loose?"
     "they'll be a lot looser soon," said bigwig angrily. "the cats are there."
     "why did you leave them, then?"
     "because they wouldn't move. it was bad enough before the dog started."
     "is the dog tied?" asked hazel.
     "yes, it's tied. but do you expect any rabbit to stand his ground a few feet from
an angry dog?"
     "no, of course not," replied hazel. "you've

 done wonders, bigwig. they were
just telling me, before you came, that you gave one of the cats such a beating that
it was afraid to come back for more. now look, do you think you and blackberry,
with speedwell here and hawkbit, can get these two rabbits back to the warren?
i'm afraid you may need most of the night. they can't go very fast and you'll have
to be patient with them. dandelion, you come with me, will you?"
     "where, hazel-rah?"
     "to fetch the other two," said hazel. "you're the fastest, so it won't be so
dangerous for you, will it? now, don't hang about, bigwig, there's a good fellow.
i'll see you tomorrow."
     before bigwig could reply he had disappeared under th

     the silence returned, but still hazel lay motionless in the whispering chill of
the tunnel. a cold lassitude came over him and he passed into a dreaming, inert
stupor, full of cramp and pain. after a time, a thread of blood began to trickle
over the lip of the drain into the trampled, deserted ditch.

          -<*>-

     bigwig, crouched close to blackberry in the straw of the cattle shed, leaped to
flight at the sound of the shot two hundred yards up the lane. he checked himself
and turned to the others.
     "don't run!" he said quickly. "where do you want to run to, anyway? no holes
here."
     "further away from the gun," replied blackberry, white-eyed.
     "wait!" said bigwig, listening. "they're running down the lane. can't you hear
them?"
     "i can hear only two rabbits," answered blackberry, after a pause, "and one of
them sounds exhaus
 
 ___________________________
 
    "i didn't actually see him hit, but they were very close to him."
     "we'd better wait," said bigwig.
     they waited a long time. at last dandelion and bigwig went cautiously back up

the lane. they found the bottom of the ditch trampled by boots and streaked with
blood, and returned to tell the others.
     the journey back, with the three limping hutch rabbits, lasted more than two
weary hours. all were dejected and wretched. when at last they reached the foot
of the down bigwig told blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit to leave them and go
on to the warren. they approached the wood just at first light and a rabbit ran to
meet them through the wet grass. it was fiver. blackberry stopped and waited
beside him while the other two went on in silence.
     "fiver," he said, "there's bad news. hazel--"
     "i know," replied fiver. "i know now."
     "how do you know?" asked blackberry, startled.
     "as you came through the grass just now," said fiver, very low, "there was a
fourth rabbit b

ehind you, limping and covered with blood. i ran to see who it was,
and then there were only three of you, side by side."
     he paused and looked across the down, as though still seeking the bleeding
rabbit who had vanished in the half-light. then, as blackberry said nothing more,
he asked, "do you know what happened?"
     when blackberry had told his news, fiver returned to the warren and went
underground to his empty burrow. a little later bigwig brought the hutch rabbits
up the hill and at once called everyone to meet in the honeycomb. fiver did not
appear.
     it was a dismal welcome for the strangers. not even bluebell could find a
cheerful word. dandelion was inconsolable to think that he might have stopped
hazel breaking from the ditch. the meeting came to an end in a dreary silence
and a half-hearted silflay.

 hole. it was circular, a
cylinder of baked earthenware that disappeared vertically into the ground. he
called, "hazel! hazel!" far down in the bole, something moved and he was about
to call again. then the man bent down and hit him between the ears.
     fiver was struggling in a thick cloud of earth, soft and powdery. someone was
saying, "steady, fiver, steady!" he sat up. there was soil in his eyes, his ears and
nostrils. he could not smell. he shook himself and said, "who is it?"
     "it's blackberry. i came to see how you were. it's all right; a bit of the roof's
fallen, that's all. there've been falls all over the warren today -- it's the heat.
anyway, it woke you from a nightmare, if i know anything. you were thrashing
about and calling out for hazel. you poor old chap! what a miserable thing it is to
have happened! we must try to bear it as best we can. we've all got to stop
running one day, you know. they say frith knows all the rabbits, every one."
     "is it evening?" asked fiver.

     "could you go there with me now?"
     "go back there? oh, no. it's a long way, fiver, and what would be the good?

     "then i shall have to go alone. but what i'm asking you to do is to come and
save hazel's life."
     when at last blackberry had reluctantly given in and they had set out down the
hill, fiver went almost as fast as though he were running for cover. again and
again he urged blackberry to make haste. the fields were empty in the glare.
every creature bigger than a bluebottle was sheltering from the heat. when they
reached the outlying sheds beside the lane, blackberry began to explain how he
and bigwig had gone back to search; but fiver cut him short.
     "we have to go up the slope, i know that: but you must show me the ditch."

     the elms were still. there was not the least sound in the leaves. the ditch was
thick with cow parsley, hemlock and long trails of green-flow

blackberry led the way to the trampled patch of nettles and fiver sat still among
them, sniffing and looking about him in the silence. blackberry watched him
disconsolately. a faint breath of wind stole across the fields and a blackbird began
to sing from somewhere beyond the elms. at last fiver began to move along the
bottom of the ditch. the insects buzzed round his ears and suddenly a little cloud
of flies flew up, disturbed from a projecting stone. no, not a stone. it was smooth
and regular -- a circular lip of earthenware. the brown mouth of a drain, stained
black at the lower edge by a thin, dried thread of blood: of rabbit's blood

.
     "the bloody hole!" whispered fiver. "the bloody hole!"
     he peered into the dark opening. it was blocked. blocked by a rabbit. that was
plain to be smelled. a rabbit whose faint pulse could just be heard, magnified in
the confined tunnel.
     "hazel?" said fiver.
     blackberry was beside him at once. "what is it, fiver?"
     "hazel's in that hole," said fiver, "and he's alive."

then another came down the runs that led from the smaller burrows. all w

lost so poorly in his thoughts? they would die, perhaps, or wander away. he

buckled once more to the task of explaining that he was sure better times lay
ahead -- and as he did so, felt himself the least convinced of any.
     bigwig had sent acorn to see whether there was anyone still to come. acorn
returned to say that strawberry felt too ill and that he could find neither
blackberry nor fiver.
     "well, leave fiver," said bigwig. "poor fellow, he'll feel better by himself for a
time, i dare say."
     "he's not in his burrow, though," said acorn.
     "never mind," said bigwig. but the thought came to him, "fiver and
blackberry? could they have left the warren without telling anyone? if they have,
what will happen when the others get to know?" should he ask kehaar to go and
look for them while there was still light? but if kehaar found them, what then?
they could not be

don't mind."
     they moved slowly across the sunset grass, nibbling as they went: clover was
soon absorbed in feeding, but holly stopped continually to sit up and sniff about
him at the peaceful, empty down. when he noticed bigwig, a little way off, staring
fixedly to the north, he at once followed his gaze.

     "what is it?" he asked.
     "it's blackberry," replied bigwig. he sounded relieved.
     blackberry came hopping rather slowly down from the skyline. he looked tired
out, but as soon as he saw the other rabbits he came on faster and made his way
to bigwig.
     "where have you been?" asked bigwig. "and where's fiver? wasn't he with
you?"
     "fiver's with hazel," said blackberry. "hazel's alive. he's been wounded -- it's
hard to tell how badly -- but he won't die."
     the other three rabbits looked at him speechlessly. blackberry waite

enjoying the effect.
     "hazel's alive?" said bigwig. "are you sure?"
     "quite sure," said blackberry. "he's at the foot of the hill at this very moment,
in that ditch where you were the night holly and bluebell arrived."
     "i can hardly believe it," said holly. "if it's true, it's the best news i've ever
heard in my life. blackberry, you really are sure? what happened? tell us."
     "fiver found him," said blackberry. "fiver took me with him, nearly all the way
back to the farm: then he went along the ditch and found hazel gone to ground
up a land drain. he was very weak from loss of blood and he couldn't get out of
the drain by himself. we had to drag him by his good hind leg. he couldn't turn
round, you see."
     "but how on earth did fiver know?"
     "how does fiver know what he knows? you'd better ask him. when we'd got
hazel into the ditch, fiver looked to see how badly he was hurt. he's got a nasty

'there's nothing to worry about. we can take our time.' after what i'd seen, i'd
have believed him if he'd said we could hunt foxes. but when we got to the bottom
of the hill hazel was completely finished and he couldn't go any further. he and
fiver have taken shelter in the overgrown ditch and i came on to tell you. and
here i am."
     there was silence while bigwig and holly took in the news. at last bigwig said,
"will they stay there tonight?"
     "i think so," replied blackberry. "i'm sure hazel won't be able to manage the
hill until he's a good deal stronger."
     "i'll go down there," said bigwig. "i can help to make the ditch a bit more
comfortable, and probably fiver will be able to do with someone else to help to
look after hazel"
     "i should hurry, then, if i were you," said blackberry. "the sun will be down
soon."
     "hah!" said bigwig, "if i meet a stoat, it'd better look out, that's all. i'll bring
you one back tomorrow, shall i?" he raced off and disapp

have to tell the whole thing, from the beginning."
     the three quarters of a mile in the blazing heat, from nuthanger to the foot of
the hill, had cost hazel more pain and effort than anything in his life. if fiver had
not found him, he would have died in the drain. when fiver's urging had
penetrated his dark, ebbing stupor, he had at first actually tried not to respond. it
was so much easier to remain where he was, on the far side of the suffering he
had undergone. later, when he fo

und himself lying in the green gloom of the
ditch, with fiver searching his wounds and assuring him that he could stand and
move, still he could not face the idea of setting out to return. his torn side
throbbed and the pain in his leg seemed to have affected his senses. he felt dizzy
and could not hear or smell properly. at last, when he understood that fiver and
blackberry had risked a second journey to the farm, in the broadest of daylight,
solely to find him and save his life, he forced himself to his feet and began to
stumble down the slope to the road. his sight was swimming and he had to stop
again and again. without fiver's encouragement he would have lain down once
more and given up. in the road, he could not climb the bank and had to limp
along the verge until he could crawl under a gate. much later, as they came under
the pylon line, he remembered the ov

     "oh, you remember him? i felt that when we were listening to him, you know.
he terrified me and yet i knew that i understood him better than anyone else in
that place. he knew where he belonged, and it wasn't here. poor fellow, i'm sure
he's dead. they'd got him, all right -- the ones in that country. they don't give
their secrets away for nothing, you know. but look! here come holly and
blackberry, so we'd better feel sure we're here just for the moment, anyway."
     holly had already come down the hill on the previous day to see hazel and tell
again the story of his escape from efrafa. when he had spoken of his deliverance
by the great apparition in the night, fiver had listened attentively and asked one
question, "did it make a noise?" later, when holly had gone back, he told hazel
that he felt sure there was some natural explanation, though he had no idea what
it could be. hazel, how

     "it can't be done."
     "it can't be done by fighting or fair words, no. so it will have to be done by
means of a trick."
     "there's no trick will get the better of that lot, believe me. there are far more
of them than there are of us: they're very highly organized: and i'm only telling
the truth when i say that they can fight, run and follow a trail every bit as well as
we can, and a lot of them, much better."
     "the trick," said hazel, turning to blackberry, who all this time had been
nibbling and listening in silence, "the trick will have to do three things. first, it

will have to get the does out of efrafa and secondly it will have to put paid to the
pursuit. for a pursuit there's bound to be and we can't expect another miracle.
but that's not all. once we're clear of the place, we've got to become impossible to
find -- beyond the reach of any wide patrol."
     "yes," said blackberry doubtfully. "yes, i agree. to succeed we should have to

age all those things."
     "yes. and this trick, blackberry, is going to be devised by you."
     the sweet, carrion scent of dogwood filled the air; in the evening sunshine, the
insects hummed around the dense white cymes hanging low above the grass. a
pair of brown-and-orange beetles, disturbed by the feeding rabbits, took off from
a grass stem and flew away, still coupled together.
     "they mate. we don't," said hazel, watching them go. "a trick, blackberry: a
trick to put us right once and for all."
     "i can see how to do the first thing," said blackberry. "at least, i think i can.
but it's dangerous. the other two i can't see at all yet and i'd like to talk it over
with fiver."
     "the sooner fiver and i get back to the warren the better," said hazel. "my
leg's good enough now, but all the same i think we'll leave it for tonight. good old
holly, will you tell them that fiver and i will come early tomorrow morning? it

     the following morning all the rabbits were out at silflay by dawn and there was
a good deal of excitement as they waited for hazel. during the previous few days
blackberry had had to repeat several times the story of the journey to the farm
and the finding of hazel in the drain. one or two had suggested that kehaar must
have found hazel and told fiver secretly. but kehaar denied this and, when

pressed, replied cryptically that fiver was one who had traveled a good deal
further than he had himself. as for hazel, he had acquired, in everyone's eyes, a
kind of magical quality. of all the warren, dandelion was the last rabbit to fail to
do justice to a good story a

e afternoon hazel called everyone into the honeycomb.
     "i've been thinking things over," he said. "i know you must all have been really
disappointed not to have got rid of me at nuthanger farm the other day, so i've
decided to go a bit further next time."
     "where?" asked bluebell.
     "to efrafa," replied hazel, "if i can get anyone to come with me: and we shall
bring back as many does as the warren needs."
     there were murmurs of astonishment, and then speedwell asked, "how?"
     "blackberry and i have got a plan," said hazel, "but i'm not going to explain it
now, for this reason. you all know that this is going to be a dangerous business. if
any of you get caught and taken into efrafa, they'll make you talk, all right. but
those who don't know a plan can't give it away. i'll explain it later on, at the
proper time."
     "are you going to need many rabbits, hazel-rah?" asked dandelion. "from all i
hear, the whole lot of us wouldn't be enough to fight the efrafans."
     "i hope we

chance we meet a wide patrol on the way, there have got to be enough of us to
deal with them."
     "would we have to go into efrafa?" asked pipkin timidly.
     "no," said hazel, "we shall--"
     "i never thought, hazel," interrupted holly, "i never thought that the time
would come when i should feel obliged to speak against you. but i can only say
again that this is likely to be a complete disaster. i know what you think -- you're
counting on general woundwort not having anyone as clever as blackberry and
fiver. you're quite right -- i don't think he has. but the fact remains that no one
can get a bunch of does away from that place. you all know that i've spent my life
patrolling and tracking in the open. well, there are rabbits in the efrafan owsla
who are better at it than i am -- i'm admitting it: and they'll hunt you down with
your does and kill you. great frith! we all have to meet our match some time or
other! i know you want only to help us all, but do be sensible and give this

if we're really going to make fools of them i want to be there,
as long as i don't have to go back inside the place -- that i couldn't face. but, after
all, you're going to need someone who knows the way."
     "i'll come," said pipkin. "hazel-rah saved my -- i mean, i'm sure he knows
what's--" he became confused. "anyway, i'll come," he repeated, in a very
nervous voice.
     there was a scuffling in the run that led down from the wood and hazel called,
"who's that?"
     "it's i, hazel-rah -- blackberry."
     "blackberry!" said hazel. "why, i thought you'd been here all the time. where
have you been?"
     "sorry not to have come before," said blackberry. i've been talking to kehaar,
as a matter of fact, about the plan. he's improved it a good deal. if i'm not
mistaken, general woundwort's going to look remarkably silly before we've
finished. i thought at first that it couldn't be done, but now i feel sure it can."

roused their curiosity. he had hoped
that, with fiver behind him, he could lure them with hints and promises: and he
had been right. the rabbits trusted him and fiver, who had gotten them out of
sandleford before it was too late, crossed the enborne and the common, taken
bigwig out of the wire, founded the warren on the downs, made an ally of kehaar
and produced two does against all odds. there was no telling what they would do
next. but they were evidently up to something; and since bigwig and blackberry
seemed to be confidently in on it, no one was ready to say that he would rather
stay out; especially since hazel had made it clear that anyone who wished could
remain at home and welcome -- implying that if he was so poor-spirited as to
choose to miss the exploit, they could do without him. holly, in whom loyalty was
second nature, had said no more to queer the pitch. he accompanied them as far
as the end of the wood with all the cheerfulness he could muster; only begging
hazel, out of hearing

and now
all the rabbits were either nibbling quietly or resting, with ears laid flat, in the
light green sun-and-shade of the thorn thicket
     "is bigwig there?" asked hazel.
     throughout the morning bigwig had seemed unlike himself -- silent and
preoccupied, with little attention for what was going on around him. if his
courage had not been beyond question, it might have been thought that he was
feeling nervous. during one long halt bluebell had overheard him talking with
hazel, fiver and blackberry, and later had told pipkin that it sounded for all the
world as though bigwig were being reassured. "fighting, yes, anywhere," he had
heard him say, "but i still reckon that this game is more in someone else's line
than mine." "no," replied hazel, "you're the only one that can do it: and
remember, this isn't sport, if the farm raid was. everything depends on it." then,
realizing that bluebell could hear him, he added, "anyway, keep on thinking

about it and try to get used to the idea. we must

     "it sounds better than i'd hoped for," said fiver. "i hate to say it, but i think we

we're in danger all the time we're on the down, but once we get off it we can rest."
     "well, i suppose we'd better go on by night, if they'll do it -- we've done it
before -- but they must feed and rest first. start fu inlé? there'll be a moon."
     "oh, how i've come to loathe those words 'start' and 'fu inlé,'" said blackberry.
     however, the evening feed was peaceful and cool and after a time everyone felt
refreshed. as the sun was sinking, hazel brought them all together, under close
cover, to chew pellets and rest. although he did his best to appear confident and
cheerful, he could feel that they were on edge, and after parrying one or two
questions about the plan, he began to wonder how he could distract their
thoughts and get them to relax until they were ready to set off again. he
remembered the time, on the

r, but still the fox paid no attention.
     "hazel," said silver from behind, "shall i--?"
     "no one is to move," said hazel quickly. "keep still, all of you."
     at about thirty yards' distance the fox saw the approaching rabbit. it paused
for a moment and then continued to trot forward. it was almost upon him before
bigwig turned and began to limp up the north slope of the combe toward the trees
of the belt. the fox hesitated again and then followed him.
     "what's he up to?" muttered blackberry.
     "trying to draw it off, i suppose," replied fiver.
     "but he didn't have to! we should have got away without that."
     "confounded fool!" said hazel. "i don't know when i've been so angry."
     the fox had quickened its pace and was now some distance away from them. it
appeared to be overtaking bigwig. the sun had set and in the failing light they
could just make him out as he entered the undergrowth. he disappeared and the

fox followed. for several moments all was quiet. then, ho

rribly clear across the
darkening, empty combe, there came the agonizing squeal of a stricken rabbit.
     "o frith and inlé!" cried blackberry, stamping. pipkin turned to bolt. hazel did
not move.
     "shall we go, hazel?" asked silver. "we can't help him now."
     as he spoke, bigwig suddenly broke out of the trees, running very fast. almost
before they could grasp that he was alive, he had recrossed the entire upper slope
of the combe in a single dash and bolted in among them.
     "come on," said bigwig, "let's get out of here!"
     "but what -- what -- are you wounded?" asked bluebell in bewilderment.
     "no," said bigwig, "n

     hazel sniffed. in the cool damp, he picked up at once the unnatural smells of
metal, coal smoke and oil. they went forward and in a very short time found
themselves looking down from among the bushes and undergrowth on the edge
of the railway cutting. all was quiet, but as they paused at the top of the bank, a
tussling pack of six or seven sparrows flew down to the line and began to peck
about between the sleepers. somehow, the sight was reassuring.
     "are we to cross, hazel-rah?" asked blackberry.
     "yes," said hazel, "at once. put it between us and efrafa: then we'll feed."
     they went rather hesitantly down into the cutting, half expecting the fiery,
thundering angel of frith to appear out of the twilight; but the silence remained
unbroken. soon they were all feeding in the meadow beyond, too tired to pay
attention to concealment or to anything but the ease of resting their legs and
nibbling the grass.
     from above the larches kehaar sailed down among them, alighted and folde

ing impatiently in the long grass. hazel sat up quickly.
     "what is it, kehaar? not a patrol?"
     "na, na. ees all fine for sleep like bloody owls. maybe i go for peeg vater.

meester 'azel, you getting mudders now soon? vat for vait now?"
     "no, you're right, kehaar, we must start now. the trouble is, i can see how to
start but not how to finish."
     hazel made his way through the grass, roused the first rabbit he found -- who
happened to be bluebell -- and sent him to fetch bigwig, blackberry and fiver.
when they came, he took them to join kehaar on the short grass of the riverbank.
     "this is the problem, blackberry," he said. "you remember that when we were
under the down that evening i said we should have to do three things: get the
does out of efrafa, break up the pursuit and then get right away so that they
wouldn't find us. this plan you've thought up is clever. it'll do the first two things,
all right, i'm sure of that. but what about the last one? the efrafan rabbits are

fast and savage. they'll find us if we're to be found and i don't believe we can run
away faster than they can follow -- especially with a lot of does who've never been
out of efrafa. we couldn't possibly stand and fight them to a finish -- we're too
few. and on top of that, my leg seems to be bad again. so what's to be done?"
     "i don't know," answered blackberry. "but, obviously, we shall need to
disappear. could we swim the river? no scent then, you know."
     "it's too swift," said hazel. "we'd be carried away. but even if we did swim it,
we couldn't count on not being followed. from what i've heard of these efrafans,
they'd certainly swim the river if they thought we had. what it comes to is that,
with kehaar to help us, we can break up a pursuit while we're getting the does
out, but they'll know which way we've gone and they won't leave it at that

. no,
you're right, we've got to vanish without a trace, so that they can't even track us.
but how?"
     "i don't know," said blackberry again. "shall we go up the river a little way and
have a look at it? perhaps there's somewhere we could use for a hiding place. can
you manage that, with your leg?"
     "if we don't go too far," replied hazel.
     "can i come, hazel-rah?" asked bluebell, who had been waiting about, a little
way off.
     "yes, all right," said hazel good-naturedly, as he began to limp along the bank
upstream.
     they soon realized that the woodland on this left bank was lonely, thick and
overgrown -- denser

 than the nut copses and bluebell woods of sandleford.
several times they heard the drumming of a great woodpecker, the shyest of
birds. as blackberry was suggesting that perhaps they might look for a hiding
place somewhere in this jungle, they became aware of another sound -- the falling
water which they had heard on their approach the day before. soon they reached
a place where the river curved round in a bend from the east, and here they came
upon the broad, shallow fall. it was no more than a foot high -- one of those
artificial falls, common on the chalk streams, made to attract trout. several were
already rising to the evening hatch of

fly. just above the fall a plank footbridge
crossed the river. kehaar flew up, circled the pool and perched on the hand rail.
     "this is more sheltered and lonely than the bridge we crossed last night," said
blackberry. "perhaps we could make some use of it. you didn't know about this
bridge, kehaar, did you?"
     "na, not know, not see heem. but ees goot pridge -- no von come."

     "i'd like to go across, hazel-rah," said blackberry.
     "well, fiver's the rabbit for that," replied hazel. "he simply loves crossing
bridges. you carry on. i'll come behind, with bigwig and bluebell here."
     the five rabbits hopped slowly along the planks, their great, sensitive ears full
of the sound of the falling water. hazel, who was not sure of his footing, had to
stop several times. when at length he reached the further side, he found that
fiver and blackberry had already gone a little way downstream below the fall and
were looking a
 
 ___________________________
 
similar object -- large, smooth and
flat. (that had, in fact, been an old, discarded door.) it had been of no use to them
and they had left it alone. his inclination was to leave this alone, too.
     one end of the thing was pressed into the bank, but along its length it
diverged, sticking out slightly into the stream. there were ripples round it, for
under the banks the current was as swift as in midstream, on account of weed-
cutting and sound camp-sheeting. as hazel came nearer, he saw that blackberry
had actually scrambled on the thing. his claws made a faint hollow sound on the
wood, so there must be water underneath. whatever it might be, the thing did not
extend downward to the bottom: it was lying on the water.
     "what are you after, blackberry?" he said rather sharply.
     "food," replied blackberry. "flayrah. can't you smell it?"
     kehaar had alighted on the middle of the thing, and was snapping away at
something white. blackberry scuttered along the wood toward him and began t

o
nibble at some kind of greenstuff. after a little while hazel also ventured out on
the wood and sat in the sunshine, watching the flies on the warm, varnished
surface and sniffing the strange river smells that came up from the water.
     "what is this man thing, kehaar?" he asked. "is it dangerous?"
     "na, no dangerous. you not know? ees poat. at peeg vater is many, many
poat. men make dem, go on vater. ees no harm."
     kehaar went on pecking at the broken pieces of stale bread. blackberry, who
had finished the fragments of lettuce he had found, was sitting up and looking
over the very low side, watching a stone-colored, black-spotted trout swim up
into the fall. the "boat" was a miniature punt, used for reed-cutting -- little more
than a raft, with a single thwart amidships. even when it was unmanned, as now,
there were only a few inches of freeboard.
     "you know," said fiver from the bank, "seeing you sitting there reminds me of
that other wooden thing you found when the dog

 was in the wood and you got
pipkin and me over the river. do you remember?"
     "i remember shoving you along," said bigwig. "it was jolly cold."
     "what puzzles me," said blackberry, "is why this boat thing doesn't go along.
everything in this river goes along, and fast, too -- see there." he looked out at a
piece of stick floating down on the even two-mile-an-hour current. "so what's
stopping this thing from going?"
     kehaar had a short-way-with-landlubbers manner which he sometimes used to
those of the rabbits that he did not particularly like. blackberry was not one of his

favorites: he preferred straightforward characters such as bigwig, buckthorn and
silver.

water rabbit."
     "a what?" asked bigwig.
     "a water rabbit," repeated bluebell. "well, there are water rats and water
beetles and pipkin says that last night he saw a water hawk. so why not a water
rabbit? i shall float merrily along--"
     "great golden frith on a hill!" cried blackberry suddenly. "great jumping
rabscuttle! that's it! that's it! bluebell, you shall be a water rabbit!" he began
leaping and skipping about on the bank and cuffing fiver with his front paws.
"don't you see, fiver? don't you see? we bite the rope and off we go: and general
woundwort doesn't know!"
     fiver paused. "yes, i do see," he replied at length. "you mean on the boat. i
must say, blackberry, you're a clever fellow. i remember now that after we'd
crossed that other river you said that that fl

do you mind explaining?"
     then and there, while the black gnats settled on their ears, by the plank bridge
and the pouring waterfall, blackberry and fiver explained.
     "could you just go and try the rope, hazel-rah?" added blackberry, when he
had finished. "it may be too thick."
     they went back to the punt.
     "no, it's not," said hazel, "and it's stretched tight, of course, which makes it
much easier to gnaw. i can gnaw that, all right."
     "ya, ees goot," said kehaar. "you go fine. but you do heem queek, ya? maybe
somet'ing change. man come, take poat -- you know?"

or a moment before hopping out under the
hawthorn. it was clear that chervil prided himself on knowing his rabbits by
name. he spoke to most of them and was at pains to show that he had some
knowledge of their personal lives. it seemed to bigwig that the answers he got
were not particularly warm or friendly, but he did not know whether to put that
down to dislike of chervil or merely to the lack of spirit that seemed to be
common to the rank and file in efrafa. he was closely on the watch -- as
blackberry had advised him to be -- for any signs of disaffection or rebellion, but
he could see little grounds for hope in the expressionless faces that went by. at
the end came a little group of three or four does, talking among themselves.
     "well, are you getting on all right with your new friends, nelthilta?" said
chervil to the first, as she passed him.
     the doe, a pretty, long-nosed rabbit not more than three months old, stopped
and looked at him.

could see no flaw in this idea. then the thought came to him, "and what about

blackavar?" blackavar presumably spent the day under guard in some special
burrow. probably hardly anyone knew where -- no one knew anything in efrafa --
and certainly no one would tell. so he would have to leave blackavar: no realistic
plan could include him.
     "i'll be jiggered if i leave him," muttered bigwig to himself. "i know blackberry
would say i was a fool. still, he's not here and i'm doing this myself. but suppose i
wreck the whole thing because of blackavar? oh, frith in a barn! what a
business!"
     he thought until he realized that he was thinking in circles. after a time, he fell
asleep. when he woke, he could tell that it was moonlight outside, fine and still. it
occurred to him that perhaps he might start his venture from the other end -- by
persuading some of the does to join him and working out a plan afterward,

t do you think?"
     "if i know them, they won't alter anything they usually do," said silver. "but if
you're worried in case we're not there in time, why not go now?"
     "because they're always patrolling. the longer we wait up there, the greater the
risk. if a patrol finds us before bigwig comes, it won't be just a matter of getting
ourselves away. they'll realize we're there for some purpose and give the alarm,
and that'll be the end of any chance he's got."
     "listen, hazel-rah," said blackberry. "we ought to reach the iron road at the
same time as bigwig and not a moment before. why don't you take them all over
the river now and wait in the undergrowth, near the boat? once kehaar's attacked
the sentries, he can fly back and tell us."
     "yes, that's it," answered hazel. "but once he's told us, we must get up there in
no time at all. bigwig's going to need us as well as kehaar."
     "well, you won't be able to dash up to the arch," said fiver, "with your leg. the
best thing you can

do is to get on the boat and have the rope gnawed half through
by the time we come back. silver can look after the fighting, if there's going to be
any."
     hazel hesitated. "but some of us are probably going to get hurt. i can't stay
behind."
     "fiver's right," said blackberry. "you will have to wait on the boat, hazel. we
can't risk your being left to be picked up by the efrafans. besides, it's very
important that the rope should be half gnawed -- that's a job for someone
sensible. it mustn't break too soon or we're all finished."
     it took them some time to persuade hazel. when at last he agreed, he was still
reluctant.
     "if bigwig doesn't come tonight," he said, "i shall go and find him, wherever he
is. frith knows what may have happened already."

able to move or to understand what was said to them, were urged into getting up
and stumbling their way down the field. other rabbits began to appear through
the rain: acorn, clearly frightened, but determined not to run; dandelion
encouraging pipkin; speedwell and hawkbit making toward kehaar -- the only
creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made them understand that they were to help to get the
does away.
     "go back to blackberry, go back to blackberry," silver kept repeating. "i left
three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then bluebell, then fiver -- he's quite near the river."
     "and there is blackberry," said bigwig.
     "you did it, then, bigwig," said blackberry, shivering. "was it very bad? good
heavens, your shoulder--"
     "it's not finished yet," said bigwig. "has everyone passed you?"
     "you're the last," said blackberry. "can we go?

opping in the rain. the level did not appear
to have risen much as yet. the boat was just as he remembered it -- one end
against the bank, the other a little way out in the stream. on the raised part at the
near end hazel was crouching, his ears drooping on either side of his head and his
flattened fur completely black with rain. he was holding the taut rope in his
teeth. acorn, hyzenthlay and two more were crouching near him on the wood,
but the rest were huddled here and there along the bank. blackberry was trying
unsuccessfully to persuade them to get out on the boat.
     "hazel's afraid to leave the rope," he said to bigwig. "apparently he's bitten it
very thin already. all these does will say is that you're their officer."
     bigwig turned to thethuthinnang.
     "this is the magic trick now," he said. "get them over there, where
hyzenthlay's sitting, do you see? all of them -- quickly."
     before she could reply, another doe gave a squeal of fear. a little way

s they might.
     bigwig began to understand why woundwort's officers followed him and
fought for him as they did.
     "he's not like a rabbit at all," he thought. "flight's the last thing he ever thinks
of. if i'd known three nights ago what i know now, i don't believe i'd ever have
gone into efrafa. i suppose he hasn't realized about the boat, too? it wouldn't
surprise me." he dashed across the grass and jumped on the planking beside
hazel.
     the appearance of woundwort had achieved what blackberry and fiver could
not. every one of the does ran from the bank to the boat. blackberry and fiver
ran with them. woundwort, following them close, reached the edge of the bank
and came face to face with bigwig. as he stood his ground, bigwig could hear
blackberry just behind him, speaking urgently to hazel.
     "dandelion's not here," said blackberry. "he's the only one."
     hazel spoke for the first time. "we shall have to leave him," he answered. "it's
a shame, but these fellows will be at us

     on almost any other river, blackberry's plan would not have worked. the punt
would not have left the bank or, if it had, would have run aground or been fouled
by weeds or some other obstruction. but here, on the test, there were no
submerged branches and no gravel spits or beds of weed above the surface at all.
from bank to bank the current, regular and unvaried, flowed as fast as a man
strolling. the punt slipped downstream smoothly, without any alteration of the
speed which it had gained within a few yards of leaving the bank.

ng. some of the rabbits, in the first
confusion of boarding the punt, had found themselves in this water, but now all
had got clear of it -- most either to bows or stern, though thethuthinnang and
speedwell were hunched on the narrow thwart, amidships. in addition to their
discomfort, they were exposed and helpless. finally, there was no way of
controlling the punt and they did not know where they were going. but these last
were troubles beyond the understanding of everyone but hazel, fiver and
blackberry.

     bigwig had collapsed beside hazel and lay on his side, exhausted. the feverish
courage which had brought him from efrafa to the river had gone and his
wounded shoulder had begun to hurt badly. in spite of the rain and the throbbing
pulse down his foreleg, he felt ready to sleep where he was, stretched upon the
planking. he opened his eyes and looked up at hazel.
     "i couldn't do it again, hazel-rah," he said.
     "you haven't got to," replied hazel.
     "it was touch and go, you kn

     "did you beat him?"
     "oh, yes -- or i shouldn't be here. i should think he'll stop running. i say,
hazel-rah, we've got the does. what's going to happen now?"
     "i don't know," said hazel. "we need one of these clever rabbits to tell us. and
kehaar -- where's he gone? he's supposed to know about this thing we're sitting
on."
     dandelion, crouching beside hazel, got up at the mention of "clever rabbits,"
made his way across the puddled floor and returned with blackberry and fiver.
     "we're all wondering what to do next," said hazel.
     "well," said blackberry, "i suppose we shall drift into the bank before long and
then we can get out and find cover. there's no harm, though, in going a good long
way from those friends of bigwig's."
     "there is," said hazel. "we're stuck here in full view and we can't run. if a man
sees us we're in trouble."
     "men don't like rain," said blackberry. "neither do i, if it comes to that, but it
makes us safer just now."

her.
     they had floated not quite half a mile in just over fifteen minutes.
     hazel put his forepaws on the low side and looked gingerly over upstream.
immediately below, a shallow ripple spread all along the waterline, where the
current met the woodwork. it was too far to jump to the shore and both banks
were steep. he turned and looked upward. the brickwork was sheer, with a
projecting course half way between him and the parapet. there was no
scrambling up that.
     "what's to be done, blackberry?" he asked, making his way to the bolt fixed on
the bow, with its ragged remnant of painter. "you got us on this thing. how do we
get off?"
     "i don't know, hazel-rah," replied blackberry. "of all the ways we could finish
up, i never thought of this. it looks as though we'll have to swim."
     "swim?" said silver. "i don't fancy it, hazel-rah. i know it's no distance, but
look at those banks. the current would take us down before we could get out: and
that means into one of these holes unde

as impossible to see exactly what lay
on the other side of the bridge. the light was failing. water, green leaves, moving
reflections of leaves, the splashing of the raindrops and some curious thing that
appeared to be standing in the water and to be made of vertical gray lines -- these
were all that could be made out. the rain echoed dismally up the culvert. the
hard, ringing noise from under the soffit, so much unlike any sound to be heard
in an earth tunnel, was disturbing. hazel returned to blackberry and silver.
     "this is as bad a fix as we've been in," he said. "we can't stay here, but i can't
see any way out."
     kehaar appeared on the parapet above them, flapped the rain out of his wings
and dropped down to the punt.
     "ees finish poat," he said. "not vait more."
     "but how can we get to the bank, kehaar?" said hazel.
     the gull was surprised. "dog sveem, rat sveem. you no sveem?"

r immediately below the bridge,
with a low, shelving bank where they could get out easily? that seemed too much
to hope for. or did he simply mean that they had better hurry up and take a
chance on being able to do what he himself could do without difficulty? this
seemed more likely. suppose one of them did jump out of the boat and go down
with the current -- what would that tell the others, if he did not come back?
     poor hazel looked about him. silver was licking bigwig's wounded shoulder.
blackberry was fidgeting on and off the thwart, strung up, able to feel only too
clearly all that hazel felt himself. as he still hesitated, kehaar let out a squawk.
     "yark! damn rabbits no goot. vat i do, i show you."
     he tumbled clumsily off the raised bow. there was no gap between the punt
and the dark mouth of the culvert. sitting low in the water like a mallard, he
floated into the tunnel and vanished. peering after him, hazel could at first see
nothing. then he made out kehaar's shape black

it floated into daylight, turned sideways and passed out of the restricted view.
     "what does that prove?" said blackberry, his teeth chattering. "he may have
flown off the surface or put his great webbed feet down. it's not he that's soaked
through and shivering and twice as heavy with wet fur."
     kehaar reappeared on the parapet above.
     "you go now," he said shortly.
     still the wretched hazel hung back. his leg had begun to hurt again. the sight
of bigwig -- bigwig of all rabbits -- at the end of his tether, half unconscious,
playing no part in this desperate exploit, lowered his courage still more. he

re were in fact ten does altogether -- though none of the rabbits
knew the number -- and although one or two responded to bigwig's patient
urging, several were so much exhausted that they remained huddled where they
were, or looked stupidly at the water until others were brought to take their place.
from time to time bigwig would ask one of the bucks to give a lead and in this
way acorn, hawkbit and bluebell all scrambled over the side. the injured doe,
thrayonlosa, was clearly in a bad way and blackberry and thethuthinnang swam
through together, one in front of her and one behind.
     as darkness closed in, the rain stopped. hazel and blackavar went back to the
bank of the pool below the bridge. the sky cleared and the oppression lifted as
the thunder moved away eastward. but it was fu inlé before bigwig himself came
through the bridge with silver and fiver. it was as much as ever he could do to
keep afloat, and when he reached the grating he rolled over in the water, belly
uppermost, like a

t was evidently close to a road busier than any they had known.
soon after daylight they began to hear and smell hrududil passing, not so far
away as the breadth of a small field. there was continual disturbance and the
does in particular were startled and uneasy. thrayonlosa's death made matters
worse. worried by the noise and vibration and unable to feed, the does kept
wandering downstream to look at the body and whisper together about the
strange and dangerous surroundings.
     he consulted blackberry, who pointed out that probably it would not be long
before men found the boat; then very likely several would be close by for some
time. this decided hazel that they had better set out at once and try to reach
somewhere where they could rest more easily. he could hear and smell that the
swamp extended a long way downstream. with the road lying to the south, the
only way seemed to be northward, over the bridge, which was in any case the way
home.
     taking bigwig with him, he climbed the bank

 "i have a great many more rabbits," he said. "the does must stay here. the rest
of you can go. otherwise we shall kill you."
     "very well," said hazel. "bring your whole patrol into the open and we'll do as
you say."
     by this time a considerable number of rabbits was coming up the slope.
campion and his patrol looked at them in silence but made no move.
     "you'd better stay where you are," said hazel at length. "if you try to interfere
with us it will be the worse for you. silver and blackberry, take the does and go
on. the rest of us will join you."
     "hazel-rah," whispered blackavar, "the patrol must be killed -- all of them.
they mustn't report back to the general."
     this had also occurred to hazel. but as he thought of the dreadful fight and the
four efrafans actually torn to pieces -- for that was what it would mean -- he
could not find it in his heart to do it. like bigwig, he felt a reluctant liking for
campion. besides, it would take some doing. quite probably some of h

-- below us in the combe. we wondered what so many rabbits could be doing
there and we were going down to see when we suddenly came face to face with
campion. we looked at him and he looked at us and then i realized what it must
mean and we turned and ran. he didn't follow us -- probably because he'd had no
orders. but how long will it take them to get here?"
     blackavar had returned from underground, bringing silver and blackberry.
     "we ought to leave at once, sir," he said to hazel. "we might be able to get
quite a long way before they come."
     hazel looked about him. "anyone who wants to go can go," he said. "i shan't.
we made this warren ourselves and frith only knows what we've been through on
account of it. i'm not going to leave it now."
     "neither am i," said bigwig. "if i'm for the black rabbit, there's one or two
from efrafa will come with me."
     there was a short silence.

     "no, we must stay," said strawberry. "i believe el-ahrairah will save us from
this woundwort; and if he doesn't, i'm not going back to efrafa, i'll tell you that."
     "fill in the holes," said hazel.
     as the sun set, the rabbits fell to clawing and scrabbling in the runs. the sides
were hard with the hot weather. it was not easy to get started, and when the soil
began to fall, it was light and powdery and did little to block the holes. it was
blackberry who hit upon the idea of working outward from inside the
honeycomb itself, scratching down the ceilings of the runs where they came into
the meeting hall and blocking the holes by breaking the underground walls into
them. one run, leading up into the wood, was left open for coming and going. it
was the one where kehaar used to shelter and the lobby at the mouth was still
cluttered with guano. as hazel passed the place, it occurred to him that
woundwort did not know that kehaar had left them. he

he hall broke up into bays and runs with columns
of earth between. beyond these runs lay several of the warren's burrows. one,
lined with fur torn from her own belly, contained clover and the pile of grass and
leaves, covered over with earth, in which her newborn litter were sleeping.
     "well, we seem to be putting them to a great deal of trouble," said hazel.
"that's all to the good. it'll blunt their claws and i should think they'll be tired out
before they've done. what do you make of it, blackberry?"
     "i'm afraid it's a bad lookout, hazel-rah," replied blackberry. "it's true they're
in trouble up at the top end. there's a lot of ground above us there and the roots
will hold them up for a long time. but down this end it's easier for them. they're
bound to dig through fairly soon. then the roof will come in; and i can't see that
we can do anything to stop them."
     hazel could feel him trembling as he spoke. as the sounds of digging
continued, he sensed fear spreading all through the

he was in the honeycomb, facing bigwig in the dark, across the motionless body
of fiver. the scratching from above was louder and closer.
     "bigwig," said hazel, "do as i say at once, there's a good fellow. we've got
hardly any time. go and get dandelion and blackberry and bring them to me at
the foot of kehaar's run, quickly."
     at the foot of the run buckthorn was still in his place. he had not moved at
fiver's cry, but his breath was short and his pulse very quick. he and the other
three rabbits gathered about hazel without a word.
     "i've got a plan," said hazel. "if it works, it'll finish woundwort for good and
all. but i've no time to explain. every moment counts now. dandelion and

     "but hazel--" said blackberry.
     "as soon as we've gone," said hazel, turning to bigwig, "you're to block this run
and get everyone back behind the wall you've made. if they break in, hold them
up as long as you can. don't give in to them on any account. el-ahrairah has
shown me what to do."
     "but where are you going, hazel?" asked bigwig.
     "to the farm," said hazel, "to gnaw another rope. now, you two, follow me up
the run: and don't forget, you stop for nothing until you're down the hill. if there

     at that moment general woundwort, out on the open grass below the bank,

hours.

field's been cut. don't bother about cover -- just run in the open. keep with me,
though. i'll go as fast as i can."
     they crossed the field easily enough, dandelion running ahead. the only alarm
came when they startled four partridges, which whirred away over the hedge to
the west and sailed down, spread-winged, into the field beyond. soon they
reached the road and hazel halted among the quickset on top of the nearer bank.
     "now, blackberry," he said, "this is where we leave you. lie close and don't
move. when the time comes, don't break too soon. you've got the best head of
any of us. use it -- and keep it, too. when you get back, go to ground in kehaar's
run and stay there till things are safe. have you got your line clear?"
     "yes, hazel-rah," replied blackberry. "but, as far as i can see, i may have to run
from here to the iron tree without a check. there's no cover."
     "i know," said hazel. "it can't be helped. if the w

have to turn for the hedge and then keep popping in and out of it. do whatever

you like. there's no time for us to stay and work it out. only make sure you get
back to the warren. it all depends on you."
     blackberry burrowed his way into the moss and ivy round the base of the
thorn. the other two crossed the road and made uphill toward the sheds beside
the lane.
     "good roots they keep there," said hazel, as they passed them and reached the
hedge. "pity we've no time just now. when this is over we'll have a nice, quiet raid
on the place."
     "i hope we do, hazel-rah," said dandelion. "are you going straight up the lane?
what about cats?"
     "it's the quickest way," said hazel. "that's all that matte

the brute's still asleep. now, dandelion, you
mustn't make any mistake. you lie in the grass just there, opposite the kennel.
when the rope's gnawed through you'll see it fall. unless the dog's ill or deaf, it'll
be alert by then; probably before, i'm afraid, but that's my lookout. it's up to you
to attract it and make it chase you all the way down to the road. you're very fast.
take care it doesn't lose you. use the hedges if you want to; but remember it'll be
trailing the rope. get it down to blackberry. that's all that matters."
     "if we ever meet again, hazel-rah," said dandelion, as he took cover in the
grass verge, "we ought to have the makings of the best story ever."
     "and you'll be the chap to tell it," said hazel. he moved away in a half-circle to
the morning side and reached the wall of the farmhouse. then he began to hop
cautiously along the wall, in and out of the narrow flower bed. his head was a
tumult of smells -- phlox in bloom, ashes, cow dung, dog, cat, hens, stagnant

er the broken end of a board and here he crept into the
field beyond. the dog, following, thrust its head into the gap and pushed, barking
with excitement. gradually the loose board levered open like a trapdoor until it

was able to force its way through.
     now that he had a better start, dandelion kept in the open and ran down the
field to the hedge beside the road. he knew he was slower, but the dog seemed
slower, too. choosing a thick part, he went through the hedge and crossed the
road. blackberry came to meet him, scuttering down the further bank. dandelion
dropped exhausted in the ditch. the dog was not twenty feet away on the other
side of the hedge. it could not find a big enough gap.
     "it's faster than ever i thought," gasped dandelion, "but i've taken the edge off

     it was plain that blackberry was frightened.
     "frith help me!" he whispered. "i'll never do it!"
     "go on, quick," said dandelion, "before it lo

ses interest. i'll overtake you and

     blackberry hopped deliberately into the road and sat up. seeing him, the dog
yelped and thrust its weight against the hedge. blackberry ran slowly along the
road toward a pair of gates that stood opposite each other further down. the dog
stayed level with him. as soon as he was sure that it had seen the gate on its own
side and meant to go to it, blackberry turned and climbed the bank. out in the
stubble he waited for the dog to reappear.
     it was a long time coming; and when at last it pushed its way between the
gatepost and the bank into the field, it paid him no attention. it nosed along the
foot of the bank, put up a partridge and bounced after it and then began to
scratch about in a clump of dock plants. for some time blackberry felt too
terrified to move. then, in desperation, he hopped slowly toward it, trying to act
as though he had not

 noticed that it was there. it dashed after him, but almost at
once seemed to lose interest and returned to its nosing and sniffing over the
ground. finally, when he was utterly at a loss, it set off over the field of its own
accord, padding easily along beside one of the rows of threshed straw, trailing the
broken cord and pouncing in and out at every squeak and rustle. blackberry,
sheltering behind a parallel row, kept level with it. in this manner they covered
the distance to the pylon line, halfway to the foot of the down. it was here that
dandelion caught up with him.
     "it's not fast enough, blackberry! we must get on. bigwig may be dead."
     "i know, but at least it's going the right way. i couldn't get it to move at all, to
start with. can't we--"
     "it's got to come up the down at speed or there'll be no surprise. come on, we'll
draw it together. we'll ha

     although woundwort had shown himself at the last to be a creature virtually
mad, nevertheless what he did proved not altogether futile. there can be little
doubt that if he had not done it, more rabbits would have been killed that
morning on watership down. so swiftly and silently had the dog come up the hill
behind dandelion and blackberry that one of campion's sentries, half asleep
under a tussock after the long night, was pulled down and killed in the instant
that he turned to bolt. later -- after it had left woundwort -- the dog beat up and
down the bank and the open grass for some time, barking and dashing at every
bush and clump of weeds. but by now the efrafans had had time to scatter and
hide, as best they could. besides, the dog, unexpectedly scratched and bitten,
showed a certain reluctance to come to grips. at last, how

only thoughts throughout the warren were for hazel and bigwig. bigwig seemed
likely to die. bleeding in half a dozen places, he lay with closed eyes in the run he
had defended and made no reply when hyzenthlay told him that the efrafans
were defeated and the warren was saved. after a time, they dug carefully to
broaden the run and as the day wore on the does, each in turn, remained beside
him, licking his wounds and listening to his low, unsteady breathing.
     before this, blackberry and dandelion had burrowed their way in from
kehaar's run -- it had not been blocked very heavily -- and told their story. they
could not say what might have happened to hazel after the dog broke loose, and
by the early afternoon everyone feared the worst. at last pipkin, in great anxiety
and distress, insisted on setting out for nuthanger. fiver at once said that he
would go with him and together they left the wood and set off northward over the
down. they had gone only a short distance when f
