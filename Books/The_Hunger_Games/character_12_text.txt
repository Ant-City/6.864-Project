door closes. 
we walk toward the seam in silence. i donâ€™t like that gale 
took a dig at madge, but heâ€™s right, of course. the reaping sys-
tem is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. you be-
come eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. that 
year, your name is entered once. at thirteen, twice. and so on 

13  

 

and so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of 
eligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven times. 
thatâ€™s true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire 
country of panem. 
but hereâ€™s the catch. say you are poor and starving as we 
were. you can opt to add your name more times in exchange 
for tesserae. each tessera is worth a meager yearâ€™s supply of 
grain and oil for one person. you may do this for each of your 
family members as well. so, at the age of twelve, i had my 
name entered four times. once, because i had to, and three 
times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, prim,

that part about her being ill might be true. iâ€™ve seen her

perhaps it is a sickness, but itâ€™s one we canâ€™t afford.

they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but bould-
ers and sand and scruffy bushes. i particularly hated that year. 
many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went 
insane from thirst. 
â€œthereâ€™s almost always some wood,â€ gale says. â€œsince that 
year half of them died of cold. not much entertainment in 
that.â€ 
itâ€™s true. we spent one hunger games watching the players 
freeze to death at night. you could hardly see them because 
they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or 
torches or anything. it was considered very anti-climactic in 
the capitol, all those quiet, bloodless deaths. since then, 
thereâ€™s usually been wood to make fires. 
â€œyes, thereâ€™s usually some,â€ i say.

said, â€˜well, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to 
pearls!â€™â€œ effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice 
but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though 
itâ€™s wrong. 
coal doesnâ€™t turn to pearls. they grow in shellfish. possibly 
she meant coal turns to diamonds, but thatâ€™s untrue, too. iâ€™ve 
heard they have some sort of machine in district 1 that can 
turn graphite into diamonds. but we donâ€™t mine graphite in 
district 12. that was part of district 13â€™s job until they were 
destroyed. 
i wonder if the people sheâ€™s been plugging us to all day ei-
ther know or care.

â€œunfortunately, i canâ€™t seal the sponsor deals for you. only 
haymitch can do that,â€ says effie grimly. â€œbut donâ€™t worry, iâ€™ll 
get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary.â€

is news. but after 
watching him lie so smoothly, i donâ€™t give this much weight. 
â€œreally? well, he likes you and your sister. i think he wishes 
he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys.â€ 
the idea that i might ever have been discussed, around the 
dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in passing in peetaâ€™s house 
gives me a start. it must have been when the mother was out 
of the room. 
â€œhe knew your mother when they were kids,â€ says peeta. 
another surprise. but probably true. â€œoh, yes. she grew up 
in town,â€ i say. it seems impolite to say she never mentioned 
the baker except to compliment his bread. 
weâ€™re at my door. i give back his jacket. â€œsee you in the 
morning then.â€ 
â€œsee you,â€ he says, and walks off down the hall.

when i open my door, the redheaded girl is collecting my 
unitard and boots from where i left them on the floor before 
my shower. i want to apologize for possibly getting her in 
trouble earlier. but i remember iâ€™m n

yes at haymitch. â€œshe has no idea. the ef-
fect she can have.â€ he runs his fingernail along the wood grain 
in the table, refusing to look at me. 
what on earth does he mean? people help me? when we 
were dying of starvation, no one helped me! no one except 
peeta. once i had something to barter with, things changed. 
iâ€™m a tough trader. or am i? what effect do i have? that iâ€™m 
weak and needy? is he suggesting that i got good deals be-
cause people pitied me? i try to think if this is true. perhaps 
some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades, 
but i always attributed that to their long-standing relationship 
with my father. besides, my game is first-class. no one pitied 
me! i glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me. 
after about a minute of this, haymitch says, â€œwell, then. 
well, well, well. katniss, thereâ€™s no guarantee theyâ€™ll be bows 
and arrows in the arena, but during your private session with 
the gamemakers, show them what you can do. until

stares from around the room. 
â€œall right, iâ€™ll keep smiling pleasantly and you talk,â€ says 
peeta. itâ€™s wearing us both out, haymitchâ€™s direction to be 
friendly. because ever since i slammed my door, thereâ€™s been 
a chill in the air between us. but we have our orders. 
â€œdid i ever tell you about the time i was chased by a bear?â€ 
i ask. â€œno, but it sounds fascinating,â€ says peeta. 
i try and animate my face as i recall the event, a true story, 
in which iâ€™d foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights 
to a beehive. peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue. 
heâ€™s much better at this than i am. 
on the second day, while weâ€™re taking a shot at spear 
throwing, he whispers to me. â€œi think we have a shadow.â€ 
i throw my spear, which iâ€™m not too bad at actually, if i 
donâ€™t have to throw too far, and see the little girl from district 
11 standing back a bit, watching us. sheâ€™s the twelve-year-old, 
the one

who reminded me so of prim in stature. up close she 
looks about ten. she has bright, dark, eyes and satiny brown 
skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly ex-
tended to her sides, as if ready to take wing at the slightest 
sound. itâ€™s impossible not to think of a bird. 
i pick up another spear while peeta throws. â€œi think her 
nameâ€™s rue,â€ he says softly.

i bite my lip. rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the 
meadow. rue. primrose. neither of them could tip the scale at 
seventy pounds soaking wet. 
â€œwhat can we do about it?â€ i ask him, more harshly than i 
intended. 
â€œnothing to do,â€ he says back. â€œjust making conversation.â€ 
now that i know sheâ€™s there, itâ€™s hard to ignore the child. 
she slips up and joins us at different stations. like me, sheâ€™s 
clever with plants, climbs swiftly, and has good aim. she can 
hit the target every time with a slingshot. but what is a sling-

â€œall right, katniss,â€ he says tiredly. after that, we only talk 
in front of people. 
on the third day of training, they start to call us out of lunch 
for our private sessions with the gamemakers. district by dis-
trict, first the boy, then the girl tribute. as usual, district 12 is 
slated to go last. we linger in the dining room, unsure where 
else to go. no one comes back once they have left. as the room 
empties, the pressure to appear friendly lightens. by the time 
they call rue, we are left alone. we sit in silence until they 
summon peeta. he rises. 
â€œremember what haymitch said about being sure to throw 
the weights.â€ the words come out of my mouth without per-
mission. 
â€œthanks. i will,â€ he says. â€œyou . . . shoot straight.â€ 
i nod. i donâ€™t know why i said anything at all. although if 
iâ€™m going to lose, iâ€™d rather peeta win than the others. better 
for our district, for my mother and prim. 
after about fifteen minutes, they call my name. i smooth

have any worthwhile effect on the population. people would 
need to know what you did. but they canâ€™t since itâ€™s secret, so 
itâ€™d be a waste of effort,â€ says haymitch. â€œmore likely theyâ€™ll 
make your life hell in the arena.â€ 
â€œwell, theyâ€™ve already promised to do that to us any way,â€ 
says peeta.

â€œvery true,â€ says haymitch. and i realize the impossible has 
happened. they have actually cheered me up. haymitch picks 
up a pork chop with his fingers, which makes effie frown, and 
dunks it in his wine. he rips off a hunk of meat and starts to 
chuckle. â€œwhat were their faces like?â€ 
i can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up. â€œshocked. terri-
fied. uh, ridiculous, some of them.â€ an image pops into my 
mind. â€œone man tripped backward into a bowl of punch.â€

after dinner, we go to sitting room to watch the scores an-
nounced on television. first they show a photo of the tribute, 
then flash their score below it. the career tributes naturally 
get in the eight-to-ten range. most of the other players aver-
age a five. surprisingly, little rue comes up with a seven. i 
donâ€™t know what she showed the judges, but sheâ€™s so tiny it 
must have been impressive. 
district 12 comes up last, as usual. peeta pulls an eight so at 
least a couple of the gamemakers must have been watching 
him. i dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up, 
expecting the worst. then theyâ€™re flashing the number eleven 
on the screen. 
eleven! 
effie trinket lets out a squeal, and everybody is slapping 
me on the back and cheering and congratulating

isnâ€™t absorbent and they skid right of if i try to dry them. 11. 
rue, who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with 
wings, flutters her way to caesar. a hush falls over the crowd 
at the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute. caesarâ€™s very 
sweet with her, complimenting her seven in training, an excel-
lent score for one so small. when he asks her what her great-
est strength in the arena will be, she doesnâ€™t hesitate. â€œiâ€™m 
very hard to catch,â€ she says in a tremulous voice. â€œand if they 
canâ€™t catch me, they canâ€™t kill me. so donâ€™t count

â€œi wouldnâ€™t in a million years,â€ says caesar encouragingly. 
the boy tribute from district 11, thresh, has the same dark 
skin as rue, but the resemblance stops there. heâ€™s one of the 
giants, probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox, but 
i noticed he rejected the invitations from the career tributes 
to join their crowd. instead heâ€™s been very solitary, speaking 
to no one, showing little interest in training. even so, he 
scored a ten and itâ€™s not hard to imagine he impressed the 
gamemakers. he ignores caesarâ€™s attempts at banter and an-
swers with a yes or no or just remains silent.

low, i can see his face now, the awkward way he holds his 
bandaged hands. â€œi really am sorry about your hands.â€ 
â€œit doesnâ€™t matter, katniss,â€ he says. â€œiâ€™ve never been a con-
tender in these games anyway.â€ 
â€œthatâ€™s no way to be thinking,â€ i say. 
â€œwhy not? itâ€™s true. my best hope is to not disgrace myself

â€œand what?â€ i say. 
â€œi donâ€™t know how to say it exactly. only . . . i want to die as

how could he die as anyone but himself? â€œi donâ€™t want them to

much too bright to be building a fire like that.

the capitol, so iâ€™m careful to continue to hide my emotions. 
but what a good time claudius templesmith must be having 
with his guest commentators, dissecting peetaâ€™s behavior, my 
reaction. what to make of it all? has peeta revealed his true 
colors? how does this affect the betting odds? will we lose 
sponsors? do we even have sponsors? yes, i feel certain we 
do, or at least did. 
certainly peeta has thrown a wrench into our star-crossed 
lover dynamic. or has he? maybe, since he hasnâ€™t spoken much 
about me, we can still get some mileage out of it. maybe 
people will think itâ€™s something we plotted together if i seem 
like it amuses me now.

old piece of leather, drying and cracking in the heat. every 
step is an effort, but i refuse to stop. i refuse to sit down. if i 
sit, thereâ€™s a good chance i wonâ€™t be able to get up again, that i 
wonâ€™t even remember my task. 
what easy prey i am! any tribute, even tiny rue, could take 
me right now, merely shove me over and kill me with my own 
knife, and iâ€™d have little strength to resist. but if anyone is in 
my part of the woods, they ignore me. the truth is, i feel a mil-
lion miles from another living soul. 
not alone though. no, theyâ€™ve surely got a camera tracking 
me now. i think back to the years of watching tributes starve, 
freeze, bleed, and dehydrate to death. unless thereâ€™s a really 
good fight going on somewhere, iâ€™m being featured.

district doctor whoâ€™s responsible for treating the miners had 
written him off, told the family to take him home to die. but 
they wouldnâ€™t accept this. he lay on our kitchen table, sense-
less to the world. i got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh, 
gaping, charred flesh, burned clear down to the bone, before i 
ran from the house. i went to the woods and hunted the entire 
day, haunted by the gruesome leg, memories of my fatherâ€™s 
death. whatâ€™s funny was, prim, whoâ€™s scared of her own sha-
dow, stayed and helped. my mother says healers are born, not 
made. they did their best, but the man died, just like the doc-
tor said he would. 
my leg is in need of attention, but i still canâ€™t look at it.

comes from. 
after the war, the capitol destroyed all the nests surround-
ing their city, but the ones near the districts were left un-
touched. another reminder of our weakness, i suppose, just 
like the hunger games. another reason to keep inside the 
fence of district 12. when gale and i come across a tracker 
jacker nest, we immediately head in the opposite direction. 
so is that what hangs above me? i look back to rue for help, 
but sheâ€™s melted into her tree. 
given my circumstances, i guess it doesnâ€™t matter what 
type of wasp nest it is. iâ€™m wounded and trapped. darkness 
has given me a brief reprieve, but by the time the sun rises, 
the careers will have formulated a plan to kill me. thereâ€™s no 
way they could do otherwise after iâ€™ve made them look so

below me, i can see the career pack and peeta asleep on 
the ground. by her position, leaning up against the trunk of 
the tree, iâ€™d guess glimmer was supposed to be on guard, but 
fatigue overcame her. 
my eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me, 
but i canâ€™t make out rue. since she tipped me off, it only seems 
fair to warn her. besides, if iâ€™m going to die today, itâ€™s rue i 
want to win. even if it means a little extra food for my family, 
the idea of peeta being crowned victor is unbearable. 
i call rueâ€™s name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear, 
wide and alert, at once. she points up to the nest again. i hold 
up my knife and make a sawing motion. she nods and disap-
pears. thereâ€™s a rustling in a nearby tree. then the same noise

attack. not glimmer or the girl from district 4. but there was 
the boy from district 1, both tributes from district 2, and pee-

last days must have been as horrid as my own. and what 
about rue? sheâ€™s so small, it wouldnâ€™t take much venom to do 
her in. but then again . . . the tracker jackers wouldâ€™ve had to 
catch her, and she had a good head start. 
a foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water has 
little effect on it. i drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush

around the trunk. â€œyou want me for an ally?â€ 
â€œwhy not? you saved me with those tracker jackers. youâ€™re 
smart enough to still be alive. and i canâ€™t seem to shake you 
anyway,â€ i say. she blinks at me, trying to decide. â€œyou hun-

meat. â€œcome on then, iâ€™ve had two kills today.â€

the few things sheâ€™ll admit pride in. â€œwell, come on, then. fix 
me up.â€ 
i plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal 
the sting on my knee. to my surprise, rue places the handful 
of leaves into her mouth and begins to chew them. my mother 
would use other methods, but itâ€™s not like we have a lot of op-
tions. after a minute or so, rue presses a gloppy green wad of 
chewed leaves and spit on my knee.

stingers out or youâ€™d be a lot worse.â€

rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth, and soon 
iâ€™m laughing because the relief is so sweet. i notice a long burn 
on rueâ€™s forearm. â€œiâ€™ve got something for that.â€ i set aside my 
weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine. 
â€œyou have good sponsors,â€ she says longingly. 
â€œhave you gotten anything yet?â€ i ask. she shakes her head. 
â€œyou will, though. watch. the closer we get to the end, the 
more people will realize how clever you are.â€ i turn the meat 
over. â€œyou werenâ€™t joking, about wanting me for an ally?â€ she 
asks. â€œno, i meant it,â€ i say. i can almost hear haymitch groani

sheâ€™s a survivor, and i trust her, and why not admit it? she 
reminds me of prim. 
â€œokay,â€ she says, and holds out her hand. we shake. â€œitâ€™s a 
deal.â€ of course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, but nei-
ther of us mentions that. 
rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root 
to the meal. roasted over the fire, they have the sharp sweet 
taste of a parsnip. she recognizes the bird, too, some wild

â€œoh,â€ says rue with a sigh. â€œiâ€™ve never had a whole leg to 
myself before.â€ 
iâ€™ll bet she hasnâ€™t. iâ€™ll bet meat hardly ever comes her way. 
â€œtake the other,â€ i say. 
â€œreally?â€ she asks. 
â€œtake whatever you want. now that iâ€™ve got a bow and ar-
rows, i can get more. plus iâ€™ve got snares. i can show you how 
to set them,â€ i say. rue still looks uncertainly at the leg. â€œoh, 
take it,â€ i say, putting the drumstick in her hands. â€œit will only 
keep a few days anyway, and weâ€™ve got the whole bird plus 
the rabbit.â€ once sheâ€™s got hold of it, her appetite wins out and 
she takes a huge mouthful. 
â€œiâ€™d have thought, in district eleven, youâ€™d have a bit more 
to eat than us. you know, since you grow the food,â€ i say. 
rueâ€™s eyes widen. â€œoh, no, weâ€™re not allowed to eat the 
crops.â€ 
â€œthey arrest you

â€œthey whip you and make everyone else watch,â€ says rue. 
â€œthe mayorâ€™s very strict about it.â€ 
i can tell by her expression that itâ€™s not that uncommon an 
occurrence. a public whippingâ€™s a rare thing in district 12, al-
though occasionally one occurs. technically, gale and i could 
be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods â€” well,

the least prestigious, poorest, most ridiculed district in the 
country has its advantages. such as, being largely ignored by 
the capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas. 
â€œdo you get all the coal you want?â€ rue asks. 
â€œno,â€ i answer. â€œjust what we buy and whatever we track in 
on our boots.â€ 
â€œthey feed us a bit extra during harvest, so that people can 
keep going longer,â€ says rue. 
â€œdonâ€™t you have to be in school?â€ i ask. 
â€œnot during harvest. everyone works then,â€ says rue. 
itâ€™s interesting, hearing about her life. we have so little 
communication with anyone outside our district. in fact, i 
wonder if the gamemakers are blocking out our conversation, 
because even though the information seems harmless, they 
donâ€™t want people in different districts to know about one 
another. 
at rueâ€™s suggestion, we lay out all our food to plan ahead.

vide up our food supplies, so in case weâ€™re separated, weâ€™ll 
both be set for a few days. apart from the food, rue has a 
small water skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair of 
socks. she also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife. â€œi 
know itâ€™s not much,â€ she says as if embarrassed, â€œbut i had to 
get away from the cornucopia fast.â€

the sun and they make it harder to see,â€ i say with a shrug. 
â€œthese arenâ€™t for sun, theyâ€™re for darkness,â€ exclaims rue. 
â€œsometimes, when we harvest through the night, theyâ€™ll pass 
out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees. where the 
torchlight doesnâ€™t reach. one time, this boy martin, he tried to 
keep his pair. hid it in his pants. they killed him on the spot.â€ 
â€œthey killed a boy for taking these?â€ i say. 
â€œyes, and everyone knew he was no danger. martin wasnâ€™t 
right in the head. i mean, he still acted like a three-year-old. 
he just wanted the glasses to play with,â€ says rue.

hearing this makes me feel like district 12 is some sort of 
safe haven. of course, people keel over from starvation all the 
time, but i canâ€™t imagine the peacekeepers murdering a sim-
pleminded child. thereâ€™s a little girl, one of greasy saeâ€™s 
grandkids, who wanders around the hob. sheâ€™s not quite right, 
but sheâ€™s treated as a sort of pet. people toss her scraps and 
things.

â€œso what do these do?â€ i ask rue, taking the glasses. 
â€œthey let you see in complete darkness,â€ says rue. â€œtry 
them tonight when the sun goes down.â€ 
i give rue some matches and she makes sure i have plenty 
of leaves in case my stings flare up again. we extinguish our 
fire and head upstream until itâ€™s almost nightfall. 
â€œwhere do you sleep?â€ i ask her. â€œin the trees?â€ she nods.

rue holds up her extra pair of socks. â€œi have these for my

the anthem should block out our words, but still i whisper. i 
even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand. i 
donâ€™t want the audience to know what iâ€™m planning to tell her 
about peeta. taking a cue from me, she does the same.

i donâ€™t answer. if, in fact, peeta did save me, iâ€™m in his debt 
again. and this canâ€™t be paid back. â€œif he did, it was all proba-
bly just part of his act. you know, to make people think heâ€™s in 
love with me.â€ 
â€œoh,â€ says rue thoughtfully. â€œi didnâ€™t think that was an act.â€ 
â€œcourse it is,â€ i say. â€œhe worked it out with our mentor.â€ 
the anthem ends and the sky goes dark. â€œletâ€™s try out these 
glasses.â€ i pull out the glasses and slip them on. rue wasnâ€™t 
kidding. i can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a 
skunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away. i 
could kill it from here if i had a mind to. i could kill anyone. 
â€œi wonder who else got a pair of these,â€ i say.

â€œthe careers have two pairs. but theyâ€™ve got everything 
down by the lake,â€ rue says. â€œand theyâ€™re so strong.â€ 
â€œweâ€™re strong, too,â€ i say. â€œjust in a different way.â€ 
â€œyou are. you can shoot,â€ she says. â€œwhat can i do?â€ 
â€œyou can feed yourself. can they?â€ i ask. 
â€œthey donâ€™t need to. they have all those supplies,â€ rue 
says. â€œsay they didnâ€™t. say the supplies were gone. how long 
would they last?â€ i say. â€œi mean, itâ€™s the hunger games, right?â€ 
â€œbut, katniss, theyâ€™re not hungry,â€ says rue. 
â€œno, theyâ€™re not. thatâ€™s the problem,â€ i agree. and for the 
first time, i have a plan. a plan that isnâ€™t motivated by the 
need for flight and evasion. an offensive plan. â€œi think weâ€™re 
going to have to fix that, rue.â€

about her, as i take no particular precautions. if sheâ€™d wanted 
me dead, all she would have had to do was disappear from 
that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest. needl-
ing me, at the very back of my mind, is the obvious. both of us 
canâ€™t win these games. but since the odds are still against ei-
ther of us surviving, i manage to ignore the thought. 
besides, iâ€™m distracted by my latest idea about the careers 
and their supplies. somehow rue and i must find a way to de-
stroy their food. iâ€™m pretty sure feeding themselves will be a 
tremendous struggle. traditionally, the career tributesâ€™ strat-
egy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there.

pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it, another a gamemakersâ€™

but iâ€™m too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight. 
my wounds recovering, my mind still a bit foggy from the ve-
nom, and the warmth of rue at my side, her head cradled on 
my shoulder, have given me a sense of security. i realize, for 
the first time, how very lonely iâ€™ve been in the arena. how 
comforting the presence of another human being can be. i give 
in to my drowsiness, resolving that tomorrow the tables will 
turn. tomorrow, itâ€™s the careers who will have to watch their 
backs. the boom of the cannon jolts me awake. the skyâ€™s streaked 
with light, the birds already chattering. rue perches in a 
branch across from me

wait, listening for more shots, but there arenâ€™t any. 
â€œwho do you think that was?â€ i canâ€™t help thinking of peeta. 
â€œi donâ€™t know. it could have been any of the others,â€ says 
rue. â€œi guess weâ€™ll know tonight.â€ 
â€œwhoâ€™s left again?â€ i ask. 
â€œthe boy from district one. both tributes from two. the 
boy from three. thresh and me. and you and peeta,â€ says rue. 
â€œthatâ€™s eight. wait, and the boy from ten, the one with the bad 
leg. he makes nine.â€ 
thereâ€™s someone else, but neither of us can remember who 
it is. â€œi wonder how that last one died,â€ says rue. 
â€œno telling. but itâ€™s good for us. a death should hold the 
crowd for a bit. maybe weâ€™ll have time to do something before 
the gamemakers decide things have been moving too slowly,â€ 
i say. â€œwhatâ€™s in your hands?â€

â€œnot sure. thereâ€™s a marshy area over that way. some kind 
of waterbird,â€ she says. 
itâ€™d be nice to cook them, but neither of us wants to risk a 
fire. my guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the 
careers, which means theyâ€™ve recovered enough to be back in 
the games. we each suck out the insides of an egg, eat a rabbit 
leg and some berries. itâ€™s a good breakfast anywhere. 
â€œready to do it?â€ i say, pulling on my pack. 
â€œdo what?â€ says rue, but by the way she bounces up, you 
can tell sheâ€™s up for whatever i propose. 
â€œtoday we take out the careersâ€™ food,â€ i say. 
â€œreally? how?â€ you can see the glint of excitement in her 
eyes. in this way, sheâ€™s exactly the opposite of prim for whom 
adventures are an ordeal. 
â€œno idea. come on, weâ€™ll figure out a plan while we hunt,â€ i 
say. we donâ€™t get much hunting done though because iâ€™m too 
busy getting every scrap of information i can out of rue about

but sheâ€™s observant. they have set up their camp beside the 
lake. their supply stash is about thirty yards away. during the 
day, theyâ€™ve been leaving another tribute, the boy from dis-
trict 3, to watch over the supplies. 
â€œthe boy from district three?â€ i ask. â€œheâ€™s working with 
them?â€ 

208 

 

 

â€œyes, he stays at the camp full-time. he got stung, too, when 
they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake,â€ says rue. â€œi 
guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard. but 
heâ€™s not very big.â€ 
â€œwhat weapons does he have?â€ i ask. 
â€œnot much that i could see. a spear. he might be able to 
hold a few of us off with that, but thresh could kill him easily,â€ 
says rue. 
â€œand the foodâ€™s just out in the open?â€ i say. she nods. 
â€œsomethingâ€™s not quite right about that whole setup.â€ 
â€œi know. but i couldnâ€™t tell what exactly,â€ says rue. â€œkatniss,

â€œburn it. dump it in the lake. soak it in fuel.â€ i poke rue in 
the belly, just like i would prim. â€œeat it!â€ she giggles. â€œdonâ€™t 
worry, iâ€™ll think of something. destroying things is much easi-
er than making them.â€ 
for a while, we dig roots, we gather berries and greens, we 
devise a strategy in hushed voices. and i come to know rue, 
the oldest of six kids, fiercely protective of her siblings, who 
gives her rations to the younger ones, who forages in the 
meadows in a district where the peacekeepers are far less ob-
liging than ours. rue, who when you ask her what she loves 
most in the world, replies, of all things, â€œmusic.â€ 
â€œmusic?â€ i say. in our world, i rank music somewhere be-
tween hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness. at 
least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather. â€œyou have a

â€œwe sing at home. at work, too. thatâ€™s why i love your pin,â€ 
she says, pointing to the mockingjay that iâ€™ve again forgotten 
about. 
â€œyou have mockingjays?â€ i ask. 
â€œoh, yes. i have a few that are my special friends. we can 
sing back and forth for hours. they carry messages for me,â€ 
she says. 
â€œwhat do you mean?â€ i say. 
â€œiâ€™m usually up highest, so iâ€™m the first to see the flag that 
signals quitting time. thereâ€™s a special little song i do,â€ says 
rue. she opens her mouth and sings a little four-note run in a 
sweet, clear voice. â€œand the mockingjays spread it around the 
orchard. thatâ€™s how everyone knows to knock off,â€ she con-
tinues. â€œthey can be dangerous though, if you get too near 
their nests. but you canâ€™t blame them for that.â€ 
i unclasp the pin and hold it out to her. â€œhere, you take it. it 
has more meaning for you than me.â€ 
â€œoh, no,â€ says rue, closing my fingers back over the pin. â€œi 
like to see it on you

â€œwell, itâ€™s worked so far,â€ i say, pinning the mockingjay 
back on my shirt. â€œmaybe you should just stick with that.â€ 
by lunch, we have a plan. by early afternoon, we are poised 
to carry it out. i help rue collect and place the wood for the 
first two campfires, the third sheâ€™ll have time for on her own.

might not work. but if you hear the mockingjays singing it, 
youâ€™ll know iâ€™m okay, only i canâ€™t get back right away.â€ 
â€œare there many mockingjays here?â€ i ask. 
â€œhavenâ€™t you seen them? theyâ€™ve got nests everywhere,â€ 
she says. i have to admit i havenâ€™t noticed.

â€œyou be careful,â€ she says to me. 
â€œyou, too,â€ i say. i turn and head back to the stream, feeling 
somehow worried. about rue being killed, about rue not be-
ing killed and the two of us being left for last, about leaving 
rue alone, about leaving prim alone back home. no, prim has 
my mother and gale and a baker who has promised she wonâ€™t

the place i initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack.

reach the shallow stretch where i took my bath in just a few 
hours. i stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to 
my backpack. it seems bent on reverting to orange no matter 
how many times i cover it. 
my proximity to the careersâ€™ camp sharpens my senses, 
and the closer i get to them, the more guarded i am, pausing 
frequently to listen for unnatural sounds, an arrow already fit-
ted into the string of my bow. i donâ€™t see any other tributes, 
but i do notice some of the things rue has mentioned. patches 
of the sweet berries. a bush with the leaves that healed my 
stings. clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the 
tree i was trapped in. and here and there, the black-and-white 
flash of a mockingjay wing in the branches high over my head. 
when i reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot, i 
pause a moment, to gather my courage. rue has given specific 
instructions on how to reach the best spying place near the 
lake from this point. remember, i tel

admire her cleverness. itâ€™s right at the edge of the wood, but 
the bushy foliage is so thick down low i can easily observe the 
career camp without being spotted. between us lies the flat 
expanse where the games began. 
there are four tributes. the boy from district 1, cato and 
the girl from district 2, and a scrawny, ashen-skinned boy 
who must be from district 3. he made almost no impression 
on me at all during our time in the capitol.

 supplies is not going to be as 
simple as it looks. some other factor is at play here, and iâ€™d 
better stay put until i figure out what it is. my guess is the py-
ramid is booby-trapped in some manner. i think of concealed 
pits, descending nets, a thread that when broken sends a poi-
sonous dart into your heart. really, the possibilities are end-
less. while i am mulling over my options, i hear cato shout out. 
heâ€™s pointing up to the woods, far beyond me, and without 
turning i know that rue must have set the first campfire. weâ€™d 
made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke 
noticeable. the careers begin to arm themselves at once. 
an argument breaks out. itâ€™s loud enough for me to hear 
that it concerns whether or not the boy from district 3 should 
stay or accompany them. 
â€œheâ€™s coming. we need him in the woods, and his jobâ€™s done 
here anyway. no one can touch those supplies,â€ says cato. 
â€œwhat about lover boy?â€ says the boy from district 1. 
â€œi kee

in no shape to raid us,â€ says cato. 
so peeta is out there in the woods, wounded badly. but i am 
still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the careers. 

214 

 

 

â€œcome on,â€ says cato. he thrusts a spear into the hands of 
the boy from district 3, and they head off in the direction of 
the fire. the last thing i hear as they enter the woods is cato 
saying, â€œwhen we find her, i kill her in my own way, and no 
one interferes.â€ 
somehow i donâ€™t think heâ€™s talking about rue. she didnâ€™t 
drop a nest of tracker jackers on him. 
i stay put for a half an hour or so, trying to figure out what 
to do about the supplies. the one advantage i have with the 
bow and arrow is distance. i could send a flaming arrow into 
the pyramid easily enough â€” iâ€™m a good enough shot to get it 
through those openings in the net â€” but thereâ€™s no guarantee 
it would catch. more likely itâ€™d just burn itself out and then 
what? iâ€™d have achieved nothing and given them far too mu

information about myself. that i was here, that i have an ac-
complice, that i can use the bow and arrow with accuracy. 
thereâ€™s no alternative. iâ€™m going to have to get in closer and 
see if i canâ€™t discover what exactly protects the supplies. in 
fact, iâ€™m just about to reveal myself when a movement catches 
my eye. several hundred yards to my right, i see someone 
emerge from the woods. for a second, i think itâ€™s rue, but then 
i recognize foxface â€” sheâ€™s the one we couldnâ€™t remember 
this morning â€” creeping out onto the plain. when she decides 
itâ€™s safe, she runs for the pyramid, with quick, small steps. just 
before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been lit-
tered around the pyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and 
carefully places her feet on a spot. then she begins to ap-
proach the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes land-

disturb the others? thereby protecting the supplies but ensur-
ing the death of the invader. even if i only blew up one mine, 
iâ€™d draw the careers back down on me for sure. and anyway, 
what am i thinking? thereâ€™s that net, clearly strung to deflect 
any such attack. besides, what iâ€™d really need is to throw

about thirty rocks in there at once, setting off a big chain reac-

i glance back up at the woods. the smoke from rueâ€™s 
second fire is wafting toward the sky. by now, the careers 
have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick. time is 
running out. 
there is a solution to this, i know there is, if i can only focus 
hard enough. i stare at the pyramid, the bins, the crates, too 
heavy to topple over with an arrow. maybe one contains cook-
ing oil, and the burning arrow idea is reviving when i realize i 
could end up losing all twelve of my arrows and not get a di-
rect hit on an oil bin, since iâ€™d just

positively, i am live on every screen in panem. 
no blood trails, i tell myself, and manage to pull my hood up 
over my head, tie the cord under my chin with uncooperative 
fingers. that should help soak up the blood. i canâ€™t walk, but 
can i crawl? i move forward tentatively. yes, if i go very slow-

my only hope is to make it back to rueâ€™s copse and conceal 
myself in greenery. i canâ€™t get caught out here on my hands 
and knees in the open. not only will i face death, itâ€™s sure to be 
a long and painful one at catoâ€™s hand. the thought of prim 
having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way to-
ward the hideout.

off by some collapsing crate. this happens twice more. iâ€™m

predators â€” fresh blood is bad enough â€” i make a good meal 
out of the greens and roots and berries rue and i gathered to-

has shown weâ€™re both alive.

now there are two of us. although from what cato said, pee-

didnâ€™t he just lose his entire stash of supplies? 
let the seventy-fourth hunger games begin, cato, i think. let 
a cold breeze has sprung up. i reach for my sleeping bag 
before i remember i left it with rue. i was supposed to pick up 
another one, but what with the mines and all, i forgot. i begin 
to shiver. since roosting overnight in a tree isnâ€™t sensible an-
yway, i scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover myself 
with leaves and pine needles. iâ€™m still freezing. i lay my sheet 
of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to 
block the wind. itâ€™s a little better. i begin to have more sympa-

foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back. with that 
in mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. but sheâ€™s 
heard something, not me, because her head turns away, to-
ward the drop-off, and she sprints for the woods. i wait. no 
one, nothing shows up. still, if foxface thought it was danger-
ous, maybe itâ€™s time for me to get out of here, too. besides, iâ€™m 
eager to tell rue about the pyramid. 
since iâ€™ve no idea where the careers are, the route back by 
the stream seems as good as any. i hurry, loaded bow in one

woods. and the third fire she was supposed to set â€” although 
i forgot to check for it last night â€” was the farthest from our 
site of all. sheâ€™s probably just being cautious about making her

for me to do but wait. 
i wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my ev-

use a bit of medicine on them anyway. the main thing to wor-

second fish. it isnâ€™t going to last long in this hot sun, but it 
should be easy enough to spear a few more for rue. if she 
would just show up. 
feeling too vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided 
hearing, i scale a tree to wait. if the careers show up, this will 
be a fine place to shoot them from. the sun moves slowly. i do 
things to pass the time. chew leaves and apply them to my 
stings that are deflated but still tender. comb through my 
damp hair with my fingers and braid it. lace my boots back 
up. check over my bow and remaining nine arrows. test my 
left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rust

looking for her. i can at least visit the spot where she set the 
third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts. 
before i go, i scatter a few mint leaves around our old 
campfire. since we gathered these some distance away, rue 
will understand iâ€™ve been here, while theyâ€™ll mean nothing to 
the careers.

wood has been neatly arranged, expertly interspersed with 
tinder, but it has never been lit. rue set up the fire but never 
made it back here. somewhere between the second column of 
smoke i spied before i blew up the supplies and this point, she 
ran into trouble. 
i have to remind myself sheâ€™s still alive. or is she? could the 
cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee 
hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken 
to pick it up? will she appear in the sky tonight? no, i refuse to

itâ€™s a relief to be doing something after sitting around all af-

conceal me. but nothing seems suspicious. thereâ€™s no sign of 
any kind of struggle, no disruption of the needles on the 
ground. iâ€™ve stopped for just a moment when i hear it. i have 
to cock my head around to the side to be sure, but there it is 
again. rueâ€™s four-note tune coming out of a mockingjayâ€™s

itâ€™s a childâ€™s scream, a young girlâ€™s scream, thereâ€™s no one in 
the arena capable of making that sound except rue. and now 
iâ€™m running, knowing this may be a trap, knowing the three 
careers may be poised to attack me, but i canâ€™t help myself. 
thereâ€™s another high-pitched cry, this time my name. â€œkatniss! 
katniss!â€ 
â€œrue!â€ i shout back, so she knows iâ€™m near. so, they know 
iâ€™m near, and hopefully the girl who has attacked them with 
tracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still canâ€™t explain 
will be enough to pull their attention away from her. â€œrue! iâ€™m 
coming!â€ when i break into the clearing, sheâ€™s on the ground, hope-
lessly entangled in a net. she just has time to reach her hand 
through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters 
her body.

â€œare there more? are there more?â€ 
she has to say no several times before i hear it. rue has 
rolled to her side, her body curved in and around the spear. i 
shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife, freeing 
her from the net. one look at the wound and i know itâ€™s far 
beyond my capacity to heal, beyond anyoneâ€™s probably. the 
spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach. i crouch 
before her, staring helplessly at the embedded weapon. 
thereâ€™s no point in comforting words, in telling her sheâ€™ll be

her, pulling her head onto my lap. i gently brush the dark, 
thick hair back behind her ear.

leaves. for several hours, i remain motionless. as usual, itâ€™s 
the thought of primâ€™s anxious face as she watches me on the 
screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy. 
i give myself a series of simple commands to follow, like 
â€œnow you have to sit up, katniss. now you have to drink wa-

â€œnow you have to sort the packs, katniss.â€

skin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of rabbit, her extra 
socks, and her slingshot. the boy from district 1 has several 
knives, two spare spearheads, a flashlight, a small leather 
pouch, a first-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried 
fruit. a pack of dried fruit! out of all he might have chosen 
from. to me, this is a sign of extreme arrogance. why bother 
to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp?

after i climb down the tree, i conceal the boyâ€™s knives and

i doubt they think peeta has lit this signal fire. catoâ€™s sure 
heâ€™s as good as dead. i find myself wishing i could tell peeta 
about the flowers i put on rue. that i now understand what 
he was trying to say on the roof. perhaps if he wins the games, 
heâ€™ll see me on victorâ€™s night, when they replay the highlights 
of the games on a screen over the stage where we did our in-
terviews. the winner sits in a place of honor on the platform, 
surrounded by their support crew. 
but i told rue iâ€™d be there. for both of us. and somehow 
that seems even more important than the vow i gave prim. 
i really think i stand a chance of doing it now. winning.

itâ€™s 
not just having the arrows or outsmarting the careers a few 
times, although those things help. something happened when 
i was holding rueâ€™s hand, watching the life drain out of her. 
now i am determined to revenge her, to make her loss unfor-
gettable, and i can only do that by winning and thereby mak-
ing myself unforgettable. 
i overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot, 
but no one does. maybe the other tributes are out there beat-
ing one another senseless. which would be fine, ever since the

eventually, i wrap up my food and go back to the stream

ing rue speared, my arrow piercing the boyâ€™s neck. i donâ€™t 
know why i should even care about the boy.

then i realize . . . he was my first kill. 
along with other statistics they report to help people place 
their bets, every tribute has a list of kills. i guess technically 
iâ€™d get credited for glimmer and the girl from district 4, too, 
for dumping that nest on them. but the boy from district 1 
was the first person i knew would die because of my actions.

name i donâ€™t even know. somewhere his family is weeping for 
him. his friends call for my blood. maybe he had a girlfriend 
who really believed he would come back . . . 
but then i think of rueâ€™s still body and iâ€™m able to banish

pools. but youâ€™d really be a sitting duck at one of those. and 
the stream. the one that leads from the camp rue and i made 
all the way down near the lake and beyond. if he stuck to the 
stream, he could change his location and always be near wa-
ter. he could walk in the current and erase any tracks. he 
might even be able to get a fish or two. 
well, itâ€™s a place to start, anyway. 
to confuse my enemiesâ€™ minds, i start a fire with plenty of 
green wood. even if they think itâ€™s a ruse, i hope theyâ€™ll decide 
iâ€™m hidden somewhere near it. while in reality, iâ€™ll be tracking

 him. besides, if i get him in, who knows if iâ€™d ever be 
able to get him out? 
â€œno more rolling?â€ he asks. 
â€œthatâ€™s all done. letâ€™s get you cleaned up. keep an eye on 
the woods for me, okay?â€ i say. itâ€™s hard to know where to 
start. he so caked with mud and matted leaves, i canâ€™t even 
see his clothes. if heâ€™s wearing clothes. the thought makes me 
hesitate a moment, but then i plunge in. naked bodies are no 
big deal in the arena, right? 
iâ€™ve got two water bottles and rueâ€™s water skin. i prop them 
against rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while 
i pour the third over peetaâ€™s body. it takes a while, but i finally 
get rid of enough mud to find his clothes. i gently unzip his 
jacket, unbutton his shirt and ease them off him. his under-
shirt is so plastered into his wounds i have to cut it away with 
my knife and drench him again to work it loose. heâ€™s badly 
bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker 
jacker stings, if you

the wound does look better. now that the swelling has 
gone down, i can see how deep catoâ€™s sword cut. right down 
to the bone. 
â€œwhat next, dr. everdeen?â€ he asks. 
â€œmaybe iâ€™ll put some of the burn ointment on it. i think it 
helps with infection anyway. and wrap it up?â€ i say. i do and 
the whole thing seems a lot more manageable, covered in 
clean white cotton. although, against the sterile bandage, the 
hem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with conta-
gion. i pull out rueâ€™s backpack. â€œhere, cover yourself with this 
and iâ€™ll wash your shorts.â€ 
â€œoh, i donâ€™t care if you see me,â€ says peeta. 
â€œyouâ€™re just like the rest of my family,â€ i say. â€œi care, all 
right?â€ i turn my back and look at the stream until the under-
shorts splash into the current. he must be feeling a bit better 
if he can throw. 
â€œyou know, youâ€™re kind of squeamish for such a lethal per-
son,â€ says peeta as i beat the shorts clean between two rocks.

than when i was alone. tethered to the ground, on guard, with 
a very sick person to take care of. but i knew he was injured. 
and still i came after him. iâ€™m just going to have to trust that 
whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one. 
when the sky turns rosy, i notice the sheen of sweat on 
peetaâ€™s lip and discover the fever has broken. heâ€™s not back to 
normal, but itâ€™s come down a few degrees. last night, when i 
was gathering vines, i came upon a bush of rueâ€™s berries. i 
strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold wa-
ter. peetaâ€™s struggling to get up when i reach the cave. â€œi woke 
up and you were gone,â€ he says. â€œi was worried about you.â€ 
i have to laugh as i ease him back down. â€œyou were worried 
about me? have you taken a look at yourself lately?â€ 
â€œi thought cato and clove might have found you. they like 
to hunt at night,â€ he says, still serious. 
â€œclove? which one is that?â€ i ask.

s by the stream gives me an idea though. maybe i wonâ€™t 
need to light a fire. 
i settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream 
and the cave. after purifying half a pot of water, i place it in 
direct sunlight and add several egg-size hot stones to the wa-
ter. iâ€™m the first to admit iâ€™m not much of a cook. but since 
soup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting, 
itâ€™s one of my better dishes. i mince groosling until itâ€™s practi-
cally mush and mash some of rueâ€™s roots. fortunately, theyâ€™ve

up. already, between the sunlight and the rocks, the waterâ€™s 
warm. i put in the meat and roots, swap in fresh rocks, and go 
find something green to spice it up a little. before long, i dis-
cover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks. per-

the rocks again, put on the lid, and let the whole thing stew.

ve seen very few signs of game around, but i donâ€™t feel 
comfortable leaving peeta alone while i hunt, so i rig half a 
dozen snares and hope i get lucky. i wonder about the other 
tributes, how theyâ€™re managing now that their main source of 
food has been blown up. at least three of them, cato, clove, 
and foxface, had been relying on it. probably not thresh 
though. iâ€™ve got a feeling he must share some of rueâ€™s know-
ledge on how to feed yourself from the earth. are they fighting 
each other? looking for us? maybe one of them has located us 
and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. the idea 
sends me back to the cave. 
peetaâ€™s stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the 
shade of the rocks. although he brightens a bit when i come 
in, itâ€™s clear he feels miserable. i put cool cloths on his head, 
but they warm up almost as soon as they touch his skin. 
â€œdo you want anything?â€

gin final preparations. iâ€™m careful to leave peeta with water 
and the medical kit right beside him. nothing else will be of 
much use if i donâ€™t return, and even these would only prolong 
his life a short time. after some debate, i strip him of his jacket

and zip it on over my own. he doesnâ€™t need it. not now in the 
sleeping bag with his fever, and during the day, if iâ€™m not there 
to remove it, heâ€™ll be roasting in it. my hands are already stiff 
from cold, so i take rueâ€™s spare pair of socks, cut holes for my 
fingers and thumbs, and pull them on. it helps anyway. i fill 
her small pack with some food, a water bottle, and bandages, 
tuck the knife in my belt, get my bow and arrows. iâ€™m about to 
leave when i remember the importance of sustaining the star-
crossed lover routine and i lean over and give peeta a long, 
lingering kiss. i imagine the teary sighs emanating from the 
capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own. then i

slightly more ominous versions of themselves to take their

places. i donâ€™t try anything tricky, like taking a new route. i 
make my way back up the stream and follow the same path 
back to rueâ€™s hiding place near the lake. along the way, i see 
no sign of another tribute, not a puff of breath, not a quiver of 
a branch. either iâ€™m the first to arrive or the others positioned 
themselves last night. thereâ€™s still more than an hour, maybe 
two, when i wriggle into the underbrush and wait for the 
blood to begin to flow. 
i chew a few mint leaves, my stomach isnâ€™t up for much 
more. thank goodness, i have peetaâ€™s jacket as well as my 
own. if not, iâ€™d be forced to move aroun

the truth. since no peeta appears to save me, she turns back to 
me. â€œliar,â€ she says with a grin. â€œheâ€™s nearly dead. cato knows 
where he cut him. youâ€™ve probably got him strapped up in 
some tree while you try to keep his heart going. whatâ€™s in the 
pretty little backpack? that medicine for lover boy? too bad 
heâ€™ll never get it.â€ 
clove opens her jacket. itâ€™s lined with an impressive array 
of knives. she carefully selects an almost dainty-looking num-
ber with a cruel, curved blade. â€œi promised cato if he let me 
have you, iâ€™d give the audience a good show.â€ 
iâ€™m struggling now in an effort to unseat her, but itâ€™s no use. 
sheâ€™s too heavy and her lock on me too tight. 
â€œforget it, district twelve. weâ€™re going to kill you. just like 
we did your pathetic little ally . . . what was her name? the 
one who hopped around in the trees? rue? well, first rue, 
then you, and then i think weâ€™ll just let nature take care of 
lover boy. how does that

 a moment, she surveys my face, tilting it 
from side to side as if itâ€™s a block of wood and sheâ€™s deciding 
exactly what pattern to carve on it. i attempt to bite her hand, 
but she grabs the hair on the top of my head, forcing me back 
to the ground. â€œi think . . .â€ she almost purrs. â€œi think weâ€™ll start 
with your mouth.â€ i clamp my teeth together as she teasingly 
traces the outline of my lips with the tip of the blade.

i wonâ€™t close my eyes. the comment about rue has filled 
me with fury, enough fury i think to die with some dignity. as 
my last act of defiance, i will stare her down as long as i can 
see, which will probably not be an extended period of time, 
but i will stare her down, i will not cry out. i will die, in my 
own small way, undefeated.

more. want to blow lover boy one last kiss?â€ she asks, i work

itâ€™s not bleeding, but i can see the dent in her skull and i know 
that sheâ€™s a goner. thereâ€™s still life in her now though, in the 
rapid rise and fall of her chest, the low moan escaping her lips. 
when thresh whirls around on me, the rock raised, i know 
itâ€™s no good to run. and my bow is empty, the last loaded ar-
row having gone in cloveâ€™s direction. iâ€™m trapped in the glare 
of his strange golden brown eyes. â€œwhatâ€™d she mean? about 
rue being your ally?â€ 
â€œi â€” i â€” we teamed up. blew up the supplies. i tried to 
save her, i did. but he got there first. district one,â€ i say. may-

trails. either threshâ€™s or mine. iâ€™m seized with terror, weak 
from my head wound, shaking. i load an arrow, but cato can 
throw that spear almost as far as i can shoot. 
only one thing calms me down. thresh has catoâ€™s backpack 
containing the thing he needs desperately. if i had to bet, cato 
headed out after thresh, not me. still i donâ€™t slow down when 
i reach the water. i plunge right in, boots still on, and flounder 
downstream. i pull off rueâ€™s socks that iâ€™ve been using for 
gloves and press them into my forehead, trying to staunch the 
flow of blood, but theyâ€™re soaked in minutes. 
somehow i make it back to the cave. i squeeze through the 
rocks. in the dappled light, i pull the little orange backpack 
from my arm, cut open the clasp, and dump the contents on 
the ground. one slim box containing one hypodermic needle. 
without hesitating, i jam the needle into peetaâ€™s arm and 
slowly press down on the plunger.

â€œi know cloveâ€™s dead. i saw it in the sky last night,â€ h says. 
â€œdid you kill her?â€ 
â€œno. thresh broke her skull with a rock,â€ i say. 
â€œlucky he didnâ€™t catch you, too,â€ says peeta. 
the memory of the feast returns full-force and i feel sick. 
â€œhe did. but he let me go.â€ then, of course, i have to tell him. 
about things iâ€™ve kept to myself because he was too sick to ask 
and i wasnâ€™t ready to relive anyway. like the explosion and 
my ear and rueâ€™s dying and the boy from district 1 and the 
bread. all of which leads to what happened with thresh and 
how he was paying off a debt of sorts. 
â€œhe let you go because he didnâ€™t want to owe you any-
thing?â€ asks peeta in disbelief. 
â€œyes. i donâ€™t expect you to understand it. youâ€™ve always had 
enough. but if youâ€™d lived in the seam, i wouldnâ€™t have to ex-

else to die. but this is absolutely not the kind of thing that vic-
tors go around saying in the arena. despite my best efforts, i 
can feel tears starting to pool in my eyes.

braids instead of one. my father pointed you out when we 
were waiting to line up,â€ peeta says. 
â€œyour father? why?â€ i ask. 
â€œhe said, â€˜see that little girl? i wanted to marry her mother, 
but she ran off with a coal miner,â€™â€ peeta says. 
â€œwhat? youâ€™re making that up!â€ i exclaim. 
â€œno, true story,â€ peeta says. â€œand i said, â€˜a coal miner? why 
did she want a coal miner if she couldâ€™ve had you?â€™ and he 
said, â€˜because when he sings . . . even the birds stop to listen.â€™â€ 
â€œthatâ€™s true. they do. i mean, they did,â€ i say. iâ€™m stunned 
and surprisingly moved, thinking of the baker telling this to

father and the birds. and i did sing the first day of school, al-
though i donâ€™t remember the song. and that red plaid dress . . . 
there was one, a hand-me-down to prim that got washed to 
rags after my fatherâ€™s death. 
it would explain another thing, too. why peeta took a beat-
ing to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. so, if those 
details are true . . . could it all be true? 
â€œyou have a . . . remarkable memory,â€ i say haltingly.

â€œwell, i donâ€™t have much competition here,â€ he says.

about the task at hand. thresh dead. i should be happy, right?

i give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my 
hands, hugging them close to my body. i have to bury the real 
pain because whoâ€™s going to bet on a tribute who keeps snive-
ling over the deaths of her opponents. rue was one thing. we 
were allies. she was so young. but no one will understand my 
sorrow at threshâ€™s murder. the word pulls me up short. mur-

didnâ€™t win . . . i wanted thresh to. because he let me go. and 
because of rue.â€ 
â€œyeah, i know,â€ says peeta. â€œbut this means weâ€™re one step 
closer to district twelve.â€ he nudges a plate of foot into my 
hands. â€œeat. itâ€™s still warm.â€ 
i take a bite of the stew to show i donâ€™t really care, but itâ€™s 
like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow. â€œit 
also means cato will be back hunting us.â€ 
â€œand heâ€™s got supplies again,â€ says peeta. 
â€œheâ€™ll be wounded, i bet,â€ i say. 
â€œwhat makes you say that?â€ peeta asks.

â€ 
â€œme, too,â€ i admit. â€œbut not tonight.â€ 
we finish our food in silence and then peeta offers to take 
the first watch. i burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him, 
pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras. i 
just need a few moments of privacy where i can let any emo-
tion cross my face without being seen. under the hood, i si-
lently say good-bye to thresh and thank him for my life. i 
promise to remember him and, if i can, do something to help 
his family and rueâ€™s, if i win. then i escape into sleep, com-
forted by a full belly and the steady warmth of peeta beside 
me. when peeta wakes me later, the first thing i register is the 
smell of goat cheese. heâ€™s holding out half a roll spread with 
the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices. â€œdonâ€™t be 
mad,â€ he says. â€œi had to eat again. hereâ€™s your half.â€ 
â€œoh, good,â€ i say, immediately taking a huge bite. the 
strong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind prim makes, the

â€œtoo expensive for my family to eat. unless itâ€™s gone very 
stale. of course, practically everything we eat is stale,â€ says 
peeta, pulling the sleeping bag up around him. in less than a 
minute, heâ€™s snoring.

huh. i always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life. 
and itâ€™s true, peeta has always had enough to eat. but 
thereâ€™s something kind of depressing about living your life on 
stale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no one else wanted. one 
thing about us, since i bring our food home on a daily basis, 
most of it is so fresh you have to make sure it isnâ€™t going to 
make a run for it. 
somewhere during my shift, the rain stops not gradually 
but all at once. the downpour ends and thereâ€™s only the resi-
dual drippings of water from branches, the rush of the no

home. 
â€œyes,â€ i say patiently. â€œi will, too. that way weâ€™ll both be 
quieter.â€ like i was making any noise. so we both strip off our 
boots and socks and, while thereâ€™s some improvement, i could 
swear heâ€™s making an effort to snap every branch we encoun-
ter. needless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my 
old camp with rue, iâ€™ve shot nothing. if the stream would set-
tle down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too 
strong. as we stop to rest and drink water, i try to work out a 
solution. ideally, iâ€™d dump peeta now with some simple root-
gathering chore and go hunt, but then heâ€™d be left with only a 
knife to defend himself against catoâ€™s spears and superior 
strength. so what iâ€™d really like is to try and conceal him 
somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him.

work. 
â€œwhat if you show me whatâ€™s edible around here and go get 
us some meat?â€ he says, mimicking my tone. â€œjust donâ€™t go far, 
in case you need help.â€ 
i sigh and show him some roots to dig. we do need food, no 
question. one apple, two rolls, and a blob of cheese the size of 
a plum wonâ€™t last long. iâ€™ll just go a short distance and hope 
cato is a long way off. 
i teach him a bird whistle â€” not a melody like rueâ€™s but a 
simple two-note whistle â€” which we can use to communicate 
that weâ€™re all right. fortunately, heâ€™s good at this. leaving him 
with the pack, i head off. 
i feel like iâ€™m eleven again, tethered not to the safety of the 
fence but to peeta, allowing myself twenty, maybe thirty yards 
of hunting space. away from him though, the woods come 
alive with animal sounds. reassured by his periodic whistles, i 
allow myself to drift farther away, and soon have two rabbits

agree on a signal, they stay in range. because if one of them 
doesnâ€™t answer, theyâ€™re in trouble, all right?â€

and open a fresh bottle of water, although i still have some in 
mine. but iâ€™m not ready to forgive him. i notice the food. the 
rolls and apples are untouched, but someoneâ€™s definitely 
picked away part of the cheese. â€œand you ate without me!â€ i 
really donâ€™t care, i just want something else to be mad about. 
â€œwhat? no, i didnâ€™t,â€ peeta says. 
â€œoh, and i suppose the apples ate the cheese,â€

â€œi donâ€™t know what ate the cheese,â€ peeta says slowly and 
distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, â€œbut it wasnâ€™t me. 
iâ€™ve been down by the stream collecting berries. would you 
care for some?â€ 
i would actually, but i donâ€™t want to relent too soon. i do 
walk over and look at them. iâ€™ve never seen this type before. 
no, i have. but not in the arena. these arenâ€™t rueâ€™s berries, al-
though they resemble them. nor do they match any i learned 
about in training. i lean down and scoop up a few, rolling them 
between my fingers. 
my fatherâ€™s voice comes back to me. â€œnot these, katniss. 
never these. theyâ€™re nightlock. youâ€™ll be dead before they 
reach your stomach.â€

â€œmaybe thatâ€™s what heâ€™s waiting for. what do you want to do? 
go back to the cave?â€ 
â€œeither that or find a tree. but letâ€™s give him another half an 
hour or so. then weâ€™ll take cover,â€ i answer. 
we sit by the lake, in full sight. thereâ€™s no point in hiding 
now. in the trees at the edge of the plain, i can see the mock-
ingjays flitting about. bouncing melodies back and forth be-
tween them like brightly colored balls. i open my mouth and 
sing out rueâ€™s four-note run. i can feel them pause curiously at 
the sound of my voice, listening for more. i repeat the notes in 
the silence. first one mockingjay trills the tune back, then 
another. then the whole world comes alive with the sound. 
â€œjust like your father,â€ says peeta.

my fingers find the pin on my shirt. â€œthatâ€™s rueâ€™s song,â€ i 
say. â€œi think they remember it.â€ 
the music swells and i recognize the brilliance of it. as the 
notes overlap, they compliment

one another, forming a lovely, 
unearthly harmony. it was this sound then, thanks to rue, that 
sent the orchard workers of district 11 home each night. does 
someone start it at quitting time, i wonder, now that she is 
dead? for a while, i just close my eyes and listen, mesmerized by 
the beauty of the song. then something begins to disrupt the 
music. runs cut off in jagged, imperfect lines. dissonant notes 
intersperse with the melody. the mockingjaysâ€™ voices rise up 
in a shrieking cry of alarm. 
weâ€™re on our feet, peeta wielding his knife, me poised to 
shoot, when cato s

â€œitâ€™s her!â€ i get out.

â€œwho?â€ asks peeta. 
my head snaps from side to side as i examine the pack, tak-
ing in the various sizes and colors. the small one with the red 
coat and amber eyes . . . foxface! and there, the ashen hair and 
hazel eyes of the boy from district 9 who died as we struggled 
for the backpack! and worst of all, the smallest mutt, with 
dark glossy fur, huge brown eyes and a collar that reads 11 in 
woven straw. teeth bared in hatred. rue . . . 
â€œwhat is it, katniss?â€ peeta shakes my shoulder. 
â€œitâ€™s them. itâ€™s all of them. the others. rue and foxface and . 
. . all of the other tributes,â€ i choke out. 
i hear peetaâ€™s gasp of recognition. â€œwhat did they do to 
them? you donâ€™t think . . . those could be their real eyes?â€ 
their eyes are the least of my worries. what about their 
brains? have they been given any of the real tributes memo-
ries? have they been programmed to hate our faces particu-
larly because

â€œi think itâ€™s the best yet,â€ i say. when i manage to pull my 
eyes away from the flickering fabric, iâ€™m in for something of a 
shock. my hairâ€™s loose, held back by a simple hairband. the 
makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. a 
clear polish coats my nails. the sleeveless dress is gathered at 
my ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the pad-

knees. without heels, you can see my true stature. i look, very 
simply, like a girl. a young one. fourteen at the most. inno-
cent. harmless. yes, it is shocking that cinna has pulled this off 
when you remember iâ€™ve just won the games. 
this is a very calculated look. nothing cinna designs is ar-
bitrary. i bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation. 
â€œi thought itâ€™d be something more . . . sophisticated-
looking,â€ i say. 
â€œi thought peeta would like this better,â€ he answers careful-
ly. peeta? no, itâ€™s not about p

whole bodyâ€™s shaking like a leaf. hopefully, it will be put down 
to excitement. after all, itâ€™s my night. 
the damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to 
choke me. a cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and i 
canâ€™t rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head 
are about to collapse, to bury me alive under the rubble. when 
i left the arena, when the trumpets played, i was supposed to 
be safe. from then on. for the rest of my life. but if what hay-
mitch says is true, and heâ€™s got no reason to lie, iâ€™ve never 
been in such a dangerous place in my life. 
itâ€™s so much worse than being hunted in the arena. there, i

gale, the people of district 12, everyone i care about back 
home could be punished if i canâ€™t pull off the girl-driven-
crazy-by-love scenario haymitch has suggested. 
so i still have a chance, though. funny, in the arena, when i 
poured out those berries, i was only thinking of

n shots of tributes dying and shots of us. mostly peeta re-
ally, thereâ€™s no question heâ€™s carrying this romance thing on 
his shoulders. now i see what the audience saw, how he 
misled the careers about me, stayed awake the entire night 
under the tracker jacker tree, fought cato to let me escape and 
even while he lay in that mud bank, whispered my name in his 
sleep. i seem heartless in comparison â€” dodging fireballs, 
dropping nests, and blowing up supplies â€” until i go hunting 
for rue. they play her death in full, the spearing, my failed 
rescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from district 1â€™s 
throat, rue drawing her last breath in my arms. and the song. 
i get to sing every note of the song. something inside me shuts 
down and iâ€™m too numb to feel anything. itâ€™s like watching 
complete strangers in another hunger games. but i do notice 
they omit the part where i covered her in flowers. 
right. because even that smacks of rebellion.

being very free with my kisses. objectively, i can see the mutts 
and catoâ€™s death are as gruesome as ever, but again, i feel it 
happens to people i have never met. 
and then comes the moment with the berries. i can hear 
the audience hushing one another, not wanting to miss any-
thing. a wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me 
when they end not with the announcement of our victory, but 
with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, scream-
ing peetaâ€™s name as they try to revive him. 
in terms of survival, itâ€™s my best moment all night.

there are only a handful of cameras to record the event. no 
live audience at least. 
caesar flickerman gives me a warm hug when i. come in. 
â€œcongratulations, katniss. how are you faring?â€ 
â€œfine. nervous about the interview,â€ i say. 
â€œdonâ€™t be. weâ€™re going to have a fabulous time,â€ he says, 
giving my cheek a reassuring pat. 
â€œiâ€™m not good at talking about myself,â€ i say. 
â€œnothing you say will be wrong,â€ he says. 
and i think, oh, caesar, if only that were true. but actually, 

president  snow  may  be  arranging  some  sort  of  â€œaccidentâ€  for 
me as we speak.

then peetaâ€™s there looking handsome in red and white, 
pulling me off to the side. â€œi hardly get to see you. haymitch 
seems bent on keeping us apart.â€ 
haymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive, but there are 
too many ears listening, so i just say, â€œyes, heâ€™s gotten very re-
sponsible lately.â€ 
â€œwell, thereâ€™s just this and we go home. then he canâ€™t wa

 and pulling 
up the bottom of peetaâ€™s pants. â€œoh, no,â€ i whisper, taking in 
the metal-and-plastic device that has replaced his flesh. 
â€œno one told you?â€ asks caesar gently. i shake my head. 
â€œi havenâ€™t had the chance,â€ says peeta with a slight shrug. 
â€œitâ€™s my fault,â€ i say. â€œbecause i used that tourniquet.â€ 
â€œyes, itâ€™s your fault iâ€™m alive,â€ says peeta. 
â€œheâ€™s right,â€ says caesar. â€œheâ€™d have bled to death for sure 
without it.â€ 
i guess this is true, but i canâ€™t help feeling upset about it to 
the extent that iâ€™m afraid i might cry and then i remember 
everyone in the country is watching me so i just bury my face 
in peetaâ€™s shirt. it takes them a couple of minutes to coax me 
back out because itâ€™s better in the shirt, where no one can see 
me, and when i do come out, caesar backs off questioning me 
so i can recover. in fact, he pretty much leaves me alone until 
the berries come up. 
â€œkatniss, i know youâ€™ve had a shock, but i
