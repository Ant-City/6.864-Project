arthur, achilles, prometheus, and other legendary figures treated by lord
raglan in the hero and by joseph campbell in the hero with a thousand
faces.

from classical greek and roman mythology in an effort to identify and
incorporate the various allusions morrison draws upon in the novel.2
these approaches lead to focusing upon the dangerous circumstances
surrounding milkmanâ€™s conception and birth as explanations for his difference.
there is magic in pilate giving ruth a potion to administer in macon
deadâ€™s food in order to ensure milkmanâ€™s conception, and there is the added
trauma of macon trying to force an abortion once he learns that his four-day
renewed sexual attraction for his wife has led to her pregnancy. to minimize
the danger, pilate, the witchlike godmother, watches over milkmanâ€™s advent

ut, and it does not serve to account wholly for
milkmanâ€™s actions. milkman may be in search of something, but he also carries
â€œsomethingâ€ within himself that he must uncover as he makes his geographical
and psychological journey. the pieces of those familiar patterns,
therefore, in the final analysis do not add up to a wholeness of approach to
the novel. they leave the myth hunters pleased with their recognition of the
various myths, but dissatisfied that such myths do not bring them to a single,
complete understanding of the novelâ€”not to mention the various multiple
strands of understanding.
the problem with such approaches is the refusal by critics to see the
classical allusions as additional layers that enhance but are not designed to
explain the novel. morrison recognizes that the use of such stories to explain
african-american culture would amount to a grossly ineffective superimposition
of an alien world view on a culture that she has consistently shown
to be resistant to suc

both and neither. when we consequently try to fit the actions of milkman
dead into a pattern, we arrive at the same ambiguous conclusions. should
all of his former trespasses be forgiven just because he learns to fly? was
he right in emotionally abusing and neglecting hagar? wrong in telling
macon about corinthiansâ€™s affair with porter? as joseph t. skerrett, jr., has
pointed out, stories of various kinds are key to the structuring of the novel,
and the presentation of everybodyâ€™s versions of events about themselves
and othersâ€”frequently contradictoryâ€”reflects the essence of the africanamerican
storytelling tradition.6

gold. while it may be viewed as a prank, the robbery nonetheless has the
overtones of greed and self-aggrandizement that have characterized milkman
in relation to macon. instead of condemning or excusing the action at
this point, we are encouraged to wait for whatever outcome morrison has in

with morrisonâ€™s earlier novels, but also from the shades of gray that
permeate this novel.
and why does morrison ask us to withhold judgment on milkman for
so long? the answer lies in part in the paradoxical elements of his nickname.

ruthâ€™s primary function in the novel is to give birth to milkman, not
to establish a relationship with himâ€”certainly not beyond the long period
of nursing. she is important to his story only as long as her body serves his
needs (or as long as she can nurse him without discovery); once those needs
are served, he casts her aside emotionally, as he will later similarly discard
hagar. ruth has very little reality for milkman, and she is not drawn so that

ves its purpose in pushing milkman
toward maturity. the pattern is set in a way that milkman thrives in direct
proportion to hagarâ€™s demise. as he learns more about his relationship to her
and the rest of his family, her physical essence decreases in value. for each
stage on the journey that brings enlightenment to milkman, that enlightenment
comes directly from hagarâ€™s lifeline. when he discoversâ€”in shalimar,
virginia, sitting in front of solomonâ€™s general storeâ€”that the children are
singing about his great-grandfather, he moves into a realm of self-awareness
that makes it impossible for him to treat anyone else as he has treated hagar.
almost in keeping with that progression, hagar dies. another victim on his
search for self, she has helped milkman in substantial ways by being an outlet
for his negative emotions and a symbol around which he gathers his reflections.

these pathetic women and the losses do not measure up, in the final
balance, to the loss of pilateâ€™s life in milkmanâ€™s quest for identity, family, and
value beyond gold. teacher, nurturer, surrogate mother, keeper of the blues
tradition, pilate has always placed value on altruistic human relationships.
in all of these roles, she gives voice to the value of human connectedness. in
singing â€œo sugarman,â€ she serves as the herald for milkmanâ€™s birth. in singing
with reba and hagar, she articulates the pain macon feels and soothes
his wounds. in singing at hagarâ€™s death, she voices the pain of loss in sound
rather than lyrics. and in singing the â€œsong of solomon,â€ she places stress on
the intricate ties to african and black american history that unite all generations
of those scattered in the diaspora. in her voice is the blending of secular

and, in turn, to not pass on any heritage to his
own children save for his capitalist pronouncements and achievements. consequently,
for the macon dead family, the american dream has replaced the
memory of a black cultural heritage.
maconâ€™s insensitivity has infected his entire family. his wife, ruth,
whom he treats abominably by periodically beating her and denying her love
and sexual gratification, has withdrawn into a fantasy world seeking comfort
in sleeping on her fatherâ€™s grave and nursing milkman until he is eight years
old. maconâ€™s two daughters, first corinthians and magdalena called lena,
having received little love in their lives, regale themselves in the material trappings
of middle-class ritual and convention. and because he knows no other
way, milkman, for a time, passively accepts his fatherâ€™s selfish code and, as a
young adult, works for him in the real estate and rental business. in short,
the atmosphere surrounding the dead family hardly constitutes what one

macon kept each member of his family awkward with fear. his
hatred for his wife glittered and sparked in every word he spoke
to her. the disappointment he felt in his daughters sifted down on
them like ash, dulling their buttery complexions and choking the
lilt out of what should have been girlish voices. under the frozen
heat of his glance they tripped over doorsills and dropped the salt
cellar into the yolks of their poached eggs. the way he mangled
their grace, wit, and self-esteem was the single excitement of their
days. without the tension and drama he ignited, they might not
have known what to do with themselves. (10)
macon and his family exemplify the patriarchal, nuclear family which
traditionally has been a critical and stable feature in western societies. however,

the dead family symbolize the degeneration of western values, particularly

labor pains, milkmanâ€™s aunt pilate, sister to macon and at this point in the

some stable visual object that assure[s] her that the world [is] still there . . .
that she [is] alive somewhereâ€ (11).
loveless and invisible, ruth also clings selfishly to milkman, using him,
like the watermark, as a measure of personal stability while realizing that â€œher
son [has] never been a person to her, a separate real person. he [has] always
been a passionâ€ (131). milkman is â€œher single triumph,â€ and her personal
effrontery to a world that has given her neither love nor purpose. the used

and victimization that surround black life. the woods and the darkness
convey the fear, loneliness, and alienation of black reality, but pilate
also testifies to the courage and self-sufficiency that she and macon demonstrated
and, even though they now travel diametrically opposing paths,
they continue to demonstrate.
as pilate continues to testify, it is guitar and not milkman who responds
with questions about her father, her fatherâ€™s farm, its location, and the year of
pilateâ€™s and maconâ€™s untimely flight. but characteristic of an oral storyteller,
pilate relates events to events and moment to moments which intersect with
a pulsing poetic quality that transforms historical fact into a felt experience.

into what appears to be a social utopia, an alternative world of blissful clarity
where difference articulates a form of liberation from the predictable and
reified world of macon dead.
even macon himself, in spite of his objection to pilateâ€™s difference, feels
liberated as he one night walks past the wine house and hears the women
singing. he, too, â€œsurrender[s] to the sound . . .â€ and feels â€œhimself softening
under the weight of memory and music . . .â€ (29â€“30). pilateâ€™s world is cyclical,
expansive, and alluring to anyone who comes in contact with it. instead of
repressing the past, she carries it with her in the form of songs and stories and
synthesizes it with the present. her past softens and liberates others because
she evokes and embodies a collective (un)consciousness which manifests itself

moreover, he seldom accepts responsibility for his actions and when he
does, it is only to demonstrate his own self-righteousness. for instance, when
he strikes his father for humiliating his mother, he does so because he believes
himself to be â€œwide-spirited and generous enoughâ€ (69) to do so. to prove
that he is not a bad man, macon tells milkman that he had seen ruth naked
and kissing her deceased father. macon, in his own distorted way, wishes to
justify his continued humiliation of ruth, and ironically his continued support
for his wife; as he believes, there is â€œâ€˜nothing to do but kill a woman like
thatâ€™â€ (74).
but instead of making milkman understand his behavior, macon, in
exposing the reason for his loveless marriage, inadvertently prompts a shocked
milkman into realizing that he â€œnever . . . thought of his mother as a person,

to further complicate his involvement with the family, he and hagar
become sexually attracted to each other, and at the respective ages of seventeen
and twenty-two, they consummate the relationship. for the first
three years, milkman is delighted by the affair especially since, whenever he
appears, she is â€œall smiles and welcome.â€ after fourteen years, however, the
attraction has diminished for milkman. his indifference is heightened in
direct proportion to hagarâ€™s increasingly possessive love, and both attitudes
have destructive potential.
the narrator comments that â€œmilkman [has] stretched his carefree
boyhood out for thirty-one years. hagar [is] thirty-six-and nervousâ€ (98).
he feels that â€œthere [is] no excitement, no galloping blood in his neck or his

reader full circle to the textâ€™s original scene. robert smith was himself a
member of the days and guitar was a witness to his flightless death. like
smith, guitarâ€™s vision of violence begetting violence keeps him on a flightless
path until he is driven to madness by his own obsession for pilateâ€™s gold.
his ideology proves just as inadequate as macon deadâ€™s acculturated vision.
however, like his fatherâ€™s corpse, guitar is a split subject. while he espouses
his single-minded doctrine, he nonetheless appears as milkmanâ€™s alter-ego,
whose social perceptions seem more correctly fixed than milkmanâ€™s; and thus,
coupled with his communal southern background and his â€œslow smile of recognitionâ€
(49) toward pilateâ€™s folk world, guitar provides an antithetically
connective energy in milkmanâ€™s search for self and place.

proportions in that he discovers the ancient circe still residing there, now
approximately 175 years old, and waiting specifically for him. circe stands
guard to the entrance into milkmanâ€™s ancestral past. and like an aeneas or
a ulysses, milkman must establish direct contact with this past before he
can form a path to the future. circe tells milkman the real names of his
grandparentsâ€”jake and singâ€”and that shalimar, virginia is their original
birthplace. earlier we learned that macon, sr., had been misnamed when he
was inducted into the union army. by learning their true names and origin,
milkman has unconsciously begun his quest for self and place, for beneath
their names and origins lay his connection to not only a personal heritage but
to a deeper vein of black history and myth.

 of the south and shalimar,
his new-found idealism appears secure, while at the same time he no longer
fears himself or the unknown. his mythic initiation and transformation coupled
with his fearlessly empathic appraisal of guitar implies that milkman is
now able to mediate between both myth and reality. as his initiation signifies,
it is the myth of brotherhood and belonging which ultimately springs from
and illuminates reality.
when milkman first arrived in shalimar, he had heard the children
singing the song of solomon, â€œthat old blues song pilate sang all the time:
â€˜o sugarman donâ€™t leave me here,â€™ except the children [sing] â€˜solomon donâ€™t
leave me hereâ€™â€ (303). the song is the clue to milkmanâ€™s family history, but
more significantly, it also becomes for him an affirmation for kinship and
community. as he more carefully listens to the song again, milkman is
finally able to piece together his genealogy. symbols of flying permeate the
childrenâ€™s ritual while, as they

sing, one child â€œturn[s] around like an airplaneâ€
(267). and as they sing, milkman listens to them recount the flight
from slavery of his grandfatherâ€™s father, solomon or shalimar, back to the
freedom of his african homeland. the song is both a variant of the flying
african folktales and of the icarus tale. solomon literally flies off with
his infant son, jake, leaving behind his wife, ryna, and some twenty other
children. susan byrd, cousin to jakeâ€™s wife, sing, confirms to milkman the
magical tale behind the song:
â€œno, i mean flew. . . . he was flying. he flew. you know like a bird.
just stood up in the fields one day, ran up some hill, spun around a
couple of times, and was lifted up in the air.â€ (326)
but, as susan continues, solomon â€œâ€˜brushed too close to a tree and the baby
slipped out of his armsâ€™â€ (327), so that jake, too, was left behind which signaled
the long rupture in his familyâ€™s history.

meaning. no wonder pilate put hers in her ear. when you know
your name, you should hang on to it, for unless it is noted down
and remembered, it will die when you do. (333)
milkman returns to the southside to tell pilate the good news of these
rediscovered names and to correct her misconceptions about them. pilateâ€™s
mother died in childbirth and her name was never revealed to pilate. â€œsing,
singâ€ is not her fatherâ€™s request to sing, but a call to his wife. â€œyou just canâ€™t
fly on off and leave a bodyâ€ is not simply a moral precept, but her fatherâ€™s
plea to bury his bones which she unknowingly has carried with her for all
these years.
but milkman is not at first given his opportunity. pilate breaks â€œa wet
green bottle over his headâ€ (335) and locks him in her cellar. filled with exuberance,
milkman had come home with the vision of solomon as a hero and

personal identity is inextricably linked to pilateâ€™s principle of responsibility
to others. and thus, he learns that objectification and commodification of
people only serve to further his sense of distortion and alienation. when
milkman finally tells pilate of his discoveries, the two return to shalimar to
bury her fatherâ€™s bones. at the burial site, pilate is shot and killed by guitar;
the potential for pilate to carry forth a new myth wherein singâ€™s legacy is
traced to her descendants is forever silenced.
but paradoxically, in pilateâ€™s death, we are left with an image of pilate
that offers the only definitive transcendence in the novel. as milkman affirms,
she is a person who â€œwithout ever leaving the ground . . . could flyâ€ (340). her
spirit has surpassed all the other negative images of flight; she is the one
character who, in spite of her physical restlessness and isolation, has been able

milkmanâ€™s reintegration into the community depends upon his acceptance
of individual relationships which, in the end, he can only achieve
through personal heroism. in choosing to â€œrideâ€ toward guitar, milkman
must take his ultimate risk which may very well end in his death, but as the
novelâ€™s open-ending suggests, his flight forever sets in motion an open and
necessary dialectic between a communal spirit and a factional reality.

calling attention to the personal-familial and social-historical forces
that shape the formation of african-american identities and also focusing
on the social, class, and political tensions within the black community, song of
solomon is addressed, in part, to middle-class african americans, especially
males, who have a kind of amnesia about their cultural historyâ€”about the
shame and trauma of family histories rooted in slaveryâ€”and who, in donning
the mask of bourgeois (white-identified) â€œpride,â€ come to see poor blacks as
stigmatized objects of contempt. like the bluest eye and sula, song of solomon

also deals with the shame and pride issues surrounding skin color, the
internalized racism that affords light skin a greater social value than dark skin.
in deliberately setting out to confront the vexed issues surrounding color and
class, song of solomon exposes what has been called the â€œdirty little secretâ€ and
â€œlast tabooâ€ of african-american culture, the existence of intraracial color
prejudice and discriminationâ€”the so-called color complexâ€”which continues
to be an â€œembarrassing and controversial subject for african americansâ€
(russell 3, 2, 1).2 according to bell hooks, â€œthose black folks who came of
age before black power faced the implications of color caste either through
devaluation or overvaluation.â€ if being born light meant beginning life â€œwith
an advantage recognized by everyone,â€ being born dark meant starting life
â€œhandicapped, with a serious disadvantage.â€ the 1960s black liberation movement
challenged this notion with its empowering â€œcall t

but in the late 1970s, around the time song of solomon was published,
the â€œpolitics of racial assimilation,â€ which had always operated as a â€œbacklash,â€
not only began to undermine black self-determination but also led, in the
1980s and 1990s, to the â€œresurgenceâ€ of the color-caste hierarchy (outlaw
culture 174, 175, 178).
song of solomon acts out an important social mission as it deals with
issues that african americans find painful and embarrassing, such as the slavery
origins of black american culture and the persistence of both intraracial
color prejudice and class conflict within the african-american community.
but because song of solomon is a densely textured narrative, it succeeds, in part,

shame, trauma, and race in the novels of toni morrison 61
the opening scene of the novel, which tells of the aborted, suicidal â€œflightâ€ of
mr. smith that presages milkmanâ€™s birth, is often read as a deliberately staged
dramatization of the birth of the mythic hero. as critics have observed, milkmanâ€™s
birth is accompanied by the â€œritualized celebrationâ€ of pilateâ€™s singing
and of virgins (i.e., milkmanâ€™s sisters) â€œstrewing rose petals as a black icarus
diesâ€ (a. leslie harris 72). yet this opening scene, even as it evokes the heroâ€™s
birth, is also tinged with shame. with his blue silk wings curved around his
chest, mr. smith masquerades as the proud heroâ€”the flying african. but he
is also an object of ridicule and contempt as he stands on the roof of mercy

ember of the terrorist organization, the

perpetrated against african americans.
drawing attention away from such issues, the novel indulges in mythmaking
as it associates mr. smithâ€™s leap with milkmanâ€™s birth the next day
in the all-white mercy hospital, which, in the covert countershaming and
dialogic speech of the southside residents, is referred to as no mercy hospital
since it is a place that, in refusing to treat blacks, has shown â€œno mercyâ€
toward their physical suffering. â€œmr. smithâ€™s blue silk wings must have left
their mark, because when the little boy discovered, at four, the same thing mr.
smith had learned earlierâ€”that only birds and airplanes could flyâ€”he lost
all interest in himself â€ (9). such authorial directives focus reader attention on
the theme of â€œflightâ€ in the narrative and lead to the unavoidability of criticreader

rmation, and self-centeredness,â€ and it also has
been argued that morrison, although she follows the monomyth pattern in
the novel, also â€œshrewdlyâ€ mocks milkman, the â€œalleged heroâ€ of the narrative,
who is presented as an â€œintolerable egoistâ€ and who does â€œlittleâ€ to warrant the
â€œhonorific labelâ€ of hero (t. harris, fiction 85, 90, brenner 117, 118).
that some critics repeat the novelâ€™s shaming devaluation of the middle-class
milkman while others counteract shame by focusing on milkmanâ€™s
ultimate flight points to the shameâ€“pride issues that inform morrisonâ€™s representation
of milkmanâ€™s search for his african-american identity. in order to
understand the secret shame that haunts milkman, who comes to feel like â€œa
garbage pail for the actions and hatreds of other peopleâ€ (120), the narrative
describes milkmanâ€™s middle-class upbringing in passages that recall the cozy,
backyard world of illicit gossip that morrison is so fond of evoking in her
fiction. i

not only ridicules them for their class pretensions, but also actively humiliates
them by insisting on their family pathology and by exposing the shameful

intent on locating the familial and cultural sources of black male pride,
the narrative initially rejects the false pride of milkmanâ€™s maternal grandfather,

antiblack racistâ€”attitudes and behavior. the â€œmost respectedâ€ black man

that â€œdistinguished his own family from the people among whom they livedâ€
(12). to ruth, the water mark is a visible reminder of her family pride: it is
a â€œmooring,â€ the â€œverificationâ€ of an â€œideaâ€ she wants to â€œkeep aliveâ€ (13). but
the water mark also is the â€œsingle flaw on the splendid wood,â€ and it becomes
â€œmore pronouncedâ€ with the passage of time after it is exposed (11â€“12). a
signifier of the hidden stain on the family honorâ€”the stain of blacknessâ€”the
water mark represents the familyâ€™s hidden racial shame. ruthâ€™s obsession with
her stained table, then, signals her own status anxietyâ€”her own internalization

black familyâ€”in this case the middle-class, not the lower-class, familyâ€”as

standing, he soon comes to view her as a source of shame and an object of
disgust. early in his marriage, macon claims that he discovers ruth in bed
with her dead father, â€œnaked as a yard dog, kissing him. him dead and white
and puffy and skinny, and she had his fingers in her mouthâ€ (73). although
macon forgets, and even fabricates, some of the details of this sceneâ€”and,
indeed, ruth later tells a markedly different version of this eventâ€”the â€œodiousnessâ€
remains (17), and some readers may feel vicarious shame-disgust as
they are positioned as curious observers of this voyeuristic scene, which hints
at ruthâ€™s incestuous, and necrophilic, attachment to her dead father. after

sounds â€œdirty, intimate, and hot,â€ is shameful, and he knows that the name

in describing the origins of milkmanâ€™s shame-laden nickname, morrison
appeals yet again to her readersâ€™ voyeuristic interests while she risks provoking
their shame-disgust by positioning them as witnesses to a taboo, oedipally
tinged scene. ruth, who needs â€œa balm, a gentle touch or nuzzling of some
sortâ€ to make her life bearable (13), nurses milkman until he is old enough to
stand up and talk. while ruth takes secret pleasure in nursing her growing
son, milkmanâ€™s â€œsecretive eyesâ€ convey his childish sense that there is something
â€œstrange and wrongâ€ about this incestuous nursing ritual, which abruptly
ends when ruth is discovered by one of maconâ€™s tenants, freddie, a notorious
gossip (14). amused at the sight of the lemony-skinned ruth with her blackskinned
son at her breast, freddie gives ruthâ€™s son his nickname, â€œmilkman.â€

â€œcollection of lunaticsâ€ who make wine and sing in the streets â€œlike common

social outcastâ€™s situation, the text, instead, insists that when the stigmatized,

is liberated and empowered. on recognizing â€œwhat her situation in the world
was and would probably always be,â€ pilate discards â€œevery assumption she had

to live and what she finds important in life, pilate reinvents herself, becoming
a woman who remains â€œjust barely within the boundaries of the elaborately
socialized world of black people.â€ pilate gives up â€œall interest in table manners
or hygiene,â€ yet she acquires â€œa deep concern for and about human relationshipsâ€

by shame, feels the incipient fire of shame-rage burning within her. after
hagar sees milkman with his arms around the shoulders of a light-skinned
womanâ€”a woman with silky copper-colored hair and gray eyesâ€”she experiences
both shame-depression and shame-rage. the lovelorn hagar becomes
â€œlike a restless ghost, finding peace nowhere and in nothingâ€ as she ruminates
on her loss: â€œthe mouth milkman was not kissing, the feet that were not running
toward him, the eye that no longer beheld him, the hands that were not
touching himâ€ (127). then her lethargy dissipates and she feels intense rage
as the â€œcalculated violence of a sharkâ€ grows in her (128).
if hagar is constructed as a traditional dysphoric romantic heroineâ€”a
woman who makes the man the center of her life and thus feels an utter
sense of loss and despair when her love relation failsâ€”she also is presented

makeup. but her efforts at self-improvement and self-transformation are
doomed to failure because the dark-skinned hagar cannot possibly compete

hierarchy, as it examines the issue of class and shame in the construction of
african-american identities, and it also, in its initial description of porter,
reproduces the culturally embedded stereotype of the impulsive and potentially
violent black underclass male by portraying him as the â€œwild man in

a freak? hitlerâ€™s the most natural white man in the world. he killed jews and
gypsies because he didnâ€™t have us. can you see those klansmen shocked by
him? no, you canâ€™tâ€ (155). using the white racist discourse of difference and
pathology to define whiteness, guitar construes whites as an â€œunnaturalâ€ race:
as a morally degenerate, violent, and uncivilized people who kill â€œfor fun.â€

the (white) perpetrator and (black) victim roles, members of the seven days
attempt not only to discharge collective black shame-based rage onto whites
but also to exorcise collective black trauma by relocating feelings of humiliation,
terror, and vulnerability in white victims. through a reversal of the balance
of power, they secretly act out the desire to disempower and traumatize
whites, instilling in them the feelings of utter powerlessness experienced by

attempts to work through milkmanâ€™s shame-shame feeling trap by describing
how he comes to take pride in his family roots. thus, according to the
standard, text-directed reading of song of solomon, when milkman goes on
his journey to danville and shalimar in search of pilateâ€™s buried gold, he
discovers, instead, the real golden treasure of his family roots. but what such
readings tend to bypass are the shame and pain associated with milkmanâ€™s
discovery. in using folk tale and magic and following the pattern of the heroâ€™s
purposeful quest as it describes milkmanâ€™s journey south, song of solomon also
deflects attention away from the trauma and violence that have threatened to

to a fight between a knife-wielding local man and milkman, who defends

6. as utelinde wedertz-furtado points out, it is significant that guitar
remarks that the seven days organization originated after the blinding of a black
veteran of world war i (see song of solomon 155). by linking 1920s black militancy
to that of the 1960s, â€œmorrison suggests the cyclical rising of black militant
groups after non-violent means have failed to guarantee justice and civil rightsâ€
(227). ralph story links the seven days to black secret societies of the nineteenth
century, such as the knights of liberty, an organization that was formed in 1846
to free slaves (152). guitarâ€™s advocacy of violence also recalls the militant rhetoric
of the 1920s inspired by the black nationalism of marcus garvey. for example,

african-american literary theory and criticism, however, frequently
make problematic the issue of race and intertextuality through a politically
understandable urge to focus solely on african-american texts, a part of the
aesthetic past that historically has not received equal status or attention. taking
their cue from morrison herself, some argue that the most appropriate
frame for assessing her literary work is an african-american folk and oral
tradition.5 in his work on the theory of african-american literature, henry
louis gates, jr., does acknowledge that african-american writers revise texts
by white writers with â€œa sense of difference based on the black vernacularâ€
(signifying xxii). his project, however, is to understand the â€œweb of filiationâ€
created when black writers reinvent the tropes of other black writers (signifying

â€œidentityâ€ in the souls of black folk as an always divided â€œdouble-consciousness,â€
heinze notes that double-consciousness may intersect with bakhtinâ€™s
double-voicedness, the russian theoristâ€™s trope for intertextuality. still, for
heinze, the issue is quite clear: â€œmorrisonâ€™s double-consciousness cannot
ultimately be explained in terms of her relationship to the dominant cultureâ€

others who heard faulkner recite long passages of joyceâ€™s work from memory

still, in playing in the dark, morrisonâ€™s discussion of racial figuration
in canonical literature by white authorsâ€”cather, poe, twain, and 
96 john n. duvall
hemingwayâ€”appears to give some credence to her claim that faulkner has
receded from her consciousness. his work is mentioned twice in passing, with
only a brief elaboration in the conclusion of her discussion of the narrative of
arthur gordon pym and huckleberry finn:
we are reminded of other images at the end of literary journeys

for ike (who does not yet know of rothâ€™s affair) in the context of americaâ€™s

of godâ€™s blessing on it has been when men fought to protect does and

returns by the storyâ€™s end to the specificity of the young african-american
woman. after learning that his kinsman roth edmonds has repeated the

fools of the police.
in addition to her spiritual powers, she also has an expressive formâ€”the
song she sings at milkmanâ€™s birth that is the secret genealogy of the solomon
family. but although figuring elements of artistic identity, she is not the artist
whole and complete; she may be the keeper of the oral text and its medium,
but she does not know its meaning. nevertheless, by expressing both the
spiritual and the aesthetic, pilate makes a turn that sula cannot. sulaâ€™s limitation

dead inasmuch as she becomes crazy as a result of loving maconâ€™s son, who
is raised to reproduce maconâ€™s middle-class values. (milkman in name is, of
course, quite literally another macon dead.) milkmanâ€™s rejection of hagar
precisely because she does not fit his middle-class design causes her to desire
to be like the women milkman desiresâ€”light-complexioned and possessing
all the totemic markers of middle-class feminine beauty. so at the very time
that milkman on his journey through pennsylvania and virginia progressively
loses all the signs of middle-class gentility (his cutty sark, florsheim shoes,
and longines watch), hagar gathers to herself its feminine counterparts (an
evan-picone skirt, con brios, and van raalte gloves). it would, however, be
inappropriate to label macon as the sole or final author of hagarâ€™s desire, for

how might one account for this changed attitude from the time morrison
was composing song of solomon in the mid-1970s to this more recent and
relaxed position?
her third novel was the main selection of the book of the month
club, the first african-american novel so designated since richard wrightâ€™s
native son. additionally, song of solomon won awards from both the national
criticâ€™s circle and the american academy and institute of arts and letters.
morrisonâ€™s success as an author, over and above her work as an editor (a
position she left following the publication of her th

ird novel), meant that she
finally was earning an income that placed her very comfortably in the middle
class by any purely economic measure. perhaps, then, the lived contradiction
between her fictive resolutionsâ€”which had consistently made black poverty
the only place in which an african american could hope to attain an authentic
identityâ€”and her certain recognition of her own sharply rising income led
her to rethink her early fictionâ€™s identifications. clearly she must have realized
that having money does not necessarily mean that an african american is
â€œwhiteâ€ or a sellout. what she would need was a way to reimagine blackness
that allowed for the individual to develop economically as well as spiritually.

. . . it would be impossible, in the symbolic sphere, to isolate the principle of one

african-american women to property.
14. charles scruggs briefly comments on this scene, suggesting that when

him how he could save his own life, that he could save it only if he bridged the gap

fatherâ€™s death prevail, as do the opportunities for even an fdr to join a

[guitar asserts] â€œand given him some tobacco, a checkerboard,

the text makes it increasing clear, though, that the seven days fundamentally
resembles or mirrors the klan, and that the dubious issue of blood purity
informs their struggle. the retributive killing, guitar explains, secures the
death of several generations and keeps the ratio of black-to-white blood static.

s about love, her way of life, and her
rejection of material things, also point to the social vision articulated by du
bois, and shared by both king and malcolm x just before their murders: that
the goal for equal justice under the law was a first step toward transforming
americaâ€™s capitalist structure. for du bois, the prerogative of private capital
over black lives formed the basis of the nationâ€™s racism and violence; only
the repudiation of capitalism could initiate a just society. increasingly influenced
by this position, malcolm x followed suit with announcements like,
â€œyou show me a capitalist, iâ€™ll show you a bloodsuckerâ€ (qtd. in â€œpilgrimageâ€
392). the civil rights movement was, moreover, primarily a black workersâ€™
movement, supported and fortified across the country by communist organizations,
black membership in unions, and socialist groups like the league
of revolutionary black workers and the black panthers. and, because of its

she calls the bag of bones her inheritance, and like her dead fatherâ€™s refrain,
it becomes an object of interpretation in the novel. her fatherâ€™s words, â€œâ€˜sing,

mother, they also form a command and link pilateâ€™s singing to her pastâ€”even
her slave past, where singing often functioned as a way for slaves to get around
the laws that prevented them from talking to each other. pilateâ€™s fatherâ€™s ghost

mply in terms of justice versus injustice, nor in
terms of the certainty of a present good (117). rather, justice must be held
apart from a present system, must function as a limit to which we are drawn
and for which we are answerable.
justice performs then as a disruption of the present and as endless pressure
on the law. it is the perhaps that always questions the is, not as telos, but as
the â€œnot yet that remains other than the present, arriving from both the past
and the futureâ€ (136). using a kind of diaspora metaphor, cornell remarks
that the good, an impossible presence, can be fragmented across the laws, so
that laws function as principles guiding ethical behaviour rather than simply
as determinants distributing violence and power. if justice and the good
are thus always incomplete, then the laws remain open to interpretation and
reinterpretationâ€”and rights can always be undermined if they fail in â€œthe
locus of responsibilityâ€ (151).

for its own contradiction and destruction. and it is interpretation that
separates law from justiceâ€”releasing both from myths of atemporal morality
and permitting an opening for responsibility and for what she calls the dream
of the â€œsubject of dialogueâ€ (177).

in order to enact jim crow laws, the states had to define the so-called

to marry whites; those with one-sixteenth negro blood or more could not

course, to more legislation in the matter of blood donations and transfusions.

he learns something of his history from his father and pilate, the future and,
by implication, the past do not exist for milkman; rather, as morrison writes,
â€œthe present did extend itself â€ (35). as milkman becomes aware of his past,
he comes to realize first that â€œyou canâ€™t do the past overâ€ when his father tells
his version of the events surrounding ruthâ€™s fatherâ€™s death, how he supposedly
found ruth lying next to her fatherâ€™s newly dead body, naked â€œas a yard
dog, kissing himâ€ (76, 73). milkman becomes angry when this knowledge
of the past threatens him, for the first time, in a personal way. he seethes
with resentment because his father came to him â€œwith some way-out taleâ€ to
explain the high level of animosity between himself and ruth (76). in short,

however, after circe teaches milkman how to listen and hear, and the
â€œshitâ€ that weighs him down begins to fall away, milkman stops running and
begins to cultivate an understanding of his past. morrison charts this constructive
change by employing milkmanâ€™s watch as a symbol of it. when he
realizes that grace failed to give his watch back to him during that initial
visit with susan byrd, he remarks, â€œdamn, . . . iâ€™m losing everythingâ€ (294).
milkman then determines, â€œa watch was not worth worrying about. all it
could do was tell him the time of day and he really wasnâ€™t interestedâ€ (295).
after the second meeting, during which susan confirms many of milkmanâ€™s
speculations about his family history, she offers to get his watch back for
him and he replies, â€œnever mindâ€ (325). as he begins to learn about the past,
his interest in the measurement of present time begins to wane, and morrison,

 that he loved her because â€œwithout
ever leaving the ground, she could flyâ€ (336). as he cradles her dying body,
milkman realizes that pilate taught him how to fly in a similar fashion by
teaching him how to appreciate and interact with his familial legacy. he
assumes control of that history and demonstrates both his mastery of it and
debt to it by acknowledging his responsibility to pilate when he revises her
â€œsugarmanâ€ lament into a tribute for her, the â€œsugargirlâ€ he continues to sing
for even after she dies, his voice rising â€œlouder and louder as though sheer
volume would wake herâ€ (336).

morrison focuses a significant portion of her thesis on another of
faulknerâ€™s fathers, thomas sutpen. faulkner hardly characterizes sutpen as
the sort of ineffectual father embodied by mr. compson; instead, sutpen
seems an overpowering patriarchal figure who has little, if any, regard for his
children outside of his own interests. morrison asserts that sutpen

rrived in montour county in the same state
of ignorance and poverty that marked sutpenâ€™s entrance to jefferson (120). a
specific phrase that suggests a further connection between the two characters
concerns the establishment of their estates. in her thesis, morrison quotes
the line from absalom, absalom! in which quentin imagines how sutpen
â€œdragged house and gardensâ€ out of a â€œvirgin swampâ€ (â€œtreatmentâ€ 36, absalom
32); she describes the way the elder macon established his farm, using
very similar terms when milkman thinks of how he â€œtore a farm out of a
wildernessâ€ (song 293). milkmanâ€™s father also feels a sutpen-like materialistic
desire. he advises milkman that the most important thing in life is to â€œown
things,â€ and thus reveals that his fatherâ€™s death and the loss of the family farm
instilled in him a desire for worldly possessions that rivals even sutpenâ€™s (55).
unlike sutpen, however, macon realizes what a high price he paid for that
material comfort. re

the genuine emotion he expresses when thinking of her contrasts starkly
with his thoughts of returning home to â€œhis wifeâ€™s narrow unyielding back; his
daughters, boiled dry from years of yearning; his son, to whom he could speak
only if his words held some command or criticismâ€ (28). maconâ€™s deliberate
disassociation from his family appears even more devastating when juxtaposed
with the three-part harmony that pilateâ€™s family creates as he watches
â€œthe effortless beauty of the women singing in the candlelightâ€ (29). milkman
later notices that talking about the past softens his father somehow, and
maconâ€™s childhood becomes the subject of the first genuine conversation the
two men ever have (52). morrison may create milkmanâ€™s father in the image
of sutpen, but when the past returns to haunt macon, unlike sutpen, he
realizes that he sold out by trading human connection for respectability and
security; macon longs for the early familial affinity that he threw so carelessly

€™s awareness of his loss makes it apparent that when viewed through
the lens of morrisonâ€™s earlier work, song of solomon marks a turning point in
her exploration of the theme of isolation. readers can see morrison working
though the problems she associates with isolation in her first two novels,
in which abusive, emotionally distant fathers and communities simply
refuse to acknowledge the ugliness of the reality that exists in their midst.
in the bluest eye, neither an entire community nor a single family, trapped
by chollyâ€™s domination, can save pecola breedlove. in morrisonâ€™s second
novel, the community of medallion refuses sula a similar salvation in this
life, though morrison intimates that she likely achieves it in the next one.
song of solomon finally shows readers a protagonist who becomes intimately
connected to a communal and historical knowledge and grows through that
relationship. in this novel, readers can see morrison working towards the
powerful communal saving force t

some critics, though, believe that milkmanâ€™s gender makes that growth
problematic and criticize song of solomonâ€™s apparently careless treatment of
women.11 while women certainly do not fare well in morrisonâ€™s text, i would
argue that milkmanâ€™s increasing valuation of pilate and the responsibility he
comes to feel for hagarâ€™s death somewhat answer such claims. as milkman
points out, â€œyou canâ€™t do the past over,â€ and, in the end, he can offer those
he has wronged only his regret (song 76). it also seems important to note
that rather than reducing the women in this novel at milkmanâ€™s expense, the
way that morrison reworks faulknerâ€™s theme of isolation with milkmanâ€™s
sisters, first corinthians and magdalene called lena, significantly

uses the bible to juxtapose implied narratives,
images, and symbolic motifs to heighten contradictions and conjure
up meaning. in the way that she uses biblical imagery and combines this
with african and afro-american folkloric elements, morrison engages in
what african american theologian osayande obery hendricks describes as
â€œguerrilla exegesisâ€:
exegesis, from the greek term signifying a narrative, a description,
an explanation, an interpretation; a process of bringing out/leading
out/teasing out meanings and significance heretofore obscured
or hidden from view. guerrilla exegesis, then, is the bringing or
leading out of oppressed/ suppressed/donâ€™t-get-no-press meanings
by sabotage subversion or other non-traditional appropriations of
hegemonic renderings . . . a theology of new categories and old (and
emergent) structures of feeling: a double-voiced theology. (2â€“3)
in operating as a guerrilla exegete, morrison appropriates the methodology
of christian typology, and her primary

sees the orgasmic rhythm of sexuality that is so evident in the biblical poem as
saturating the whole novel: â€œthe rhythm of the book has this kind of building
up, sort of in and out, explosion. thereâ€™s this beat in it . . . something in the
blood, in the body, thatâ€™s operating underneath the languageâ€ (76), the same
rhythm that operates underneath the language of the song of solomon.
by using the song of solomon as a type to frame her novel, morrison
emphasizes the central role that song, especially the song that pilate sings
at the beginning of the novel and that the children chant at the end, plays
in her story. lawrence-mcintyre argues in her essay â€œdouble meanings of
spiritualsâ€ that â€œslaves used bible stories to retain aspects of their traditional
religions in the form and structure of their songsâ€ (383). to support her argument,
she quotes quincy jonesâ€™s observation

on with their biblical namesakes. however, to ignore the typological
significance of these names and the biblical narratives that these types
evoke is to lose whole layers of meaning that can enrich our reading of the
novel. to borrow from the metaphor that alter uses to describe the artistry of
the author of genesis, morrison mobilizes a biblical subtext to create â€œpostcubistâ€
portraits of her characters that juxtapose or superimpose apparently
contradictory qualities to produce an encompassing whole.
ruth is a character who seems to have little in common with her type.
it is true that the biblical ruth is known for her loyalty and that morrisonâ€™s
ruth is loyal to the memory of her father; however, the loyalty of the biblical
ruth is of a very different nature. blood does not define it; she chooses to be
loyal to her poverty-stricken and helpless mother-in-law, naomi. by juxtaposing
the two loyal ruths, morrison uses biblical subtext to emphasize the

of the materialistic north and unable to find her way back to the comfort of
origins. like the bibleâ€™s hagar, her life is destroyed by a man who uses her
sexually and then abandons her. both hagarsâ€™ destinies are marked by loss.
but there is one glaring difference in the fate of the two women: morrisonâ€™s
hagar is alone and childless, while the bibleâ€™s hagar has her son, ishmael.
for those who know the bible, hagarâ€™s barrenness and her obsessive sense of
loss is emphasized by the missing ishmael, an absence that haunts the novel.
paulâ€™s typological interpretation of this story intensifies the poignancy of the
missing ishmael. in his letter to the galatians, paul reads this story as an
allegory. hagarâ€™s son ishmael, the son of a slave, represents the people of the
old covenant, excluded from the new christian covenant with god and thus
spiritually enslaved, while isaac, although born second, is the son of a free
woman and represents the â€œchildren of promiseâ€ who, through

 christ, are the
rightful heirs of the new jerusalem (gal. 4.22â€“31). hagar and her absent son
ishmael are types of the novelâ€™s hagar and the excluded african american
people of the united states.
in the bible, hagar is a relatively minor character and just as, for people
who know the bible, ishmaelâ€™s absence haunts the song of solomon, for those
that know the koran, the missing links of hagarâ€™s story haunt the bible.
the koranâ€™s hagar is a central character and her son ishmael plays a pivotal
role, much like the one isaac plays in the bible. it is ishmael, not isaac,
who escapes sacrifice at the hand of his father through divine intervention,
and he then goes on to found the ancestral line that produces the prophet
mohammed. the matriarch hagarâ€™s triumph in the face of adversity is commemorated
every year by thousands of devote moslems who are obliged,

traditional notions of self-respect, and becomes, paradoxically, empowered.
her way forward is not to emulate strong independent female figures like
her aunt pilate, but it is a way forward, nonetheless. morrison has created in
corinthians a testament to the unexpected, unorthodox, and surprising ways
human beings find their own path to freedom. she is reminiscent of one of
the post-cubists portraits that alter refers to. she is full of contradictions but
is characterized by an underlying coherence that is satisfying at the same time

mother rachel is barren for many years, until god, like pilate, intervenes and

struggle with god or the angel. in one of the most perplexing incidents in the
bible, jacob prevails over god and, through the struggle, gains a new name,

with guitar, who has appropriated the power of life and death. guitar is an

 of a righteous, avenging god. roland barthes, in
his famous essay â€œthe struggle with the angel,â€ sees in this struggle a reflection
of jacobâ€™s struggle with his brother esau (90). milkman and guitar, like
jacob and esau, are both brothers and enemies. their connection and enmity
reflect that of jacob and esau, but the deep love they have for each other
reflects another type in the bible, the passionate love of david4 and jonathan,
a male love â€œpassing the love of womenâ€ (2 sam. 1.26). like jacob, milkman
is transformed by this struggle and is able to rejoin the men of shalimar with
a new humility and appreciation. like jacob, he has seen â€œthe face of godâ€
(gen. 32.30), but he sees it in the face of his fellow human beings.
pilateâ€™s name conjures up the most perplexing type in the whole novel.

 her heroine. some see it as a straightforward pun on
the word pilot, pointing to her role as a guide in facilitating milkmanâ€™s search
and his final flight; others see it as a condemnation of the arbitrary way in
which african americans were given their names. however, all the other
characters with biblical names connect, in one way or another, directly with
their namesakes; morrisonâ€™s choice of pilate as a name for her heroine is so
shocking and perplexing it demands more attention. by choosing pilate as
her heroineâ€™s name, morrison travels into uncharted typology and extremely
subversive territory. the biblical pilate is a type of morrisonâ€™s pilate because
her pilate also kills christ.
when pilate sacrifices her life for milkman, she usurps christâ€™s role.
it is through her death, not jesusâ€™s, that milkman is saved. the truth that
will set milkman free is not the truth of jesus but the truth that is â€œlocked

or a freedom in death, a form of revolutionary suicide? we are left with the
feeling that the dialectical tension between the male and the female, the past
and the future, struggle and reconciliation, is just beginning to be played
out. although milkmanâ€™s journey is the central narrative of song of solomon,
by superimposing his story on the tangled narratives of all the other characters
in the novel, on the mythic and historical past of african america,
and on the subtext of the bible, morrison is able to create a complex picture
that includes both divergence and unity. like the authors of the bible, morrison

to capture the dynamism of the contradictions facing african americans as
they face the future. in setting these contradictions in mot

typology, is considered a type of jesus. guitar, with his association with the vengeful

not the jesus of redemption but the jesus of the second coming, who judges and
condemns those who have sinned. the name of his organization not only provides
an ironic reversal on the seven days of creation of the bible and a nod to the cleansing
destruction of the seven days of noahâ€™s flood but also alludes to the numerous
references to seven that occur in revelation (seven churches, seven candlesticks,
seven stars, seven seals, seven trumpets, seven vials, seven plagues, seven kings,
seven angels, and the beast with seven heads).

for his true name is his story; it becomes a process that involves considerable
stripping away of his masculine ego and social identity, and a renunciation of
his fatherâ€™s solipsism and materialism.

power of naming, despite the strong patrilineal surface narrative, resides to
a very large extent within the bodies and knowledge of women: sing, wife

the women of shalimar reveal the names of milkmanâ€™s ancestors. responding
to the ghost of her father (macon dead the first), pilate and her family

this missing name is incomplete. this search for a name and a story becomes
milkmanâ€™s quest. it is his function to fill in the spaces of the form properly,
to slide the elements of his grandfatherâ€™s history into their original positions,
and thus to discover the names of his forefathers and foremothers: jake and

gold as freedom from the overpowering unhappiness of his family. his quest,
however, will evolve into a search for personal and cultural identity, an identity
that individuates him from the father who bullies his wife and daughters,
neglects and repudiates his only sister, and turns an old woman and her family
out of her home. given his fatherâ€™s misogyny, milkmanâ€™s treatment of women
is hardly surprising. he callously dumps his cousin hagar, after a long-term
relationship, with a thank-you note and a gift, he interferes in his sisterâ€™s love
affair, and he robs his aunt. milkmanâ€™s quest for knowledge and identity, then,
is a gradual movement toward a more decent relationship with women, and a
value system more in line with that of pilate rather than his father. the figure
at the threshold of his development is the uncanny circe.

circe, who signifies the mythic narrative of the heroâ€™s quest, but who simultaneously
deconstructs it. on one level of meaning, as the careful citations of
the sojourn on aeaea make clear, circe functions as she does in the odyssey:
she is an initiatrix who sets the hero on his path to symbolic rebirthâ€”but not
death, for he is already dead. her name alone, singular in its homeric allusion,
denotes the male heroic pattern with its linear androcentric emphasis.
yet because she has existed in other narratives, including epics, poetry, and
novels, she also represents a never-ending cycle of stories. within the compass
of the novel circe is linked with other female voices who convey milkmanâ€™s

and susan byrd who completes the tale. circeâ€™s position in this respect

who allows the hero to seek for something more than his masculine identity,
his place in the parade of heroes who make the necessary trip to the underworld
with the help of female guardians. this dualism is connoted in part by
her gorgeous voice, the voice of a sexy young woman. as narrator, odysseus
mentions circeâ€™s voice several times; she sings in a sweet or clear voice as she
goes about her weaving (od. 10.221 and 254). correspondingly, morrisonâ€™s
circe is possessed of a â€œstrong young cultivated voiceâ€ (242), the â€œmellifluent 
signifying circe in toni morrisonâ€™s song of solomon 195
voice of a twenty year old girlâ€ (240). in the homeric context female voices
denote danger; the sirens are the most obvious example of this.33 but in a
novel that reverberates with the voices of women, circeâ€™s voice has a different
timbre. o
