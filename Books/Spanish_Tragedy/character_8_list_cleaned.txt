the [CHARACTER]  - 
      the [CHARACTER] of spain is an ambivalent character. at times he appears noble and is definitely a friend to hieronimo, resisiting lorenzo's attempts to have the knight-marshal dismissed. but he is also complacent (a typical english stereotype about the spanish), as demonstrated by his callous conversation after the spanish victory in act i, his subsequent dialogue with the ambassador, and his failure to know that horatio has been murdered on his estate.
