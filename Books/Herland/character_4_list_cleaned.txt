[CHARACTER] - 
one of the three explorers who discovers herland. a doctor and a
botanist, jeff is also a southern gentleman, with refined, romantic notions of
idealized femininity, notions that are strongly challenged by the athletic,
independent women of herland. jeff falls in love with celis and puzzles her with
his insistence that he take care of her, rather than simply treat her as an
equal partner. jeff soon comes to prefer herland to any country on earth, though
his appreciation of herlandian culture is tinged with his generally unrealistic,
idealized vision of womanhood.
