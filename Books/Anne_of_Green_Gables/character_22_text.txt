trees all around it. i was gladder than ever. i just love trees. and
there werenâ€™t any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny
things out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them.
they just looked like orphans themselves, those trees did. it used to
make me want to cry to look at them. i used to say to them, â€˜oh, you
_poor_ little things! if you were out in a great big woods with other
trees all around you and little mosses and june bells growing over your
roots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches, you
could grow, couldnâ€™t you? but you canâ€™t where you are. i know just
exactly how you feel, little trees.â€™ i felt sorry to leave them behind
this morning. you do get so attached to things like that, donâ€™t you? is
there a brook anywhere near green gables? i forgot to ask mrs. spencer
that.â€

â€œwell now, yes, thereâ€™s one right below the house.â€

she had made friends with the spring down in the hollow--that wonderful
deep, clear icy-cold spring; it was set about with smooth red sandstones
and rimmed in by great palm-like clumps of water fern; and beyond it was
a log bridge over the brook.

that bridge led anneâ€™s dancing feet up over a wooded hill beyond, where
perpetual twilight reigned under the straight, thick-growing firs and
spruces; the only flowers there were myriads of delicate â€œjune bells,â€
 those shyest and sweetest of woodland blooms, and a few pale, aerial
starflowers, like the spirits of last yearâ€™s blossoms. gossamers
glimmered like threads of silver among the trees and the fir boughs and
tassels seemed to utter friendly speech.

all these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half
hours which she was allowed for play, and anne talked matthew and
marilla half-deaf over her discoveries. not that matthew complained, to
be sure; he listened to it all with a

â€œwell, youâ€™ll have to do without your thrill. i hadnâ€™t any material
to waste on puffed sleeves. i think they are ridiculous-looking things
anyhow. i prefer the plain, sensible ones.â€

â€œbut iâ€™d rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and
sensible all by myself,â€ persisted anne mournfully.

â€œtrust you for that! well, hang those dresses carefully up in your
closet, and then sit down and learn the sunday school lesson. i got
a quarterly from mr. bell for you and youâ€™ll go to sunday school
tomorrow,â€ said marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon.

anne clasped her hands and looked at the dresses.

â€œi did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves,â€ she
whispered disconsolately. â€œi prayed for one, but i didnâ€™t much expect it
on that account. i didnâ€™t suppose god would have time to bother about
a little orphan girlâ€™s dress. i knew iâ€™d just have to depend on
marilla for it. well, fortunately i can imagine that

anne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of bonnyâ€™s
leaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.

â€œthey might have been lonesome while i was away,â€ she explained. â€œand
now about the sunday school. i behaved well, just as you told me. mrs.
lynde was gone, but i went right on myself. i went into the church, with
a lot of other little girls, and i sat in the corner of a pew by the
window while the opening exercises went on. mr. bell made an awfully
long prayer. i would have been dreadfully tired before he got through
if i hadnâ€™t been sitting by that window. but it looked right out on the
lake of shining waters, so i just gazed at that and imagined all sorts
of splendid things.â€

â€œyou shouldnâ€™t have done anything of the sort. you should have listened
to mr. bell.â€

â€œbut he wasnâ€™t talking to me,â€ protested anne. â€œhe was talking to god
and he didnâ€™t seem to be very much inter-ested in it, either. i think

e thought god was too far off though. there was a long row of white
birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through
them, â€˜way, â€˜way down, deep into the water. oh, marilla, it was like a
beautiful dream! it gave me a thrill and i just said, â€˜thank you for it,
god,â€™ two or three times.â€

â€œnot out loud, i hope,â€ said marilla anxiously.

â€œoh, no, just under my breath. well, mr. bell did get through at last
and they told me to go into the classroom with miss rogersonâ€™s class.
there were nine other girls in it. they all had puffed sleeves. i tried
to imagine mine were puffed, too, but i couldnâ€™t. why couldnâ€™t i? it was
as easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when i was alone in
the east gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had
really truly puffs.â€

â€œyou shouldnâ€™t have been thinking about your sleeves in sunday school.

too. i suppose the minister had to match it to the text. i didnâ€™t think
he was a bit interesting. the trouble with him seems to be that he
hasnâ€™t enough imagination. i didnâ€™t listen to him very much. i just let
my thoughts run and i thought of the most surprising things.â€

marilla felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved, but
she was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things anne had
said, especially about the ministerâ€™s sermons and mr. bellâ€™s prayers,
were what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for
years, but had never given expression to. it almost seemed to her that
those secret, unuttered, critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible
and accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of
neglected humanity.

together.

â€œwell, did you find diana a kindred spirit?â€ asked marilla as they went
up through the garden of green gables.

â€œoh yes,â€ sighed anne, blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on
marillaâ€™s part. â€œoh marilla, iâ€™m the happiest girl on prince edward
island this very moment. i assure you iâ€™ll say my prayers with a right
good-will tonight. diana and i are going to build a playhouse in mr.
william bellâ€™s birch grove tomorrow. can i have those broken pieces of
china that are out in the woodshed? dianaâ€™s birthday is in february and
mine is in march. donâ€™t you think that is a very strange coincidence?
diana is going to lend me a book to read. she says itâ€™s perfectly
splendid and tremendously exciting. sheâ€™s going to show me a place back
in the woods where rice lilies grow. donâ€™t you think diana has got very

a series of staccato taps on the west window brought anne flying in from
the yard, eyes shining, cheeks faintly flushed with pink, unbraided hair
streaming behind her in a torrent of brightness.

â€œoh, marilla,â€ she exclaimed breathlessly, â€œthereâ€™s going to be a
sunday-school picnic next week--in mr. harmon andrewsâ€™s field, right
near the lake of shining waters. and mrs. superintendent bell and mrs.
rachel lynde are going to make ice cream--think of it, marilla--_ice
cream!_ and, oh, marilla, can i go to it?â€

â€œjust look at the clock, if you please, anne. what time did i tell you
to come in?â€

â€œtwo oâ€™clock--but isnâ€™t it splendid about the picnic, marilla? please
can i go? oh, iâ€™ve never been to a picnic--iâ€™ve dreamed of picnics, but
iâ€™ve never--â€

â€œoh, marilla,â€ exclaimed anne, flying to the washstand. â€œfive minutes
ago i was so miserable i was wishing iâ€™d never been born and now i
wouldnâ€™t change places with an angel!â€

that night a thoroughly happy, completely tired-out anne returned to
green gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe.

â€œoh, marilla, iâ€™ve had a perfectly scrumptious time. scrumptious is a
new word i learned today. i heard mary alice bell use it. isnâ€™t it very
expressive? everything was lovely. we had a splendid tea and then mr.
harmon andrews took us all for a row on the lake of shining waters--six
of us at a time. and jane andrews nearly fell overboard. she was leaning
out to pick water lilies and if mr. andrews hadnâ€™t caught her by her
sash just in the nick of time sheâ€™d fallen in and probâ€™ly been drowned.
i wish it had been me. it would have been such a romantic experience to
have been nearly drowned. it would be suc

anne, starting out alone in the morning, went down loverâ€™s lane as far
as the brook. here diana met her, and the two little girls went on
up the lane under the leafy arch of maples--â€œmaples are such sociable
trees,â€ said anne; â€œtheyâ€™re always rustling and whispering to
youâ€--until they came to a rustic bridge. then they left the lane
and walked through mr. barryâ€™s back field and past willowmere. beyond
willowmere came violet vale--a little green dimple in the shadow of mr.
andrew bellâ€™s big woods. â€œof course there are no violets there now,â€
 anne told marilla, â€œbut diana says there are millions of them in spring.
oh, marilla, canâ€™t you just imagine you see them? it actually takes away
my breath. i named it violet vale. diana says she never saw the beat
of me for hitting on fancy names for places. itâ€™s nice to be clever at
something, isnâ€™t it? but diana named the birch path. she wanted to, so
i let her; but iâ€™m sure i could have found something more poetical t

plain birch path. anybody can think of a name like that. but the birch
path is one of the prettiest places in the world, marilla.â€

it was. other people besides anne thought so when they stumbled on it.
it was a little narrow, twisting path, winding down over a long hill
straight through mr. bellâ€™s woods, where the light came down sifted
through so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart
of a diamond. it was fringed in all its length with slim young birches,
white stemmed and lissom boughed; ferns and starflowers and wild
lilies-of-the-valley and scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly
along it; and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and
music of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the trees
overhead. now and then you might see a

tle girls in avonlea.

â€œi guess gilbert blythe will be in school today,â€ said diana. â€œheâ€™s been
visiting his cousins over in new brunswick all summer and he only came
home saturday night. heâ€™s _awâ€™fly_ handsome, anne. and he teases the
girls something terrible. he just torments our lives out.â€

dianaâ€™s voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented
out than not.

â€œgilbert blythe?â€ said anne. â€œisnâ€™t his name thatâ€™s written up on the
porch wall with julia bellâ€™s and a big â€˜take noticeâ€™ over them?â€

â€œyes,â€ said diana, tossing her head, â€œbut iâ€™m sure he doesnâ€™t like julia
bell so very much. iâ€™ve heard him say he studied the multiplication
table by her freckles.â€

â€œoh, donâ€™t speak about freckles to me,â€ implored anne. â€œit isnâ€™t
delicate when iâ€™ve got so many. but i do think that writing take-notices
up on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever. i should
just like to see anybody dare to write my name up w

d me a crow a dozen times; and i never heard him
apologize for anything before, either.â€

â€œthereâ€™s a great deal of difference between being called a crow and
being called carrots,â€ said anne with dignity. â€œgilbert blythe has hurt
my feelings _excruciatingly_, diana.â€

it is possible the matter might have blown over without more
excruciation if nothing else had happened. but when things begin to
happen they are apt to keep on.

avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in mr. bellâ€™s spruce
grove over the hill and across his big pasture field. from there they
could keep an eye on eben wrightâ€™s house, where the master boarded. when
they saw mr. phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse;
but the distance being about three times longer than mr. wrightâ€™s lane
they were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three
minutes too late.

on the following day mr. phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic
fits of reform and announced before go

expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned. anyone
who came in late would be punished.

all the boys and some of the girls went to mr. bellâ€™s spruce grove as
usual, fully intending to stay only long enough to â€œpick a chew.â€ but
spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they
picked and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that
recalled them to a sense of the flight of time was jimmy glover shouting
from the top of a patriarchal old spruce â€œmasterâ€™s coming.â€

the girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the
schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare. the boy

 the singing and her dramatic
ability in the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour. ruby gillis
smuggled three blue plums over to her during testament reading; ella may
macpherson gave her an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a
floral catalogue--a species of desk decoration much prized in avonlea
school. sophia sloane offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new
pattern of knit lace, so nice for trimming aprons. katie boulter gave
her a perfume bottle to keep slate water in, and julia bell copied
carefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the edges the
following effusion:


  when twilight drops her curtain down
  and pins it with a star
  remember that you have a friend
  though she may wander far.


â€œitâ€™s so nice to be appreciated,â€ sighed anne rapturously to marilla
that night.

the girls were not the only scholars who â€œappreciatedâ€ her. when anne
went to her seat after dinner hour--she had been told by mr. phillips to

through the orchard with her hair streaming. itâ€™ll be a mercy if she
doesnâ€™t catch her death of cold.â€

anne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy
places. afar in the southwest was the great shimmering, pearl-like
sparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal
rose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce. the tinkles
of sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through
the frosty air, but their music was not sweeter than the song in anneâ€™s
heart and on her lips.

â€œyou see before you a perfectly happy person, marilla,â€ she announced.
â€œiâ€™m perfectly happy--yes, in spite of my red hair. just at present i
have a soul above red hair. mrs. barry kissed me and cried and said she
was so sorry and she could never repay me. i felt fearfully embarrassed,

then dianaâ€™s cousins, the murrays from newbridge, came; they all crowded
into the big pung sleigh, among straw and furry robes. anne reveled in
the drive to the hall, slipping along over the satin-smooth roads with
the snow crisping under the runners. there was a magnificent sunset, and
the snowy hills and deep-blue water of the st. lawrence gulf seemed to
rim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with
wine and fire. tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter, that seemed
like the mirth of wood elves, came from every quarter.

â€œoh, diana,â€ breathed anne, squeezing dianaâ€™s mittened hand under the
fur robe, â€œisnâ€™t it all like a beautiful dream? do i really look the
same as usual? i feel so different that it seems to me it must show in
my looks.â€

â€œyou look awfully nice,â€ said diana, who having just received a
compliment from one of her cousins, felt that she ought to pass it on.
â€œyouâ€™ve got the loveliest color

her fancy lurked in every shadow about her, reaching out their cold,
fleshless hands to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them
into being. a white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over
the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still. the long-drawn
wail of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the
perspiration in beads on her forehead. the swoop of bats in the darkness
over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures. when she reached mr.
william bellâ€™s field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of
white things, and arrived at the barry kitchen door so out of breath
that she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern.
diana was away so that she had no excuse to linger. the dreadful
return journey had to be faced. anne went back over it with shut eyes,
preferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs
to that of seeing a white thing. when she finally stumbled over the log
bridge she drew one long shi

before that religion was such a cheerful thing. i always thought it
was kind of melancholy, but mrs. allanâ€™s isnâ€™t, and iâ€™d like to be a
christian if i could be one like her. i wouldnâ€™t want to be one like mr.

â€œitâ€™s very naughty of you to speak so about mr. bell,â€ said marilla
severely. â€œmr. bell is a real good man.â€

â€œoh, of course heâ€™s good,â€ agreed anne, â€œbut he doesnâ€™t seem to get any
comfort out of it. if i could be good iâ€™d dance and sing all day because
i was glad of it. i suppose mrs. allan is too old to dance and sing and
of course it wouldnâ€™t be dignified in a ministerâ€™s wife. but i can just
feel sheâ€™s glad sheâ€™s a christian and that sheâ€™d be one even if

mile was almost too much happiness for this world.

matthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness
and anne knew how. he had been in such a state of shyness and
nervousness that marilla had given him up in despair, but anne took him
in hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes
and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly.
he never said a word to mrs. allan, but that perhaps was not to be
expected.

all went merry as a marriage bell until anneâ€™s layer cake was passed.
mrs. allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety,
declined it. but marilla, seeing the disappointment on anneâ€™s face, said
smilingly:

â€œoh, you must take a piece of this, mrs. allan. anne made it on purpose
for you.â€

â€œin that case i must sample it,â€ laughed mrs. allan, helping herself to
a plump triangle, as did also the minister and marilla.

mrs. allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression

the schoolgirls dropping in to bring her flowers and books and tell her
all the happenings in the juvenile world of avonlea.

on the day when she could first limp across the floor. â€œit isnâ€™t very
pleasant to be laid up; but there is a bright side to it, marilla. you
find out how many friends you have. why, even superintendent bell came
to see me, and heâ€™s really a very fine man. not a kindred spirit, of
course; but still i like him and iâ€™m awfully sorry i ever criticized his
prayers. i believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into
the habit of saying them as if he didnâ€™t. he could get over that if heâ€™d
take a little trouble. i gave him a good broad hint. i told him how hard
i tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. he told me

so strange to think of superintendent bell ever being a boy. even my

mrs. allan as a little girl. mrs. allan has been to see me fourteen

â€œwell now, you might recite it for me some of these days, out in the

â€œof course i will,â€ said anne meditatively, â€œbut i wonâ€™t be able to do
it so well, i know. it wonâ€™t be so exciting as it is when you have a
whole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your words. i know i
wonâ€™t be able to make your blood run cold.â€

â€œmrs. lynde says it made _her_ blood run cold to see the boys climbing to
the very tops of those big trees on bellâ€™s hill after crowsâ€™ nests last
friday,â€ said marilla. â€œi wonder at miss stacy for encouraging it.â€

â€œbut we wanted a crowâ€™s nest for nature study,â€ explained anne. â€œthat
was on our field afternoon. field afternoons are splendid, marilla.
and miss stacy explains everything so beautifully. we have to write
compositions on our field afternoons and i write the best ones.â€

splendid thing about such affairs--itâ€™s so lovely to look back to them.â€

eventually, however, avonlea school slipped back into its old groove
and took up its old interests. to be sure, the concert left traces. ruby
gillis and emma white, who had quarreled over a point of precedence in
their platform seats, no longer sat at the same desk, and a promising
friendship of three years was broken up. josie pye and julia bell did

that julia bellâ€™s bow when she got up to recite made her think of a
chicken jerking its head, and bessie told julia. none of the sloanes

that the sloanes had too much to do in the program, and the sloanes had
retorted that the bells were not capable of doing the little they had to

human and have their besetting sins just like everybody

sins last sunday afternoon. there are just a few things itâ€™s proper
to talk about on sundays and that is one of them. my besetting sin is
imagining too much and forgetting my duties. iâ€™m striving very hard
to overcome it and now that iâ€™m really thirteen perhaps iâ€™ll get on
better.â€

â€œin four more years weâ€™ll be able to put our hair up,â€ said diana.
â€œalice bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but i think
thatâ€™s ridiculous. i shall wait until iâ€™m seventeen.â€

â€œif i had alice bellâ€™s crooked nose,â€ said anne decidedly, â€œi
wouldnâ€™t--but there! i wonâ€™t say what i was going to because it was
extremely uncharitable. besides, i was comparing it with my own nose and
thatâ€™s vanity. iâ€™m afraid i think too much about my nose ever since i
heard that compliment about it long ago. it really is a great comfort to
me. oh, diana, look,

they were standing on the bank of the pond, below orchard slope, where
a little headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank; at its tip
was a small wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience
of fishermen and duck hunters. ruby and jane were spending the midsummer
afternoon with diana, and anne had come over to play with them.

anne and diana had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about
the pond. idlewild was a thing of the past, mr. bell having ruthlessly
cut down the little circle of trees in his back pasture in the spring.
anne had sat among the stumps and wept, not without an eye to the
romance of it; but she was speedily consoled, for, after all, as she and
diana said, big girls of thirteen, going on fourteen, were too old for
such childish amusements as playhouses, and there were more fascinating
sports to be found about the pond. it was splendid to fish for trout
over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves

 as anne told marilla afterward. the two little country girls were rather
abashed by the splendor of the parlor where miss barry left them when
she went to see about dinner.

â€œisnâ€™t it just like a palace?â€ whispered diana. â€œi never was in aunt
josephineâ€™s house before, and iâ€™d no idea it was so grand. i just wish
julia bell could see this--she puts on such airs about her motherâ€™s
parlor.â€

â€œvelvet carpet,â€ sighed anne luxuriously, â€œand silk curtains! iâ€™ve
dreamed of such things, diana. but do you know i donâ€™t believe i feel
very comfortable with them after all. there are so many things in this
room and all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination. that is
one consolation when you are poor--there are so many more things you can
imagine about.â€

it was splendid,â€ anne related to marilla later on. â€œi never imagined
anything so interesting. i donâ€™t really know which department was the
most interesting. i think i liked the horses and the flowers and the
fancywork best. josie pye took first prize for knitted lace. i was
real glad she did. and i was glad that i felt glad, for it shows iâ€™m
improving, donâ€™t you think, marilla, when i can rejoice in josieâ€™s
success? mr. harmon andrews took second prize for gravenstein apples
and mr. bell took first prize for a pig. diana said she thought it was
ridiculous for a sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs,
but i donâ€™t see why. do you? she said she would always think of it after
this when he was praying so solemnly. clara louise macpherson took a
prize for painting, and mrs. lynde got first prize for homemade butter
and cheese. so avonlea was pretty well represented, wasnâ€™t it? mrs.

gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last
moonlight night and did it. diana wouldnâ€™t say much about that, though.
diana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about
imagining ghosts into the haunted wood. it had a very bad effect on
dianaâ€™s imagination. it blighted it. mrs. lynde says myrtle bell is a
blighted being. i asked ruby gillis why myrtle was blighted, and ruby
said she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her. ruby
gillis thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse
she is. young men are all very well in their place, but it doesnâ€™t do to
drag them into everything, does it? diana and i are thinking seriously
of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids
and live together forever. diana hasnâ€™t quite made up her m
