 king, such reason as nature may have given abides not with the unfortunate, but goes astray.

creon
thine did, when thou chosest vile deeds with the vile.

ismene
what life could i endure, without her presence?

creon
nay, speak not of her 'presence'; she lives no more.

ismene
but wilt thou slay the betrothed of thine own son?

creon
nay, there are other fields for him to plough.

ismene
but there can never be such love as bound him to her.

creon
i like not an evil wife for my son.

antigone
haemon, beloved! how thy father wrongs thee!

creon
enough, enough of thee and of thy marriage!

leader of the chorus
wilt thou indeed rob thy son of this maiden?

creon
'tis death that shall stay these bridals for me.

leader
'tis determined, it seems, that she shall die.

creon
determined, yes, for thee and for me.-

antistrophe 2

for that hope whose wanderings are so wide is to many men a comfort, but to many a false lure of giddy desires; and the disappointment comes on one who knoweth nought till he burn his foot against the hot fire. 

for with wisdom hath some one given forth the famous saying, that evil seems good, soon or late, to him whose mind the god draws to mischief; and but for the briefest space doth he fare free of woe.

leader of the chorus
but lo, haemon, the last of thy sons;-comes he grieving for the doom of his promised bride, antigone, and bitter for the baffled hope of his marriage?
enter haemon

creon
we shall know soon, better than seers could tell us.-my son, hearing the fixed doom of thy betrothed, art thou come in rage against thy father? or have i thy good will, act how i may?

haemon
father, i am thine; and thou, in thy wisdom, tracest for me rules which i shall follow. no marriage shall be deemed by me a greater gain than thy good

ils. this it is that ruins cities; this makes homes desolate; by this, the ranks of allies are broken into head-long rout; but, of the lives whose course is fair, the greater part owes safety to obedience. therefore we must support the cause of order, and in no wise suffer a woman to worst us. better to fall from power, if we must, by a man's hand; then we should not be called weaker than a woman.

leader
to us, unless our years have stolen our wit, thou seemest to say wisely what thou sayest.

haemon
father, the gods implant reason in men, the highest of all things that we call our own. not mine the skill-far from me be the quest!-to say wherein thou speakest not aright; and yet another man, too, might have some useful thought. at least, it is my natural office to watch, on thy behalf, all that men say, or do, or find to blame. for the dread of thy frown forbids the citizen to speak such words as would offend thine ear; but can hear these murmurs in the dark, these moanings of the city for

hus he who keeps the sheet of his sail taut, and never slackens it, upsets his boat, and finishes his voyage with keel uppermost. 

nay, forego thy wrath; permit thyself to change. for if i, a younger man, may offer my thought, it were far best, i ween, that men should be all-wise by nature; but, otherwise-and oft the scale inclines not so-'tis good also to learn from those who speak aright.

leader
sire, 'tis meet that thou shouldest profit by his words, if he speaks aught in season, and thou, haemon, by thy father's; for on both parts there hath been wise speech.

creon
men of my age are we indeed to be schooled, then, by men of his?

haemon
in nothing that is not right; but if i am young, thou shouldest look to my merits, not to my years.

creon
is it a merit to honour the unruly?

haemon
i could wish no one to show respect for evil-doers.

creon
then is not she tainted with that malady?

haemon
our theban folk, with one voice, denies it.

creon

haemon
see, there thou hast spoken like a youth indeed.

creon
am i to rule this land by other judgment than mine own?

haemon
that is no city which belongs to one man.

creon
is not the city held to be the ruler's?

haemon
thou wouldst make a good monarch of a desert.

creon
this boy, it seems, is the woman's champion.

haemon
if thou art a woman; indeed, my care is for thee.

creon
shameless, at open feud with thy father!

haemon
nay, i see thee offending against justice.

creon
do i offend, when i respect mine own prerogatives?

haemon
thou dost not respect them, when thou tramplest on the gods' honours,

creon
o dastard nature, yielding place to woman!

haemon
thou wilt never find me yield to baseness.

creon
all thy words, at least, plead for that girl.

haemon
and for thee, and for me, and for the gods below.

creon
thou canst never marry her, on this side the grave.

haemon
then she must die, and in death destroy a

creon
how! doth thy boldness run to open threats?

haemon
what threat is it, to combat vain resolves?

creon
thou shalt rue thy witless teaching of wisdom.

haemon
wert thou not my father, i would have called thee unwise.

creon
thou woman's slave, use not wheedling speech with me.

haemon
thou wouldest speak, and then hear no reply?

creon
sayest thou so? now, by the heaven above us-be sure of it-thou shalt smart for taunting me in this opprobrious strain. bring forth that hated thing, that she may die forthwith in his presence-before his eyes-at her bridegroom's side!

haemon
no, not at my side-never think it-shall she perish; nor shalt thou ever set eyes more upon my face:-rave, then, with such friends as can endure thee.

 when a man hath forfeited his pleasures, i count him not as living,-i hold him but a breathing corpse. heap up riches in thy house, if thou wilt; live in kingly state; yet, if there be no gladness therewith, i would not give the shadow of a vapour for all the rest, compared with joy.

leader of the chorus
and what is this new grief that thou hast to tell for our princes?

messenger
death; and the living are guilty for the dead.

leader
and who is the slayer? who the stricken? speak.

messenger
haemon hath perished; his blood hath been shed by no stranger.

leader
by his father's hand, or by his own?

messenger
by his own, in wrath with his sire for the murder.

leader
o prophet, how true, then, hast thou proved thy word!

messenger
these things stand thus; ye must consider of the rest.

leader
lo, i see the hapless eurydice, creon's wife, approaching; she comes from the house by chance, haply,-or because she knows the tidings of her son.

at bride's unhallowed bower; and came to tell our master creon. 

and as the king drew nearer, doubtful sounds of a bitter cry floated around him; he groaned, and said in accents of anguish, 'wretched that i am, can my foreboding be true? am i going on the wofullest way that ever i went? my son's voice greets me.-go, my servants,-haste ye nearer, and when ye have reached the tomb, pass through the gap, where the stones have been wrenched away, to the cell's very mouth,-and look. and see if 'tis haemon's voice that i know, or if mine ear is cheated by the gods.' 

this search, at our despairing master's word, we went to make; and in the furthest part of the tomb we descried her hanging by the neck, slung by a thread-wrought halter of fine linen: while he was embracing her with arms thrown around her waist, bewailing the loss of his bride who is with the dead, and his father's deeds, and his own ill-starred love. 

but his father, when he saw him, cried aloud with a dread cry and went in, and

leader
i know not; but to me, at least, a strained silence seems to portend peril, no less than vain abundance of lament.

messenger
well, i will enter the house, and learn whether indeed she is not hiding some repressed purpose in the depths of a passionate heart. yea, thou sayest well: excess of silence, too, may have a perilous meaning.
the messenger goes into the palace. enter creon, on the spectators' left, with attendants, carrying the shrouded body of haemon on bier. the following lines between creon and the chorus are chanted responsively.

chorus
lo, yonder the king himself draws near, bearing that which tells too clear a tale,-the work of no stranger's madness,-if we may say it,-but of his own misdeeds.
