i am not bookish, yet i can read waiting-gentlewoman in the

tore out his shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help, and said
his name was antigonus, a nobleman.--but to make an end of the
ship,--to see how the sea flap-dragon'd it:--but first, how the
poor souls roared, and the sea mocked them;--and how the poor
gentleman roared, and the bear mocked him,--both roaring louder
than the sea or weather.

my father named me autolycus; who being, i as am, littered under
mercury, was likewise a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. with
die and drab i purchased this caparison; and my revenue is the

clown.
indeed, he should be a footman, by the garments he has left

service. lend me thy hand, i'll help thee: come, lend me thy

clown.
what manner of fellow was he that robbed you?

autolycus.
a fellow, sir, that i have known to go about with troll-my-dames;
i knew him once a servant of the prince; i cannot tell, good sir,
for which of his virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out
of the court.

clown.
his vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped out of the
court: they cherish it, to make it stay there; and yet it will no
more but abide.

autolycus.
vices, i would say, sir. i know this man well: he hath been
since an ape-bearer; then a process-server, a bailiff; then he
compassed a motion of the prodigal son, and married a tinker's
wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and, having
flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue:

autolycus.
very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that put me into
this apparel.

clown.
not a more cowardly rogue in all bohemia; if you had but looked
big and spit at him, he'd have run.

autolycus.
i must confess to you, sir, i am no fighter: i am false of heart
that way; and that he knew, i warrant him.

clown.
how do you now?

autolycus.
sweet sir, much better than i was; i can stand and walk: i will
even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman's.

shall i bring thee on the way?

fie, daughter! when my old wife liv'd, upon
this day she was both pantler, butler, cook;
both dame and servant; welcom'd all; serv'd all;
would sing her song and dance her turn; now here
at upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
on his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
with labour, and the thing she took to quench it
she would to each one sip. you are retir'd,
as if you were a feasted one, and not

                         i'll swear for 'em.

polixenes.
this is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
but smacks of something greater than herself,
too noble for this place.

camillo.
                          he tells her something
that makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
the queen of curds and cream.

shepherd.
so she does anything; though i report it,
that should be silent; if young doricles
do light upon her, she shall bring him that
which he not dreams of.

[enter a servant.]

servant.
o master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the door, you
would never dance again after a tabor and pipe; no, the bagpipe
could not move you: he sings several tunes faster than you'll
tell money: he utters them as he had eaten ballads, and all men's
ears grew to his tunes.

clown.
he could never come better: he shall come in. i love a ballad
but even too well, if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or
a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably.

servant.
he hath songs for man or woman of all sizes; no milliner can so
fit his customers with gloves: he has the prettiest love-songs
for maids; so without bawdry, which is strange; with such
delicate burdens of 'dildos' and 'fadings', 'jump her and thump
her'; and where some stretch-mouth'd rascal would, as

 it were,
mean mischief, and break a foul gap into the matter, he makes the
maid to answer 'whoop, do me no harm, good man',--puts him off,
slights him, with 'whoop, do me no harm, good man.'

polixenes.
this is a brave fellow.

clown.
believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow.
has he any unbraided wares?

servant.
he hath ribbons of all the colours i' the rainbow; points, more
than all the lawyers in bohemia can learnedly handle, though
they come to him by the gross; inkles, caddisses, cambrics,
lawns; why he sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses;
you would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants to the
sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.

here's another ballad, of a fish that appeared upon the coast
on wednesday the fourscore of april, forty thousand fathom
above water, and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of
maids: it was thought she was a woman, and was turned into a
cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved
her. the ballad is very pitiful, and as true.

let's have some merry ones.

autolycus.
why, this is a passing merry one, and goes to the tune of 'two
maids wooing a man.' there's scarce a maid westward but she sings
it: 'tis in request, i can tell you.

mopsa.
we can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou shalt hear;
'tis in three parts.

 ha! what a fool honesty is! and trust, his sworn brother,
a very simple gentleman! i have sold all my trumpery; not a
counterfeit stone, not a riband, glass, pomander, brooch,
table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet,
horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting;--they throng who should
buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed, and brought a
benediction to the buyer: by which means i saw whose purse was
best in picture; and what i saw, to my good use i remembered. my
clown (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in
love with the wenches' song that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the rest of the
herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears: you might
have pinched a placket,--it was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld
a codpiece of a purse; i would have filed keys off that hung in
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song, and admiring
the nothing of it. so that, in this time of let

at us, and we may do anything extempore. the prince himself is
about a piece of iniquity,--stealing away from his father with
his clog at his heels: if i thought it were a piece of honesty
to acquaint the king withal, i would not do't: i hold it the
more knavery to conceal it; and therein am i constant to my

indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been

none but tradesmen, and they often give us soldiers the lie:
but we pay them for it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel;
therefore they do not give us the lie.

push on or pluck back thy business there: whereupon i command
thee to open thy affair.

shepherd.
my business, sir, is to the king.

autolycus.
what advocate hast thou to him?

i know not, an't like you.

advocate's the court-word for a pheasant; say you have none.

yet nature might have made me as these are,
therefore i will not disdain.

the king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new ship to
purge melancholy and air himself: for, if thou beest capable of
things serious, thou must know the king is full of grief.

shepherd.
so 'tis said, sir,--about his son, that should have married a
shepherd's daughter.

autolycus.
if that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly: the curses he
shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of
man, the heart of monster.

clown.
think you so, sir?

autolycus.
not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance
bitter; but those that are germane to him, though removed fifty
times, shall all come under the hangman: which, though it be
great pity, yet it is necessary. an old sheep-whistling rogue, a
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into grace! some
say he shall be stoned; but that death is too soft for him, say

he has a son,--who shall be flayed alive; then 'nointed over
with honey, set on the head of a wasp's nest; then stand till
he be three quarters and a dram dead; then recovered again with
aqua-vitæ or some other hot infusion; then, raw as he is, and
in the hottest day prognostication proclaims, shall he be set
against a brick wall, the sun looking with a southward eye upon
him,--where he is to behold him wi

what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to
be smiled at, their offences being so capital? tell me,--for you
seem to be honest plain men,--what you have to the king: being
something gently considered, i'll bring you where he is aboard,
tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs;
and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits, here
is man shall do it.

he seems to be of great authority: close with him, give him gold;
and though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the
nose with gold: show the inside of your purse to the outside of
his hand, and no more ado. remember,--ston'd and flayed alive.

shepherd.
an't please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is
that gold i have: i'll make it as much more, and leave this young
man in pawn till i bring it you.

ay, sir.

autolycus.
well, give me the moiety. are you a party in this business?

clown.
in some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful one, i hope i
shall not be flayed out of it.

autolycus.
o, that's the case of the shepherd's son. hang him, he'll be made
an example.

clown.
comfort, good comfort! we must to the king and show our strange
sights. he must know 'tis none of your daughter nor my sister; we
are gone else. sir, i will give you as much as this old man does,
when the business is performed; and remain, as he says, your pawn
till it be brought you.

autolycus.
i will trust you. walk before toward the sea-side; go on the
right-hand; i will but look upon the hedge, and follow you.

clown.
we are blessed in this man, as i may say, even blessed.

autolycus.
if i had a mind to be honest, i see fortune would not suffer me:
she drops booties in my mouth. i am courted now with a double
occasion,--gold, and a means to do the prince my master good;
which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? i will
bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he think
it fit to shore them again, and that the complaint they have to
the king concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so
far officious; for i am pr

and i know not
what; but he at that time over-fond of the shepherd's daughter,--
so he then took her to be,--who began to be much sea-sick, and
himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this
mystery remained undiscover'd. but 'tis all one to me; for had i
been the finder-out of this secret, it would not have relish'd
among my other discredits. here come those i have done good to

fortune.

shepherd.
come, boy; i am past more children, but thy sons and daughters
will be all gentlemen born.

you are well met, sir: you denied to fight with me this other
day, because i was no gentleman born. see you these clothes? say
you see them not and think me still no gentleman born: you were
best say these robes are not gentlemen born. give me the lie, do;
and try whether i am not now a gentleman born.

autolycus.
i know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

 and have been so any time these four hours.

shepherd.
and so have i, boy!

clown.
so you have:--but i was a gentleman born before my father; for
the king's son took me by the hand and called me brother; and
then the two kings called my father brother; and then the prince,
my brother, and the princess, my sister, called my father father;
and so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that
ever we shed.

shepherd.
we may live, son, to shed many more.

clown.
ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as
we are.

autolycus.
i humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults i have
committed to your worship, and to give me your good report to the
prince my master.

shepherd.
pr'ythee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen.

thou wilt amend thy life?

ay, an it like your good worship.

give me thy hand: i will swear to the prince thou art as honest

not swear it, now i am a gentleman? let boors and franklins say
it, i'll swear it.

shepherd.
how if it be false, son?

clown.
if it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the
behalf of his friend.--and i'll swear to the prince thou art a
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but i
know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk: but i'll swear it; and i would thou wouldst be a tall
fellow of thy hands.

autolycus.
i will prove so, sir, to my power.

clown.
ay, by any means, prove a tall fellow: if i do not wonder how
thou darest venture to be drunk,
