 to get
wet.  they  would  follow  the  trail  to  the

stream  and  stop.  sitting  down  on  their
rears,  they  would  cry  and  beg  for  help.
with a pup under each arm, iâ€™d wade out
into  the  stream  and  set  them  down  in  the
cool water. nine times out of ten, one pup
would  swim  one  way  and  the  other  one
would  go  just  the  opposite  way.  i  had  a
time with this part of their training, but my
persistence had no bounds.

it  wasnâ€™t  long  until  they  loved  the
water. old dan would jump as far out as
he  could  and  practically  knock  the  river
dry. little ann would ease herself in and
swim  like  a  muskrat  for  the  opposite
shore.

i taught my dogs every trick i knew and
any new ones i heard about. i taught them
how  to  split  up  on  a  riverbank  to  search
for  the  hidden  trail,  because  it  was

impossible  to  tell  where  a  coon  would
come  out  of  the  water.  sometimes  he
might  swim  downstream  and  other  times
he might swim upstream. maybe

â€œhe doesnâ€™t even talk to me like i was a

feel just about as big as our old red mule.
i  had  a  good  talk  with  my  dogs.  â€œiâ€™ve
waited almost three years for this night,â€ i
said, â€œand it hasnâ€™t been easy. iâ€™ve taught
you  everything  i  know  and  i  want  you  to
do your best.â€

little  ann  acted  like  she  understood.
she whined and saved me a wash job on

act  like  it.  he  just  lay  there  in  the

  smiling.  i  knew  that
never again would a ringtail fool them by
swimming the river.

the next trick the old fellow pulled was
dandy.  he  climbed  a  large  water  oak
standing about ten feet from the river and
simply disappeared.

i  got  there  in  time  to  see  my  dogs
swimming for the opposite shore. for half
an hour they worked that bank. not finding
the  trail,  they  swam  back.  i  stood  and
watched  them.  they  practically  tore  the
riverbank to pieces looking for the trail.

old dan knew the coon had climbed the
water oak. he went back, reared up on it,
and bawled a few times.

â€œthereâ€™s  no  use  in  doing  that,  boy,â€  i
said.  â€œi  know  he  climbed  it,  but  heâ€™s  not
there now. maybe itâ€™s like grandpa said,
he just climbed right on out through the top
and disappeared in the stars.â€

my dogs didnâ€™t know it, but i was pretty
well  convinced  that  that  was  what  the
coon had done.

they wouldnâ€™t give up. once again they

walking around it, and using the moon
as  a  light,  i  started  looking  for  the  coon.
high up in the top i saw a hollow in the
end  of  a  broken  limb.  i  figured  that  that
was the coonâ€™s den.

i could climb almost any tree i had ever
seen  but  i  knew  i  could  never  climb  the
big  sycamore  and  it  would  take  days  to
chop it down.

i turned to walk away. my hounds made
no move to follow. they started whining.
old dan reared up, placed his front paws
on the trunk, and started bawling.

â€œi know heâ€™s there,â€ i said, â€œbut thereâ€™s
nothing i can do. i canâ€™t climb it. why itâ€™s
sixty feet up to the first limb and it would
take me a month to cut it down.â€

there had been very little hope from the
beginning, but on seeing the hollow i gave
up.  â€œcome  on,â€  i  said  to  my  dogs.
â€œthereâ€™s  nothing  i  can  do.  weâ€™ll  go
someplace else and find another coon.â€

again i turned and started on

mama said. â€œiâ€™d no idea coons were that

there  wasnâ€™t  any  use  in  building  that

dan to stay and watch the tree.â€

would  stop  and  whoop.  each  time  i  was

little ann ran ahead of me. by the time
i  reached  the  big  tree,  their  voices  were
making the bottoms ring.

underbrush, old dan threw a fit. he tried
to  climb  the  sycamore.  he  would  back

as he could, he would claw his way far up
on its side.

little ann, not to be outdone, reared up
and  placed  her  small  front  paws  on  the
smooth  white  bark.  she  told  the  ringtail
coon that she knew he was t

i  was  trying  hard  to  get  in  a  lick  with
my  club  but  couldnâ€™t  for  fear  of  hitting
little ann. through the tears in my eyes i
saw  the  red  blurry  form  of  old  dan  sail
into  the  fight.  he  was  a  mad  hound.  his
anger at the bur oak tree was taken out on
the coon.

they  stretched  old  ringy  out  between
them and pinned him to the ground. it was
savage  and  brutal.  i  could  hear  the  dying
squalls of the coon and the deep growls of
old dan. in a short time it was all over.

with  sorrow  in  my  heart,  i  stood  and
watched  while  my  dogs  worried  the
lifeless  body.  little  ann  was  satisfied

it wasnâ€™t too hard for a smart old coon
to fool old dan, but there were none that
prowled the riverbanks that could fool my
little ann.

as grandpa had predicted, the price of
coonskins  jumped  sky-high.  a  good-size
hide  was  worth  from  four  to  ten  dollars,
depending on the grade and quality.

young  boy,  i  wasnâ€™t  bothered  by  it  and  i
asked no questions.

my  whole  life  was  wrapped  up  in  my
dogs. everywhere i went they went along.
there  was  only  one  place  i  didnâ€™t  want
them  to  go  with  me  and  that  was  to

it  got  so  about  the  only  time  i  went  to
see  my  grandfather  was  when  i  had  a
bundle of fur to take to the store. this was

always a problem. in every way i could, i
would  try  to  slip  away  from  my  dogs.
sometimes  i  swore  that  they  could  read
my  mind.  it  made  no  difference  what  i
tried; i couldnâ€™t fool them.

taking my furs, i sneaked out through a
back  door  and,  walking  like  a  tomcat,  i
made  it  to  the  timber.  i  climbed  a  small
dogwood

e.  although  he  wasnâ€™t  a  tall
dog, he was heavy. his body was long and
his  chest  broad  and  thick.  his  legs  were
short,  big,  and  solid.  the  muscles  in  his
body  were  hard  and  knotty.  when  he
walked,  they  would  twist  and  jerk  under
the skin.

he was a friendly dog. there were no
strangers to him. he loved everyone. yet

he was a strange dog. he would not hunt
with another hound, other than little ann,
or another hunter, not even my father. the
strangest thing about old dan was that he
would  not  hunt,  even  with  me,  unless
little ann was with him. i found this out
the first night i tried it.

little ann  had  cut  the  pad  of  her  right
foot on a sharp jagged flint rock. it was a
nasty  cut.  i  made  a  little  boot  of  leather
and  put  it  on  her  wounded  foot.  to  keep
her from following me, i locked her in the
corncrib.

two nights later i decided to take old
dan hunting for a while. he followed me

and
disappeared  in  the  thick  timber.  i

knowing  he  would  have  to  come  out
somewhere,  my  dogs  split  up.  old  dan
took the right side. little ann worked the
other side. i came out of the bottoms onto
a gravel bar and stood and watched them
in the moonlight.

little ann worked downriver, and then
she came up. i saw her when she passed
me  going  up
the  bank,  sniffing  and
searching  for  the  trail.  she  came  back  to
me. i patted her head, scratched her ears,
and talked to her. she kept staring across
the river to where old dan was searching
for the trail.

she waded in and swam across to help
him. i knew that the coon had not come out
of  the  river  on  her  side.  if  he  had,  she
would have found the trail. i walked up to

a  riffle,  pulled  off  my  shoes,  and  waded
across.

my dogs worked the riverbank, up and
down.  they  circled  far  out  into  the
bottoms. i could hear the loud snuffing of
old dan. he was bewildered and mad. i

i could hear her sniffing and whining. i
couldnâ€™t  figure  out  where  old  dan  was.
by squatting down and holding the lantern
high over my head, i could dimly see the

opposite bank. little ann was running up
and down. i noticed she always stayed in
one  place  of  about  twenty-five  yards,
never leaving that small area.

she  ran  down  to  the  waterâ€™s  edge  and
stared  out  into  the  slough.  the  horrible
thought came that old dan had drowned. i
knew a big coon was capable of drowning
a  dog  in  water  by  climbing  on  his  head
and forcing him under.

as  fast  as  i  could  run,  i  circled  the
slough,  climbed  up  over  the  bluff,  and
came down to where little ann was. she
was  hysterical,  running  up  and  down  the
bank and whining.

i tied my lantern on a long pole, held it
out  over  the  water,  and  looked  for  old
danâ€™s  body.  i  could  see  clearly  in  the

looked around. she was ten feet from the
waterâ€™s  edge.  i  got  up  and  went  over  to
her. she was digging in a small hole about
the size of a big apple. it was the air hole
for a muskrat den.

i pulled little ann away from the hole,
knelt  down,  and  put  my  ear  to  it.  i  could
hear something, and feel a vibration in the
ground. it was an eerie sound and seemed
to  be  coming  from  far  away.  i  listened.
finally i understood what the noise was.

it was the voice of old dan. little ann
had  opened  the  hole  up  enough  with  her
digging  so  his  voice  could  be  heard
faintly. in some way he had gotten into that
old muskrat den.

i knew that down under the bank, in the
water,  the  entrance  to  the  den  could  be
found. rolling up my sleeve, i tried to find
it with my hand. i had no luck. it was too
far down.

there was only one thing to do. leaving

iâ€™ve  often  wondered  how  old  dan  got
into  that  old  muskrat  den.  perhaps  there
was  another  entrance  i  had  overlooked.
iâ€™ll never know.

one night, far back in the mountains, in
a  place  called  â€œthe  cyclone  timber,â€
old dan really pulled a good one.

many  years  before  my  time,  a  terrible
cyclone  had  ripped  its  way  through  the
mountains, leaving its scar in the form of
fallen  timber,  twisted  and  snarled.  the
path  of  the  cyclone  was  several  miles
wide  and  several  miles  long.  it  was
wonderful  place  to  hunt  as  it  abounded
with game.

my dogs had struck the trail of a coon
about  an  hour  before.  they  had  really
been warming him up. i knew it was about
time  for  him  to  take  up

  a  tree,  and  sure
enough, i heard the deep voice of old dan
telling the world he had a coon up a tree.

i  was  trotting  along,  going  to  them,
when  his  voice  stopped.  i  could  hear

little ann,  but  not  old  dan.  i  wondered
why,  and  was  a  little  scared,  for  i  just
knew  something  had  happened.  then  i
heard  his  voice.  it  seemed  louder  than  it
had been before. i felt much better.

when  i  came  up  to  the  tree  i  thought
little  ann  had  treed  old  dan.  she  was
sitting  on  her  haunches  staring  up  and
bawling

the  tree  bark.  there,  a  good
fifteen feet from the ground, with his hind
legs  planted  firmly  in  the  center  of  a  big
limb, and his front feet against the trunk of
the tree, stood old dan, bawling for all he
was worth.

above him some eight or nine feet was
a  baby  coon.  i  was  glad  it  was  a  young
one,  for  if  it  had  been  an  old  one,  he
would  have  jumped  out.  old  dan  would
have followed, and he surely would have

broken all of his legs.

from where i was standing, i could see
it  was  impossible  for  old  dan  to  have
climbed the tree. it was dead and more of
an  old  snag  than  a  tree,  with  limbs  that
were  crooked  and  twisted.  the  bark  had

the  coon  into  jumping  out.  if  he  did,  old
dan would jump, too, and break his legs.
i ran plan after plan around in my mind.
none  would  work.  i  finally  came  to  the
conclusion that i had to climb the tree and
get ahold of that crazy dog. i blew out my
lantern,  pulled  off  my  shoes  and  socks,
and started shinnying up the tree. i prayed
that the coon wouldnâ€™t jump out.

inching along, being as quiet as i could,

i made it up to old dan and grabbed his
collar.  i  sat  down  on  the  limb,  and  held
him  tight.  he  would  bawl  now  and  then,
and all but burst my eardrums. i couldnâ€™t
drop  him  to  the  ground,  and  i  couldnâ€™t
climb down with him. i couldnâ€™t sit there
on  that  limb  and  hold  him  all  night.  i
would  be  no  better  off  when  daylight
came.

glancing  at  the  hole  by  my  side  gave
me the solution to my problem. i thought,
â€œif  he  came  out  of  this  hole,  he  can  go
back in it.â€

at  was  the  way  i  got  my  dog  down
from the tree. this had its problems, too.
in the first place, old dan didnâ€™t want to
be put in the hole head first. by scolding,
pushing,  shoving,  and  squeezing,  i  finally
got him started on his way.

like  a  fool,  i  sat  there  on  the  limb,
waiting to see him come out at the bottom,
and  come  out  he  did.  turning  around,
bawling  as  he  did,  right  back  in  the  hole
he went. there was nothing i could do but
sit  and  wait.  i  understood  why  his  voice
had stopped for a while. he just took time
out to climb a tree.

he tip end of his long tail disappearing. i
grabbed  it.  holding  on  with  one  hand,  i
worked his legs down with my other, and
pulled him out. i stopped his tree-climbing
by  cramming  rocks  and  chunks  into  the
hole.

how  the  coon  stayed  in  the  tree,  iâ€™ll
never know, but stay he did. with a well-
aimed  rock,  i  scared  him  out.  old  dan
satisfied his lust to kill.

i  started  for  home.  iâ€™d  had  all  the

hunting i wanted for that night.

xi

i had often wondered what old dan would do
if  little  ann  got  into  some  kind  of  a
predicament. one night i got my answer.

for  several  days  a  northern  blizzard
had been blowing. it was a bad one. the
temperature  dropped  down  to  ten  below.
the storm started with a slow cold drizzle
and  then  sleet.  when  the  wind  started
blowing,  everything  froze,  leaving  the
ground as slick as glass.

trapped indoors, i was as nervous as a
fish out of water. i told mama i guessed it
was just going to storm all winter.

between  the  eyes.  this  did  rile  me  up.  i
didnâ€™t like to be kissed like that. it seemed
that i could practically rub my skin off and
still feel it, all wet and sticky, and kind of
burning.

sometime  on  the  fifth  night,  the  storm
blew itself out and it snowed about three
inches. the next morning i went out to my
doghouse.  scraping  the  snow  away  from
the  two-way  door,  i  stuck  my  head  in.  it
was  as  warm  as  an  oven.  i  got  my  face
washed all over by little ann. old danâ€™s
tail thumped out a tune on the wall.

i  told  them  to  be  ready  because  we
were  going  hunting  that  night.  i  knew  the
old ringtails would be hungry and stirring
for  they  had  been  denned  up  during  the

break a leg.â€

between  our  house  and  me.  i  heard
screaming and yelling from my sisters. my
father started whooping.

i knew my whole family was out on the
porch  listening  to  the  beautiful  voices  of
my  little  red  hounds.  i  felt  as  tall  as  the
tallest sycamore on the riverbank. i yelled
as  loud  as  i  could.  again  i  heard  the
squealing  of  my  sisters  and  the  shouts  of
my father.

the deep â€œou-ou-ouâ€™sâ€ of old dan and
the sharp â€œaw-aw-aw-awâ€™sâ€ of little ann
bored  a  hole  in  the  inky-black  night.  the
vibrations  rolled  and  quivered  in  the  icy
silence.

the  coon  was  heading  for  the  river.  i
could  tell  my  dogs  were  crowding  him,
and wondered if heâ€™d make it to the water.
i  was  hoping  he  wouldnâ€™t,  for  i  didnâ€™t
want to wade the cold water unless i had
to do it.

i  figured  the  smart  old  coon  had  a
reason for turning and coming back to the
river  and  wondere

 heard  a  gurgling
out in the middle of the stream. the river
wasnâ€™t frozen all the way across. the still
eddy waters next to the banks had frozen,
but  out  in  the  middle,  where  the  current
was swift, the water was running, leaving
a  trough  in  the  ice  pack.  the  gurgling
sound i had heard was the swift current as

it sucked its way through the channel.

the last time i had heard my dogs they
were  downstream  from  me.  i  walked  on,
listening.

i hadnâ€™t gone far when i heard old dan.
what i heard froze the blood in my veins.
he wasnâ€™t bawling on a trail or giving the
tree bark. it was one, long, continuous cry.
in  his  deep  voice  there  seemed  to  be  a
pleading  cry  for  help.  scared,  worried,
and  with  my  heart  beating  like  a  churn
dasher, i started toward the sound.

i  almost  passed  him  but  with  another
cry he let me know where he was. he was
out on the ice pack. i couldnâ€™t see him for
the  fog.  i  called  to  him  and  he  answered

was  dead.  she  didnâ€™t  move.  old  dan
started  whining  and  licking  her  face  and
ears. she moved her head. i started talking
to  her.  she  made  an  effort  to  stand  but
couldnâ€™t. her muscles were paralyzed and
the blood had long since ceased to flow.

at the movement of little ann, old dan
threw  a  fit.  he  started  barking  and
jumping. his long red tail fanned the air.

still  holding  onto  my  pole,  i  tried  to
take  a  step  backward.  my  feet  wouldnâ€™t
move. a cold gripping fear came over me.
i  thought  my  legs  were  frozen.  i  made
another  effort  to  lift  my  leg.  it  moved.  i

back, and looked at the pads of her feet.

i tried to talk to old dan, but i may as

around  sniffing  here  and
there.  he

rubin  and  rainie  showed  up  just  at

dark. both had sneers on their faces.

â€œyes,â€ i said, and asked him which way

was the best to go.

allen into the river.

at  that  spot,  the  bank  was  a  good  ten
feet above the water level. as the big tree
had  fallen,  the  roots  had  been  torn  and
twisted from the ground. the jagged roots,
acting  as  a  drag,  had  stopped  it  from
falling  all  the  way  into  the  stream.  the
trunk lay on a steep slant from the top of
the  bank  to  the  water.  looking  down,  i
could  see  the  broken  tangled  mass  of  the
top. debris from floods had caught in the
limbs, forming a drift.

old dan was trying to dig and gnaw his
way  into  the  log.  pulling  him  from  the
hole,  i  held  my  lantern  up  and  looked
down  into  the  dark  hollow.  i  knew  that

somewhere down below the surface there
had  to  be  another  hole  in  the  trunk,  as
water  had  filled  the  hollow  to  the  river
level.

rubin, looking over my shoulder, said,
â€œthat coon couldnâ€™t be in there. if he was,
heâ€™d be drowned.â€

i agreed.
rainie  spoke  up.  â€œyou  ready  to  pay
off?â€  he  asked.  â€

i told him the show wasnâ€™t over.
little ann had never bawled treed, and
i  knew  she  wouldnâ€™t  until  she  knew
exactly where the coon was. working the
bank  up  and  down,  and  not  finding  the
trail,  she  swam  across  the  river  and
worked  the  other  side.  for  a  good  half-
hour  she  searched  that  side  before  she

came back across to where old dan was.
she sniffed around the hollow log.

â€œwe  might  as  well  get  away  from
here,â€  rainie  said.  â€œthey  ainâ€™t  going  to
find the ghost coon.â€

â€œit sure looks that way,â€ rubin said.
i told them i wasnâ€™t giving up until my

dogs did.

â€œyou just want to be stubborn,â€ rubin

said. â€œiâ€™m ready for my money now.â€
i asked him to wait a few minutes.

under  the  overhang.  i  could  hear  her
clawing  and  wallowing  around,  and  then
all  hell  broke  loose.  out  from  under  the
bank  came  the  biggest  coon  i  had  ever
seen, the ghost coon.

he came out right over little ann. she
caught him in the old treetop. i knew she

head  shoot  up  out  of  the  water.  bawling
and clawing his way free of the limbs and
logs, he was on his way.

ghost coon was about fifteen feet ahead of

little  ann.  about
behind them came old dan, trying so hard
to catch up. i whooped to them.

rubin grabbed a pole, saying, â€œhe may

come out on this side.â€

knowing the ghost coon was desperate,
i wondered what he would do. reaching a
gravel  bar  below  the  high  bank,  we  ran
out  on  it  to  the  waterâ€™s  edge.  then  the
ghost  coon  did  something  that  i  never
expected. coming even with us, he turned
from midstream and came straight for us.
i heard rubin yell, â€œhere he comes!â€
he  churned  his  way

,  following
my  dogs.  i  thought  the  ghost  coon  was
going  back  to  the  sycamore  log  but  he
didnâ€™t. he ran upriver.

while  hurrying  after  them,  i  looked
over at rainie. for once in his life, i think
he  was  excited.  he  was  whooping  and
screaming,  and  falling  over  logs  and
limbs.

i felt good all over.
glancing  over  at  me,  rainie  said,

â€œthey ainâ€™t got him yet.â€

the  ghost  coon  crossed  the  river  time
after  time.  seeing  that  he  couldnâ€™t  shake

old dan and little ann from his trail, he
cut  through  the  river  bottoms  and  ran  out
into an old field.

at this maneuver, rubin said to rainie,

â€œheâ€™s heading for that tree.â€

â€œwhat tree?â€ i asked.
â€œyouâ€™ll  see,â€  rainie  said.  â€œwhen  he
gets  tired,  he  always  heads  for  that  tree.
thatâ€™s  where  he  gets  his  name,  the  ghost
coon. he just disappears.â€

â€œif  he  disappears,  my  dogs  will

disappear with him,â€ i said.

rainie laughed.
i had to admit one thing.

 the pritchard
boys knew the habits of the ghost coon. i
knew  he  couldnâ€™t  run  all  night.  he  had
already far surpassed any coon i had ever
chased.

â€œtheyâ€™re just about there,â€ rubin said.

just then i heard old dan bark treed. i
waited  for  little  annâ€™s  voice.  i  didnâ€™t
hear her. i wondered what it could be this
time.

â€œheâ€™s  there  all  right,â€  rubin  said.

â€œheâ€™s in that tree.â€

â€œwell, come on,â€ i said. â€œi want to see

that tree.â€

â€œyou  might  as  well  get  your  money

out,â€ rainie said.

i told him he had said that once before,

back on the riverbank.

coming up to the tree, i could see it was a huge

opposite,

in  a  whining  voice,  rainie  said,

â€œgo  ahead,â€  he  said.  â€œit  wonâ€™t  do  you

the tree was easy to climb. i looked all
over  it,  on  each  limb,  and  in  every  dark

place.  i  looked  for  a  hollow.  the  ghost
coon wasnâ€™t there. i climbed back down,
scolded old dan to stop his loud bawling,
and looked for little ann.

i  saw  her  far  up  the  old  fence  row,
sniffing and running here and there. i knew
the ghost coon had pulled a real trick, but i
couldnâ€™t figure out what it was. little ann
had never yet barked treed. i knew if the
coon was in the tree she wouldnâ€™t still be
searching for a trail.

old dan started working again.
my  dogs  covered

the  field.  they
circled and circled. they ran up and down
the barbed-wire fence on both sides.

didnâ€™t give up easily even though he was
on  dry  land.  he  was  fighting  for  his  life
and a good account he gave. he fought his
way  to  freedom,  and  made  it  back  to  the
bur oak tree. he was a good six feet up the
side  when  old  dan,  leaping  high  in  the
air, caught him and pulled him back down.
at the foot of the tree, the fight went on.

again the ghost coon fought his way free.
this  time  he  made  it  and  disappeared  in
the dark shadows of the tree. old dan was
furious.  never  before  had  i  seen  a  coon
get away from him.

i told rubin i would climb up and run
him out. as i started climbing, i saw little
ann  go  to  one  side  and  old  dan  to  the
other. my dogs would never stay together
when  they  had  treed  a  coon,  so  that  any
way he left a tree, he was met by one of
them.

about halfway up, far out on a limb, i
found the ghost coon. as i started toward
him,  my  dogs  stopped  bawling.  i  heard
something  i  had  heard  many  time
 
 ___________________________
 
i  didnâ€™t  like  that  but,  not  wanting  to

argue, i didnâ€™t say anything.

rubin  said,  â€œiâ€™ll  go  up  and  run  him

rainie  said,  â€œheâ€™s  chicken-livered,

â€œi wonâ€™t let my dogs kill him,â€ i said.
rubin glared at me. â€œiâ€™m going up and
run  that  coon  out,â€  he  said.  â€œif  you  stop
your  dogs,  iâ€™m  going  to  beat  you  half  to
death.â€

â€œdo it anyway, rubin,â€ rainie said.
â€œiâ€™ve a good mind to,â€ said rubin.
just as rubin started to climb the tree,
old dan growled. he was staring into the
darkness. something was coming.

â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€ i asked.
â€œi  donâ€™t  know,â€  rubin  said.  â€œdonâ€™t

sound like anything i ever heard.â€

â€œitâ€™s  ghosts,â€  rainie  said.  â€œletâ€™s  get

away from here.â€

an  animal  was  coming  out  of  the
darkness. it was walking slowly in an odd
way, as if it were walking sideways. the
hair on the back of my neck stood straight
out.

as the animal came closer, rainie said,
â€œwhy,  itâ€™s  old  blue.

  your  grandpa
about  this,â€  rubin  said,  â€œiâ€™ll  catch  you
hunting  some  night  and  take  my  knife  to
you.â€

looking up into his ugly face, i knew he
would do just what he said. i told him to
let  me  up  and  i  would  go  and  not  say
anything to anyone.

â€œdonâ€™t let him up, rubin,â€ rainie said.
â€œbeat the hell out of him, or hold him and
let me do it.â€

just  then  i  heard  growling,  and  a
commotion off to one side. the blue hound
had finally gotten a fight out of old dan.
turning  my  head  sideways,  i  could  see
them  standing  on  their  hind  legs,  tearing
and slashing at each other. the weight of

the big hound pushed old dan over.

i  told  rubin  to  let  me  up  so  we  could

stop the fight.

he laughed, â€œwhile my dog is whipping
yours,  i  think  iâ€™ll  just  work  you  over  a
little.â€  so  saying,  he  jerked  my  cap  off,
and started whipping me in the face with
it.

i  heard  rainie  yell,  â€œrubin,  theyâ€™re

killing old blue.â€

i clambered up and looked over to the
fight.  what  i  saw  thrilled  me.  faithful
little ann, bitch though she was, had gone
to the assistance of old dan.

i knew my dogs were very close to each
other. everything they did was done as a
combination,  but  i  never  expected  this.  it
is a very rare occasion for a bitch dog to

fight another dog, but fight she did.

i could see that little annâ€™s jaws were
glued  to  the  throat  of  the  big  hound.  she
would never loosen that deadly hold until
the last breath of life was gone.

old dan was tearing and slashing at the
soft belly. i knew the destruction his long
sharp teeth were causing.

ween  rubinâ€™s  legs.  i  saw  him
fall. i ran on by.

reaching  the  dogfight,  i  saw  the  big
hound was almost gone. he had long since
ceased  fighting.  his  body  lay  stretched
full-length  on  the  ground.  i  grabbed  old
danâ€™s collar and pulled him back. it was
different with little ann. pull as i might,
she wouldnâ€™t let go of the houndâ€™s throat.
her jaws were locked.

i  turned  old  dan  loose  and,  getting
astraddle  of  little ann,  i  pried  her  jaws
apart with my hands. old dan had darted
back  in.  grabbing  his  collar  again,  i
pulled them off to one side.

the  blue  hound  lay  where  he  was.  i
thought perhaps he was already dead, and
then i saw him move a little.

still holding my dogs by their collars, i
looked back. i couldnâ€™t understand what i
saw.  rubin  was  laying  where  he  had
fallen.  his  back  was  toward  me,  and  his
body was bent in a â€œuâ€ shape. rainie was
standing  on  the  other  side  of  him,  staring
down.

i  hollered  and  asked

something  behind  me.  it  was  my  dogs.  i
tried to tell them i wasnâ€™t going hunting. i
just had a little business to attend to, and if
they would go back, iâ€™d take them out that
night.  it  was  no  use.  they  couldnâ€™t
understand.

circling around through the flats, i came
to the hollow above the pritchardsâ€™ place.
down  below  me,
the
graveyard, and the fresh mound of dirt. as
quietly as i could, i started easing myself
down the mountainside.

i  could  see

old dan loosened a rock. the further it
bounced, the louder it got. it slammed up

against a post oak tree and sounded like a
gunshot. i held my breath and watched the
house. no one came out.

just as we reached the mountaintop, my

and  just  to  show  off,  he  sat  down  on  his

as  nervous  as  a  june  bug  in  a  henhouse.
the  day  seemed  endless.  a  few  of  the
miserable hours were spent talking to my
dogs. i told them all about the big hunt and
how important it was.

â€œnow if you donâ€™t win the golden cup,â€
i  said,  â€œi  wonâ€™t  be  mad  because  i  know
you will do your best.â€

old dan wouldnâ€™t even look at me, and
paid  no  attention  to  what  i  said.  he  was
sulking  because  i  hadnâ€™t  been  taking  him
hunting.  when  i  talked  to  little  ann,  it
was different. she listened and seemed to
understand everything i said.

i  dreaded  to  go  to  bed  that  night.  i
thought sleep would be impossible. i must
have been more tired than i thought i was.

looking  to  the  mountains  around  us,  i
saw that the mysterious artist who comes
at  night  had  paid  us  a  visit.  i  wondered
how  he  could  paint  so  many  different
colors in one night; red, wine, yellow, and
rust.

my dogs were trotting along in front of
us. i smiled at the way their hind quarters
shifted to the right. little ann would jump
and bounce and try to get old dan to play,
but the solemn old boy just jogged along,
heedless of everything.

â€œthereâ€™s only one thing wrong with her,

papa,â€ i said.

â€œyea, whatâ€™s that?â€ he asked.
â€œyou  wonâ€™t  believe  it,â€  i  said,  â€œbut

sheâ€™s gun-shy.â€

â€œgun-shy?  how  do  you  know  sheâ€™s

gun-shy?â€ papa asked.

â€œi didnâ€™t know for a long time,â€ i said,
â€œuntil  one  day  when  i  was  hoeing  corn
down  in  the  field  by  the  old  slough.  she
and old dan were digging in a bank after
a  ground  hog.  across  the  river  some
fishermen started shooting a gun. it scared
little  ann,  and  she  came  running  to  me,

shaking all over.â€

â€œaw,â€  papa  said,  â€œmaybe  you  just

thought she was scared.â€

â€œno,  i  didnâ€™t,  papa,â€  i  said.  â€œit
happened  again  up  at  the  store  one  day.
grandpa  shot  a  chicken  hawk.  when  the
gun  went  off,  it  scared  her  half  to  death.
no, sheâ€™s gun-shy all right.â€

â€œaw,  well,â€

pa  growled.  â€œtheyâ€™re
not  going  to  have  mush,  not  if  i  can  help
it.â€

he  walked  over  to  a  grocery  box,
mumbling as he did, â€œmush! a hound canâ€™t
hunt on a bellyful of that stuff.â€

he came back and handed me two large
cans  of  corned-beef  hash,  saying,  â€œhere.
reckon theyâ€™ll eat this.â€

i wanted to hug my old grandpaâ€™s neck.
â€œsure,  grandpa,â€  i  said,  â€œtheyâ€™ll  love
that.â€

opening one of the cans, i dumped it out
on a piece of bark in front of old dan. he
sniffed at it and refused to eat. i laughed,
for i knew why. while i was opening the
other can, grandpa came over.

â€œwhatâ€™s  the  matter,â€  he  asked.  â€œwonâ€™t

he eat it?â€

â€œsure, grandpa,â€ i said, â€œheâ€™ll eat, but

not before little ann gets her share.â€

with  the  second  can  opened,  i  fed  her
on  another  piece  of  bark.  both  of  them
started eating at the same time.

with  an  astonished  look  on  his  face,

grandpa exclaimed, â€œwell, iâ€™ll be darned.

you train them to do that?â€

â€œno,  grandpa,â€

i  said.  â€œtheyâ€™ve
always  been  that  way.  they  wonâ€™t  take
anything  away  from  each  other,  and
everything they do, they do it as one.â€

papa  had  overheard  our  conversation.
he  said,  â€œyou  think  thatâ€™s  strange.  you
should have seen what i saw one day.

â€œone  of  the  girls  threw  two  cold
biscuits out in the back yard to old dan.
he  stood  and  looked  at  them  for  a  bit,
then, picking both of them up in his mouth,
he  trotted  around  the  house.  i  followed
just  to  see  what  he  was  going  to  do.  he
walked  up  in  front  of  the  doghouse,  laid
them down, and growled; not like he was

mad.  it  was  a  strange  kind  of  a  growl.
little ann  came  out  of  the  doghouse  and
each of them ate a biscuit. now, i saw this
with my own eyes. believe me, those dogs
are close to each otherâ€”real close.â€

you going to enter?â€

i  couldnâ€™t  decide.  i  said,  â€œiâ€™ll  think  it

over tonight and let you know tomorrow.â€
the  next  morning  when  i  stepped
outside  the  tent  i  saw  men  everywhere.
they  were  combing  and  brushing  their
dogs,  and  getting  them  pruned  for  the
beauty  contest.  beautiful  combs  and
brushes were used to brush expensive oils
into their glossy hair.

going  over  to  my  dogs,  i  stood  and
looked at them. i started to untie old dan
but,  taking  a  closer  look  at  him,  i  could
see  he  could  never  win  a  beauty  contest.
his  face  and  ears  were  a  mass  of  old
scars,  caused  from  the  many  fights  with
tough  old  coons  and  bobcats.  i  held  his
head  in  my  hands  and  felt  sorry  for  him,
but loved him that much more.

i  looked  little  ann  over  and  couldnâ€™t
see  any  scars.  i  laughed  because  i  knew

why. she was too smart to walk right up in
the  face  of  a  fight.  she  would  wait  u

my  father  and  grandfather  were  gone.
no  doubt  they  were  over  in  some  tent
visiting old friends and making new ones.
looking  around  to  find  something  i
could  use  to  groom  my  dog,  i  saw
grandpaâ€™s  open  suitcase.  there,  right  on
top,  was  the  very  thing  i  needed,  his
beautiful  bone-handled  hairbrush  and  his
ivory  comb.  picking  them  up,  i  turned

not  waiting  for  anything  more,  i
scooted  for  the  door.  crawling  under  the
buggy,  i  lay  down  between  my  dogs.  i
knew  he  wouldnâ€™t  be  mad  at  me,  but  it
would be best to stay away for a while.

all  that  day  i  was  restless.  i  prowled
through  the  camp.  every  little  while  i
would go and see how old dan and little
ann were. once i took two weenies from
our groceries. i heated them and gave them
to  my  dogs

swallowed  his  down  in  one  gulp,  and
looked  at  me  as  if  to  say,  â€œis  that  all?â€
little  ann  ate  hers  in  a  ladylike  way.  i
could  have  sworn  i  saw  a  small  grin  on

in  the  afternoon  our  judge  came  over  and
introduced  himself.  he  told  us  heâ€™d  be
going with us that night.

about  sundown  we  piled  in  our  buggy
and  drove  a  few  miles  downriver.  i
noticed other hunters doing the same thing.
everyone was trying to get away from the
already-hunted territory.

it  was  dark  by  the  time  grandpa
stopped. i untied the ropes from my dogs.
little ann  reared  up  on  me  and  whined.
old dan walked off a few yards, stretched
his  body,  and  dragged  his  claws  through
the soft bottom soil. opening his mouth, he
let  out  one
then

loud  bawl,  and

disappeared in the thick timber. little ann
was right on his heels.

we took off after them.
grandpa  got  nervous.  he  said  to  me,
â€œdonâ€™t  you  think  you  ought  to  whoop  to
them?â€

i told him to wait a little while. there

would be plenty of time for whooping.

he snorted and said he thought a hunter

always whooped to h

â€œi do, grandpa,â€ i said, â€œbut not before

they strike a trail.â€

we walked on. every now and then we
would  stop  and  listen.  i  could  hear  the
loud snuffing of old dan. once we caught
a  glimpse  of  little  ann  as  she  darted
across  an  opening  that  was  bathed  in
moonlight.  she  was  as  silent  as  a  ghost
and as quick as a flitting shadow.

papa  said,  â€œit  sure  is  a  beautiful  night

for hunting.â€

the  judge  said,  â€œyou  canâ€™t  beat  these
ozark mountain nights for beauty. i donâ€™t
care where you go.â€

grandpa  started  to  say  something.  his
voice  was  drowned  out  by  the  bell-like
cry of little ann.

in  a  whisper,  i

ell, why are you laughing?â€ he said.
at  this  remark,  papa  and  the  judge

laughed until their eyes watered.

mumbling  and  grumbling,  grandpa
said, â€œif you fellows were as cold as i am,
you wouldnâ€™t be laughing.â€

we knew we shouldnâ€™t be laughing, but

we couldnâ€™t help ourselves.

the  judge  looked  at  his  watch.  â€œitâ€™s
after  three  oâ€™clock,â€  he  said.  â€œdo  you

think theyâ€™ll tree another one?â€

as  if  to  throw  the  words  back  in  the
judgeâ€™s face, old dan opened up. i stood
up  and  whooped.  â€œwhoo-e-e!  get  him,
dan! get him! put him up a little tree.â€

there  was  a  mad  scramble.  grandpa
tried  to  put  his  britches  on  backwards.
the judge and papa ran over to help him
with  his  shoes.  each  one  tried  to  put  a
shoe on the wrong foot. i was laughing so
hard i could do nothing.

the  fire,  i
realized we had forgotten the coonskins. i
ran back for them.

my  dogs  had  jumped  the  coon  in

 we stood and watched. every now
and  then,  old  dan  would  rear  up  on  a
large  hackberry  tree  that  was  standing
about seven feet from the fence and bawl

as  yet  little  ann  had  not  bawled  the

working  everywhere.  she  climbed  up  on
the  rail  fence  and  followed  its  zigzag
course  until  she  disappeared

the  judge  said,  â€œit  looks  like  he  has

them fooled.â€

â€œmaybe  you  had  better  call  them  off,â€
grandpa said. â€œwe can go someplace else
and hunt. weâ€™ve got to get one more coon,
even if i have to tree it myself.â€

for some reason, no one laughed at his

remark.

sucking in a mouthful of air, i held it. i
could  feel  my  heart  pounding  against  my
ribs. i closed my eyes tight and gritted my
teeth to keep the tears from coming.
â€œletâ€™s go to them,â€ grandpa said.
â€œno, wait a minute,â€ i said.
â€œwhy?â€ he asked.

â€œwait  till  old  dan  gets  there,â€  i  said.
â€œitâ€™s  daylight  now,  and  if  we  walk  up  to
the tree, the coon will jump out. itâ€™s hard
to  keep  a  coon  in  a  tree  after  daylight.
letâ€™s wait until old dan gets there. then
if he jumps, he wonâ€™t have a chance to get
away.â€

â€œthe boyâ€™s right,â€ the judge said. â€œitâ€™s
hard  to  keep  a  coon  in  a  tree  after
daybreak.â€

just  then  we  heard  old  dan.  his  deep
voice  shattered
the  morning  silence.
searching for the lost trail, he had crossed
the fence and worked his way out into an
old  field.  turning  around,  we  saw  him
coming.  he  was  a  red  blur  in  the  gray
morning  shadows.  coming  to  the  rail
fence, and withou

reached  the  dark  shadows,  they  stopped,
turned  around,  and  stared  straight  at  me
for an instant.

the  judge  saw  their  strange  actions.
laying  a  hand  on  my  shoulder,  he  asked,
â€œwhat did they say, son?â€

i  said,  â€œnothing  that  anyone  could
understand,  but  i  can  feel  that  they  know
this hunt is important. they know it just as
well as you or i.â€

it  was  little  ann  who  found  the  trail.
before the echo of her sharp cry had died
away, old danâ€™s deep voice floated out of
the swamp.

â€œwell, letâ€™s go,â€ papa said eagerly.
â€œno, letâ€™s wait a minute,â€ i said.
â€œwait? why?â€ grandpa asked.
â€œto see which way heâ€™s going to run,â€ i

said.

the  coon  broke  out  of  the  swamp  and
headed for the river. listening to my dogs,
i could tell they were close to him. i said

to papa, â€œi donâ€™t think heâ€™ll ever make it
to  the  river.  theyâ€™re  right  on  his  heels
now.â€

by the time we had circled the swamp,

far out on a limb and jumped. he landed
in  an  old  fallen  treetop.  he  scooted
through  it.  coming  out  on  the  other  side,
he  ran  for  the  river.  the  tangled  mass  of
limbs  slowed  my  dogs  and  they  all  but
tore the treetop apart getting out of it. the
coon  was  just  one  step  ahead  of  them  as
they reached the river. we heard them hit
the water.

running  over,  we  stood  and  watched
the  fight.  the  coon  was  at  home  in  the
river. he crawled up on old danâ€™s head,
trying to force him under. before he could
do  it,  little  ann  reached  up  and  pulled
him off.

in  a  scared  voice,  papa  said,  â€œthat

water looks deep to me.â€

â€œmaybe  you  had  better  call  them  off,â€
said the judge. â€œthatâ€™s a big coon and he

could  drown  one  of  them  easily  in  that
deep water.â€

â€œcall  them  off?â€  i  said.  â€œwhy,  you
couldnâ€™t  whip  them  off  with  a  stick.
thereâ€™s  no  use  for  anyone  to  get  scared.

 the judge fell in behind him.

by  this  time  the  ground  was  covered
with  a  thin  white  layer  of  sleet.  we  kept

slipping and falling. i could hear grandpa
mumbling  and  grumbling.  the  wind-
driven sleet stung our skin like thousands
of pricking needles. strong gusts of wind
growled  and  moaned  through  the  tops  of
the tall timber.

once  during  a  momentary  lull  of  the
storm,  i  thought  i  heard  the  baying  of  a
hound.  i  told  my  father  i  thought  i  had
heard old dan.

â€œfrom which direction?â€ he asked.
â€œfrom that way,â€ i said, pointing to our

we  started  on.  a  few  minutes  later

stopped.  he

shouted

â€œno,â€  grandpa  shouted  back.  â€œi  canâ€™t

hear anything in this storm.â€

at that moment, all of us heard the deep

â€œit sounds as if theyâ€™re close,â€ grandpa

â€œletâ€™s split up,â€ said the judge. â€œmaybe

one of us can find them.â€

â€œno,â€  papa  said,  â€œitâ€™d  be  easy  to  get

lost in this storm.â€

â€œi think theyâ€™re more to the right of us,â€

i said.

â€œi do, too,â€ papa said.
we trudged on. old dan bawled again.

the  sound  of  his  voice  seemed  to  be  all
around us.

â€œthe  way  that  wind  is  whipping  the
sound through this timber,â€ the judge said,
â€œweâ€™d be lucky if we ever found them.â€

papa shouted over the roar of the wind,
â€œwe  canâ€™t  take  much  more  of  this.  weâ€™ll
freeze to death.â€

the men were giving up. i felt the knot
again  as  it  crawled  up  in  my  throat.  salt
water  froze  on  my  eyelashes.  kneeling
down, i put my ear close to the icy groun

papa  didnâ€™t  hesitate.  pointing  the  gun
high  over  his  head,  he  pulled  the  trigger.
the sharp crack rang out into the teeth of
the storm.

we waited.
just  when  i  had  given  up  all  hope  and
had  sunk  to  the  lowest  depth  of  despair,
out of the white wall of driving sleet, my
little  dog  came  to  me.  i  knelt  down  and
gathered her in my arms.

taking  one  of  the  lead  ropes  from  my
pocket, i tied it to her collar. i said, â€œfind

him, little girl. please find old dan.â€

right  then  i  didnâ€™t  care  about  coons,
gold cups, or anything. all i wanted was
my dogs.

i  donâ€™t  know  how  she  did  it.  straight
into the face of the storm she led us. time
after  time  she  would  stop  and  turn  her
head  this  way  and  that.  i  knew  she
couldnâ€™t  scent  or  see  anything.  instinct
alone  was  guiding  her.  over  a  winding
and twisting trail, we followed.

coming  out  of  the  bottoms,  she  led  us
into  a  thick  canebrake.  the  tall  stalks

fight a coon?â€

â€œsure,  just  run  him  out  of  that  tree,â€  i

at the crack of the gun, the coon ran far
out on a big limb and stopped. again the
hunter sprinkled him with bird shot. this
time  he  jumped.  hitting  the  ground,  he
crouched down.

old  dan  made  a  lunge.  just  as  he
reached  him,  the  coon  sprang  straight  up
and  came  down  on  his  head.  holding  on
with his claws, the coon sank his teeth in a
long tender ear. old dan was furious. he
started  turning  in  a  circle,  bawling  with
pain.

little ann was trying hard to get ahold
of  the  coon  but  she  couldnâ€™t.  because  of
his  fast  circling,  old  danâ€™s  feet  flew  out
from  under  him  and  he  fell.  this  gave
little ann a chance. darting in, her jaws
closed  on  the  back  of  the  coonâ€™s  neck.  i
knew the fight was over.

arriving back at camp, i saw that all the
tents  had  been  taken  down  but  ours.  a
hunter  said,  â€œeveryone  was  i

about it. the doctor said it wasnâ€™t as bad

grandpa would be home in a few days.â€

i  was  happy  to  hear  this  news,  and
could  tell  by  the  pleased  look  on  my
fatherâ€™s face, he was glad to hear it, too.

on entering the house, papa said, â€œoh, i
almost  forgot.â€  he  handed  the  box  of
money to mama.

â€œwhatâ€™s this?â€ she asked.
â€œoh, itâ€™s just a little gift from old dan

and little ann,â€ papa said.

mama opened the box. i saw the color
drain  from  her  face.  her  hands  started

trembling.  turning  her  back  to  us,  she
walked  over  and  set  it  on  the  mantel. a
peaceful  silence  settled  over  the  room.  i
could  hear  the  clock  ticking  away.  the
fire in the fireplace crackled and popped.
turning from the mantel, mama looked
straight  at  us.  her  lips  were  tightly

silence closed in.

i stared back at the unblinking eyes.
i  could  make  out  the  bulk  of  a  large
animal, crouched on a huge branch, close
to the trunk of the big tree. then it moved.
i  heard  the  scratch  of  razor-sharp  claws
on the bark. it stood up and moved out of
the  shadows  on  to  the  limb.  i  saw  it
clearly as it passed between the moon and
me. i knew what it was. it was the devil
cat of the ozarks, the mountain lion.

the silence was shattered by one long,
loud bawl from old dan. iâ€™d never heard
my  dog  bawl  like  that.  it  was  different.
his  voice  rang  out  over  the  mountains,
loud and clear. the vibration of the deep
tones  rolled  in  the  silence  of  the  frosty
night, on and on, out over the flats, down
in  the  canyons,  and  died  away  in  the
rimrocks,  like  the  cry  of  a  lost  soul.  old

dan had voiced his challenge to the devil
cat.

there  was  a  low  cough  and  a  deep
growl  from  the  lion.  i  saw  him  crouch.  i

old dan didnâ€™t wait. rearing up on his
hind  legs,  he  met  the  lion  in  the  air.  the
heavy weight bowled him over and over.
he wound up in a fallen treetop.

the impact of the two bodies threw the
lion off balance. little ann darted in. her
aim was true. i heard the snap of her steel-
trap jaws as they closed on his throat.

with a squall of pain and rage, the big
cat rolled over on his side, dragging little

inward. with a cry of pain, she loosened
her  hold.  i  saw  the  blood  squirting  from
the  deep  wound  in  her  shoulder.  she
ignored it and bored back into the fight.

old dan, stunned for an instant from the
impact of the lionâ€™s body, fought his way
from  the  treetop.  bawling  the  cry  of  the
damned, he charged back in.

i  went  berserk,  and  charged  into  the

fight.

there in the flinty hills of the ozarks, i
fought  for  the  lives  of  my  dogs.  i  fought
with  the  only  weapon  i  had,  the  sharp
cutting blade of a double-bitted ax.

blood showed red on the bit of the ax, but
as  yet  i  had  not  gotten  in  the  fatal  lick.  i
knew it had to be soon for my dogs were
no  match  against  the  razor-sharp  claws
and the long, yellow fangs.

the screams of the big cat and the deep
bellowing  voices  of  my  dogs  echoed
through the mountains as if the demons of
hell had been turned loose. down the side
of the mountain, the terrible fight went on,

down to the very bottom of the canyon.

the big cat had old dan by the throat. i
knew  he  was  seeking  to  cut  the  all-
important  vein,  the  jugular. at  the  pitiful
bawl  of  old  dan,  little  ann,  throwing
caution  to  the  wind,  ran  in  and  sank  her
teeth in the lionâ€™s tough neck.

with  her  claws  digging

the
mountain  soil,  she  braced  herself,  and
started  pulling.  the  muscles  in  her  small
legs knotted and quivered. she was trying
hard to pull the devil catâ€™s fangs from the
throat of old dan.

red body sailed in between the outspread

throat.

i  got  to  my  feet  and  went  over  to  my
dogs. i knew i had to inspect them to see
how  badly  they  were  hurt.  it  wasnâ€™t  too
hard to get little ann to loosen her hold. i

places,  but  nothing  fatal.  the  only  bad
wound she had was in her shoulder. it was

it was different with old dan. try as i
might,  he  wouldnâ€™t  turn  loose.  maybe  he
could remember the night in the cave when
he  was  a  pup.  how  the  big  cat  had
screamed and how he had bawled back at
him.

i took hold of his hind legs and tried to
pull  him  loose.  it  was  no  use.  he  knew
that the hold he had was a deadly one and
he wasnâ€™t going to let go. i tried to tell him
it was all over, that the lion was dead, to
turn loose as i wanted to see how badly he
was  hurt.  he  couldnâ€™t  understand  and

i nodded my head.
â€œhow bad is it?â€ she asked.

â€œthe way your dogs are cut up,â€ papa

said, â€œit must have been a terrible fight.â€

they all started crying.
â€œnow  here,â€  mama  said,  going  over,
â€œyou  girls  get  back  in  bed. youâ€™ll  take  a
death  of  cold  being  up  like  this  in  your
bare feet.â€

â€œmommie,â€  the  little  one  said.  â€œgod

wonâ€™t let old dan die, will he?â€

â€œi  donâ€™t  think  so,  honey,â€  mama  said.

â€œnow off to bed.â€

their room.

they turned and walked slowly back to

â€œit  was,  papa,â€  i  said.  â€œi  never  saw
anything like it. little ann wouldnâ€™t have
fought  the  lion  if  it  hadnâ€™t  been  for  old
dan. all she was doing was helping him.
he  wouldnâ€™t  quit.  he  just  stayed  right  in
there  till  the  end.  i  even  had  to  pry  his
jaws loose from the lionâ€™s throat after the
lion was dead.â€

glancing at old dan, papa said, â€œitâ€™s in
his  blood,  billy.  heâ€™s  a  hunting  hound,
and the best one i ever saw. he only has
two lovesâ€”you and hunting. thatâ€™s all he
knows.â€

i told them how the lion had leaped at
me and how my dogs had gotten between

â€œif  it  hadnâ€™t  been  for  them,  papa,â€  i
said, â€œi probably wouldnâ€™t be here now.â€

wouldnâ€™t be here now?â€

â€œthey  were  so  close  together,â€  i  said,
â€œwhen  they  came

  up  off  the  ground  they
looked just like one.â€

there was a moaning sigh from mama.
she covered her face with her hands and
started crying.

â€œi  donâ€™t  know,â€  she  sobbed,  â€œi  just
donâ€™t know. to think how close you came
to  being  killed.  i  donâ€™t  think  i  can  stand
any more.â€

â€œnow, now,â€ papa said, as he walked
over and put his arms around her. â€œdonâ€™t
go  all  to  pieces.  itâ€™s  all  over.  letâ€™s  be
thankful and do our best for old dan.â€

â€œdo you think heâ€™ll die, papa?â€ i asked.
â€œi  donâ€™t  know,  billy,â€  papa  said,
shaking his head. â€œheâ€™s lost an awful lot
of blood and heâ€™s a mighty sick dog. all

our  wait  wasnâ€™t

long.  my  dogâ€™s
breathing grew faster and faster, and there
was a terrible rattling in his throat. i knelt
down and laid his head in my lap.

old  dan  must  have  known  he  was
dying.  just  before  he  drew  one  last  sigh,
and a feeble thump of his tail, his friendly
gray eyes clos

nâ€™t  die,  dan,â€  i  said.  â€œdonâ€™t  leave  me
now.â€

we can do now is wait and see.â€

i  looked  to  mama  for  help.  her  face
was  as  white  as  the  bark  on  a  sycamore
tree  and  the  hurt  in  her  eyes  tore  at  my
heart.  she  opened  her  mouth  to  say
something but words wouldnâ€™t come out.

feeling as cold as an arctic wind, i got

up  and  stumbled  to  a  chair.  mama  came
over and said something. her words were
only a murmur in my ears.

very gently papa picked old dan up in
his arms and carried him out on the porch.
when he came back in the house, he said,
â€œwell, we did all we could do, but i guess
it wasnâ€™t enough.â€

at that moment. i knew she was all right.

i  had  never  seen  my  father  and  mother
look so tired and weary as they did on that
night. i knew they wanted to comfort me,
but didnâ€™t know what to say.

papa tried. â€œbilly,â€ he said, â€œi wouldnâ€™t
think  too  much  about  this  if  i  were  you.
itâ€™s not good to hurt like that. i

i wasnâ€™t even thinking about little ann

â€œiâ€™m  thankful  that  i  still  have  her,â€  i
said, â€œbut how can i forget old dan? he
gave his life for me, thatâ€™s what he didâ€”
just laid down his life for me. how can i
ever forget something like that?â€

mama  said,  â€œitâ€™s  been  a  terrible  night
for all of us. letâ€™s go to bed and try to get
some  rest.  maybe  weâ€™ll  all  feel  better
tomorrow.â€

â€œno, mama,â€ i said. â€œyou and papa go
on to bed. i think iâ€™ll stay up for a while. i
couldnâ€™t sleep anyway.â€

mama started to protest, but papa shook
his head. arm in arm they walked from the
room.

n  i  heard  a  noise  out  on
the  porch.  i  got  up,  walked  over  to  the
door,  and  listened.  it  came  again,  a  low
whimper and a scratchy sound.

i could think of only one thing that could
have made the noise. it had to be my dog.
he wasnâ€™t dead. he had come back to life.
with a pounding heart, i opened the door
and stepped out on the porch.

what  i  saw  was  more  than  i  could
stand.  the  noise  i  had  heard  had  been
made  by  little ann. all  her  life  she  had
slept by old danâ€™s side. and although he
was dead, she had left the doghouse, had
come  back  to  the  porch,  and  snuggled  up

close to his side.

she looked up at me and whimpered. i
couldnâ€™t  stand  it.  i  didnâ€™t  know  i  was
running until i tripped and fell. i got to my
feet and ran on and on, down through our
fields  of  shocked  corn,  until  i  fell  face
down  on  the  riverâ€™s  bank.  there  in  the
gray shadows of a breaking dawn, i cried
until i could cry no more.

 the  hillside,  at  the  foot  of  a
beautiful  red  oak  tree,  i  dug  his  grave.
there  where  the  wild  mountain  flowers
would grow in the spring, i laid him away.
i  had  a  purpose  in  burying  my  dog  up
there  on  the  hillside.  it  was  a  beautiful

spot. from there one could see the country
for  miles,  the  long  white  crooked  line  of
the  river,  the  tall  thick  timber  of  the
bottoms,  the  sycamore,  birch,  and  box
elder. i thought perhaps that on moonlight
nights old dan would be able to hear the
deep  voices  of  the  hounds  as  they  rolled
out of the river bottoms on the frosty air.

after the last shovel of dirt was patted
in place, i sat down and let my mind drift
back through the years. i thought of the old
k.  c.  baking  powder  can,  and  the  first
time i saw my pups in the box at the depot.
i  thought  of  the  fifty  dollars,  the  nickels
and  dimes,  and
fishermen  and
blackberry patches.

i looked at his grave and, with tears in
my eyes, i

he had seen her go
up the hollow from the house, so weak she

could  hardly  stand.  mama  had  watched
her  until  she  had  disappeared  in  the
timber.

i  hurried  up  the  hollow,  calling  her
name. i called and called. i went up to the
head  of  it,  still  calling  her  name  and
praying she would come to me. i climbed
out onto the flats; looking, searching, and
calling. it was no use. my dog was gone.

i  had  a  thought,  a  ray  of  hope.  i  just
knew iâ€™d find her at the grave of old dan.
i hurried there.

i  found  her  lying  on  her  stomach,  her
hind  legs  stretched  out  straight,  and  her
front feet folded back under her chest. she
had laid her head on his grave. i saw the
trail  where  she  had  dragged  herself
through the leaves. the way she lay there,
i thought she was alive. i called her name.

she  made  no  movement.  with  the  last
ounce  of  strength  in  her  body,  she  had
dragged herself to the grave of old dan.

kneeling  down  by  her  side,  i  reache

 started  lifting  out  bundles
of money.

after  stacking  them  in  a  neat  pile,  he
raised his head and looked straight at me.
â€œbilly,â€  he  said,  â€œyou  know  how  your
mother  has  prayed  that  some  day  weâ€™d
have  enough  money  to  move  out  of  these
hills  and  into  town  so  that  you  children
could get an education.â€

i nodded my head.
â€œwell,â€  he  said,  in  a  low  voice,
â€œbecause  of  your  dogs,  her  prayers  have
been answered. this is the money earned
by old dan and little ann. iâ€™ve managed
to make the farm feed us and clothe us and
iâ€™ve saved every cent your furs brought in.
we now have enough.â€

â€œisnâ€™t  it  wonderful,â€  mama  said.  â€œitâ€™s

just like a miracle.â€

â€œi  think  it  is  a  miracle,â€  papa  said.
â€œremember, billy said a prayer when he
asked  for  his  pups  and  then  there  were
your prayers. billy got his pups. through
those  dogs  your  prayers  were  answered.
yes, iâ€™m sure it is a miracle.â€
