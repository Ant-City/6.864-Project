  eli. yes my good lord, ile follow presently.
follow i must, i cannot go before,
while gloster beares this base and humble minde.

dame elianor giues gold, to bring the witch:
gold cannot come amisse, were she a deuill.
yet haue i gold flyes from another coast:
i dare not say, from the rich cardinall,
and from the great and new-made duke of suffolke;
yet i doe finde it so: for to be plaine,
they (knowing dame elianors aspiring humor)
haue hyred me to vnder-mine the duchesse,
and buzze these coniurations in her brayne.
