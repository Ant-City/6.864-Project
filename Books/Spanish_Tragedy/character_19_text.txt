[prologue]

                enter the ghost of andrea, and with him revenge.

  ghost.  when this eternal substance of my soul
    did live imprison'd in my wanton flesh,
    each in their function serving others' need,
    i was a courtier in the spanish court:
    my name was don andrea; my descent,
    though not ignoble, yet inferior far
    to gracious fortunes of

 strike him sure,
    for die he must, if we do mean to live.

  ped.  but how shall serberine be there, my lord?

  lor.  let me alone, i'll send him to meet
    the prince and me where thou must do this deed.

  ped.  it shall be done, my lord; it shall be done;
    and i'll go arm myself to meet him there.

  lor.  when things shall alter, as i hope they will,
    then shalt thou mount for this, thou knowest my mind.

                exit pedringano.

    che le ieron!

                enter page.

  page.         my lord.

  lor.                  go, sirrah,
    to serberine, and bid him forthwith meet
    the prince and me at s. luigi's park,
    behind the house, this evening, boy.

  page.                         i go, my lord.

  lor.  but, sirrah, let the hour be eight o'clock.
    bid him not fail.

  page.         i fly, my lord.

                exit.

  lor.  now to confirm the complot thou hast cast
    of all these practices, i'll spread the watch,
    upon precise commandme

and.

                enter the watch.

  i watch.  i wonder much to what intent it is
    that we are thus expressly charg'd to watch.

  ii watch.  this by commandment in the king's own
    name.

  iii watch.  but we were never wont to watch and ward
    so near the duke his brother's house before.

  ii watch.  content yourself, stand close, there's somewhat
    in't.

                enter serberine.

  ser. [aside]  here, serberine, attend and stay thy pace;
    for here did don lorenzo's page appoint
    that thou by his command shouldst meet with him.
    how fit a place, if one were so dispos'd,
    methinks this corner is to close with one.

  ped. [aside]  here comes the bird that i must seize upon;
    now, pedringano, or never play the man!

  ser.  [aside]  i wonder that his lordship stays so long,
    or wherefore should he send for me so late.

  ped.  for this, serberine; and thou shalt ha't!

                shoots.

    so, there he lies; my promise is perform'd.

, my lord, but both in one;
    but i suspect--and the presumptions great--
    that by those base confed'rates in our fault
    touching the death of don horatio
    we are all betray'd to old hieronimo.

  bal.  betray'd, lorenzo? tush!  it cannot be.

  lor.  a guilty conscience urged with the thought
    of former evils, easily cannot err:
    i am persuaded--and dissuade me not--
    that all's revealed to hieronimo.
    and therefore know that i have cast it thus--

                [enter page.]

    but here's the page.  how now?  what news with thee?

  page.  my lord, serberine is slain.

  bal.  who?  serberine, my man?

  page. your highness' man, my lord.

  lor.  speak, page: who murder'd him?

  page.  he that is apprehended for the fact.

  lor.  who?

  page.         pedringano.

  bal.  is serberine slain, that lov'd his lord so well?
    injurious villain!  murd'rer of his friend!

  lor.  hath pedringano murder'd serberine?
    my lord, let me entreat you to take the pai

    i set the trap, he breaks the worthless twigs,
    and sees not that wherewith the bird was lim'd.
    thus hopeful men, that means to hold their own,
    must look, like fowlers, to their dearest friends.
    he runs to kill whom i have holp to catch,
    and no man knows it was my reaching fetch.
    'tis hard to trust unto a multitude,--
    or any one, in mine opinion,
    when men themselves their secrets will reveal.

                enter a messenger with a letter.

  lor.  boy.

  page.         my lord.

  lor.                  what's he?

  mes.  i have a letter to your lordship.

  lor.                          from whence?

  mes.  from pedringano that's imprison'd.

  lor.  so he is in prison then?

  mes.                  aye, my good lord.

  lor.  what would he with us?

                [reads the letter.]

                                he writes us here
    to stand good lord and help him in distress.
    tell him i have his letters, know his mind;

    bid him not doubt of his delivery.
    tell him his pardon is already sign'd,
    and thereon bid him boldly be resolv'd;
    for, were he ready to be turned off,--
    as 'tis my will the uttermost be tried,--
    thou with his pardon shalt attend him still.
    show him this box, tell him his pardon's in't;
    but open't not, and if thou lov'st thy life,
    but let him wisely keep his hopes unknown.

    away!

  page.  i go, my lord, i run!

  lor.   but, sirrah, see that this be cleanly done.

    now stands our fortune on a tickle point,
    and now or never ends lorenzo's doubts.
    one only thing is uneffected yet,
    and that's to see the executioner,--

    that lie too open to advantages.

 o andrea, that thou sawest
    me for thy friend horatio handled thus,
    and him for me thus causeless murdered!
    well, force perforce, i must constrain myself
    to patience, and apply me to the time,
    till heav'n, as i have hop'd, shall set me free.

  lor.  boy, talk no further; thus far things go well.
    thou art assur'd that thou sawest him dead?

  page.  or else, my lord, i live not.

  lor.                  that's enough.
    as for this resolution at his end,
    leave that to him with whom he sojourns now.
    here, take my ring, and give it christophel,
    and bid him let my sister be enlarg'd,
    and bring her hither straight.
