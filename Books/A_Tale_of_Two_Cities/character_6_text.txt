“so-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “yo there! stand!
i shall fire!”

the pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,
a man’s voice called from the mist, “is that the dover mail?”

“never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “what are you?”

“_is_ that the dover mail?”

“why do you want to know?”

“i want a passenger, if it is.”

“what passenger?”

“mr. jarvis lorry.”

our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. the guard,
the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.

“keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist,
“because, if i should make a mistake, it could never be set right in
your lifetime. gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight.”

“what is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering
speech. “who wants me? is it jerry?”

second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.

completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,
mr. lorry dropped off to sleep. the arrival of his breakfast roused him,
and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:

“i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
time to-day. she may ask for mr. jarvis lorry, or she may only ask for a
gentleman from tellson’s bank. please to let me know.”

“yes, sir. tellson’s bank in london, sir?”

“yes.”

“yes, sir. we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris, sir. a
vast deal of travelling, sir, in tellson and company’s house.”

“yes. we are quite a french house, as well as an english one.”

mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many
shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. i should be so
much more at my ease about your state of mind.”

without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had
very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she
communicated some reassurance to mr. jarvis lorry.

“that’s right, that’s right. courage! business! you have business before
you; useful business. miss manette, your mother took this course with
you. and when she died--i believe broken-hearted--having never slackened
her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,
to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud
upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his
heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering

“i hope she will do well now,” said mr. lorry.

“no thanks to you in brown, if she does. my darling pretty!”

“i hope,” said mr. lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility, “that you accompany miss manette to france?”

“a likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. “if it was ever
intended that i should go across salt water, do you suppose providence
would have cast my lot in an island?”

this being another question hard to answer, mr. jarvis lorry withdrew to
consider it.




v. the wine-shop


a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. the
accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled
out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just
outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.

all the people within reach had suspended their business, or their
idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. the rough, irregular

ced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.

“willingly, sir,” said monsieur defarge, and quietly stepped with him to
the door.

their conference was very short, but very decided. almost at the first
word, monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive. it had
not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. the gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. madame defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.

mr. jarvis lorry and miss manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,
joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
company just before. it opened from a stinking little black courtyard,
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited
by a great number of people. in the gloomy tile-paved entry to the
gloomy tile-paved staircase, monsieur defarge bent down on one knee
to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. it was
a gentle action, but

flinging other refuse from its own windows. the uncontrollable and
hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted
the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost
insupportable. through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt
and poison, the way lay. yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to
his young companion’s agitation, which became greater every instant, mr.
jarvis lorry twice stopped to rest. each of these stoppages was made
at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left
uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
to crawl in. through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were
caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer
or lower than the summits of the two great towers of notre-dame, had any
promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.

beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from
this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
all through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
whispered in the ears of mr. jarvis lorry--sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:

“i hope you care to be recalled to life?”

and the old answer:

the blue-flies buzzed again, and mr. attorney-general called mr. jarvis
lorry.

“mr. jarvis lorry, are you a clerk in tellson’s bank?”

“i am.”

“on a certain friday night in november one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between london and

doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and
its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.
his scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and
he earned as much as he wanted.

these things were within mr. jarvis lorry’s knowledge, thoughts, and
notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,
on the fine sunday afternoon.

“doctor manette at home?”

expected home.

“miss lucie at home?”

expected home.

“miss pross at home?”

possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
anticipate intentions of miss pross, as to admission or denial of the
fact.

which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?

it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the
answer being obvious. if the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, jarvis lorry, there?
how came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in doctor
manette’s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
doctor’s bedroom door in the early morning?

within a few minutes, miss pross stood whispering at his side. if he
had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have
resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.

felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. for the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which
could break the prison door of his daughter’s husband, and deliver him.
“it all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.
as my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, i will be
helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid
of heaven i will do it!” thus, doctor manette. and when jarvis lorry saw
the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a
clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.

greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with, would
have yielded before his persevering purpose. while he kept himself
