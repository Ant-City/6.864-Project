guy francon ended with a flourish, raising his right arm in a sweeping salute; informal, but 
with an air, that gay, swaggering air which guy francon could always permit himself. the 
huge hall before him came to life in applause and approval.

a sea of faces, young, perspiring and eager, had been raised solemnly--for forty-five minutes--

to the platform where guy francon had held forth as the speaker at the commencement 
exercises of the stanton institute of technology, guy francon who had brought his o

u.s.a.; guy francon, knight of the legion of honor of france, decorated by the governments

had designed the famous frink national bank building of new york city, on the top of which, 
twenty-five floors above the pavements, there burned in a miniature replica of the hadrian 
mausoleum a wind-blown torch made of glass and the best general electric bulbs.

guy francon descended from the platform, fully conscious of his timing

ht little eyes twinkling wittily. his clothes displayed an artist's infinite attention to details. he 
wished, as he descended the steps, that this were a co-educational school.

the hall before him, he thought, was a splendid specimen of architecture, made a bit stuffy 
today by the crowd and by the neglected problem of ventilation. but it boasted green marble 
dadoes, corinthian columns of cast iron painted gold, and garlands of gilded fruit on the walls; 
the pineapples particularly, thought guy francon, had stood the test of years very well. it is, 
thought guy francon, touching; it was i who built this annex and this very hall, twenty years 
ago; and here i am.

the hall was packed with bodies and faces, so tightly that one could not distinguish at a 
glance which faces belonged to which bodies. it was like a soft, shivering aspic made of 
mixed arms, shoulders, chests and stomachs. one of the heads, pale, dark haired and 
beautiful, belonged to peter keating.

he sat, well in front, trying

he had heard the story of the peabody post office many times. it was the only structure 
anyone had ever known professor peterkin to have erected, before he sacrificed his practice 
to the responsibilities of teaching. a great deal was said about keating's final project--a palace 
of fine arts. for the life of him, keating could not remember at the moment what that project 
was.

through all this, his eyes held the vision of guy francon shaking his hand, and his ears held 
the sounds of francon's mellow voice: "...as i have told you, it is still open, my boy. of course, 
now that you have this scholarship...you will have to decide...a beaux-arts diploma is very 
important to a young man...but i should be delighted to have you in our office...."

the banquet of the class of '22 was long and solemn. keating listened to the speeches with 
interest; when he heard the endless sentences about "young men as the hope of american

roark turned over on his side, looked at him, and laughed. it was a young, kind, friendly 
laughter, a thing so rare to hear from roark that keating felt as if someone had taken his hand
in reassurance; and he forgot that he had a party in boston waiting for him.

"come on," said roark, "you're not being afraid of me, are you? what do you want to ask 
about?"

"it's about my scholarship. the paris prize i got."

"yes?"

"it's for four years. but, on the other hand, guy francon offered me a job with him some time 
ago. today he said it's still open. and i don't know which to take."

roark looked at him; roark's fingers moved in slow rotation, beating against the steps.

"if you want my advice, peter," he said at last, "you've made a mistake already. by asking me. 
by asking anyone. never ask people. not about your work. don't you know what you want? 
how can you stand it, not to know?"

"you see, that's what i admire about you, howard. you always know."

but keating could never be the same when he had an audience, any audience. something 
was gone. he did not know it, but he felt that roark knew; roark's eyes made him 
uncomfortable and that made him angry.

"i want to practice architecture," snapped keating, "not talk about it! gives you a great 
prestige--the old école. puts you above the rank and file of the ex-plumbers who think they 
can build. on the other hand, an opening with francon--guy francon himself offering it!"

roark turned away.

"how many boys will match that?" keating went on blindly. "a year from now they'll be 
boasting they're working for smith or jones if they find work at all. while i'll be with francon & 
heyer!"

"you're quite right, peter," said mrs. keating, rising. "on a question like that you don't want to 
consult your mother. it's too important. i'll leave you to settle it with mr. roark."

 thumb over his shoulder, at a glass door behind them. "him."

"what?" asked keating, turning.

"him," said the boy. "stengel. he does all these things."

behind the glass door keating saw a pair of bony shoulders above the edge of a desk, a 
small, triangular head bent intently, and two blank pools of light in the round frames of 
glasses.

it was late in the afternoon when a presence seemed to have passed beyond the closed door, 
and keating learned from the rustle of whispers around him that guy francon had arrived and 
had risen to his office on the floor above. half an hour later the glass door opened and 
stengel came out, a huge piece of cardboard dangling between his fingers.

"hey, you," he said, his glasses stopping on keating's face. "you doing the plans for this?" he 
swung the cardboard forward. "take this up to the boss for the okay. try to listen to what he'll 

say and try to look intelligent. neither of which matters anyway."

he was short and his arms seemed to hang down to his

s of his ten fingers, up the crimson-plushed stairway to guy 
francon's office. the cardboard displayed a water-color perspective of a gray granite mansion 
with three tiers of dormers, five balconies, four bays, twelve columns, one flagpole and two 
lions at the entrance. in the corner, neatly printed by hand, stood: "residence of mr. and mrs. 
james s. whattles. francon & heyer, architects." keating whistled softly: james s. whattles 
was the multimillionaire manufacturer of shaving lotions.

guy francon's office was polished. no, thought keating, not polished, but shellacked; no, not 
shellacked, but liquid with mirrors melted and poured over every object. he saw splinters of 
his own reflection let loose like a swarm of butterflies, following him across the room, on the 
chippendale cabinets, on the jacobean chairs, on the louis xv mantelpiece. he had time to 
note a genuine roman statue in a corner, sepia photographs of the parthenon, of rheims 
cathedral, of versailles and of the frink nati

he saw his own legs approaching him in the side of the massive mahogany desk. guy 
francon sat behind the desk. guy francon's face was yellow and his cheeks sagged. he 
looked at keating for an instant as if he had never seen him before, then remembered and 
smiled expansively.

"well, well, well, kittredge, my boy, here we are, all set and at home! so glad to see you. sit 
down, boy, sit down, what have you got there? well, there's no hurry, no hurry at all. sit down.

helplessness. "i thoug

"i'll do my best, sir."

"of course you will. what's this they sent me?" francon extended his hand to the drawing, but

but squeezed out of a pastry tube. it was, however, built of white marble. no one knew that 
but the owners who had paid for it. it was now of a streaked, blotched, leprous color, neither 
brown nor green but the worst tones of both, the color of slow rot, the color of smoke, gas 
fumes and acids eating into a delicate stone intended for clean air and open country. the 
frink national bank building, however, was a great success. it had been so great a success 
that it was the last structure guy francon ever designed; its prestige spared him the bother 
from then on.

three blocks east of the frink national bank stood the dana building. it was some stories 
lower and without any prestige whatever. its lines were hard and simple, revealing, 
emphasizing the harmony of the steel skeleton within, as a body reveals the perfection of its 
bones. it had no other ornament to offer. it displayed nothing but the precision of its sharp 
angles, the modeling of its planes, the long streaks of its windows

roark obeyed. cameron stared at him, his thick fingers drumming against the pile of 
drawings.

"so you think they're good?' said cameron. "well, they're awful. it's unspeakable. it's a crime. 
look," he shoved a drawing at roark's face, "look at that. what in christ's name was your 
idea? what possessed you to indent that plan here? did you just want to make it pretty, 
because you had to patch something together? who do you think you are? guy francon, god

lyre, a hammer, a screw driver and a rising sun; it had a circulation of thirty thousand and a

attention of the discriminating to the new melton building by francon & heyer. it stands in 
white serenity as an eloquent witness to the triumph of classical purity and common sense. 
the discipline of an immortal tradition has served here as a cohesive factor in evolving a 
structure whose beauty can reach, simply and lucidly, the heart of every man in the street. 
there is no freak exhibitionism here, no perverted striving for novelty, no orgy of unbridled 
egotism. guy francon, its designer, has known how to subordinate himself to the mandatory 
canons which generations of craftsmen behind him have proved inviolate, and at the same 
time how to display his own creative originality, not in spite of, but precisely because of the 
classical dogma he has accepted with the humility of a true artist. it may be worth mentioning, 
in passing, that dogmatic discipline is the only thing which makes true originality possible....

these words from another man on a printed page to be read by other eyes.

keating sat easily in a comfortable chair. his month with the firm had been well spent. he had 
said nothing and done nothing, but the impression had spread through the office that guy 
francon liked to see this particular boy sent to him whenever anyone had to be sent. hardly a 
day passed without the pleasant interlude of sitting across the desk from guy francon, in a 
respectful, growing intimacy, listening to francon's sighs about the necessity of being 
surrounded by men who understood him.

keating had learned all he could team about guy francon, from his fellow draftsmen. he had 
teamed that guy francon ate moderately and exquisitely, and prided himself on the title of 
gourmet; that he had graduated with distinction from the école des beaux-arts; that he had 
married a great deal of money and that the marriage had not been a happy one; that he

cameron's eyes dropped; then his head moved down a little, then a little farther; his head 
went on dropping slowly, in long, single jerks, then stopped; he sat still, his shoulders

he sat on the floor, his head resting against the edge of a couch, his bare feet stretched out, a 
pair of guy francon's chartreuse pyjamas floating loosely about his limbs.

through the open door of the bathroom he saw francon standing at the washstand, his 
stomach pressed to its shining edge, brushing his teeth.

"that's splendid," said francon, munching through a thick foam of toothpaste. "that'll do just

"no."

they are so terribly good."

"why, thank you, mrs. dunlop."

"what's the matter?"

"nothing. nothing really."

before keating could answer, stengel threw his head back suddenly.

then he leaned forward, his mouth drawn thin in contempt:

"okay. i'll go to that lunch."

when stengel left the firm of francon & heyer to open his own office and proceed with the 
construction of the dunlop house, his first commission, guy francon smashed a ruler against 
the edge of his desk and roared to keating:

"but what beats me is how did that little skunk ever hear of it? to snatch it right from under

hance to shape it. he knew that the 
shape would be changed, torn, distorted. still, some order and reason would remain in its 
plan. it would be a better building than it would have been if he refused.

sometimes, looking at the sketch of a structure simpler, cleaner, more honest than the others, 
roark would say: "that's not so bad, peter. you're improving." and keating would feel an odd 
little jolt inside, something quiet, private and precious, such as he never felt from the 
compliments of guy francon, of his clients, of all others. then he would forget it and feel 
much more substantially pleased when a wealthy lady murmured over a teacup: "you're the 
coming architect of america, mr. keating," though she had never seen his buildings.

he found compensations for his submission to roark. he would enter the drafting room in the 
morning, throw a tracing boy's assignment down on roark's table and say: "howard, do this

john erik snyte was fifty years old; he wore an expression of quizzical amusement, shrewd 
and unwholesome, as if he shared with each man he contemplated a lewd secret which he 
would not mention because it was so obvious to them both. he was a prominent architect; his 
expression did not change when he spoke of this fact. he considered guy francon an 
impractical idealist; he was not restrained by an classic dogma; he was much more skillful 
and liberal: he built anything. he had no distaste for modern architecture and built cheerfully, 
when a rare client asked for it, bare boxes with flat roofs, which he called progressive; he built 
roman mansions which he called fastidious; he built gothic churches which he called 
spiritual. he saw no difference among any of them. he never became angry, except when 
somebody called him eclectic.

the strike of the building-trades unions infuriated guy francon. the strike had started against 
the contractors who were erecting the noyes-belmont hotel, and had spread to all the new 
structures of the city. it had been mentioned in the press that the architects of the noyes-
belmont were the firm of francon & heyer.

most of the press helped the fight along, urging the contractors not to surrender. the loudest 
attacks against the strikers came from the powerful papers of the great wynand chain.

"we have always stood," said the wynand editorials, "for

against the yellow sharks of privilege, but we cannot give our support to the destruction of law 
and order." it had never been discovered whether the wynand papers led the public or the 
public led the wynand papers; it was known only that the two kept remarkably in step. it was 
not known to anyone, however, save to guy francon and a very few others, that gail wynand 
owned the corporation which owned the corporation which owned the noyes-belmont hotel.

this added greatly to francon's discomfort. gail wynand's real-estate operations were 
rumored to be vaster than his journalistic empire. it was the first chance francon had ever had 
at a wynand commission and he grasped it avidly, thinking of the possibilities which it could 
open. he and keating had put their best efforts into designing the most ornate of all rococ

city, and keating found himself spending days and nights at work, with new commissions 
pouring into the office. francon smiled happily at everybody and gave a small party for his 
staff, to erase the memory of anything he might have said. the palatial residence of mr. and 
mrs. dale ainsworth on riverside drive, a pet project of keating's, done in late renaissance 
and gray granite, was complete at last. mr. and mrs. dale ainsworth gave a formal reception 
as a housewarming, to which guy francon and peter keating were invited, but lucius n. 
heyer was ignored, quite accidentally, as always happened to him of late. francon enjoyed 
the reception, because every square foot of granite in the house reminded him of the 
stupendous payment received by a certain granite quarry in connecticut. keating enjoyed the 
reception, because the stately mrs. ainsworth said to him with a disarming smile: "but i was 
certain that you were mr. francon's partner! it's francon and heyer, of course! how perf

"that's what drives clients away," said john erik snyte. "they see a house like that and they 
think all architects are crazy."

"i see no cause for indignation," said gordon l. prescott. "i think it's screamingly funny. it 
looks like a cross between a filling station and a comic-strip idea of a rocket ship to the moon."

"you watch it in a couple of years," said eugene pettingill, "and see what happens. the thing'll 
collapse like a house of cards."

"why speak in terms of years?" said guy francon. "those modernistic stunts never last more 
than a season. the owner will get good and sick of it and he'll come running home to a good 
old early colonial."

the heller house acquired fame throughout the countryside surrounding it. people drove out 
of their way to park on the road before it, to stare, point and giggle. gas-station attendants

shopkeepers when she went on her errands. the heller house

guy francon read his daughter's articles; he heard of the remarks she had made at the 
reception and at the meeting of social workers. he understood nothing of it, but he understood 
that it had been precisely the sequence of events to expect from his daughter. it preyed on his 
mind, with the bewildered feeling of apprehension which the thought of her always brought 
him. he asked himself whether he actually hated his daughter.

but i can tell my kind of people by their faces. by something in their faces. there will be

with the latest news of the casting of i'll take a sailor and the shooting of wives for sale, 
came stories about the parthenon and the pantheon. miss sally o'dawn was photographed 
on the steps of the rheims cathedral--in a bathing suit, and mr. pratt ("pardner") purcell gave 
an interview, stating that he had always dreamed of being a master builder, if he hadn't been a 
movie actor. ralston holcombe, guy francon and gordon l. prescott were quoted on the 
future of american architecture--in an article written by miss dimples williams, and an 
imaginary interview quoted what sir christopher wren would have said about the motion 
picture. in the sunday supplements there were photographs of cosmo-slotnick starlets in 
shorts and sweaters, holding t-squares and slide-rules, standing before drawing boards that 
bore the legend: "cosmo-slotnick building" over a huge question mark.

then he seized the telephone, he spoke to a high, flat voice which belonged to ellsworth 
toohey's secretary, and he made an appointment to see toohey at four-thirty of the next 
afternoon.

in the hours that followed, his daily work assumed a new relish. it was as if his usual activity 
had been only a bright, flat mural and had now become a noble bas-relief, pushed forward, 
given a three-dimensional reality by the words of ellsworth toohey.

guy francon descended from his office once in a while, for no ascertainable purpose. the 
subtler shades of his shirts and socks matched the gray of his temples. he stood smiling 
benevolently in silence. keating flashed past him in the drafting room and acknowledged his 
presence, not stopping, but slowing his steps long enough to plant a crackling bit of 
newspaper into the folds of the mauve handkerchief in francon's breast-pocket, with "read 
that when you have time, guy." he added, his steps halfway a

his new home was one large room in a small, modern apartment house on a quiet street. he 
had chosen the house because it had no cornices over the windows and no paneling on the 
walls inside. his room contained a few pieces of simple furniture; it looked clean, vast and 
empty; one expected to hear echoes from its corners.

"why not go, just once?" said heller. "it won't be too awful. it might even amuse you. you'll 
see a lot of your old friends there. john erik snyte, peter keating, guy francon and his 
daughter--you should meet his daughter. have you ever read her stuff?"

peter keating was bewildered. dominique's sudden devotion to his career seemed dazzling, 
flattering, enormously profitable; everybody told him so; but there were moments when he did 
not feel dazzled or flattered; he felt uneasy.

he tried to avoid guy francon. "how did you do it, peter? how did you do it?" francon would 
ask. "she must be crazy about you! who'd every think that dominique of all people would...? 
and who'd think she could? she'd have made me a millionaire if she'd done her stuff five 
years ago. but then, of course, a father is not the same inspiration as a..." he caught an 
ominous look on keating's face and changed the end of his sentence to: "as her man, shall

building. an exact papier-mâché replica of his famous structure covered him from head to 
knees; one could not see his face, but his bright eyes peered from behind the windows of the 
top floor, and the crowning pyramid of the roof rose over his head; the colonnade hit him 
somewhere about the diaphragm, and he wagged a finger through the portals of the great 
entrance door. his legs were free to move with his usual elegance, in faultless dress trousers 
and patent-leather pumps.

guy francon was very impressive as the frink national bank building, although the structure 
looked a little squatter than in the original, in order to allow for francon's stomach; the hadrian 
torch over his head had a real electric bulb lit by a miniature battery. ralston holcombe was 
magnificent as a state capitol, and gordon l. prescott was very masculine as a grain elevator.

guy francon tried to object when he heard of it.

"listen, dominique," he said angrily, "there is a limit. there really is a limit--even for you. why 
are you doing it? why--for a building of roark's of all things? after everything you've said and 
done against him--do you wonder people are talking? nobody'd care or notice if it were 
anyone else. but you--and roark! i can't go anywhere without having somebody ask me about 
it. what am i to do?"

"will you give us your professional opinion of his work?"

"well, i think it's immature. very startling, even quite interesting at times, but essentially--
adolescent."

"then mr. roark cannot be called a full-fledged architect?"

"not in the sense in which we speak of mr. ralston holcombe, mr. guy francon, mr. gordon 
prescott--no. but, of course, i want to be fair. i think mr. roark had definite potentialities, 
particularly in problems of pure engineering. he could have made something of himself. i've 
tried to talk to him about it--i've tried to help him--i honestly did. but it was like talking to one of 
his pet pieces of reinforced concrete. i knew that he'd come to something like this. i wasn't

gentlemen."

s pocket; he had been 
packing a suitcase for his wedding trip of tomorrow. he glanced at the room and noted angrily 
how vulgar his victorian furniture looked beside the elegance of dominique's figure. she wore 
a gray suit, a black fur jacket with a collar raised to her cheeks, and a hat slanting down. she 
did not look as she had looked on the witness stand, nor as he remembered her at dinner 
parties. he thought suddenly of that moment, years ago, when he stood on the stair landing 
outside guy francon's office and wished never to see dominique again. she was what she 
had been then: a stranger who frightened him by the crystal emptiness of her face.

"well, sit down, dominique. take your coat off."

"no, i shan't stay long. since we're not pretending anything today, shall i tell you what i came 
for--or do you want some polite conversation first?"

 the attitude of the a.g.a. 
toward ellsworth toohey had not been cordial, particularly since the establishment of his 
council. but the trial brought a subtle change; many members pointed out that the article in 

"one small voice" had actually brought about the stoddard lawsuit; and that a man who could 
force clients to sue was a man to be treated with caution. so it was suggested that ellsworth 
toohey should be invited to address the a.g.a. at one of its luncheons. some members 
objected, guy francon among them. the most passionate objector was a young architect 
who made an eloquent speech, his voice trembling with the embarrassment of speaking in 
public for the first time; he said that he admired ellsworth toohey and had always agreed with 
toohey's social ideals, but if a group of people felt that some person was acquiring power 
over them, that was the time to fight such a person. the majority overruled him. ellsworth

dumont and bennett went ahead. keating changed a few roof lines on their sketches, a few 
windows. the preliminary drawings were approved by wynand's office. keating did not know 
whether wynand had approved in person. he did not see wynand again.

dominique had been away a month, when guy francon announced his retirement. keating 
had told him about the divorce, offering no explanation. francon had taken the news calmly. 
he had said: "i expected it. it's all right, peter. it's probably not your fault nor hers." he had not 
mentioned it since. now he gave no explanation of his retirement, only: "i told you it was 
coming, long ago. i'm tired. good luck, peter."

the responsibility of the firm on his lonely shoulders and the prospect of his solitary name on 
the office door left keating

it was only when the last painter had departed that peter keating felt a sense of desolation 
and a numb weakness in the crook of his elbows. he stood in the hall, looking up at the 
ceiling. under the harsh gloss of paint he could still see the outline of the square where the 
stairway had been removed and the opening closed over. guy francon's old office was gone. 
the firm keating & dumont had a single floor left now.

he thought of the stairway and how he had walked up its red-plushed steps for the first time, 
carrying a drawing on the tips of his fingers. he thought of guy francon's office with the 
glittering butterfly reflections. he thought of the four years when that office had been his own.

he had known what was happening to his firm, in these last years; he had known it quite well 
while men in overalls removed the stair

but what if the fair did flop? it had not hurt the other architects of its council. gordon l. 
prescott was going stronger than ever. it wasn't that, thought keating. it had begun before the 
fair. he could not say when.

there could be so many explanations. the depression had hit them all; others had recovered 
to some extent, keating & dumont had not. something had gone out of the firm and out of the 
circles from which it drew its clients, with the retirement of guy francon. keating realized that 
there had been art and skill and its own kind of illogical energy in the career of guy francon, 
even if the art consisted only of his social charm and the energy was directed at snaring 
bewildered millionaires. there had been a twisted sort of sense in people's response to guy 
francon.

he could see no hint of rationality in the things to which people responded now. the leader of 
the profession--on a mean scale, there was no grand scale left in anything--was gordon

s ruled the profession and talked about a closed shop, though no one had yet devised 
a way of achieving that. whenever an architect's name appeared in ellsworth toohey's 
column, it was always that of augustus webb. at thirty-nine, keating heard himself described 
as old-fashioned.

he had given up trying to understand. he knew dimly that the explanation of the change 
swallowing the world was of a nature he preferred not to know. in his youth he had felt an 
amicable contempt for the works of guy francon or ralston holcombe, and emulating them 
had seemed no more than innocent quackery. but he knew that gordon l. prescott and gus 
webb represented so impertinent, so vicious a fraud that to suspend the evidence of his eyes 
was beyond his elastic capacity. he had believed that people found greatness in holcombe 
and there had been a reasonable satisfaction in borrowing his borrowed greatness. he knew 
that no one saw anything whatever in prescott. he felt something dark and leering in the

guy francon telephoned dominique that evening. since his retirement he had lived alone on 
his country estate near the quarry town. she had refused to answer calls today, but she took 
the receiver when the maid told her that it was mr. francon. instead of the fury she expected, 
she heard a gentle voice saying:

"hello, dominique."

"hello, father."

the things he had not said and the quality of his voice, firm, simple and with a note that 
sounded close to happiness, made her answer, after a moment:

"all right, father." it was a girl's voice, a daughter's voice, with a tired, trusting, wistful gaiety. 
"i'll get there about midnight. have a glass of milk for me and some sandwiches."

"try not to speed as you always do. the roads aren't too good."

when she arrived, guy francon met her at the door. they both smiled, and she knew that 
there would be no questions, no reproaches. he led her to the small morning room where he 
had set the food on a table by a window open to a dark lawn. there was a smell of grass, 
candles on the table and a bunch of jasmine in a silver bowl.

she sat, her fingers closed about a cold glass, and he sat across the table, munching a 
sandwich peacefully.

"the motive which the state proposes to prove," the prosecutor was making his opening 
address to the jury, "is beyond the realm of normal human emotions. to the majority of us it 
will appear monstrous and inconceivable."

dominique sat with mallory, heller, lansing, enright, mike--and guy francon, to the shocked 
disapproval of his friends. across the aisle, celebrities formed a comet: from the small point of 
ellsworth toohey, well in front, a tail of popular names stretched through the crowd: lois 
cook, gordon l. prescott, gus webb, lancelot clokey, ike, jules fougler, sally brent, homer
