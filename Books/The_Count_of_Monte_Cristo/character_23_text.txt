occasions the countâ€™s _chasseur_ also. this valet, whose name was
germain, and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master, held
in one hand a number of papers, and in the other a packet of letters,
which he gave to albert. albert glanced carelessly at the different
missives, selected two written in a small and delicate hand, and
enclosed in scented envelopes, opened them and perused their contents
with some attention.

â€œhow did these letters come?â€ said he.

â€œone by the post, madame danglarsâ€™ footman left the other.â€

â€œlet madame danglars know that i accept the place she offers me in her
box. wait; then, during the day, tell rosa that when i leave the opera i
will sup with her as she wishes. take her six bottles of different wine-
-cyprus, sherry, and malaga, and a barrel of ostend oysters; get them at
borelâ€™s, and be sure you say they are for me.â€

â€œwhat time is it now?â€

â€œa quarter to ten.â€

yes, my lord,â€ replied the servant, â€œm. debray is with madame.â€
 danglars nodded his head; then, turning to monte cristo, said, â€œm.
lucien debray is an old friend of ours, and private secretary to the
minister of the interior. as for my wife, i must tell you, she lowered
herself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the most ancient
families in france. her maiden name was de serviÃ¨res, and her first
husband was colonel the marquis of nargonne.â€

â€œi have not the honor of knowing madame danglars; but i have already met
m. lucien debray.â€

â€œah, indeed?â€ said danglars; â€œand where was that?â€

â€œat the house of m. de morcerf.â€

â€œah, ha, you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?â€

â€œwe were together a good deal during the carnival at rome.â€

â€œtrue, true,â€ cried danglars. â€œlet me see; have i not heard talk of some
strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins, and of his
having had a miraculous escape? i forget how, but i know he used to

this charming apartment, the only one throughout the great mansion in
which any distinctive taste prevailed. the truth was, it had been
entirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by m. danglars
and his architect, who had been selected to aid the baron in the great
work of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and
celebrated decorator of the day. the decorations of the boudoir had then
been left entirely to madame danglars and lucien debray. m. danglars,
however, while possessing a great admiration for the antique, as it was
understood during the time of the directory, entertained the most
sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wifeâ€™s favorite
sitting-room, where, by the way, he was never permitted to intrude,
unless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more
agreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had rather the air and
manner of a person who was himself introduced, tha

madame danglars (who, although past the first bloom of youth, was still
strikingly handsome) was now seated at the piano, a most elaborate piece
of cabinet and inlaid work, while lucien debray, standing before a small
work-table, was turning over the pages of an album. lucien had found
time, preparatory to the countâ€™s arrival, to relate many particulars
respecting him to madame danglars. it will be remembered that monte
cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party
assembled at the breakf

ast given by albert de morcerf; and although
debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings, he had never
been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the
impressive look and manner of the count, consequently the description
given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own
heated imagination. already excited by the wonderful stories related of
the count by de morcerf, it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly
listened to, and fully credited, all the additional circumstances
detailed by debray. this posing at the piano and over the album was only
a little ruse adopted by way of precaution. a most gracious welcome and
unusual smile were bestowed on m. danglars; the count, in return for his
gentlemanly bow, received a formal though graceful courtesy, while
lucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition, and with
danglars a free and easy nod.

â€œbaroness,â€ said danglars, â€œgiv

correspondents at rome. i need but mention one fact to make all the
ladies in paris court his notice, and that is, that he has come to take
up his abode in paris for a year, during which brief period he proposes
to spend six millions of money. that means balls, dinners, and lawn
parties without end, in all of which i trust the count will remember us,
as he may depend upon it we shall him, in our own humble
entertainments.â€ in spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this
address, madame danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable
interest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months,
and who had selected paris for the scene of his princely extravagance.
â€œand when did you arrive here?â€ inquired she.

â€œyesterday morning, madame.â€

â€œcoming, as usual, i presume, from the extreme end of the globe? pardon
me--at least, such i have heard is your custom.â€

â€œnay, madame. this time i have merely come from cadiz.â€

â€œi have passed a considerable part of my life in the east, madame, and
you are doubtless aware that the orientals value only two things--the
fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.â€

â€œnay, count,â€ said the baroness, â€œit would have been somewhat more
gallant to have placed the ladies first.â€

â€œyou see, madame, how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor
to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.â€ at this instant the
favorite attendant of madame danglars entered the boudoir; approaching
her mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone. madame danglars
turned very pale, then exclaimed,--â€œi cannot believe it; the thing is
impossible.â€

â€œi assure you, madame,â€ replied the woman, â€œit is as i have said.â€
 turning impatiently towards her husband, madame danglars demanded, â€œis
this true?â€

â€œis what true, madame?â€ inquired danglars, visibly agitated.

â€œwhat my maid tells me.â€

â€œbut what does she tell you?â€

offered me this morning for them. some madman or fool, bent upon ruining
himself as fast as he can, actually sent his steward to me to purchase
them at any cost; and the fact is, i have gained 16,000 francs by the
sale of them. come, donâ€™t look so angry, and you shall have 4,000 francs
of the money to do what you like with, and eugÃ©nie shall have 2,000.
there, what do you think now of the affair? wasnâ€™t i right to part with
the horses?â€ madame danglars surveyed her husband with a look of
withering contempt.

â€œgreat heavens?â€ suddenly exclaimed debray.

â€œwhat is it?â€ asked the baroness.

â€œi cannot be mistaken; there are your horses! the very animals we were
speaking of, harnessed to the countâ€™s carriage!â€

â€œmy dappled grays?â€ demanded the baroness, springing to the window.
â€œâ€˜tis indeed they!â€ said she. danglars looked absolutely stupefied. â€œhow
very singular,â€ cried monte cristo with well-feigned astonishment.

few words in the ear of debray, who approached monte cristo, saying,
â€œthe baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses.â€

â€œi scarcely know,â€ replied the count; â€œit was a little surprise prepared
for me by my steward, and cost me--well, somewhere about 30,000 francs.â€
 debray conveyed the countâ€™s reply to the baroness. poor danglars looked
so crest-fallen and discomfited that monte cristo assumed a pitying air
towards him. â€œsee,â€ said the count,

dear baron, the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies,
and allow them to act as they please, and then, if any mischief follows,
why, at least, they have no one to blame but themselves.â€ danglars made
no reply; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between
himself and the baroness, whose frowning brow, like that of olympic
jove, predicted a storm. debray, who perceived the gathering clouds, and
felt no desire to witness the explosion of madame danglarsâ€™ rage,
suddenly recollected an appointment, which compelled him to take his
leave; while monte cristo, unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy
the advantages he hoped to obtain, made a farewell bow and departed,
leaving danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife.


â€œexcellent,â€ murmured monte cristo to himself, as he came away. â€œall has
gone according to my wishes. the domestic peace of this family is
henceforth in my hands. now, then, to play another master-stroke, by

glad to make. but,â€ he went on with his peculiar smile, â€œi am here in
paris, and have plenty of time before me--by and by will do for that.â€
 with these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home. two
hours afterwards, madame danglars received a most flattering epistle
from the count, in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite
â€œdappled grays,â€ protesting that he could not endure the idea of making
his entry into the parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that his
splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely womanâ€™s
regrets. the horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen
on them in the morning; only, by the countâ€™s orders, in the centre of

frantic. â€œwhere am i?â€ exclaimed she; â€œand to whom am i indebted for so
happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm?â€

â€œmadame,â€ answered the count, â€œyou are under the roof of one who esteems
himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further
continuance of your sufferings.â€

â€œmy wretched curiosity has brought all this about,â€ pursued the lady.
â€œall paris rung with the praises of madame danglarsâ€™ beautiful horses,
and i had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the
high praise given to them.â€

â€œis it possible,â€ exclaimed the count with well-feigned astonishment,
â€œthat these horses belong to the baroness?â€

â€œthey do, indeed. may i inquire if you are acquainted with madame

pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to madame danglars.â€

â€œi dare not return with those dreadful horses,â€ said madame de
villefort.

â€œyou will see,â€ replied monte cristo, â€œthat they will be as different as
possible in the hands of ali. with him they will be gentle and docile as
lambs.â€ ali had, indeed, given proof of this; for, approaching the
animals, who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty,
he rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic
vinegar, and wiped off the sweat and foam that cov

much difficulty that madame de villefort was more than two hours
returning to her residence in the faubourg saint-honorÃ©.


scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been
gone through when she wrote the following letter to madame danglars:--

â€œdear hermine,--i have just had a wonderful escape from the most
imminent danger, and i owe my safety to the very count of monte cristo

admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far
short of his merits. your horses got as far as ranelagh, when they

o young men perceived, for the first time, that the mandate
was addressed to them. leisurely turning round, they calmly scrutinized
the various countenances around them, as though demanding someone person
who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed
excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the challenge, the
friends turned again to the front of the theatre, and affected to busy
themselves with the stage. at this moment the door of the ministerâ€™s box
opened, and madame danglars, accompanied by her daughter, entered,
escorted by lucien debray, who assiduously conducted them to their
seats.

â€œha, ha,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œhere come some friends of yours,
viscount! what are you looking at there? donâ€™t you see they are trying
to catch your eye?â€ albert turned round, just in time to receive a
gracious wave of the fan from the baroness; as for mademoiselle eugÃ©nie,
she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes
even upon the business of th

s and consideration than
is usually bestowed on a governess.

the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of madame
danglars into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed
half-hourâ€™s interval allowed between the acts, and the audience were
left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to pay and receive
visits in their respective boxes. morcerf and chÃ¢teau-renaud were
amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission. for an instant
the idea struck madame danglars that this eagerness on the part of the
young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party, and she
whispered her expectations to her daughter, that albert was hurrying to
pay his respects to them. mademoiselle eugÃ©nie, however, merely returned
a dissenting movement of the head, while, with a cold smile, she
directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first
circle, in which sat the countess g----, and where morcerf had just made
his appearance. â€œso we meet again, my

â€™s diamonds; and so people talked of something else.â€

â€œmy good fellow,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œthe count is your friend and you
treat him accordingly. do not believe what albert is telling you,
countess; so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by
the appearance of the count of monte cristo having abated, i take upon
myself to declare that it is as strong as ever. his first astounding act
upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth 32,000
francs, to madame danglars; his second, the almost miraculous
preservation of madame de villefortâ€™s life; now it seems that he has
carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club. i therefore maintain,
in spite of morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest
at this present moment, but also that he will continue to be so for a
month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which,
after all, may be his ordinary mode of existence.â€

â€œperhaps you are right,â€ said morcerf; â€œmeanwhil

girl had attracted the attention of the whole house,
and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her
magnificent diamonds. the second act passed away during one continued
buzz of voices--one deep whisper--intimating that some great and
universally interesting event had occurred; all eyes, all thoughts, were
occupied with the young and beautiful woman, whose gorgeous apparel and
splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle. upon this occasion
an unmistakable sign from madame danglars intimated her desire to see
albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act, and
neither the politeness nor good taste of morcerf would permit his
neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given. at the close of the act
he therefore went to the baroness. having bowed to the two ladies, he
extended his hand to debray. by the baroness he was most graciously
welcomed, while eugÃ©nie received him with her accustomed coldness.

insists upon it that i can tell her his birth, education, and parentage,
where he came from, and whither he is going. being no disciple of
cagliostro, i was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of getting out of
the scrape, i said, â€˜ask morcerf; he has got the whole history of his
beloved monte cristo at his fingersâ€™ ends;â€™ whereupon the baroness
signified her desire to see you.â€

â€œis it not almost incredible,â€ said madame danglars, â€œthat a person
having at least half a million of secret-service money at his command,
should possess so little information?â€

â€œlet me assure you, madame,â€ said lucien, â€œthat had i really the sum you
mention at my disposal, i would employ it more profitably than in
troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the count of monte

as a nabob. however, i have turned the business over to morcerf, so pray

â€œi am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth
32,000 francs, wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000
francs each.â€

â€œhe seems to have a mania for diamonds,â€ said morcerf, smiling, â€œand i
verily believe that, like potemkin, he keeps his pockets filled, for the
sake of strewing them along the road, as tom thumb did his flint
stones.â€

â€œperhaps he has discovered some mine,â€ said madame danglars. â€œi suppose
you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baronâ€™s banking
establishment?â€

â€œi was not aware of it,â€ replied albert, â€œbut i can readily believe it.â€

â€œand, further, that he stated to m. danglars his intention of only
staying a year in paris, during which time he proposed to spend six
millions.

â€œhe must be the shah of persia, travelling _incog_.â€

â€œhave you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, m. lucien?â€
 inquired eugÃ©nie.

that she is a musician, for one day when i chanced to be breakfasting
with the count, i heard the sound of a guzla--it is impossible that it
could have been touched by any other finger than her own.â€

â€œthen your count entertains visitors, does he?â€ asked madame danglars.

â€œindeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, i can assure you.â€

â€œi must try and persuade m. danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner,
or something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in return.â€

â€œwhat,â€ said debray, laughing; â€œdo you really mean you would go to his
house?â€

â€œwhy not? my husband could accompany me.â€

â€œbut do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?â€

â€œif you like; but tell me, my dear lucien, what it is that constitutes a
princess. why, diamonds--and she is covered with them.â€

â€œto me she seems overloaded,â€ observed eugÃ©nie; â€œshe would look far
better if she wore fewer, and we should then be able to see her finely
formed throat and wrists.â€

â€œsee how the artist peeps out!â€ exclaimed madame danglars. â€œmy poor
eugÃ©nie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts.â€

â€œi admire all that is beautiful,â€ returned the young lady.

â€œwhat do you think of the count?â€ inquired debray; â€œhe is not much
amiss, according to my ideas of good looks.â€

â€œthe count,â€ repeated eugÃ©nie, as though it had not occurred to her to
observe him sooner; â€œthe count?--oh, he is so dreadfully pale.â€

â€œwhat for? why, to converse with him, of course. have you really no
desire to meet him?â€

â€œnone whatever,â€ replied eugÃ©nie.

larger than marmots; then, when you have carried off the golden trophy
of victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the first
handsome woman you think of!â€

â€œand who has filled your head with all this nonsense?â€

â€œwhy, in the first place, i heard it from madame danglars, who, by the

secondly, i learned it from beauchampâ€™s journal; and thirdly, from my
own imagination. why, if you sought concealment, did you call your horse

mademoiselle danglars bent her head slightly. â€œyou have a charming young
person with you tonight, count,â€ said eugÃ©nie. â€œis she your daughter?â€

â€œno, mademoiselle,â€ said monte cristo, astonished at the coolness and
freedom of the question. â€œshe is a poor unfortunate greek left under my
care.â€

â€œand what is her name?â€

â€œhaydÃ©e,â€ replied monte cristo.

â€œa greek?â€ murmured the count of morcerf.

â€œyes, indeed, count,â€ said madame danglars; â€œand tell me, did you ever
see at the court of ali tepelini, whom you so gloriously and valiantly
served, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?â€

â€œdid i hear rightly, monsieur,â€ said monte cristo â€œthat you served at
yanina?â€

â€œi was inspector-general of the pashaâ€™s troops,â€ replied morcerf; â€œand
it is no secret that i owe my fortune, such as it is, to the liberality
of the illustrious albanese chief.â€

 continued monte cristo, drawing a small phial from his pocket, â€œi have

daughter, exchanged a parting shake of the hand with debray and the
count, and left madame danglarsâ€™ box. upon his return to haydÃ©e he found
her still very pale. as soon as she saw him she seized his hand; her own
hands were moist and icy cold. â€œwho was it you were talking with over
there?â€ she asked.


â€œwith the count of morcerf,â€ answered monte cristo. â€œhe tells me he
served your illustrious father, and that he owes his fortune to him.â€

chapter 54. a flurry in stocks

some days after this meeting, albert de morcerf visited the count of
monte cristo at his house in the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es, which had already
assumed that palace-like appearance which the countâ€™s princely fortune
enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences. he came to
renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to
the count through the medium of a letter, signed â€œbaronne danglars,
_nÃ©e_ hermine de servieux.â€

albert was accompanied by lucien debray, who, joining in his friendâ€™s
conversation, added some passing compliments, the source of which the
countâ€™s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess. he was convinced
that lucienâ€™s visit was due to a double feeling of curiosity, the larger
half of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussÃ©e dâ€™anti

short, madame danglars, not being able personally to examine in detail
the domestic economy and household arrangements of a man who gave away
horses worth 30,000 francs and who went to the opera with a greek slave
wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money, had deputed those
eyes, by which she was accustomed to see, to give her a faithful account
of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person. but the count did
not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection

â€œand what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?â€ asked monte

â€œbecause,â€ said albert, laughing, â€œone piece of news follows another,
and there is often great dissimilarity between them.â€

â€œah,â€ said the count, â€œi see that m. danglars is accustomed to play at
gaining or losing 300,000 francs in a day; he must be enormously rich.â€

â€œit is not he who plays!â€ exclaimed lucien; â€œit is madame danglars; she
is indeed daring.â€

â€œbut you who are a reasonable being, lucien, and who knows how little
dependence is to be placed on the news, since you are at the fountain-
head, surely you ought to prevent it,â€ said morcerf, with a smile.

â€œhow can i, if her husband fails in controlling her?â€ asked lucien; â€œyou
know the character of the baroness--no one has any influence with her,
and she does precisely what she pleases.â€

â€œah, if i were in your place----â€ said albert.

â€œnow, speaking without any exaggeration, is your mother really so very
much averse to this marriage?â€

â€œso much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house, and my
mother, has not, i think, visited madame danglars twice in her whole
life.â€

â€œthen,â€ said the count, â€œi am emboldened to speak openly to you. m.
danglars is my banker; m. de villefort has overwhelmed me with
politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune
enabled me to render him. i predict from all this an avalanche of
dinners and routs. now, in order not to presume on this, and also to be
beforehand with them, i have, if agreeable to you, thought of inviting
m. and madame danglars, and m. and madame de villefo

m view by the large chestnut-trees, which on all sides spread their
luxuriant branches, we shall find some people of our acquaintance. this
time maximilian was the first to arrive. he was intently watching for a
shadow to appear among the trees, and awaiting with anxiety the sound of
a light step on the gravel walk. at length, the long-desired sound was
heard, and instead of one figure, as he had expected, he perceived that
two were approaching him. the delay had been occasioned by a visit from
madame danglars and eugÃ©nie, which had been prolonged beyond the time at
which valentine was expected. that she might not appear to fail in her
promise to maximilian, she proposed to mademoiselle danglars that they
should take a walk in the garden, being anxious to show that the delay,
which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him, was not occasioned by
any neglect on her part. the young man, with the intuitive perception of
a lover, quickly understood the circumstances in which she was
involuntarily placed,

â€œif such be the case, my dear valentine, you must yourself have felt, or
at all events will soon feel, the effects of his presence. he meets
albert de morcerf in italy--it is to rescue him from the hands of the
banditti; he introduces himself to madame danglars--it is that he may
give her a royal present; your step-mother and her son pass before his
door--it is that his nubian may save them from destruction. this man
evidently possesses the power of influencing events, both as regards men
and things. i never saw more simple tastes united to greater
magnificence. his smile is so sweet when he addresses me, that i forget
it ever can be bitter to others. ah, valentine, tell me, if he ever
looked on you with one of those sweet smiles? if so, depend on it,

but her whole hand through the opening. maximilian uttered a cry of
delight, and, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards him,
and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss. the little hand was
then immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw valentine hurrying
towards the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own
sensations.



chapter 58. m. noirtier de villefort

we will now relate what was passing in the house of the kingâ€™s attorney
after the departure of madame danglars and her daughter, and during the
time of the conversation between maximilian and valentine, which we have
just detailed. m. de villefort entered his fatherâ€™s room, followed by
madame de villefort. both of the visitors, after saluting the old man
and speaking to barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five
years in his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.

m. noirtier was sitting in an armchair, which moved upon casters, in
which he was wheeled into the room in

â€œi should think so,--a horse that cost 5,000 francs!â€ said monte cristo,
in the tone which a father would use towards a son.

â€œdo you regret them?â€ asked morrel, with his open laugh.

â€œi? certainly not,â€ replied the count. â€œno; i should only regret if the
horse had not proved good.â€

â€œit is so good, that i have distanced m. de chÃ¢teau-renaud, one of the
best riders in france, and m. debray, who both mount the ministerâ€™s
arabians; and close on their heels are the horses of madame danglars,
who always go at six leagues an hour.â€

â€œthen they follow you?â€ asked monte cristo.

â€œsee, they are here.â€ and at the same minute a carriage with smoking
horses, accompanied by two mounted gentlemen, arrived at the gate, which
opened before them. the carriage drove round, and stopped at the steps,
followed by the horsemen. the instant debray had touched the ground, he
was at the carriage-door. he offered his hand to the baroness, who,
descending, took it with a peculiarity of manner

he observed a little note, passed with the facility that indicates
frequent practice, from the hand of madame danglars to that of the
ministerâ€™s secretary. after his wife the banker descended, as pale as
though he had issued from his tomb instead of his carriage. madame
danglars threw a rapid and inquiring glance which could only be
interpreted by monte cristo, around the courtyard, over the peristyle,
and across the front of the house, then, repressing a slight emotion,
which must have been seen on her countenance if she had not kept her
color, she ascended the steps, saying to morrel, â€œsir, if you were a

afraid; and a brave captain of spahis cannot risk this, even to gratify
a pretty woman, which is, in my opinion, one of the most sacred
obligations in the world.â€

â€œyou see my position, madame,â€ said morrel, bestowing a grateful smile
on monte cristo.

â€œit seems to me,â€ said danglars, in his coarse tone, ill-concealed by a
forced smile, â€œthat you have already got horses enough.â€ madame danglars
seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed, but, to the
surprise of the young people, she pretended not to hear it, and said
nothing. monte cristo smiled at her unusual humility, and showed her two
immense porcelain jars, over which wound marine plants, of a size and
delicacy that nature alone could produce. the baroness was astonished.
â€œwhy,â€ said she, â€œyou could plant one of the chestnut-trees in the
tuileries inside! how can such enormous jars have been manufactured?â€

â€œtry to spend it all. they have some business with you, i think, from
what they told me the day before yesterday. i, indeed, invited them here
today on your account. i will introduce you to them.â€

â€œbut they appear to speak french with a very pure accent,â€ said
danglars.

â€œthe son has been educated in a college in the south; i believe near
marseilles. you will find him quite enthusiastic.â€

â€œupon what subject?â€ asked madame danglars.

â€œthe french ladies, madame. he has made up his mind to take a wife from
paris.â€

â€œa fine idea that of his,â€ said danglars, shrugging his shoulders.
madame danglars looked at her husband with an expression which, at any
other time, would have indicated a storm, but for the second time she
controlled herself. â€œthe baron appears thoughtful today,â€ said monte
cristo to her; â€œare they going to put him in the ministry?â€

â€œnot yet, i think. more likely he has been speculating on th

villefort, notwithstanding his self-control, was visibly affected, and
when monte cristo touched his hand, he felt it tremble. â€œcertainly,
women alone know how to dissimulate,â€ said monte cristo to himself,
glancing at madame danglars, who was smiling on the procureur, and
embracing his wife. after a short time, the count saw bertuccio, who,
until then, had been occupied on the other side of the house, glide into
an adjoining room. he went to him. â€œwhat do you want, m. bertuccio?â€
 said he.

â€œyour excellency has not stated the number of guests.â€

â€œah, true.â€

â€œhow many covers?â€

â€œcount for yourself.â€

â€œis everyone here, your excellency?â€

â€œyes.â€

bertuccio glanced through the door, which was ajar.

â€œmadame danglars?â€

â€œi do not know her name; but it is she, sir, it is she!â€

â€œwhom do you mean?â€

â€œthe woman of the garden!--she that was _enciente_--she who was walking

bertuccio stood at the open door, with his eyes starting and his hair on
end.

â€œwaiting for whom?â€ bertuccio, without answering, pointed to villefort
with something of the gesture macbeth uses to point out banquo. â€œoh,

â€œwhat? who?â€

danglars had started when villefort, on the countâ€™s invitation, offered
his arm; and villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold
spectacles, when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own.
none of this had escaped the count, and even by this mere contact of
individuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an
observer. m. de villefort had on the right hand madame danglars, on his
left morrel. the count was seated between madame de villefort and
danglars; the other seats were filled by debray, who was placed between
the two cavalcanti, and by chÃ¢teau-renaud, seated between madame de
villefort and morrel.

the repast was magnificent; monte cristo had endeavored completely to
overturn the parisian ideas, and to feed the curiosity as much as the
appetite of his guests. it was an oriental feast that he offered to
them, but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might

â€œbut why have two of each sort?â€ asked danglars.

â€œmerely because one might have died,â€ carelessly answered monte cristo.

â€œyou are certainly an extraordinary man,â€ said danglars; â€œand
philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich.â€

â€œand to have ideas,â€ added madame danglars.

â€œoh, do not give me credit for this, madame; it was done by the romans,
who much esteemed them, and pliny relates that they sent slaves from

looked inquiringly at his guests. madame de villefort rose, monte cristo
did the same, and the rest followed their example. villefort and madame
danglars remained for a moment, as if rooted to their seats; they
questioned each other with vague and stupid glances.

â€œdid you hear?â€ said madame danglars.

brothers-in-law, was forced by them to take poison; and they finished
her off with pistol and dagger.--ed.

china, of fanciful colors, fantastic design, and wonderful texture. at
length they arrived at the famous room. there was nothing particular
about it, excepting that, although daylight had disappeared, it was not
lighted, and everything in it was old-fashioned, while the rest of the
rooms had been redecorated. these two causes were enough to give it a
gloomy aspect.

â€œoh.â€ cried madame de villefort, â€œit is really frightful.â€


madame danglars tried to utter a few words, but was not heard. many
observations were made, the import of which was a unanimous opinion that
there was something sinister about the room.

â€œis it not so?â€ asked monte cristo. â€œlook at that large clumsy bed, hung
with such gloomy, blood-colored drapery! and those two crayon portraits,
that have faded from the dampness; do they not seem to say, with their
pale lips and staring eyes, â€˜we have seenâ€™?â€ villefort became livid;

 said madame de villefort, smiling, â€œare you courageous enough to sit

 madame danglars rose suddenly.

â€œand then,â€ said monte cristo, â€œthis is not all.â€

â€œwhat is there more?â€ said debray, who had not failed to notice the
agitation of madame danglars.

â€œah, what else is there?â€ said danglars; â€œfor, at present, i cannot say
that i have seen anything extraordinary. what do you say, m.
cavalcanti?â€

â€œah,â€ said he, â€œwe have at pisa, ugolinoâ€™s tower; at ferrara, tassoâ€™s
prison; at rimini, the room of francesca and paolo.â€

â€œyes, but you have not this little staircase,â€ said monte cristo,
opening a door concealed by the drapery. â€œlook at it, and tell me what
you think of it.â€

ever since valentineâ€™s dowry had been mentioned, morrel had been silent
and sad. â€œcan you imagine,â€ said monte cristo, â€œsome othello or abbÃ© de
ganges, one stormy, dark night, descending these stairs step by step,
carrying a load, which he wishes to hide from the sight of man, if not
from god?â€ madame danglars half fainted on the arm of villefort, who was
obliged to support himself against the wall. â€œah, madame,â€ cried debray,
â€œwhat is the matter with you? how pale you look!â€

â€œit is very evident what is the matter with her,â€ said madame de
villefort; â€œm. de monte cristo is relating horrible stories to us,
doubtless intending to frighten us to death.â€

â€œyes,â€ said villefort, â€œreally, count, you frighten the ladies.â€

â€œwill you come into the garden?â€ said debray, advancing towards the back
staircase.

â€œno, no,â€ she answered, â€œi would rather remain here.â€

â€œare you really frightened, madame?â€ said monte cristo.

â€œoh, no, sir,â€ said madame danglars; â€œbut you suppose scenes in a manner
which gives them the appearance of reality.â€


â€œah, yes,â€ said monte cristo smiling; â€œit is all a matter of
imagination. why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest
mother? and this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the goddess
lucina? and that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not to
disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father
carrying the sleeping child?â€ here madame danglars, instead of

â€œoh, _mon dieu!_â€ said monte cristo, â€œand i have forgotten my smelling-

â€œi have mine,â€ said madame de villefort; and she passed over to monte
cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good
properties the count had tested on edward.

â€œah,â€ said monte cristo, taking it from her hand.

â€œyes,â€ she said, â€œat your advice i have made the trial.â€

â€œand have you succeeded?â€

â€œi think so.â€

madame danglars was carried into the adjoining room; monte cristo
dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she
returned to consciousness. â€œah,â€ she cried, â€œwhat a frightful dream!â€

villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream. they
looked for m. danglars, but, as he was not especially interested in
poetical ideas, he had gone into the garden, and was talking with major
cavalcanti on the projected railway from leghorn to florence. monte

differently, according to the mood of our minds.â€ villefort forced a
laugh. â€œand then, you know,â€ he said, â€œan idea, a supposition, is
sufficient.â€

â€œyes, before witnesses.â€

â€œoh, this is very interesting,â€ said debray; â€œif there really has been a
crime, we will investigate it.â€

â€œthere has been a crime,â€ said monte cristo. â€œcome this way, gentlemen;
come, m. villefort, for a declaration to be available, should be made
before the competent authorities.â€ he then took villefortâ€™s arm, and, at
the same time, holding that of madame danglars under his own, he dragged
the procureur to the plantain-tree, where the shade was thickest. all
the other guests followed. â€œstay,â€ said monte cristo, â€œhere, in this
very spotâ€ (and he stamped upon the ground), â€œi had the earth dug up and
fresh mould put in, to refresh these old trees; well, my man, digging,
found a box, or rather, the iron-work of a box, in the midst of which
was the skeleton of a newly born infant.â€ monte cristo felt the arm of

â€œah, indeed?â€ said cavalcanti.

â€œi think so; am i not right, m. de villefort?â€ asked monte cristo.

â€œyes, count,â€ replied villefort, in a voice now scarcely human.

monte cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this
scene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far,
said, â€œcome, gentlemen,--some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,â€ and
he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn.

â€œindeed, count,â€ said madame danglars, â€œi am ashamed to own it, but all
your frightful stories have so upset me, that i must beg you to let me
sit down;â€ and she fell into a chair. monte cristo bowed, and went to
madame de villefort. â€œi think madame danglars again requires your
bottle,â€ he said. but before madame de villefort could reach her friend
the procureur had found time to whisper to madame danglars, â€œi must
speak to you.â€

â€œwhen?â€

â€œtomorrow.â€

â€œwhere?â€

â€œin my office, or in the court, if you like,

at this moment madame de villefort approached.

chapter 64. the beggar

the evening passed on; madame de villefort expressed a desire to return
to paris, which madame danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding the
uneasiness she experienced. on his wifeâ€™s request, m. de villefort was
the first to give the signal of departure. he offered a seat in his
landau to madame danglars, that she might be under the care of his wife.
as for m. danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with m.
cavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing. while
monte cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of madame de villefort, he
had noticed the approach of villefor

t to madame danglars, and he soon
guessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been
uttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by madame danglars.
without opposing their arrangements, he allowed morrel, chÃ¢teau-renaud,
and debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in m. de villefortâ€™s
carriage. danglars, more and more delighted with major cavalcanti, had
offered him a seat in his carriage. andrea cavalcanti found his tilbury
waiting at the door; the groom, in every respect a caricature of the
english fashion, was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray horse.

andrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent

turned to the left,
galloped across the carrousel, passed through the rue saint-roch, and,
issuing from the rue de la michodiÃ¨re, he arrived at m. danglarsâ€™ door
just at the same time that villefortâ€™s landau, after having deposited
him and his wife at the faubourg saint-honorÃ©, stopped to leave the
baroness at her own house. debray, with the air of a man familiar with
the house, entered first into the court, threw his bridle into the hands
of a footman, and returned to the door to receive madame danglars, to
whom he offered his arm, to conduct her to her apartments. the gate once
closed, and debray and the baroness alone in the court, he asked,--â€œwhat
was the matter with you, hermine? and why were you so affected at that
story, or rather fable, which the count related?â€

â€œbecause i have been in such shocking spirits all the evening, my
friend,â€ said the baroness.

â€œno, hermine,â€ replied debray; â€œyou cannot make me believe that; on the
contrary, you were in excellent spirits when y

ou arrived at the countâ€™s.
m. danglars was disagreeable, certainly, but i know how much you care
for his ill-humor. someone has vexed you; i will allow no one to annoy
you.â€

â€œyou are deceived, lucien, i assure you,â€ replied madame danglars; â€œand
what i have told you is really the case, added to the ill-humor you
remarked, but which i did not think it worth while to allude to.â€ it was
evident that madame danglars was suffering from that nervous
irritability which women frequently cannot account for even to
themselves; or that, as debray had guessed, she had experienced some
secret agitation that she would not acknowledge to anyone. being a man
who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent
penalties of womanhood, he did not then press his inquiries, but waited
for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her,
or receive an avowal _proprio motu_. at the door of

baroness met mademoiselle cornÃ©lie, her confidential maid. â€œwhat is my

â€œshe practiced all the evening, and then went to bed,â€ replied
mademoiselle cornÃ©lie.

â€œyet i think i hear her piano.â€

â€œit is mademoiselle louise dâ€™armilly, who is playing while mademoiselle
danglars is in bed.â€

â€œwell,â€ said madame danglars, â€œcome and undress me.â€ they entered the
bedroom. debray stretched himself upon a large couch, and madame
danglars passed into her dressing-room with mademoiselle cornÃ©lie. â€œmy
dear m. lucien,â€ said madame danglars through the door, â€œyou are always
complaining that eugÃ©nie will not address a word to you.â€

as a friend of the house, expected to be caressed, â€œi am not the only

â€œmy study?â€

â€œat least that of the minister.â€

â€œwhy so!â€

â€œto ask for an engagement at the opera. really, i never saw such an
infatuation for music; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of
fashion.â€ debray smiled. â€œwell,â€ said he, â€œlet her come, with your
consent and that of the baron, and we will try and give her an
engagement, though we are very poor to pay such talent as h

â€œgo, cornÃ©lie,â€ said madame danglars, â€œi do not require you any longer.â€

cornÃ©lie obeyed, and the next minute madame danglars left her room in a
charming loose dress, and came and sat down close to debray. then she
began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel. lucien looked at her
for a moment in silence. â€œcome, hermine,â€ he said, after a short time,
â€œanswer candidly,--something vexes you--is it not so?â€

â€œnothing,â€ answered the baroness.


and yet, as she could scarcely breathe, she rose and went towards a
looking-glass. â€œi am frightful tonight,â€ she said. debray rose, smiling,

at the noise of the door madame danglars turned round, and looked upon
her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble to conceal. â€œgood-
evening, madame,â€ said the banker; â€œgood-evening, m. debray.â€

probably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire
to make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day. assuming a
dignified air, she turned round to debray, without answering her
husband. â€œread me something, m. debray,â€ she said. debray, who was
slightly disturbed at this visit, recovered hi

he was looking to see the closing stock quotations. the result was, that
the proud look entirely failed of its purpose.

â€œm. lucien,â€ said the baroness, â€œi assure you i have no desire to sleep,
and that i have a thousand things to tell you this evening, which you
must listen to, even though you slept while hearing me.â€

â€œi am at your service, madame,â€ replied lucien coldly.

â€œmy dear m. debray,â€ said the banker, â€œdo not kill yourself tonight
listening to the follies of madame danglars, for you can hear them as
well tomorrow; but i claim tonight and will devote it, if you will allow

was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that lucien and the baroness
were staggered, and they interrogated each other with their eyes, as if
to seek help against this aggression, but the irresistible will of the
master of the house prevailed, and the husband was victorious.

madame danglars was rooted to the spot; she made a violent effort to
reply to this last attack, but she fell upon a chair thinking of
villefort, of the dinner scene, of the strange series of misfortunes
which had taken place in her house during the last few days, and changed
the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate.
danglars did not even look at her, though she did her best to faint. he
shut the bedroom door after him, without adding another word, and
returned to his apartments; and

the day following this scene, at the hour the banker usually chose to
pay a visit to madame danglars on his way to his office, his _coupÃ©_ did
not appear. at this time, that is, about half-past twelve, madame
danglars ordered her carriage, and went out. danglars, hidden behind a
curtain, watched the departure he had been waiting for. he gave orders
that he should be informed as soon as madame danglars appeared; but at
two oâ€™clock she had not returned. he then called for his horses, drove
to the chamber, and inscribed his name to speak against the budget. from
twelve to two oâ€™clock danglar

â€œand if you should hear of anything very scandalous----â€

â€œi will communicate it to you.â€

leap into his _coupÃ©_.



chapter 67. the office of the kingâ€™s attorney

let us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed, and
follow madame danglars in her morning excursion. we have said that at
half-past twelve oâ€™clock madame danglars had ordered her horses, and had
left home in the carriage. she directed her course towards the faubourg
saint germain, went down the rue mazarine, and stopped at the passage du
pont-neuf. she descended, and went through the passage. she was very
plainly dressed, as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in
the morning. at the rue guÃ©nÃ©gaud she called a cab, and directed the
driver to go to the r

ue de harlay. as soon as she was seated in the
vehicle, she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil, which she
tied on to her straw bonnet. she then replaced the bonnet, and saw with
pleasure, in a little pocket-mirror, that her white complexion and
brilliant eyes were alone visible. the cab crossed the pont-neuf and
entered the rue de harlay by the place dauphinÃ©; the driver was paid as
the door opened, and stepping lightly up the stairs madame danglars soon
reached the salle des pas-perdus.

there was a great deal going on that morning, and many business-like
persons at the palais; business-like persons pay very little attention
to women, and madame danglars crossed the hall without exciting any more
attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer. there was a
great press of people in m. de villefortâ€™s antechamber, but madame
danglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name. the instant she
appeared the door-keeper rose, came to h

th his back towards the door; he did not move as he
heard it open, and the door-keeper pronounce the words, â€œwalk in,
madame,â€ and then reclose it; but no sooner had the manâ€™s footsteps
ceased, than he started up, drew the bolts, closed the curtains, and
examined every corner of the room. then, when he had assured himself
that he could neither be seen nor heard, and was consequently relieved
of doubts, he said,--â€œthanks, madame,--thanks for your punctuality;â€ and
he offered a chair to madame danglars, which she accepted, for her heart
beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated.


â€œit is a long time, madame,â€ said the procureur, describing a half-
circle with his chair, so as to place himself exactly opposite to madame
danglars,--â€œit is a long time since i had the pleasure of speaking alone
with you, and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful
conversation.â€

â€œnevertheless, sir, you see i have answered your first appeal, although
certainly the conversation
 
 ___________________________
 
 must be much more painful for me than for
you.â€ villefort smiled bitterly.

â€œit is true, then,â€ he said, rather uttering his thoughts aloud than
addressing his companion,--â€œit is true, then, that all our actions leave
their traces--some sad, others bright--on our paths; it is true that
every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the sands;--
it leaves its track! alas, to many the path is traced by tears.â€

â€œsir,â€ said madame danglars, â€œyou can feel for my emotion, can you not?
spare me, then, i beseech you. when i look at this room,--whence so many
guilty creatures have departed, trembling and ashamed, when i look at
that chair before which i now sit trembling and ashamed,--oh, it
requires all my reason to convince me that i am not a very guilty woman
and you a menacing judge.â€ villefort dropped his head and sighed. â€œand
i,â€ he said, â€œi feel that my place is not in the judgeâ€™s seat, but on
the prisonerâ€™s stool

â€œyou?â€ said madame danglars.

â€œyes, i.â€

â€œi think, sir, you exaggerate your situation,â€ said madame danglars,
whose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment. â€œthe paths of which you were
just speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations.
besides the pleasure, there is always remorse from the indulgence of our
passions, and, after all, what have you men to fear from all this? the
world excuses, and notoriety ennobles you.â€

least, that i never deceive without a reason. if my brow be severe, it

women, on the contrary, are rarely tormented with remorse; for the
decision does not come from you,--your misfortunes are generally imposed
upon you, and your faults the results of othersâ€™ crimes.â€

â€œin any case, sir, you will allow,â€ replied madame danglars, â€œthat, even
if the fault were alone mine, i last night received a severe punishment
for it.â€

â€œpoor thing,â€ said villefort, pressing her hand, â€œit was too severe for
your strength, for you were twice overwhelmed, and yet----â€

â€œwell, i must tell you. collect all your courage, for you have not yet

mine, which i never even kissed, but for whom i wept many, many tears.
ah, my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found
beneath the flowers.â€

â€œwell, no, madame,--this is the terrible news i have to tell you,â€ said
villefort in a hollow voice--â€œno, nothing was found beneath the flowers;
there was no child disinterred--no. you must not weep, no, you must not
groan, you must tremble!â€

â€œwhat can you mean?â€ asked madame danglars, shuddering.

â€œi mean that m. de monte cristo, digging underneath these trees, found
neither skeleton nor chest, because neither of them was there!â€

â€œneither of them there?â€ repeated madame danglars, her staring, wide-
open eyes expressing her alarm.

â€œneither of them there!â€ she again said, as though striving to impress
herself with the meaning of the words which escaped her.

â€œno,â€ said villefort, burying his face in his hands, â€œno, a hundred
times no!â€

â€œthen you did n

â€œyou recollect that sad night, when you were half-expiring on that bed
in the red damask room, while i, scarcely less agitated than you,
awaited your delivery. the child was born, was given to me--motionless,
breathless, voiceless; we thought it dead.â€ madame danglars moved
rapidly, as though she would spring from her chair, but villefort
stopped, and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention. â€œwe
thought it dead,â€ he repeated; â€œi placed it in the chest, which was to
take the place of a coffin; i descended to the garden, i dug a hole, and
then flung it down in haste. scarcely had i covered it with earth, when
the arm of the corsican was stretched towards me; i saw a shadow rise,
and, at the same time, a flash of light. i felt pain; i wished to c

resting-place for persons walking in the garden; in falling, my hand,
relaxing its hold of the laburnum, felt the coldness of the stone. on my
right i saw the tree, behind me the rock. i stood in the same attitude,
and threw myself down. i rose, and again began digging and enlarging the
hole; still i found nothing, nothing--the chest was no longer there!â€


â€œthe chest no longer there?â€ murmured madame danglars, choking with
fear.

â€œthink not i contented myself with this one effort,â€ continued
villefort. â€œno; i searched the whole thicket. i thought the assassin,
having discovered the chest, and supposing it to be a treasure, had
intended carrying it off, but, perceiving his error, had dug another
hole, and deposited it there; but i could find nothing. then the idea
struck me that he had not taken these precautions, and had simply thrown
it in a corner. in the last case i must wait for daylight t

nothing. then i renewed the search. supposing it had been thrown aside,
it would probably be on the path which led to the little gate; but this
examination was as useless as the first, and with a bursting heart i
returned to the thicket, which now contained no hope for me.â€

â€œoh,â€ cried madame danglars, â€œit was enough to drive you mad!â€

â€œi hoped for a moment that it might,â€ said villefort; â€œbut that
happiness was denied me. however, recovering my strength and my ideas,
â€˜why,â€™ said i, â€˜should that man have carried away the corpse?â€™â€

â€œbut you said,â€ replied madame danglars, â€œhe would require it as a
proof.â€

â€œah, no, madame, that could not be. dead bodies are not kept a year;
they are shown to a magistrate, and the evidence is taken. now, nothing
of the kind has

â€œwhat then?â€ asked hermine, trembling violently.

â€œsomething more terrible, more fatal, more alarming for us--the child
was, perhaps, alive, and the assassin may have saved it!â€

madame danglars uttered a piercing cry, and, seizing villefortâ€™s hands,
exclaimed, â€œmy child was alive?â€ said she; â€œyou buried my child alive?
you were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it? ah----â€

madame danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands
she wrung in her feeble grasp. â€œi know not; i merely suppose so, as i
might suppose anything else,â€ replied villefort with a look so fixed, it
indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and
madness. â€œah, my child, my poor child!â€ cried the baroness, falling on
her chair, and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief. villefort,
becoming somewhat reassured, perceived that to avert the maternal storm

ead, he must inspire madame danglars with the terror
he felt. â€œyou understand, then, that if it were so,â€ said he, rising in
his turn, and approaching the baroness, to speak to her in a lower tone,
â€œwe are lost. this child lives, and someone knows it lives--someone is
in possession of our secret; and since monte cristo speaks before us of
a child disinterred, when that child could not be found, it is he who is
in possession of our secret.â€

â€œjust god, avenging god!â€ murmured madame danglars.

villefortâ€™s only answer was a stifled groan.

â€œbut the child--the child, sir?â€ repeated the agitated mother.

â€œhow i have searched for him,â€ replied villefort, wringing his hands;
â€œhow i have called him in my long sleepless nights; how i have longed
for royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men,
and to find mine among them! at last, one day, when for the hundredth
time i took up my spade, i asked myself again and again what the

perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive, he had thrown it into the
river.â€

â€œimpossible!â€ cried madame danglars: â€œa man may murder another out of
revenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child.â€

â€œperhaps,â€ continued villefort, â€œhe had put it in the foundling
hospital.â€

â€œoh, yes, yes,â€ cried the baroness; â€œmy child is there!â€

â€œi ran to the hospital, and learned that the same night--the night of
the 20th of september--a child had been brought there, wrapped in part
of a fine linen napkin, purposely torn in half. this portion of the
napkin was marked with half a baronâ€™s crow

â€œtruly, truly,â€ said madame danglars, â€œall my linen is marked thus;
monsieur de nargonne was a baron, and my name is hermine. thank god, my
child was not then dead!â€

â€œno, it was not dead.â€

â€œand you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy? where is
the child?â€ villefort shrugged his shoulders. â€œdo i know?â€ said he; â€œand
do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and
all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer? alas, no, i
know not. a woman, about six months afte

other half of the napkin. this woman gave all the requisite particulars,
and it was intrusted to her.â€

â€œbut you should have inquired for the woman; you should have traced
her.â€

â€œand what do you think i did? i feigned a criminal process, and employed
all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her. they
traced her to chÃ¢lons, and there they lost her.â€

â€œthey lost her?â€

â€œyes, forever.â€ madame danglars had listened to this recital with a
sigh, a tear, or a shriek for every detail. â€œand this is all?â€ said she;
â€œand you stopped there?â€

â€œoh, no,â€ said villefort; â€œi never ceased to search and to inquire.
however, the last two or three years i had allowed myself some respite.
but now i will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever, since
fear urges me, not my conscience.â€

â€œbut,â€ replied madame danglars, â€œthe count of monte cristo can know

pronounced these words with an accent which would have made the count
shudder had he heard him. then he pressed the hand the baroness
reluctantly gave him, and led her respectfully back to the door. madame
danglars returned in another cab to the passage, on the other side of
which she found her carriage, and her coachman sleeping peacefully on
his box while waiting for her.



chapter 68. a summer ball

the same day during the interview between madame danglars and the
procureur, a travelling-carriage entered the rue du helder, passed
through the gateway of no. 27, and stopped in the yard. in a moment the
door was opened, and madame de morcerf alighted, leaning on her sonâ€™s
arm. albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his
toilet, drove to the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es, to the house of monte cristo. the
count received him with his habitual smile. it was a strange thing that
no one ever appeared to advance a step in that manâ€™s favor. th

â€œnot so fast; m. andrea only calls himself count.â€

â€œcalls himself, do you say?â€

â€œyes, calls himself.â€

â€œis he not a count?â€

â€œwhat can i know of him? he calls himself so. i, of course, give him the
same title, and everyone else does likewise.â€

â€œwhat a strange man you are! what next? you say m. danglars dined here?â€

â€œyes, with count cavalcanti, the marquis his father, madame danglars, m.
and madame de villefort,--charming people,--m. debray, maximilian

â€œdid they speak of me?â€

â€œnot a word.â€

â€œso much the worse.â€

â€œwhy so? i thought you wished them to forget you?â€

â€œif they did not speak of me, i am sure they thought about me, and i am
in despair.â€

â€œhow will that affect you, since mademoiselle danglars was not among the
number here who thought of you? truly, she might have thought of you at
home.â€

â€œshe went to the palais,â€ replied the steward.

â€œdid she stay long there?â€

â€œan hour and a half.â€

â€œdid she return home?â€

â€œdirectly.â€

â€œwell, my dear bertuccio,â€ said the count, â€œi now advise you to go in
quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy.â€ bertuccio
bowed, and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had
received, he started the same evening.



chapter 69. the inquiry

m. de villefort kept the promise he had made to madame danglars, to
endeavor to find out how the count of monte cristo had discovered the
history of the house at auteuil. he wrote the same day for the required
information to m. de boville, who, from having been an inspector of
prisons, was promoted to a high office in the police; and the latter
begged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely
to give him full particulars. at the end of the second day m. de
villefort received the following note:--

at the time the countess of morcerf returned to the rooms, after giving
her orders, many guests were arriving, more attracted by the charming
hospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the
count; for, owing to the good taste of mercÃ©dÃ¨s, one was sure of finding
some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing, or even copying
in case of need. madame danglars, in whom the events we have related had
caused deep anxiety, had hesitated about going to madame de morcerfâ€™s,
when during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of villefort.
the latter made a sign, and when the carriages had drawn close together,
said, â€œyou are going to madame de morcerfâ€™s, are you not?â€

â€œno,â€ replied madame danglars, â€œi am too ill.â€

â€œyou are wrong,â€ replied villefort, significantly; â€œit is important that
you should be seen there.â€

â€œdo you

 think so?â€ asked the baroness.

â€œi do.â€

â€œin that case i will go.â€ and the two carriages passed on towards their
different destinations. madame danglars therefore came, not only
beautiful in person, but radiant with splendor; she entered by one door
at the time when mercÃ©dÃ¨s appeared at the door. the countess took albert
to meet madame danglars. he approached, paid her some well merited
compliments on her toilet, and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat.
albert looked around him. â€œyou are looking for my daughter?â€ said the
baroness, smiling.

â€œi confess it,â€ replied albert. â€œcould you have been so cruel as not to
bring her?â€

â€œcalm yourself. she has met mademoiselle de villefort, and has taken her
arm; see, they are following us, both in white dresses, one with a
bouquet of camellias, the other with one of myosotis.

â€œno, you will be deprived of that pleasure; her position in the countâ€™s

â€œwait; leave me here, and go and speak to madame de villefort, who is
trying to attract your attention.â€

albert bowed to madame danglars, and advanced towards madame de

albert, interrupting her, â€œthat i know what you were about to say.â€

â€œwell, what is it?â€

â€œif i guess rightly, will you confess it?â€

â€œyes.â€

such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our
readers, when monte cristo went one evening to pay m. danglars a visit.
m. danglars was out, but the count was asked to go and see the baroness,
and he accepted the invitation. it was never without a nervous shudder,
since the dinner at auteuil, and the events which followed it, that
madame danglars heard monte cristoâ€™s name announced. if he did not come,
the painful sensation became most intense; if, on the contrary, he
appeared, his noble countenance, his brilliant eyes, his amiability, his
polite attention even towards madame danglars, soon dispelled every
impression of fear. it appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of
such delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against
her; besides, the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would

bowed coldly to the count, and availed herself of the first moment when
the conversation became earnest to escape to her study, whence very soon
two cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional
notes of the piano assured monte cristo that mademoiselle danglars
preferred to his society and to that of m. cavalcanti the company of
mademoiselle louise dâ€™armilly, her singing teacher.

it was then, especially while conversing with madame danglars, and
apparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation, that the count
noticed m. andrea cavalcantiâ€™s solicitude, his manner of listening to
the music at the door he dared not pass, and of manifesting his
admiration. the banker soon returned. his first look was certainly
directed towards monte cristo, but the second was for andrea. as for his
wife, he bowed to her, as some husbands do to their wives, but in a way
that bachelors will never comprehend, until a very extensive code is
publishe

. monte cristo cast one
rapid and curious glance round this sanctum; it was the first time he
had ever seen mademoiselle dâ€™armilly, of whom he had heard much. â€œwell,â€
 said the banker to his daughter, â€œare we then all to be excluded?â€ he
then led the young man into the study, and either by chance or manÅ“uvre
the door was partially closed after andrea, so that from the place where
they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything; but as
the banker had accompanied andrea, madame danglars appeared to take no
notice of it.

the count soon heard andreaâ€™s voice, singing a corsican song,
accompanied by the piano. while the count smiled at hearing this song,
which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto,
madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husbandâ€™s strength
of mind, who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand
francs by a failure at milan. the praise was well deserved, for had not
the count heard it from the baroness, or by

 one of those means by which
he knew everything, the baronâ€™s countenance would not have led him to
suspect it. â€œhem,â€ thought monte cristo, â€œhe begins to conceal his
losses; a month since he boasted of them.â€ then aloud,--â€œoh, madame, m.
danglars is so skilful, he will soon regain at the bourse what he loses
elsewhere.â€

â€œi see that you participate in a prevalent error,â€ said madame danglars.
â€œwhat is it?â€ said monte cristo.

â€œthat m. danglars speculates, whereas he never does.â€

â€œtruly, madame, i recollect m. debray told me--apropos, what has become
of him? i have seen nothing of him the last three or four days.â€

â€œnor i,â€ said madame danglars; â€œbut you began a sentence, sir, and did
not finish.â€

â€œwhich?â€

â€œm. debray had told you----â€

â€œah, yes; he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of
speculation.â€

hands unknown to him.â€ madame danglars blushed, in spite of all her
efforts. â€œstay,â€ said monte cristo, as though he had not observed her
confusion, â€œi have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the
neapolitan bonds.â€

â€œi have none--nor have i ever possessed any; but really we have talked
long enough of money, count, we are like two stockbrokers; have you
heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts?â€

in the least disturbed, and returned his bow with her usual coolness.
cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed; he bowed to morcerf, who replied
with the most impertinent look possible. then albert launched out in
praise of mademoiselle danglarsâ€™ voice, and on his regret, after what he
had just heard, that he had been unable to be present the previous
evening. cavalcanti, being left alone, turned to monte cristo.

â€œcome,â€ said madame danglars, â€œleave music and compliments, and let us
go and take tea.â€

â€œcome, louise,â€ said mademoiselle danglars to her friend. they passed
into the next drawing-room, where tea was prepared. just as they were
beginning, in the english fashion, to leave the spoons in their cups,
the door again opened and danglars entered, visibly agitated. monte
cristo observed it particularly, and by a look asked the banker for an
explanation. â€œi have just received my courier from greece,â€ said
danglars.

â€œyes, i will tell you all; but take away the young man; i cannot endure
his presence.â€

â€œhe is going with me. shall i send the father to you?â€

â€œimmediately.â€

â€œvery well.â€ the count made a sign to albert and they bowed to the
ladies, and took their leave, albert perfectly indifferent to
mademoiselle danglarsâ€™ contempt, monte cristo reiterating his advice to
madame danglars on the prudence a bankerâ€™s wife should exercise in
providing for the future. m. cavalcanti remained master of the field.



chapter 77. haydÃ©e

scarcely had the countâ€™s horses cleared the angle of the boulevard, than
albert, turning towards the count, burst into a loud fit of laughter--
much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather forced
and unnatural. â€œwell,â€ said he, â€œi will ask you the same question which
charles ix. put to catherine deâ€™ medici, after the massa

â€œand what does mademoiselle dâ€™armilly say to you for robbing her of her
pupil?â€

â€œoh, well, i donâ€™t know; but i understand that she is going to italy.
madame danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the
_impresari_; i gave her a few lines for the director of the valle
theatre, who is under some obligation to me. but what is the matter,
albert? you look dull; are you, after all, unconsciously in love with
mademoiselle eugÃ©nie?â€

â€œi am not aware of it,â€ said albert, smiling sorrowfully. beauchamp
turned to look at some paintings. â€œbut,â€ continued monte cristo, â€œyou
are not in your usual spirits?â€

against the window.

â€œthe sun is not shining,â€ said morrel, more alarmed by noirtierâ€™s
expression than by valentineâ€™s indisposition. he ran towards her. the
young girl smiled. â€œcheer up,â€ said she to noirtier. â€œdo not be alarmed,
maximilian; it is nothing, and has already passed away. but listen! do i
not hear a carriage in the courtyard?â€ she opened noirtierâ€™s door, ran
to a window in the passage, and returned hastily. â€œyes,â€ said she, â€œit
is madame danglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us. good-
bye;--i must run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather,
farewell till i see you again. stay with grandpapa, maximilian; i
promise you not to persuade them to stay.â€


morrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little
staircase which led both to madame de villefortâ€™s apartments and to
hers. as soon as she was gone, noirtier made a sign to morrel to take
the dictionary. morrel obeyed; guided by valentine, h

emptied that to make a pond for his ducks.â€ noirtier raised his eyes to
heaven, as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke. from that
moment the old manâ€™s eyes were fixed on the door, and did not quit it.

it was indeed madame danglars and her daughter whom valentine had seen;
they had been ushered into madame de villefortâ€™s room, who had said she
would receive them there. that is why valentine passed through her room,
which was on a level with valentineâ€™s, and only separated from it by
edwardâ€™s. the two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of
official stiffness which preludes a formal communication. among worldly
people manner is contagious. madame de villefort received them with

â€œbut,â€ said valentine, timidly, â€œdoes all the fatherâ€™s shame revert upon
the son? monsieur albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason
charged against the general.â€

â€œexcuse me,â€ said the implacable young girl, â€œmonsieur albert claims and
well deserves his share. it appears that after having challenged m. de
monte cristo at the opera yesterday, he apologized on the ground today.â€

â€œimpossible,â€ said madame de villefort.

â€œah, my dear friend,â€ said madame danglars, with the same simplicity we
before noticed, â€œit is a fact. i heard it from m. debray, who was
present at the explanation.â€ valentine also knew the truth, but she did
not answer. a single word had reminded her that morrel was expecting her
in m. noirtierâ€™s room. deeply engaged with a sort of inward
contemplation, valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the
conversation. she would, indeed, have found it impossible to repeat what
had been said the last few minutes, when suddenly madame

 danglarsâ€™ hand,
pressed on her arm, aroused her from her lethargy.

â€œwhat is it?â€ said she, starting at madame danglarsâ€™ touch as she would
have done from an electric shock.

â€œit is, my dear valentine,â€ said the baroness, â€œthat you are, doubtless,
suffering.â€


â€œi?â€ said the young girl, passing her hand across her burning forehead.

â€œyes, look at yourself in that glass; you have turned pale and then red
successively, three or four times in one minute.â€

â€œindeed,â€ cried eugÃ©nie, â€œyou are very pale!â€

â€œoh, do not be alarmed; i have been so for many days.â€ artless as she
was, the youn

g girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave, and
besides, madame de villefort came to her assistance. â€œretire,
valentine,â€ said she; â€œyou are really suffering, and these ladies will
excuse you; drink a glass of pure water, it will restore you.â€ valentine
kissed eugÃ©nie, bowed to madame danglars, who had already risen to take
her leave, and went out. â€œthat poor child,â€ said madame de villefort
when valentine was gone, â€œshe makes me very uneasy, and i should not be
astonished if she had some serious illness.â€

meanwhile, valentine, in a sort of excitement which she could not quite
understand, had crossed edwardâ€™s room without noticing some trick of the
child, and through her own had reached the little staircase. she was
within three steps of the bottom; she already heard morre

the young man rang the bell violently; the housemaid who had been in
mademoiselle valentineâ€™s room, and the servant who had replaced barrois,
ran in at the same moment. valentine was so pale, so cold, so inanimate
that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with
the fear which pervaded that house, and they flew into the passage
crying for help. madame danglars and eugÃ©nie were going out at that
moment; they heard the cause of the disturbance.

â€œi told you so!â€ exclaimed madame de villefort. â€œpoor child!â€



chapter 94. maximilianâ€™s avowal

at the same moment m. de villefortâ€™s voice was heard calling from his
study, â€œwhat is the matter?â€ morrel looked at noirtier who had recovered
his self-command, and with a glance indicated the closet where once
before under somewhat similar circumstances, he had taken refuge. he had

this new tenant, who, as we have said, was an italian, was called il

night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that
carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the
tottering house.



chapter 95. father and daughter

we saw in a preceding chapter how madame danglars went formally to
announce to madame de villefort the approaching marriage of eugÃ©nie
danglars and m. andrea cavalcanti. this formal announcement, which
implied or appeared to imply, the approval of all the persons concerned
in this momentous affair, had been preceded by a scene to which our
readers must be admitted. we beg them to take one step backward, and to
transport themselves, the morning of that day of great catastrophes,
into the showy, gilded salon we have before shown them, and which

catastrophe which threatens you, and, which will pass over without
affecting her. she has taken care for herself,--at least i hope so,--for
her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over
me. she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love

the count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity; his
white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock
was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly
paleness of his face. his only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the
slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat. a
circle was immediately formed around the door. the count perceived at
one glance madame danglars at one end of the drawing-room, m. danglars
at the other, and eugÃ©nie in front of him. he first advanced towards the
baroness, who was chatting with madame de villefort, who had come alone,
valentine being still an invalid; and without turning aside, so clear
was the road left for him, he passed from the baroness to eugÃ©nie, whom
he complimented in such rapid and measured terms, that the proud artist
was quite struck. near her was mademoiselle louise dâ€™armilly, who
thanked the count for the

the pen, â€œis it not vexatious? an unexpected incident, in the affair of
murder and theft at the count of monte cristoâ€™s, in which he nearly fell
a victim, deprives us of the pleasure of seeing m. de villefort.â€

â€œindeed?â€ said m. danglars, in the same tone in which he would have
said, â€œoh, well, what do i care?â€

â€œas a matter of fact,â€ said monte cristo, approaching, â€œi am much afraid
that i am the involuntary cause of his absence.â€

â€œwhat, you, count?â€ said madame danglars, signing; â€œif you are, take
care, for i shall never forgive you.â€ andrea pricked up his ears.

â€œbut it is not my fault, as i shall endeavor to prove.â€ everyone
listened eagerly; monte cristo who so rarely opened his lips, was about
to speak. â€œyou remember,â€ said the count, during the most profound
silence, â€œthat the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house;
the supposition is that he was stabbÃ©d by his accomplice, on attempting
to leave it.â€

â€œyes,â€ said danglars.

could be; i alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered
man. my valet, in examining this mournful relic, felt a paper in the
pocket and drew it out; it was a letter addressed to you, baron.â€

â€œto me?â€ cried danglars.

â€œyes, indeed, to you; i succeeded in deciphering your name under the
blood with which the letter was stained,â€ replied monte cristo, amid the
general outburst of amazement.

â€œbut,â€ asked madame danglars, looking at her husband with uneasiness,
â€œhow could that prevent m. de villefort----â€

â€œin this simple way, madame,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œthe waistcoat and
the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence; i therefore
sent them to the kingâ€™s attorney. you understand, my dear baron, that
legal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was, perhaps, some
plot against you.â€ andrea looked steadily at monte cristo and

danglars to one of the floorkeepers.

but at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the
principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments,
_quÃ¦rens quem devoret_. there was, indeed, reason to retreat, to be
alarmed, and to scream. an officer was placing two soldiers at the door
of each drawing-room, and was advancing towards danglars, preceded by a
commissary of police, girded with his scarf. madame danglars uttered a
scream and fainted. danglars, who thought himself threatened (certain
consciences are never calm),--danglars even before his guests showed a
countenance of abject terror.

â€œwhat is the matter, sir?â€ asked monte cristo, advancing to meet the
commissioner.

â€œwhich of you gentlemen,â€ asked the magistrate, without replying to the
count, â€œanswers to the name of andrea cavalcanti?â€ a cry of astonishment
was heard from all parts of the room. they searched; they questioned.

staircases, by every exit, everyone hastened to retire, or rather to
fly; for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences,--which even
the best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes,--were seen
to be utterly futile. there remained in the bankerâ€™s house only
danglars, closeted in his study, and making his statement to the officer
of gendarmes; madame danglars, terrified, in the boudoir with which we
are acquainted; and eugÃ©nie, who with haughty air and disdainful lip had
retired to her room with her inseparable companion, mademoiselle louise
dâ€™armilly. as for the numerous servants (more numerous that evening than
usual, for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the cafÃ©
de paris), venting on their employers their anger at what they termed
the insult to which they had been subjected, they collected in groups in

ushed under the weight of the blow which
had struck her, had gone to seek her usual adviser, lucien debray. the
baroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her
of a guardianship which, over a girl of eugÃ©nieâ€™s character, could not
fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking; for in the tacit relations
which maintain the bond of family union, the mother, to maintain her
ascendancy over her daughter, must never fail to be a model of wisdom
and a type of perfection.

now, madame danglars feared eugÃ©nieâ€™s sagacity and the influence of
mademoiselle dâ€™armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous
expression with which her daughter looked upon debray,--an expression
which seemed to imply that she understood all her motherâ€™s amorous and
pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover, she saw
that eugÃ©nie detested debray,--not only because he was a source of
dissension and scandal under the paternal roof, but because she had at
once classed him in that

withdraw from the appellation of men, and whom diogenes designated as
animals upon two legs without feathers.

unfortunately, in this world of ours, each person views things through a
certain medium, and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as
others, and madame danglars, therefore, very much regretted that the
marriage of eugÃ©nie had not taken place, not only because the match was
good, and likely to insure the happiness of her child, but because it
would also set her at liberty. she ran therefore to debray, who, after
having like the rest of paris witnessed the contract scene and the
scandal attending it, had retired in haste to his club, where he was
chatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of
conversation for three-fourths of th

world.

at the precise time when madame danglars, dressed in black and concealed
in a long veil, was ascending the stairs leading to debrayâ€™s
apartments,--notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the
young man was not at home,--debray was occupied in repelling the
insinuations of a friend, who tried to persuade him that after the
terrible scene which had just taken place he ought, as a friend of the
family, to marry mademoiselle danglars and her two millions. debray did
not defend himself very warmly, for the idea had sometimes

crossed his
mind; still, when he recollected the independent, proud spirit of
eugÃ©nie, he positively rejected it as utterly impossible, though the
same thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in his
heart. tea, play, and the conversation, which had become interesting
during the discussion of such serious affairs, lasted till one oâ€™clock
in the morning.

meanwhile madame danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of
debray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers,
which she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed, debray
had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was
half excused in the eyes of the poor woman.

at twenty minutes to twelve, madame danglars, tired of waiting, returned
home. women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one
respect, they seldom return home after twelve oâ€™cloc

terrible excitement of the evening, and had gone to bed and to sleep.
she called the maid and questioned her.

â€œmademoiselle eugÃ©nie,â€ said the maid, â€œretired to her apartment with
mademoiselle dâ€™armilly; they then took tea together, after which they
desired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer.â€ since then
the maid had been below, and like everyone else she thought the young
ladies were in their own room; madame danglars, therefore, went to bed
without a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the recent events.
in proportion as her memory became clearer, the occurrences of the
evening were revealed in their true light; what she had taken for
confusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as something distressing,
was in reality a disgrace. and then the baroness remembered that she had
felt no pity for poor mercÃ©dÃ¨s, who had been afflicted with as severe a
blow through her husband and son.

s house. for the last month this wretched house had
presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the plague.
some of the apartments were closed within and without; the shutters were
only opened to admit a minuteâ€™s air, showing the scared face of a
footman, and immediately afterwards the window would be closed, like a
gravestone falling on a sepulchre, and the neighbors would say to each
other in a low voice, â€œwill there be another funeral today at the
procureurâ€™s house?â€ madame danglars involuntarily shuddered at the
desolate aspect of the mansion; descending from the cab, she approached
the door with trembling knees, and rang the bell. three times did the
bell ring with a dull, heavy sound, seeming to participate, in the
general sadness, before the concierge appeared and peeped through the
door, which he opened just wide enough to allow his words to be heard.
he saw a lady, a fashionable, elegantly dressed lady, and yet the door
remained almost closed.

â€œmadame, this is precaution, not impertinence; no one enters here

â€œwell, i have business with the procureur.â€

â€œis it pressing business?â€

â€œyou can imagine so, since i have not even brought my carriage out yet.
but enough of this--here is my card, take it to your master.â€

â€œmadame will await my return?â€

â€œyes; go.â€ the concierge closed the door, leaving madame danglars in the
street. she had not long to wait; directly afterwards the door was
opened wide enough to admit her, and when she had passed through, it was
again shut. without losing sight of her for an instant, the concierge
took a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court, and
blew it. the valet de chambre appeared on the door-steps. â€œyou will
excuse this poor fellow, madame,â€ he said, as he preceded the baroness,
â€œbut his orders are precise, and m. de villefort begged me to tell

that he could not act otherwise.â€

in the court showing his merchandise, was a tradesman who had been
admitted with the same precautions. the baroness ascended the steps; she
felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify
her own, and still guided by the valet de chambre, who never lost sight
of her for an instant, she was introduced to the magistrateâ€™s study.
preoccupied as madame danglars had been with the object of her visit,
the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so
insulting, that she began by complaining of it. but villefort, raising
his head, bowed down by grief, looked up at her with so sad a smile that
her complaints died upon her lips. â€œforgive my servants,â€ he said, â€œfor
a terror i cannot blame them for; from being suspected they have become
suspicious.â€

madame danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate
alluded,

â€œyou mean a mischance.â€

â€œa mischance?â€ repeated the baroness.

â€œalas, madame,â€ said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of
manner, â€œi consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable.â€

â€œand do you suppose this will be forgotten?â€

â€œeverything will be forgotten, madame,â€ said villefort. â€œyour daughter
will be married tomorrow, if not today--in a week, if not tomorrow; and
i do not think you can regret the intended husband of your daughter.â€

madame danglars gazed on villefort, stupefied to find him so almost
insultingly calm. â€œam i come to a friend?â€ she asked in a tone full of
mournful dignity. â€œyou know that you are, madame,â€ said villefort, whose
pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance. and
truly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now
occupying the baroness and him. â€œwell, then, be more affectionate, my
dear villefort,â€ said the baroness. â€œspeak to me not as a magistrate,
but as

œah,â€ exclaimed the baroness, without expressing the ideas which the
exclamation betrayed. villefort looked at her with that piercing glance
which reads the secrets of the heart.

â€œyes, i know what you mean,â€ he said; â€œyou refer to the terrible rumors
spread abroad in the world, that the deaths which have kept me in
mourning for the last three months, and from which valentine has only
escaped by a miracle, have not happened by natural means.â€

â€œi was not thinking of that,â€ replied madame danglars quickly.

â€œyes, you were thinking of it, and with justice. you could not help
thinking of it, and saying to yourself, â€˜you, who pursue crime so
vindictively, answer now, why are there unpunished crimes in your
dwelling?â€™â€ the baroness became pale. â€œyou were saying this, were you
not?â€

â€œwell, i own it.â€

â€œi will answer you.â€

villefort drew his armchair nearer to madame danglars; then resting both
hands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual: â€œthere

proof of human perversity or error. every criminal i condemn seems to me
living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the rest. alas,
alas, alas; all the world is wicked; let us therefore strike at
wickedness!â€

villefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage, which gave a
ferocious eloquence to his words.

â€œbutâ€â€™ said madame danglars, resolving to make a last effort, â€œthis
young man, though a murderer, is an orphan, abandoned by everybody.â€

â€œso much the worse, or rather, so much the better; it has been so
ordained that he may have none to weep his fate.â€

â€œbut this is trampling on the weak, sir.â€

â€œthe weakness of a murderer!â€

â€œhis dishonor reflects upon us.â€

employed, and at this very minute----â€

â€œsir,â€ said the valet de chambre, entering the room, â€œa dragoon has
brought this despatch from the minister of the interior.â€ villefort
seized the letter, and hastily broke the seal. madame danglars trembled
with fear; villefort started with joy.

â€œarrested!â€ he exclaimed; â€œhe was taken at compiÃ¨gne, and all is over.â€

madame danglars rose from her seat, pale and cold.

â€œadieu, sir,â€ she said.

â€œadieu, madame,â€ replied the kingâ€™s attorney, as in an almost joyful
manner he conducted her to the door. then, turning to his desk, he said,

as the procureur had told madame danglars, valentine was not yet

and it was in her own room, and from the lips of madame de villefort,
that she heard all the strange events we have related,--we mean the
flight of eugÃ©nie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti, or rather

him. but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the

â€œthe truth, my dear count. oh, how happy you must be in not having
either wife or children!â€

â€œdo you think so?â€

â€œindeed i do.â€

â€œand so mademoiselle danglars----â€

â€œshe could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch, so she
asked permission to travel.â€

â€œand is she gone?â€

â€œthe other night she left.â€

â€œwith madame danglars?â€

â€œno, with a relation. but still, we have quite lost our dear eugÃ©nie;
for i doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to france.â€

â€œstill, baron,â€ said monte cristo, â€œfamily griefs, or indeed any other
affliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure,

the baroness had watched debray while he read this long and painful
letter, and saw him, notwithstanding his self-control, change color once
or twice. when he had ended the perusal, he folded the letter and
resumed his pensive attitude. â€œwell?â€ asked madame danglars, with an
anxiety easy to be understood.

â€œwell, madame?â€ unhesitatingly repeated debray.

â€œwith what ideas does that letter inspire you?â€

â€œoh, it is simple enough, madame; it inspires me with the idea that m.
danglars has left suspiciously.â€

â€œcertainly; but is this all you have to say to me?â€

â€œi do not understand you,â€ said debray with freezing coldness.

â€œhe is gone! gone, never to return!â€

â€œoh, madame, do not think that!â€

â€œi tell you he will never return. i

know his character; he is inflexible
in any resolutions formed for his own interests. if he could have made
any use of me, he would have taken me with him; he leaves me in paris,
as our separation will conduce to his benefit;--therefore he has gone,
and i am free forever,â€ added madame danglars, in the same supplicating
tone. debray, instead of answering, allowed her to remain in an attitude
of nervous inquiry. â€œwell?â€ she said at length, â€œdo you not answer me?â€

â€œi have but one question to ask you,--what do you intend to do?â€

â€œi was going to ask you,â€ replied the baroness with a beating heart.

â€œah, then, you wish to ask advice of me?â€

â€œyes; i do wish to ask your advice,â€ said madame danglars with anxious
expectation.

â€œthen if you wish to take my advice,â

pale and motionless baroness listened to this, was equalled by the calm
indifference with which debray had spoken. â€œdeserted?â€ she repeated;
â€œah, yes, i am, indeed, deserted! you are right, sir, and no one can
doubt my position.â€ these were the only words that this proud and
violently enamoured woman could utter in response to debray.


â€œbut then you are rich,--very rich, indeed,â€ continued debray, taking
out some papers from his pocket-book, which he spread upon the table.
madame danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the
beatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to
gush forth. at length a sense of dignity prevailed, and if she did not
entirely master her agitation, she at least succeeded in preventing the
fall of a single tear. â€œmadame,â€ said debray, â€œit is nearly six months
since we have been associated. you furnished a principal of 100,000
francs. our partnership began in the month of april. in may we commenced
operations, and in

cealed under that closet, and for
greater security i myself concealed it there.

â€œnow, madame,â€ continued debray, first opening the closet, then the
chest;--â€œnow, madame, here are 800 notes of 1,000 francs each,
resembling, as you see, a large book bound in iron; to this i add a
certificate in the funds of 25,000 francs; then, for the odd cash,
making i think about 110,000 francs, here is a check upon my banker,
who, not being m. danglars, will pay you the amount, you may rest
assured.â€ madame danglars mechanically took the check, the bond, and the
heap of bank-notes. this enormous fortune made no great appearance on
the table. madame danglars, with tearless eyes, but with her breast
heaving with concealed emotion, placed the bank-notes in her bag, put
the certificate and check into her pocket-book, and then, standing pale
and mute, awaited one kind word of consolation. but she waited in vain.

â€œnow, madame,â€ said debray, â€œyou have a splendid fortune, an income of
about 60,000 livres a

insufficient, you can, for the sake of the past, madame, make use of
mine; and i am ready to offer you all i possess, on loan.â€

â€œthank you, sir--thank you,â€ replied the baroness; â€œyou forget that what
you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires, who
intends for some time, at least, to retire from the world.â€

debray was, for a moment, surprised, but immediately recovering himself,
he bowed with an air which seemed to say, â€œas you please, madame.â€

madame danglars had until then, perhaps, hoped for something; but when
she saw the careless bow of debray, and the glance by which it was
accompanied, together with his significant silence, she raised her head,
and without passion or violence or even hesitation, ran downstairs,
disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from
her. â€œbah,â€ said debray, when she had left, â€œthese are fine projects!
she will remain at home, read novels, and speculate at cards, since she
can no longer do s

cancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had
just paid away. â€œi have 1,060,000 francs remaining,â€ he said. â€œwhat a
pity mademoiselle de villefort is dead! she suited me in every respect,
and i would have married her.â€ and he calmly waited until the twenty
minutes had elapsed after madame danglarsâ€™ departure before he left the
house. during this time he occupied himself in making figures, with his
watch by his side.

changed within the last few days; not that even in her days of fortune

had been a conservatory of costly exotics. but she had her son. hitherto
the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them. excitement, like
enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth. but
the excitement had calmed down, and they felt themselves obliged to
descend from dreams to reality; after having exhausted the ideal, they
found they must talk of the actual.

â€œmother,â€ exclaimed albert, just as madame danglars was descending the
stairs, â€œlet us reckon our riches, if you please; i want capital to
build my plans upon.â€

â€œcapital--nothing!â€ replied mercÃ©dÃ¨s with a mournful smile.

â€œno, mother,--capital 3,000 francs. and i have an idea of our leading a
delightful life upon this 3,000 francs.â€

tried to make it remain.

â€œmy dear sir,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œallow me to tell you that you do

give him a lesson, debray.â€

â€œstay,â€ said beauchamp, â€œsurely i am not deceived.â€

â€œwhat is it?â€

â€œit is she!â€

â€œwhom do you mean?â€

â€œthey said she had left.â€

â€œmademoiselle eugÃ©nie?â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œhas she returned?â€

â€œno, but her mother.â€

â€œmadame danglars? nonsense! impossible!â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œonly ten
days after the flight of her daughter, and three days from the
bankruptcy of her husband?â€

debray colored slightly, and followed with his eyes the direction of
beauchampâ€™s glance. â€œcome,â€ he said, â€œit is only a veiled lady, some
foreign princess, perhaps the mother of cavalcanti. but you were just
speaking on a very interesting topic, beauchamp.â€

â€œi?â€

â€œyes; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of valen

â€œbut your mother?â€ asked the president.

â€œmy mother thought me dead; she is not guilty. i did not even wish to
know her name, nor do i know it.â€ just then a piercing cry, ending in a
sob, burst from the centre of the crowd, who encircled the lady who had
before fainted, and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics. she
was carried out of the hall, the thick veil which concealed her face
dropped off, and madame danglars was recognized. notwithstanding his
shattered nerves, the ringing sensation in his ears, and the madness
which turned his brain, villefort rose as he perceived her.

â€œthe proofs, the proofs!â€ said the president; â€œremember this tissue of
horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs.â€

â€œthe proofs?â€ said benedetto, laughing; â€œdo you want proofs?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwell, then, look at m. de villefort, and then ask me for proofs.â€
