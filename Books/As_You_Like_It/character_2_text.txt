  duke senior. now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
    hath not old custom made this life more sweet
    than that of painted pomp? are not these woods
    more free from peril than the envious court?
    here feel we not the penalty of adam,
    the seasons' difference; as the icy fang
    and churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
    which when it bites and blows upon my body,
    even till i shrink with cold, i smile and say

    sweet are the uses of adversity,
    which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
    wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
    and this our life, exempt from public haunt,
    finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
    sermons in stones, and good in everything.
    i would not change it.

  amiens. happy is your grace,
    that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
    into so quiet and so sweet a style.

  duke senior. come, shall we go and kill us venison?
    and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
    being native burghers of this desert city,
    should, in their own confines, with forked heads
    have their round haunches gor'd.

  first lord. indeed, my lord,
    the melancholy jaques grieves at that;
    and, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
    than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.

    that from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
    did come to languish; and, indeed, my lord,
    the wretched animal heav'd forth such groans
    that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
    almost to bursting; and the big round tears
    cours'd one another down his innocent nose
    in piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
    much marked of the melancholy jaques,
    stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,
    augmenting it with tears.

  duke senior. but what said jaques?
    did he not moralize this spectacle?

  first lord. o, yes, into a thousand similes.
    first, for his weeping into the needless stream:
    'poor deer,' quoth he 'thou mak'st a testament
    as worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
    to that which had too much.' then, being there alone,
    left and abandoned of his velvet friends:
    ''tis right'; quoth he 'thus misery doth part
    the flux of company.' anon, a careless herd,
    full of the pasture,

    and never stays to greet him. 'ay,' quoth jaques
    'sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
    'tis just the fashion. wherefore do you look
    upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
    thus most invectively he pierceth through
    the body of the country, city, court,
    yea, and of this our life; swearing that we
    are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
    to fright the animals, and to kill them up
    in their assign'd and native dwelling-place.

  duke senior. and did you leave him in this contemplation?

  second lord. we did, my lord, weeping and commenting
    upon the sobbing deer.

  duke senior. show me the place;
    i love to cope him in these sullen fits,
    for then he's full of matter.

    that your poor friends must woo your company?
    what, you look merrily!

  jaques. a fool, a fool! i met a fool i' th' forest,
    a motley fool. a miserable world!
    as i do live by food, i met a fool,
    who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
    and rail'd on lady fortune in good terms,
    in good set terms- and yet a motley fool.

    and after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
    and so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
    and then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
    and thereby hangs a tale.' when i did hear
    the motley fool thus moral on the time,
    my lungs began to crow like chanticleer
    that fools should be so deep contemplative;
    and i did laugh sans intermission
    an hour by his dial. o noble fool!
    a worthy fool! motley's the only wear.

  duke senior. what fool is this?

  jaques. o worthy fool! one that hath been a courtier,
    and says, if ladies be but young and fair,
    they have the gift to know it; and in his brain,
    which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
    after a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
    with observation, the which he vents
    in mangled forms. o that i were a fool!
    i am ambitious for a motley coat.

 and why, sir, must they so?
    the why is plain as way to parish church:
    he that a fool doth very wisely hit
    doth very foolishly, although he smart,
    not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,
    the wise man's folly is anatomiz'd
    even by the squand'ring glances of the fool.
    invest me in my motley; give me leave
    to speak my mind, and i will through and through
    cleanse the foul body of th' infected world,
    if they will patiently receive my medicine.

  duke senior. fie on thee! i can tell what thou wouldst do.

  jaques. what, for a counter, would i do but good?

  duke senior. most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin;
    for thou thyself hast been a libertine,
    as sensual as the brutish sting itself;
    and all th' embossed sores and headed evils
    that thou with license of free foot hast caught
    wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.

  duke senior. true is it that we have seen better days,
    and have with holy bell been knoll'd to church,
    and sat at good men's feasts, and wip'd our eyes
    of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red;
    and therefore sit you down in gentleness,
    and take upon command what help we have
    that to your wanting may be minist'red.
