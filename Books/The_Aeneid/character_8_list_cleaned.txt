[CHARACTER] - 
                    latinus's
daughter and a symbol of latium in general. [CHARACTER]'s character
is not developed in the poem; she is important only as the object
of the trojan-latin struggle. the question of who will marry [CHARACTER]--turnus
or aeneas--becomes key to future relations between the latins and
the trojans and therefore the aeneid's entire historical
scheme.
