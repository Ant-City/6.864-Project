d round me with fear and trembling, dreading to see some one who would recognize me. i was rejoiced to find that we were to stay but a short time.

        we soon returned to new york, to make arrangements for spending the remainder of the summer at rockaway. while the laundress was putting the clothes in order, i took an opportunity to go over to brooklyn to see ellen. i met her going to a grocery store, and the first words she said, were, "o, mother, don't go to mrs. hobbs's. her brother, mr. thorne, has come from the south, and may be he'll tell where you are." i accepted the warning. i told her i was going away with mrs. bruce the next day, and would try to see her when i came back.

        being in servitude to the anglo-saxon race, i was not put into a "jim crow car," on our way to rockaway, neither was i invited to ride through the streets on the top of trunks in a truck; but every where i found the same manifestations of that cruel prejudice, which so discourages the feelings, and r

ed down stairs; for i supposed mrs. hobbs's southern brother might still be there, and i was desirous to avoid seeing him, if possible. but mrs. hobbs came to the kitchen, and insisted on my going up stairs. "my brother wants to see you," said she, "and he is sorry you seem to shun him. he knows you are living in new york. he told me to say to you that he owes thanks to good old aunt martha for too many little acts of kindness for him to be base enough to betray her grandchild."
        this mr. thorne had become poor and reckless long before he left the south, and such persons had much rather go to one of the faithful old slaves to borrow a dollar, or get a good dinner, than to go to one whom they consider an equal. it was such acts of kindness as these for which he professed to feel grateful to my grandmother. i wished he had kept at a distance, but as he was here, and knew where i was, i concluded there was nothing to be gained by trying to avoid him; on the contrary, it might be the means

 mother's observing eye easily perceived that she was not happy. on the occasion of one of my visits i found her unusually serious. when i asked her what was the matter, she said nothing was the matter. but i insisted upon knowing what made her look so very grave. finally, i ascertained that she felt troubled about the dissipation that was continually going on in the house. she was sent to the store very often for rum and brandy, and she felt ashamed to ask for it so often, and mr. hobbs and mr. thorne drank a great deal, and their hands trembled so that they had to call her to pour out the liquor for them. "but for all that," said she, "mr. hobbs is good to me, and i can't help liking him. i feel sorry for him." i tried to comfort her, by telling her that i had laid up a hundred dollars, and that before long i hoped to be able to give her and benjamin a home, and send them to school. she was always desirous not to add to my troubles more than she could help, and i did not discover till years

 afterwards that mr. thorne's intemperance was not the only annoyance she suffered from him. though he professed too much gratitude to my grandmother to injure any of her descendants, he had poured vile language into the ears of her innocent great-grandchild.

        i usually went to brooklyn to spend sunday afternoon. one sunday, i found ellen anxiously waiting for me near the house. "o, mother," said she, "i've

been waiting for you this long time. i'm afraid mr. thorne has written to tell dr. flint where you are. make haste and come in. mrs. hobbs will tell you all about it!"

        the story was soon told. while the children were playing in the grape-vine arbor, the day before, mr. thorne came out with a letter in his hand, which he tore up and scattered about. ellen was sweeping the yard at the time, and having her mind full of suspicions of him, she picked up the pieces and carried them to the children, saying, "i wonder who mr. thorne has been writing t

n't know, and don't care," replied the oldest of the children; "and i don't see how it concerns you."

        "but it does concern me," replied ellen; "for i'm afraid he's been writing to the south about my mother."

        they laughed at her, and called her a silly thing, but good-naturedly put the fragments of writing together, in order to read them to her. they were no sooner arranged, than the little girl exclaimed, "i declare, ellen, i believe you are right."

        the contents of mr. thorne's letter, as nearly as i can remember, were as follows: "i have seen your slave, linda, and conversed with her. she can be taken very easily, if you manage prudently. there are enough of us here to swear to her identity as your property. i am a patriot, a lover of my country, and i do this as an act of justice to the laws." he concluded by informing the doctor of the street and number where i lived. the children carried the pieces to mrs. hobbs, who immediately went to her brother's
