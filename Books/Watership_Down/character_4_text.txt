them tough and
cunning. any hlessil they find they pick up and bring back to efrafa. if they won't
come, they kill them. they reckon hlessil a danger, because they may attract the
attention of men. the wide patrols report back to general woundwort, and the
council decide what to do about anything new that they think may be dangerous."
     "they missed you on the way in, then?" said bluebell.
     "oh, no, they didn't! we learned later that some time after we'd been brought
in by this rabbit -- captain campion -- a runner arrived from a wide patrol to say
that they'd picked up the track of three or four rabbits coming toward efrafa from
the north, and were there any orders? he was sent back to say that we were safely
under control.
     "anyway, this captain campion took us down to a hole in the ditch. the mouth
of the hole was a bit of old earthenware pipe and if a man had pulled it out, the
opening would have fallen in and showed no trace of the run inside. and there he
handed us over to another ca

 upset and demoralized the owsla a good deal.
     other patrols had been sent out at once, but all that they had established was
that the rabbits from the north had crossed the iron road and disappeared
southward. it was intolerable that they should have passed so close to efrafa and
gone their way without being apprehended. even now they might possibly be
caught, if only there were a really enterprising officer to put in charge of the
search. it would certainly need an enterprising officer -- captain campion
perhaps -- for patrols seldom crossed the iron road, and the wet country beyond
-- the country near the river -- was only partly known. he would have gone
himself, but with the recent disciplinary troubles in the warren he could not take
the risk; and campion could hardly be spared just now. no -- infuriating as it
was, the strangers were best forgotten for the moment. the first thing was to
replace the owsla losses -- and preferably with rabbits who knew how to deal

id woundwort, "but they wouldn't make officers. we
need to replace charlock and mallow: that's what i'm getting at."
     "that's difficult, sir," said chervil. "that sort of rabbit doesn't hop out of the
grass."
     "well, they've got to hop from somewhere," said woundwort. "you'd better
think about it and tell me any ideas that occur to you. anyway, i want to go round
your sentries now. come with me, will you?"
     they were about to set off when a third rabbit approached -- none other than
captain campion himself. it was campion's principal duty to search the outskirts
of efrafa at morning and evening and to report anything new -- the tire marks of
a tractor in mud, the droppings of a sparrow hawk or the spreading of fertilizer on
a field. an expert tracker, he missed little or nothing and was one of the very few
rabbits for whom woundwort felt a genuine respect.
     "do you want me?" said woundwort, pausing.
     "well, i think so, sir," replied campion. "we've picked up a hlessi and brought

nch, don't you?"
     "yes, i do," said bigwig with feeling. it struck him that marjoram evidently did
not know that he himself was a newcomer to efrafa. at any rate, he showed
neither jealousy nor resentment. bigwig was beginning to realize that in this place
nobody was told more than was good for him, or got to know much except what
was before his nose. marjoram probably supposed that he, bigwig, had been
promoted out of another mark.
     as darkness fell, just before the end of the silflay, captain campion came up
the field with a patrol of three and chervil ran out to meet him on the sentry line.
bigwig joined them and listened to the talk. he gathered that campion had been
out as far as the iron road but had found nothing unusual.
     "don't you ever go beyond the iron road?" he asked.
     "not very often," answered campion. "it's wet, you know -- bad rabbit country.
i have been there, but on these ordinary circuit patrols i'm really looking nearer
home. my job is partly to notice anything ne

shall come back and deal with blackavar's guards myself. they won't be expecting
anything of the sort. i'll have him out in a moment and join you. there'll be
complete confusion and in that confusion we'll run. the bird will attack anyone
who tries to follow us. remember, we go straight down to the great arch in the
iron road. my friends will be waiting there. you've only to follow me -- i'll lead the
way."
     "captain campion may be on patrol."
     "oh, i do hope he is," said bigwig. "i really do."
     "blackavar may not run at once. he will be as startled as the guards."
     "is it possible to warn him?"
     "no. his guards never leave him and they take him out to silflay alone."
     "for how long will he have to live like that?"
     "when he has been to every mark in turn, the council will kill him. we all feel
sure of that."
     "then that settles it. i won't go without him."

say that."
     "i won't. yes, go now, and have them ready at silflay tomorrow evening, i
shan't fail you."
     when she had gone, bigwig felt desperately tired and lonely. he tried to hold
in his mind that his friends were not far off and that he would see them again in
less than a day. but he knew that all efrafa lay between himself and hazel. his
thoughts broke up into the dismal fancies of anxiety. he fell into a half-dream, in
which captain campion turned into a seagull and flew screaming over the river,
until he woke in panic: and dozed again, to see captain chervil driving blackavar
before him toward a shining wire in the grass. and over all, as big as a horse in a
field, aware of all that passed from one end of the world to the other, brooded the
gigantic figure of general woundwort. at last, worn out with his apprehensions,
he passed into a deep sleep where even his fear could not follow, and lay without
sound or movement in the solit

to the undergrowth, four big
rabbits appeared out of the long grass and sat looking down at them. one of the
does, coming up the slope a little way behind, stamped and turned to bolt. they
heard blackavar check her sharply.
     "well, why don't you answer his question, thlayli?" said one of the rabbits.
"who am i?"
     there was a pause. then hazel spoke.
     "i can see they're efrafans because they're marked," he said. "is that
woundwort?"
     "no," said blackavar, at his shoulder. "that's captain campion."
     "i see," said hazel. "well, i've heard of you, campion. i don't know whether
you mean us any harm, but the best thing you can do is to let well alone. as far as
we're concerned, our dealings with efrafa are finished."
     "you may think that," replied campion, "but you'll find it's otherwise. that doe
behind you must come with us; and so must any others that are with you."
     as he spoke, silver and acorn appeared lower down the slope, followed by
thethuthinnang. after a glance at the

was it? very well, go home. go on, hurry up. i'm waiting. that's the way -- over
there."
     the rabbit did not move. woundwort looked slowly round.
     "right," he said. "anyone else who wants to go home can get on with it. it's a
nice long way and you'll have no officers, because they'll all be busy digging,
including myself. captain vervain, captain groundsel, will you come with me?

you, thistle, go out there and fetch captain campion. and you, ragwort, get back
to the mouth of that run you had no business to leave."
     very soon the digging was resumed. the hole was deep now -- deeper than
woundwort had expected and still there was no sign of a fall. but all three rabbits
could sense that not far below them there lay a hollow space.
     "keep at it," said woundwort. "it won't take long now."
     when campion came in, he reported that he had seen three rabbits running
away over the down to the north. one appeared to be t

taggered sideways. he scrambled into the open grass and looked about him.
     "now," said woundwort, "this is the last thing we have to do, and it won't take
long. down below, there's a kind of wall." he stopped, sensing all around him
reluctance and fear. he looked at ragwort, who looked away. two other rabbits
were edging off through the grass. he called them back.
     "what do you think you're doing?" he asked.
     "nothing, sir," replied one. "we only thought that--"
     all of a sudden captain campion dashed round the corner of the hanger. from
the open down beyond came a single, high scream. at the same moment two
strange rabbits, running together, leaped the bank into the wood and disappeared
down one of the blocked tunnels.

     "run!" cried campion, stamping. "run for your lives!"
     he raced through them and was gone over the down. not knowing what he
meant or where to run, they turned one way and another. five bolted down the
opened run and a few more into the wood. but almost befo
