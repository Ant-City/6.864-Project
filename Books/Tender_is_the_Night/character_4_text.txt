on the raft, and having attained his balance was trying to

good swimmer but heâ€™s a rotten musician.â€™
â€˜yes,â€™ agreed mckisco, grudgingly. obviously he had created
his wifeâ€™s world, and allowed her few liberties in it.

to rosemary, â€˜anthiel and joyce. i donâ€™t suppose you ever

â€˜oh, did you?â€™
â€˜this is only the second season that the hotelâ€™s been open

â€˜there was mr. s. flesh,â€™ said diver, getting up also. he
took his rake and began to work seriously at getting small
stones out of the sand.
â€˜oh, yesâ€”s. fleshâ€”doesnâ€™t he give you the creeps?â€™
it was quiet alone with nicoleâ€”rosemary found it even
quieter than with her mother. abe north and barban, the
frenchman, were talking about morocco, and nicole having
copied her recipe picked up a piece of sewing. rosemary
examined their appurtenancesâ€”four large parasols that
made a canopy of shade, a portable bath house for dressing,
a pneumatic rubber horse, new things that rosemary had
never seen, from the first burst of luxury manufacturing
after the war, and probably in the hands of the first of purchasers.
she had gathered that they were fashionable people,
but though her mother

only men she had ever known, those and the heterogeneous,
indistinguishable mass of college boys, interested only in
love at first sight, whom she had met at the yale prom last
fall.
these three were different. barban was less civilized,
more skeptical and scoffing, his manners were formal, even
perfunctory. abe north had, under his shyness, a desperate
humor that amused but puzzled her. her serious nature distrusted
its ability to make a supreme impression on him.
but dick diverâ€”he was all complete there. silently she
admired him. his complexion was reddish and weatherburned,
so was his short hairâ€”a light growth of it rolled
down his arms and hands. his eyes were of a bright, hard

rosemary had a sharp feeling of disappointmentâ€”she
looked quickly at dick, as though to ask an explanation of
this incongruous mingling. but there was nothing unusual
in his expression. he greeted his new guests with a proud
bearing and an obvious deference to their infinite and
unknown possibilities. she believed in him so much that
presently she accepted the rightness of the mckiscosâ€™ presence
as if she had expected to meet them all along.
â€˜iâ€™ve met you in paris,â€™ mckisco said to abe north, who
with his wife had arrived on their heels, â€˜in fact iâ€™ve met you
twice.â€™
â€˜yes, i remember,â€™ abe said.
â€˜then where was it?â€™ demanded mckisco, not content to
let well enough alone.
â€˜why, i thinkâ€”â€˜ abe got tired of the game, â€˜i canâ€™t remember.â€™
the interchange filled a pause and rosemaryâ€™s instinct

was that something tactful should be said by somebody, but
dick made no attempt to break up the grouping formed by
these late arrivals

in a pause rosemary looked away and up the table where
nicole sat between tommy barban and abe north, her
chowâ€™s hair foaming and frothing in the candlelight. rosemary
listened, caught sharply by the rich clipped voice in
infrequent speech:
â€˜the poor man,â€™ nicole exclaimed. â€˜why did you want to
saw him in two?â€™
â€˜naturally i wanted to see what was inside a waiter.
wouldnâ€™t you like to know what was inside a waiter?â€™
â€˜old menus,â€™ suggested nicole with a short laugh. â€˜pieces
of broken china and tips and pencil stubs.â€™
â€˜exactlyâ€”but the thing was to prove it scientifical

then barban talking to her mother with an urbane fluency
that made rosemary like him again. then nicole.
rosemary saw her suddenly in a new way and found her one
of the most beautiful people she had ever known. her face,
the face of a saint, a viking madonna, shone through the
faint motes that snowed across the candlelight, drew down
its flush from the wine-colored lanterns in the pine. she was
still as still.
abe north was talking to her about his moral code: â€˜of
course iâ€™ve got one,â€™ he insisted, â€˜â€”a man canâ€™t live without
a moral code. mine is that iâ€™m against the burning of
witches. whenever they burn a witch i get all hot under the
collar.â€™ rosemary knew from brady that he was a musician
who after a brilliant and precocious start had composed
nothing for seven years.
next was campion, managing somehow to restrain his
most blatant effeminacy, and even to visit upon those near
him a certain

â€˜so since things are over down hereâ€”â€˜
â€˜over?â€™ she inquired.
â€˜well, this is overâ€”this part of the summer is over. last
week nicoleâ€™s sister left, to-morrow tommy barban leaves,
monday abe and mary north are leaving. maybe weâ€™ll have
more fun this summer but this particular fun is over. i want
it to die violently instead of fading out sentimentallyâ€”thatâ€™s
why i gave this party. what iâ€™m coming to isâ€”nicole and
i are going up to paris to see abe north off for americaâ€”i
wonder if youâ€™d like to go with us.â€™
â€˜what did mother say?â€™
â€˜she seemed to think it would be fine. she doesnâ€™t want to
go herself. she wants you to go alone.â€™
â€˜i havenâ€™t seen paris since iâ€™ve been grown,â€™ said rosemary.
â€˜iâ€™d love to see it with you.â€™
â€˜thatâ€™s nice of you.â€™ did she imagine that his voice was
suddenly metallic? â€˜of course weâ€™ve been excited about you

his face was repulsive in the quickening light. not by a
flicker of her personality, a movement of the smallest muscle,
did she betray her sudden disgust with whatever it was.
but campionâ€™s sensitivity realized it and he changed the 
62 tender is the night
subject rather suddenly.
â€˜abe north is around here somewhere.â€™
â€˜why, heâ€™s staying at the diversâ€™!â€™
â€˜yes, but heâ€™s upâ€”donâ€™t you know what happened?â€™
a shutter opened suddenly in a room two stories above
and an english voice spat distinctly:
â€˜will you kaindlay stup tucking!â€™
rosemary and luis campion went humbly down the
steps and to a bench beside the road to the beach.
â€˜then you have no idea whatâ€™s happened? my dear, the
most extraordinary thingâ€”â€˜ he was warming up now,
hanging on to his revelation

thinking of his own griefs. â€˜i almost wish it were i. i might

and rocked to and fro with sorrow.
again the iron shutter parted above and the same british
voice said:
â€˜rilly, this must stup immejetely.â€™
simultaneously abe north, looking somewhat distracted,
came out of the hotel, perceived them against the sky,
white over the sea. rosemary shook her head warningly before
he could speak and they moved another bench further
down the road. rosemary saw that abe was a little tight.
â€˜what are you doing up?â€™ he demanded.
â€˜i just got up.â€™ she started to laugh, but remembering the
voice above, she restrained herself.

a periscope, looked through it a moment; then he got up
on the step and peered over the parapet. in front of him
beneath a dingy sky was beaumont hamel; to his left the
tragic hill of thiepval. dick stared at them through his field
glasses, his throat straining with sadness.
he went on along the trench, and found the others waiting
for him in the next traverse. he was full of excitement
and he wanted to communicate it to them, to make them
understand about this, though actually abe north had seen
battle service and he had not.
â€˜this land here cost twenty lives a foot that summer,â€™ he
said to rosemary. she looked out obediently at the rather
bare green plain with its low trees of six yearsâ€™ growth. if
dick had added that they were now being shelled she would
have believed him that afternoon. her love had reached a
point where now at last she was beginning to be unhappy,
to be desperate. she didnâ€™t know what to doâ€”she wanted to
talk to her mother.

on sundays sometimes when rosemary and her mother
had lived in paris they had taken the little steamer up to
suresnes and talked about plans for the future. they had little
money but mrs. speers was so sure of rosemaryâ€™s beauty
and had implanted in her so much ambition, that she was
willing to gamble the money on â€˜advantagesâ€; rosemary in
turn was to repay her mother when she got her start... .
since reaching paris abe north had had a thin vinous
fur over him; his eyes were bloodshot from sun and wine.
rosemary realized for the first time that he was always stopping
in places to get a drink, and she wondered how mary
north liked it. mary was quiet, so quiet save for her frequent
laughter that rosemary had learned little about her.

abe north was still in the ritz bar, where he had been
since nine in the morning. when he arrived seeking sanctuary
the windows were open and great beams were busy
at pulling up the dust from smoky carpets and cushions.
chasseurs tore through the corridors, liberated and disembodied,
moving for the moment in pure space. the sit-down
bar for women, across from the bar proper, seemed very
smallâ€”it was hard to imagine what throngs it could accommodate
in the afternoon.

the irregularly shaped pieces that may do some timeâ€”this
fact might account for what rosemary afterward mystically
described as â€˜realizingâ€™ that there was some one in the room,
before she could determine it. but when she did realize it
she turned swift in a sort of ballet step and saw that a dead
negro was stretched upon her bed.
as she cried â€˜aaouu!â€™ and her still unfastened wristwatch
banged against the desk she had the preposterous idea that
it was abe north. then she dashed for the door and across
the hall.
dick was straightening up; he had examined the gloves
worn that day and thrown them into a pile of soiled gloves
in a corner of a trunk. he had hung up coat and vest and
spread his shirt on another hangerâ€”a trick of his own.
â€˜youâ€™ll wear a shirt thatâ€™s a little dirty where you wonâ€™t wear
a mussed shirt.â€™ nicole had come in and was dumping one
of abeâ€™s extraordinary ash-trays into the waste-basket when
rosemary tore into the room.

enough to store awayâ€”realizing that the totality of a life may
be different in quality from its segments, and also that life
during the forties seemed capable of being observed only in
segments. his love for nicole and rosemary, his friendship
with abe north, with tommy barban in the broken universe
of the warâ€™s endingâ€”in such contacts the personalities
had seemed to press up so close to him that he became the
personality itselfâ€”there seemed some necessity of taking
all or nothing; it was as if for the remainder of his life he
was condemned to carry with him the egos of certain people,
