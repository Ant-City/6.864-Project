[CHARACTER] - 
                	[CHARACTER]
is a philosopher and candide's tutor. his optimistic belief that
this world is "the best of all possible worlds" is the primary target
of the novel's satire. [CHARACTER]'s own experiences contradict this belief,
but he remains faithful to it nonetheless. like candide, [CHARACTER]
is not a three-dimensional character. instead, he is an exaggerated
parody of overly optimistic enlightenment philosophers.
