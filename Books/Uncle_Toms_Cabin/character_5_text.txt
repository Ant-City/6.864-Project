kind, and in almost every case with a personal appearance prepossessing
and agreeable. eliza, such as we have described her, is not a fancy
sketch, but taken from remembrance, as we saw her, years ago, in
kentucky. safe under the protecting care of her mistress, eliza had
reached maturity without those temptations which make beauty so fatal
an inheritance to a slave. she had been married to a bright and talented
young mulatto man, who was a slave on a neighboring estate, and bore the
name of george harris.

this young man had been hired out by his master to work in a bagging
factory, where his adroitness and ingenuity caused him to be considered
the first hand in the place. he had invented a machine for the cleaning
of the hemp, which, considering the education and circumstances of
the inventor, displayed quite as much mechanical genius as whitney’s
cotton-gin.*

     *  a machine of this description was really the invention of
     a young colored man in kentucky. [mrs. stowe’s note.]

“what does thee want, father?” said rachel, rubbing her floury hands, as
she went into the porch.

“this child’s husband is in the settlement, and will be here tonight,”
 said simeon.

“now, thee doesn’t say that, father?” said rachel, all her face radiant
with joy.

“it’s really true. peter was down yesterday, with the wagon, to the
other stand, and there he found an old woman and two men; and one said
his name was george harris; and from what he told of his history, i am
certain who he is. he is a bright, likely fellow, too.”

“shall we tell her now?” said simeon.

“let’s tell ruth,” said rachel. “here, ruth,--come here.”

ruth laid down her knitting-work, and was in the back porch in a moment.

“ruth, what does thee think?” said rachel. “father says eliza’s husband
is in the last company, and will be here tonight.”

a burst of joy from the little quakeress interrupted the speech. she

 and niggers _do_ fight like the devil, sometimes.”

at this moment, george appeared on the top of a rock above them, and,
speaking in a calm, clear voice, said,

“gentlemen, who are you, down there, and what do you want?”

“we want a party of runaway niggers,” said tom loker. “one george
harris, and eliza harris, and their son, and jim selden, and an old
woman. we’ve got the officers, here, and a warrant to take ‘em; and
we’re going to have ‘em, too. d’ye hear? an’t you george harris, that
belongs to mr. harris, of shelby county, kentucky?”

“i am george harris. a mr. harris, of kentucky, did call me his
property. but now i’m a free man, standing on god’s free soil; and my
wife and my child i claim as mine. jim and his mother are here. we have
arms to defend ourselves, and we mean to do it. you can come up, if
you like; but the first one of you that comes within the range of our
bullets is a dead man, and the next, and the next; and so on till the
last.”

your heart’s blood thrill at that word, for which your fathers bled, and
your braver mothers were willing that their noblest and best should die?

is there anything in it glorious and dear for a nation, that is not also
glorious and dear for a man? what is freedom to a nation, but freedom
to the individuals in it? what is freedom to that young man, who sits
there, with his arms folded over his broad chest, the tint of african
blood in his cheek, its dark fires in his eyes,--what is freedom to
george harris? to your fathers, freedom was the right of a nation to be
a nation. to him, it is the right of a man to be a man, and not a brute;
the right to call the wife of his bosom his wife, and to protect her from
lawless violence; the right to protect and educate his child; the right
to have a home of his own, a religion of his own, a character of his
own, unsubject to the will of another. all these thoughts were rolling
and seething in george’s breast, as he was pensively leaning his head

place,” said george. “we never have had much intercourse with him,
though.”

“he is a large slave-owner, i believe,” said madame de thoux, with a
manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing
to show.

“he is,” said george, looking rather surprised at her manner.

“did you ever know of his having--perhaps, you may have heard of his
having a mulatto boy, named george?”

“o, certainly,--george harris,--i know him well; he married a servant of
my mother’s, but has escaped, now, to canada.”

“he has?” said madame de thoux, quickly. “thank god!”

george looked a surprised inquiry, but said nothing.

madame de thoux leaned her head on her hand, and burst into tears.

“he is my brother,” she said.

“madame!” said george, with a strong accent of surprise.

“yes,” said madame de thoux, lifting her head, proudly, and wiping her
tears, “mr. shelby, george harris is my broth

george, with his wife, children, sister and mother, embarked for africa,
some few weeks after. if we are not mistaken, the world will yet hear
from him there.

of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write, except
a word relating to miss ophelia and topsy, and a farewell chapter, which
we shall dedicate to george shelby.

miss ophelia took topsy home to vermont with her, much to the surprise
of the grave deliberative body whom a new englander recognizes under
