t atticus down. atticus so rarely asked jem
and me to do something for him, i could take being called a coward for him. i felt
extremely noble for having remembered, and remained noble for three weeks.
then christmas came and disaster struck.

jem and i viewed christmas with mixed feelings. the good side was the tree and
uncle jack finch. every christmas eve day we met uncle jack at maycomb
junction, and he would spend a week with us.
a flip of the coin revealed the uncompromising lineaments of aunt alexandra
and francis.
i suppose i should include uncle jimmy, aunt alexandraâ€™s husband, but as he
never spoke a word to me in my life except to say, â€œget off the fence,â€ once, i
never saw any reason to take notice of him. neither did aunt alexandra. long
ago, in a burst of friendliness, aunty and uncle jimmy produced a son named
henry, who left home as soon as was humanly possible, married, and produced
francis. henry and his wife deposited francis at his grandparentsâ€™ every
christmas, then purs

ued their own pleasures.
no amount of sighing could induce atticus to let us spend christmas day at home.
we went to finchâ€™s landing every christmas in my memory. the fact that aunty
was a good cook was some compensation for being forced to spend a religious

holiday with francis hancock. he was a year older than i, and i avoided him on
principle: he enjoyed everything i disapproved of, and disliked my ingenuous
diversions.
aunt alexandra was atticusâ€™s sister, but when jem told me about changelings and
siblings, i decided that she had been swapped at birth, that my grandparents had
perhaps received a crawford instead of a finch. had i ever harbored the mystical
notions about mountains that seem to obsess lawyers and judges, aunt alexandra
would have been analogous to mount everest: throughout my early life, she was
cold and there.
when uncle jack jumped down from the train christmas eve day, we had to wait
for the porter to ha

nd him two long packages. jem and i always thought it funny
when uncle jack pecked atticus on the cheek; they were the only two men we
ever saw kiss each other. uncle jack shook hands with jem and swung me high,
but not high enough: uncle jack was a head shorter than atticus; the baby of the
family, he was younger than aunt alexandra. he and aunty looked alike, but
uncle jack made better use of his face: we were never wary of his sharp nose and
chin.
he was one of the few men of science who never terrified me, probably because
he never behaved like a doctor. whenever he performed a minor service for jem
and me, as removing a splinter from a foot, he would tell us exactly what he was
going to do, give us an estimation of how much it would hurt, and explain the use
of any tongs he employed. one christmas i lurked in corners n

there went with the house the usual legend about the yankees: one finch female,
recently engaged, donned her complete trousseau to save it from raiders in the
neighborhood; she became stuck in the door to the daughtersâ€™ staircase but was
doused with water and finally pushed through. when we arrived at the landing,
aunt alexandra kissed uncle jack, francis kissed uncle jack, uncle jimmy
shook hands silently with uncle jack, jem and i gave our presents to francis, who
gave us a present. jem felt his age and gravitated to the adults, leaving me to
entertain our cousin. francis was eight and slicked back his hair.
â€œwhatâ€™d you get for christmas?â€ i asked politely.
â€œjust what i asked for,â€ he said. francis had requested a pair of knee-pants, a red
leather booksack, five shirts and an untied bow tie.
â€œthatâ€™s nic

œno, a real one. heâ€™s gonna make me some invisible ink, and iâ€™m gonna write to
dill in it.â€
francis asked what was the use of that.
â€œwell, canâ€™t you just see his face when he gets a letter from me with nothing in it?
itâ€™ll drive him nuts.â€
talking to francis gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the bottom of the
ocean. he was the most boring child i ever met. as he lived in mobile, he could
not inform on me to school authorities, but he managed to tell everything he knew
to aunt alexandra, who in turn unburdened herself to atticus, who either forgot it
or gave me hell, whichever struck his fancy. but the only time i ever heard
atticus speak sharply to anyone was when i once heard him say, â€œsister, i do the
best i can with them!â€ it had something to do with my going around in overalls.
aunt alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire. i could not possibly
hope to be a lady if i wore breeches; when i said i could do nothing in a dress, she
said i wasnâ€™t supposed to b

vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing
the add-a-pearl necklace she gave me when i was born; furthermore, i should be
a ray of sunshine in my fatherâ€™s lonely life. i suggested that one could be a ray of

sunshine in pants just as well, but aunty said that one had to behave like a
sunbeam, that i was born good but had grown progressively worse every year.

jem and francis graduated to the big table. i often wondered what she thought iâ€™d
do, get up and throw something? i sometimes thought of asking her if she would
let me sit at the big table with the rest of them just once, i would prove to her how
civilized i could be; after all, i ate at home every day with no major mishaps.
when i begged atticus to use his influence, he said he had noneâ€”we were
guests, and we sat where she told us to sit. he also said aunt alexandra didnâ€™t
understand girls much, sheâ€™d never had one.
but her cooking made up for everything: three kinds of meat, summer vegetables
from her pantry shelves; peach pickles, two kinds of cake and ambrosia
constituted a modest christmas dinner. afterwards, the adults made for the
livingroom and sat around in a dazed condition. jem lay on the floor, and i went
to the back yard. â€œput on your coat,â€ said atticus dreamily, so i didnâ€™t hear him.
francis sat beside me on the back steps. â€œthat

â€œyou still mad, jean louise?â€ he asked tentatively.
â€œnothing to speak of,â€ i said.

francis came out on the catwalk.
â€œyou gonna take it back, fraâ€”ancis?â€ but i was too quick on the draw. francis
shot back into the kitchen, so i retired to the steps. i could wait patiently. i had sat
there perhaps five minutes when i heard aunt alexandra speak: â€œwhereâ€™s
francis?â€
â€œheâ€™s out yonder in the kitchen.â€
â€œhe knows heâ€™s not supposed to play in there.â€
francis came to the door and yelled, â€œgrandma, sheâ€™s got me in here and she
wonâ€™t let me out!â€
â€œwhat is all this, jean louise?â€
i looked up at aunt alexandra. â€œi havenâ€™t got him in there, aunty, i ainâ€™t holdinâ€˜

â€œnome.â€

aunt alexandra was a back-porch listener. the moment she was out of sight
francis came out head up and grinning. â€œdonâ€™t you fool with me,â€ he said.
he jumped into the yard and kept his distance, kicking tufts of grass, turning
around occasionally to smile at me. jem appeared on the porch, looked at us, and
went away. francis climbed the mimosa tree, came down, put his hands in his
pockets and strolled around the yard. â€œhah!â€ he said. i asked him who he thought
he was, uncle jack? francis said he rec

this time, i split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth. my left impaired, i
sailed in with my right, but not for long. uncle jack pinned my arms to my sides
and said, â€œstand still!â€
aunt alexandra ministered to francis, wiping his tears away with her
handkerchief, rubbing his hair, patting his cheek. atticus, jem, and uncle jimmy
had come to the back porch when francis started yelling.
â€œwho started this?â€ said uncle jack.
francis and i pointed at each other. â€œgrandma,â€ he bawled, â€œshe called me a
whore-lady and jumped on me!â€

we were on the sidewalk by the radley place.
â€œlook on the porch yonder,â€ jem said.
i looked over to the radley place, expecting to see its phantom occupant sunning
himself in the swing. the swing was empty.
â€œi mean our porch,â€ said jem.
i looked down the street. enarmored, upright, uncompromising, aunt alexandra
was sitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat there every day of her life.

â€œput my bag in the front bedroom, calpurnia,â€ was the first thing aunt alexandra
said. â€œjean louise, stop scratching your head,â€ was the second thing she said.
calpurnia picked up auntyâ€™s heavy suitcase and opened the door. â€œiâ€™ll take it,â€
said jem, and took it. i heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump. the
sound had a dull permanence about it

. â€œhave you come for a visit, aunty?â€ i
asked. aunt alexandraâ€™s visits from the landing were rare, and she traveled in
state. she owned a bright green square buick and a black chauffeur, both kept in
an unhealthy state of tidiness, but today they were nowhere to be seen.
â€œdidnâ€™t your father tell you?â€ she asked.
jem and i shook our heads.
â€œprobably he forgot. heâ€™s not in yet, is he?â€
â€œnome, he doesnâ€™t usually get back till late afternoon,â€ said jem.
â€œwell, your father and i decided it was time i came to stay with you for a while.â€

ve made several answers to this: calâ€™s a girl, it would be many years
before i would be interested in boys, i would never be interested in clothesâ€¦ but
i kept quiet.
â€œwhat about uncle jimmy?â€ asked jem. â€œis he cominâ€˜, too?â€
â€œoh no, heâ€™s staying at the landing. heâ€™ll keep the place going.â€
the moment i said, â€œwonâ€™t you miss him?â€ i realized that this was not a tactful
question. uncle jimmy present or uncle jimmy absent made not much difference,
he never said anything. aunt alexandra ignored my question.
i could think of nothing else to say to her. in fact i could never think of anything
to say to her, and i sat thinking of past painful conversations between us: how are
you, jean louise? fine, thank you maâ€™am, how are you? very well, thank you,
what have you been doing with yourself? nothinâ€˜. donâ€™t you do anything? nome.
certainly you have friends? yessum. well what do you all do? nothinâ€™.
it was plain that aunty thought me dull in the extreme, because i once heard

her
tell atticus that i was sluggish.
there was a story behind all this, but i had no desire to extract it from her then.
today was sunday, and aunt alexandra was positively irritable on the lordâ€™s
day. i guess it was her sunday corset. she was not fat, but solid, and she chose
protective garments that drew up her bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her
waist, flared out her rear, and managed to suggest that aunt alexandraâ€™s was once
an hour-glass figure. from any angle, it was formidable.
the remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that descends when
relatives appear, but was dispelled when we heard a car turn in the driveway. it
was atticus, home from montgomery. jem, forgetting his dignity, ran with me to
meet him. jem seized his briefcase and bag, i jumped into his arms, felt his vague
dry kiss and said, â€œâ€˜d you bring me a book? â€™d you know auntyâ€™s here?â€
atticus answered both quest

i said i would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must lie under certain
circumstances and at all times when one canâ€™t do anything about them.
â€œwe felt it was time you children neededâ€”well, itâ€™s like this, scout,â€ atticus
said. â€œyour auntâ€™s doing me a favor as well as you all. i canâ€™t stay here all day
with you, and the summerâ€™s going to be a hot one.â€
â€œyes sir,â€ i said, not understanding a word he said. i had an idea, however, that
aunt alexandraâ€™s appearance on the scene was not so much atticusâ€™s doing as
hers. aunty had a way of declaring what is best for the family, and i suppose
her coming to live with us was in that category.
maycomb welcomed her. miss maudie atkinson baked a lane cake so loaded
with shinny it made me tight; miss stephanie crawford had long visits with aunt
alexandra, consisting mostly of miss stephanie shaking her head and saying,
â€œuh, uh, uh.â€ miss rachel next door had aunty over for coffee in the afterno

glad to see her.
when she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, aunt alexandra
seemed as if she had always lived with us. her missionary society refreshments
added to her reputation as a hostess (she did not permit calpurnia to make the
delicacies required to sustain the society through long reports on rice christians);
she joined and became secretary of the maycomb amanuensis club. to all
parties present and participating in the life of the county, aunt alexandra was one
of the last of her kind: she had river-boat, boarding-school manners; let any moral

e would uphold it; she was born in the objective case; she was
an incurable gossip. when aunt alexandra went to school, self-doubt could not
be found in any textbook, so she knew not its meaning. she was never bored, and
given the slightest chance she would exercise her royal prerogative: she would
arrange, advise, caution, and warn.
she never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of other tribal
groups to the greater glory of our own, a habit that amused jem rather than
annoyed him: â€œaunty better watch how she talksâ€”scratch most folks in
maycomb and theyâ€™re kin to us.â€

endency to mind
other peopleâ€™s business was hereditary, atticus said, â€œsister, when you stop to
think about it, our generationâ€™s practically the first in the finch family not to
marry its cousins. would you say the finches have an incestuous streak?â€
aunty said no, thatâ€™s where we got our small hands and feet.
i never understood her preoccupation with heredity. somewhere, i had received
the impression that fine folks were people who did the best they could with the
sense they had, but aunt alexandra was of the opinion, obliquely expressed, that
the longer a family had been squatting on one patch of land the finer it was.
â€œthat makes the ewells fine folks, then,â€ said jem. the tribe of which burris
ewell and his brethren consisted had lived on the same plot of earth behind the
maycomb dump, and had thrived on county welfare money for three generations.
aunt alexandraâ€™s theory had something behind it, though. maycomb was an
ancient town. it was twenty miles east of finchâ€™s landing, a

business, every third merriweather is morbid, the truth is not in the
delafields, all the bufords walk like that, were simply guides to daily living:
never take a check from a delafield without a discreet call to the bank; miss
maudie atkinsonâ€™s shoulder stoops because she was a buford; if mrs. grace
merriweather sips gin out of lydia e. pinkham bottles itâ€™s nothing unusualâ€”her

mother did the same.
aunt alexandra fitted into the world of maycomb like a hand into a glove, but
never into the world of jem and me. i so often wondered how she could be
atticusâ€™s and uncle jackâ€™s sister that i revived half-remembered tales of
changelings and mandrake roots that jem had spun long ago.
these were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay, as she had little to
say to jem or me, and we saw her only at mealtimes and at night before we went
to bed. it was summer and we were outdoors. of course some a

would run inside for a drink of water, i would find the livingroom overrun with
maycomb ladies, sipping, whispering, fanning, and i would be called: â€œjean

when i appeared in the doorway, aunty would look as if she regretted her
request; i was usually mud-splashed or covered with sand.
â€œspeak to your cousin lily,â€ she said one afternoon, when she had trapped me in
the hall.
â€œwho?â€ i said.
â€œyour cousin lily brooke,â€ said aunt alexandra.
â€œshe our cousin? i didnâ€™t know that.â€
aunt alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle apology to
cousin lily and firm disapproval to me. when cousin lily brooke left i knew i
was in for it.
it was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the finch family,
or to install any pride into his children. she summoned jem, who sat warily on the
sofa beside me. she left the room and returned with a purple-covered book on
which meditations of joshua s. st. clair wa

â€œyour cousin wrote this,â€ said aunt alexandra. â€œhe was a beautiful character.â€
jem examined the small volume. â€œis this the cousin joshua who was locked up
for so long?â€
aunt alexandra said, â€œhow did you know that?â€
â€œwhy, atticus said he went round the bend at the university. said he tried to

shoot the president. said cousin joshua said he wasnâ€™t anything but a sewer-
inspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock pistol, only it just blew up in
his hand. atticus said it cost the family five hundred dollars to get him out of that

he grinned.
â€œ

throaty noise, and i thought he must at last be getting old, but he looked the same.
â€i donâ€™t exactly know how to say this,â€œ he began.
â€œwell, just say it,â€ said jem. â€œhave we done something?â€
our father was actually fidgeting. â€œno, i just want to explain to you thatâ€”your
aunt alexandra asked meâ€¦ son, you know youâ€™re a finch, donâ€™t you?â€
â€œthatâ€™s what iâ€™ve been told.â€ jem looked out of the corners of his eyes. his voice
rose uncontrollably, â€œatticus, whatâ€™s the matter?â€
atticus crossed his knees and folded his arms. â€œiâ€™m trying to tell you the facts of
life.â€
jemâ€™s disgust deepened. â€œi know all that stuff,â€ he said.
atticus suddenly grew serious. in his lawyerâ€™s voice, without a shade of
inflection, he said: â€œyour aunt has asked me to try a

worry him. we did not speak to him.
presently i picked up a comb from jemâ€™s dresser and ran its teeth along the edge.
â€œstop that noise,â€ atticus said.
his curtness stung me. the comb was midway in its journey, and i banged it
down. for no reason i felt myself beginning to cry, but i could not stop. this was
not my father. my father never thought these thoughts. my father never spoke so.
aunt alexandra had put him up to this, somehow. through my tears i saw jem
standing in a similar pool of isolation, his head cocked to one side.
there was nowhere to go, but i turned to go and met atticusâ€™s vest front. i buried
my head in it and listened to the small internal noises that went on behind the
light blue cloth: his watch ticking, the faint crackle of his starched shirt, the soft
sound of his breathing.

woman to do that kind of work.

although we heard no more about the finch family from aunt alexandra, we
heard plenty from the town. on saturdays, armed with our nickels, when jem
permitted me to accompany him (he was now positively allergic to my presence
when in public), we would squirm our way through sweating sidewalk crowds
and sometimes hear, â€œthereâ€™s his chillun,â€ or, â€œyonderâ€™s some finches.â€ turning
to face our accusers, we would see only a couple of farmers studying the enema
bags in the mayco drugstore window. or two dumpy countrywomen in straw hats

â€œwell, i asked calpurnia cominâ€˜ from church that day what it was and she said

his paper was now in his lap. â€œagain, please,â€ he said.

enjoy it, but aunt alexandra, who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing, put
down her embroidery and stared at us.
â€œyou all were coming back from calpurniaâ€™s church that sunday?â€
jem said, â€œyessum, she took us.â€

aunt alexandra was worrying her embroidery. punk, punk, punk, her needle
broke the taut circle. she stopped, and pulled the cloth tighter: punk-punk-punk.
she was furious.
jem got up and padded across the rug. he motioned me to follow. he led me to
his room and closed the door. his face was grave.

â€œwho started it?â€ asked atticus, in resignation.
â€œjem did. he was tryinâ€˜ to tell me what to do. i donâ€™t have to mind him now, do

aunt alexandra was present but silent, and when she went down the hall with
atticus we heard her say, â€œâ€¦just one of the things iâ€™ve been telling you about,â€ a
phrase that united us again.
ours were adjoining rooms; as i shut the door between them jem said, â€œnight,
scout.â€
â€œnight,â€ i murmured, picking my way across the room to turn on the light. as i

she had been there, but i suppose struck dumb most of the time. â€œyou children

we left them in the diningroom, atticus still mopping his face. â€œfrom rape to riot
to runaways,â€ we heard him chuckle. â€œi wonder what the next two hours will
bring.â€
since things appeared to have worked out pretty well, dill and i decided to be

after many telephone calls, much pleading on behalf of the defendant, and a long
forgiving letter from his mother, it was decided that dill could stay. we had a
week of peace together. after that, little, it seemed. a nightmare was upon us.
it began one evening after supper. dill was over; aunt alexandra was in her chair
in the corner, atticus was in his; jem and i were on the floor reading. it had been
a placid week: i had minded aunty; jem had outgrown the treehouse, but helped
dill and me construct a new rope ladder for it; dill had hit upon a foolproof plan
to make boo radley come out at no cost to ourselves (place a trail of lemon drops
from the back door to the front yard and heâ€™d follow it, like an ant). there was a
knock on the front door, jem answered it and said it was mr. heck tate

.
â€œwell, ask him to come in,â€ said atticus.
â€œi already did. thereâ€™s some men outside in the yard, they want you to come out.â€
in maycomb, grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two reasons:
death and politics. i wondered who had died. jem and i went to the front door, but
atticus called, â€œgo back in the house.â€
jem turned out the livingroom lights and pressed his nose to a window screen.
aunt alexandra protested. â€œjust for a second, aunty, letâ€™s see who it is,â€ he said.
dill and i took another window. a crowd of men was standing around atticus.
they all seemed to be talking at once.
â€œâ€¦movinâ€˜ him to the county jail tomorrow,â€ mr. tate was saying, â€œi donâ€™t look
for any trouble, but i canâ€™t guarantee there wonâ€™t be anyâ€¦â€

he liked to be by himself in church.
the fake peace that prevailed on sundays was made more irritating by aunt
alexandraâ€™s presence. atticus would flee to his office directly after dinner, where
if we sometimes looked in on him, we would find him sitting back in his swivel
chair reading. aunt alexandra composed herself for a two-hour nap and dared us
to make any noise in the yard, the neighborhood was resting. jem in his old age
had taken to his room with a stack of football magazines. so dill and i spent our

sundays creeping around in deerâ€™s pasture.
shooting on sundays was prohibited, so dill and i kicked jemâ€™s football around
the pasture for a while, which was no fun. dill asked if iâ€™d like to have a poke at
boo radley. i said i didnâ€™t think itâ€™d be nice to bother him, and spen

the memory of
atticus calmly folding his newspaper and pushing back his hat became atticus
standing in the middle of an empty waiting street, pushing up his glasses. the full
meaning of the nightâ€™s events hit me and i began crying. jem was awfully nice

about it: for once he didnâ€™t remind me that people nearly nine years old didnâ€™t do
things like that.
everybodyâ€™s appetite was delicate this morning, except jemâ€™s: he ate his way
through three eggs. atticus watched in frank admiration; aunt alexandra sipped
coffee and radiated waves of disapproval. children who slipped out at night were
a disgrace to the family. atticus said he was right glad his disgraces had come
along, but aunty said, â€œnonsense, mr. underwood was there all the time.â€
â€œyou know, itâ€™s a funny thing about braxton,â€ said atticus. â€œhe despises
negroes, wonâ€™t have one near him.â€
local opinion held mr. underwood to be an intense, profane little man, whose
father in a fey fit of humor christened braxton bragg, a

done his best to live down. atticus said naming people after confederate generals

calpurnia was serving aunt alexandra more coffee, and she shook her head at
what i thought was a pleading winning look. â€œyouâ€™re still too little,â€ she said.
â€œiâ€™ll tell you when you ainâ€™t.â€ i said it might help my stomach. â€œall right,â€ she
said, and got a cup from the sideboard. she poured one tablespoonful of coffee
into it and filled the cup to the brim with milk. i thanked her by sticking out my
tongue at it, and looked up to catch auntyâ€™s warning frown. but she was frowning
at atticus.
she waited until calpu

â€œtalk like what in front of whom?â€ he asked.
â€œlike that in front of calpurnia. you said braxton underwood despises negroes
right in front of her.â€
â€œwell, iâ€™m sure cal knows it. everybody in maycomb knows it.â€
i was beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these days, that came out
when he talked with aunt alexandra. it was a quiet digging in, never outright
irritation. there was a faint starchiness in his voice when he said, â€œanything fit to
say at the tableâ€™s fit to say in front of calpurnia. she knows what she means to
this family.â€

â€œi donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good habit, atticus. it encourages them. you know how they
talk among themselves. every thing that happens in this townâ€™s out to the

my father put down his knife. â€œi donâ€™t know of any law that says they ca

well, i hoped jem would understand folks a little better when he was older; i
wouldnâ€™t. â€œfirst day walter comes back to schoolâ€™ll be his last,â€ i affirmed.
â€œyou will not touch him,â€ atticus said flatly. â€œi donâ€™t want either of you bearing a
grudge about this thing, no matter what happens.â€

â€œyou see, donâ€™t you,â€ said aunt alexandra, â€œwhat comes of things like this.
donâ€™t say i havenâ€™t told you.â€
atticus said heâ€™d never say that, pushed out his chair and got up. â€œthereâ€™s a day
ahead, so excuse me. jem, i donâ€™t want you and scout downtown today, please.â€
as atticus departed, dill came bounding down the hall into the diningroom. â€œitâ€™s

â€œcome on round here, son, i got something thatâ€™ll settle your stomach.â€
as mr. dolphus raymond was an evil man i accepted his invitation reluctantly,
but i followed dill. somehow, i didnâ€™t think atticus would like it if we became
friendly with mr. raymond, and i knew aunt alexandra wouldnâ€™t.
â€œhere,â€ he said, offering dill his paper sack with straws in it. â€œtake a good sip,

itâ€™ll quieten you.â€
dill sucked on the straws, smiled, and pulled at length.
â€œhee hee,â€ said mr. raymond, evidently taking delight in corrupting a child.
â€œdill, you watch out, now,â€ i warned.
dill released the straws and grinned. â€œscout, itâ€™s nothing but coca-cola.â€

little remorse, and she sailed up the front steps with her classic, â€œif mr. finch

jem went in grinning, and calpurnia nodded tacit consent to having dill in to
supper. â€œyou all call miss rachel right now and tell her where you are,â€ she told
him. â€œsheâ€™s run distracted lookinâ€˜ for youâ€”you watch out she donâ€™t ship you
back to meridian first thing in the morninâ€™.â€
aunt alexandra met us and nearly fainted when calpurnia told her where we
were. i guess it hurt her when we told her atticus said we could go back, because
she didnâ€™t say a word during supper. she just rearranged food on her plate,
looking at it sadly while calpurnia served jem, dill and me with a vengeance.
calpurnia poured milk, dished out potato salad and ham, muttering, â€œâ€˜shamed of

command.

way through the cheerful crowd. â€œit ainâ€™t right,â€ he muttered, all the way to the
corner of the square where we found atticus waiting. atticus was standing under
the street light looking as though nothing had happened: his vest was buttoned,
his collar and tie were neatly in place, his watch-chain glistened, he was his

impassive self again.
â€œit ainâ€™t right, atticus,â€ said jem.
â€œno son, itâ€™s not right.â€
we walked home.
aunt alexandra was waiting up. she was in her dressing gown, and i could have
sworn she had on her corset underneath it. â€œiâ€™m sorry, brother,â€ she murmured.
having never heard her call atticus â€œbrotherâ€ before, i stole a glance at jem, but
he was not listening. he would look up at atticus, then down at the floor, and i
wondered if he thought atticus somehow responsible for tom robinsonâ€™s
conviction.
â€œis he all right?â€ aunty asked, indicating jem.
â€œheâ€™ll be so presently,â€ said atticus. â€

â€œi didnâ€™t think it wise in the first place to let themâ€”â€
â€œthis is their home, sister,â€ said atticus. â€œweâ€™ve made it this way for them, they
might as well learn to cope with it.â€
â€œbut they donâ€™t have to go to the courthouse and wallow in itâ€”â€
â€œitâ€™s just as much maycomb county as missionary teas.â€

thought would turn bitter over this.â€
â€œiâ€™m not bitter, just tired. iâ€™m going to bed.â€

he turned in the doorway. â€œwhat, son?â€
â€œhow could they do it, how could they?â€

â€œi ainâ€™t cynical, miss alexandra. tellinâ€˜ the truthâ€™s not cynical, is it?â€

nearly blew us off the sidewalk when we came up. miss stephanie was trembling
with excitement, and miss rachel caught dillâ€™s shoulder. â€œyou get on in the back

â€œainâ€™t you heard yet? itâ€™s all over townâ€”â€
at that moment aunt alexandra came to the door and called us, but she was too

â€œyou know he didnâ€™t even have one down at the jail that night. he told me havinâ€˜
a gun aroundâ€™s an invitation to somebody to shoot you.â€
â€œthis is different,â€ i said. â€œwe can ask him to borrow one.â€
we did, and he said, â€œnonsense.â€
dill was of the opinion that an appeal to atticusâ€™s better nature might work: after

all, we would starve if mr. ewell killed him, besides be raised exclusively by
aunt alexandra, and we all knew the first thing sheâ€™d do before atticus was
under the ground good would be to fire calpurnia. jem said it might work if i
cried and flung a fit, being young and a girl. that didnâ€™t work either. but when he
noticed us dragging around the neighborhood, not eating, taking little interest in
our normal pursuits, atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were. he
tempted jem with a new football magazine one night; when he saw jem flip the
pages and toss it aside, he said, â€œw

n he said it,â€ said atticus. â€œjem, see if you can stand in bob
ewellâ€™s shoes a minute. i destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he
had any to begin with. the man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind
always does. so if spitting in my face and threatening me saved mayella ewell
one extra beating, thatâ€™s something iâ€™ll gladly take. he had to take it out on
somebody and iâ€™d rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. you
understand?â€
jem nodded.
aunt alexandra entered the room as atticus was saying, â€œwe donâ€™t have anything
to fear from bob ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning.â€
â€œi wouldnâ€™t be so sure of that, atticus,â€ she said. â€œhis kindâ€™d do anything to pay
off a grudge. you know how those people are.â€
â€œwhat on earth could ewell do to me, sister?â€
â€œsomething furtive,â€ aunt alexandra said. â€œyou may count on that.â€
â€œnobody has much chance to be furtive in maycomb,â€ atticus answered.

â€œhow can that be?â€
â€œtwo sisters married two brothers. thatâ€™s all iâ€™ll tell youâ€”you figure it out.â€
i tortured myself and decided that if i married jem and dill had a sister whom he
married our children would be double first cousins. â€œgee minetti, jem,â€ i said,
when atticus had gone, â€œtheyâ€™re funny folks. â€˜d you hear that, aunty?â€
aunt alexandra was hooking a rug and not watching us, but she was listening.
she sat in her chair with her workbasket beside it, her rug spread across her lap.
why ladies hooked woolen rugs on boiling nights never became clear to me.
â€œi heard it,â€ she said.
i remembered the distant disastrous occasion when i rushed to young walter
cunninghamâ€™s defense. now i was glad iâ€™d done it. â€œsoonâ€™s school starts iâ€™m

always a threat, never a promise. surprised, i turned to her. â€œwhy not, aunty?
theyâ€™re good folks.â€
she looked at me over her sewing glasses. â€œjean louise, there is no doubt in my
mind that theyâ€™re good folks. but theyâ€™re not our kind of folks.â€

her foot down. i never knew why. it was when i was absorbed with plans to visit
calpurniaâ€™s houseâ€”i was curious, interested; i wanted to be her â€œcompany,â€ to
see how she lived, who her friends were. i might as well have wanted to see the
other side of the moon. this time the tactics were different, but aunt alexandraâ€™s
aim was the same. perhaps this was why she had come to live with usâ€”to help us
choose our friends. i w

acknowledge â€˜em or not, and it makes you look right silly when you donâ€™t.â€
â€œthatâ€™s your father all over again,â€ said aunt alexandra, â€œand i still say that jean
louise will not invite walter cunningham to this house. if he were her double
first cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he
comes to see atticus on business. now that is that.â€
she had said indeed not, but this time she would give her reasons: â€œbut i want to
play with walter, aunty, why canâ€™t i?â€
she took off her glasses and stared at me. â€œiâ€™ll tell you why,â€ she said. â€œbecauseâ€”

calpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron. she carried a tray of charlotte. she
backed up to the swinging door and pressed gently. i admired the ease and grace
with which she handled heavy loads of dainty things. so did aunt alexandra, i
guess, because she had let calpurnia serve today.
august was on the brink of september. dill would be leaving for meridian
tomorrow; today he was off with jem at barkerâ€™s eddy. jem had discovered with
angry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach dill how to swim, a

skill jem considered necessary as walking. they had spent two afternoons at the
creek, they said they were going in naked and i couldnâ€™t come, so i divided the
lonely hours between calpurnia and miss maudie.

aunt alexandra and her missionary circle were fighting the good fight all

report in the livingroom on the squalid lives of the mrunas, it sounded like to me.
they put the women out in huts when their time came, whatever that was; they
had no sense of familyâ€”i knew thatâ€™d distress auntyâ€”they subjected children to

and then got drunk on it.
immediately thereafter, the ladies adjourned for refreshments.
i didnâ€™t know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out. aunt alexandra told
me to join them for refreshments; it was not necessary that i attend the business
part of the meeting, she said itâ€™d bore me. i was wearing my pink sunday dress,
shoes, and a petticoat, and reflected that if i spilled anything calpurnia would
have to wash my dress again for tomorrow. this had been a busy day for her. i
decided to stay out.
â€œcan i help you, cal?â€ i asked, wishing to be of some service.
calpurnia paused in the doorway. â€œyou be still as a mouse in that corner,â€ she

â€œif you be careful and donâ€™t drop it. set it down at the end of the table by miss

alexandra. down there by the cupsâ€™n things. sheâ€™s gonna pour.â€
i tried pressing my behind against the door as calpurnia had done, but the door
didnâ€™t budge. grinning, she held it open for me. â€œcareful now, itâ€™s heavy. donâ€™t
look at it and you wonâ€™t spill it.â€
my journey was successful: aunt alexandra smiled brilliantly. â€œstay with us,
jean louise,â€ she said. this was a part of her campaign to teach me to be a lady.
it was customary for every circle hostess to invite her neighbors in for
refreshments, be they baptists or presbyterians, which accounted for the presence
of miss rachel (sober as a judge), miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford.
rather nervous, i took a seat beside miss maudie and wondered why ladies put on
their hats to go across the street. ladies in bunches always filled

miss maudie said it. two tight lines had appeared at the corners of her mouth.
she had been sitting silently beside me, her coffee cup balanced on one knee. i
had lost the thread of conversation long ago, when they quit talking about tom
robinsonâ€™s wife, and had contented myself with thinking of finchâ€™s landing and
the river. aunt alexandra had got it backwards: the business part of the meeting
was blood-curdling, the social hour was dreary.
â€œmaudie, iâ€™m sure i donâ€™t know what you mean,â€ said mrs. merriweather.
â€œiâ€™m sure you do,â€ miss maudie said shortly.
she said no more. when miss maudie was angry her brevity was icy. something
had made her deeply angry, and her gray eyes were as cold as her voice. mrs.
merriweather reddened, glanced at me, and looked away. i could not see mrs.

neatly engaging mrs. merriweather and mrs. gates in brisk conversation. when
she had them well on the road with mrs. perkins, aunt alexandra stepped back.
she gave miss maudie a look of pure gratitude, and i wondered at the world of
women. miss maudie and aunt alexandra had never been especially close, and
here was aunty silently thanking her for something. for what, i knew not. i was
content to learn that aunt alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude
for help given. there was no doubt about it, i must soon enter this world, where
on its surface fragrant ladies rocked slowly, fanned gently, and drank cool water.
but i was more at home in my fatherâ€™s world. people like mr. heck tate did not
trap you with innocent questions to make fun of you; even jem was not highly
critical unless you said something stupid. ladies seemed to live in faint horror of
men, seemed unwilling to approve wholehearted

he stopped in the doorway. his hat was in his hand, and his face was white.
â€œexcuse me, ladies,â€ he said. â€œgo right ahead with your meeting, donâ€™t let me
disturb you. alexandra, could you come to the kitchen a minute? i want to borrow
calpurnia for a while.â€

he didnâ€™t go through the diningroom, but went down the back hallway and
entered the kitchen from the rear door. aunt alexandra and i met him. the
diningroom door opened again and miss maudie joined us. calpurnia had half
risen from her chair.
â€œcal,â€ atticus said, â€œi want you to go with me out to helen robinsonâ€™s houseâ€”â€
â€œwhatâ€™s the matter?â€ aunt alexandra asked, alarmed by the look on my fatherâ€™s
face.
â€œtomâ€™s dead.â€
aunt alexandra put her hands to her mouth.
â€œthey shot him,â€ said atticus. â€œhe was running. it was during their exercise

they didnâ€™t have to shoot him that much. cal, i want you to come out with me
and help me tell helen.â€
â€œyes sir,â€ she murmured, fumbling at her apron. miss maudie went to calpurnia
and untied it.
â€œthis is the last straw, atticus,â€ aunt alexandra said.
â€œdepends on how you look at it,â€ he said. â€œwhat was one negro, more or less,
among two hundred of â€˜em? he wasnâ€™t tom to them, he was an escaping
prisoner.â€
atticus leaned against the refrigerator, pushed up his glasses, and rubbed his eyes.
â€œwe had such a good chance,â€ he said. â€œi told him what i thought, but i couldnâ€™t
in truth say that we had more than a good chance. i guess tom was tired of white

sat quite still; she was so quiet i wondered if she would faint. i heard miss
maudie breathing as if she had just climbed the steps, and in the diningroom the
ladies chattered happily.
i thought aunt alexandra was crying, but when she took her hands away from her
face, she was not. she looked weary. she spoke, and her voice was flat.
â€œi canâ€™t say i approve of everything he does, maudie, but heâ€™s my brother, and i
just want to know when this will ever end.â€ her voice rose: â€œit tears him to

background, but i found myself shaking and couldnâ€™t stop. i had seen enfield
prison farm, and atticus had pointed out the exercise yard to me. it was the size
of a football field.
â€œstop that shaking,â€ commanded miss maudie, and i stopped. â€œget up,
alexandra, weâ€™ve left â€˜em long enough.â€
aunt alexandra rose and smoothed the various whalebone ridges along her hips.

she took her handkerchief from her belt and wiped her nose. she patted her hair
and said, â€œdo i show it?â€
â€œnot a sign,â€ said miss maudie. â€œare you together again, jean louise?â€
â€œyes maâ€™am.â€
â€œthen letâ€™s join the ladies,â€ she said grimly.
their voices swelled when miss maudie opened the door to the diningroom. aunt
alexandra was ahead of me, and i saw her head go up as she went through the
door.
â€œoh, mrs. p

 women, around the diningroom,
refilling coffee cups, dishing out goodies as though their only regret was the
temporary domestic disaster of losing calpurnia. the gentle hum began again.
â€œyes sir, mrs. perkins, that j. grimes everett is a martyred saint, heâ€¦ needed to
get married so they ranâ€¦ to the beauty parlor every saturday afternoonâ€¦ soon as
the sun goes down. he goes to bed with theâ€¦ chickens, a crate full of sick
chickens, fred says thatâ€™s what started it all. fred saysâ€¦â€
aunt alexandra looked across the room at me and smiled. she looked at a tray of
cookies on the table and nodded at them. i carefully picked up the tray and
watched myself walk to mrs. merriweather. with my best company manners, i
asked her if she would have some.
after all, if aunty could be a lady at a time like this, so could i.

â€œyou donâ€™t have to touch her, all you have to do is make her afraid, anâ€˜ if assault
ainâ€™t enough to keep you locked up awhile, iâ€™ll get you in on the ladiesâ€™ law, so

mr. ewell evidently thought he meant it, for helen reported no further trouble.
â€œi donâ€™t like it, atticus, i donâ€™t like it at all,â€ was aunt alexandraâ€™s assessment of
these events. â€œthat man seems to have a permanent running grudge against
everybody connected with that case. i know how that kind are about paying off
grudges, but i donâ€™t understand why he should harbor oneâ€”he had his way in
court, didnâ€™t he?â€
â€œi think i understand,â€ said atticus. â€œit might be because he knows in his heart

thought heâ€™d be a hero, but all he got for his pain wasâ€

â€ atticus chuckled.
by the end of october, our lives had become the familiar routine of school, play,
study. jem seemed to have put out of his mind whatever it was he wanted to
forget, and our classmates mercifully let us forget our fatherâ€™s eccentricities. cecil
jacobs asked me one time if atticus was a radical. when i asked atticus, atticus
was so amused i was rather annoyed, but he said he wasnâ€™t laughing at me. he
said, â€œyou tell cecil iâ€™m about as radical as cotton tom heflin.â€
aunt alexandra was thriving. miss maudie must have silenced the whole
missionary society at one blow, for aunty again ruled that roost. her refreshments
grew even more delicious. i learned more about the poor mrunasâ€™ social life from
listening to mrs. merriweather: they had so little sense of family that the whole
tribe was one big family. a child had as many fathers as there were men in the
community, as many mothers as there were women. j. grimes everett was doing
his utmost to change this state of affair

eral discomforts,
though: it was hot, it was a close fit; if my nose itched i couldnâ€™t scratch, and once
inside i could not get out of it alone.
when halloween came, i assumed that the whole family would be present to
watch me perform, but i was disappointed. atticus said as tactfully as he could
that he just didnâ€™t think he could stand a pageant tonight, he was all in. he had
been in montgomery for a week and had come home late that afternoon. he
thought jem might escort me if i asked him.
aunt alexandra said she just had to get to bed early, sheâ€™d been decorating the
stage all afternoon and was worn outâ€”she stopped short in the middle of her
sentence. she closed her mouth, then opened it to say something, but no words
came.
â€œâ€˜s matter, aunty?â€ i asked.
â€œoh nothing, nothing,â€ she said, â€œsomebody just walked over my grave.â€ she put
away from her whatever it was that gave her a pinprick of apprehension, and
suggested that i give the family a preview in the livingroom. so jem squ

n to the street light. a man was passing under it. the man was walking with
the staccato steps of someone carrying a load too heavy for him. he was going
around the corner. he was carrying jem. jemâ€™s arm was dangling crazily in front
of him.
by the time i reached the corner the man was crossing our front yard. light from
our front door framed atticus for an instant; he ran down the steps, and together,
he and the man took jem inside.
i was at the front door when they were going down the hall. aunt alexandra was
running to meet me. â€œcall dr. reynolds!â€ atticusâ€™s voice came sharply from
jemâ€™s room. â€œwhereâ€™s scout?â€
â€œhere she is,â€ aunt alexandra called, pulling me along with her to the telephone.
she tugged at me anxiously. â€œiâ€™m all right, aunty,â€ i said, â€œyou better call.â€
she pulled the receiver from the hook and said, â€œeula may, get dr. reynolds,
quick!â€
â€œagnes, is your father home? oh god, where is he? please tell him to come over
here as soon as he comes in. ple

ase, itâ€™s urgent!â€
there was no need for aunt alexandra to identify herself, people in maycomb
knew each otherâ€™s voices.
atticus came out of jemâ€™s room. the moment aunt alexandra broke the
connection, atticus took the receiver from her. he rattled the hook, then said,
â€œeula may, get me the sheriff, please.â€
â€œheck? atticus finch. someoneâ€™s been after my children. jemâ€™s hurt. between
here and the schoolhouse. i canâ€™t leave my boy. run out there for me, please, and
see if heâ€™s still around. doubt if youâ€™ll find him now, but iâ€™d like to see him if you
do. got to go now. thanks, heck.â€
â€œatticus, is jem dead?â€

â€œno, scout. look after her, sister,â€

 he called, as he went down the hall.
aunt alexandraâ€™s fingers trembled as she unwound the crushed fabric and wire
from around me. â€œare you all right, darling?â€ she asked over and over as she
worked me free.
it was a relief to be out. my arms were beginning to tingle, and they were red with
small hexagonal marks. i rubbed them, and they felt better.
â€œaunty, is jem dead?â€
â€œnoâ€”no, darling, heâ€™s unconscious. we wonâ€™t know how badly heâ€™s hurt until
dr. reynolds gets here. jean louise, what happened?â€
â€œi donâ€™t know.â€

get together and decide.â€
dr. reynoldsâ€™s step was young and brisk. mr. heck tateâ€™s was not. his heavy
boots punished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly, but he said the same
thing dr. reynolds said when he came in. â€œyou all right, scout?â€ he added.
â€œyes sir, iâ€™m goinâ€˜ in to see jem. atticusâ€™nâ€™themâ€™s in there.â€
â€œiâ€™ll go with you,â€ said mr. tate.
aunt alexandra had shaded jemâ€™s reading light with a towel, and his room was
dim. jem was lying on his back. there was an ugly mark along one side of his
face. his left arm lay out from his body; his elbow was bent slightly, but in the
wrong direction. jem was frowning.
â€œjemâ€¦?â€
atticus spoke. â€œhe canâ€™t hear you, scout, heâ€™s out like a light. he was coming
around, but dr. reynolds put him out again.â€
â€œyes sir.â€ i retreated. jemâ€™s room was large and square. aunt alexandra was

atticus was standing by jemâ€™s bed.
mr. heck tate stood in the doorway. his hat was in his hand, and a flashlight
bulged from his pants pocket. he was in his working clothes.

â€œcome in, heck,â€ said atticus. â€œdid you find anything? i canâ€™t conceive of
anyone low-down enough to do a thing like this, but i hope you found him.â€
mr. tate sniffed. he glanced sharply at the man in the corner, nodded to him, then
looked around the roomâ€”at jem, at aunt alexandra, then at atticus.
â€œsit down, mr. finch,â€ he said pleasantly.
atticus said, â€œletâ€™s all sit down. have that chair, heck. iâ€™ll get another one from
the livingroom.â€
mr. tate sat in jemâ€™s desk chair. he waited until atticus returned and settled
himself. i wondered why atticus had not brought a chair for the man in the
corner, but atticus knew the ways of country people far better than i. some of his
rural clients would park their long-eared steeds under the chinaberry trees in the

â€œthatâ€™s mâ€™costume, mr. tate.â€
mr. tate ran his hands down his thighs. he rubbed his left arm and investigated
jemâ€™s mantelpiece, then he seemed to be interested in the fireplace. his fingers
sought his long nose.
â€œwhat is it, heck?â€ said atticus.
mr. tate found his neck and rubbed it. â€œbob ewellâ€™s lyinâ€˜ on the ground under
that tree down yonder with a kitchen knife stuck up under his ribs. heâ€™s dead, mr.
finch.â€

aunt alexandra got up and reached for the mantelpiece. mr. tate rose, but she
declined assistance. for once in his life, atticusâ€™s instinctive courtesy failed him:
he sat where he was.
somehow, i could think of nothing but mr. bob ewell saying heâ€™d get atticus if it
took him the rest of his life. mr. ewell almost got him, and it was the last thing he
did.
â€œare you sure?â€ atticus said bleakly.
â€œheâ€™s dead all right,â€ said mr. tate. â€œheâ€™s good and dead. he wonâ€™t hurt these
children again.â€

â€œi didnâ€™t mean that.â€ atticus seemed to be talking in his sleep. his age was
beginning to show, his one sign of inner turmoil, the strong line of his jaw melted
a little, one became aware of telltale creases forming under his ears, one noticed
not his jet-black hair but the gray patches growing at his temples.
â€œhadnâ€™t we better go to the livingroom?â€ aunt alexandra said at last.
â€œif you donâ€™t mind,â€ said mr. tate, â€œiâ€™d rather us stay in here if it wonâ€™t hurt jem
any. i want to have a look at his injuries while scoutâ€¦ tells us about it.â€
â€œis it all right if i leave?â€ she asked. â€œiâ€™m just one person too many in here. iâ€™ll be
in my room if you want me, atticus.â€ aunt alexandra went to the door, but she
stopped and turned. â€œatticus, i had a feeling about this tonightâ€”iâ€”this is my
fault,â€ she began. â€œi should haveâ€”â€

â€”â€
â€œwhere were you when you thought it was cecil?â€
â€œjust a little piece from the schoolhouse. i yelled somethinâ€˜ at himâ€”â€
â€œyou yelled, what?â€
â€œcecil jacobs is a big fat hen, i think. we didnâ€™t hear nothinâ€˜â€”then jem yelled
hello or somethinâ€™ loud enough to wake the deadâ€”â€
â€œjust a minute, scout,â€ said mr. tate. â€œmr. finch, did you hear them?â€
atticus said he didnâ€™t. he had the radio on. aunt alexandra had hers going in her
bedroom. he remembered because she told him to turn his down a bit so she
could hear hers. atticus smiled. â€œi always play a radio too loud.â€
â€œi wonder if the neighbors heard anythingâ€¦â€ said mr. tate.
â€œi doubt it, heck. most of them listen to their radios or go to bed with the
chickens. maudie atkinson may have been up, but i doubt it.â€
â€œgo ahead, scout,â€ mr. tate said.
â€œwell, after jem yelled we walked on. mr. tate, i was shut up in my costume but

s so shaken he had to sit down again.
his hand searched for his hip pocket, and he pulled out a handkerchief. he
coughed into it, then he wiped his forehead.
having been so accustomed to his absence, i found it incredible that he had been
sitting beside me all this time, present. he had not made a sound.
once more, he got to his feet. he turned to me and nodded toward the front door.
â€œyouâ€™d like to say good night to jem, wouldnâ€™t you, mr. arthur? come right in.â€
i led him down the hall. aunt alexandra was sitting by jemâ€™s bed. â€œcome in,
arthur,â€ she said. â€œheâ€™s still asleep. dr. reynolds gave him a heavy sedative.
jean louise, is your father in the livingroom?â€
â€œyes maâ€™am, i think so.â€
â€œiâ€™ll just go speak to him a minute. dr. reynolds left someâ€¦â€ her voice trailed
away.
boo had drifted to a corner of the room, where he stood with his chin up, peering
from a distance at jem. i took him by the hand, a hand surprisingly warm for its
whiteness. i tugged him a little, an

the fine rain that was falling. as i made my way
home, i felt very old, but when i looked at the tip of my nose i could see fine

misty beads, but looking cross-eyed made me dizzy so i quit. as i made my way
home, i thought what a thing to tell jem tomorrow. heâ€™d be so mad he missed it
he wouldnâ€™t speak to me for days. as i made my way home, i thought jem and i
would get grown but there wasnâ€™t much else left for us to learn, except possibly
algebra.
i ran up the steps and into the house. aunt alexandra had gone to bed, and
atticusâ€™s room was dark. i would see if jem might be reviving. atticus was in
jemâ€™s room, sitting by his bed. he was reading a book.
â€œis jem awake yet?â€
â€œsleeping peacefully. he wonâ€™t be awake until morning.â€
â€œoh. are you sittinâ€˜ up with him?â€
â€œjust for an hour or so. go to bed, scout. youâ€™ve had a long day.â€
â€œwell, i think iâ€™ll stay with you for a while.â€
â€œsuit yourself,â€ said atticus. it must have been after midnight, and i was puzzled
