[CHARACTER] - 
                the
[CHARACTER], whom marlow also meets at the central station, is a
favorite of the manager and seems to be a kind of corporate spy.
he never actually produces any bricks, as he is supposedly waiting
for some essential element that is never delivered. he is petty
and conniving and assumes that other people 
are too.
