[CHARACTER] - 
                	o'brien's
closest friend and a model of quiet, rational morality amid the
atrocities of war. [CHARACTER]'s death, when the company mistakenly camps
in a sewage field, is the focal point of three stories. since it
is a prime example of arbitrary, unforgiving cruelty in war, [CHARACTER]'s
death is given more prominence than his life.
