 lofot-man,1 hans olsa, for everything.

 

1 a companion on the winter fishing grounds at the lofoten islands.

 

per hansa heaved a deep sigh; it came out before he could stop it. . . . huh!--it was an easy matter enough for hans olsa! he had ample means, and could start out on a big scale from the beginning; he had a wife in whose heart there wasn't a speck of fear! . . . the lord only knew where they were now--whether they were east or west of him! and they had tönseten, too, and his wife kjersti,2 both of them used to america. why, they could talk the language and everything. . . .

 

2 the combination kj in this name is pronounced like ch in church; the final i has the sound of y in godly.

 

and then there were the solum boys, who had actually been born in this country. . . . indeed, east or west, it made no difference to them where they lay that night.

but here was he, the newcomer, who owned nothing and knew nothing, groping about with his dear ones in the endless wilderness! .

 and his wife faced around in the direction that tönseten had indicated. sure enough, out of the west a little caravan was crawling up toward them on the prairie.

"can that be them? . . . i really believe it is!" said hans olsa in a half whisper, as if hardly daring yet to give vent to his joy.

"of course it is!" cried his wife, excitedly. . . . "thank god!"

"not the least doubt of it," tönseten assured them. "you might as well go and put your coffeepot on the stove, mother sörrina!1 that kjersti of mine is coming over pretty soon; she'll probably have something good tucked under her apron. . . . in half an hour we'll have the lost sheep back in the fold!"

 

1 the name properly is sörine, with the accent on the second syllable; but in the dialect of helgeland it is pronounced sörrina, with the accent on the first. these people all came from the district of helgeland, in norway.

 

"yes! heavens and earth, sörrina!" cried hans olsa, "fetch out the best you've got! . . . per, per, i

before the half hour allotted by tönseten had passed, the caravan came slowly crawling up the slope. per hansa still strode in the van, with store-hans at his side; ole walked abreast of the oxen, driving them with the goad. beret and and-ongen sat in the wagon. rosie came jogging along behind at her own gait; she gave a loud, prolonged "moo-o-o-o" as she discovered the other animals across the prairie.

both families stood ready to receive them; hans olsa and sörine, tönseten and his kjersti, all watching intently the movements of the approaching company; but the girl couldn't possess her patience any longer, and ran down to meet the new arrivals. she took store-hans by the hand and fell in beside him; the first question she asked was whether he hadn't been terribly scared at night? . . .

as the slope of the hill grew steeper, the oxen had to bend to the yoke.

"hey, there, folks!" shouted per hansa, boisterously. "don't be standing around loafing, now! it's only the middle of the

 calm. surely, surely, she mustn't give way to her tears now, in the midst of all this joy. . . .

then she followed the other two women into the tent; seeing a chair, she sank down in it, as if her strength had gone!

sörine was patting her on the shoulder. . . . "come, get your things off, beret. you ought to loosen up your clothes, you know. just throw this dress of mine around you. . . . here's the water to wash yourself in. let down your hair, and take your time about it. . . . don't mind kjersti and me being around."

after they had bustled about for a little while the others left her. the moment they had gone she jumped up and crossed the tent, to look out of the door. . . . how will human beings be able to endure this place? she thought. why, there isn't even a thing that one can hide behind! . . . her sensitive, rather beautiful face was full of blank dismay; she turned away from the door and began to loosen her dress; then her eyes fell on the centre pole with its crosspiece, hung

t . . . "here, take this off my hands, hans olsa--you will know what to do with it!"

 

1 this bottle and glass would have been old family pieces from norway, the bottle shaped something like an hourglass, with a contraction in the middle to be grasped by the hand.

 

tönseten fairly bubbled over in his admiration for her:

"oh, you sweet sörrina-girl!--you're dearer to my heart than a hundred women! . . . what a blessing it must be, to have a wife like that!"

"stop your foolishness!" said kjersti, but her voice didn't sound too severe.

for a long while they continued to sit around the cloth, chatting, eating, and drinking, and thoroughly enjoying themselves. hans olsa seemed like a different man from the one who had eaten here at noon. his loud voice led the cheerful talk; his ponderous bulk was always the centre of the merriment; it seemed as if he would never tire of gazing into that bearded, roguish face of per hansa's.

once, as per hansa was slicing off a piece of mutton, he regar

 their tent had been carried away in one of them; sörine, trapped inside and half choked, had been swept along with the canvas. hans olsa had laid the tent rope across his shoulder, planted his feet solidly in the ground, and summoned all his giant strength; but he had been whirled away like a tuft of wool. it had turned out all right, however; no one was seriously hurt . . . this time.

and then, the indians! . . . "injuns," as the red children of the great plain were called in common speech. kjersti, tönseten's wife, didn't mind the storms so much; they never committed inhuman outrages . . . weren't out for your scalp, at any rate! but fear of the indians was ever vividly present in her mind. not a day passed that she didn't search the sky line many times. . . . why, one of the savages actually lay buried over on per hansa's land! and where the dead had their abode, the living were sure to come. . . . since she had learned of the grave she was always on the lookout. . . .

truth to tell,

f the indians was very natural. she and syvert had heard the tale of the terrors of '62 so often that they could have repeated it word for word, as if from an open book. when they were living in fillmore county, minnesota, two refugees from the norway lake massacre had drifted into the place; the story of the horrors they had undergone had taken on new and gruesome details as it passed from mouth to mouth; out here now on the open prairie, where no hiding place could be found, the form in which kjersti remembered it had assumed the fantastic proportions of a myth.

tönseten, however, wasn't a bit afraid of the indians--not he! who ever heard of such nonsense? why should he or anyone else fear them, now that they had become peaceful and civilized? he tried his best to instill this idea into the others. . . . per hansa would sit listening to tönseten with a quizzical smile on his face. "that's right, syvert--go on," he would agree. "all the indians have turned into honest-to-god gentlemen the

meanwhile--well, no use to cross a bridge until you came to it.

the men never spoke of the indians while the womenfolk were around. but at other times, whenever the subject came up for discussion, ole and store-hans stood listening with open mouths. . . . the grave where they found the stones had now begun to strike a chill into their hearts; but it also exerted a strange and irresistible fascination.

. . . so here they all were, afraid of something or other. but the women were the worst off; kjersti feared the indians, sörine the storms; and beret, poor thing, feared both--and feared the very air.

the outcome of their deliberations that sunday was only what might have been expected; it seemed the logical thing for hans olsa and tönseten and henry solum, each of whom owned horses and wagon, to make up the party for the journey. that would give three men and three separate teams; such a caravan ought to be able to haul home on one trip whatever the settlement could afford to buy.

sam did as he was bid, without half understanding; he took his gun inside the house, stood it against the wall, and came out again; in front of the door he paused, staring open-mouthed at the approaching train. . . . seated above him on the roof, per hansa glanced alternately westward and down at the puzzled youth.

"i supposed we ought to warn kjersti--she's always so skittish," he said with a grin. "why don't you go down and tell her that our red neighbours are coming? . . . but don't scare the wits out of the poor woman!"

sam hesitated; the task obviously wasn't to his liking.

. . . "or should we wait, and let the indians take her scalp?"

at these words sam jumped, then suddenly broke into a run.

per hansa laughed heartily as he watched him go.

"hey, there! don't tear off as if your pants had caught fire!" he shouted. "you needn't be

in such an awful sweat about kjersti, either!"

but kjersti herself had seen the enemy; she must have been on the lookout, as usual. . . . at that moment she hove in sight on the slope of the hill, leading her cow.

at the same time ole arrived, with sörine and the girl close behind him; but sörine, unfortunately, hadn't thought of her cow, which was grazing off on the prairie to the westward, some distance from hans olsa's house.

soon they were all gathered in a little knot--the three women, ole, and the solum boy; but store-hans felt that it would

be safer with his father, and had gone over to where per hansa was still working. . . . kjersti was moaning and wailing because her syvert was away at a time when the lord sent such tribulations upon her; mother sörine was comforting her as best she could, saying that, after all, indians were only people--human beings . . . just human beings! . . . beret listened in stony silence to it all.

at last per hansa took a quick slide down from the roof and went over to the agitated group.

"what have we here--a sewing circle? . . . by george! it seems to me that three nice modest girls like yo

u oughtn't to be standing around and making eyes at strange menfolk! they've got their own women with 'em, too. . . . maybe the squaws would have a word or two to say about that!"

per hansa's sally broke the tension; beret immediately resumed her preparations for supper, and mother sörine began to help her, kjersti found a pail and milked her cow; and per hansa himself went back to his roof and laid a few more strips of sod before supper was ready.

. . . while they sat waiting for the porridge to cool, they watched with anxious attention the indian band as it crept up the slope of the hill toward the crest. the foremost team reached the summit, passed some distance beyond it on the other side, and came to a halt; at that they all drew up, the whole train forming a crescent around the brow of t

rself for being so shortsighted as to forget all about her precious cow. . . . as he saw the beast gallop away, per hansa cursed it from the bottom of his heart.

in an instant, before the little company sitting there had found time to gather their scattered wits, all the rest of their cattle were smitten by the same craze. at the first bellow of sörine's cow they had looked up inquiringly, had caught sight of the new arrivals, and at once had started off behind their leader--rosie first, then kjersti's brindlesides--both rearing their tails on high and galloping straight toward the camp of the indians.

. . . "damn the luck!" muttered per hansa between his teeth. "there goes the milk for our porridge! . . . the devil salt and burn their blasted tails!"

a far-away "moo-o-o" drifted in from the north, and there the solum boys' daisy came running at full speed, to join the deserters!1

 

1 the cattle of the first settlers, from the wandering habits they had formed during the outward journey,

 had to be watched, for they wanted to join every caravan that came along.

 

at that per hansa burst into a loud laugh. . . . "you'd better go after your cow," he said to sam, "unless you want to munch dry porridge all winter!"

the women took the matter each in her own way, according to her feeling for her particular cow. kjersti wept and took on, vowing that this was the worst thing that had ever happened to her--it was just awful; sörine's eyes were moist, but she believed that her cow would come back, just the same; she had never seen a better cow than dolly and had tended her like a mother. . . . but beret remained quite calm; she seemed more annoyed than frightened. why didn't one of the men go after the cows? . . . when they remained sitting and made no move, she rose and laid her spoon aside.

"we must get them

at once," she announced, firmly. "if the indians were to leave to-night, the cows would follow--that is perfectly plain!" . . . she took and-ongen in her arms and started for the hill.

"good heavens, beret," cried kjersti in despair. "you must be crazy!"

per hansa gazed fondly at his wife; across his face came a light that almost made him handsome. . . . there was a woman for you! . . . he got up before she had gone many steps, and ran to her side.

"go back and eat, beret-girl! there isn't anything to worry about, really and truly. . . . leave the cows to me. it can just as well wait till after we have eaten. . . . we must behave like well-mannered folk, you know."

as they sat over the last of their porridge

day clothes; for some reason, this pleased him. when she stepped within the circle of the camp fire, she paused, greeted the strangers quietly, and dropped a curtsy.

"what do you think you are doing here?" she asked in a low voice; the words seemed to carry more of reproach than fear. . . . he suddenly remembered the incident at supper awhile ago; the wave of bitterness rose again in his heart. . . . what a silly question for a grown woman to ask!

when she received no answer, she continued:

"kjersti is crying her eyes out--and the rest aren't much better off. . . . these people have got to look after themselves! you must come home at once!"

per hansa still remained silent. . . . this speech was so unlike the beret that he knew, that he glanced up at her quickly.

"give me that kettle! . . . yes--water, water?" he shouted at them, pointing to the kettle. but then he remembered store-hans. . . . "tell them that i want clean water--yes, clean, that's it! and it must be hot, too!"

now he fou

nd time to turn to his wife. . . . "oh, well, kjersti isn't going to miscarry to-night! . . . but if you don't want to stay here, to help save a human life in dire distress, you'd better go home. . . . here, give me the rest of the things!" her words of an hour before were again ringing loud in his ears; his own voice had taken on an added harshness; he knew it and felt glad.

beret said no more; she stood looking silently at him, flushed and confused.

the kettle had now been placed on the fire.

"where is the salt? . . . we need salt in the wate

he had finally yielded, on condition that they both sign their names as security for the plow and the rake. . . . by this time, anyway, he knew they were going to buy so much from him that it wouldn't have paid him to be unreasonable.

the returned voyagers, however, thought that the folks at home had stranger tales than their own to tell. it seemed nothing short of a miracle that per hansa had been able to bring back to life an indian chief with one foot in the grave--those were the very words kjersti had used to her husband. tönseten swore that he had never heard anything so strange; by george! it was more exciting than any storybook ever written!

. . . "i declare, per hansa," said hans olsa, looking at him in open admiration, "it's a queer thing about you! no matter how hard you're put to it, you always give a good account of yourself! . . . i was dead set on having you go along with us this trip; we could have arranged it somehow, you know. syvert and i were speaking about it only the n

d carrying on, you know. . . . and just then it crossed my mind, hans olsa, that if you were only near enough to sing out to--and you, too, syvert--i'd gladly have given my right hand, or both of them!"

"sam wasn't much use to you, eh?" asked tönseten.

"no, syvert, sam isn't quite equal to such a job." but then per hansa felt that he had been too harsh; he quickly added: "let's hope that he, too, will have guts some day. . . . the boy has plenty of good qualities. . . ."

meanwhile beret and kjersti had arrived; the solum boys turned up at last, and then they were all gathered. the women had gone with sörine into her new house; they were curious to see what her husband had brought; she had to give both of them a taste from this bag and that. the menfolk remained sitting behind the barn; they had many weighty matters to discuss, and didn't want to be interrupted; just now the hay cutting seemed to be the all-absorbing topic. . . . per hansa's boys and hans olsa's girl were chasing one anot

now, before you leave to-night."

"right you are! . . . yes, right you are!" agreed tönseten, solemnly, and emptied the glass without more ado.

sörine treated them all. . . . and now the menfolk were sorry, but they really had no time to stay indoors; hans olsa needed all their help to get that window in before it came dark; and out they trooped in a body again, as soon as they had emptied their glasses. when the celebration was over and they finally set out for home that night, it seemed to kjersti that syvert walked very queerly. no matter how she adjusted her own steps, he would either range ahead of her or lag behind; when the latter took place, he would suddenly discover it and lurch forward, struggling hard to keep his balance; once he had caught up with her again, he would come to a stop and stand there babbling.

"what in the name of common sense are you mumbling about? what ails you, syvert dear? . . . you act as if you were walking and talking in your sleep on the open prairie!"

"hie! . . . don't know!" he sighed. . . . "feel aw-right . . . maybe li'l' queer. . . . sort o' diz' . . . sort o' dizzy, y' know. . . . feet don't work proply!" he lurched ahead like a boat scudding down the slope of a wave. . . . "you know, i think . . . abs'lutely i do . . . must be that stuff . . . that damned stuff of sörrina's!"

"oh, well," said kjersti, consolingly, laughing to herself, "if it isn't anything worse than that, you'll soon be all right again."

it was two days later that the great misfortune befell them. and according to the manner of such events, it came while everything seemed safe and serene and even the thought of ill luck was far away.

they had finished their afternoon lunch. hans olsa was cutting hay; his new machine hummed lustily over the prairie, shearing the grass so evenly and so close to the ground that

 but now that the thatch was on, the low tone in which she naturally spoke didn't carry through the thickness of the sod; he missed hearing her, and liked to make her shout now and then. . . . he seemed to notice that she was growing better satisfied with things as they were out here.

henry solum was digging a well down by the creek. everyone was busy with his own particular task; the little frontier settlement hummed with the keen joy of labour.

. . . then the blow fell upon them--suddenly!

kjersti noticed it first. at lunch time she had brought out a bite to eat and a drop of coffee for the men. plenty reigned just now, after the trip to town. as she was about to enter her own house again it occurred to her that she hadn't seen brindlesides, either on the way over or on the way back. . . . the cow must have been in sight, somewhere around. she turned and walked a little way beyond the corner of the house, then stopped and surveyed the scene. . . . kjersti kept on looking until her eyes w

eavy pounding of her heart; but her cow was not to be seen on the whole wide prairie . . . and not a single one of the other critters, either!

in her wild excitement she ran straight to sörine's and rushed into the house, crying:

"have you any idea where your cow is?"

"my cow . . . ?" sörine noticed her agitated face, and could not say another word.

"that's just what i said, sörrina! . . . where is she--where is she? . . . oh, merciful heaven!" . . .

"you are scaring the life out of me, kjersti! the cow must be right around here." . . . but she didn't wait for an answer; the women rushed out of the house together.

. . . sure enough, no cows in sight anywhere!

"i can't understand it!" exclaimed sörine. . . . "can you?"

"they've run away!" cried kjersti is despair.

"of course they couldn't have sunk through the earth!" sörine was always a sensible woman in a crisis.

"oh, where are they?" wailed kjersti. "where have they gone?"

"we must tell the men this minute!" declared sörine

, firmly. she saw that it was no use to waste time in waiting for her neighbour, leaving kjersti to look after herself, she hastened over to where her husband was working.

hans olsa pulled up the horses abruptly when he saw the two women straggling across the field.

. . . the cows? oh, nothing worse than that! . . . well, he hadn't seen hide nor hair of the cows; but they must be around somewhere. . . . he was in such spirits because of the smooth way the new machine was running, and of the ease with which they would now be able to get all the hay they needed, that he felt as if nothing

 women were. good lord! the cows would show up all right at milking time!

"we must begin to search for them at once!" . . . sörine was so earnest and determined about it, that almost unconsciously he found himself looking around. . . . strange, not a beast to be seen! . . . then he, too, became serious; he unhitched the horses, tied one of them to the mowing machine, mounted the other, and rode up the hill.

"we must go and tell per hansa!" said sörine, briskly.

"oh, what's the use!" wailed kjersti, wringing her hands. "you can see for yourself that they are gone! . . . yes, gone--and if anyone is to find them, we'll have to do it!"

sörine was now both angry and frightened--angry with kjersti, frightened over the cows. she hurried on ahead, the other trailing after.

but there was no information to be had at per hansa's either. none of them there had thought of keeping an eye on the cows; the animals had gone around loose every day, and had invariably come home at milking time in the ev

iced the cattle away; for where could they find the indians, or how could they recover the cattle after they had been found? if they had stolen them, they meant to keep them--and keep them they could.

tönseten marched straight up to per hansa; he spoke rapidly, in a voice of great determination:

"if that's the case, by god! you've got to go and get the cows the first thing in the morning--you who are so friendly with the indians. . . . we must have our cows right away!"

"yes, good heavens!" kjersti put it. "how can we get along if that drop of milk is taken away from us? . . . you ought to go this very minute!"

per hansa sat gazing steadily off into the distance; but he said never a word. at kjersti's remark, however, it seemed as if something had suddenly stung him; he bounded up from the ground like a rubber ball.

"that's just the job for you and sam! . . . come on, wife, let's go home and get to bed."

with these words he stalked away; everyone could see that now per hansa was thorou

wn, lifeless sea; the sombre greyness rose and covered him.

 

soon the word was passed around that per hansa had set out eastward to the sioux river, to look for the cattle; everyone was willing to let the matter rest at that. his pony was fleet-footed; there was no need for any of the others to take up the search; they had better wait to see what luck he had. . . . not that tönseten had any faith or hope in the trip. he had kept turning the matter over in his mind all night; he had got from kjersti a detailed account of how the cattle had behaved when the indians came, and when he had risen that morning he had been fully convinced that sam's solution of the riddle was the right and only one. to tönseten's mind, all that remained of the problem was how to get hold of the beasts again without causing bloodshed and war--how to wrest them from the possession of the redskins before they had gobbled them all up. . . . when he heard of per hansa's intended visit to the trönders, he spluttered

on the sioux river? the man had better be made to understand that they needed their cows at once! . . . tönseten went about breathing fire and brimstone, and didn't care who heard him.

the gloom of this loss lay heavy upon the others as well; they went about their work as usual, but their eyes strayed elsewhere.

evening came, but neither per hansa nor the cattle. folks did not care to go to bed; they sat about staring and waiting. all of hans olsa's family went over to beret's; tönseten and kjersti, having first stopped at hans olsa's and found them out, went there, too. the solum boys could see no reason for moping around their hut alone; they soon joined the others. . . . but none of them found cheer in this place, either. beret seemed distant and strangely calm, as if the whole affair didn't in the least concern her. they wondered at her manner, it was so unnatural.

when they were leaving, however, she said, quietly, as if musing to herself:

"somehow, i can't figure this out. . . . n

"

per hansa pretended not to hear; he dismounted and threw the bridle to store-hans. . . . "water him now, and feed him well! . . . where did i pick that fellow up? oh, i beguiled a kind trönder woman into letting me take him for a year. i promised her ten dollars into the bargain; that makes exactly two dollars and a half for your share, syvert. but that'll be cheaper for you in the long run, you see, than to chase up and down the whole of dakota territory looking for your cow!"

sörine and kjersti were both very outspoken in their gratitude to per hansa; they plainly meant every word that they said. but it seemed to per hansa that the deepest word of wisdom on this occasion was offered by kjersti. she stood listening patiently until the story of his long ride had come to an end; then she remarked, as if quietly musing:

"when lust can be so strong in a dumb brute, what mustn't it be in a human being! . . . i shall never forget this trick you have turned, per hansa!"

rding to his own traits and peculiarities; but with all it was a new incentive to let their eyes scan the prairie. they had always done this, of course; but more often it had been with the object of straightening their tired backs for a moment, than to seek for actual traces of wandering fellow beings. . . . this visit had encouraged them all, but tönseten and his wife were especially firm and optimistic in their faith; from now on syvert always spoke of the future with fervent conviction, and kjersti went about listening to him in a glow of silent but none the less ardent devotion. the solum boys also had little doubt of the omen--this wagon was only the forerunner of more to come! the next in order of enthusiasm was sörine, to whom faith imparted a glad calmness. hans olsa let every day be sufficient unto itself, enjoyed the confident spirits of the others, and set himself every day to accomplish something needful; he was not a fast worker, but got things done with a peculiar sureness of

 window as he passed. tönseten was standing outside when he arrived there; the caravan lay some distance off to the southward, steering too far west to fetch the settlement.

"you're going to have visitors," per hansa greeted his neighbour.

"it looks that way!" chuckled tönseten. . . . "though i'm afraid they're heading a little too far west."

they stood gazing at the train of wagons, now less than a hundred yards away; through the dusk they could just make out the forms of the men driving. kjersti stood behind them in the door, laughing to herself and wondering how she could put them all up for the night. . . . oh, well, if it couldn't be arranged here, per hansa would have to take some of them home to his place.

. . . "i wonder what kind of people they are?" tönseten mused. . . . "are they going to pass right by an open door?"

"that's just what they're doing!" said per hansa, curtly, fearing that now the trolls were upon them.

"but surely they can see us?"

"they ought to, if they h

ave eyes!"

the caravan had now drawn abreast of them to the southwest; it was so near that they could hear the panting of the horses; then the foremost wagon swung off a trifle and took a more westerly course; they evidently had no intention of camping here for the night.

"you'd better go over and talk to them, syvert," said kjersti. . . . "we'll make room for them somehow."

tönseten gazed at them open-mouthed; tears of disappointment stood in his eyes. . . . "that's a fine way to act!" he spluttered. . . . "hadn't we better go over and invite them?"

per hansa's eyes flashed daggers; his face lighted up with irresistible forcefulness. . . . "we won't bother about that just yet. . . . they might be high-toned, you know--heading for hans olsa's place, or mine!"

the train moved slowly on toward the northwest, until it was

unhitched; the newcomers had evidently decided to pitch their camp for the night.

. . . "it's the strangest thing i ever saw!" said tönseten, as if speaking to himself. "can you imagine anyone coming into a neighbourhood where the houses are standing around as thick as fleas on a dog's back, and not even wanting to talk to the folks who live in 'em? . . . i call it a damned outrage! what's the matter--are they afraid of us?"

"it doesn't seem as if they can really be civilized people!" put in kjersti.

"most likely they've got some nice-looking girls aboard, and are afraid the place is full of knock-about single men!" per hansa explained, calmly.

the three puzzled folks stood there watching and wondering; through the deepening dusk they couldn't make out clearly what the strangers were doing. . . . apparently they were building a fire down on the slope; a glare of flames intermittently rose and spread, waned and reappeared; it seemed to flit back and forth on the ground.

"do you know what

can't use either the 'catechism' or the 'epitome'; they don't live according to the scriptures!" . . .

tönseten drew a long and heavy sigh. . . . "my god! what troubles a man may fall into! . . . it makes me shudder to think how wild they talked!"

when they parted it was agreed that all the menfolk should meet early next morning, to counsel together as to what must be done. per hansa was to notify hans olsa and the solum boys, and bring all three over to tonseten's.

"don't breathe a word to kjersti about how things are!" per hansa warned him. . . . "if the women ever get hold of this, they'll die of fright! . . . we'll find a way out somehow--i tell you we will!"

as he walked homeward per hansa was a totally different man from the one who had gone over to tönseten's a couple of hours before. then he had carried a heavy burden of worry and care; but now he walked with a lightsome, buoyant step, very well pleased with the turn events had taken. his mood lightened and brightene

s, with tönseten as an interpreter. . . . per hansa hardly knew which way to turn; he looked at sörine's face, and again, as so often before, was impressed by the goodness and intelligence in it; then he made up his mind and related frankly the whole experience which had befallen him and tönseten the night before.

. . . "now, sörrina, i know you are a sensible woman and will keep your mouth shut," he added, quickly, when he was through. "beret doesn't know anything about this, neither does kjersti; there's no need of alarming folks who are in a bad way already. . . . not that we need to worry over this business; i'm sure they'll take it peaceably when we show them our papers. . . . now we must hurry. get your deed, hans olsa!"

but it was a sheer impossibility for hans olsa to hurry in a matter of this kind; he had to ask about it over and over again. facts were facts, which in this case were clear beyond questioning: he himself had gone to the land office in person; tönseten had put hi

sits to them during the next few days; before the third day was over, he had sold them more than ten dollars' worth of potatoes; he felt that he had struck up a profitable business.

 

the irish finally settled on these two quarters west of them. they returned east to iowa just before the snow fell in the fall; but early the following spring they came back with a large company, and started their permanent settlement.

on the morning when the men had gone out to parley with the irish, kjersti was left all alone in the house. she felt gloomy and depressed; there had been little or no sleep for either of them during the night; syvert had tossed to and fro in bed, telling and retelling the same unhappy story--of the terrible folks who had come, of what they proposed to do, and of the dreary future that awaited him and hans olsa, who would now be forced to start everything anew. . . . perhaps they had better just move east again, and be done with it! he had lain twisting and turning as

, at any rate! and at the worst, these were white people, thank the lord! . . .

all this and more she had said to syvert; every word of it had been well meant and fully considered. but he had grown angry and had accused her of not having a particle of common sense; then one word had led to another. when the quarrel had finally worn itself out they had found themselves at opposite ends of the earth, though lying side by side in the same bed.

it was lonesome after the men had left that morning; kjersti kept the coffeepot on the stove, and laid on a couple of fresh sticks of wood; he would be sure to look in for a drop when he came back! . . . then she put on syvert's old hat and went over to see beret; she wanted to find out what per hansa had told her when he came home the night before.

she got little information or comfort there, however. . . . first she recounted most of what tönseten had let out to her--that people had arrived who claimed to own hans olsa's land, as well as his own; tha

t these people wouldn't listen to reason, so in all probability they would have to seek the aid of the law. . . . hadn't per hansa told her what had happened?

the boys were eating their breakfast; beret sat over by the stove, dressing the child; she made no answer to kjersti; her face flushed but she did not look up.

ole, however, laughingly began to repeat some of the crazy stories his father had told them the night before; store-hans remembered more of them, and helped his brother out when his memory failed; the boys were still highly excited, and kept on making such a noise and chatter that kjersti threw up her hands, begging them for the lord's sake to be quiet! . . .

beret listened in a rigid, frozen silence; she let the boys say anything they wanted to, as

s land--and now he was going to drive them away! . . . good god! could this be possible? . . .

but at last the boys went so far that she had to interfere; they had begun to laugh together in a coarse, bold way, and use evil words. . . . how truly it is said, she thought, that the seed which is sown in secret bears fruit openly! . . . with the child in her arms, she got up decisively, crossed the room, and flashed out at the boys; she was very stern now, and scolded them harshly.

all the while kjersti had been growing more disturbed; she had to find consolation somewhere, and said, as if trying to bolster herself up:

"this can't be anything to worry about! why, we have been given this quarter, and were the first to arrive here!"

"what about per hansa's land?" asked beret.

"it seems they don't intend to claim that, according to what syvert says. . . . i don't know why!"

"probably nothing can be done about it," said beret, quietly. "there is no telling who may have been wandering around ou

t here before we came. . . . many may have been here."

this aimless talk only irritated kjersti.

"i should think they would keep all that straightened out--the people whose business it is to look after such things! if syvert weren't such a milksop of a man, he would have gone after the sheriff at once. . . . folks are put in prison for such deeds in america!"

beret was silent for a moment; she bent over the child, while a deep flush slowly covered her face; then she said in a low voice:

"the guilty will receive their punishment in the end!" . . . as soon as she had spoken, she got up a

nd left the house abruptly; outside, she put down the child, and stood like a stone image looking westward; there she remained standing until kjersti came out.

"i see them coming now," she said, as the other appeared.

at that, kjersti had to hurry off home, to get the breakfast for syvert.

but tönseten had returned long before the others; he was in bed when she came in; though the fall day was mild, he had covered himself up with the heavy blanket. at first she couldn't get a word out of him; she thought he must be ill, especially as he refused the coffee which she poured out for him. . . . they can't possibly have done him an injury? she thought. she began plying him with questions, and kept on until he finally admitted t

n all probability he would have brought the irish around all right, if per hansa and henry solum hadn't stirred them up to fight; they had done just exactly the wrong things. and so a big ruffian had rushed forward with a sledge hammer; and hans olsa had gone into a mad rage and killed the man! from now on there would be nothing but war and bloodshed; so they might as well pack up and move right away! what a tragedy it was! . . .

tönseten stayed safely in bed until late in the afternoon; then kjersti came and told him that the strangers had gone. he got up immediately to see if it was true. . . . after that he seemed quite like himself again.

for a long time the irish were the standing topic of discussion in the little settlement.

but whenever they were mentioned, beret kept silent; she took no part in the joy and relief of the others, for there were certain circumstances connected with the affair which she couldn't get out of her mind; the longer she looked at them the uglier they appear

lent folk!

at both tönseten's and hans olsa's they had noticed the strangers come and go; in the evening they all went to per hansa's to learn how the irish had behaved.

. . . "finest people in the world!" per hansa assured them, pacing the floor, uplifted by a surge of high spirits that somehow had to find an outlet. no sooner did he sit down than he was up again; his sallies of humour had a dashing quality that made them positively contagious. tönseten was in a continual gale of hilarity; kjersti and sörine, who sat on the big bed with their knitting, had to let their work drop at intervals to laugh at syvert's and per hansa's extravagances. beret had just laid the child in the other bed, and was sitting beside her on the edge; both boys were listening eagerly to the talk of their elders.

that evening per hansa told them all about the stakes; of how he had found them, of what he had thought, and of the way he had finally disposed of them. he related the story in a loud voice, with boi

sterous, care-free zest; he made it sound exactly like a fairy tale. . . . many words of praise were bestowed on his wise action; tönseten was especially effusive--there was a neighbour for you! as for kjersti, she was moved almost to tears over such a man. what a difference from that spineless jellyfish of a husband of hers!

"i'll have to admit," said hans olsa, soberly, "that you played a risky game; and it was the hand of the lord that kept you from telling. for if they had been able to show that their stakes had ever been on my land, we'd probably be building a new house now, somewhere out to the westward. all our work this summer would have been for others. . . . my thanks to you, per hansa!"

a far away at the sioux river! . . . here was a fine mess, indeed!

then store-hans came galloping in, and told a story so strange that all were lost in amazement.

"they are norskies!" he shouted as he pulled up.

"what's that you say?" exclaimed tönseten.

"yes, norskies, every single one, i tell you! a whole shoal of them--and they are coming right here! they talk norwegian, too."

"are you crazy!" shouted tönseten. . . . at once he began to assume a great dignity and authority; he ordered kjersti indoors to put on the coffeepot, and sent the other women to help her. . . . "don't you hear hans say that they are norskies! decent folks must get a decent reception!"

and now he took sam with him, and did like the patriarch of old: he went out to meet the strangers, entreating them to enter in under his humble roof.

a great event, indeed! the company consisted of five wagons and the same number of horse teams; they were good horses, too--tönseten could see that they were in fine condition.

they camped in the yard in front of tönseten's house. when he discovered how many they were he said no more about coffee; but he brought them potatoes and other vegetables, and generously shared the evening milk with them. he would not hear of their sleeping in the open that night . . . stay outside, he shouted, when they had come to norwegians who owned a new-built house? that would never, never do! . . . at turning-in time, he and kjersti crawled into bed first; then the floor space was packed with as many of the strangers as it would accommodate, the rest seeking shelter in the barn.

tönseten didn't get much rest that night; the worst of it was that he couldn't talk to kjersti, at a time when he so sorely needed her counsel. . . . good god! how could he sleep, with this tremendous responsibility suddenly thrust upon him? a whole settlement of norwegians snoring right in front of his bed! . . . fine people, excellent people, e

 luck!--that per hansa should be far away on the sioux river at this important moment! . . . if he could only persuade them to settle here, the future would be secure for both himself and his neighbours. . . . yes, let him bring that about, and things would look so bright that he could turn over in bed and drop asleep every night with a thankful heart!

. . . he ought to start out right now, and get per hansa, who had such a wonderfully persuasive gift of tongue. but he couldn't discuss it with kjersti; neither could he see any way to get out of the house; men lay snoring side by side, from the edge of the bed clear over to the door! . . .

when all the strangers finally left the room in the morning, so that he and kjersti could get out of bed, tönseten felt as if he hadn't slept a wink all night; he realized full well that now he rose to confront his day of days.

he had no time to eat breakfast--he hardly noticed kjersti when she called him; already he was deep in conversation with the wes

 followed after? . . . what then? . . .

the strangers listened seriously to him; they were forced to admit that there was a good deal of common sense in what he said.

the party did not get back to camp until late in the afternoon. then they cooked a substantial meal from the potatoes which tönseten had given them; after that they held council; the majority were for settling down right here.

when tönseten heard the decision, he gave an excited laugh; he ran hurriedly into the house and told kjersti, who wept over the news; the next instant he had bounced out again. he felt now that destiny had used him as her tool. he had only reached out his hand, and, lo! he had brought in twenty neighbours with a single stroke--norwegians, every last mother's son of them! . . . this good fortune seemed so overwhelming, it had befallen him so suddenly, that he wasn't willing to trust it too far. . . . when the strangers hitched up their horses and crossed the creek--they had decided to settle on the eas

; per hansa ordered such an unreasonable quantity of it, and still he wondered if it wouldn't be too little! . . . lord! there was no limit to all the things per hansa thought he must have; but his money soon ran out and that put an end to the trading.

at last they were ready to leave.

"aren't we going to have a single drop on this trip?" hans olsa mused aloud.

"there you said something!" exclaimed per hansa. "that reminds me--i was to get three bottles for syvert! but not a word about it to kjersti--bear that in mind when we get home. . . . he's going to use it as liniment for his rheumatism, you know!"

the trader treated them all around before he filled the bottles. henry got two bottles for himself, and one for his brother; hans olsa had brought along his sunday bottle to be filled; as that would hardly be enough he bought a smaller one, which he put in his pocket; per hansa got two for himself, and three for tönseten. . . . when the trader had filled all their orders he felt that he

often when he spoke to her she was not there; she neither saw nor heard him, said only yes and no, which seemed to come from far away. . . . probably she was brooding over the strange thing about to happen, store-hans told himself; he often looked wonderingly at her, thinking many thoughts beyond his years. . . . he remembered his father's words, and never left her for long, although it was very lonesome for him in the house.

a couple of days after the men's departure, she sent the boy over to kjersti to borrow a darning needle; she had hidden her own away so carefully that she could not find it. such things occurred commonly now; she would put something away, she could not remember where, and would potter around looking for it without really searching; at last, she would forget altogether what she was about, and would sit down with a peculiarly vacant look on her face; at such times she seemed like a stranger. . . . ole was sitting in the house that morning, finishing a sling-shot which he

had just made.

suddenly store-hans came darting back with the needle; he had run until he was all out of breath. he burst out with the strangest news, of tönseten's having killed a big animal; it was awfully big--almost like a bear! . . . tönseten said it was a bear, so it must be true! tönseten and kjersti were skinning him right now; kjersti had told him that if he would bring a pail, they could have fresh meat for supper. both boys immediately began pleading for permission to go and see the animal; their mother scarcely answered; she gave them a pail and asked them not to stay long.

the boys came running down the hill just as kjersti was cutting up the carcass; tönseten was struggling with the hide, trying to stretch it on the barn door; his mouth bristled with nails, his hands were bloody--he was a frightful spectacle!

"what's

t old bar i'd tackle either a tiger or a rhinoceros!"

"what became of the old she-bear?" ole asked, falling under the spell of tönseten's enthusiasm.

"she went north across the prairie, lickety-split! . . . come here, now--take some of these chunks of meat home with you. . . . this will make delicious stew, let me tell you!"

"is it fit to eat?" asked store-hans, still doubting.

"fit to eat? no finer meat to be found than bear meat--don't you know that?"

the boys followed him over to where kjersti was still cutting up the animal; it must have been a large carcass, for the cut meat made a sizable heap.

"is it . . . is it really bear?" asked ole, in a more humble tone.

"he's meaty enough for it! . . . here, give me the pail; beret needs some good, strengthening food. . . . maybe you'll take a little to sörrina, too; you can stop in with it on the way. . . . careful--don't spill it, now!"

the boys loitered along on the way home; from time to time they had to put down the pail, in order

ly with some remark that they could only wonder at; they hardly knew whether to be surprised or offended.

but on the day when the boys carried a gift of ducks to all the houses in the neighbourhood, proud of the dainty food they brought, and relating what sounded like a fairy tale, everyone went over to per hansa's to learn how he had gone about catching these birds. for ole and store-hans wouldn't tell, though they plied them with questions. . . . the solum boys came first, with tönseten and kjersti hard upon their heels; last of all came hans olsa and sörine.

once inside, they completely forgot their curiosity about the duck hunting; they stood with their mouths open, looking up one wall and down the next.

. . . why . . . why . . . what in the wide world was this? had they plastered snow on the walls? sam thought it really was snow, and touched it gingerly with his finger. . . . what was it, anyway? could it possibly be paint? . . . my stars, how fine it looked! . . . per hansa sat the

amazement was universal. . . . sörine smiled in her pleasant, kindly way; she went over to beret and said with warm sympathy:

"now you certainly have got a fine house! . . . you'll thrive all the better for it." . . . at that, she began to help her with the work. but kjersti, with an emphatic slap on her thigh, voiced it as her opinion that it was a dirty shame that she and sörrina had picked up such poor sticks for husbands! why couldn't they ever hatch up some nice scheme? why was per hansa the only man among them with his head on the right end? yes, they certainly ought to feel ashamed of themselves, sitting there! . . . tönseten took offence at this; he felt constrained to remind her that he was the fellow who had risen to the occasion and captured the sognin

 night. . . . snow flew . . . more snow fell.

no sun. . . . no sky. . . . the air was a grey, ashen mist which breathed a deathly chill; it hung around and above them thick and frozen. . . . in the course of time there was a full moon at night, somewhere behind the veil. then the mist grew luminous and alive--strange to behold. . . . night after night the ghostly spectacle would return.

per hansa would gaze at it and think: now the trolls are surely abroad! . . .

 

one evening tönseten and kjersti came over. they sat and talked until it grew very late. one could readily see that syvert was out of sorts about something; he puffed at his pipe in glum, ill humor, glared at per hansa's walls, and didn't have much to say. when he did speak his voice was unnecessarily loud.

kjersti and beret sat together on the bed; they seemed to be finding a good deal to chat about.

kjersti was in an unusually neighbourly mood; she had come over to ask if . . . well, if she couldn't do something for beret?

 very finest! beret must just try to imagine how lonesome she was, sitting at home all alone with that useless husband of hers--and no little newcomer to wait for! . . . she had plenty of yarn; she could easily make the socks long enough to serve as leggings, too. the work would really bring joy to her--and to syvert, too, poor fellow, to whom no little newcomer would ever arrive!

. . . ah, well! . . . god pity us, syvert wasn't so bad, after all--far be it from her to complain! . . . at that, kjersti happened to think of a story she had heard, about a couple who couldn't seem to get a child though they wanted one very badly. here the story was, since they happened to be talking about such matters. . . . this wife had so little sense that she sought the aid of a witch woman, who gave her both devil's drink and beaver-geld; she rubbed herself with the stuff and drank some of it, too, but no change came; that is, not until one summer when a shoal of herring came into the fjord and with it a fl

at a queer thing? . . . but when the boy was a year old and was on the point of being christened--well, on that very sunday it happened, as they were sailing across the fjord, that the boat capsized and the lord took both mother and child, right there and then! he had taken away what he had refused to give in honour, and more besides. . . . there was something mysterious about such things, didn't beret think so? and wasn't it strange that the father should have been so fond of that child? . . . kjersti had known them both very well.

beret listened attentively to this tale, putting in a word here and there.

over at the table, the men had pricked up their ears as the story began; they heard it all. per hansa looked at syvert and laughed; syvert, in turn, glared at the wall and said, angrily:

"i should think you'd be able to find something american to talk about! . . . we're through now with all that troll business over in norway!" . . . he got up and started to go. . . .

thing going on? sörine asked.

--no, not exactly that--though it must be nearly time now. but sörine ought to remember that it was pretty lonesome for her, sitting there alone, unable even to go outside the door. day after day beret neither saw nor heard another person, outside of the family!

--yes, certainly--she would be glad to run over!

--could she go right away?

--was there such an awful hurry?--sörine still suspected per hansa's denial. if that was the case, he had better go and get kjersti at once; she didn't care to tackle this job alone!

--no, no--it wasn't that!

sörine went in for a moment to put on her coat; soon she came out again, ready to start. he went with her for some distance. . . .

--wasn't he coming along?--she asked, stopping to look inquiringly at him.

--no, he guessed he wouldn't; he needed to have a little talk with hans olsa to-night. he only wanted to say this: that she who understood all such things so capably, must look well to beret now; she mustn't com

he had barely entered hans olsa's house, found a seat, and lighted his pipe, when another visitor arrived. tonseten came in, apparently in a bad humour; no, he didn't want to sit down; he was going farther on in a minute or two. did they know that the solum boys were about to leave?

"i guess we know as much as you do," said per hansa, dryly. . . . "there's such a lot going on around here these days!"

"but this won't do, folks, i tell you--it simply won't do! as kjersti says, soon we'll have nothing but the snow left!"

"and i hope that'll go in time, too," laughed per hansa.

"it probably will!" tönseten snapped, irritably. "but what i don't understand is, why have you folks let things come to such a pass?"

"we . . . ?" per hansa asked.

"yes, you! . . . the two of you!"

"we can't very well tie up the boys, when they are bent on going," said hans olsa.

"i didn't say we could!" . . . tönseten stood in front of him, waving his arms excitedly. "but we can u

"it strikes me this way," said hans olsa, slowly. "if they have made up their minds, it isn't right for us to interfere."

"made up their minds!" snorted tönseten, contemptuously. "what nonsense you're talking, hans olsa! how many times have you made up your mind, i'd like to know, and then unmade it again? . . . i can assure you of one thing, fellows: if we let sam and henry slip away from us now, it's certainly doubtful if we ever see them again--single and unhitched as they are! that's just kjersti's opinion, too. then won't we be left in a fine mess, i ask you--for what chance would we stand of ever getting such good neighbours again?"

"we might try it," hans olsa conceded. "what do you think, per hansa?"

per hansa jumped up from his chair. "i'll do whatever you say, friends. we can get no worse than a refusal." . . . but then he remembered something, and hesitated for a moment. . . . "i really oughtn't to be going over there; but--oh, well! who cares!" he grabbed up his cap impulsivel

hans olsa announced their errand.

at this henry burst out laughing. . . . no, a schoolteacher he could never be, he said; he had other things to think of; back east in minnesota somewhere, a girl was straying about looking for him; if he could only find her, he too would be needing a teacher by and by! . . .

then tönseten began to talk; there was a note in his voice that put all joking aside, even though they had to laugh at him now and then:

"if you leave this place, you'll have to take kjersti and me along with you, though i don't know what we would do with ourselves back in minnesota! she and i crossed the red sea, as it were, when we left last spring. . . . for her and me there is no road leading back! . . . what do you think we're going to do, i'd like to know, when you are gone? at hans olsa's they don't play cards; and per hansa, poor devil--well, he has a sick woman on his hands. . . . god alone knows how that business is going to come off. that's just what kjersti says, too!"

weather, and dry, powdery snow. . . . murk without, and leaden dusk in the huts. people sat oppressed in the sombre gloom.

. . . things were in a bad way over at per hansa's now; everyone knew it and feared what might befall both beret and him. . . . no one could help; all that could be done was to bide the time; for soon a change must come!

"listen, folks," said tönseten, trying to comfort them as best he could. "beret can't keep this up forever! i think you had better go over to her again, kjersti!"

both neighbour women were now taking turns at staying with her, each one a day at a time. they saw clearly that per hansa was more in need of help than beret; there was no helping her now, while something, at least, could be done for him and the children. christmas would soon be here, too, and the house ought to be made comfortable and cosy!

they all felt very sorry for per hansa. he walked about like a ragged stray dog; his eyes burned with a hunted look. each day, the children were sent o

fought his way through many a hard fight, but they had all been as nothing compared with this. he had ridden the frail keel of a capsized boat on the lofoten seas, had seen the huge, combing waves snatch away his comrades one by one, and had rejoiced in the thought that the end would soon come for him also; but things of that sort had been mere child's play. . . . this was the uttermost darkness. here was neither beginning nor end--only an awful void in which he groped alone. . . .

sörine and kjersti had both arrived a long time since. when they had come he had put on his coat and gone outside; but he hadn't been able to tear himself many steps away from the house.

now it was evening; he had wandered into the stable to milk rosie, forgetting that she had gone dry long ago; he had tended to injun and the oxen, without knowing what he was about. . . . he listened to beret wailing in the other room, and his heart shrivelled; thus a weak human being could not continue to suffer, and yet live.

he stood in the door of the stable, completely undone. just then kjersti ran out to find him; he must come in at once; beret was asking for him! . . . kjersti was gone in a flash. . . . he entered the house, took off his outdoor clothes, and washed his hands. . . .

. . . beret sat half dressed on the edge of the bed. he looked at her, and thought that he had never seen such terror on any face. . . . god in heaven--this was beyond human endurance!

she was fully rational, and asked the neighbour women to leave the room for a moment, as she had something to say to her husband. she spoke with great composure; they obeyed immediately. when the door clos

when he had freed himself, she spoke brokenly, between gasps:

. . . "to-night i am leaving you. . . . yes, i must leave you. . . . i know this is the end! the lord has found me out because of my sins. . . . it is written, 'to fall into the hands of the living god!' . . . oh!--it is terrible! . . . i can't see how you will get along when you are left alone . . . though i have only been a burden to you lately. . . . you had better give and-ongen to kjersti . . . she wants a child so badly--she is a kind woman. . . . you must take the boys with you--and go away from here! . . . how lonesome it will be for me . . . to lie here all alone!"

tears came to her eyes, but she did not weep; between moans she went on strongly and collectedly:

"but promise me one thing: put me away in the big chest! . . . i have emptied it and made it ready. . . . promise to lay me away in the big chest, per hansa! . . . and you must be sure to dig the grave deep! . . . y

. . . a door opened somewhere; a gleam of light flashed across the snow, and vanished. some one came out of the hut quietly--then stopped, as if searching.

"per hansa!" a low voice called. . . . "per hansa, where are you?" . . . he rose and staggered toward kjersti like a drunken man.

"you must come in at once!" she whispered, and hurried in before him.

the light was dim in there; nevertheless it blinded him so strongly that he could not see a thing. he stood a moment leaning against the door until his eyes had grown accustomed to it. . . . a snug, cosy warmth enveloped him; it carried with it an odd, pleasant odour. the light, the warmth, and the pleasant smell overcame him like sweet sleep that holds a person who has been roused, but who does not care

 to awaken just yet.

"how is it?" he heard a man's voice ask. then he came back to his senses. . . . was that he himself speaking? . . .

"you'll have to ask sörrina," kjersti answered.

sörine was tending something on the bed; not until now did he discover her--and wake up completely. . . . what was this? . . . the expression on her face? wasn't it beaming with motherly goodness and kindliness?

"yes, here's your little fellow! i have done all i know how. come and look at him. . . . it's the greatest miracle i ever saw, per hansa, that you didn't lose your wife to-night, and the child too! . . . i pray the lord i never have to suffer so!"

per hansa stood for a long time looking at his wife, hardly daring to believe what he saw. she slept peacefully; a small bundle lay beside her, from which peeped out a tiny, red, wrinkled face. . . . as he continued to gaze at her he sensed clearly that this moment was making him a better man!

at last he gathered his wits sufficiently to turn to sörine and ask:

"tell me, what sort of a fellow is this you have brought me--a boy or a girl?"

"heavens! per hansa, how silly you talk!" . . . kjersti and sörine both had to laugh as they looked at per hansa; such a foolish, simple expression they had never seen on the face of a living man! . . . but sörine immediately grew serious once more, and said that this was no time for joking; the way they had tugged and pulled at him during the night, you couldn't tell what might happen; per hansa must get the child christened right away; if he put if off, she refused to be responsible.

a puzzled expression came over the grinning face.

cross the threshold reverently. an air of sabbath had descended on the room. the sun shone brightly through the window, spreading a golden lustre over the white walls; only along the north wall, where the bed stood, a half shadow lingered. . . . the fire crackled in the stove; the coffeepot was boiling. the table had been spread with a white cover; upon it lay the open hymn book, with the page turned down. beside the hymn book stood a bowl of water; beside that lay a piece of white cloth. . . . kjersti was tending the stove, piling the wood in diligently. . . . sörine sat in the corner, crooning over a tiny bundle; out of the bundle at intervals came faint, wheezy chirrups, like the sounds that rise from a nest of young birds.

an irresistible force drew per hansa to the bed. . . . she lay sound asleep. . . . thank god, that awful look of dread had not come back! he straightened himself up and glanced around the room; never before had he seen anything that looked so beautiful. . . .

encouraged her husband. she seemed to have taken charge of the ceremony, and spoke in low, reassuring tones, as if she had done nothing else all her life but attend to such duties; and it was her confidence that gave hans olsa the courage he needed. . . . he went up to the table, took the book, and read the ritual in a trembling voice, slowly, with many pauses. and so he christened the child peder victorious, pronouncing the name clearly. whereupon he said the lord's prayer so beautifully, that kjersti exclaimed she had never heard the like.

"there, now!" said kjersti with great emphasis. "i don't believe there is a thing lacking to make this christening perfectly correct! . . . now the coffee is ready and we're all going to have a cup."

but per hansa was searching over in the corner; at last he produced a bottle. first he treated sörine; then kjersti. . . . "if ever two people have earned something good, you two are it! . . . come on, now, have another little drop! . . . and hurry up abou

per hansa thought it a splendid idea. . . . couldn't he and the neighbour women manage the work? he went over to talk to them about it. kjersti burst out laughing and offered to come for two weeks if they wanted her. sörine was delighted, too. yes, indeed, they would come, if beret would only promise to sit still and let them do all the work.

"oh, there is a way of insuring that," said per hansa, with a roguish laugh. he had held beret on his lap before now, and he was man enough to do it again. . . . "be sure you come early, all of you!"

and so they came for dinner on the thirteenth day of christmas, every one, and gathered in per

tönseten thought that per hansa had been reckless and had gone too far in giving the boy that second name. per hansa must remember that he himself was only a human being. . . . where had he been on christmas night, for instance? that was a thing tönseten would like to know! he wasn't outside, and he wasn't inside. . . . tönseten had said a good many things like this to kjersti when he had first heard about the name.

but that was one time when tönseten should have kept still! . . . kjersti had been very angry with him and let him know that it was both right and proper for an unusual child to have an unusual name. so much tönseten could stand; but what came next was harder to swallow. kjersti had talked herself into a fit of crying--all about how lonely it was to sit there month after month without ever having anything to give a name to! he was wise enough about oth

but that episode was forgotten. now they sat there rejoicing over the newcomer. they all felt themselves to be shareholders in him, but they couldn't agree over the division. . . . the boy undoubtedly belonged to beret and per hansa--that was true enough and as it should be. but it didn't follow from this that they possessed the sole and only rights in him. had not sörine and kjersti stood by while the ship sank? now, hadn't they? hadn't they been the sponsors? did not godmothers have a strong claim on their godchildren? . . . and hadn't hans olsa been called out into the cold, grey christmas morning to take upon himself the holy duties of priesthood? it was he, indeed, who had poured the baptismal water and read the words that should sound over every christian mortal! . . . all this was beyond dispute, and no one grumbled over hans olsa's prior right to the child. . . . bu

t, just the same, protested tönseten, it was hardly fair play, either to him or to the solum boys. not one of them had had a moment's peace on christmas night; they had just been kept wading back and forth in the snow, for the sake of that confounded baby. for his own part; he hadn't tasted a mouthful of food all day, and hadn't taken his trousers off all night! . . . tönseten refused to be set aside; in the midst of the company, with all his friends around him, he was less afraid of kjersti. a sudden fancy struck him--he began teasing sörine about the name. it was in his honour, of course, that the boy had been given that second name, and not in her honour at all! but tönseten should have been more careful in raising this issue. sam immediately struck in, insisting that per hansa must have taken the name from him--he had two names beginning with "s"!

henry, with an idea of eventually getting rid of his job, wanted the boy to be a schoolmaster. . . . but no, the godmothers wouldn't listen to the proposal. schoolmaster! as if that were good enough for such a boy! besides, they already had a schoolmaster. at this point kjersti lifted up her voice and announced that he should be a minister. then sörine laughed and winked at her husband. minister? . . . oh, they already had a minister, too--one of a sort; the boy had been baptized quite in the proper christian manner! . . . as far as she could see, the newcomer would have to be a doctor. but this proposal started per hansa up with a new objection. hadn't they doctors enough already, too? . . . there was kjersti, and there was sörine, and here he sat himself. why, the

hy couldn't henry teach his school just as well over there? . . . they all agreed that this was the thing to do.

but tönseten, as usual, wasn't quite satisfied with the arrangement; he felt that they weren't being entirely fair to him. so he proposed that they should move the school to his house every third week. there was plenty of food for both henry and sam. true enough, he had no children; but they should remember that he had fathered the school itself. think how lonely it was for him and kjersti to be moping in the hut all by themselves while the others every other week were enjoying company and the glory of learning! . . . why not be brotherly and share the best with the worst? . . .

again the new plan was agreed upon, and that became the final arrangement for holding the school.

there was little to do, either outdoors or indoors, during these days. often the menfolk would sit in the school both morning and afternoon, and the women made a practice of attending every afternoon. they

his incident saved the school at a critical time. but it did vastly more. that winter they learned to sing many songs. the children learned them, and the grown people learned them, too. there were hymns and national anthems; there were folk songs and war songs; and there were many, many love songs from their own nordland, with not a few swedish love ballads as well. . . . by the time the school had become itinerant, sam had acquired two good assistants; for now it appeared that both sörine and kjersti possessed in memory a goodly store of ditties. . . . everything of that nature was routed out from its hiding place and put into active use.

tönseten became at times a troublesome listener at these functions. if, as he sat there following henry's instruction, he thought that he detected heresy, or if he disliked the method of teaching, he said so without mincing words. as to pedagogical methods, tönseten was very particular. in his opinion, henry lacked the proper and necessary cunning in fo

the problem was simply senseless, laughed sofie; when there were six, there simply must be six, and no way out of it! . . .

"don't listen to him," said ole. "he's only fooling!"

"fooling!" thundered tönseten. "it seems to me that you are doing the fooling. . . . well, hansy, you will have to go at it again!"

none of the grown people had heard this riddle before. they laughed heartily and thought it great fun. kjersti's knitting sank into her lap. . . . no doubt about it. syvert was clever at asking questions!

"hans," said tönseten, sternly, "put your brains to work!"

"i--i suppose there was only one man with daughters?" submitted store-hans, carefully.

"did you ever see the like of the cleverness in that boy! . . . yes; you see, the fact of it was that the minister was a deacon in his own church. very likely there wasn't anyone else who could serve as deacon!"

"oh yes, he'll be a man, that sam, if he keeps this up!" . . . another couple came rocking past--he ought to know that fellow, if he would only stop whirling around. by god! it was tönseten, tossing along with an apple-round trönder woman! . . .

"careful now, syvert, old man! there are rocks and breakers ahead of you! what do you think kjersti would--"

"shut your mouth, per hansa! what are you standing there moping about?" tönseten's face was fiery red; the dance whirled him away before he had time to say anything more.

per hansa began to breathe hard and fast; his eyes snapped with excitement, narrowing to little slits. right in the midst of a flock of dancers a big head bobbed up and down, up and down, above all the others, like a buoy on a high sea. . . . then per hansa completely forgot himself.

olk would stretch, neighbour to neighbour, clear out to the rocky mountains! they foresaw the whole process and calculated correctly--but no one in that company believed in the calculation! they heard themselves speak, and listened to one another, but all realized that there was no fire in their words. . . .

"god save them from making mistakes in their figuring!" ran through kjersti's mind, as she listened in awe to per hansa and syvert rolling up the total; but she was careful to throw no cold water on the dream.

. . . on a day like this it was impossible to believe in such fine fancies; they all felt it, deep down in their hearts.

but here came tönseten with a question that made them forget everything else for a while. the conversation had died of its own inertia; no one could find a thought that seemed worth expressing. then tönseten straightened up where he sat on

they were all laughing so hard now that tonseten had to join them in spite of himself. . . . then kjersti and sörine took up the question; the solum boys chimed in and expressed their opinions; while the children were busy discussing it among themselves. but beret sat quietly rocking the baby on her lap, and said nothing.

an earnest liveliness crept into the conversation. opinions flew thick and fast. at last sörine spoke up resolutely, as if she had made up her mind, saying that if she had her choice she would rather be called mrs. vaag, from their place name in norway, than mrs. olsen.

"but, look here, sörrina," objected per hansa, "that wouldn't do for my wife! your notion would make her mrs. skarvholmen3--and that nobody shall call her! i warn you!"

 

3 skarv in this compound means cormorant--a rather nasty-looking sea bird; the word is often used in an adjectival sense about a deadbeat or person of low moral qualities. holmen means the holm. hence skarvholmen--the holm of the cormorant.

 

"no, that certainly wouldn't do for a christian woman!" cried kjersti with a hearty laugh.

"no, i suppose not," admitted sörine, unwilling to give up. "but how about mrs. holm? that seems to me both pretty and practical. . . . i say, beret, shall we all turn baptists for a while?" . . . sörine was laughing in her jolly way, immensely taken up with the idea.

beret sat rocking the child. she had listened absently all the while, humming a quiet melody to herself. when sörine addressed her directly she stopped singing and answered that it made little difference

epped off at a lively pace and gave it what it called for. tönseten was now intent on cutting out the first swathe; it had to be straight, and yet it couldn't leave anything along the edge; he was too much taken up with this momentous task even to see the others. but when he had finished the fourth round of the field he felt that he was master of the situation. stopping the machine, he called in english to henry solum--how was he getting along? could he pound any sense into those idiots? well, kjersti had been a smart binder in her day. why didn't he get her to help him with the instruction? . . . and then, turning majestically in his seat, he addressed per hansa:

"if this wheat doesn't run forty bushels to the acre, i'll eat my own shirt! by god, i will! . . . well, anyway, thirty-five . . ."

"you go on with the cutting, brother!" chuckled per hansa. "here's a whole army waiting for something to do! . . . go on, i say. we'll measure it up later."

time. for the greenhorns the binding proved to be more like work than art; they soon caught on to the trick; there were so many of them at it that the binding this afternoon went like a jolly game. when beret finally put the baby down on the grass and began tying up bundles of wheat kjersti felt that she had to come over and speak to her. there wasn't any need of that, she said; the men could easily handle what had to be done. heavens and earth--five grown men and two boys in a field no bigger than this! beret and sörine had better go home and get a lunch ready, kjersti advised further; the menfolk were never happier than when they had coffee brought to them in the field. she knew them! . . . after a while the two women followed her advice and went home to make their preparations

s face. . . . he must handle these bundles with care--the heavy kernels might shell out. . . . how absurdly light-hearted and gay he felt to-day! . . .

the men continued working until the dew became so heavy on the wheat that the reaping machine refused to go; it was long after sundown before they quit. tönseten felt stiff and tired, but he wasn't announcing the fact from the housetops. in per hansa's hut stood a table heaped with many good things, though the porridge bowls predominated. both kjersti and sörine had been home to do their own chores for the night, and had returned to help beret with the supper.

the men were already seated at the table; but they waited for per hansa, who had his head in the big chest and was hunting for something or other. "hold on a minute, boys, before you say grace," came from the cavernous depths of the chest. "haven't you manners enough to wait for the head of the family?" . . . when he finally emerged and came up to the table, he shook a bottle behind

 in the bottle for one round, and then a little drop to swallow on, before the meal started.

tönseten cleared his throat after the drink; he was anxious to make a little speech:

"what do you plan on doing in the future, per hansa, if you're going to get rich on the very first crop? . . . i never in my life saw such wheat! why, the kernels are like potatoes!"

"how about yourself, then?" inquired per hansa in great good humour. "i like to help worthy people who are in trouble; in case you and kjersti should run short of stockings to keep your money in, you might come to me!"

as the meal went on, the spirits of the men sitting about the table rose higher and higher, and each vied with the other in good cheer.

"rich?" exclaimed tönseten. "we'll all get rich; no doubt about it! . . . it's going to be hardest on sam, poor fellow. he'll have to spend it all in getting married to that fine trönder girl who's waiting for him over east by the sioux river! hard luck, i say!"

"yes, sir!" drawled

 sam, blushing furiously. "but if i were you, kjersti, i wouldn't let syvert go to the wedding--no, i wouldn't at all!"

"why?" laughed kjersti, innocently.

"well, you see, he gets sort of strung-up when he's turned loose among the trönder women--not that i mean anything, you know. . . ."

"sam, you're a fool!" remarked tönseten, angrily, laying down his spoon and leaving the table.

by noon the next day they had finished the wheat field. to-day tönseten was of a different mind--there really was no great hurry; the weather kept cool, and the grain didn't look any riper to-day than yesterday, either at his own place or at

e some help!" cried tönseten through the eerie hail, but the others, standing like statues, heard nothing and paid no heed; the impact of the solid surge had forced them to turn their backs to the wind. tönseten could not hold the horses; they bolted across the field, cutting a wide semi-circle through the oats; not until he had the stern of his craft well into the wind could he stop them long enough to scramble down and unhitch them from the reaper.

at that moment two women came running up--kjersti first, with her skirt thrown over her head, sörine a little way behind, beating the air with frantic motions. the solum boys, too, had now joined the terror-stricken little crowd. down by the creek the grazing cows had hoisted their tails straight in the air and run for the nearest shelter; and no sooner had the horses been turned loose, than they followed suit; man and beast alike were overcome by a nameless fear.

and now from out the sky gushed down with cruel force a living, pulsating stre

their tips, he showed it to his father. the body of the unearthly creature had a dark-brown colour; it was about an inch in length, or perhaps a trifle longer; it was plump around the middle and tapered at both ends; on either side of its head sparkled a tiny black eye that seemed to look out with a supernatural intelligence; underneath it were long, slender legs with rusty bands around them; the wings were transparent and of a pale, light colour.

"for god's sake, child, throw it away!" moaned kjersti.

the boy dropped it in fright. no sooner had he let it go than there sounded a snap, a twinkling flash was seen, and the creature had merged itself with the countless legions of flickering devils which now filled all space. they whizzed by in the air; they literally covered the ground; they lit on the heads of grain, on the stubble, on everything in sight--popping and glittering, millions on millions of them. . . . the people watched it, stricken with fear and awe. here was another one speakin

kjersti was crying bitterly; sörine's kind face was deathly pale as she glanced at the men, trying to bolster up her courage; but the big frame of her husband was bent in fright and dismay. he spoke slowly and solemnly: "this must be one of the plagues mentioned in the bible!"

"yes! and the devil take it!" muttered per hansa, darkly. . . . "but it can't last forever."

to tönseten the words of per hansa, in an hour like this, sounded like the sheerest blasphemy; they would surely call down upon them

 a still darker wrath! he turned to reprove his neighbour: "now the lord is taking back what he has given," he said, impressively. "i might have guessed that i would never be permitted to harvest such wheat. that was asking too much!"

"stop your silly gabble!" snarled per hansa. "do you really suppose he needs to take the bread out of your mouth?"

there was a certain consolation in per hansa's outburst of angry rationalism; kjersti ceased weeping, though it was her own husband that had been put to shame. "i believe per hansa is right," she said, the sobs still choking her. "the lord can't have any use for our wheat. he doesn't need bread, anyway. he certainly wouldn't take it from us in this way!"

but her open unbelief only confirmed her husband in his position; clearing his throat, he began to take kjersti to task: "don't you remember your catechism, and your bible history? isn't it plainly stated that this is one of th

"my, my! how stiff one gets from all this shaking! . . . what's your name, my good man?"

"my name is syvert tönseten. what kind of a fellow may you be?" tönseten came close up and looked inquiringly at the stranger, who had now turned to the woman:

"have you got any food in the house, mother?" and ignoring the man, the traveller took from his cart a large, old, and well-worn satchel, which he deposited on the ground.

"why, yes . . . of course . . . if you will take what we have!" said kjersti, slowly. there she paused; moving behind her husband, she took her hand from under her apron and gave a pull at his jacket; she had now looked the stranger over and didn't feel altogether relieved. . . .

tönseten was too preoccupied with himself to notice her. "i am asking you," he said with pompous dignity, "what kind of a fellow you are and what you are after. are you looking for land?"

the stranger put his hands against his sides, looked straight at them, and said, impressively:

"i am a

minister. as for you, my good man, you ought not to stand there swearing into the face of strangers! . . . now let me ask you again: may i stop here to-night?"

"good heavens!" exclaimed tönseten, letting his breath go as if some one had hit him in the stomach.

"oh, my! oh, my!" wailed kjersti, awe-stricken, yet overwhelmed with joy. "is the man crazy? can he really be a minister? . . . of course he must stop here, if he can only eat the stuff we have!"

"don't worry about that, mother." he turned to her husband. "and now you and i will attend to the horse."

tönseten's knees were weak from penitent zeal; he trembled with eagerness to help; he wanted to talk, but his voice failed and the words would not come. but the horse was wonderfully well cared for; he even went back a second t

to spread another layer of straw for bedding. while they worked the minister had many questions to ask; they took their own time about coming in.

at last tönseten ushered the minister into the hut, placed a chair at the farthest end of the table, and bade him be seated. the table now was laid with a white tablecloth, on which had been placed a superabundance of food for only one person; there were römmekolle and flatbröd, fresh milk and boiled eggs; there were coffee and cakes; but even so, kjersti thought it too little to offer such a distinguished visitor; now she was busy frying a couple of egg pancakes. thank goodness, there was plenty of what she had! she had hurriedly tidied up the room; it looked cozy and comfortable inside the hut, and the minister could not refrain from expressing his admiration.

finally he sat up to the table and began to eat, praising everything that he tasted and helping himself bountifully, like a healthy person whose hunger has been sharpened by a long fast

tönseten remained standing in the middle of the floor, talking with the minister; his manner was humble almost to the point of unction, his voice had taken on a tone of great solemnity. kjersti hung in the background by the stove, where the room lay in shadow, listening closely to the conversation; she was more concerned about what her husband said than to follow the minister's discourse--syvert was so easily excited, poor fellow, and had so little experience in talking to people of quality! she watched the minister as he helped himself liberally to the food, and felt the blessing of it descend upon her. how kind of him to say the nice things he did about the food she had prepared! .

emphatically that that was a subject on which he wasn't very well posted; you couldn't expect a common farmer to know much about such matters. and then he began hurriedly to ask the pastor which way he had come, and whether he had seen many settlers in the parts through which he had travelled. this, in turn, gave him an opportunity to tell how the country looked hereabouts when he had first arrived six years ago; he waxed so eloquent on this point that it seemed difficult for him to stop. . . . kjersti realized that he was now on extremely dangerous ground!--

at last the minister had finished his meal.

"now then, my good man, be silent, and we will thank the lord for this day."

"yes, yes--of course!" . . . tönseten blew his nose vigorously; but not knowing what to do with himself next, he stuck his thumbs inside his trousers-band, and stood where he was in the middle of the floor, utterly unnerved.

kjersti sank down on the wood-box, and wiped her eyes with her apron. . . . she wanted to

ruly, life had not been easy for them! . . . after saying amen, he remained silent for some time, with hands still folded; from the candle on the table a pale glow was thrown over his face, touching the fringe of his beard with pure silver. . . . peace had fallen on the room.

then the minister arose.

"praise be to god, and thanks to you, good people, for this sumptuous feast!"

tönseten again blew his nose violently; then, overcome with confusion, he wheeled about and walked out of the hut.

kjersti sat on the wood-box, weeping with mingled emotions. the minister came over and took her by the hand. "a fine meal you prepared for me, mother, and here are my heartfelt thanks!"

"oh, well--that's nothing!" . . . she shook her head speechlessly, but could not let go his hand.

in a moment tönseten returned. . . . this would never do, he wanted to explain. he wasn't such a bad case as the minister seemed to think. he ought to hear some of the others when they let themselves go! . . . but as soo

ach time filling and lighting it anew. he asked them all about their life, and the struggle they had had since they came to this place. this was rich for tönseten; he never tired of telling. . . . finally the minister knocked out the ashes of his pipe for the last time, got up, and laid it carefully aside.

"well, now the day is done, and a fine, blessed day it has been; the night is approaching, so let us enjoy sweet repose. . . . where do you intend to put me up for the night, mother?"

both kjersti and tönseten felt that they must accompany him to the other hut. there stood the bed, with a small table at its side, covered with a rose-coloured cloth; the room was small and crowded, but seemed cozy and cheerful withal.

"oh, here it will be sweet to stretch one's weary limbs!" exclaimed the minister, joyfully.

"what a wonderful man he is!" thought kjersti. she began to make many excuses because they had nothing better to offer.

with a mixture of jest and earnestness the minister rebuked

her for such talk; soon they were all three laughing together, and it was so pleasant that the hosts could hardly tear themselves away.

tönseten had aged considerably in the last two years; one who had known him before that time would scarcely recognize him now. he had struggled with a bad cough for two consecutive springs; this spring it had been so violent at times that he feared the end had come; but kjersti had finally managed to boil and dose it out of him. it had left its mark, however; he became easily tired now, and needed a lot of sleep in order to keep going.

but to-night he didn't get much sleep; and what little there was brought no rest. serious things to think about had suddenly come forward. . . . oh, my god! . . .

he would have liked to stay with the minister for a private and confidential talk; but he knew that kjersti would never go away and leave them alone. while she was clearing

the table, after they had gone back to their own house, he slipped out and walked over to the other hut; but when he got there he realized that it was too late; he couldn't talk to the minister to-night--it would never do to disturb him now.

at last they went to bed together, tönseten and his wife. kjersti lost consciousness almost at once; but syvert lay awake a long while, pondering over how he might be able to gain the ear of the minister. . . . "to-morrow morning," he thought, "before the minister shows up, i'll take some wash water over to him. i'll sit down in the doorway while he washes, where i can see if anyone is coming; then, maybe, i'll get a chance to talk with him. . . . i'll tell him everything. there's going to be the devil to pay! useless to try any tricks here--i can't get out o

cold sweat was standing on tönseten's for

 didn't seem to have any appetite--he couldn't relish his food. . . . it was astonishing how many things the minister found to ask questions about. . . . throughout the breakfast tönseten sat in the grip of a silent fear, afraid of what might come next; as soon as the meal was safely over, he found a pretext for leaving the room.

a few moments later the minister came out into the yard, with his satchel in his hand, and glanced around at the neighbourhood where he had arrived. in his wake came kjersti, bashfully tripping out of the house; tönseten walked restlessly about the yard, handling one thing after another, but did not approach the minister; then the latter called out to him:

. . . who lived directly west of them?

. . . why, that was hans olsa--that is to say, hans vaag.

. . . and to the north?

. . . that was per holm--or rather per hansa, as he was called.

the minister scrutinized closely that part of the settlement visible from where they stood; then he went on with his inquir

n was now building a grand house of lumber, that would surely be a mansion when it was finished; but it wasn't done yet. . . .

"well, now, let's get to work," said the minister, resolutely. "first of all, my good man, i must get you to help me. will you hurry around to all your neighbours and tell them that to-day, at two o'clock, i shall conduct divine services at the house of this man per holm. everyone must be present--tell them that they have to come! and you, mother"--he turned to address kjersti--"i think it would be a kindness of you if you were to go over and help mrs. holm get the house ready for the service; it need not be anything extraordinary, but the place in which the lord's blessings are dealt out ought at least to be clean and tidy!"

they gazed at the minister in alarm, but for a while said nothing.

"well--poor beret!" sighed kjersti, compassionately.

"beret? . . . so that is her name? what is the matter with the woman? are they so very poor?"

suddenly tönseten forgot h

 has followed him right along. the first year we settled, for instance, the grasshoppers came and made a clean sweep of the rest of us; but per hansa saved his whole crop! the same year he made a big haul with his potatoes . . . why, he must have sold for a thousand that year, and nobody knows how much he has made these years on the fur trade that he's carried on with the indians. . . . he is now settled on three quarters of land!"

"well, well! that's fine! but what ails his wife?"

now it was kjersti's turn; she shook her head sadly as she related all the distressing circumstances. now and then tönseten, fearing that she hadn't made things clear enough, would put in a word. the minister prompted them with questions. after a while he had learned the whole sad story about beret holm. . . . his face clouded as he listened; it was as if the sun had suddenly darkened over a beautiful landscape, until it became drab and desolate to look upon. for a long time he stood there absorbed in thought, t

ractices as some people have here are sacrilegious and must be discontinued . . . you're right in that."

"do you think the lord will ever forgive me?"

"that i truly believe he will! this probably is not the worst sin you have committed!"

tönseten's joy and relief were almost suffocating; he wiped his eyes as he gazed at the minister. . . . what a marvellously sensible man! . . .

"i'll hurry right off and tell them! . . . but, please, i beg of you, don't mention this at home. you see--well, kjersti is not very strong." . . .

and now tönseten was speeding along in great excitement from farm to farm, announcing to all the people that a pastor had come to them at last and that they must gather to hear him, he was such a wonderfully able man. and the farther and faster he went, the easier became the road and the more wonderful did the minister grow in his mind, a fact which he emphasized at every place he came to and enlarged upon whenever he could stop long enough to draw breath. and he fo

that fine little boy awhile," he said to sörine. . . . "of course, i think it would be better if you all came often to see her, but never more than one at a time. and never ask her how she is feeling; just take it for granted that everything is as it should be. to me, things do not look entirely hopeless here; i believe it will all come right in the end. yes, i truly believe it." . . . he took the boy on his knee, and began to play with him.

"god grant that it might happen as he says!" sighed kjersti.

the minister heard her.

"in his name, nothing is impossible! . . . now i should leave at once, if i were you. let the one who is best acquainted here, stay behind."

then the minister took the boy in his arms and went out into the yard; he approached each group standing there, talked to them quietly, and advised them to go home and keep to themselves as much as they could. . . . "for the word of god," he said, "is like seed put into the ground; it must be undisturbed, if it is to germinate a

he largest herd in the settlement, and was doing very well--for those days. . . . and tönseten, after receiving absolution for his great sin, had become all aglow with high ambitions; his prospects were bright of being elected klokker--perhaps deacon, too; life for him was positively glorious, just one grand song. all day his head was full of the idea that he, too, ought to build himself a respectable house. but the plan never seemed to materialize; he still lived in the old sod house. at last kjersti would lose her temper whenever the project was mentioned. the hut was good enough, she said; besides, they had no one to build for! this latter fact, however, she didn't refer to oftener than seemed absolutely necessary; it only made her husband sulky, and then he would call her names, like "whimpering jane" or "weeping willow." . . . he probably wasn't to blame, poor fellow, after all. . . .

in the fall henry solum built an immense barn; he saw that hans olsa had done well by raising cattle,

"beret, my child," she'll say, "you are too foolish--you must guard your speech. one doesn't say everything that comes into one's head, you know!" . . . but then i'll show her how syvert and kjersti, hans olsa and sörine and all the rest, knelt down before the chest and there partook of the glory of the lord. i shall describe it all. . . . she knows hans olsa and sörine--she will believe them. . . . i must show her just where the chest stood. . . . let me see if i can remember the exact words he used:--"the gracious forgiveness of all thy sins." . . . yes, he said all . . . all . . . iam sure of that . . . i remember it distinctly. . . .

man's face brightened as he looked into tönseten's merry eyes; a breath of fresh air flurried from out the red, icicled beard; the whole face bending above him radiated good humour. . . . "i'm glad you came, syvert," said hans olsa in a faint voice.

tönseten now began to feel that the right atmosphere had been established; he hummed a tune, took a chair, and sat down beside the bed. without further prelude, he started to relate what had happened to him that day. . . . yesterday morning, when kjersti had tried to make the fire, the stove wouldn't draw and the room had filled with smoke; not being able to manage the thing, she had come and roused him. he had got up, had dressed, and then tried to open the door, only to find that the whole house was snowed under; from the hillside to the creek stretched one huge, solid drift, and the chimney itself was packed full of snow. . . .

well, he had succeeded after a while in getting a hole through, so that at last they could have their morning coff

ee. it was simply terrible how much snow there was down his way. yesterday he had been busy all day, making steps in the snow down to the house; these had packed fairly well during the day, but to-day they were as solid as ice. . . . and this morning when kjersti had come along carrying a pail of water, she had been so unfortunate as to slip on the top step--"ha-ha!" . . . she had thrown the pail into the air, her feet had shot out from under her, and she hadn't stopped until she'd landed on her backsides in the middle of the floor! . . . "ha-ha-ha!" . . . there she sat. . . . "what in heaven's name are you up to, kjersti?" he had said, when he saw that she hadn't hurt herself very much; and then he naturally had gone off into a fit of laughing. this ha

well, this is what he had done next; he had put on his skis and gone over east in the settlement--had spent the whole afternoon there--just to visit around and see how folks were getting along. at last he had dropped in to see johanne

ad sat there gossiping with them a long while, and had just been telling them what had happened at home that day, when there!--he'd burst out laughing again, and laughed so hard that they all had to join in. and this had thrown johannes into such a good humour that he had hunted up a bottle which he was saving for the coming event, and had given tönseten a drop or two--perhaps it was three--well, it may have been four--if one must be accurate. . . . all this about the stove, and the steps, and kjersti, and about how he had had to take to his heels in order to find peace, he related in epic detail to hans olsa--there seemed to be need of something jolly here! . . . but the number of drinks he really had had, he didn't fully reveal.

there was something so infectious about tönseten's good spirits that they almost coaxed hans olsa into a brighter mood. but then a spell of coughing came on; he choked it back and asked if kjersti hadn't hurt herself pretty badly?

"oh no, boys, never you fear!"

hiccoughed tönseten, wiping his eyes with the backs of his hands. "she's all right, except for a few scratches here and there in the bottom--here and there--but they'll heal up in a little while. . . . everything grows so big and fat around here, you know!" . . . tönseten went off into such another gale of laughter that he almost fell out of his chair.

"well, well!" . . . he said as soon as he could control himself, getting up to leave. "to-morrow i shall bring kjersti over here with me. you just wait--we'll get the cough boiled out of that chest of yours! kjersti knows how to treat a cough, i can tell you!" . . .

beret had stopped her singing abruptly when tönseten came in. as he rambled on she sat and watched his face--something made her look at him in spite of herself. she listened to his half-maudlin laughter--and it seemed to her she never had realized before how disgusting his laugh was. his breath smelled of whisky. at first she felt furious

lly in bed, gasping for breath. the bedclothes fell off him, the poultices slipped down, and beret had to leave her praying to attend to him. and when he was quiet again he asked to have his milk warmed; then he had to get up; from that he got an attack of chills, and beret had to call sörine to help her warm the clothes once more and tuck him in.

with the first grey light of dawn johannes mörstad arrived, begging and begging that beret go with him--josie was coming down; he had tried to get kjersti, but she had lamed herself so badly the other day, that it was impossible for her to walk that far. . . . "this is certainly the work of the devil!" thought beret. "just now . . . !" but she went out of the house full of the same great exaltation, like one whose sins had been laid bare before the whole congregation. . . .

a little while later per hansa dropped in to see how they were getting along. he said that he would arrange with the solum boys to help him carry hay and water to t

rom anybody who had one; and if they had no coffee mill in the house, they would use a mortar, or improvise one from a kettle. folks were cheerful about helping one another in those days. what one didn't have, he borrowed; if one got a new idea, he passed it on to his neighbours. the scarcity of fuel caused the most suffering, for hay burned like hay, even if twisted.

tönseten was sitting in the bedroom at hans olsa's when per hansa came back after supper. he was downhearted and quiet to-day. kjersti had been in bed most of the time because of the stiffness and soreness from her fall; and she was so cross, he explained, that if a fellow as much as looked at her she would bite his head off. he had had the devil to pay, with taking care of both her and himself and doing the chores besides. . . . as he noticed how flushed hans olsa's face was and heard how he struggled for breath, he wondered if his own cough had ever been as bad as this. if this was worse than he had had it three years ago, t
