[CHARACTER] - 
      
        the only daughter of titus andronicus, she spurns saturninus's offer to make her his empress because she is in love with bassianus. she is brutally raped and disfigured by chiron and demetrius in the forest during the hunt. thereafter, she is a mute and horrifying presence constantly on stage, complement to her father's loquacious sufferings, and accomplice to his bloody vengeance. deprived of every means of communication, and robbed of her most precious chastity, she comes across as one of shakespeare's most incapacitated heroines. yet, as she is physically pared down, her narrative and thematic importance escalates, drawing our attention to the importance of pantomime on the stage. the rape of [CHARACTER] is undoubtedly the central and most horrific crime of the play, which is why edward ravenscroft's adaptation of the play has the alternate name of "the rape of [CHARACTER]." for this reason, her character invites especially careful scrutiny.
