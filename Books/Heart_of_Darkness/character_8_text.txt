 of light planks served for a pilot-house. it contained a couch,
two camp-stools, a loaded martini-henry leaning in one corner, a tiny
table, and the steering-wheel. it had a wide door in front and a broad
shutter at each side. all these were always thrown open, of course. i
spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof,
before the door. at night i slept, or tried to, on the couch. an
athletic black belonging to some coast tribe and educated by my poor
predecessor, was the helmsman. he sported a pair of brass earrings, wore
a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the
world of himself. he was the most unstable kind of fool i had ever seen.
he steered with no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost
sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and would
let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute.

cause there was a snag in the fairway. sticks,
little sticks, were flying about--thick: they were whizzing before my
nose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my pilot-house. all
this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet--perfectly
quiet. i could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern-wheel
and the patter of these things. we cleared the snag clumsily. arrows, by
jove! we were being shot at! i stepped in quickly to close the shutter
on the landside. that fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was
lifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a
reined-in horse. confound him! and we were staggering within ten feet of
the bank. i had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter, and i saw
a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own, looking at me very
fierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed
from my eyes, i made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked breasts,
arms, legs, glaring eyes--the bush was swar

ming with human limbs in
movement, glistening of bronze colour. the twigs shook, swayed, and
rustled, the arrows flew out of them, and then the shutter came to.
‘steer her straight,’ i said to the helmsman. he held his head rigid,
face forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting and setting down
his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little. ‘keep quiet!’ i said in a
fury. i might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind.
i darted out. below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron
deck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, ‘can you turn back?’
i caught sight of a v-shaped ripple on the water ahead. what? another
snag! a fusillade burst out under my feet. the

g was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded
smoke, there was no time to lose, so i just crowded her into the
bank--right into the bank, where i knew the water was deep.

“we tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs
and flying leaves. the fusillade below stopped short, as i had foreseen
it would when the squirts got empty. i threw my head back to a glinting
whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out
at the other. looking past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty
rifle and yelling at the shore, i saw vague forms of men running bent
double, leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent. something
big appeared in the air before the shutter, the rifle went overboard,
and the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over his shoulder in an
extraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet. the
side of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared
a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little c

ten.
whatever he was, he was not common. he had the power to charm or
frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his
honour; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter
misgivings: he had one devoted friend at least, and he had conquered
one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with
self-seeking. no; i can’t forget him, though i am not prepared to affirm
the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. i
missed my late helmsman awfully--i missed him even while his body
was still lying in the pilot-house. perhaps you will think it passing
strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of
sand in a black sahara. well, don’t you see, he had done something, he
had steered; for months i had him at my back--a help--an instrument. it
was a kind of partnership. he steered for me--i had to look after him, i
worried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created,
of which i only became

magpies, and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude.
what they wanted to keep that body hanging about for i can’t guess.
embalm it, maybe. but i had also heard another, and a very ominous,
murmur on the deck below. my friends the wood-cutters were likewise
scandalized, and with a better show of reason--though i admit that the
reason itself was quite inadmissible. oh, quite! i had made up my mind
that if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes alone should have
him. he had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was
dead he might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause
some startling trouble. besides, i was anxious to take the wheel, the
man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.

“this i did directly the simple funeral was over. we were going
half-speed, keeping right in the middle of the stream, and i listened
to the talk about me. they had
