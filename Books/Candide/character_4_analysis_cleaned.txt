[CHARACTER] 
[CHARACTER] sheds a subtle and interesting light on the philosophical themes
of the novel. unlike any other character in the novel, he inspires
perfect confidence, both in his intelligence and his moral uprightness.
he knows both native american and european languages, and deals
capably with both the jesuits and the biglugs. he suffers fewer
gross misfortunes than any other character, less out of luck than
because of his sharp wits, and he lives up to candide's trust when
candide sends him to fetch cunegonde. any reader tempted to conclude
that voltaire has no faith in human nature must reconsider when
faced with the example of [CHARACTER]. despite the optimism [CHARACTER]
inspires, however, he is no optimist himself. his wide experience
of the world has led [CHARACTER] to conclude that "the law of nature
teaches us to kill our neighbor."
