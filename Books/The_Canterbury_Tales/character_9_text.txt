; that spoken by
the learned and the noble, based on the french  yet each branch
had begun to borrow of the other -- just as nobles and people
had been taught to recognise that each needed the other in the
wars and the social tasks of the time; and chaucer, a scholar, a
courtier, a man conversant with all orders of society, but
accustomed to speak, think, and write in the words of the
highest, by his comprehensive genius cast into the simmering
mould a magical amalgamant which made the two half-hostile
elements unite and interpenetrate each other. before chaucer
wrote, there were two tongues in england, keeping alive the
feuds and resentments of cruel centuries; when he laid down his
pen, there was practically but one speech -- there was, and ever
since has been, but one people.

geoffrey chaucer, according to the most trustworthy traditions-
for authentic testimonies on the subject are wanting -- was born
in 1328; and london is generally believed to have been his
birth-place. it is true t

 with regard to a contest on a point of heraldry between
lord scrope and sir robert grosvenor, chaucer deposed that
he entered on his military career in 1359. in that year edward
iii invaded france, for the third time, in pursuit of his claim to
the french crown; and we may fancy that, in describing the
embarkation of the knights in "chaucer's dream", the poet
gained some of the vividness and stir of his picture from his
recollections of the embarkation of the splendid and well-
appointed royal host at sandwich, on board the eleven hundred
transports provided for the enterprise. in this expedition the
laurels of poitiers were flung on the ground; after vainly
attempting rheims and paris, edward was constrained, by cruel
weather and lack of provisions, to retreat toward his ships; the
fury of the elements made the retreat more disastrous than an
overthrow in pitched battle; horses and men perished by
thousands, or fell into the hands of the pursuing french.

concerning his personal appearance and habits, chaucer has not
been reticent in his poetry. urry sums up the traits of his aspect
and character fairly thus: "he was of a middle stature, the latter
part of his life inclinable to be fat and corpulent, as appears by
the host's bantering him in the journey to canterbury, and
comparing shapes with him.<16>  his face was fleshy, his
features just and regular, his complexion fair, and somewhat
pale, his hair of a dusky yellow, short and thin; the hair of his
beard in two forked tufts, of a wheat colour; his forehead broad
and smooth; his eyes inclining usually to the ground, which is
intimated by the host's words; his whole face full of liveliness, a
calm, easy sweetness, and a studious venerable aspect. . . . as

joyousness.

the poet, the evening before he starts on a pilgrimage to the
shrine of st thomas at canterbury, lies at the tabard inn, in
southwark, curious to know in what companionship he is
destined to fare forward on the morrow. chance sends him
"nine and twenty in a company," representing all orders of
english society, lay and clerical, from the knight and the abbot
down to the ploughman and the sompnour. the jolly host of
the tabard, after supper, when tongues are loosened and hearts
are opened, declares that "not this year" has he seen such a
company at once under his roof-tree, and proposes that, when
they set out next morning, he should ride with them and make
them sport. all agree, and harry bailly unfolds his scheme: each
pilgrim, including the poet, shall tell two tales on the road to
canterbury, and two on the way back to london; and he whom
the general voice pronounces to have told the best tale, shal

treated to a supper at the common cost -- and, of course, to
mine host's profit -- when the cavalcade returns from the saint's
shrine to the southwark hostelry. all joyously assent; and early
on the morrow, in the gay spring sunshine, they ride forth,
listening to the heroic tale of the brave and gentle knight, who
has been gracefully chosen by the host to lead the spirited
competition of story-telling.

to describe thus the nature of the plan, and to say that when
chaucer conceived, or at least began to execute it, he was
between sixty and seventy years of age, is to proclaim that the
canterbury tales could never be more than a fragment. thirty
pilgrims, each telling two tales on the way out, and two more
on the way back -- that makes 120 tales; to say nothing of the
prologue, the description of the journey, the occurrences at

l the manuscripts; but in
some, of minor authority, the cook is made to break off his
tale, because "it is so foul," and to tell the story of gamelyn, on
which shakespeare's "as you like it" is founded. the story is
not chaucer's, and is different in metre, and inferior in
composition to the tales. it is supposed that chaucer expunged
the cook's tale for the same reason that made him on his death-
bed lament that he had written so much "ribaldry."



the man of law's tale.


the prologue.


our hoste saw well that the brighte sun
th' arc of his artificial day had run
the fourthe part, and half an houre more;
and, though he were not deep expert in lore,
he wist it was the eight-and-twenty day
of april, that is messenger to may;
and saw well that the shadow of every tree
was in its length of the same quantity
that was the body erect that caused it;
and therefore by the shadow he took his wit*,                 *knowledge

let us not moulde thus in idleness.
"sir man of law," quoth he, "so have ye bliss,
tell us a tale anon, as forword* is.                        *the bargain

to stand in this case at my judgement.

then have ye done your devoir* at the least."                      *duty
"hoste," quoth he, "de par dieux jeo asente; <3>

for such law as a man gives another wight,

and with that word, he with a sober cheer
began his tale, and said as ye shall hear.


notes to the prologue to the man of law's tale


1. plight: pulled; the word is an obsolete past tense from
"pluck."

2. no more than will malkin's maidenhead: a proverbial saying;
which, however, had obtained fresh point from the reeve's
tale, to which the host doubtless refers.

3. de par dieux jeo asente: "by god, i agree".  it is
characteristic that the somewhat pompous sergeant of law
should couch his assent in the semi-barbarous french, then
familiar in law procedure.

4. ceyx and alcyon: chaucer treats of these in the introduction
to the poem called "the book of the duchess."  it relates to the
death of blanche, wife of john of gaunt, duke of lancaster, the
poet's patron, and afterwards his connexion by marriage.

5. the saintes legend of cupid:

"sir clerk of oxenford," our hoste said,
"ye ride as still and coy, as doth a maid
that were new spoused, sitting at the board:
this day i heard not of your tongue a word.

keep them in store, till so be ye indite
high style, as when that men to kinges write.
speake so plain at this time, i you pray,
that we may understande what ye say."

this worthy clerk benignely answer'd;
"hoste," quoth he, "i am under your yerd,*                      *rod <1>
ye have of us as now the governance,
and therefore would i do you obeisance,

dwelled this flow'r of wifely patience,

notes to the prologue to the merchant's tale


1.  though the manner in which the merchant takes up the
closing words of the envoy to the clerk's tale, and refers to
the patience of griselda, seems to prove beyond doubt that
the order of the tales in the text is the right one, yet in
some manuscripts of good authority the franklin's tale
follows the clerk's, and the envoy is concluded by this
stanza: --
"this worthy clerk when ended was his tale,
our hoste said, and swore by cocke's bones
'me lever were than a barrel of ale

in other manuscripts of less authority the host proceeds, in
two similar stanzas, to impose a tale on the franklin; but
tyrwhitt is probably right in setting them aside as spurious,
and in admitting the genuineness of the first only, if it be
supposed that chauce

32. "store" is the general reading here, but its meaning is not
obvious.  "stowre" is found in several manuscripts; it signifies
"struggle" or "resist;" and both for its own appropriateness, and
for the force which it gives the word "stronge," the reading in
the text seems the better.

my will is good; and lo, my tale is this."


notes to the prologue to the squire's tale


1. women connen utter such chaffare: women are adepts at
giving circulation to such wares.  the host evidently means that
his wife would be sure to hear of his confessions from some
female member of the company.

notes to the squire's tale


1. the squire's tale has not been found under any other form
among the literary remains of the middle ages; and it is
unknown from what original it was derived, if from any. the
tale is unfinished, not because the conclusion has been lost, but
because the author left it so.

2. the russians and tartars waged constant hostilities between
the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries.

3. in the best manuscripts the name is "cambynskan," and thus,
no doubt, it should strictly be read. but it is a most pardonable
offence against literal accuracy to use the word which milton
has made classical, in "il penseroso," speaking of

           "him that left half-told
the story of cambuscan bold,
of camball, and of algarsife,
and who had canace to wife,

1. chaucer crowns the satire on the romanticists by making the
very landlord of the tabard cry out in indignant disgust against
the stuff which he had heard recited -- the good host ascribing
to sheer ignorance the string of pompous platitudes and prosaic
details which chaucer had uttered.

2. drafty:  worthless, vile; no better than draff or dregs; from
the anglo-saxon, "drifan" to drive away, expel.

and with this speech the cook waxed all wraw,*                 *wrathful

and ere that he again were in the saddle
there was great shoving bothe to and fro
to lift him up, and muche care and woe,
so unwieldy was this silly paled ghost.

and certainly, to tellen as it was,
of this vessel the cook drank fast (alas!
what needed it? he drank enough beforn),
and when he hadde *pouped in his horn,*                        *belched*
to the manciple he took the gourd again.
and of that drink the cook was wondrous fain,
and thanked him in such wise as he could.

then gan our host to laughe wondrous loud,
and said, "i see well it is necessary
where that we go good drink with us to carry;
for that will turne rancour and disease*             *trouble, annoyance

that men do while they be in good life be all amortised [killed,

that men do while they be in deadly sin be utterly dead, as for to
have the life perdurable [everlasting], well may that man that no
good works doth, sing that new french song, j'ai tout perdu --

both the goodness of nature, and eke the goodness of grace.
for soothly the grace of the holy ghost fareth like fire, that
may not be idle; for fire faileth anon as it forleteth [leaveth] its
working, and right so grace faileth anon as it forleteth its
working. then loseth the sinful man the goodness of glory, that
only is to good men that labour and work. well may he be sorry
then, that oweth all his life to god, as long as he hath lived, and
also as long as he shall live, that no goodness hath to pay with
his debt to god, to whom he oweth all his life: for trust well he

therefore either he forgiveth all, or else right naught." further,
contrition should be "wonder sorrowful and anguishous," and
also continual, with steadfast purpose of confession and
amendment. lastly, of what contrition availeth, the parson says,
that sometimes it delivereth man from sin; that without it neither
confession nor satisfaction is of any worth; that it "destroyeth
the prison of hell, and maketh weak and feeble all the strengths
of the devils, and restoreth the gifts of the holy ghost and of all
good virtues, and cleanseth the soul of sin, and delivereth it
from the pain of hell, and from the company of the devil, and
from the servage [slavery] of sin, and restoreth it to all goods
spiritual, and to the company and communion of holy church."
he who should set his intent to these things, would no longer be
inclined to sin, but would give his heart and body to the service
of jesus christ, and thereof do him homage. "for, certes, our
lord jesus christ hath spared us so benignly

, and sloth maketh him heavy,
thoughtful, and peevish. it is opposed to every estate of man --
as unfallen, and held to work in praising and adoring god; as
sinful, and held to labour in praying for deliverance from sin;
and as in the state of grace, and held to works of penitence. it
resembles the heavy and sluggish condition of those in hell; it
will suffer no hardness and no penance; it prevents any
beginning of good works; it causes despair of god's mercy,
which is the sin against the holy ghost; it induces somnolency
and neglect of communion in prayer with god; and it breeds
negligence or recklessness, that cares for nothing, and is the
nurse of all mischiefs, if ignorance is their mother. against
sloth, and these and other branches and fruits of it, the remedy
lies in the virtue of fortitude or strength, in its various species of
magnanimity or great courage; faith and hope in god and his
saints; surety or sickerness, when a man fears nothing that can

second part of penitence: the third part of penitence is
satisfaction, and that standeth generally in almsdeed and bodily
pain. now be there three manner of almsdeed: contrition of
heart, where a man offereth himself to god; the second is, to
have pity of the default of his neighbour; the third is, in giving

have need, and namely [specially] sustenance of man's food.
and take keep [heed] that a man hath need of these things
generally; he hath need of food, of clothing, and of herberow

12. this reference, approximately fixing the date at which the
poem was composed, points clearly to chaucer's daily work as
comptroller of the customs -- a post which he held from 1374
to 1386.

13. this is a frank enough admission that the poet was fond of
good cheer; and the effect of his "little abstinence" on his
corporeal appearance is humorously described in the prologue
to the tale of sir thopas, where the host compliments chaucer
on being as well shapen in the waist as himself.

14. "to make the beard" means to befool or deceive. see note
15 to the reeve's tale. precisely the same idea is conveyed in
the modern slang word "shave" -- meaning a trick or fraud.

tales.

the prologue to the canterbury tales is said to be "saint julian
in his country," for his open house and liberal cheer. the eagle,
at sight of the house of fame, cries out "bon hostel!" -- "a fair
lodging, a glorious house, by st julian!"

notes to troilus and cressida


1. the double sorrow: first his suffering before his love was
successful; and then his grief after his lady had been separated
from him, and had proved unfaithful.

2. tisiphone: one of the eumenides, or furies, who avenged on
men in the next world the crimes committed on earth. chaucer
makes this grim invocation most fitly, since the trojans were
under the curse of the eumenides, for their part in the offence
of paris in carrying off helen, the wife of his host menelaus,
and thus impiously sinning against the laws of hospitality.

3. see chaucer's description of himself in "the house of
fame," and note 11 to that poem.

4. the palladium, or image of pallas (daughter of triton and
foster-sister of athena), was said to have fallen from heaven at
troy, where ilus was just beginning to found the city; and ilus
erected a sanctuary, in which it was preserved with great
honour and care, since on its safety was supposed to depend the
safety of the city. in la

awakes, finding his cheeks and body all wet with tears; and,
removing into another chamber, to rest more in peace, he falls
asleep anew, and continues the dream. again he is within the
island, where the knight and all the ladies are assembled on a
green, and it is resolved by the assembly, not only that the
knight shall be their king, but that every lady there shall be
wedded also. it is determined that the knight shall depart that
very day, and return, within ten days, with such a host of
benedicts, that none in the isle need lack husbands. the knight

to keep the day it might not be'n,

wherefore the prince slept neither day nor night, till he and his
people landed on the glass-walled isle, "weening to be in heav'n
that night." but ere they had gone a little way, they met a lady
all in black, with piteous countenance, who reproached the
prince for his untruth, and informed him that, unable to bear the
reproach to their name, cau

e shall see the piteous sight
that ever yet was shown to knight;
for ye shall see ladies stand,
each with a greate rod in hand,
clad in black, with visage white,
ready each other for to smite,
if any be that will not weep;
or who makes countenance to sleep.
they be so beat, that all so blue
they be as cloth that dy'd is new."

scarcely has the lady ceased to speak, when the prince plucks
forth a dagger, plunges it into his heart, and, drawing but one
breath, expires.

for whiche cause the lusty host,
which [stood] in battle on the coast,
at once for sorrow such a cry
gan rear, thorough* the company,                             *throughout

the lords of the laggard host ask the woebegone lady what
should be done; she answers that nothing can now avail, but
that for remembrance they should build in their land, open to
public view, "in some notable old city," a chapel engraved with
some memorial of the queen. and straightway, with a sigh, she
also "pass'd her breath."

then said the lordes of the host,
and so concluded least and most,
that they would ay in houses of thack*                           *thatch
their lives lead, <10> and wear but black,
and forsake all their pleasances,
and turn all joy to penances;
and bare the dead prince to the barge,

                    a ballad of gentleness.


the firste stock-father of gentleness, <1>
what man desireth gentle for to be,
must follow his trace, and all his wittes dress,*                 *apply
virtue to love, and vices for to flee;
for unto virtue longeth dignity,
and not the reverse, safely dare i deem,
*all wear he* mitre, crown, or diademe.                *whether he wear*

this firste stock was full of righteousness,
true of his word, sober, pious, and free,
*clean of his ghost,* and loved business,               *pure of spirit*
against the vice of sloth, in honesty;
and, but his heir love virtue as did he,
he is not gentle, though he riche seem,
all wear he mitre, crown, or diademe.

vice may well be heir to old richess,
but there may no man, as men may well see,
bequeath his heir his virtuous nobless;
that is appropried* to no degree,                    *specially reserved
but to the first father in majesty,
which makes his heire him that doth him queme,*

and truth thee shall deliver, it is no dread.

what thee is sent, receive in buxomness;*                    *submission
the wrestling of this world asketh a fall;
here is no home, here is but wilderness.

look up on high, and thank thy god of all!
