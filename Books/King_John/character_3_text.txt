  king john. now, say, chatillon, what would france with us?
  chatillon. thus, after greeting, speaks the king of france
    in my behaviour to the majesty,
    the borrowed majesty, of england here.
  elinor. a strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
  king john. silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
  chatillon. philip of france, in right and true behalf
    of thy deceased brother geffrey's son,
    arthur plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
    to this fair island and the territories,
    to ireland, poictiers, anjou, touraine, maine,
    desiring thee to lay aside the sword
    which sways usurpingly these several titles,
    and put the same into young arthur's hand,
    thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
  king john. what follows if we disallow of this?
  chatillon. the proud control of fierce and bloody war,
    to enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.

enter, on one side, austria and forces; on the other, king philip
of france,
lewis the dauphin, constance, arthur, and forces

  king philip. before angiers well met, brave austria.
    arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
    richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
    and fought the holy wars in palestine,
    by this brave duke came early to his grave;
    and for amends to his posterity,
    at our importance hither is he come
    to spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf;
    and to rebuke the usurpation
    of thy unnatural uncle, english john.

  arthur. god shall forgive you coeur-de-lion's death
    the rather that you give his offspring life,
    shadowing their right under your wings of war.
    i give you welcome with a powerless hand,
    but with a heart full of unstained love;
    welcome before the gates of angiers, duke.
  king philip. a noble boy! who would not do thee right?
  austria. upon thy cheek lay i this zealous kiss
    as seal to this indenture of my love:
    that to my home i will no more return

    but, ass, i'll take that burden from your back,
    or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
  austria. what cracker is this same that deafs our ears
    with this abundance of superfluous breath?
    king philip, determine what we shall do straight.
  king philip. women and fools, break off your conference.
    king john, this is the very sum of all:
    england and ireland, anjou, touraine, maine,
    in right of arthur, do i claim of thee;
    wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?
  king john. my life as soon. i do defy thee, france.
    arthur of britaine, yield thee to my hand,
    and out of my dear love i'll give thee more
    than e'er the coward hand of france can win.
    submit thee, boy.
  elinor. come to thy grandam, child.
  constance. do, child, go to it grandam, child;
    give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
    give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig.

  constance. now shame upon you, whe'er she does or no!
    his grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
    draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,
    which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;

    to do him justice and revenge on you.

  elinor. thou unadvised scold, i can produce
    a will that bars the title of thy son.
  constance. ay, who doubts that? a will, a wicked will;
    a woman's will; a cank'red grandam's will!
  king philip. peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate.
    it ill beseems this presence to cry aim
    to these ill-tuned repetitions.
    some trumpet summon hither to the walls
    these men of angiers; let us hear them speak
    whose title they admit, arthur's or john's.

  citizen. who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
  king philip. 'tis france, for england.
  king john. england for itself.

    and let young arthur, duke of britaine, in,
    who by the hand of france this day hath made
    much work for tears in many an english mother,
    whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;
    many a widow's husband grovelling lies,
    coldly embracing the discoloured earth;
    and victory with little loss doth play
    upon the dancing banners of the french,
    who are at hand, triumphantly displayed,
    to enter conquerors, and to proclaim
    arthur of britaine england's king and yours.

    her presence would have interrupted much.
    where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.
  lewis. she is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.
  king philip. and, by my faith, this league that we have made
    will give her sadness very little cure.
    brother of england, how may we content
    this widow lady? in her right we came;
    which we, god knows, have turn'd another way,
    to our own vantage.
  king john. we will heal up all,
    for we'll create young arthur duke of britaine,
    and earl of richmond; and this rich fair town
    we make him lord of. call the lady constance;
    some speedy messenger bid her repair
    to our solemnity. i trust we shall,
    if not fill up the measure of her will,
    yet in some measure satisfy her so
    that we shall stop her exclamation.
    go we as well as haste will suffer us
    to this unlook'd-for, unprepared pomp.

  king john. five moons!
  hubert. old men and beldams in the streets
    do prophesy upon it dangerously;
    young arthur's death is common in their mouths;
    and when they talk of him, they shake their heads,
    and whisper one another in the ear;
    and he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
    whilst he that hears makes fearful action
    with wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.

    why urgest thou so oft young arthur's death?
    thy hand hath murd'red him. i had a mighty cause
    to wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
  hubert. no had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?
  king john. it is the curse of kings to be attended
    by slaves that take their humours for a warrant
    to break within the bloody house of life,
    and on the winking of authority
