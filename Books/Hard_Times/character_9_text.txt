but his due was acceptable.

he had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town, which
was neither town nor country, and yet was either spoiled, when his ears
were invaded by the sound of music.  the clashing and banging band
attached to the horse-riding establishment, which had there set up its
rest in a wooden pavilion, was in full bray.  a flag, floating from the
summit of the temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was â€˜slearyâ€™s
horse-ridingâ€™ which claimed their suffrages.  sleary himself, a stout
modern statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesiastical niche
of early gothic architecture, took the money.  miss josephine sleary, as
some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then
inaugurating the entertainments with her graceful equestrian tyrolean
flower-act.  among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders
which must be seen to be believed, signor jupe was that afternoon to
â€˜elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his hi

outside the door, and there stood stroking his face,
and softly whistling.  while thus engaged, he overheard such phrases in
mr. bounderbyâ€™s voice as â€˜no.  _i_ say no.  i advise you not.  i say by
no means.â€™  while, from mr. gradgrind, he heard in his much lower tone
the words, â€˜but even as an example to louisa, of what this pursuit which
has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in.  think
of it, bounderby, in that point of view.â€™

meanwhile, the various members of slearyâ€™s company gradually gathered
together from the upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from
standing about, talking in low voices to one another and to mr. childers,
gradually insinuated themselves and him into the room.  there were two or
three handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands,
and their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children,
who did the fairy business when required.  the father of one of the
families was in the habit of balanci

all orderly in their domestic
arrangements, and the combined literature of the whole company would have
produced but a poor letter on any subject.  yet there was a remarkable
gentleness and childishness about these people, a special inaptitude for
any kind of sharp practice, and an untiring readiness to help and pity
one another, deserving often of as much respect, and always of as much
generous construction, as the every-day virtues of any class of people in
the world.

last of all appeared mr. sleary: a stout man as already mentioned, with
one fixed eye, and one loose eye, a voice (if it can be called so) like
the efforts of a broken old pair of bellows, a flabby surface, and a
muddled head which was never sober and never drunk.

â€˜thquire!â€™ said mr. sleary, who was troubled with asthma, and whose
breath came far too thick and heavy for the letter s, â€˜your thervant!

here his daughter josephineâ€”a pretty fair-haired girl of eighteen, who
had been tied on a horse at two years old, and had made a will at twelve,
which she always carried about with her, expressive of her dying desire
to be drawn to the grave by the two piebald poniesâ€”cried, â€˜father

had run out of it.  and when she saw them all assembled, and saw their
looks, and saw no father there, she broke into a most deplorable cry, and
took refuge on the bosom of the most accomplished tight-rope lady
(herself in the family-way), who knelt down on the floor to nurse her,
and to weep over her.

â€˜ith an internal thame, upon my thoul it ith,â€™ said sleary.

â€˜o my dear father, my good kind father, where are you gone?  you are gone
to try to do me some good, i know!  you are gone away for my sake, i am
sure!  and how miserable and helpless you will be without me, poor, poor
father, until you come back!â€™  it was so pathetic to hear her saying many
things of this kind, with her face turned upward, and her arms stretched
out as if she were trying to stop his departing shadow and embrace it,
that no one spoke a word until mr. bounderby (growing im

you live.â€™

they cared so little for plain fact, these people, and were in that
advanced state of degeneracy on the subject, that instead of being
impressed by the speakerâ€™s strong common sense, they took it in
extraordinary dudgeon.  the men muttered â€˜shame!â€™ and the women â€˜brute!â€™
and sleary, in some haste, communicated the following hint, apart to mr.
bounderby.

â€˜i tell you what, thquire.  to thpeak plain to you, my opinion ith that
you had better cut it thort, and drop it.  theyâ€™re a very good naturâ€™d

mr. bounderby being restrained by this mild suggestion, mr. gradgrind

â€˜thath agreed, thquire.  thick to that!â€™  from sleary.

â€˜well then.  i, who came here to inform the father of the poor girl,

â€˜when father comes back,â€™ cried the girl, bursting into tears again after
a minuteâ€™s silence, â€˜how will he ever find me if i go away!â€™

â€˜you may be quite at ease,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, calmly; he worked out the
whole matter like a sum: â€˜you may be quite at ease, jupe, on that score.
in such a case, your father, i apprehend, must find out mr.â€”â€™

â€˜thleary.  thath my name, thquire.  not athamed of it.  known all over

should have no power of keeping you against his wish, and he would have
no difficulty, at any time, in finding mr. thomas gradgrind of coketown.

â€˜well known,â€™ assented mr. sleary, rolling his loose eye.  â€˜youâ€™re one of
the thort, thquire, that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the

there was another silence; and then she exclaimed, sobbing with her hands

the women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes togetherâ€”it was
soon done, for they were not manyâ€”and to pack them in a basket which had
often travelled with them.  sissy sat all the time upon the ground, still
sobbing, and covering her eyes.  mr. gradgrind and his friend bounderby
stood near the door, ready to take her away.  mr. sleary stood in the
middle of the room, with the male members of the company about him,
exactly as he would have stood in the centre of the ring during his
daughter josephineâ€™s performance.  he wanted nothing but his whip.

the basket packed in silence, they brought her bonnet to her, and
smoothed her disordered hair, and put it on.  then they pressed about
her, and bent over her in very natural attitudes, kissing and embracing
her: and brought the children to take leave of her; and were a

â€˜now, jupe,â€™ said mr. gradgrind.  â€˜if you are quite determined, come!â€™

but she had to take her farewell of the male part of the company yet, and
every one of them had to unfold his arms (for they all assumed the
professional attitude when they found themselves near sleary), and give
her a parting kissâ€”master kidderminster excepted, in whose young nature
there was an original flavour of the misanthrope, who was also known to
have harboured matrimonial views, and who moodily withdrew.  mr. sleary
was reserved until the last.  opening his arms wide he took her by both
her hands, and would have sprung her up and down, after the riding-master
manner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from a rapid
act; but there was no rebound in sissy, and she only

must have come upon him, poor, poor father! of going away to try
something for my sake; for when i came back, he was gone.â€™

â€˜i say!  look sharp for old bounderby, loo!â€™ tom remonstrated.

â€˜thereâ€™s no more to tell, miss louisa.  i keep the nine oils ready for
him, and i know he will come back.  every letter that i see in mr.
gradgrindâ€™s hand takes my breath away and blinds my eyes, for i think it
comes from father, or from mr. sleary about father.  mr. sleary promised
to write as soon as ever father should be heard of, and i trust to him to
keep his word.â€™

â€˜do look sharp for old bounderby, loo!â€™ said tom, with an impatient
whistle.  â€˜heâ€™ll be off if you donâ€™t look sharp!â€™

presence of his family, and said in a faltering way, â€˜i beg your pardon,
sir, for being troublesomeâ€”butâ€”have you had any letter yet about me?â€™

more then, and said, â€œwhere can i go?  i have very little money, and i

people.â€™

ere was a greater danger every moment of his
being suspected now, and nobody could be sure at heart but that mr.
bounderby himself, in a bullying vein of public zeal, might play a roman
partâ€”it was consented that sissy and louisa should repair to the place in
question, by a circuitous course, alone; and that the unhappy father,
setting forth in an opposite direction, should get round to the same
bourne by another and wider route.  it was further agreed that he should
not present himself to mr. sleary, lest his intentions should be
mistrusted, or the intelligence of his arrival should cause his son to
take flight anew; but, that the communication should be left to sissy and
louisa to open; and that they should inform the cause of so much misery
and disgrace, of his fatherâ€™s being at hand and of the purpose for which
they had come.  when these arrangements had been well considered and were
fully understood by all three, it was time to begin to carry them into
execution.  early in the aftern

circumstances), it was noon before they began to find the bills of
slearyâ€™s horse-riding on barns and walls, and one oâ€™clock when they
stopped in the market-place.

a grand morning performance by the riders, commencing at that very hour,
was in course of announcement by the bellman as they set their feet upon
the stones of the street.  sissy recommended that, to avoid making
inquiries and attracting attention in the town, they should present
themselves to pay at the door.  if mr. sleary were taking the money, he
would be sure to know her, and would proceed with discretion.  if he were
not, he would be sure to see them inside; and, knowing what he had done
with the fugitive, would proceed with discretion still.

therefore, they repaired, with fluttering hearts, to the well-remembered
booth.  the flag with the inscription slearyâ€™s horse-riding was there;
and the gothic niche was there; but mr. sleary was not there.  master
kidderminster, grown too maturely turfy to be received

extreme sharpness of his look out
for base coin, mr. kidderminster, as at present situated, never saw
anything but money; so sissy passed him unrecognised, and they went in.

the emperor of japan, on a steady old white horse stencilled with black
spots, was twirling five wash-hand basins at once, as it is the favourite
recreation of that monarch to do.  sissy, though well acquainted with his
royal line, had no personal knowledge of the present emperor, and his
reign was peaceful.  miss josephine sleary, in her celebrated graceful
equestrian tyrolean flower act, was then announced by a new clown (who
humorously said cauliflower act), and mr. sleary appeared, leading her
in.

mr. sleary had only made one cut at the clown with his long whip-lash,
and the clown had only said, â€˜if you do it again, iâ€™ll throw the horse at
you!â€™ when sissy was recognised both by father and daughter.  but they
got through the act with great self-possession; and mr. sleary, saving
for the first instant, conveyed

 no more expression into his locomotive
eye than into his fixed one.  the performance seemed a little long to
sissy and louisa, particularly when it stopped to afford the clown an
opportunity of telling mr. sleary (who said â€˜indeed, sir!â€™ to all his
observations in the calmest way, and with his eye on the house) about two
legs sitting on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four legs,
and laid hold of one leg, and up got two legs, caught hold of three legs,
and threw â€™em at four legs, who ran away with one leg.  for, although an
ingenious allegory relating to a butcher, a three-legged stool, a dog,
and a leg of mutton, this narrative consumed time; and they were in great
suspense.  at last,

however, little fair-haired josephine made her
curtsey amid great applause; and the clown, left alone in the ring, had
just warmed himself, and said, â€˜now _i_â€™ll have a turn!â€™ when sissy was
touched on the shoulder, and beckoned out.

she took louisa with her; and they were received by mr. sleary in a very
little private apartment, with canvas sides, a grass floor, and a wooden
ceiling all aslant, on which the box company stamped their approbation,
as if they were coming through.  â€˜thethilia,â€™ said mr. sleary, who had
brandy and water at hand, â€˜it doth me good to thee you.  you wath alwayth
a favourite with uth, and youâ€™ve done uth credith thinth the old timeth

these various changes, mr. sleary, very short of breath now, related with
great heartiness, and with a wonderful kind of innocence, considering
what a bleary and brandy-and-watery old veteran he was.  afterwards he
brought in josephine, and e. w. b. childers (rather deeply lined in the
jaws by daylight), and the little wonder of scholastic equitation, and in
a word, all the company.  amazing creatures they were in louisaâ€™s eyes,
so white and pink of complexion, so scant of dress, and so demonstrative
of leg; but it was very a

louisa, with many thanks and with a lightened load, detained mr. sleary
no longer then.  she left her love for her brother, with her eyes full of
tears; and she and sissy went away until later in the afternoon.

mr. gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards.  he too had encountered
no one whom he knew; and was now sanguine with slearyâ€™s assistance, of
getting his disgraced son to liverpool in the night.  as neither of the
three could be his companion without almost identifying him under any
disguise, he prepared a letter to a correspondent whom he could trust,

beseeching him to ship the bearer off at any cost, to north or south
america, or any distant part of the world to which he could be the most

this done, they walked about, waiting for the circus to be quite vacated;
not only by the audience, but by the company and by the horses.  after
watching it a long time, they saw mr. sleary bring out a chair and sit
down by the side-door, smoking; as if that were his signal that they
might approach.

â€˜your thervant, thquire,â€™ was his cautious salutation as they passed in.
â€˜if you want me youâ€™ll find me here.  you muthnâ€™t mind your thon having a
comic livery on.â€™

they all three went in; and mr. gradgrind sat down forlorn, on the
clownâ€™s performing chair in the middle of the ring.  on one of the back

fast closing in; and from time to time, he turned the whites of his eyes
restlessly and impatiently towards his father.  they were the only parts
of his face that showed any life or expression, the pigment upon it was
so thick.

â€˜you must be got to liverpool, and sent abroad.â€™

â€˜i suppose i must.  i canâ€™t be more miserable anywhere,â€™ whimpered the
whelp, â€˜than i have been here, ever since i can remember.  thatâ€™s one
thing.â€™

mr. gradgrind went to the door, and returned with sleary, to whom he
submitted the question, how to get this deplorable object away?

â€˜why, iâ€™ve been thinking of it, thquire.  thereâ€™th not muth time to

mr. gradgrind rapidly assented; mr. sleary rapidly turned out from a box,
a smock frock, a felt hat, and other essentials; the whelp rapidly
changed clothes behind a screen of baize; mr. sleary rapidly brought
beer, and washed him white again.

and going home just when i was in the greatest danger.  pretty love that!

they all confusedly went out: louisa crying to him that she forgave him,
and loved him still, and that he would one day be sorry to have left her
so, and glad to think of these her last words, far away: when some one
ran against them.  mr. gradgrind and sissy, who were both before him
while his sister yet clung to his shoulder, stopped and recoiled.

they went back into the booth, sleary shutting the door to keep intruders
out.  bitzer, still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in
the ring, blinking at his old patron through the darkness of the
twilight.

him, â€˜have you a heart?â€™

mr. sleary, who with his mouth open and his rolling eye as immovably
jammed in his head as his fixed one, had listened to these doctrines with
profound attention, here stepped forward.

â€˜thquire, you know perfectly well, and your daughter knowth perfectly
well (better than you, becauthe i thed it to her), that i didnâ€™t know
what your thon had done, and that i didnâ€™t want to knowâ€”i thed it wath
better not, though i only thought, then, it wath thome thkylarking.
however, thith young man having made

pony-gig coming up.  tell him, when he theeth that gig clothe by, to jump
down, and itâ€™ll take him off at a rattling pathe.  if my dog leth thith
young man thtir a peg on foot, i give him leave to go.  and if my horthe
ever thtirth from that thpot where he beginth a danthing, till the
morningâ€”i donâ€™t know him?â€”tharpâ€™th the word!â€™

the word was so sharp, that in ten minutes mr. childers, sauntering about
the market-place in a pair of slippers, had his cue, and mr. slearyâ€™s
equipage was ready.  it was a fine sight, to behold the learned dog
barking round it, and mr. sleary instructing him, with his one
practicable eye, that bitzer was the object of his particular attentions.
soon after dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog (a
formidable creature) already pinning bitzer with his eye, and sticking
close to the wheel on his side, that he might be ready for him in the
event of his showing the slightest disposition to alight.

the other three sat

up at the inn all night in great suspense.  at eight
oâ€™clock in the morning mr. sleary and the dog reappeared: both in high
spirits.

â€˜all right, thquire!â€™ said mr. sleary, â€˜your thon may be aboard-a-thip by
thith time.  childerth took him off, an hour and a half after we left
there latht night.  the horthe danthed the polka till he wath dead beat
(he would have walthed if he hadnâ€™t been in harneth), and then i gave him
the word and he went to thleep comfortable.  when that prethiouth young
rathcal thed heâ€™d go forâ€™ard afoot, the dog hung on to hith
neck-hankercher with all four legth in the air and pulled him down and
rolled him over.  tho he come back i

not reckoning luth, it would make â€™em happy.â€™

all these little tokens of his gratitude, mr. gradgrind very willingly
undertook to render.  though he thought them far too slight, he said, for
such a service.

â€˜very well, thquire; then, if youâ€™ll only give a horthe-riding, a
bethpeak, whenever you can, youâ€™ll more than balanthe the account.  now,
thquire, if your daughter will ethcuthe me, i thould like one parting
word with you.â€™

louisa and sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; mr. sleary, stirring
and drinking his brandy and water as he stood, went on:

â€˜thquire,â€”you donâ€™t need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth.â€™

â€˜their instinct,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜is surprising.â€™

â€˜whatever you call itâ€”and iâ€™m bletht if _i_ know what to call itâ€™â€”said
sleary, â€˜it ith athtonithing.  the way in whith a dogâ€™ll find youâ€”the
dithtanthe heâ€™ll come!â€™

â€˜his scent,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, â€˜being so fine.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m bletht if i know what to call it,

head, â€˜but i have had dogth find me, thquire, in a way that made me think
whether that dog hadnâ€™t gone to another dog, and thed, â€œyou donâ€™t happen
to know a perthon of the name of thleary, do you?  perthon of the name of
thleary, in the horthe-riding wayâ€”thtout manâ€”game eye?â€  and whether that
dog mightnâ€™t have thed, â€œwell, i canâ€™t thay i know him mythelf, but i

being afore the public, and going about tho muth, you thee, there mutht
be a number of dogth acquainted with me, thquire, that _i_ donâ€™t know!â€™

mr. gradgrind seemed to be quite confounded by this speculation.

â€˜any way,â€™ said sleary, after putting his lips to his brandy and water,
â€˜ith fourteen month ago, thquire, thinthe we wath at chethter.  we wath
getting up our children in the wood one morning, when there cometh into
our ring, by the thtage door, a dog.  he had travelled a long way, he
wath in a very bad condithon, he wath lame, and pretty well blind.  he
went round to our children, one after another, as if he wath a theeking
for a child he knowâ€™d; and then he come to me, and throwd hithelf up
behind, and thtood o

â€˜she keeps the bottle that he sent her for, to this hour; and she will
believe in his affection to the last moment of her life,â€™ said mr.
gradgrind.

â€˜it theemth to prethent two thingth to a perthon, donâ€™t it, thquire?â€™
said mr. sleary, musing as he looked down into the depths of his brandy
and water: â€˜one, that there ith a love in the world, not all
thelf-interetht after all, but thomething very different; tâ€™other, that
it bath a way of ith own of calculating or not calculating, whith
thomehow or another ith at leatht ath hard to give a name to, ath the
wayth of the dogth ith!â€™

mr. gradgrind looked out of window, and made no reply.  mr. sleary
emptied his glass and recalled the ladies.

door again to say it, â€˜that i wath tho muth of a cackler!â€™



chapter ix
final


it is a dangerous thing to see anything in the sphere of a vain
blusterer, before the vain blusterer sees it himself.  mr. bounderby felt
that mrs. sparsit had audaciously anticipated him, and presumed to be
wiser than he.  inappeasably indignant with her for her triumphant
discovery of mrs. pegler, he turned this presumption, on the part of a
woman in her dependent position, over an
