owing that there was nothing to learn -- and then 
went on to what she really wanted to say: that she would not on any account 
have gone but that the box had been taken and helen and their daughter were 
going, as well as petrishchev (the examining magistrate, their daughter's fiancé) 
and that it was out of the question to let them go alone; but that she would have 
much preferred to sit with him for a while; and he must be sure to follow the 
doctor's orders while she was away.  
 
"oh, and fedor petrovich" (the fiancé) "would like to come in. may he? and 
lisa?"  

 
"all right."  
 
their daughter came in in full evening dress, her fresh young flesh exposed 
(making a show of that very flesh which in his own case caused so much 
suffering), strong, healthy, evidently in love, and impatient with illness, suffering, 
and death, because they interfered with her happiness.  
 
fedor petrovich came in too, in evening dress, his hair curled a la capoul, a tight 
stiff collar round his long sinewy n

his son had always seemed pathetic to him, and now it was dreadful to see the 
boy's frightened look of pity. it seemed to ivan ilyich that vasya was the only one 
besides gerasim who understood and pitied him.  
 
they all sat down and again asked how he was. a silence followed. lisa asked 
her mother about the opera glasses, and there was an altercation between 
mother and daughter as to who had taken them and where they had been put. 
this occasioned some unpleasantness.  
 
fedor petrovich inquired of ivan ilyich whether he had ever seen sarah 
bernhardt. ivan ilyich did not at first catch the question, but then replied: "no, 
have you seen her before?"  
 
"yes, in adrienne lecouvreur." 
 
praskovya fedorovna mentioned some roles in which sarah bernhardt was 
particularly good. her daughter disagreed. conversation sprang up as to the

staring with glittering eyes straight before him, evidently indignant with them. this

"well, if we are going it's time to start," she said, looking at her watch, a present 
from her father, and with a faint and significant smile at fedor petrovich relating 
to something known only to them. she got up with a rustle of her dress.  
 
they all rose, said goodnight, and went away.  
 
when they had gone it seemed to ivan ilyich that he felt better; the falsity had 
gone with them. but the pain remained -- that same pain and that same fear that 
made everything monotonously alike, nothing harder and nothing easier. 
everything was worse.
