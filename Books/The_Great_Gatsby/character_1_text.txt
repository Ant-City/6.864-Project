 at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.

i had been actually invited. a chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg blue crossed my lawn early that saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer--the honor would be entirely gatsby's, it said, if i would attend his "little party" that night. he had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it--signed jay gatsby in a majestic hand.

dressed up in white flannels i went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies of people i didn't know--though here and there was a face i had noticed on the commuting train. i was immediately struck by the number of young englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous americans. i was sure that they were selling something: bonds or

ople. it appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from montenegro's warm little heart. my incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.

he reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.

"that's the one from montenegro."

to my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.

orderi di danilo, ran the circular legend, montenegro, nicolas rex.

"turn it."

major jay gatsby, i read, for valour extraordinary.

"here's another thing i always carry. a souvenir of oxford days. it was taken in trinity quad--the man on my left is now the earl of dorcaster."

it was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. there was gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.

then it was all true. i saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the grand canal; i saw him openi

 there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me." he hesitated. "you'll hear about it this afternoon."

"at lunch?"

"no, this afternoon. i happened to find out that you're taking miss baker to tea."

"do you mean you're in love with miss baker?"

"no, old sport, i'm not. but miss baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter."

i hadn't the faintest idea what "this matter" was, but i was more annoyed than interested. i hadn't asked jordan to tea in order to discuss mr. jay gatsby. i was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment i was sorry i'd ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.

he wouldn't say another word. his correctness grew on him as we neared the city. we passed port roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and i had a glimpse of mrs. wil

llo jordan," she called unexpectedly. "please come here."

i was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls i admired her most. she asked me if i was going to the red cross and make bandages. i was. well, then, would i tell them that she couldn't come that day? the officer looked at daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me i have remembered the incident ever since. his name was jay gatsby and i didn't lay eyes on him again for over four years--even after i'd met him on long island i didn't realize it was the same man.

that was nineteen-seventeen. by the next year i had a few beaux myself, and i began to play in tournaments, so i didn't see daisy very often. she went with a slightly older crowd--when she went with anyone at all. wild rumors were circulating about her--how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to new york and say goodbye to a soldier who

 these inventions were a source of satisfaction to james gatz of north dakota, isn't easy to say.

james gatz--that was really, or at least legally, his name. he had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career--when he saw dan cody's yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on lake superior. it was james gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already jay gatsby who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the tuolomee and informed cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.

i suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. his parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people--his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. the truth was that jay gatsby, of west egg, long island, sprang from his platonic conception of himself. he was a son of god--a phrase which, if it means anything, means just th

at--and he must be about his father's business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. so he invented just the sort of jay gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.

for over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of lake superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. his brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days. he knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they we

as indirectly due to cody that gatsby drank so little. sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.

and it was from cody that he inherited money--a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. he didn't get it. he never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to ella kaye. he was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of jay gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.


he told me all this very much later, but i've put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which weren't even faintly true. moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when i had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. so i take advantage of this short halt, while gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.

it was a halt, too, in my

dows of the drawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness.

"you ought to go away," i said. "it's pretty certain they'll trace your car."

"go away now, old sport?"

"go to atlantic city for a week, or up to montreal."

he wouldn't consider it. he couldn't possibly leave daisy until he knew what she was going to do. he was clutching at some last hope and i couldn't bear to shake him free.

it was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with dan cody--told it to me because "jay gatsby" had broken up like glass against tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out. i think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about daisy.

she was the first "nice" girl he had ever known. in various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. he found her excitingly desirable. he went to her house, at first with other officers from camp taylor, then alone. i

mances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. it excited him too that many men had already loved daisy--it increased her value in his eyes. he felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.

but he knew that he was in daisy's house by a colossal accident. however glorious might be his future as jay gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. so he made the most of his time. he took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously--eventually he took daisy one still october night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.

he might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses. i don't mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had delib
