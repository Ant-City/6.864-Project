for hope, wide-ranging, that brings good to some, 
to many is a false lure of desire 560 

lijjht-minded, giddy; and until the fire 
scorches their feet, they know not what will come. 

wise is the famous adage: that to one 
whom the gods madden, evil, soon or late, 

seems good; then can he but a moment shun 
the stroke of fate. 

but haemon comes, of your two sons the last. 
is his heart heavy for the sentence passed 

upon antigone, his promised bride, 
and for his hope of marriage now denied? 570 

enter haemon 
creon: 

we soon shall know better than seers could tell us. 

my son, antigone is condemned to death. 

nothing can change my sentence. have you learned 

her fate and come here in a storm of anger, 

or do you love me and support my acts? 
haemon: 

father, i am your son. your greater knowledge 

will trace the pathway

 that i mean to follow. 

my marriage cannot be of more importance 

than to be guided always by your wisdom. 



creon: 



yes, haemon, this should be the law vou live by! 580 

in all things to obey your father's will. 

men pray for children round them in their homes 

only to see them dutiful and quick 

with hatred to requite their father's foe, 

with honor to repav their father's friend. 

but what is there to say of one whose children 

prove to be valueless? that he has fathered 

grief for himself and laughter for his foes. 

then, haemon, do not, at the lure of pleasure, 

unseat your reason for a woman's sake. 500

ut disobedience is the worst of evils. 

for it is this that ruins cities; this 

.makes our homes desolate; armies of allies 

through this break up in rout. but most men find 

their happiness and safety in obedience. 

therefore we must support the law, and never 620 

be beaten by a woman. it is better 

to fall by a man's hand, if we must fall, 

than to be known as weaker than a girl. 
chorus: 

we may in our old age have lost our judgment, 

and yet to us you seem to have spoken wisely. 
haemon: 

the gods have given men the gift of reason, 

greatest of all things that we call our own. 

i have no skill, nor do i wish to have it, 

to show where you have spoken wrongly. yet 

some other's thought, beside your own, might prove 630 

to be of value. therefore it is my duty, 

my natural duty as your son, to notice, 

on your behalf, all that men say, or do. 

or find to blame. for your frown frightens them, 

so that the citizen dares not say a word 

that would offend you. i can hear,

let your resentment die. let yourself change. 

for i believe— if i, a younger man, 

may have a sound opinion— it is best 

that men by nature should be wise in all things. 

but most men find they cannot reach that goal; 670 

and when this happens, it is also good 

to learn to listen to wise counselors. 
chorus: 

sir, when his words are timely, you should heed them. 

and haemon, you should profit by his words. 

each one of you has spoken reasonably. 
creon: 

are men as old as i am to be taught 

how to behave by men as young as he? 
haemon: 

not to do wrong. if i am young, ignore 

my youth. consider only what i do. 
creon: 

have you done well in honoring the rebellious? 680 

haemon: 

those who do wrong should not command respect. 
creon: 

then that disease has not infected her?

drew near, there floated through the air a voice,

the king burst out in anguish: 'can it be

will this be the saddest road i ever trod?

antigone 

we followed our despairing master's bidding 1150 

and in the farthest recess of the tomb 

we found antigone, hanging, with her veil 

noosed round her neck. and with her we found haemon, 

his arms flung round her waist, grieving aloud 

for his bride lost in death, his ruined marriage, 

his father's deeds. but when his father saw him, 

creon cried piteously and going in, 

called to him brokenly: 'my son, my son,

but haemon glared at him with furious eyes 

instead of answering, spat in his face, 

and drew his sword. his father turned to fly 

so that he missed his aim. immediately, 

in bitter self-reproach, the wretched boy 

leaned hard against his sword, and drove it deep 

into his side. then while his life yet lingered, 

with failing strength he drew antigone close; 

and as he lay there gasping heavily, n 70

then i will enter. perhaps she is concealing 

some secret purpose in her passionate heart. 

i will find out, for you are right in saying 

too great a silence may be ominous.
