Virgil - 
                Dante's
guide through the depths of Hell. Historically, Virgil lived in
the first century b.c., in what is now northern
Italy. Scholars consider him the greatest of the Latin poets. His
masterpiece, the Aeneid, tells the story of how
Aeneas, along with fellow survivors of the defeat of Troy, came
to found Rome. The shade (or spirit) of Virgil that appears in Inferno has
been condemned to an eternity in Hell because he lived prior to
Christ's appearance on Earth (and thus prior to the possibility
of redemption in Him). Nonetheless, Virgil has now received orders
to lead Dante through Hell on his spiritual journey. Virgil proves
a wise, resourceful, and commanding presence, but he often seems
helpless to protect Dante from the true dangers of Hell. Critics generally
consider Virgil an allegorical representation of human reason--both
in its immense power and in its inferiority to faith in God.
