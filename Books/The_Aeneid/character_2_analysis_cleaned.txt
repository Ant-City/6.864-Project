[CHARACTER] 
[CHARACTER] is a counterpart to dido, another of
juno's proteges who must eventually perish in order for aeneas to
fulfill his destiny. both [CHARACTER] and dido represent forces of irrationality
in contrast to aeneas's pious sense of order. dido is undone by
her romantic desire, [CHARACTER] by his unrelenting rage and pride. he
is famous for courage and skill in battle, and justly so: he has
all the elements of a hero.
what distinguishes [CHARACTER] from aeneas, besides
his unmitigated fury in battle, is his willfulness. he tries to
carve out his own understanding of history with his prediction of
his own success, based on the events of the trojan past, as told
in homer's iliad. though [CHARACTER] may appear to us
a latin version of achilles, the raging hero of the iliad, [CHARACTER]'s
powers as a warrior are not enough to guarantee him victory. jupiter
has decreed another destiny for [CHARACTER], an outcome [CHARACTER] refuses
to accept. [CHARACTER]'s interpretation of signs and omens is similarly
stubborn. he interprets them to his own advantage rather than seeking
their true meaning, as aeneas does.

[CHARACTER]'s character changes in the last few battle scenes,
when we see him gradually lose confidence as he comes to understand
and accept his tragic fate. he is angry earlier when juno tries
to protect him by luring him out of the battle and onto a ship.
in this episode she humiliates him, making him look like a coward
rather than the hero he so desperately wants to be. by the final
scenes, however, his resistance to the aid of juturna, his sister,
is motivated no longer by a fiery determination to fight but by
a quiet resolve to meet his fate and die honorably.
