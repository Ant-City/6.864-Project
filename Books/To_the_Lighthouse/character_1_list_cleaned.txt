mr.[CHARACTER] - 
                 mrs.
ramsay's husband, and a prominent metaphysical philosopher. mr.
ramsay loves his family but often acts like something of a tyrant.
he tends to be selfish and harsh due to his persistent personal
and professional anxieties. he fears, more than anything, that his
work is insignificant in the grand scheme of things and that he
will not be remembered by future generations. well aware of how
blessed he is to have such a wonderful family, he nevertheless tends
to punish his wife, children, and guests by demanding their constant
sympathy, attention, and support.
