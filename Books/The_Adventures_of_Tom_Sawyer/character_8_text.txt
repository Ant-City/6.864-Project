pproached through the gloom, swinging an
old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
little spangles of light. presently huckleberry whispered with a
shudder:

ï¿½itï¿½s the devils sure enough. three of ï¿½em! lordy, tom, weï¿½re goners!
can you pray?ï¿½

ï¿½iï¿½ll try, but donï¿½t you be afeard. they ainï¿½t going to hurt us. ï¿½now i
lay me down to sleep, i--ï¿½ï¿½

ï¿½sh!ï¿½

ï¿½what is it, huck?ï¿½

ï¿½theyï¿½re _humans_! one of ï¿½em is, anyway. one of ï¿½emï¿½s old muff potterï¿½s
voice.ï¿½

ï¿½no--ï¿½tainï¿½t so, is it?ï¿½

ï¿½i bet i know it. donï¿½t you stir nor budge. he ainï¿½t sharp enough to
notice us. drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!ï¿½

ï¿½all right, iï¿½ll keep still. now theyï¿½re stuck. canï¿½t find it. here they
come again. now theyï¿½re hot. cold again. hot again. red hot! theyï¿½re
pï¿½inted right, this time. say, huck, i know another oï¿½ them voices; itï¿½s
injun joe.ï¿½

ï¿½thatï¿½s so--that murderinï¿½ half-breed! iï¿½d druther the

i never used a weepon in my life before, joe. iï¿½ve fought, but never
with weepons. theyï¿½ll all say that. joe, donï¿½t tell! say you wonï¿½t tell,
joe--thatï¿½s a good feller. i always liked you, joe, and stood up for you,
too. donï¿½t you remember? you _wonï¿½t_ tell, _will_ you, joe?ï¿½ and the
poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and
clasped his appealing hands.

ï¿½no, youï¿½ve always been fair and square with me, muff potter, and i
wonï¿½t go back on you. there, now, thatï¿½s as fair as a man can say.ï¿½

ï¿½oh, joe, youï¿½re an angel. iï¿½ll bless you for this the longest day i
live.ï¿½ and potter began to cry.

ï¿½come, now, thatï¿½s enough of that. this ainï¿½t any time for blubbering.
you be off yonder way and iï¿½ll go this. move, now, and donï¿½t leave any
tracks behind you.ï¿½

potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. the half-breed
stood looking after him. he muttered:

ï¿½if heï¿½s as much

ï¿½huckleberry, what do you reckonï¿½ll come of this?ï¿½

ï¿½if doctor robinson dies, i reckon hangingï¿½ll come of it.ï¿½

ï¿½do you though?ï¿½

ï¿½why, i _know_ it, tom.ï¿½

tom thought a while, then he said:

ï¿½whoï¿½ll tell? we?ï¿½

ï¿½what are you talking about? sï¿½pose something happened and injun joe
_didnï¿½t_ hang? why, heï¿½d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure
as weï¿½re a laying here.ï¿½

ï¿½thatï¿½s just what i was thinking to myself, huck.ï¿½

ï¿½if anybody tells, let muff potter do it, if heï¿½s fool enough. heï¿½s
generally drunk enough.ï¿½

tom said nothing--went on thinking. presently he whispered:

ï¿½huck, muff potter donï¿½t know it. how can he tell?ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½s the reason he donï¿½t know it?ï¿½

ï¿½because heï¿½d just got that whack when injun joe done it. dï¿½you reckon
he could see anything? dï¿½you reckon he knowed anything?ï¿½

ï¿½by hokey, thatï¿½s so, tom!ï¿½

ï¿½and besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_!ï¿½

ï¿½no, ï¿½taint likely, tom

. he had liquor in him; i could see that; and
besides, he always has. well, when papï¿½s full, you might take and belt
him over the head with a church and you couldnï¿½t phase him. he says so,
his own self. so itï¿½s the same with muff potter, of course. but if a man
was dead sober, i reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; i dono.ï¿½

after another reflective silence, tom said:

ï¿½hucky, you sure you can keep mum?ï¿½

ï¿½tom, we _got_ to keep mum. you know that. that injun devil wouldnï¿½t
make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak
ï¿½bout this and they didnï¿½t hang him. now, look-a-here, tom, less take
and swear to one another--thatï¿½s what we got to do--swear to keep mum.ï¿½

ï¿½iï¿½m agreed. itï

d?ï¿½

ï¿½i donï¿½t like to, much. tom, sï¿½pose itï¿½s injun joe!ï¿½

tom quailed. but presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their
heels if the snoring stopped. so they went tiptoeing stealthily down,
the one behind the other. when they had got to within five steps of the
snorer, tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. the man
moaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. it was
muff potter. the boysï¿½ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,
when the man moved, but their fears passed away now. they tip-toed out,
through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance
to exchange a parting word. that long, lugubrious howl rose on the night
air again! they turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
feet of where potter was lying, and _facing_ potter, with his nose
pointing heavenward.

ï¿½oh, geeminy, itï¿½s _him_!ï¿½ exclaimed both boys, in a breath.

chapter xi

close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
with the ghastly news. no need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;
the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,
with little less than telegraphic speed. of course the schoolmaster gave
holi-day for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of
him if he had not.

a gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been
recognized by somebody as belonging to muff potter--so the story ran. and
it was said that a belated citizen had come upon potter washing himself
in the ï¿½branchï¿½ about one or two oï¿½clock in the morning, and that potter
had at once sneaked off--suspicious circumstances, especially the washing
which was not a habit with potter. it was also said that the town had
been ransacked for this ï¿½murdererï¿½ (the public are not slow in the
matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he
could not be found. horsemen had departed d

d at the dreadful place, he
wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.
it seemed to him an age since he was there before. somebody pinched
his arm. he turned, and his eyes met huckleberryï¿½s. then both looked
elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their
mutual glance. but everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly
spectacle before them.

ï¿½poor fellow!ï¿½ ï¿½poor young fellow!ï¿½ ï¿½this ought to be a lesson to grave
robbers!ï¿½ ï¿½muff potterï¿½ll hang for this if they catch him!ï¿½ this was the
drift of remark; and the minister said, ï¿½it was a judgment; his hand is
here.ï¿½

now tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid
face of injun joe. at this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,
and voices shouted, ï¿½itï¿½s him! itï¿½s him! heï¿½s coming himself!ï¿½

ï¿½who? who?ï¿½ from twenty voices.

ï¿½muff potter!ï¿½

ï¿½hallo, heï¿½s stopped!--look out, heï¿½s turning! donï¿½t let him get away!ï¿½

 his face.

they inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should
offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.

injun joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in
a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering
crowd that the wound bled a little! the boys thought that this happy
circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were
disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:

ï¿½it was within three feet of muff potter when it done it.ï¿½

tomï¿½s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning sid said:

ï¿½tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
awake half the time.ï¿½

tom blanched and dropped his eyes.

ï¿½itï¿½s a bad sign,ï¿½ said aunt polly, gravely. ï¿½what you got on your mind,
tom?ï¿½

ï¿½nothing. nothing ï¿½t i know of.ï¿½ but the boyï¿½s hand shook so that he
spilled his coffee.

ï¿½and you do ta

use:

ï¿½huck, they couldnï¿½t anybody get you to tell, could they?ï¿½

ï¿½get me to tell? why, if i wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they
could get me to tell. they ainï¿½t no different way.ï¿½

ï¿½well, thatï¿½s all right, then. i reckon weï¿½re safe as long as we keep
mum. but letï¿½s swear again, anyway. itï¿½s more surer.ï¿½

ï¿½iï¿½m agreed.ï¿½

so they swore again with dread solemnities.

ï¿½what is the talk around, huck? iï¿½ve heard a power of it.ï¿½

ï¿½talk? well, itï¿½s just muff potter, muff potter, muff potter all the
time. it keeps me in a sweat, constant, soï¿½s i want to hide somï¿½ers.ï¿½

ï¿½thatï¿½s just the same way they go on round me. i reckon heï¿½s a goner.
donï¿½t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?ï¿½

ï¿½most always--most always. he ainï¿½t no account; but then he hainï¿½t ever
done anything to hurt anybody. just fishes a little, to get money to
get drunk on--and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do
that--leastways most of us--preachers and such like.

ut what i want to say, is, donï¿½t _you_ ever get drunk--then you wonï¿½t
ever get here. stand a litter furder west--so--thatï¿½s it; itï¿½s a prime
comfort to see faces thatï¿½s friendly when a bodyï¿½s in such a muck
of trouble, and there donï¿½t none come here but yourn. good friendly
faces--good friendly faces. git up on one anotherï¿½s backs and let me
touch ï¿½em. thatï¿½s it. shake hands--yournï¿½ll come through the bars, but
mineï¿½s too big. little hands, and weak--but theyï¿½ve helped muff potter a
power, and theyï¿½d help him more if they could.ï¿½

tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.
the next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an
almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.
huck was having the same experience. they studiously avoided each other.
each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination
always brought them back presently. tom kept his ears open when idlers
sauntered ou

in, with chains upon him, and seated where all
the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was injun joe,
stolid as ever. there was another pause, and then the judge arrived and
the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. the usual whisperings
among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. these
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
that was as impressive as it was fascinating.

now a witness was called who testified that he found muff potter washing
in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was
discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. after some further
questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:

ï¿½take the witness.ï¿½

the prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when
his own counsel said:

ï¿½i have no questions to ask him.ï¿½

the next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.
counsel for the prosecution said:

nï¿½t skip anything,
and donï¿½t be afraid.ï¿½

tom began--hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his
words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased
but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and
bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,
rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. the strain upon pent
emotion reached its climax when the boy said:

ï¿½--and as the doctor fetched the board around and muff potter fell, injun
joe jumped with the knife and--ï¿½

crash! quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his
way through all opposers, and was gone!




chapter xxiv

tom was a glittering hero once more--the pet of the old, the envy of the
young. his name even went into immortal print, for the village paper
magnified him. there were some that believed he would be president, yet,
if he escaped hanging.

as usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took muff potter to its bosom
and fondled hi

k was sore afraid
that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding
injun joeï¿½s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.
the poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of
that? since tomï¿½s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
lawyerï¿½s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had
been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, huckï¿½s
confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.

daily muff potterï¿½s gratitude made tom glad he had spoken; but nightly
he wished he had sealed up his tongue.

half the time tom was afraid injun joe would never be captured; the
other half he was afraid he would be. he felt sure he never could draw a
safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.

rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no injun
joe was found. one of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels, a
detective, came up from st. louis, moused around, shook
