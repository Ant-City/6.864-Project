off to a tee with his eyes screwed up. do you know what i’m going to
tell you? what’s that, mr o’rourke? do you know what? the russians,
they’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the japanese.

stop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. sad thing about poor

stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely
by asking:

just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companion’s boot but
stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected
quarter, answered:

—dedalus.

the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,
rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old
hollands and water.

—you know simon dedalus? he asked at length.

—i’ve heard of him, stephen said.

mr bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently
eavesdropping too.

—he’s irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same
way and nodding. all irish.

as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business
and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor
of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with
