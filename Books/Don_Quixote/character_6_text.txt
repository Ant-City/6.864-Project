t in this shadow, though deprived
of that precious ornament of elegance and erudition that clothe the works
composed in the houses of those who know, it dares appear with assurance
in the judgment of some who, trespassing the bounds of their own
ignorance, use to condemn with more rigour and less justice the writings
of others. it is my earnest hope that your excellency's good counsel in
regard to my honourable purpose, will not disdain the littleness of so
humble a service.

in a village of la mancha, the name of which i have no desire to call to
mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance
in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for
coursing. an olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most
nights, scraps on saturdays, lentils on fridays, and a pigeon or so extra

"the author of that book, too," said the curate, "is a great friend of
mine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who
hear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when
he chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is
good was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been
set apart. but what book is that next it?"

"the 'galatea' of miguel de cervantes," said the barber.

"that cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my
knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. his book
has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but brings
nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the second part it promises:
perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of
grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you, senor gossip,
keep it shut up in your own quarters."

these were all the verses that could be deciphered; the rest, the writing
being worm-eaten, were handed over to one of the academicians to make out
their meaning conjecturally. we have been informed that at the cost of
many sleepless nights and much toil he has succeeded, and that he means
to publish them in hopes of don quixote's third sally.

the author's preface

god bless me, gentle (or it may be plebeian) reader, how eagerly must
thou be looking forward to this preface, expecting to find there
retaliation, scolding, and abuse against the author of the second don
quixote--i mean him who was, they say, begotten at tordesillas and born
at tarragona! well then, the truth is, i am not going to give thee that
satisfaction; for, though injuries stir up anger in humbler breasts, in
mine the
