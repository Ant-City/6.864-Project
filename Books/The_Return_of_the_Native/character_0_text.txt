“well, i can’t understand a quiet ladylike little body like tamsin yeobright caring to be married in such a mean way,” said susan nunsuch, the wide woman, who preferred the original subject. “‘tis worse than the poorest do. and i shouldn’t have cared about the man, though some may say he’s good-looking.”
“to give him his due he’s a clever, learned fellow in his way—a’most as clever as clym yeobright used to be. he was brought up to better things than keeping the quiet woman. an engineer—that’s what the man was, as we know; but he threw away his chance, and so ‘a took a public house to live. his learning was no use to him at all.”

he had been there this evening. “i suppose you have heard the egdon news, eustacia?” he said, without looking up from the bottles. “the men have been talking about it at the woman as if it were of national importance.”
“i have heard none,” she said.
“young clym yeobright, as they call him, is coming home next week to spend christmas with his mother. he is a fine fellow by this time, it seems. i suppose you remember him?”
“i never saw him in my life.”
“ah, true; he left before you came here. i well remember him as a promising boy.”
“where has he been living all these years?”
“in that rookery of pomp and vanity, paris, i believe.”

o, so i’ve heard his mother say—like a king’s palace, as far as diments go.”
“i can well mind when he left home,” said sam.
“‘tis a good thing for the feller,” said humphrey. “a sight of times better to be selling diments than nobbling about here.”
“it must cost a good few shillings to deal at such a place.”
“a good few indeed, my man,” replied the captain. “yes, you may make away with a deal of money and be neither drunkard nor glutton.”
“they say, too, that clym yeobright is become a real perusing man, with the strangest notions about things. there, that’s because he went to school early, such as the school was.”
“strange notions, has he?” said the old man. “ah, there’s too much of that sending to school in these days! it only does harm. every gatepost and barn’s door you come to is sure to have some bad word or other chalked upon it by the young rascals—a woman can hardly pass for shame sometimes. if they’d never been taught how to write they

wouldn’t have been able to scribble such villainy. their fathers couldn’t do it, and the country was all the better for it.”
“now, i should think, cap’n, that miss eustacia had about as much in her head that comes from books as anybody about here?”
“perhaps if miss eustacia, too, had less romantic nonsense in her head it would be better for her,” said the captain shortly; after which he walked away.
“i say, sam,” observed humphrey when the old man was gone, “she and clym yeobright would make a very pretty pigeon-pair—hey? if they wouldn’t i’ll be dazed! both of one mind about niceties for certain, and learned in print, and always thinking about high doctrine—there couldn’t be a better couple if they were made o’ purpose. clym’s family is as good as hers. his father was a farmer, that’s true; but his mother was a sort of lady, as we know. nothing would please me better than to see them two man and wife.”
“they’d look very natty, arm-in-crook together

people who came to these few isolated houses to keep christmas with their friends remained in their friends’ chimney-corners drinking mead and other comforting liquors till they left again for good and all. rain, snow, ice, mud everywhere around, they did not care to trudge two or three miles to sit wet-footed and splashed to the nape of their necks among those who, though in some measure neighbours, lived close to the church, and entered it clean and dry. eustacia knew it was ten to one that clym yeobright would go to no church at all during his few days of leave, and that it would be a waste of labour for her to go driving the pony and gig over a bad road in hope to see him there.
it was dusk, and she was sitting by the fire in the dining-room or hall, which they occupied at this time of the year in preference to the parlour, because of its large hearth, constructed for turf-fires, a fuel the captain was partial to in the winter season. the only visible articles in the room were those on the win

nd immediate desire. the other mummers appeared to be in no hurry to leave; and murmuring to the lad who sat next to her that she preferred waiting for them outside the house, she moved to the door as imperceptibly as possible, opened it, and slipped out.
the calm, lone scene reassured her. she went forward to the palings and leant over them, looking at the moon. she had stood thus but a little time when the door again opened. expecting to see the remainder of the band eustacia turned; but no—clym yeobright came out as softly as she had done, and closed the door behind him.
he advanced and stood beside her. “i have an odd opinion,” he said, “and should like to ask you a question. are you a woman—or am i wrong?”
“i am a woman.”
his eyes lingered on her with great interest. “do girls often play as mummers now? they never used to.”
“they don’t now.”
“why did you?”
“to get excitement and shake off depression,” she said in low tones.
“what depressed you?”
“life.”

r more. at the end of the time mrs. yeobright went in, and venn sadly retraced his steps into the heath. when he had again regained his van he lit the lantern, and with an apathetic face at once began to pull off his best clothes, till in the course of a few minutes he reappeared as the confirmed and irretrievable reddleman that he had seemed before.

on that evening the interior of blooms-end, though cosy and comfortable, had been rather silent. clym yeobright was not at home. since the christmas party he had gone on a few days’ visit to a friend about ten miles off.
the shadowy form seen by venn to part from wildeve in the porch, and quickly withdraw into the house, was thomasin’s. on entering she threw down a cloak which had been carelessly wrapped round her, and came forward to the light, where mrs. yeobright sat at her work-table, drawn up within the settle, so that part of it projected into the chimney-corner.

 was deficient in one significant particular, which had escaped him through his being at some distance back in the church. when thomasin was tremblingly engaged in signing her name wildeve had flung towards eustacia a glance that said plainly, “i have punished you now.” she had replied in a low tone—and he little thought how truly—“you mistake; it gives me sincerest pleasure to see her your wife today.”




book three — the fascination





1—“my mind to me a kingdom is”

in clym yeobright’s face could be dimly seen the typical countenance of the future. should there be a classic period to art hereafter, its pheidias may produce such faces. the view of life as a thing to be put up with, replacing that zest for existence which was so intense in early civilizations, must ultimately enter so thoroughly into the constitution of the advanced races that its facial expression will become accepted as a new artistic departure. people already feel that a man who lives without disturbing

he had been a lad of whom something was expected. beyond this all had been chaos. that he would be successful in an original way, or that he would go to the dogs in an original way, seemed equally probable. the only absolute certainty about him was that he would not stand still in the circumstances amid which he was born.
hence, when his name was casually mentioned by neighbouring yeomen, the listener said, “ah, clym yeobright—what is he doing now?” when the instinctive question about a person is, what is he doing? it is felt that he will be found to be, like most of us, doing nothing in particular. there is an indefinite sense that he must be invading some region of singularity, good or bad. the devout hope is that he is doing well. the secret faith is that he is making a mess of it. half a dozen comfortable market-men, who were habitual callers at the quiet woman as they passed by in their carts, were partial t
