[CHARACTER] - 
                gulliver's
cousin, self-proclaimed intimate friend,
and the editor and publisher of gulliver's travels. it
was in [CHARACTER]'s name that jonathan swift arranged for the
publication of his narrative, thus somewhat mixing the fictional
and actual worlds. sympson is the fictional author of the prefatory
note to gulliver's travels, entitled "the publisher
to the readers." this note justifies sympson's elimination of nearly
half of the original manuscript material on the grounds that it
was irrelevant, a statement that swift includes so as to allow us
to doubt gulliver's overall wisdom and ability to distinguish between
important facts and trivial details.
