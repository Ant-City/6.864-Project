lil and there was no point in staying to
be killed. i don't think i could fight a field mouse."
     "do you know me?" said hazel. but before the other could answer, dandelion
and bigwig came out of the darkness. bigwig stared at holly for a moment and
then crouched before him and touched noses.

     "holly, this is thlayli," he said. "you were calling me."
     holly did not answer, but only stared fixedly back at him. bigwig looked up.
"who's that who came with him?" he said. "oh, it's you, bluebell. how many
more of you?"
     "no more," said bluebell. he was about to go on when holly spoke.
     "thlayli," he said. "so we have found you."
     he sat up with difficulty and looked around at them.
     "you're hazel, aren't you?" he asked. "and that's -- oh, i should know, but i'm
in very poor shape, i'm afraid."
     "it's dandelion," said hazel. "listen -- i can see that you're exhausted, but we
can't stay here. we're in danger. can you come with us to our holes?"
     "captain," said bl

blade of grass?"
     hazel looked at him sharply, but holly replied, "well?"
     "it said, 'look, there's a rabbit! we're in danger!'"
     "this is no time--" began hazel.
     "don't silence him," said holly. "we wouldn't be here at all without his blue
tit's chatter. yes, i can go now. is it far?"
     "not too far," said hazel, thinking it all too likely that holly would never get
there.
     it took a long time to climb the hill. hazel made them separate, himself
remaining with holly and bluebell while bigwig and dandelion went out to either
side. holly was forced to stop several times and hazel, full of fear, had hard work
to suppress his impatience. only when the moon began to rise -- the edge of its
great disc growing brighter and brighter on the skyline below and behind them --
did he at last beg holly to hurry. as he spoke he saw, in the white light, pipkin
coming down to meet them.
     "what are you doing?" he said sternly. "i told speedwell no one was to come
down."
     "it isn

wig. "these two will need to rest for a good long
time. suppose pipkin here and dandelion take them to an empty burrow and stay
with them as long as they want? the rest of us had better keep away until they
feel better."
     "yes, that's best," said hazel. "i'll go up with you now."
     they ran the short distance to the thorn trees. all the other rabbits were above
ground, waiting and whispering together.
     "shut up," said bigwig, before anyone had asked a question. "yes, it is holly,
and bluebell is with him -- no one else. they're in a bad way and they're not to be
troubled. we'll leave this hole empty for them. now i'm going underground
myself and so will you if you've got any sense."
     but before he went, bigwig turned to hazel and said, "you got yourself out of
that ditch down there instead of me, didn't you, hazel? i shan't forget that."
     hazel remembered buckthorn's leg and took him down with him. speedwell

and silver followed them.

sked silver. "it must be something very bad.
holly would never leave the threarah."
     "i don't know," replied hazel, "and neither does anyone else yet. we'll have to
wait until tomorow. holly may stop running, but i don't think bluebell will. now
let me alone to do this leg of buckthorn's."
     the wound was a great deal better and soon hazel fell asleep.
     the next day was as hot and cloudless as the last. neither pipkin nor
dandelion was at morning silflay; and hazel relentlessly took the others up to the
beech hanger to go on with the digging. he questioned strawberry about the great
burrow and learned that its ceiling, as well as being vaulted with a tangle of
fibers, was strengthened by roots going vertically down int

 was about to speak again when dandelion appeared in the mouth of the
hole. he looked at the mouse, pushed it gently aside and came down the run.
     "hazel," he said, "i thought i ought to come and tell you about holly. he's
much better this evening, but he had a very bad night and so did we. every time
he seemed to be going to sleep, he kept starting up and crying. i thought he was
going out of his mind. pipkin kept talking to him -- he was first-rate -- and he
seems to set a lot of store by bluebell. bluebell kept on making jokes. he was
worn out before the morning and so were the lot of us -- we've been sleeping all
day. holly's been more or less himself since he woke up this afternoon, and he's
been up to silflay. he asked where you and the others would be tonight and, as i
didn't know, i came to ask."
     "is he fit to talk to us, then?" asked bigwig.
     "i think so. it would be the best thing for him, if i'm any judge: and if he was
with all of us together he'd be less likely to hav

ll see how the others feel."
     "what's this mouse doing in here?" asked dandelion.
     hazel explained. dandelion was as puzzled as bigwig had been.
     "well, i'll admit i hadn't any particular idea when i went out to help it," said
hazel. "i have now, though, and i'll explain later what it is. but, first of all, bigwig
and i ought to go and talk to holly. and, dandelion, you go and tell the rest what
you told me, will you, and see what they want to do tonight?"
     they found holly with bluebell and pipkin, on the turf by the anthill where
dandelion had first looked over the down. holly was sniffing at a purple orchis.
the head of mauve blooms rocked gently on its stem as he pushed his nose
against it.
     "don't frighten it, master," said bluebell. "it might fly away. after all, it's got a
lot of spots to choose from. look at them all over the leaves."
     "oh, get along with you, bluebell," answered holly, good-humoredly. "we
need to learn about the ground here. half the plants are

other rabbits are wondering whether i might want to alter things, will you let
them know that i shan't?"
     "yes, i will," said silver.
     bigwig came up. "i know it's not owl time yet," he said, "but everyone's so

eager to hear you, holly, that they want to go underground at once. will that suit
you?"
     "underground?" replied holly. "but how can you all hear me underground? i
was expecting to talk here."
     "come and see," said bigwig.
     holly and bluebell were impressed by the honeycomb.
     "this is something quite new," said holly. "what keeps the roof up?"
     "it doesn't need to be kept up," said bluebell. "it's right up the hill already."
     "an idea we found on the way," said bigwig.
     "lying in a field," said bluebell. "it's all right, master, i'll be quiet while you're
speaking."
     "yes, you must," said holly. "soon no one will want jokes."
     almost all the rabbits had followed them down. the honeycomb, though big

scream -- and one of the men went over and picked him up and hit him. i really
believe he may not have suffered very much, because the bad air had turned him
silly: but i wish i hadn't seen it. after that, the man stopped up the hole that
scabious had come out of.
     "by this time the poisoned air must have been spreading through the runs and
burrows underground. i can imagine what it must have been like--"
     "you can't," said bluebell. holly stopped and after a pause bluebell went on.
     "i heard the commotion beginning before i smelled the stuff myself. the does
seemed to get it first and some of them began trying to get out. but the ones who
had litters wouldn't leave the kittens and they were attacking any rabbit who
came near them. they wanted to fight -- to protect the kittens, you know. very

pushed great masses of earth in front of it until the field was destroyed. the
whole place became like a cattle wade in winter and you could no longer tell
where any part of the field had been, between the wood and the brook. earth and
roots and grass and bushes it pushed before it and -- and other things as well,
from underground.
     "after a long time i went back through the wood. i'd forgotten any idea of
collecting other rabbits, but there were three who joined me all the same --
bluebell here and pimpernel and young toadflax. toadflax was the only member
of the owsla i'd seen and i asked him about the threarah, but he couldn't talk any

kind of sense. i never found out what happened to the threarah. i hope he died
quickly.
     "pimpernel was light-headed -- chattering nonsense -- and bluebell and i
weren't much better. for some reason all i could think of was bigwig. i
remembed how i'd gone to arrest him -- to kill him, really -- and i felt i had to

been wrong: and this idea was all the sense i had left.
the four of us went wandering away and we must have gone almost in a half-
circle, because after a long time we came to the brook, below what had been our
field. we followed it down into a big wood; and that night, while we were still in
the wood, toadflax died. he was clear-headed for a short time before and i
remember something he said. bluebell had been saying that he knew the men
hated us for raiding their crops and gardens, and toadflax answered, 'that wasn't
why they destroyed the warren. it was just because we were in their way. they
killed us to suit themselves.' soon after that he went to sleep, and a little later,
when we were alarmed by some noise or other, we tried to wake him and realized
he was dead.
     "we left him lying where he was and went on until we reached the river. i

suppose you must have had it easier, before all the rain.
     "i didn't like the fields on the other side of the river. there was a man with a
gun who kept walking everywhere. i took the other two on, across a road, and
soon we came to a bad place -- all heather and soft black earth. we had a hard
time there, but again i came upon hraka about three days old and no sign of holes
or rabbits, so i thought there was a chance that they were yours. bluebell was all
right, but pimpernel was feverish and i was afraid he was going to die, too.
     "then we had a bit of luck -- or so we thought at the time. that night we fell in
with a hlessi on the edge of the heather -- an old, tough rabbit with his nose all
scratched and scarred -- and he told us that there was a warren not far off and
showed us which way to go. we came to woods and fields again, but we were so
much exhausted that we couldn't start looking for the warren. we crept into a
ditch and

 i hadn't the heart to tell one of the others to keep awake. i tried to keep
awake myself, but i couldn't."
     "when was this?" asked hazel.
     "the day before yesterday," said holly, "early in the morning. when i woke it
was still some time before ni-frith. everything was quiet and all i could smell was
rabbit, but i felt at once that something was wrong. i woke bluebell and i was just
going to wake pimpernel when i realized that there was a whole bunch of rabbits
all round us. they were great, big fellows and they had a very odd smell. it was
like -- well, like--"
     "we know what it was like," said fiver.
     "i thought you probably did. then one of them said, 'my name's cowslip. who

couldn't see that they had any reason to wish us harm, so i told him that we'd had

 come a long way and that we were looking for some rabbits from
our warren -- hazel, fiver and bigwig. as soon as i said those names this rabbit
turned to the others and cried, 'i knew it! tear them to pieces!' and they all set on
us. one of them got me by the ear and ripped it up before bluebell could pull him
off. we were fighting the lot of them. i was so much taken by surprise that i
couldn't do a great deal at first. but the funny thing was that although they were
so big and yelling for our blood, they couldn't fight at all: they obviously didn't
know the first thing about fighting. bluebell knocked down a couple twice his
size, and although my ear was pouring with blood i was never really in danger. all
the same, they were too many for us, and we had to run. bluebell and i had jus

'hurry up, then,' i said, with my back legs braced in his stomach. 'they've gone to
the hills,' he panted. 'the high hills you can see away over there. they went
yesterday morning.' i pretended not to believe him and acted as though i was
going to kill him. but he didn't alter his story, so i scratched him and let him go
and away we came. it was clear weather and we could see the hills plainly enough.
     "after that we had the worst time of all. if it hadn't been for bluebell's jokes
and chatter we'd have stopped running for certain."
     "hraka one end, jokes the other," said bluebell. "i used to roll a joke along the
ground and we both followed it. that was how we kept going."
     "i can't really tell you much about the rest of it," said holly. "my ear was
terribly painful and all the time i kept thinking that pimpernel's death was my
fault. if i hadn't gone to sleep he wouldn't have died. once we tried to sleep again,
but my dreams were more than i could bear.

the open and i know i was really hoping that the elil would come and make an
end of me. but when i came to my senses, there was bigwig. my first thought was
that i must be dead, but then i began to wonder whether he was real or not. well,
you know the rest. it's a pity i frightened you so much. but if i wasn't the -- the
black rabbit, there's hardly a living creature that can ever have been closer to
him than we have."
     after a silence, he added, "you can imagine what it means to bluebell and me
to find ourselves underground, among friends. it wasn't i who tried to arrest you,
bigwig -- that was another rabbit, long, long ago."

it is, rather, a blessedly circumscribed imagination and an intuitive feeling that
life is now. a foraging wild creature, intent above all upon survival, is as strong
as the grass. collectively, rabbits rest secure upon frith's promise to el-ahrairah.
hardly a full day had elapsed since holly had come crawling in delirium to the
foot of watership down. yet already he was near recovery, while the more light-
hearted bluebell seemed even less the worse for the dreadful catastrophe that he
had survived. hazel and his companions had suffered extremes of grief and
horror during the telling of holly's tale. pipkin had cried and trembled piteously
at the death of scabious, and acorn and speedwell had been seized with
convulsive choking as bluebell told of the poisonous gas that murdered
underground. yet, as with primitive humans, the very strength and vividness of
their sympathy brought with it a true release. their feel

 his ear was in ribbons and there was
any amount of dirt in it. hazel felt annoyed with dandelion. as several of the
rabbits began to silflay, attracted by the mild june night and the full moon, he
asked blackberry to wait. silver, who had been about to leave by the other run,
returned and joined them.
     "dandelion and the other two seem to have cheered you up, all right," said
hazel to holly. "it's a pity they didn't clean you up as well. that dirt's dangerous."
     "well, you see--" began bluebell, who had remained beside holly.
     "don't make a joke," said hazel. "you seem to think--"
     "i wasn't going to," said bluebell. "i was only going to say that i wanted to
clean the captain's ear, but it's too tender to be touched."
     "he's quite right," said holly. "i'm afraid i made them neglect it, but do as you
think best, hazel, i'm feeling much better now."
     hazel began on the ear himself. the blood had caked black and the task needed
patience. after a while the long, jagged wou

but surely we're not going to have the warren overrun with mice and -- and stag
beetles, are we?"
     "no, i didn't mean quite that," said hazel. "i'm not suggesting we should go
about looking for field mice and inviting them to join us. they wouldn't thank us
for that, anyway. but that mouse tonight -- we saved his life--"
     "you saved his life," said blackberry.
     "well, his life was saved. he'll remember that."
     "but how's it going to help us?" asked bluebell.
     "to start with, he can tell us what he knows about the place--"
     "what mice know. not what rabbits need to know."
     "well, i admit a mouse might or might not come in handy," said hazel. "but
i'm sure a bird would, if we could only do enough for it. we can't fly, but some of

too. all i'm saying is this. if anyone finds an animal or bird, that isn't an enemy,

     "i think it's a good idea, but real opportunities of the kind hazel has in mind
aren't likely to come very often."
     "i think that's about right," said holly, wincing as silver resumed licking. "the
idea's all right as far as it goes, but it won't come to a great deal in practice."
     "i'm ready to give it a try," said silver. "i reckon it'll be worth it, just to see
bigwig telling bedtime stories to a mole."
     "el-ahrairah did it once," said bluebell, "and it worked. do you remember?"
     "no," said hazel, "i don't know that story. let's have it."
     "let's silflay first," said holly. "this ear's had all i can stand for the time
being."
     "well, at least it's clean now," said hazel. "but i'm afraid it'll never be as good
as the other, you know. you'll have a ragged ear."
     "never mind," said holly. "i'm still one of the lucky ones."
     the full moon, well risen in a cloudless eastern sky, covered the high solitude
with its light.

"you're a clever chap, hazel," said holly at last "you and your mouse. mind
you, we'd have found the place ourselves sooner or later, but not as soon as this."
     hazel could have pressed his chin glands for satisfaction, but he replied
merely, "we shan't need to go down the hill so much, after all." then he added,
"but, holly, you smell of blood, you know. it may be dangerous, even here. let's
go back to the wood. it's such a beautiful night that we can sit near the holes to
chew pellets and bluebell can tell us his story."
     they found strawberry and buckthorn on the bank; and when everyone was
comfortably chewing, with ears laid flat, bluebell began.

     "dandelion was telling me last night about cowslip's warren and how he told
the story of the king's lettuce. that's what put me in mind of this tale, even

companion. he would not hear of the gull going out to forage. before ni-frith the
rabbits had managed to produce as much as it could eat -- for a time, at all events
-- and were able to sleep through the heat of the day. bigwig, however, remained
with the gull, making no secret of his admiration, talking and listening to it for
several hours. at the evening feed he joined hazel and holly near the bank where
bluebell had told his story of el-ahrairah.
     "how's the bird now?" asked hazel.
     "a good deal better, i think," replied bigwig. "he's very tough, you know. my
goodness, what a life he's had! you don't know what you're missing! i could sit
and listen to him all day."
     "how was it hurt?"
     "a cat jumped on him in a farmyard. he never heard it until the last moment.

     "how can i tell?" replied fiver. but later, when they were underground, silent
and drowsy, he said suddenly, "the gifts of el-ahrairah. trickery; great danger;

unaware that he had spoken and could add nothing more.
     bigwig spent most of the hours of daylight watching for kehaar's return. he
was inclined to be surly and short, and once, when bluebell remarked that he
thought meester pigvig's fur cap was molting in sympathy for absent friends, he
showed a flash of his old sergeant-major spirit and cuffed and abused him twice
round the honeycomb, until holly intervened to save his faithful jester from
further trouble.
     it was late one afternoon, with a light north wind blowing and the smell of hay
drifting up from the fields of sydmonton, when bigwig came hurtling down into
the honeycomb to announce that kehaar was back. hazel suppressed

t to select his
companions was less easy. everyone was ready to go, but the business was so
important that at last they considered each rabbit in turn, discussing who would
be the most likely to survive the long journey, to arrive in good shape and to go
down well in a strange warren. bigwig, rejected on the grounds that he might
quarrel in strange company, was inclined to be sulky at first, but came round
when he remembered that he could go on looking after kehaar. holly himself
wanted to take bluebell but, as blackberry said, one funny joke at the expense of
the chief rabbit might ruin everything. finally they chose silver, buckthorn and
strawberry. strawberry said little, but was obviously very much pleased. he had
suffered a good deal to show that he was no coward and now he had the

satisfaction of knowing that he was worth something to his new friends.

     should he go alone? it would be safer and more pleasant to take a companion;
but not more than one. they must not attract attention. who would be best?
bigwig? dandelion? hazel rejected them. he needed someone who would do as
he was told and not start having ideas of his own. at once he thought of pipkin.
pipkin would follow him without question and do anything he asked. at this
moment he was probably asleep in the burrow which he shared with bluebell and
acorn, down a short run leading off the honeycomb.
     hazel was lucky. he found pipkin close to the mouth of the burrow and already
awake. he brought him out without disturbing the other two rabbits and led him
up by the run that gave on the bank. pipkin looked about him uncertainly,
bewildered and half expecting some danger.
     "it's all right, hlao-roo," said hazel. "there's nothing to be afraid of. i want
you to come down the hill and help me to find a farm i've heard about. we're ju

confidence, felt sure that he would either smell or hear any hunter on four feet.
     wherever the farm might be, it must lie beyond the road that ran along the
opposite edge of the field. he set off at an easy pace, with pipkin close behind.

h was followed by an extraordinary story that left everyone mystified but
fascinated, about a time when frith had to go away on a journey, leaving the
whole world to be covered with rain. but a man built a great floating hutch that
held all the animals and birds until frith returned and let them out.
     "it won't happen tonight, will it, hazel-rah?" asked pipkin, listening to the rain
in the beech leaves outside. "there's no hutch here."
     "kehaar'll fly you up to the moon, hlao-roo," said bluebell, "and you can come
down on bigwig's head like a birch branch in the frost. but there's time to go to
sleep first."
     before fiver slept, however, he talked again to hazel about the raid.
     "i suppose it's no good asking you not to go?" he said.
     "look here," answered hazel, "have you got one of your bad turns about the
farm? if you have, why not say so straight out? then we'd all know where we
were."
     "i've no feelings about the farm one way or the other," said fiver. "but that

     "but we're not going there to eat, kehaar," said bigwig. "that makes all the
difference. we shan't stop watching for cats the whole time."
     "why not eat the cat?" said bluebell. "or bring one back here for breeding?
that ought to improve the warren stock no end."
     hazel and bigwig had decided that the raid should be carried out as soon after
dark as the farm was quiet. this meant that they would cover the half mile to the
outlying sheds at sunset, instead of risking the confusion of a night journey over
ground that only hazel knew. they could steal a meal among the swedes, halt till
darkness and cover the short distance to the farm after a good rest. then --

     when they came to set out, fiver was nowhere to be seen. hazel felt relieved,
for he had been afraid that fiver might say something that would lower their

spirits. but there was nothing worse to contend with than pipkin's
disappointment at being left behind; and this was dispelled when hazel assured
him that the only reason was that he had already done his bit. bluebell, acorn and
pipkin came with them to the foot of the hill and watched them down the
hedgerow.
     they reached the sheds in the twilight after sunset the summer nightfall was
unbroken by owls and so quiet that they could plainly hear the intermittent,
monotonous "chug chug chug" of a nightingale in the distant woods. two rats
among the swedes showed their teeth, thought better of it and left them alone.
when they had foraged, they rested comfortably in the straw until the western

rabbit who had vanished in the half-light. then, as blackberry said nothing more,
he asked, "do you know what happened?"
     when blackberry had told his news, fiver returned to the warren and went
underground to his empty burrow. a little later bigwig brought the hutch rabbits
up the hill and at once called everyone to meet in the honeycomb. fiver did not
appear.
     it was a dismal welcome for the strangers. not even bluebell could find a
cheerful word. dandelion was inconsolable to think that he might have stopped
hazel breaking from the ditch. the meeting came to an end in a dreary silence
and a half-hearted silflay.
     later that morning holly came limping into the warren. of his three
companions, only silver was alert and unharmed. buckthorn was wounded in the
face and strawberry was shivering and evidently ill from exhaustion. there were
no other rabbits with them.

     "they missed you on the way in, then?" said bluebell.
     "oh, no, they didn't! we learned later that some time after we'd been brought
in by this rabbit -- captain campion -- a runner arrived from a wide patrol to say
that they'd picked up the track of three or four rabbits coming toward efrafa from
the north, and were there any orders? he was sent back to say that we were safely
under control.
     "anyway, this captain campion took us down to a hole in the ditch. the mouth
of the hole was a bit of old earthenware pipe and if a man had pulled

     "where have you been?" asked bigwig. "and where's fiver? wasn't he with
you?"
     "fiver's with hazel," said blackberry. "hazel's alive. he's been wounded -- it's
hard to tell how badly -- but he won't die."
     the other three rabbits looked at him speechlessly. blackberry waited,
enjoying the effect.
     "hazel's alive?" said bigwig. "are you sure?"
     "quite sure," said blackberry. "he's at the foot of the hill at this very moment,
in that ditch where you were the night holly and bluebell arrived."
     "i can hardly believe it," said holly. "if it's true, it's the best news i've ever
heard in my life. blackberry, you really are sure? what happened? tell us."
     "fiver found him," said blackberry. "fiver took me with him, nearly all the way
back to the farm: then he went along the ditch and found hazel gone to ground

     "there should have been more, hazel," said bigwig. "we shall all be at each
other's throats, you know -- i don't see how it's to be helped."
     late in the afternoon hazel called everyone into the honeycomb.
     "i've been thinking things over," he said. "i know you must all have been really
disappointed not to have got rid of me at nuthanger farm the other day, so i've
decided to go a bit further next time."
     "where?" asked bluebell.
     "to efrafa," replied hazel, "if i can get anyone to come with me: and we shall
bring back as many does as the warren needs."
     there were murmurs of astonishment, and then speedwell asked, "how?"
     "blackberry and i have got a plan," said hazel, "but i'm not going to explain it
now, for this reason. you all know that this is going to be a dangerous business. if
any of you get caught and taken into efrafa, they'll make you talk, all right. but

     "blackberry!" said hazel. "why, i thought you'd been here all the time. where
have you been?"
     "sorry not to have come before," said blackberry. i've been talking to kehaar,
as a matter of fact, about the plan. he's improved it a good deal. if i'm not
mistaken, general woundwort's going to look remarkably silly before we've
finished. i thought at first that it couldn't be done, but now i feel sure it can."
     "come where the grass is greener," said bluebell,
     "and the lettuces grow in rows,
     "and a rabbit of free demeanor
     "is known by his well-scratched nose.
     "i think i shall have to come, just to satisfy my curiosity. i've been opening and
shutting my mouth like a baby bird to know about this plan and no one puts
anything in. i suppose bigwig's going to dress up as a hrududu and drive all the
does across the field."
     hazel turned on him sharply. bluebell sat up on his hind legs and said, "please,

was only trying to cheer everyone up a bit. after all, most of us feel frightened at
the idea of going to this place and you can't blame us, can you? it sounds horribly
dangerous."
     "well, look here," said hazel, "we'll finish this meeting now. let's wait and see
what we decide -- that's the rabbits' way. no one has to go to efrafa who doesn't
want to, but it's clear enough that some of us mean to go. now i'm off to talk to

     with the exception of buckthorn and the addition of bluebell, the rabbits who
set off from the southern end of the beech hanger early the next morning were
those who had left sandleford with hazel five weeks before. hazel had said
nothing more to persuade them, feeling that it would be better simply to leave
things to set in his favor. he knew that they were afraid, for he was afraid himself.
indeed, he guessed that they, like himself, could not be free from the thought of
efrafa and its grim owsla. but working against this fear was their longing and

oup had come up while hazel had been gazing at the belt, and now
all the rabbits were either nibbling quietly or resting, with ears laid flat, in the
light green sun-and-shade of the thorn thicket
     "is bigwig there?" asked hazel.
     throughout the morning bigwig had seemed unlike himself -- silent and
preoccupied, with little attention for what was going on around him. if his
courage had not been beyond question, it might have been thought that he was
feeling nervous. during one long halt bluebell had overheard him talking with
hazel, fiver and blackberry, and later had told pipkin that it sounded for all the
world as though bigwig were being reassured. "fighting, yes, anywhere," he had
heard him say, "but i still reckon that this game is more in someone else's line
than mine." "no," replied hazel, "you're the only one that can do it: and
remember, this isn't sport, if the farm raid was. everything depends on it." then,
realizing that bluebell could hear him, he added, "anyway, keep on t

     "o frith and inlé!" cried blackberry, stamping. pipkin turned to bolt. hazel did
not move.
     "shall we go, hazel?" asked silver. "we can't help him now."
     as he spoke, bigwig suddenly broke out of the trees, running very fast. almost
before they could grasp that he was alive, he had recrossed the entire upper slope
of the combe in a single dash and bolted in among them.
     "come on," said bigwig, "let's get out of here!"
     "but what -- what -- are you wounded?" asked bluebell in bewilderment.
     "no," said bigwig, "never better! let's go!"
     "you can wait until i'm ready," said hazel in a cold, angry tone. "you've done
your best to kill yourself and acted like a complete fool. now hold your tongue
and sit down!" he turned and, although it was rapidly becoming too dark to see
any distance, made as though he were still looking out across the combe. behind
him, the rabbits fidgeted nervously. several had begun to feel a dreamlike sense
of unreality. the long day a

for signs of an efrafan patrol, they saw nothing but mice, and a few hedgehogs
hunting for slugs along the ditches.
     at last, as the first lark rose toward the light that was still far up in the sky,
silver, his pale fur sodden dark with dew, came limping back to where hazel was
encouraging bluebell and pipkin.
     "you can pluck up your spirits, bluebell," he said. "i think we're close to the
iron road."

     "i wouldn't care about my spirits," said bluebell, "if my legs weren't so tired.
slugs are lucky not to have legs. i think i'll be a slug."
     "well, i'm a hedgehog," said hazel, "so you'd better get on!"
     "you're not," replied bluebell. "you haven't enough fleas. now, slugs don't
have fleas, either. how comforting to be a slug, among the dandelions so snug--"

     "what is it, kehaar? not a patrol?"
     "na, na. ees all fine for sleep like bloody owls. maybe i go for peeg vater.

     "no, you're right, kehaar, we must start now. the trouble is, i can see how to
start but not how to finish."
     hazel made his way through the grass, roused the first rabbit he found -- who
happened to be bluebell -- and sent him to fetch bigwig, blackberry and fiver.
when they came, he took them to join kehaar on the short grass of the riverbank.
     "this is the problem, blackberry," he said. "you remember that when we were
under the down that evening i said we should have to do three things: get the
does out of efrafa, break up the pursuit and then get right away so that they
wouldn't find us. this plan you've thought up is clever. it'll do the first two things,
all right, i'm sure of that. but what

p a pursuit while we're getting the does
out, but they'll know which way we've gone and they won't leave it at that. no,
you're right, we've got to vanish without a trace, so that they can't even track us.
but how?"
     "i don't know," said blackberry again. "shall we go up the river a little way and
have a look at it? perhaps there's somewhere we could use for a hiding place. can
you manage that, with your leg?"
     "if we don't go too far," replied hazel.
     "can i come, hazel-rah?" asked bluebell, who had been waiting about, a little
way off.
     "yes, all right," said hazel good-naturedly, as he began to limp along the bank
upstream.
     they soon realized that the woodland on this left bank was lonely, thick and
overgrown -- denser than the nut copses and bluebell woods of sandleford.
several times they heard the drumming of a great woodpecker, the shyest of
birds. as blackberry was suggesting that perhaps they might look for a hiding
place somewhere in this jungle, they became awar

 the pool and perched on the hand rail.
     "this is more sheltered and lonely than the bridge we crossed last night," said
blackberry. "perhaps we could make some use of it. you didn't know about this
bridge, kehaar, did you?"
     "na, not know, not see heem. but ees goot pridge -- no von come."

     "i'd like to go across, hazel-rah," said blackberry.
     "well, fiver's the rabbit for that," replied hazel. "he simply loves crossing
bridges. you carry on. i'll come behind, with bigwig and bluebell here."
     the five rabbits hopped slowly along the planks, their great, sensitive ears full
of the sound of the falling water. hazel, who was not sure of his footing, had to
stop several times. when at length he reached the further side, he found that
fiver and blackberry had already gone a little way downstream below the fall and
were looking at some large object sticking out from the bank. at first he thought
that it must be a fallen tree trunk, but as he came closer he saw that, although i

you could gnaw it through and the leaf -- the boat -- would drop off the bank."
     "well, anyway, let's go back now," said hazel, rather dejectedly. "i'm afraid we
don't seem to be any nearer to finding what we're looking for, kehaar. can you
possibly wait until tomorrow? i had the idea that we might all move to
somewhere a bit drier before tonight -- higher up in the wood, away from the
river."
     "oh, what a pity!" said bluebell. "do you know, i'd quite decided to become a
water rabbit."
     "a what?" asked bigwig.
     "a water rabbit," repeated bluebell. "well, there are water rats and water
beetles and pipkin says that last night he saw a water hawk. so why not a water
rabbit? i shall float merrily along--"
     "great golden frith on a hill!" cried blackberry suddenly. "great jumping
rabscuttle! that's it! that's it! bluebell, you shall be a water rabbit!" he began
leaping and skipping about on the bank and cuffin

is. frith knows what may have happened already."
     as they set off up the left bank, the wind began to blow in fitful, warm gusts,
with a multifoliate rustling through the sedges. they had just reached the plank
bridge when there came a rumble of thunder. in the intense, strange light, the
plants and leaves seemed magnified and the fields beyond the river very near.
there was an oppressive stillness.
     "you know, hazel-rah," said bluebell, "this really is the funniest evening i've

ever gone looking for a doe."
     "it's going to get a lot funnier soon," said silver. "there'll be lightning and
pouring rain. for goodness' sake, all of you, don't panic, or we'll never see our
warren again. i think this is going to be a rough business," he added quietly to
hazel. "i don't like it much."

     bigwig woke to hear his name repeated urgently.

 clearly frightened, but determined not to run; dandelion
encouraging pipkin; speedwell and hawkbit making toward kehaar -- the only
creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made them understand that they were to help to get the
does away.
     "go back to blackberry, go back to blackberry," silver kept repeating. "i left
three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then bluebell, then fiver -- he's quite near the river."
     "and there is blackberry," said bigwig.
     "you did it, then, bigwig," said blackberry, shivering. "was it very bad? good
heavens, your shoulder--"
     "it's not finished yet," said bigwig. "has everyone passed you?"
     "you're the last," said blackberry. "can we go? this storm's terrifying me!"

     "they'll never give up," said bigwig. "i warn you, silver, they'll be at us before
it's done. there's thick cover in the water meadow -- they'll use that. acorn, come
back, keep away from that ditch!"
     "go back to bluebell! go back to bluebell!" repeated silver, running from side
to side.
     they found bluebell by the hedge at the bottom of the field. he was white-eyed
and ready to bolt.
     "silver," he said, "i saw a bunch of rabbits -- strangers, efrafans, i suppose --
come out of the ditch over there and slip across into the water meadow. they're
behind us now. one of them was the biggest rabbit i've ever seen."
     "then don't stay here," said silver. "there goes speedwell. and who's that?

icks, the pain in his leg, the damp, chuckling tunnel at his very
ear -- he had known them all before. how could the men not see him? they must
see him. he was lying at their feet. he was wounded. they were coming to pick
him up.
     then the sounds and smells were receding into the distance, the thudding of
the footsteps diminished. the men had crossed the bridge without looking over
the parapet. they were gone.
     hazel came to. "that settles it," he said. "everyone's got to swim. come on,
bluebell, you say you're a water rabbit. follow me." he got on the thwart and
went along it to the side.
     but it was pipkin that he found next to him.
     "quick, hazel-rah," said pipkin, twitching and trembling. "i'll come, too. only
be quick."
     hazel shut his eyes and fell over the side into the water.
     as in the enborne, there was an instant shock of cold. but more than this, and
at once, he felt the pull of the current. he was being drawn away by a force like a
high wind, yet smooth and

   in spite of what blackavar had said, it was a long time before everyone had left
the boat. there were in fact ten does altogether -- though none of the rabbits
knew the number -- and although one or two responded to bigwig's patient
urging, several were so much exhausted that they remained huddled where they
were, or looked stupidly at the water until others were brought to take their place.
from time to time bigwig would ask one of the bucks to give a lead and in this
way acorn, hawkbit and bluebell all scrambled over the side. the injured doe,
thrayonlosa, was clearly in a bad way and blackberry and thethuthinnang swam
through together, one in front of her and one behind.
     as darkness closed in, the rain stopped. hazel and blackavar went back to the
bank of the pool below the bridge. the sky cleared and the oppression lifted as
the thunder moved away eastward. but it was fu inlé before bigwig himself came
through the bridge with silver and fiver. it was as much as ever he could do to

kavar entertained a tremendous respect -- to see that he did
not overreach himself in his warm-hearted, rather candid zeal.
     after two or three days of slow, careful journeying, with many halts in cover,
they found themselves, late one afternoon, once more in sight of caesar's belt,
but further west than before, close to a little copse at the top of some rising
ground. everyone was tired and when they had fed -- "evening silflay every day,
just as you promised," said hyzenthlay to bigwig -- bluebell and speedwell
suggested that it might be worthwhile to dig some scrapes in the light soil under
the trees and live there for a day or two. hazel felt willing enough, but fiver
needed persuasion.
     "i know we can do with a rest, but somehow i don't altogether like it, hazel-
rah," he said. "i suppose i've got to try to think why?"
     "not on my account," answered hazel. "but i doubt you'll shift the others this
time. one or two of these does are 'ready for mudder,' as kehaar would say, and

 
 ___________________________
 
that's the real reason why bluebell and the rest are prepared to be at the trouble
of digging scrapes. surely it'll be all right at that rate, won't it? you know what
they say -- 'rabbit underground, rabbit safe and sound.'"
     "well, you may be right," said fiver. "that vilthuril's a beautiful doe. i'd like a
chance to get to know her better. after all, it's not natural to rabbits, is it? -- on
and on day after day."
     later, however, when blackavar returned with dandelion from a patrol they
had undertaken on their own init

ound. as hazel had
foreseen, there was some mating and a scuffle or two, but no one was hurt. by the
evening a kind of holiday spirit prevailed. hazel's leg was stronger and bigwig felt
fitter than at any time since he went into efrafa. the does, harassed and bony two
days before, were beginning to look quite sleek.
     on the second morning, silflay did not begin until some time after dawn. a
light wind was blowing straight into the north bank of the copse, where the
scrapes had been dug, and bluebell, when he came up, swore he could smell
rabbits on it.
     "it's old holly pressing his chin glands for us, hazel-rah," he said. "a rabbit's
sneeze on the morning breeze sets homesick hearts aglow--"
     "sitting with his rump in a chicory clump and longing for a nice plump doe,"
replied hazel.

     "that won't do, hazel-rah," said bluebell. "he's got two does up there."
     "only hutch does," replied hazel. "i dare say they're fairly tough and fast by
now, but all the same they'll never be

, they wander about quite happily. look at
those two, right away under the bank there. they feel they can -- oh, great frith!"
     as he spoke a tawny shape, dog-like, sprang out of the overhanging nut bushes
as silently as light from behind a cloud. it landed between the two does, grabbed
one by the neck and dragged her up the bank in a flash. the wind veered and the
reek of fox came over the grass. with stamping and flashing of tails every rabbit
on the slope dashed for cover.
     hazel and bluebell found themselves crouched with blackavar. the efrafan
was matter-of-fact and detached.
     "poor little beast," he said. "you see, their instincts are weakened by life in the
mark. fancy feeding under bushes on the windward side of a wood! never mind,
hazel-rah, these things happen. but look, i tell you what. unless there are two

and traveled

over a mile to the outskirts of kingsclere, returning with a tale of mischief and
feasting in a cottage garden. blackavar's hearing had weakened since the
mutilation of his ears; but holly found that his power of noticing and drawing
conclusions from anything unusual was almost uncanny and that he seemed to be
able to become invisible at will.
     sixteen bucks and ten does made a happy enough society for a warren. there
was some bickering here and there, but nothing serious. as bluebell said, any
rabbits who felt discontented could always go back to efrafa; and the thought of
all that they had faced together was enough to take the sting out of anything that
might have made a real quarrel. the contentment of the does spread to everyone
else, until one evening hazel remarked that he felt a perfect fraud as chief rabbit,
for there were no problems and hardly a dispute to be settled.
     "have you thought about the winter yet?" asked holly.
     four or five of the bucks, with cl

e cold weather comes. i think we ought to be able to get below
the frost. as for the wind, we can block some of the holes and sleep warm. grass
is poor in winter, i know; but anyone who wants a change can always go out with
holly here and try his luck at pinching some greenstuff or cattle roots. it's a time
of year to be careful of the elil, though. myself, i shall be quite happy to sleep
underground, play bob-stones and hear a few stories from time to time."
     "what about a story now?" said bluebell. "come on, dandelion. 'how i nearly
missed the boat.' what about that?"
     "oh, you mean 'woundwort dismayed,'" said dandelion. "that's bigwig's story
-- i wouldn't presume to tell it. but it makes a change to be thinking about winter
on an evening like this. it reminds me of a story i've listened to but never tried to
tell myself. so some of you may know it and perhaps some won't. it's the story of
rowsby woof and the fairy wogdog."
     "off you go," said fiver, "and lay it on thick."

     "can't," panted bigwig. "you couldn't get past me here -- no room -- and if i go
back that brute'll follow -- next thing you'd know he'd be loose in the burrows.
you leave it to me. i know what i'm doing."
     it had occurred to bigwig that in the narrow run even his dead body would be a
considerable obstacle. the efrafans would either have to get it out or dig round it
and this would mean more delay. in the burrow behind him he could hear
bluebell, who was apparently telling the does a story. "good idea," he thought.
"keep 'em happy. more than i could do if i had to sit there."
     "so then el-ahrairah said to the fox, 'fox you may smell and fox you may be,
but i can tell your fortune in the water.'"
     suddenly woundwort spoke.
     "thlayli," he said, "why do you want to throw your life away? i can send one
fresh rabbit after another into this run if i choose. you're too good to be killed.

, and scarcely restored to his senses sufficiently to
grasp what was toward. at length, however, after the five efrafans had remained
crouching for some time in the burrow, listening to the sounds of the dog hunting
above, fiver recovered himself, made his way to the mouth of the run where
bigwig still lay half conscious, and succeeded in making holly and silver
understand that the siege was ended. there was no lack of helpers to tear open
the blocked gaps in the south wall. it so happened that bluebell was the first
through into the honeycomb; and for many days afterward he was still improving
upon his imitation of captain fiver at the head of his crowd of efrafan prisoners
-- "like a tomtit rounding up a bunch of molting jackdaws," as he put it.

     no one was inclined to pay them much attention at the time, however, for the
only thoughts throughout the warren were for hazel and bigwig. bigwig seemed
likely to die. bleeding in half a dozen places, he lay with closed eyes in the run he

to join the warren and after a shaky start, when they were regarded with dislike
and suspicion, were settling down pretty well, largely because hazel was
determined that they should.
     since the night of the siege, fiver had spent much time alone and even in the
honeycomb, or at morning and evening silflay, was often silent and preoccupied.
no one resented this -- "he looks right through you in such a nice, friendly way,"
as bluebell put it -- for each in his own manner recognized that fiver was now
more than ever governed, whether he would or no, by the pulse of that mysterious
world of which he had once spoken to hazel during the late june days they had
spent together at the foot of the down. it was bigwig who said -- one evening
when fiver was absent from the honeycomb at story time -- that fiver was one
who had paid more dearly than even himself for the night's victory over the
efrafans. yet to his doe, vilthuril, fiver

came. that was what i was going to say just now, but it was as well i didn't, i
suppose."
     "i wonder how they're getting on with that winter burrow down the hill," said
hazel. "we're going to need it when the hard weather comes. that hole in the roof
of the honeycomb doesn't help at all. it'll close up naturally one day, i suppose,
but meanwhile it's a confounded nuisance."
     "here come the burrow-diggers, anyway," said silver.
     pipkin and bluebell came over the crest, together with three or four of the
does.
     "ah ha, ah ha, o hazel-rah," said bluebell. "the burrow's snug, it hath been
dug, t'is free from beetle, worm and slug. and in the snow, when down we go--"
     "then what a lot to you we'll owe," said hazel. "i mean it, too. the holes are
concealed, are they?"
     "just like efrafa, i should think," said bluebell. "as a matter of fact, i brought
one up with me to show you. you can't see it, can you? no -- well, there you are.

the evening side of the wood with us, hazel-rah?" said pipkin.
"we came up early on purpose to have a bit of sunshine before it gets dark."
     "all right," answered hazel good-naturedly. "we've just come back from there,
silver and i, but i don't mind slipping over again for a bit."
     "let's go out to that little hollow where we found kehaar that morning," said
silver. "it'll be out of the wind. d'you remember how he cursed at us and tried to
peck us?"
     "and the worms we carried?" said bluebell. "don't forget them."
     as they came near the hollow they could hear that it was not empty. evidently
some of the other rabbits had had the same idea.
     "let's see how close we can get before they spot us," said silver. "real campion
style -- come on."
     they approached very quietly, upwind from the north. peeping over the edge,
they saw vilthuril and her litter of four lying in the sun. their mother was telling
the young rabbits a story.
     "so after they had swum the river," said v

nto the ground to find where the spell was buried. deep
he dug, and hard was the search, but at last he found that wicked spell and
dragged it out. so they all fled from it, but it turned into a great rat and flew at el-
ahrairah. then el-ahrairah fought the rat, up and down, and at last he held it,
pinned under his claws, and it turned into a great white bird which spoke to him
and blessed him."
     "i seem to know this story," whispered hazel, "but i can't remember where i've
heard it."
     bluebell sat up and scratched his neck with his hind leg. the little rabbits
turned round at the interruption and in a moment had tumbled up the side of the
hollow, squeaking "hazel-rah! hazel-rah!" and jumping on hazel from all sides.
     "here, wait a minute," said hazel, cuffing them off. "i didn't come here to get
mixed up in a fight with a lot of roughs like you! let's hear the rest of the story."
     "but there's a man coming on a horse, hazel-rah," said one of the young
rabbits. "oughtn't we to
