cancel one another out, leaving a pattern of
unscathed positions on the target—positions that are hit when only one slit in the barrier is open.

such  experiments  show  that  einstein's  particles  of  light  are  quite  different  from  newton's.
somehow photons—although they are particles—embody wave-like features of light as well. the fact
that the energy of these particles is determined by a wave-like feature—frequency—is the first clue
that a strange union is occurring. but the photoelectric effect and the double-slit experiment really
bring the lesson home. the photoelectric effect shows that light has particle properties. the double-
slit experiment shows that light manifests the interference properties of waves. together they show
that light has both wave-like and particle-like properties. the microscopic world demands that we
shed our intuition that something is either a wave or a particle and embrace the possibility that it is
both. it is here that feynman's pronouncement that "nobod

phase. when used in reference to matter, describes its possible states: solid phase, liquid phase, gas
phase. more generally, refers to the possible descriptions of a physical system as features on which it
depends (temperature, string coupling constant values, form of spacetime, etc.) are varied.
phase transition. evolution of a physical system from one phase to another.
photoelectric effect. phenomenon in which electrons are ejected from a metallic surface when light
is shone upon it.
photon.  smallest  packet  of 
electromagnetic force; smallest bundle of light.
planck energy. about 1,000 kilowatt hours. the energy necessary to probe to distances as small as
the planck length. the typical energy of a vibrating string in string theory.
planck length. about 10-33 centimeters. the scale below which quantum fluctuations in the fabric of
spacetime would become enormous. the size of a
