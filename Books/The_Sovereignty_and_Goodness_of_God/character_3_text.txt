master's wigwam, i
took the first opportunity i could get to go look after my dead child.
when i came i asked them what they had done with it; then they told me
it was upon the hill. then they went and showed me where it was, where i
saw the ground was newly digged, and there they told me they had buried
it. there i left that child in the wilderness, and must commit it, and
myself also in this wilderness condition, to him who is above all. god
having taken away this dear child, i went to see my daughter mary, who
was at this same indian town, at a wigwam not very far off, though we
had little liberty or opportunity to see one another. she was about
ten years old, and taken from the door at first by a praying ind. and
afterward sold for a gun. when i came in sight, she would fall aweeping;
at which they were provoked, and would not let me come near her, but
bade me be gone; which was a heart-cutting word to me. i had one child
dead, another in the wilderness, i knew not where, the third they

ms, two years old, and bad rivers there were to go over,
and we were feeble, with our poor and coarse entertainment. i had my
bible with me, i pulled it out, and asked her whether she would read. we
opened the bible and lighted on psalm 27, in which psalm we especially
took notice of that, ver. ult., "wait on the lord, be of good courage,
and he shall strengthen thine heart, wait i say on the lord."




the fourth remove

and now i must part with that little company i had. here i parted from
my daughter mary (whom i never saw again till i saw her in dorchester,
returned from captivity), and from four little cousins and neighbors,
some of which i never saw afterward: the lord only knows the end of
them. amongst them also was that poor woman before mentioned, who came
to a sad end, as some of the company told me in my travel: she having
much grief upon her spirit about her miserable condition, being so near
her time, she would be often asking the indians to let her go home; they
not being willin

self had nothing on
but his shirt and waistcoat. this sight was enough to melt a heart of
flint. there they lay quivering in the cold, the youth round like a dog,
the papoose stretched out with his eyes and nose and mouth full of dirt,
and yet alive, and groaning. i advised john to go and get to some fire.
he told me he could not stand, but i persuaded him still, lest he should
lie there and die. and with much ado i got him to a fire, and went
myself home. as soon as i was got home his master's daughter came after
me, to know what i had done with the englishman. i told her i had got
him to a fire in such a place. now had i need to pray paul's prayer
"that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men" (2
thessalonians 3.2). for her satisfaction i went along with her, and
brought her to him; but before i got home again it was noised about that
i was running away and getting the english youth, along with me; that as
soon as i came in they began to rant and domineer, asking me where i had

heir ill doings, for this
indian her master, was hanged afterward at boston. the indians now began
to come from all quarters, against their merry dancing day. among some
of them came one goodwife kettle. i told her my heart was so heavy that
it was ready to break. "so is mine too," said she, but yet said, "i hope
we shall hear some good news shortly." i could hear how earnestly my
sister desired to see me, and i as earnestly desired to see her; and yet
neither of us could get an opportunity. my daughter was also now about a
mile off, and i had not seen her in nine or ten weeks, as i had not seen
my sister since our first taking. i earnestly desired them to let me go
and see them: yea, i entreated, begged, and persuaded them, but to let
me see my daughter; and yet so hard-hearted were they, that they would
not suffer it. they made use of their tyrannical power whilst they
had it; but through the lord's wonderful mercy, their time was now but
short.

major waldron's, and another with him, which was
my sister's son. i asked him how he knew it? he said the major himself
told him so. so along we went till we came to newbury; and their
minister being absent, they desired my husband to preach the
thanksgiving for them; but he was not willing to stay there that night,
but would go over to salisbury, to hear further, and come again in the
morning, which he did, and preached there that day. at night, when
he had done, one came and told him that his daughter was come in at
providence. here was mercy on both hands. now hath god fulfilled that
precious scripture which was such a comfort to me in my distressed
condition. when my heart was ready to sink into the earth (my children
being gone, i could not tell whither) and my knees trembling under me,
and i was walking through the valley of the shadow of death; then the
lord brought, and now has fulfilled that reviving word unto me: "thus
saith the lord, refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes fr

ts were pleased
to pay. the lord reward the major, and all the rest, though unknown
to me, for their labor of love. my sister's son was redeemed for four
pounds, which the council gave order for the payment of. having now
received one of our children, we hastened toward the other. going back
through newbury my husband preached there on the sabbath day; for which
they rewarded him many fold.

on monday we came to charlestown, where we heard that the governor of
rhode island had sent over for our daughter, to take care of her,
being now within his jurisdiction; which should not pass without our
acknowledgments. but she being nearer rehoboth than rhode island, mr.
newman went over, and took care of her and brought her to his own house.
and the goodness of god was admirable to us in our low estate, in that
he raised up passionate friends on every side to us, when we had nothing
to recompense any for their love. the indians were now gone that way,
that it was apprehended dangerous to go to her. but
