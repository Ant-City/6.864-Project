    why followed not, when she said 'tybalt's dead,'
    thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
    which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
    but with a rearward following tybalt's death,
    'romeo is banished'- to speak that word
    is father, mother, tybalt, romeo, juliet,
    all slain, all dead. 'romeo is banished'-

    thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
    taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
    and turn'd that black word death to banishment.

    more honourable state, more courtship lives
    in carrion flies than romeo. they may seize
    on the white wonder of dear juliet's hand
