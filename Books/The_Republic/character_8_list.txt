Form of the Good - 
                Among the Forms, one stands out as most important.
This is the Form of the Good. Plato is unable to tell us exactly
what the Form of The Good is, but he does tell us that it is the
source of intelligibility and of our capacity to know, and also
that it is responsible for bringing all of the other Forms into existence.
He compares its role in the intelligible realm to the role of the
sun in the visible realm. The Form of the Good is the ultimate object
of knowledge; it is only once one grasps the Form of the Good that
one reaches the highest grade of cognitive activity, understanding. Therefore,
it is only after he grasps the Form of the Good that a philosopher-in-training
becomes a philosopher-king.
