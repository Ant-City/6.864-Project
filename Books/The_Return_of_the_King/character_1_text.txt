 days. if gondor falls, or the ring is taken, then the shire will be no refuge.’
‘you do not comfort me,’ said pippin, but nonetheless sleep crept over him. the last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks, glimmering like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the light of the westering moon. he wondered where frodo was, and if he was already in mordor, or if he was dead; and he did not know that frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the coming of the day.
pippin woke to the sound of voices. another day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by. it was twilight: the cold dawn was at hand again, and chill grey mists were about them. shadowfax stood steaming with sweat, but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness. many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him, and behind them in the mist loomed a wall of stone. partly ruinous it seemed, but already before the night was

and, if only on one leg, or at least be left still upon our knees.’
‘rightly said!’ cried beregond, rising and striding to and fro. ‘nay, though all things must come utterly to an end in time, gondor shall not perish yet. not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build a hill of carrion before them. there are still other fastnesses, and secret ways of escape into the mountains. hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley where the grass is green.’
‘all the same, i wish it was over for good or ill.’ said pippin. ‘i am no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle; but waiting on the edge of one that i can’t escape is worst of all. what a long day it seems already! i should be happier, if we were not obliged to stand and watch, making no move, striking nowhere first. no stroke would have been struck in rohan, i think, but for gandalf.’
‘ah, there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!’ said beregond. ‘but things may change

‘twenty-nine!’ said the lad and whistled. ‘why, you are quite old! as old as my uncle iorlas. still,’ he added hopefully, ‘i wager i could stand you on your head or lay you on your back.’
‘maybe you could, if i let you,’ said pippin with a laugh. ‘and maybe i could do the same to you: we know some wrestling tricks in my little country. where, let me tell you, i am considered uncommonly large and strong; and i have never allowed anyone to stand me on my head. so if it came to a trial and nothing else would serve, i might have to kill you. for when you are older, you will learn that folk are not always what they seem; and though you may have taken me for a soft stranger-lad and easy prey, let me warn you: i am not, i am a halfling, hard, bold, and wicked!’ pippin pu

elt more like unneeded baggage than ever, and he wondered, if there was a fight, what he should do. supposing the king’s small escort was trapped and overcome, but he escaped into the darkness - alone in the wild fields of rohan with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles? ‘no good!’ he thought. he drew his sword and tightened his belt.
the sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud, but suddenly it rode out clear again. then they all heard the sound of hoofs, and at the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on the path from the fords. the moonlight glinted here and there on the points of spears. the number of the pursuers could not be told, but they seemed no fewer than the king’s escort, at the least.
when they were some fifty paces off, éomer cried in a loud voice: ‘halt! halt! who rides in rohan?’
the pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand. a silence followed: and then in the moonlight, a horseman could be seen dismounting and walking

‘too often have i heard of duty,’ she cried. ‘but am i not of the house of eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse? i have waited on faltering feet long enough. since they falter no longer, it seems, may i not now spend my life as i will?’
‘few may do that with honour,’ he answered. ‘but as for you, lady: did you not accept the charge to govern the people until their lord’s return? if you had not been chosen, then some marshal or captain would have been set in the same place, and he could not ride away from his charge, were he weary of it or no.’
‘shall i always be chosen?’ she said bitterly. ‘shall i always be left behind when the riders depart, to mind the house while they win renown, and find food and beds when they return?’
‘a time may come soon,’ said he, ‘when none will return. then there will be need of valour without renown, for none shall remember the deeds that are done in the last defence of your homes. yet the deeds will not be le

aragorn cried aloud so that all could hear: ‘friends, forget your weariness! ride now, ride! we must come to the stone of erech ere this day passes, and long still is the way.’ so without looking back they rode the mountain-fields, until they came to a bridge over the growing torrent and found a road that went down into the land.
lights went out in house and hamlet as they came, and doors were shut, and folk that were afield cried in terror and ran wild like hunted deer. ever there rose the same cry in the gathering night: ‘the king of the dead! the king of the dead is come upon us!’
bells were ringing far below, and all men fled before the face of aragorn; but the grey company in their haste rode like hunters, until their horses were stumbling with weariness. and thus, just ere midnight, and in a darkness as black as the caverns in the mountains, they came at last to the hill of erech.

his last day, merry had ridden by himself just behind the king, saying nothing, and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of rohan that he heard the men behind him using. it was a language in which there seemed to be many words that he knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the shire, yet he could not piece the words together. at times some rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and merry felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about.
all the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the day’s end. he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had got to; and what would become of aragorn and legolas and gimli. then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of frodo and sam. ‘i am forgetting them!’ he said to himself reproachfully. ‘and yet they are more important than all the rest of us. and i came to help them; but now they must be hundreds of miles away, if they are still alive.’ he shivered.

‘at dawn three days ago, lord,’ he said. ‘shadowfax came like a wind out of the west to edoras, and gandalf brought tidings of your victory to gladden our hearts. but he brought also word from you to hasten the gathering of the riders. and then came the winged shadow.’
‘the winged shadow?’ said théoden. ‘we saw it also, but that was in the dead of night before gandalf left us.’
‘maybe, lord,’ said dúnhere. ‘yet the same, or another like to it, a flying darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird, passed over edoras that morning, and all men were shaken with fear. for it stooped upon meduseld, and as it came low, almost to the gable, there came a cry that stopped our hearts. then it was that gandalf counselled us not to assemble in the fields, but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains. and he bade us to kindle no more lights or fires than barest need asked. so it has been done. gandalf spoke with gr

taking counsel with him. night came on, and the half-seen heads of the mountains westward were crowned with stars, but the east was dark and blank. the marching stones faded slowly from sight, but still beyond them, blacker than the gloom, brooded the vast crouching shadow of the dwimorberg.
‘the paths of the dead,’ he muttered to himself. ‘the paths of the dead? what does all this mean? they have all left me now. they have all gone to some doom: gandalf and pippin to war in the east; and sam and frodo to mordor; and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths of the dead. but my turn will come soon enough, i suppose. i wonder what they are all talking about, and what the king means to do. for i must go where he goes now.’
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he was very hungry, and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp felt the same. but at that very moment a trumpet sounded, and a man came summoning him, the king’s esquire, to

suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb, frozen as it were to listening stones. pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears; but beregond, who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of faramir, remained there, stiffened, staring out with starting eyes. pippin knew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard long ago in the marish of the shire, but now it was grown in power and hatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair.
at last beregond spoke with an effort. ‘they have come!’ he said. ‘take courage and look! there are fell things below.’
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall. the pelennor lay dim beneath him, fading away to the scarce guessed line of the great river. but now wheeling swiftly across it, like shadows of untimely ni

so now at last the city was besieged, enclosed in a ring of foes. the rammas was broken, and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy. the last word to come from outside the walls was brought by men flying down the northward road ere the gate was shut. they were the remnant of the guard that was kept at that point where the way from anórien and rohan ran into the townlands: ingold led them, the same who had admitted gandalf and pippin less than five days before, while the sun still rose and there was hope in the morning.
‘there is no news of the rohirrim,’ he said. ‘rohan will not come now. or if they come, it will not avail us. the new host that we had tidings of has come first, from over the river by way of andros, it is said. they are strong: battalions of orcs of the eye, and countless companies of men of a new sort that we have not met before. not tall, but broad and grim, bear

if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. his heart beat slowly. time seemed poised in uncertainty. they were too late! too late was worse than never! perhaps théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.
then suddenly merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. wind was in his face! light was glimmering. far, far away, in the south the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond them.
but at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the city. for a searing second it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle: and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom.
at that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve bef

out all. fire and smoke and stench was in the air; for many engines had been burned or cast into the fire-pits, and many of the slain also, while here and there lay many carcases of the great southron monsters, half-burned, or broken by stone-cast, or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of morthond. the flying rain had ceased for a time, and the sun gleamed up above; but all the lower city was still wrapped in a smouldering reek.
already men were labouring to clear a way through the jetsam of battle; and now out from the gate came some bearing litters. gently they laid éowyn upon soft pillows; but the king’s body they covered with a great cloth of gold, and they bore torches about him, and their flames, pale in the sunlight, were fluttered by the wind.
so théoden and éowyn came to the city of gondor, and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the ash and fume of the burned circle, and went on and up along the streets of stone. to merry the asce

merry seized his hand and kissed it. ‘i am frightfully sorry,’ he said. ‘go at once! ever since that night at bree we have been a nuisance to you. but it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less than they mean. we fear to say too much. it robs us of the right words when a jest is out of place.’
‘i know that well, or i would not deal with you in the same way ‘ said aragorn. ‘may the shire live for ever unwithered!’ and kissing merry he went out, and gandalf went with him.
pippin remained behind. ‘was there ever any one like him?’ he said. ‘except gandalf, of course. i think they must be related. my dear ass, your pack is lying by your bed, and you had it on your back when i met you. he saw it all the time, of course. and anyway i have some stuff of my own. come on now! longbottom leaf it is. fill up while i run and see about some f

swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains, and the dark tryst at erech, and the great ride thence, ninety leagues and three, to pelargir on anduin. ‘four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rode from the black stone,’ he said. ‘and lo! in the darkness of mordor my hope rose; for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible to look upon. some i saw riding, some striding, yet all moving with the same great speed. silent they were, but there was a gleam in their eyes. in the uplands of lamedon they overtook our horses, and swept round us, and would have passed us by, if aragorn had not forbidden them.
‘at his command they fell back. “even the shades of men are obedient to his will,” i thought. “they may serve his needs yet! “

and so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army. bergil was with him, and he also was downcast; for his father was to march leading a company of the men of the city: he could not rejoin the guard until his case was judged. in that same company pippin was also to go, as a soldier of gondor. merry could see him not far off, a small but upright figure among the tall men of minas tirith.
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move. troop by troop, and company by company, they wheeled and went off eastward. and long after they had passed away out of sight down the great road to the causeway, merry stood there. the last glint of the morning sun on spear and helm twinkled and was lost, and still he remained with bowed head

the messenger put these aside, and there to the wonder and dismay of all the captains he held up first the short sword that sam had carried, and next a grey cloak with an elven-brooch, and last the coat of mithril-mail that frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments. a blackness came before their eyes, and it seemed to them in a moment of silence that the world stood still, but their hearts were dead and their last hope gone. pippin who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief.

the tower of cirith ungol

sam roused himself painfully from the ground. for a moment he wondered where he was, and then all the misery and despair returned to him. he was in the deep dark outside the under-gate of the orcs' stronghold; its brazen doors were shut. he must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against them; but how long he had lain there he did not know. then he had been on fire, desperate and furious; now he was shivering and cold. he crept to the doors and pressed his ears against them.

ing southwards, as he came back to shelob’s tunnel, not west. out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of march in the shire-reckoning. and even now aragorn was leading the black fleet from pelargir, and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the stonewain valley, while in minas tirith flames were rising and pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of denethor. yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam. they were not forgotten. but they were far beyond aid, and no thought could yet bring any help to samwise hamfast’s son; he was utterly alone.
he came back at last to the stone door of the orc-passage, and still unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it, he scrambled over as before and dropped softly to the ground. then he made his way stealthily to the outlet of shelob’s tunnel, where the rags of her great web were still blowing and swaying in the cold airs. for cold they seemed t

all was ominously quiet. the light was no more than that of dusk at a dark day’s end. the vast vapours that arose in mordor and went streaming westward passed low overhead, a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit again beneath with a sullen glow of red.
sam looked up towards the orc-tower, and suddenly from its narrow windows lights stared out like small red eyes. he wondered if they were some signal. his fear of the orcs, forgotten for a while in his wrath and desperation, now returned. as far as he could see, there was only one possible course for him to take: he must go on and try to find the main entrance to the dreadful tower; but his knees felt weak, and he found that he was trembling. drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns of th

t beyond the crown of the pass and took one step veritably down into the land of mordor, that step would be irrevocable. he could never come back. without any clear purpose he drew out the ring and put it on again. immediately he felt the great burden of its weight, and felt afresh, but now more strong and urgent than ever, the malice of the eye of mordor, searching, trying to pierce the shadows that it had made for its own defence, but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt.
as before, sam found that his hearing was sharpened, but that to his sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague. the rocky walls of the path were pale, as if seen through a mist, but still at a distance he heard the bubbling of shelob in her misery: and harsh and clear, and very close it seemed, he heard cries and the clash of metal. he sprang to his feet, and pressed himself against the wall beside the road. he was glad of the ring, for here was yet another company of orcs on the march. or so at fi

rst he thought. then suddenly he realized that it was not so, his hearing had deceived him: the orc-cries came from the tower, whose topmost horn was now right above him, on the left hand of the cleft.
sam shuddered and tried to force himself to move. there was plainly some devilry going on. perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the orcs had mastered them, and they were tormenting frodo, or even savagely hacking him to pieces. he listened; and as he did a gleam of hope came to him. there could not be much doubt: there was fighting in the tower, the orcs must be at war among themselves, shagrat and gorbag had come to blows. faint as was the hope that his guess brought him, it was enough to

 rouse him. there might be just a chance. his love for frodo rose above all other thoughts, and forgetting his peril he cried aloud: ‘i’m coming, mr. frodo!’
he ran forward to the climbing path, and over it. at once the road turned left and plunged steeply down. sam had crossed into mordor.
he took off the ring, moved it may be by some deep premonition of danger, though to himself he thought only that he wished to see more clearly. `better have a look at the worst,’ he muttered. `no good blundering about in a fog!’
hard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his gaze. before his feet the highest ridge of the ephel dúath fell steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trough, on the further side of which there rose another ridge, much lower, its edge

 notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out black against the red light behind them: it was the grim morgai, the inner ring of the fences of the land. far beyond it, but almost straight ahead, across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires, there was a great burning glow; and from it rose in huge columns a swirling smoke, dusty red at the roots, black above where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofed in all the accursed land.
sam was looking at orodruin, the mountain of fire. ever and anon the furnaces far below its ashen cone would grow hot and with a great surging and throbbing pour forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides. some would flow blazing towards barad-dûr down great channels; some would wind their way into the stony plain, until they cooled and lay like twisted dragon-shapes vomited from the tormented earth. in such an hour of labour sam beheld mount doom, and the light of it, cut off by the hig

h screen of the ephel dúath from those who climbed up the path from the west, now glared against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched with blood.
in that dreadful light sam stood aghast, for now, looking to his left, he could see the tower of cirith ungol in all its strength. the horn that he had seen from the other side was only its topmost turret. its eastern face stood up in three great tiers from a shelf in the mountain-wall far below; its back was to a great cliff behind, from which it jutted out in pointed bastions, one above the other, diminishing as they rose, with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looked north-east and south-east. about the lowest tier,

 two hundred feet below where sam now stood, there was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow court. its gate, upon the near south-eastern side, opened on a broad road, the outer parapet of which ran upon the brink of a precipice, until it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness to join the road that came over the morgul pass. then on it went through a jagged rift in the morgai out into the valley of gorgoroth and away to barad-dûr. the narrow upper way on which sam stood leapt swiftly down by stair and steep path to meet the main road under the frowning walls close to the tower-gate.
as he gazed at it suddenly sam understood, almost with a shock, that this stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of mordor, but to keep them in. it was indeed one of the works of gondor long ago, an eastern outpost of the defences of ithilien, made when, after the last alliance, men of westernesse kept watch on the evil land of sauron where his creatures still lurk

nd treachery had yielded up the tower to the lord of the ringwraiths, and now for long years it had been held by evil things. since his return to mordor, sauron had found it useful; for he had few servants but many slaves of fear, and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escape from mordor. though if an enemy were so rash as to try to enter that land secretly, then it was also a last unsleeping guard against any that might pass the vigilance of morgul and of shelob.
only too clearly sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down under those many-eyed walls and pass the watchful gate. and even if he did so, he could not go far on the guarded road beyond: not even the black shadows, lying deep where the red glow could not reach, would shield him long from the night-eyed orcs. but desperate as that road might be, his task was now far worse: not to avoid the gate and escape, but to enter it, alone.
his thought turned to the ring, but there was no comfort there, only dread

and danger. no sooner had he come in sight of mount doom, burning far away, than he was aware of a change in his burden. as it drew near the great furnaces where, in the deeps of time, it had been shaped and forged, the ring’s power grew, and it became more fell, untameable save by some mighty will. as sam stood there, even though the ring was not on him but hanging by its chain about his neck, he felt himself enlarged, as if he were robed in a huge distorted shadow of himself, a vast and ominous threat halted upon the walls of mordor. he felt that he had from now on only two choices: to forbear the ring, though it would torment him; or to claim it, and challenge the power that sat in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows. already the ring tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason. wild fa

in that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to hold him firm;

must go down to the gate and not linger any more. with a shrug of his shoulders, as if to shake off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms, he began slowly to descend. with each step he seemed to diminish. he had not gone far before he had shrunk again to a very small and frightened hobbit. he was now passing under the very walls of the tower, and the cries and sounds of fighting could be heard with his unaided ears. at the moment the noise seemed to be coming from the court behind the outer wall.
sam was about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway into the red glow there came two orcs running. they did not turn towards him. they were making for the main road; but even as they ran they stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still. sam had seen no arrows, but he guessed that the orcs had been shot down by others on the battlements or hidden in the shadow of the gate. he went on, hugging the wall on his left. one look upward had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it. t

dge, to overhanging courses like inverted steps. the gate was the only way.
he crept on; and as he went he wondered how many orcs lived in the tower with shagrat, and how many gorbag had, and what they were quarrelling about, if that was what was happening. shagrat’s company had seemed to be about forty, and gorbag’s more than twice as large; but of course shagrat’s patrol had only been a part of his garrison. almost certainly they were quarrelling about frodo, and the spoil. for a second sam halted, for suddenly things seemed clear to him, almost as if he had seen them with his eyes. the mithril coat! of course, frodo was wearing it, and they would find it. and from what sam had heard gorbag would covet it. but the orders of the dark tower were at present frodo’s only protection, and if they were set aside, frodo might be killed out of hand at any moment.
‘come on, you miserable sluggard!’ sam cried to himself. `now for it!’ he drew sting and ran towards the open gate. but

ey were like great figures seated upon thrones. each had three joined bodies, and three heads facing outward, and inward, and across the gateway. the heads had vulture-faces, and on their great knees were laid clawlike hands. they seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of stone, immovable, and yet they were aware: some dreadful spirit of evil vigilance abode in them. they knew an enemy. visible or invisible none could pass unheeded. they would forbid his entry, or his escape.
hardening his will sam thrust forward once again, and halted with a jerk, staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and head. then greatly daring, because he could think of nothing else to do, answering a sudden thought that came to him, he drew slowly out the phial of galadriel and held it up. its white light quickened swiftly, and the shadows under the dark arch fled. the monstrous watchers sat there cold and still, revealed in all their hideous shape. for a moment sam caught a glitter in the black stones of the

the very malice of which made him quail; but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble into fear.
he sprang past them; but even as he did so, thrusting the phial back into his bosom, he was aware, as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to behind him, that their vigilance was renewed. and from those evil heads there came a high shrill cry that echoed in the towering walls before him. far up above, like an answering signal, a harsh bell clanged a single stroke.
‘that’s done it!’ said sam. `now i’ve rung the front-door bell! well, come on somebody!’ he cried. `tell captain shagrat that the great elf-warrior has called, with his elf-sword too!’
there was no answer. sam strode forward. sting glittered blue in his hand. the courtyard lay in deep shadow, but he could see that the pavement was strewn with bodies. right at his feet were two orc-archers with knives sticking in their backs. beyond lay many more shapes; some singly as they had been hewn down or shot; others in pair

s, still grappling one another, dead in the very throes of stabbing, throttling, biting. the stones were slippery with dark blood.
two liveries sam noticed, one marked by the red eye, the other by a moon disfigured with a ghastly face of death; but he did not stop to look more closely. across the court a great door at the foot of the tower stood half open, and a red light came through; a large orc lay dead upon the threshold. sam sprang over the body and went in; and then he peered about at a loss.
a wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the mountain-side. it was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on the walls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. many doors and openings could be seen on this side and that; but it was empty save for two or three more bodies sprawling on the floor. from what he had heard of the captains’ talk sam knew that, dead or alive, frodo would most likely be found in

a chamber high up in the turret far above; but he might search for a day before he found the way.
‘it’ll be near the back, i guess,’ sam muttered. `the whole tower climbs backwards-like. and anyway i’d better follow these lights.’
he advanced down the passage, but slowly now, each step more reluctant. terror was beginning to grip him again. there was no sound save the rap of his feet, which seemed to grow to an echoing noise, like the slapping of great hands upon the stones. the dead bodies: the emptiness; the dank black walls that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood; the fear of sudden death lurking in doorway or sh

he had passed beyond the torchlight, almost to a great arched door at the end of the passage, the inner side of the under gate, as he rightly guessed, when there came from high above a dreadful choking shriek. he stopped short. then he heard feet coming. someone was running in great haste down an echoing stairway overhead.
his will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand. it dragged at the chain and clutched the ring. but sam did not put it on; for even as he clasped it to his breast, an orc came clattering down. leaping out of a dark opening at the right, it ran towards him. it was no more than six paces from him when, lifting its head, it saw him; and sam could hear its gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes. it stopped short aghast. for what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword: it saw a great silent shape, cloaked in a grey shadow, looming against the wavering li

ght behind; in one hand it held a sword, the very light of which was a bitter pain, the other was clutched at its breast, but held concealed some nameless menace of power and doom.
for a moment the orc crouched, and then with a hideous yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had come. never was any dog more heartened when its enemy turned tail than sam at this unexpected flight. with a shout he gave chase.
`yes! the elf-warrior is loose!’ he cried. ‘i’m coming. just you show me the way up, or i’ll skin you!’
but the orc was in its own haunts, nimble and well-fed. sam was a stranger, hungry and weary. the stairs were high and steep and winding. sam’s breath began to come in gasps. the orc had soon passed out of sight, and now only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet as it went on and up. every now and again it gave a ye

ll, and the echo ran along the walls. but slowly all sound of it died away.
sam plodded on. he felt that he was on the right road, and his spirits had risen a good deal. he thrust the ring away and tightened his belt. `well, well!’ he said. `if only they all take such a dislike to me and my sting, this may turn out better than i hoped. and anyway it looks as if shagrat, gorbag, and company have done nearly all my job for me. except for that little frightened rat, i do believe there’s nobody left alive in the place!’
and with that he stopped, brought up hard, as if he

 had hit his head against the stone wall. the full meaning of what he had said struck him like a blow. nobody left alive! whose had been that horrible dying shriek? `frodo, frodo! master!’ he cried half sobbing. ‘if they’ve killed you, what shall i do? well, i’m coming at last, right to the top, to see what i must.’
up, up he went. it was dark save for an occasional torch flaring at a turn, or beside some opening that led into the higher levels of the tower. sam tried to count the steps, but after two hundred he lost his reckoning. he was moving quietly now: for he thought that he could hear the sound of voices talking, still some way above. more than one rat remained alive, it seemed.
all at once, when he felt that he could pump out no more breath, nor force his knees to bend again, the stair ended. he stood still. the voices were now loud and near. sam peered about. he had climbed right to the flat roof of the third and highest tier of the tower: an

open space, about twenty yards across, with a low parapet. there the stair was covered by a small domed chamber in the midst of the roof, with low doors facing east and west. eastward sam could see the plain of mordor vast and dark below, and the burning mountain far away. a fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells, and the rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at this distance of many miles the light of them lit the tower-top with a red glare. westward the view was blocked by the base of the great turret that stood at the back of this upper court and reared its horn high above the crest of the encircling hills. light gleamed in a window-slit. its door was not ten yards

 from where sam stood. it was open but dark, and from just within its shadow the voices came.
at first sam did not listen; he took a pace out of the eastward door and looked about. at once he saw that up here the fighting had been fiercest. all the court was choked with dead orcs or their severed and scattered heads and limbs. the place stank of death. a snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent him darting back into hiding. an orc-voice rose in anger, and he knew it again at once, harsh, brutal, cold. it was shagrat speaking, captain of the tower.
`you won’t go again, you say? curse you, snaga, you

re a nazgûl, i wouldn’t.’
`so that’s it, is it?’ yelled shagrat. ‘you’ll do this, and you’ll not do that? and when he does come, you’ll bolt and leave me? no, you won’t! i’ll put red maggot-holes in your belly first.’
out of the turret-door the smaller orc came flying. behind him came shagrat, a large orc with long arms that, as he ran crouching, reached to the ground. but one arm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding; the other hugged a large black bundle. in the red glare sam, cowering behind the stair-door, caught a glimpse of his evil face as it passed: it was scored as if by rending claws and smeared with blood; slaver dripped from its protruding fangs; the mouth snarled like an animal.
as far as sam could see, shagrat hunted snaga round the roof, until ducking and eluding him the smaller orc with a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared. then shagrat halted. out of the eastward door sam could see him now by the parapet, panting, his left claw clenching

 and unclenching feebly. he put the bundle on the floor and with his right claw drew out a long red knife and spat on it. going to the parapet he leaned over, looking down into the outer court far below. twice he shouted but no answer came.
suddenly, as shagrat was stooped over the battlement, his back to the roof-top, sam to his amazement saw that one of the sprawling bodies was moving. it was crawling. it put out a claw and clutched the bundle. it staggered up. in its other hand it held a broad-headed spear with a short broken haft. it was poised for a stabbing thrust. but at that very moment a hiss escaped its teeth, a gasp of pain or hate. quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside, twisted round, and drove his knife into his enemy’s throat.
`got you, gorbag!’ he cried. ‘not quite dead, eh? well, i’ll fin
 
 ___________________________
 
ish my job now.’ he sprang on to the fallen body, and stamped and trampled it in his fury, stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife. satisfied at last, he threw back his head and let out a horrible gurgling yell of triumph. then he licked his knife, and put it between his teeth, and catching up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs.
sam had no time to think. he might have slipped out of the other door, but hardly without being seen; and he could not have played hide-and-seek with this hideous orc for long. he did what was probably the best thing he could have done. he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout. he was no longer holding the ring, but it was there, a hidden power, a cowing menace to the slaves of mordor; and in his hand was sting, and its light smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter of cruel stars in the terrib

le elf-countries, the dream of which was a cold fear to all his kind. and shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure. he stopped, growling, baring his fangs. then once more, orc-fashion, he leapt aside, and as sam sprang at him, using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon, he thrust it hard into his enemy’s face. sam staggered, and before he could recover, shagrat darted past and down the stairs.
sam ran after him, cursing, but he did not go far. soon the thought of frodo returned to him, and he remembered that the other orc had gone back into the turret. here was another dreadful choice, and he had no time to ponder it. if shagrat got away, he would soon get help and come back. but if sam pursued him, the other orc might do some horrible deed up there. and anyway sam might miss shagrat or be killed by him. he turned quickly and ran back up the stairs. `wrong again, i expect,’ he sighed. 
 
 ___________________________
 
`but it’s my job to go right up to the top first, whatever happens afterwards.’
away below shagrat went leaping down the stairs and out over the court and through the gate, bearing his precious burden. if sam could have seen him and known the grief that his escape would bring, he might have quailed. but now his mind was set on the last stage of his search. he came cautiously to the turret-door and stepped inside. it opened into darkness. but soon his staring eyes were aware of a dim light at his right hand. it came from an opening that led to another stairway, dark and narrow: it appeared to go winding up the turret along the inside of its round outer wall. a torch was glimmering from somewhere up a

bove.
softly sam began to climb. he came to the guttering torch, fixed above a door on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward: one of the red eyes that he and frodo had seen from down below by the tunnel’s mouth. quickly sam passed the door and hurried on to the second storey, dreading at any moment to he attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind. he came next to a window looking east and another torch above the door to a passage through the middle of the turret. the door was open, the passage dark save for the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from outside filtering through the window-slit. but here the stair stopped and climbed no further. sam crept into the passage. on either side

 there was a low door; both were closed and locked. there was no sound at all.
`a dead end,’ muttered sam; `and after all my climb! this can’t be the top of the tower. but what can i do now?’
he ran back to the lower storey and tried the door. it would not move. he ran up again, and sweat began to trickle down his face. he felt that even minutes were precious, but one by one they escaped; and he could do nothing. he cared no longer for shagrat or snaga or any other orc that was ever spawned. he longed only for his master, for one sight of his face or one touch of his hand.

eling finally defeated, he sat on a step below the level of the passage-floor and bowed his head into his hands. it was quiet, horribly quiet. the torch, that was already burning low when he arrived, sputtered and went out; and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide. and then softly, to his own surprise, there at the vain end of his long journey and his grief, moved by what thought in his heart he could not tell, sam began to sing.
his voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark tower: the voice of a forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening orc could possibly mistake for the clear song of an elven-lord. he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire, and snatches of mr. bilbo’s rhymes that came into his mind like fleeting glimpses of the country of his home. and then suddenly new strength rose in him, and his voice rang out, while words of his own came unbidden to fit the simple tune.

`beyond all towers strong and high,’ he began again, and then he stopped short. he thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him. but now he could hear nothing. yes, he could hear something, but not a voice. footsteps were approaching. now a door was being opened quietly in the passage above; the hinges creaked. sam crouched down listening. the door closed with a dull thud; and then a snarling orc-voice rang out.
‘ho la! you up there, you dunghill rat! stop your squeaking, or i’ll come and deal with you. d’you hear?’
there was no answer.
‘all right,’ growled snaga. `but i’ll come and have a look at you all the same, and see what you’re up to.’
the hinges creaked again, and sam, now peering over the corner of the passage-threshold, saw a flicker of light in an open doorway, and the dim sha

pe of an orc coming out. he seemed to be carrying a ladder. suddenly the answer dawned on sam: the topmost chamber was reached by a trap-door in the roof of the passage. snaga thrust the ladder upwards, steadied it, and then clambered out of sight. sam heard a bolt drawn back. then he heard the hideous voice speaking again.
`you lie quiet, or you’ll pay for it! you’ve not got long to live in peace, i guess; but if you don’t want the fun to begin right now, keep your trap shut, see? there’s a reminder for you!’ there was a sound like the crack of a whip.
at that rage blazed in sam’s heart to a sudden fury. he sprang up, ran, and went up the ladder like a cat. his head came out in the middle of the floor of a large round chamber. a

red lamp hung from its roof; the westward window-slit was high and dark. something was lying on the floor by the wall under the window, but over it a black orc-shape was straddled. it raised a whip a second time, but the blow never fell.
with a cry sam leapt across the floor, sting in hand. the orc wheeled round, but before it could make a move sam slashed its whip-hand from its arm. howling with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head-down at him. sam’s next blow went wide, and thrown off his balance he fell backwards, clutching at the orc as it stumbled over him. before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud. the orc in its wild haste had tripped on the ladder-head and fallen through the open trap-door. sam gave no more thought to it. he ran to the figure huddled on the floor. it was frodo.
he was naked, lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags: his arm was flung up, shielding his head, and across his side there ran an ugly

 whip-weal.
`frodo! mr. frodo, my dear!’ cried sam, tears almost blinding him. `it’s sam, i’ve come!’ he half lifted his master and hugged him to his breast. frodo opened his eyes.
`am i still dreaming?’ he muttered. `but the other dreams were horrible.’
`you’re not dreaming at all, master,’ said sam. `it’s real. it’s me. i’ve come.’
`i can hardly believe it,’ said frodo, clutching him. `there was an orc with a whip, and then it turns into sam! then i wasn’t dreaming after all when i heard that singing down below, and i tried to answer? was it you?’
‘it was indeed, mr. frodo. i’d given up hope, almost. i couldn’t find you.
well, you have now, sam, dear sam, said frodo, and he la back in sam’s gentle arms, closing his eyes, like a child at rest when night-fears are driven away by some loved voice or hand.
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness; but it was not allowed. it was not enough for him to find hi

s master, he had still to try and save him. he kissed frodo’s forehead. `come! wake up mr. frodo!’ he said, trying to sound as cheerful as he had when he drew back the curtains at bag end on a summer’s morning.
frodo sighed and sat up. `where are we? how did i get here?’ he asked.
‘there’s no time for tales till we get somewhere else, mr. frodo,’ said sam. `but you’re in the top of that tower you and me saw from away down by the tunnel before the orcs got you. how long ago that was i don’t know. more than a day, i guess.’
`only that?’ said frodo. `it seems weeks. you must tell me all about it, if we get a chance. something hit me, didn’t it? and i fell into darkness and foul dreams, and woke and found that waking was worse. orcs were all round me. i think they had just been pouring some horrible burning drink down my throat. my head gr

`you won’t, if you talk about them, mr. frodo,’ said sam. ‘and if we don’t want to see them again, the sooner we get going the better. can you walk?’
`yes, i can walk,’ said frodo, getting up slowly. ‘i am not hurt sam. only i feel very tired, and i’ve a pain here.’ he put his hand to the back of his neck above his left shoulder. he stood up, and it looked to sam as if he was clothed in flame: his naked skin was scarlet in the light of the lamp above. twice he paced across the floor.
`that’s better!’ he said, his spirits rising a little. `i didn’t dare to move when i was left alone, or one of the guards came. until the yelling and fighting began. the two big brutes: they quarrelled, i think. over me

 and my things. i lay here terrified. and then all went deadly quiet, and that was worse.’
`yes, they quarrelled, seemingly,’ said sam. ‘there must have been a couple of hundred of the dirty creatures in this place. a bit of a tall order for sam gamgee, as you might say. but they’ve done all the killing of themselves. that’s lucky, but it’s too long to make a song about, till we’re out of here. now what’s to be done? you can’t go walking in the black land in naught but your skin, mr. frodo.’
`they’ve taken everything, sam,’ said frodo. `everything i had. do you understand? everything!’ he cowered on the floor again with bowed head, as his own words brought home to him the fullness of the disaster, and despair overwh

elmed him. ‘the quest has failed sam. even if we get out of here, we can’t escape. only elves can escape. away, away out of middle-earth, far away over the sea. if even that is wide enough to keep the shadow out.’
`no, not everything, mr. frodo. and it hasn’t failed, not yet. i took it, mr. frodo, begging your pardon. and i’ve kept it safe. it’s round my neck now, and a terrible burden it is, too.’ sam fumbled for the ring and its chain. `but i suppose you must take it back.’ now it had come to it, sam felt reluctant to give up the ring and burden his master with it again.
`you’ve got it?’ gasped frodo. `you’ve got it here? sam, you’re a marvel!’ then quickly and strangely his tone changed. `give it to me!’ he cried, standing up, holding out a trembling hand. `give it me at once! you can’t have it!’
‘all right, mr. frodo,’ said sam, rather startled. ‘here it is!’ slo

wly he drew the ring out and passed the chain over his head. `but you’re in the land of mordor now, sir; and when you get out, you’ll see the fiery mountain and all. you’ll find the ring very dangerous now, and very hard to bear. if it’s too hard a job, i could share it with you, maybe?’
`no, no!’ cried frodo, snatching the ring and chain from sam’s hands. `no you won’t, you thief!’ he panted, staring at sam with eyes wide with fear and enmity. then suddenly, clasping the ring in one clenched fist, he stood aghast. a mist seemed to clear from his eyes, and he passed a hand over his aching brow. the hideous vision had seemed so real to him, half bemused as he was still with wound and fear. sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc again, leering and pawing at his treasure, a foul little creature with greedy eyes and slobbering mouth. but now the vision had passed. there was sam kneeling befor

e him, his face wrung with pain, as if he had been stabbed in the heart; tears welled from his eyes.
‘o sam!’ cried frodo. `what have i said? what have i done? forgive me! after all you have done. it is the horrible power of the ring. i wish it had never, never, been found. but don’t mind me, sam. i must carry the burden to the end. it can’t be altered. you can’t come between me and this doom.’
‘that’s all right, mr. frodo,’ said sam, rubbing his sleeve across his eyes. `i understand. but i can still help, can’t i? i’ve got to get you out of here. at once, see! but first you want some clothes and gear and then some food. the clothes will be the easiest part. as we’re in mordor, we’d, best dress up mordor-fashion; and anyway there isn’t no choice. it’ll have to be orc-stuff for you, mr. frodo, i’m afraid. and for me too. if we go together, we’d best match. now put this round you!’
sam unclasped his grey clo

rs. then unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor. he drew sting from its sheath. hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade. `i was forgetting this, mr. frodo,’ he said. `no, they didn’t get everything! you lent me sting, if you remember, and the lady’s glass. i’ve got them both still. but lend them to me a little longer, mr. frodo. i must go and see what i can find. you stay here. walk about a bit and ease your legs. i shan’t be long. i shan’t have to go far.’
`take care, sam!’ said frodo. `and be quick! there may be orcs still alive, lurking in wait.’
‘i’ve got to chance it,’ said sam. he stepped to the trap-door and slipped down the ladder. in a minute his head reappeared. he threw a long knife on the floor.
`there’s something that might be useful,’ he said. ‘he’s dead: the one that whipped you. broke his neck, it seems, in his hurry. now you draw up the ladder, if you can, mr. frodo; and don’t you let it down till you hear me call the password

. elbereth i’ll call. what the elves say. no orc would say that.’
frodo sat for a while and shivered, dreadful fears chasing one another through his mind. then he got up, drew the grey elven-cloak about him, and to keep his mind occupied, began to walk to and fro, prying and peering into every corner of his prison.
it was not very long, though fear made it seem an hour at least, before he heard sam’s voice calling softly from below: elbereth, elbereth. frodo let down the light ladder. up came sam, puffing, heaving a great bundle on his head. he let it fall with a thud.
`quick now. mr. frodo!’ he said. `i’ve had a bit of a search to find anything small enough for the likes of us. we’ll have to make do. but we must hurry. i’ve met nothing alive, and i’ve seen nothing but i’m not easy. i think this place is being watched. i can’t explain it, but well: it feels to me as if one

he opened the bundle. frodo looked in disgust at the contents, but there was nothing for it: he had to put the things on, or go naked. there were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast-fell, and a tunic of dirty leather. he drew them on. over the tunic went a coat of stout ring-mail, short for a full-sized orc, too long for frodo and heavy. about it he clasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad-bladed stabbing-sword. sam had brought several orc-helmets. one of them fitted frodo well enough, a black cap with iron rim, and iron hoops covered with leather upon which the evil eye was painted in red above the beaklike nose-guard.
`the morgul-stuff, gorbag’s gear, was a better fit and better made,’ said sam; `but it wouldn’t do, i guess, to go carrying his tokens into mordor, not after this business here. well, there you are, mr. frodo. a perfect little orc, if i may make so bold-at least you would be, if we co

uld cover your face with a mask, give you longer arms, and make you bow-legged. this will hide some of the tell-tales.’ he put a large black cloak round frodo’s shoulders. `now you’re ready! you can pick up a shield as we go.’
‘what about you, sam?’ said frodo. `aren’t we going to match?’
`well, mr. frodo, i’ve been thinking,’ said sam. ‘i’d best not leave any of my stuff behind, and we can’t destroy it. and i can’t wear orc-mail over all my clothes, can i? i’ll just have to cover up.’
he knelt down and carefully folded his elven-cloak. it went into a surprisingly small roll. this he put into his pack that lay on the floor. standing up, he slung it behind his back, put an orc-helm on his head, and cast another black cloak about his shoulders. `there!’ he said. `now we match, near enough. and now we must be off!

‘i can’t go all the way at a run, sam,’ said frodo with a wry smile. ‘i hope you’ve made inquiries about inns along the road? or have you forgotten about food and drink?’
`save me, but so i had!’ said sam. he whistled in dismay. ‘bless me, mr. frodo, but you’ve gone and made me that hungry and thirsty! i don’t know when drop or morsel last passed my lips. i’d forgotten it, trying to find you. but let me think! last time i looked i’d got about enough of that waybread, and of what captain faramir gave us, to keep me on my legs for a couple of weeks at a pinch. but if there’s a drop left in my bottle, there’s no more. that’s not going to be enough for two, nohow. don’t ores eat, a

`no, they eat and drink, sam. the shadow that bred them can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own. i don’t think it gave life to the ores, it only ruined them and twisted them; and if they are to live at all, they have to live like other living creatures. foul waters and foul meats they’ll take, if they can get no better, but not poison. they’ve fed me, and so i’m better off than you. there must be food and water somewhere in this place.’ `but there’s no time to look for them,’ said sam.

hile you were away. indeed they did not take everything. i’ve found my food-bag among some rags on the floor. they’ve rummaged it, of course. but i guess they disliked the very look and smell of the lembas, worse than gollum did. it’s scattered about and some of it is trampled and broken, but i’ve gathered it together. it’s not far short of what you’ve got. but they’ve taken faramir’s food, and they’ve slashed up my water-bottle.’
`well, there’s no more to be said,’ said sam. `we’ve got enough to start on. but the water’s going to be a bad business. but come mr. frodo! off we go, or a whole lake of it won’t do us any good!’
‘not till you’ve had a mouthful, sam,’ said frodo. `i won’t budge. here, take this elven-cake, and drink that last drop in your bottle! the whole thing is quite hopeless, so it’s no good worrying about tomorrow. it probably won’t come.’
at last they started. down the ladder they climbed, and then sam took it and laid it in

ey halted. even from where they stood they felt the malice of the watchers beating on them, black silent shapes on either side of the gate through which the glare of mordor dimly showed. as they threaded their way among the hideous bodies of the ores each step became more difficult. before they even reached the archway they were brought to a stand. to move an inch further was a pain and weariness to will and limb.
frodo had no strength for such a battle. he sank to the ground. `i can’t go on, sam,’ he murmured. `i’m going to faint. i don’t know what’s come over me.’
`i do, mr. frodo. hold up now! it’s the gate. there’s some devilry there. but i got through, and i’m going to get out. it can’t be more dangerous than before. now for it!’
sam drew out the elven-glass of galadriel again. as if to do honour to his hardihood, and to grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit-hand that had done such deeds, the phial blazed forth suddenly, so that all the shadowy court wa

‘gilthoniel, a elbereth!’ sam cried. for, why he did not know, his thought sprang back suddenly to the elves in the shire, and the song that drove away the black rider in the trees.
‘aiya elenion ancalima!’ cried frodo once again behind him.
the will of the watchers was broken with a suddenness like the snapping of a cord, and frodo and sam stumbled forward. then they ran. through the gate and past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes. there was a crack. the keystone of the arch crashed almost on their heels, and the wall above crumbled, and fell in ruin. only by a hair did they escape. a bell clanged; and from the watchers there went up a high and dreadful wail. far up above in the darkness it was answered. out of the black sky there came dropping like a bolt a winged shape, rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek

sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast. ‘run, mr. frodo!’ he cried. ‘no, not that way! there’s a sheer drop over the wall. follow me!’
down the road from the gate they fled. in fifty paces, with a swift bend round a jutting bastion of the cliff, it took them out of sight from the tower. they had escaped for the moment. cowering back against the rock they drew breath, and then they clutched at their hearts. perching now on the wall beside the ruined gate the

‘this won’t do, sam,’ said frodo. ‘if we were real orcs, we ought to be dashing back to the tower, not running away. the first enemy we meet will know us. we must get off this road somehow.’
‘but we can’t,’ said sam, ‘not without wings.’
the eastern faces of the ephel dúath were sheer, falling in cliff and precipice to the black trough that lay between them and the inner ridge. a short way beyond the way-meeting, after another steep incline, a flying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and bore t

‘quick, sam! over we go!’ cried frodo. they scrambled on to the low parapet of the bridge. fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into the gulf, for the slopes of the morgai had already risen almost to the level of the road; but it was too dark for them to guess the depth of the fall.
‘well, here goes, mr. frodo,’ said sam. ‘good-bye!’
he let go. frodo followed. and even as they fell they heard the rush of horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc-feet running up behind. but sam would have laughed, if he had dared. half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed, in a drop of no more than a dozen feet, with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had expected: a tangle of thorny bushes. there sam lay still, softly sucking a scratched hand.

wn, this is just what i’d have looked for. these thorns must be a foot long by the feel of them; they’ve stuck through everything i’ve got on. wish i’d a’put that mail-shirt on!’
‘orc-mail doesn’t keep these thorns out,’ said frodo. ‘not even a leather jerkin is any good.’
they had a struggle to get out of the thicket. the thorns and briars were as tough as wire and as clinging as claws. their cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free at last.
‘now down we go, sam,’ frodo whispered. ‘down into the valley quick, and then turn northward, as soon as ever we can.’
day was coming again in the world outside, and far beyond the glooms of mordor the sun was climbing over the eastern rim of middle-earth; but here all was still dark as night. the mountain smouldered and its fires went out. the glare faded from the cliffs. the easterly wind that had been blowing ever since they left ithilien now seemed dead. slowly and painfully they clambered down, groping,

stumbling, scrambling among rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows, down and down until they could go no further.
at length they stopped, and sat side by side, their backs against a boulder. both were sweating. ‘if shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of water, i’d shake his hand,’ said sam.
‘don’t say such things!’ said frodo. ‘it only makes it worse.’ then he stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spoke no more for a while. at last with a struggle he got up again. to his amazement he found that sam was asleep. ‘wake up, sam!’ he said. ‘come on! it’s time we made another effort.’
sam scrambled to his feet. ‘well i never!’ he said. ‘i must have dropped off. it’s a long time, mr. frodo, since i had a proper sleep, and my eyes just closed down on

frodo now led the way, northward as near as he could guess, among the stones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine. but presently he stopped again.
‘it’s no good, sam,’ he said. ‘i can’t manage it. this mail-shirt, i mean. not in my present state. even my mithril-coat seemed heavy when i was tired. this is far heavier. and what’s the use of it? we shan’t win through by fighting.’
‘but we may have some to do,’ said sam. ‘and there’s knives and stray arrows. that gollum isn’t dead, for one thing. i don’t like to think of you with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark.’
‘look here, sam dear lad,’ said frodo: ‘i am tired, weary, i haven’t a hope left. but i have to go on trying to get to the mountain, as long as i can move. the ring is enough. this extra weight is killing me. it must go. but don’t think i’m ungrateful. i hate to think of the foul work you must have

‘don’t talk about it, mr. frodo. bless you! i’d carry you on my back, if i could. let it go then!’
frodo laid aside his cloak and took off the orc-mail and flung it away. he shivered a little. ‘what i really need is something warm,’ he said. ‘it’s gone cold, or else i’ve caught a chill.’
‘you can have my cloak, mr. frodo,’ said sam. he unslung his pack and took out the elven-cloak. ‘how’s this, mr. frodo?’ he said. ‘you wrap that orc-rag close round you, and put the belt outside it. then this can go over all. it don’t look quite orc-fashion, but it’ll keep you warmer; and i daresay it’ll keep you from harm better than any other gear. it was made by the lady.’
frodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch. ‘that’s better!’ he said. ‘i feel much lighter. i can go on now. but this blind dark seems to b

‘there now, mr. frodo, it’s you that’s talking of water this time!’ said sam. ‘if only the lady could see us or hear us, i’d say to her: “your ladyship, all we want is light and water: just clean water and plain daylight, better than any jewels, begging your pardon.” but it’s a long way to lórien.’ sam sighed and waved his hand towards the heights of the ephel dúath, now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky.

black, visible shapes. light was growing behind them. slowly it crept towards the north. there was battle far above in the high spaces of the air. the billowing clouds of mordor were being driven back, their edges tattering as a wind out of the living world came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the dark land of their home. under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light leaked into mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison.
‘look at it, mr. frodo!’ said sam. ‘look at it! the wind’s changed. something’s happening. he’s not having it all his own way. his darkness is breaking up out in the world there. i wish i could see what is going on!’
it was the morning of the fifteenth of march, and over the vale of anduin the sun was rising above the eastern shadow, and the south-west wind was blowing. théoden lay dying on the pelennor fields.
as frodo and sam stood and gazed, the rim of light spread all along the line of the ephel dúath, and then

, moving at a great speed out of the west, at first only a black speck against the glimmering strip above the mountain-tops, but growing, until it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy and passed high above them. as it went it sent out a long shrill cry, the voice of a nazgûl; but this cry no longer held any terror for them: it was a cry of woe and dismay, ill tidings for the dark tower. the lord of the ring-wraiths had met his doom.
‘what did i tell you? something’s happening!’ cried sam.’ “the war’s going well,” said shagrat; but gorbag he wasn’t so sure. and he was right there too. things are looking up, mr. frodo. haven’t you got some hope now?’
‘well no, not much, sam,’ frodo sighed. ‘that’s away beyond the mountains. we’re going east not west. and i’m so tired. and the ring is so heavy, sam. and i begin to see it in my mind all the time, like a great wheel of fire.’
sam’s quick spirits sank again at once. he looked at his master anxiously, and

 he took his hand. ‘come, mr. frodo!’ he said. ‘i’ve got one thing i wanted: a bit of light. enough to help us, and yet i guess it’s dangerous too. try a bit further, and then we’ll lie close and have a rest. but take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the elves’ food; it may hearten you.’
sharing a wafer of lembas, and munching it as best they could with their parched mouths. frodo and sam plodded on. the light, though no more than a grey dusk, was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the valley between the mountains. it sloped up gently northward, and at its bottom went the bed of a now dry and withered stream. beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path that wound its way under the feet of the westward cliffs. had they known, they could have reached it quicker, for it was a track that left the main morgul-road at the western bridge-end and went down by a long st

able. water trickling. out of a gully on the left, so sharp and narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had been cloven by some huge axe, water came dripping down: the last remains, maybe, of some sweet rain gathered from sunlit seas, but ill-fated to fall at last upon the walls of the black land and wander fruitless down into the dust. here it came out of the rock in a little falling streamlet, and flowed across the path, and turning south ran away swiftly to be lost among the dead stones.
sam sprang towards it. ‘if ever i see the lady again, i will tell her!’ he cried. ‘light and now water!’ then he stopped. ‘let me drink first mr. frodo,’ he said.
‘all right, but there’s room enough for two.’
‘i didn’t mean that,’ said sam. ‘i mean: if it’s poisonous, or something that will show its badness quick, well, better me than you, master, if you understand me.’
‘i do. but i think we’ll trust our luck together, sam; or our blessing. still, be careful now, i

the water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste, at once bitter and oily, or so they would have said at home. here it seemed beyond all praise, and beyond fear or prudence. they drank their fill, and sam replenished his water-bottle. after that frodo felt easier, and they went on for several miles, until the broadening of the road and the beginnings of a rough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another orc-hold.
‘this is where we turn aside, sam,’ said frodo. ‘and we must turn east.’ he sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley. ‘i have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there. and then i must rest a little.’

ses crawled on them; and everywhere great writhing, tangled brambles sprawled. some had long stabbing thorns, some hooked barbs that rent like knives. the sullen shrivelled leaves of a past year hung on them, grating and rattling in the sad airs, but their maggot-ridden buds were only just opening. flies, dun or grey, or black, marked like ores with a red eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and stung; and above the briar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled.
‘orc-gear’s no good,’ said sam, waving his arms. ‘i wish i’d got an orc’s hide!’
at last frodo could go no further. they had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine, but they still had a long way to go before they could even come in sight of the last craggy ridge. ‘i must rest now, sam, and sleep if i can.’ said frodo. he looked about, but there seemed nowhere even for an animal to crawl into in this dismal country. at length, tired out, they slunk under a curtain of brambles that hung down like a mat over a low rock

there they sat and made such a meal as they could. keeping back the precious lembas for the evil days ahead, they ate the half of what remained in sam’s bag of faramir’s provision: some dried fruit, and a small slip of cured meat; and they sipped some water. they had drunk again from the pools in the valley, but they were very, thirsty again. there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dried the mouth. when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed. beyond the morgai there was the dreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross.
‘now you go to sleep first, mr. frodo,’ he said. ‘it’s getting dark again. i reckon this day is nearly over.’
frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken. sam struggled with his own weariness, and he took frodo’s hand; and there he sat silent till deep night fell. then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled from the hiding-place and looked o

wled back into the brambles and laid himself by frodo’s side, and putting away all fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep.
they woke together, hand in hand. sam was almost fresh, ready for another day; but frodo sighed. his sleep had been uneasy, full of dreams of fire, and waking brought him no comfort. still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able to bear his burden one stage further. they did not know the time, nor how long they had slept; but after a morsel of food and a sip of water they went on up the ravine, until it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones. there the last living things gave up th

t. behind it there hung a vast shadow, ominous as a thunder-cloud, the veils of barad-dûr that was reared far way upon a long spur of the ashen mountains thrust down from the north. the dark power was deep in thought, and the eye turned inward, pondering tidings of doubt and danger: a bright sword, and a stern and kingly face it saw, and for a while it gave little thought to other things; and all its great stronghold, gate on gate, and tower on tower, was wrapped in a brooding gloom.
frodo and sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful land. between them and the smoking mountain, and about it north and south, all seemed ruinous and dead, a desert burned and choked. they wondered how the lord of this realm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies. yet armies he had. as far as their eyes could reach, along the skirts of the morgai and away southward, there were camps, some of tents, some ordered like small towns. one of the largest of these was right below them. barel

y a mile out into the plain it clustered like some huge nest of insects, with straight dreary streets of huts and long low drab buildings. about it the ground was busy with folk going to and fro; a wide road ran from it south-east to join the morgul-way, and along it many lines of small black shapes were hurrying.
‘i don’t like the look of things at all,’ said sam. ‘pretty hopeless, i call it - saving that where there’s such a lot of folk there must be wells or water, not to mention food. and these are men not orcs, or my eyes are all wrong.’
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great slave-worked fields away south in this wide realm, beyond the fumes of the mountain by the dark sad waters of lake núrnen; nor of the great roads that ran away east and south to tributary lands, from which the soldiers of the tower brought long waggon-trains of

 and the musterings of long-planned war; and here the dark power, moving its armies like pieces on the board, was gathering them together. its first moves, the first feelers of its strength, had been checked upon its western line, southward and northward. for the moment it withdrew them, and brought up new forces, massing them about cirith gorgor for an avenging stroke. and if it had also been its purpose to defend the mountain against all approach, it could scarcely have done more.
‘well!’ sam went on. ‘whatever they have to eat and drink, we can’t get it. there’s no way down that i can see. and we couldn’t cross all that open country crawling with enemies, even if we did get down.’
‘still we shall have to try,’ said frodo. ‘it’s no worse than i expected. i never hoped to get across. i can’t see any hope of it now. but i’ve still got to do the best i can. at present that is to avoid being captured as long as possible. so we must still go northwards, i think, and

‘i guess what it’ll be like,’ said sam. ‘where it’s narrower the orcs and men will just be packed closer. you’ll see, mr. frodo.’
‘i dare say i shall, if we ever get so far,’ said frodo and turned away.
they soon found that it was impossible to make their way along the crest of the morgai, or anywhere along its higher levels, pathless as they were and scored with deep ghylls. in the end they were forced to go back down the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley. it was rough going, for they dare

the big orc, spear in hand, leapt after him. but the tracker, springing behind a stone, put an arrow in his eye as he ran up, and he fell with a crash. the other ran off across the valley and disappeared.
for a while the hobbits sat in silence. at length sam stirred. ‘well i call that neat as neat,’ he said. ‘if this nice friendliness would spread about in mordor, half our trouble would be over.’
‘quietly, sam,’ frodo whispered. ‘there may be others about. we have evidently had a very narrow escape, and the hunt was hotter on our tracks than we guessed. but that is the spirit of mordor, sam; and it has spread to every corner of it. orcs have always behaved like that, or so all tales say, when they are on their own. but you can’t get

 much hope out of it. they hate us far more, altogether and all the time. if those two had seen us, they would have dropped all their quarrel until we were dead.’
there was another long silence. sam broke it again, but with a whisper this time. ‘did you hear what they said about that gobbler, mr. frodo? i told you gollum wasn’t dead yet, didn’t i?’
‘yes, i remember. and i wondered how you knew,’ said frodo. ‘well come now! i think we had better not move out from here again, until it has gone quite dark. so you shall tell me how you know, and all about what happened. if you can do it quietly.’
‘i’ll try,’ said sam, ‘but when i think of that stinker i get so hot l cou

ld shout.’
there the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny bush, while the drear light of mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night; and sam spoke into frodo’s ear all that he could find words for of gollum’s treacherous attack, the horror of shelob, and his own adventures with the orcs. when he had finished, frodo said nothing but took sam’s hand and pressed it. at length he stirred.
‘well, i suppose we must be going on again,’ he said. ‘i wonder how long it will be before we really are caught and all the toiling and the slinking will be over, and in vain.’ he stood up. ‘it’s dark, and we cannot use the lady’s glass. keep it safe for me, sam. i have nowhere to keep it now, except in my hand, and i shall need both hands in the blind night. but sting i give to you. i have got an orc-blade, but i do not think it will

 be my part to strike any blow again.’
it was difficult and dangerous moving in the night in the pathless land; but slowly and with much stumbling the two hobbits toiled on hour by hour northward along the eastern edge of the stony valley. when a grey light crept back over the western heights, long after day had opened in the lands beyond, they went into hiding again and slept a little, turn by turn. in his times of waking sam was busy with thoughts of food. at last when frodo roused himself and spoke of eating and making ready for yet another effort, he asked the question that was troubling him most.
‘begging your pardon, mr. frodo,’ he said, ‘but have you any notion how far there is still to go?’
‘no, not any clear notion, sam,’ frodo answered. ‘in rivendell before i set out i was shown a map of mordor that was made before the enemy came back here; but i only remember it vaguely. i remember clearest t

re was a place in the north where the western range and the northern range send out spurs that nearly meet. that must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge back by the tower. it might be a good point at which to cross. but of course, if we get there, we shall be further than we were from the mountain, sixty miles from it, i should think. i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues north from the bridge now. even if all goes well, i could hardly reach the mountain in a week. i am afraid, sam, that the burden will get very heavy, and i shall go still slower as we get nearer.’
sam sighed. ‘that’s just as i feared,’ he said. ‘well, to say nothing of water, we’ve got to eat less, mr. frodo, or else move a bit quicker, at any rate while we’re still in this valley. one more bite and all the food’s ended, save the elves’ waybread.’
‘i’ll try and be a bit quicker, sam,’ said frodo, drawing a deep breath. ‘come on then! let’s start another march!’

e winding down from it, until only a mile or two from where the hobbits lay it turned east and ran along a shelf cut in the side of the spur, and so went down into the plain, and on to the isenmouthe.
to the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journey north had been useless. the plain to their right was dim and smoky, and they could see there neither camps nor troops moving; but all that region was under the vigilance of the forts of carach angren.
‘we have come to a dead end, sam,’ said frodo. ‘if we go on, we shall only come up to that orc-tower, but the only road to take is that road that comes down from it - unless we go back. we can’t climb up westward, or climb down eastward.’
‘then we must take the road, mr. frodo,’ said sam. ‘we must take it and chance our luck, if there is any luck in mordor. we might as well give ourselves up as wander about any more, or try to go back. our food won’t last. we’ve got to make a dash for it!’
‘all right, sam

,’ said frodo. ‘lead me! as long as you’ve got any hope left. mine is gone. but i can’t dash, sam. i’ll just plod along after you.’
‘before you start any more plodding, you need sleep and food, mr. frodo. come and take what you can get of them!’
he gave frodo water and an additional wafer of the waybread, and he made a pillow of his cloak for his master’s head. frodo was too weary to debate the matter, and sam did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop of their water, and eaten sam’s share of the food as well as his own. when frodo was asleep sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned his face. it was lined and thin, and yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid. ‘well, here goes, master!’ sam muttered to himself. ‘i’ll have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck. water we must have, or we’ll get no further.’
sam crept out, and flitting from stone to stone wit

h more than hobbit-care, he went down to the water-course, and then followed it for some way as it climbed north, until he came to the rock-steps where long ago, no doubt, its spring had come gushing down in a little waterfall. all now seemed dry and silent; but refusing to despair sam stooped and listened, and to his delight he caught the sound of trickling. clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream of dark water that came out from the hill-side and filled a little bare pool, from which again it spilled, and vanished then under the barren stones.
sam tasted the water, and it seemed good enough. then he drank deeply, refilled the bottle, and turned to go back. at that moment he caught a glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near frodo’s hidi

ng-place. biting back a cry, he leapt down from the spring and ran, jumping from stone to stone. it was a wary creature, difficult to see, but sam had little doubt about it: he longed to get his hands on its neck. but it heard him coming and slipped quickly away. sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of it, peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice, before it ducked and disappeared.
‘well, luck did not let me down,’ muttered sam, ‘but that was a near thing! isn’t it enough to have orcs by the thousand without that stinking villain coming nosing round? i wish he had been shot!’ he sat down by frodo and did not rouse him; but he did not dare to go to sleep himself. at last when he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep awake could not go on much longer, he wakened frodo gently.
‘that gollum’s about again, i’m afraid, mr. frodo,’ he said. ‘leastways, if it wasn’t him, then there’s two

 of him. i went away to find some water and spied him nosing round just as i turned back. i reckon it isn’t safe for us both to sleep together, and begging your pardon, but i can’t hold up my lids much longer.’
‘bless you, sam!’ said frodo. ‘lie down and take your proper turn! but i’d rather have gollum than orcs. at any rate he won’t give us away to them - not unless he’s caught himself.’
‘but he might do a bit of robbery and murder on his own,’ growled sam. ‘keep your eyes open, mr. frodo! there’s a bottle full of water. drink up. we can fill it again when we go on.’ with that sam plunged into sleep.
light was fading when he woke. frodo sat propped against the rock behind, but he had fallen asleep. the water-bottle was empty. there was no sign of gollum.
mordor-dark had returned, and the watch-fires on the heights burned fierce and red, when the hobbits set out again on the most dangerous stage of all their journey. they went first to the l

screened from sight. this proved disastrous. they rested for some minutes and then went on; but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in the stillness of the night they heard the sound that all along they had secretly dreaded: the noise of marching feet. it was still some way behind them, but looking back they could see the twinkle of torches coming round the bend less than a mile away, and they were moving fast: too fast for frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead.
‘i feared it, sam,’ said frodo. ‘we’ve trusted to luck, and it has failed us. we’re trapped.’ he looked wildly up at the frowning wall, where the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their heads. he ran to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of gloom. ‘we’re trapped at last!’ he said he sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowed his head.
‘seems so,’ said sam. ‘well, we can but wait and see.’ and with that he sat down beside fr

they did not have to wait long. the orcs were going at a great pace. those in the foremost files bore torches. on they came, red flames in the dark, swiftly growing. now sam too bowed his head, hoping that it would hide his face when the torches reached them; and he set their shields before their knees to hide their feet.
‘if only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers alone and pass on!’ he thought.
and so it seemed that they would. the leading orcs came loping along, panting, holding their heads down. they were a gang of the smaller breeds being driven unwilling to their dark lord’s wars; all they cared for was to get the march over and

 escape the whip. beside them, running up and down the line, went two of the large fierce uruks, cracking lashes and shouting. file after file passed, and the tell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead. sam held his breath. now more than half the line had gone by. then suddenly one of the slave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side. he flicked a whip at them and yelled: ‘hi, you! get up!’ they did not answer, and with a shout he halted the whole company.
‘come on, you slugs!’ he cried. ‘this is no time for slouching.’ he took a step towards them, and even in the gloom he recognized the devices on their shields. ‘deserting, eh?’ he snarled. ‘or thinking of it? all your fo

 get and fall in, or i’ll have your numbers and report you.’
they struggled to their feet, and keeping bent, limping like footsore soldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear of the line. ‘no, not at the rear!’ the slave-driver shouted. ‘three files up. and stay there, or you’ll know it, when i come down the line!’ he sent his long whip-lash cracking over their heads; then with another crack and a yell he started the company off again at a brisk trot.
it was hard enough for poor sam, tired as he was; but for frodo it was a torment, and soon a nightmare. he set his teeth and tried to stop his mind from thinking, and he struggled on. the stench of the sweating orcs about him was stifling, and he began to gasp with thirst. on, on they went, and he bent all his will to draw his breath and to make his legs keep going; and yet to what evil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think. there was no hope of falling out unseen: now and again the orc-driver fell back and jeere

‘there now!’ he laughed, flicking at their legs. ‘where there’s a whip there’s a will, my slugs. hold up! i’d give you a nice freshener now, only you’ll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to your camp. do you good. don’t you know we’re at war?’
they had gone some miles, and the road was at last running down a long slope into the plain, when frodo’s strength began to give out and his will wavered. he lurched and stumbled. desperately sam tried to help him and hold him up, though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much longer. at any moment now he knew that the end would come: his master would faint or fall, and all would be discovered, and their bitter efforts be in vain. ‘i’ll have that big slave-driving devil anyway,’ he thought.
then just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his sword, there came an unexpected relief. they were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance to udûn. some way i

. so it chanced that several companies came together at the road-meeting, in the dark beyond the light of the watch-fires on the wall. at once there was great jostling and cursing as each troop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of their march. though the drivers yelled and plied their whips, scuffles broke out and some blades were drawn. a troop of heavy-armed uruks from barad-dûr charged into the durthang line and threw them into confusion.
dazed as he was with pain and weariness, sam woke up, grasped quickly at his chance, and threw himself to the ground, dragging frodo down with him. orcs fell over them, snarling and cursing. slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out of the turmoil, until at last unnoticed they dropped over the further edge of the road. it had a high kerb by which troop-leaders could guide themselves in black night or fog, and it was banked up some feet above the level of the open land.

‘come on, mr. frodo!’ he whispered. ‘one more crawl, and then you can lie still.’
with a last despairing effort frodo raised himself on his hands, and struggled on for maybe twenty yards. then he pitched down into a shallow pit that opened unexpectedly before them, and there he lay like a dead thing.

mount doom

sam put his ragged orc-cloak under his master’s head, and covered them both with the grey robe of lórien; and as he did so his thoughts went out to that fair land, and to the elves, and he hoped that the cloth woven by their hands might have some virtue to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this wilderness of fear. he heard the scuffling and cries die down as the troops passed on through the isenmouthe. it seemed that in the confusion and the mingling of many companies of various kinds they had

sam took a sip of water, but pressed frodo to drink, and when his master had recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybread and made him eat it. then, too worn out even to feel much fear, they stretched themselves out. they slept a little in uneasy fits; for their sweat grew chill on them, and the hard stones bit them, and they shivered. out of the north from the black gate through cirith gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a thin cold air.

 light came again, for in the high regions the west wind still blew, but down on the stones behind the fences of the black land the air seemed almost dead, chill and yet stifling. sam looked up out of the hollow. the land all about was dreary, flat and drab-hued. on the roads nearby nothing was moving now; but sam feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe, no more than a furlong away northward. south-eastward, far off like a dark standing shadow. loomed the mountain. smokes were pouring from it and while those that rose into the upper air trailed away eastward, great rolling clouds floated down its sides and spread over the land. a few miles to the north-east the foothills of the ashen mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts, behind which the misty northern heights rose like a line of distan

sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to take. it looks every step of fifty miles,’ he muttered gloomily staring at the threatening mountain, ‘and that’ll take a week, if it takes a day, with mr. frodo as he is.’ he shook his head, and as he worked things out, slowly a new dark thought grew in his mind. never for long had hope died in his staunch heart, and always until now he had taken some thought for their return. but the bitter truth came home to him at last

: at best their provision would take them to their goal; and when the task was done, there they would come to an end, alone, houseless, foodless in the midst of a terrible desert. there could be no return.
‘so that was the job i felt i had to do when i started,’ thought sam: ‘to help mr. frodo to the last step and then die with him? well, if that is the job then i must do it. but i would dearly like to see bywater again, and rosie cotton and her brothers, and the gaffer and marigold and all. i can’t think somehow that gandalf would have sent mr. frodo on this errand if there hadn’t a’ been any hope of his ever coming back at all. things all went wrong when he went down in moria. i wish he hadn’t. he would have done something.’

with a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes back to the ground near at hand, studying the next move. as the light grew a little he saw to his surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and featureless flats were in fact all bro

of soft mud, it had been smitten with a shower of bolts and huge slingstones. the largest of these holes were rimmed with ridges of broken rock, and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions. it was a land in which it would be possible to creep from hiding to hiding, unseen by all but the most watchful eyes: possible at least for one who was strong and had no need for speed. for the hungry and worn, who had far to go before life failed, it had an evil look.
thinking of all these things sam went back to his master. he had no need to rouse him. frodo was lying on his back with eyes open, staring at the cloudy sky. ‘well, mr. frodo,’ said sam, ‘i’ve been having a look round and thinking a bit. there’s nothing on the roads, and we’d best be getting away while there’s a chance. can you manage it?’
‘i can manage it,’ said frodo. ‘i must.’
once more they started, crawling from hollow to hollow, flitting behind such cover as they could find, but moving always in a

the hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted. frodo seemed nearly spent. sam saw that he could not go much further in this fashion, crawling, stooping, now picking a doubtful way very slowly, now hurrying at a stumbling run.
‘i’m going back on to the road while the light lasts, mr. frodo,’ he said. ‘trust to luck again! it nearly failed us last time, but it didn’t quite. a steady pace for a few more miles, and then a rest.’
he was taking a far greater risk than he knew; but frodo was too much occupied with his burden and with the struggle in his mind to deba

ker, like the oncoming of a wall of night at the last end of the world.
there came at last a dreadful nightfall; and even as the captains of the west drew near to the end of the living lands, the two wanderers came to an hour of blank despair. four days had passed since they had escaped from the orcs, but the time lay behind them like an ever-darkening dream. all this last day frodo had not spoken, but had walked half-bowed, often stumbling, as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet. sam guessed that among all their pains he bore the worst, the growing weight of the ring, a burden on the body and a torment to his mind. anxiously sam had noted how his master’s left hand would often be raised as if to ward on a blow, or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful eye that sought to look in them. and sometimes his right hand would creep to his breast, clutching, and then slowly, as the will recovered mastery, it would be withdrawn.

on their right, almost due south, and they must turn towards it. yet still before it there stretched a wide region of fuming, barren, ash-ridden land.
‘water, water!’ muttered sam. he had stinted himself, and in his parched mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen; but for all his care they now had very little left, perhaps half his bottle, and maybe there were still days to go. all would long ago have been spent, if they had not dared to follow the orc-road. for at long intervals on that highway cisterns had been built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterless regions. in one sam had found some water left, stale, muddied by the orcs, but still sufficien

ul night passed slowly and reluctantly. such daylight as followed was dim; for here as the mountain drew near the air was ever mirky, while out from the dark tower there crept the veils of shadow that sauron wove about himself. frodo was lying on his back not moving. sam stood beside him, reluctant to speak, and yet knowing that the word now lay with him: he must set his master’s will to work for another effort. at length, stooping and caressing frodo’s brow, he spoke in his ear.
‘wake up, master!’ he said. ‘time for another start.’
as if roused by a sudden bell, frodo rose quickly, and stood up and looked away southwards; but when his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he quailed again.
‘i can’t manage it, sam,’ he said. ‘it is such a

weight to carry, such a weight.’
sam knew before he spoke, that it was vain, and that such words might do more harm than good, but in his pity he could not keep silent. ‘then let me carry it a bit for you, master,’ he said. ‘you know i would, and gladly, as long as i have any strength.’
a wild light came into frodo’s eyes. ‘stand away! don’t touch me!’ he cried. ‘it is mine, i say. be off!’ his hand strayed to his sword-hilt. but then quickly his voice changed. ‘no, no, sam,’ he said sadly. ‘but you must understand. it is my burden, and no one else can bear it. it is too late now, sam dear. you can’t help me in that way again. i am almost in its power now. i could not give it up, and if you tried to take it i should go mad.’
sam nodded. ‘i understand,’ he said. ‘but i’ve been thinking, mr. frodo, there’s other things we might do without. why not lighten the load a bit? we’re going that way now, as straight as we can make it.’ he pointed to th

do looked again towards the mountain. ‘no,’ he said, ‘we shan’t need much on that road. and at its end nothing.’ picking up his orc-shield he flung it away and threw his helmet after it. then pulling off the grey cloak he undid the heavy belt and let it fall to the ground, and the sheathed sword with it. the shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered.
‘there, i’ll be an orc no more,’ he cried, ‘and i’ll bear no weapon fair or foul. let them take me, if they will!’
sam did likewise, and put aside his orc-gear; and he took out all the things in his pack. somehow each of them had become dear to him, if only because he had borne them so far with so much toil. hardest of all it was to part with his cooking-gear. tears welled in his eyes at the thought of casting it away.
‘do you remember that bit of rabbit, mr. frodo?’ he said. ‘and our place under the warm bank in captain faramir’s country, the day i saw an oliphaunt?’

sam went to him and kissed his hand. ‘then the sooner we’re rid of it, the sooner to rest,’ he said haltingly, finding no better words to say. ‘talking won’t mend nothing,’ he muttered to himself, as he gathered up all the things that they had chosen to cast away. he was not willing to leave them lying open in the wilderness for any eyes to see. ‘stinker picked up that orc-shirt, seemingly, and he isn’t going to add a sword to it. his hands are bad enough when empty. and he isn’t

ss of its dreary day few things even in that land of vigilance could have espied them, save from close at hand. of all the slaves of the dark lord, only the nazgûl could have warned him of the peril that crept, small but indomitable, into the very heart of his guarded realm. but the nazgûl and their black wings were abroad on another errand: they were gathered far away, shadowing the march of the captains of the west, and thither the thought of the dark tower was turned.
that day it seemed to sam that his master had found some new strength, more than could be explained by the small lightening of the load that he had to carry. in the first marches they went further and faster than he had hoped. the land was rough and hostile, and yet they made much progress, and ever the mountain drew nearer. but as the day wore on and all too soon the dim light began to fail, frodo stooped again, and began to stagger, as if the renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength.

he could not sleep and he held a debate with himself. ‘well, come now, we’ve done better than you hoped,’ he said sturdily. ‘began well anyway. i reckon we crossed half the distance before we stopped. one more day will do it.’ and then he paused.
‘don’t be a fool, sam gamgee,’ came an answer in his own voice. ‘he won’t go another day like that, if he moves at all. and you can’t go on much longer giving him all the water and most of the food.’
‘i can go on a good way though, and i will.’
‘where to?’
‘to the mountain, of course.’
‘but what then, sam gamgee, what then? when you get there, what are you going to do? he won’t be able to do anything for himself.’
to his dismay sam realized that he had not got an answer to this. he had no

 clear idea at all. frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand, and sam only knew vaguely that the ring had somehow to be put into the fire. ‘the cracks of doom,’ he muttered, the old name rising to his mind. ‘well, if master knows how to find them, i don’t.’
‘there you are!’ came the answer. ‘it’s all quite useless. he said so himself. you are the fool, going on hoping and toiling. you could have lain down and gone to sleep together days ago, if you hadn’t been so dogged. but you’ll die just the same, or worse. you might just as well lie down

 now and give it up. you’ll never get to the top anyway.’
‘i’ll get there, if i leave everything but my bones behind,’ said sam. ‘and i’ll carry mr. frodo up myself, if it breaks my back and heart. so stop arguing!’
at that moment sam felt a tremor in the ground beneath him, and he heard or sensed a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the earth. there was a brief red flame that flickered under the clouds and died away. the mountain too slept uneasily.
the last stage of their journey to orodruin came, and it was a torment greater than sam had ever thought that he could bear. he was in pain, and so parched that he could no longer swallow even a mouthful of food. it remained dark, not only because of the smokes of

ess came on them, so that they staggered and often fell. and yet their wills did not yield, and they struggled on.
the mountain crept up ever nearer, until, if they lifted their heavy heads, it filled all their sight, looming vast before them: a huge mass of ash and slag and burned stone, out of which a sheer-sided cone was raised into the clouds. before the daylong dusk ended and true night came again they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet.
with a gasp frodo cast himself on the ground. sam sat by him. to his surprise he felt tired but lighter, and his head seemed clear again. no more debates disturbed his mind. he knew all the arguments of despair and would not listen to them. his will was set, and only death would break it. he felt no longer either desire or need of sleep, but rather of watchfulness. he knew that all the hazards and perils were now drawing together to a point: the next day would be a day of doom, the day of final effort or disaster, the last gasp.
but when would

 it come? the night seemed endless and timeless, minute after minute falling dead and adding up to no passing hour, bringing no change. sam began to wonder if a second darkness had begun and no day would ever reappear. at last he groped for frodo’s hand. it was cold and trembling. his master was shivering.
‘i didn’t ought to have left my blanket behind,’ muttered sam; and lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his arms and body. then sleep took him, and the dim light of the last day of their quest found them side by side. the wind had fallen the day before as it shifted from the west, and now it came from the north and began to rise; and slowly the light of the unseen sun filtered down into the shadows where the hobbits lay.
‘now for it! now for the last gasp!’ said sam as he struggled to his feet. he bent over frodo, rousing him gently. frodo groane

d; but with a great effort of will he staggered up; and then he fell upon his knees again. he raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes of mount doom towering above him, and then pitifully he began to crawl forward on his hands.
sam looked at him and wept in his heart, but no tears came to his dry and stinging eyes. ‘i said i’d carry him, if it broke my back,’ he muttered, ‘and i will!’
‘come, mr. frodo!’ he cried. ‘i can’t carry it for you, but i can carry you and it as well. so up you get! come on, mr. frodo dear! sam will give you a ride. just tell him where to go, and he’ll go.’
as frodo clung upon his back, arms loosely about his neck, legs clasped firmly under his arms, sam staggered to his feet

; and then to his amazement he felt the burden light. he had feared that he would have barely strength to lift his master alone, and beyond that he had expected to share in the dreadful dragging weight of the accursed ring. but it was not so. whether because frodo was so worn by his long pains, wound of knife, and venomous sting, and sorrow, fear, and homeless wandering, or because some gift of final strength was given to him, sam lifted frodo with no more difficulty than if he were carrying a hobbit-child pig-a-back in some romp on the lawns or hayfields of the shire. he took a deep breath and started off.
they had reached the mountain’s foot on its northern side, and a little to the westward; there its long grey slopes, though broken, were not sheer. frodo did not speak, and so sam struggled on as best he could, having no guidance but the will to climb as high as might be before his strength gave out and his will bro

ke. on he toiled, up and up, turning this way and that to lessen the slope, often stumbling forward, and at the last crawling like a snail with a heavy burden on its back. when his will could drive him no further, and his limbs gave way, he stopped and laid his master gently down.
frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath. it was easier to breathe up here above the reeks that coiled and drifted down below. ‘thank you, sam,’ he said in a cracked whisper. ‘how far is there to go?’
‘i don’t know,’ said sam, ‘because i don’t know where we’re going.’
he looked back, and then he looked up; and he was amazed to see how far his last effort had brought him. the mountain standing ominous and alone had looked taller than it was. sam saw now that it was less lofty than the high passes of the ephel dúath which he and frodo had scaled. the confused and tumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe th

ree thousand feet above the plain, and above them was reared half as high again its tall central cone, like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater. but already sam was more than half way up the base, and the plain of gorgoroth was dim below him, wrapped in fume and shadow. as he looked up he would have given a shout. if his parched throat had allowed him; for amid the rugged humps and shoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road. it climbed like a rising girdle from the west and wound snakelike about the mountain, until before it went round out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern side.
sam could not see the course immediately abo

ve him, where it was lowest, for a steep slope went up from where he stood; but he guessed that if he could only struggle on just a little way further up, they would strike this path. a gleam of hope returned to him. they might conquer the mountain yet. ‘why, it might have been put there a-purpose!’ he said to himself. ‘if it wasn’t there, i’d have to say i was beaten in the end.’
the path was not put there for the purposes of sam. he did not know it, but he was looking at sauron’s road from barad-dûr to the sammath naur, the chambers of fire. out from the dark tower’s huge western gate it came over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron, and then passing into the plain it ran for a league between two smoking chasms, and so reached a long sloping causeway that led up on to the mountain’s eastern side. thence, turning and encircling all its wide girth from south to north, it climbed at last, high in the upper cone,

but still far from the reeking summit, to a dark entrance that gazed back east straight to the window of the eye in sauron’s shadow-mantled fortress. often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the mountain’s furnaces, always that road was repaired and cleaned again by the labours of countless orcs.
sam drew a deep breath. there was a path, but how he was to get up the slope to it he did not know. first he must ease his aching back. he lay flat beside frodo for a while. neither spoke. slowly the light grew. suddenly a sense of urgency which he did not understand came to sam. it was almost as if he had been called: ‘now, now, or it will be too late!’ he braced himself and got up. frodo also seemed to have felt the call. he struggled to his knees.
‘i’ll crawl, sam,’ he gasped.

ared out, but as from some great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing eye; and then the shadows were furled again and the terrible vision was removed. the eye was not turned to them: it was gazing north to where the captains of the west stood at bay, and thither all its malice was now bent, as the power moved to strike its deadly blow; but frodo at that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally. his hand sought the chain about his neck.
sam knelt by him. faint, almost inaudibly, he heard frodo whispering: ‘help me, sam! help me, sam! hold my hand! i can’t stop it.’ sam took his master’s hands and laid them together, palm to palm, and kissed them; and then he held them gently between his own. the thought came suddenly to him: ‘he’s spotted us! it’s all up, or it soon will be. now, sam gamgee, this is the end of ends.’
again he lifted frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast. letting his master’s legs dangle

. then he bowed his head and struggled off along the climbing road. it was not as easy a way to take as it had looked at first. by fortune the fires that had poured forth in the great turmoils when sam stood upon cirith ungol had flowed down mainly on the southern and western slopes, and the road on this side was not blocked. yet in many places it had crumbled away or was crossed by gaping rents. after climbing eastward for some time it bent back upon itself at a sharp angle and went westward fox a space. there at the bend it was cut deep through a crag of old weathered stone once long ago vomited from the mountain’s furnaces. panting under his load sam turned the bend; and even as he did s

he crag, like a small piece of black stone that had toppled off as he passed.
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward, tearing the backs of his hands that still clasped his master’s. then he knew what had happened, for above him as he lay he heard a hated voice.
‘wicked masster!’ it hissed. ‘wicked masster cheats us; cheats sméagol, gollum. he musstn’t go that way. he musstn’t hurt preciouss. give it to sméagol, yess, give it to us! give it to uss!’
with a violent heave sam rose up. at once he drew his sword; but he could do nothing. gollum and frodo were locked together. gollum was tearing at his master, trying to get at the chain and the ring. this was probably the only thing that could have roused the dying embers of frodo’s heart and will: an attack, an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force. he fought back with a sudden fury that amazed sam, and gollum also. even so things might have gone far otherwise, if gollum himself had remained unchanged; but

, haggard thing, all bones and tight-drawn sallow skin. a wild light flamed in his eyes, but his malice was no longer matched by his old griping strength. frodo flung him off and rose up quivering.
‘down, down!’ he gasped, clutching his hand to his breast, so that beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the ring. ‘down you creeping thing, and out of my path! your time is at an end. you cannot betray me or slay me now.’
then suddenly, as before under the eaves of the emyn muil, sam saw these two rivals with other vision. a crouching shape, scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of fire. out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice.
‘begone, and trouble me no more! if you touch me ever again, you shall be cast yourself into the fire of doom.’
the crouching shape bac

ked away, terror in its blinking eyes, and yet at the same time insatiable desire.
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing, hand on breast, his breath coming in great gasps, and gollum at his feet, resting on his knees with his wide-splayed hands upon the ground.
‘look out!’ cried sam. ‘he’ll spring!’ he stepped forward, brandishing his sword. ‘quick, master!’ he gasped. ‘go on! go on! no time to lose. i’ll deal with him. go on!’
frodo looked at him as if at one now far away. ‘yes, i must go on,’ he said. ‘farewell, sam! this is the end at last. on mount doom doom shall fall. farewell!’ he turned and went on, walking slowly but erect up the climbing path.
‘now!’ said sam. ‘at last i can deal with you!’ he leaped forward with drawn blade ready

for battle. but gollum did not spring. he fell flat upon the ground and whimpered.
‘don’t kill us,’ he wept. ‘don’t hurt us with nassty cruel steel! let us live, yes, live just a little longer. lost lost! we’re lost. and when precious goes we’ll die, yes, die into the dust.’ he clawed up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers. ‘dusst!’ he hissed.
sam’s hand wavered. his mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil. it would be just to slay this treacherous, murderous creature, just and many times deserved; and also it seemed the only safe thing to do. but deep in his heart there was something that restrained him: he could not strike this thing lying in the dust, forlorn, ruinous, utterly wretched. he himself, though only for a little while, had borne the ring, and now dimly he guessed the agony of gollum’s shrivelled mind and body, en

slaved to that ring, unable to find peace or relief ever in life again. but sam had no words to express what he felt.
‘oh, curse you, you stinking thing!’ he said. ‘go away! be off! i don’t trust you, not as far as i could kick you; but be off. or i shall hurt you, yes, with nasty cruel steel.’
gollum got up on all fours, and backed away for several paces, and then he turned, and as sam aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path. sam gave no more heed to him. he suddenly remembered his master. he looked up the path and could not see him. as fast as he could he trudged up the road. if he had looked back, he might have seen not far below gollum turn again, and then with a wild light of madness glaring in his eyes come, swiftly but warily, creeping on behind, a slinking shadow among the stones.
the path climbed on. soon it bent again and. with a last eastward course passed in a cutting along the face of the cone and came to th

e dark door in the mountain’s side, the door of the sammath naur. far away now rising towards the south the sun, piercing the smokes and haze, burned ominous, a dull bleared disc of red; but all mordor lay about the mountain like a dead land, silent, shadow-folded, waiting for some dreadful stroke.
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in. it was dark and hot, and a deep rumbling shook the air. ‘frodo! master!’ he called. there was no answer. for a moment he stood, his heart beating with wild fears, and then he plunged in. a shadow followed him.
at first he could see nothing. in his great need he drew out once more the phial of galadriel, but it was pale and cold in his trembling hand and threw no light into that stifling dark. he was come to the heart of the realm of sauron and the for

ges of his ancient might, greatest in middle-earth; all other powers were here subdued. fearfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark, and then all at once there came a flash of red that leaped upward, and smote the high black roof. then sam saw that he was in a long cave or tunnel that bored into the mountain’s smoking cone. but only a short way ahead its floor and the walls on either side were cloven by a great fissure, out of which the red glare came, now leaping up, now dying down into darkness; and all the while far below there was a rumour and a trouble as of great engines throbbing and labouring.
the light sprang up again, and there on the brink of the chasm, at the very crack of doom, stood frodo, black against the glare,

 tense, erect, but still as if he had been turned to stone.
‘master!’ cried sam.
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice, indeed with a voice clearer and more powerful than sam had ever heard him use, and it rose above the throb and turmoil of mount doom, ringing in the roof and walls.
‘i have come,’ he said. ‘but i do not choose now to do what i came to do. i will not do this deed. the ring is mine!’ and suddenly, as he set it on his finger, he vanished from sam’s sight. sam gasped, but he had no chance to cry out, for at that moment many things happened.
something struck sam violently in the back, his legs were knocked from under him and he was flung aside, striking his head against the stony floor, as a dark shape sprang over him. he lay still and for a moment all went black.
and far away, as frodo put on the ring and claimed it for his own, even in sammath naur the very heart of his realm, the power in barad-dûr was shaken, and the tower trembled from its found

ee; and throughout his realm a tremor ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies halted, and his captains suddenly steerless, bereft of will, wavered and despaired. for they were forgotten. the whole mind and purpose of the power that wielded them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the mountain. at his summons, wheeling with a rending cry, in a last desperate race there flew, faster than the winds, the nazgûl the ringwraiths, and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to mount doom.
sam got up. he was dazed, and blood streaming from his head dripped in his eyes. he groped forward, and then he saw a strange and terrible thing. gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen foe. to and fro he swayed, now so near the brink that almost he tumbled in, now dragging back, falling to the ground, rising, and falling again. and all the while he hissed but spoke no words.
the fires below awoke in anger, the red light blazed, and all the cavern was filled wit

h a great glare and heat. suddenly sam saw gollum’s long hands draw upwards to his mouth; his white fangs gleamed, and then snapped as they bit. frodo gave a cry, and there he was, fallen upon his knees at the chasm’s edge. but gollum, dancing like a mad thing, held aloft the ring, a finger still thrust within its circle. it shone now as if verily it was wrought of living fire.
‘precious, precious, precious!’ gollum cried. ‘my precious! o my precious!’ and with that, even as his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his prize,

 he stepped too far, toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and then with a shriek he fell. out of the depths came his last wail precious, and he was gone.
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise. fires leaped up and licked the roof. the throbbing grew to a great tumult, and the mountain shook. sam ran to frodo and picked him up and carried him. out to the door. and there upon the dark threshold of the sammath naur, high above the plains of mordor, such wonder and terror came on him that he stood still forgetting all else, and gazed as one turned to stone.
a brief vision he had of swirling cloud, and in the midst of it towers and battlements, tall as hills, founded upon a mighty mountain-throne above immeasurable pits; great courts and dungeons, eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs, and gaping gates of steel and adamant: and then all passed. towers fell and mountains slid; walls crumbled and melted, c

to a deafening crash and roar; the earth shook, the plain heaved and cracked, and orodruin reeled. fire belched from its riven summit. the skies burst into thunder seared with lightning. down like lashing whips fell a torrent of black rain. and into the heart of the storm, with a cry that pierced all other sounds, tearing the clouds asunder, the nazgûl came, shooting like flaming bolts, as caught in the fiery ruin of hill and sky they crackled, withered, and went out.
‘well, this is the end, sam gamgee,’ said a voice by his side. and there was frodo, pale and worn, and yet himself again; and in his eyes there was peace now, neither strain of will, nor madness, nor any fear. his burden was taken away. there was the dear master of the sweet days in the shire.
‘master!’ cried sam. and fell upon his knees. in all that ruin of the world for the moment he felt only joy, great joy. the burden was gone. his master had been saved; he was himself again, he was free. and then sam caught sig

‘your poor hand!’ he said. ‘and i have nothing to bind it with, or comfort it. i would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather. but he’s gone now beyond recall, gone for ever.’
‘yes,’ said frodo. ‘but do you remember gandalf’s words: even gollum may have something yet to do? but for him, sam, i could not have destroyed the ring. the quest would have been in vain, even at the bitter end. so let us forgive him! for the quest is achieved, and now all is over. i am glad you are here with me. here at the end of all things, sam.’

‘the north wind blows, but we shall outfly it,’ said gwaihir. and he lifted up gandalf and sped away south, and with him went landroval, and meneldor young and swift. and they passed over udûn and gorgoroth and saw all the land in ruin and tumult beneath them, and before them mount doom blazing, pouring out its fire.
‘i am glad that you are here with me,’ said frodo. ‘here at the end of all things, sam.’
‘yes, i am with you, master,’ said sam, laying frodo’s wounded hand gently to his breast. ‘and you’re with me. and the journey’s finished. but after coming all that way i don’t want to give up yet. it’s not like me, somehow, if you understand.’
‘maybe not, sam,’ said frodo; ‘but it’s like things are in the world. hopes fail. an end comes. we have only a little time to wait now. we are lost in ruin and downfall, and there is no escape.’
‘well, master, we could a

‘very well, sam. if you wish to go, i’ll come,’ said frodo; and they rose and went slowly down the winding road; and even as they passed towards the mountain’s quaking feet, a great smoke and steam belched from the sammath naur, and the side of the cone was riven open, and a huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain-side.
frodo and sam could go no further. their last strength of mind and body was swiftly ebbing. they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the mountain’s foot; but from it there was no more escape. it was an island now, not long to endure, amid the torment of orodruin. all about it the earth gaped, and from deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up. behin

d them the mountain was convulsed. great rents opened in its side. slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes towards them. soon they would be engulfed. a rain of hot ash was falling.
they stood now; and sam still holding his master’s hand caressed it. he sighed. ‘what a tale we have been in, mr. frodo, haven’t we?’ he said. ‘i wish i could hear it told! do you think they’ll say: now comes the story of nine-fingered frodo and the ring of doom? and then everyone will hush, like we did, when in rivendell they told us the tale of beren one-hand and the great jewel. i wish i could hear it! and i wonder how it will go on after our part.’
but even while he spoke so, to keep fear away until

e hill, while the world shook under them, and gasped, and rivers of fire drew near. and even as he espied them and came swooping down, he saw them fall, worn out, or choked with fumes and heat, or stricken down by despair at last, hiding their eyes from death.
side by side they lay; and down swept gwaihir, and down came landroval and meneldor the swift; and in a dream, not knowing what fate had befallen them, the wanderers were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire.
when sam awoke, he found that he was lying on some soft bed, but over him gently swayed wide beechen boughs, and through their young leaves sunlight glimmered, green and gold. all the air was full of a sweet mingled scent.
he remembered that smell: the fragrance of ithilien. ‘bless me!’ he mused. ‘how long have i been asleep?’ for the scent had borne him back to the day when he had lit his little fire under the sunny bank; and for a moment all else between was out of waking memory. he stretched

and drew a deep breath. ‘why, what a dream i’ve had!’ he muttered. ‘i am glad to wake!’ he sat up and then he saw that frodo was lying beside him, and slept peacefully, one hand behind his head, and the other resting upon the coverlet. it was the right hand, and the third finger was missing.
full memory flooded back, and sam cried aloud: ‘it wasn’t a dream! then where are we?’
and a voice spoke softly behind: ‘in the land of ithilien, and in the keeping of the king; and he awaits you.’ with that gandalf stood before him, robed in white, his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight. ‘well, master samwise, how do you feel?’ he said.
but sam lay back, and stared with open mouth, and for a moment, between bewilderment and great joy, he could not answer. at last he gasped:

gandalf! i thought you were dead! but then i thought i was dead myself. is everything sad going to come untrue? what’s happened to the world?’
‘a great shadow has departed,’ said gandalf, and then he laughed and the sound was like music, or like water in a parched land; and as he listened the thought came to sam that he had not heard laughter, the pure sound of merriment, for days upon days without count. it fell upon his ears like the echo of all the joys he had ever known. but he himself burst into tears. then, as a sweet rain will pass down a wind of spring and the sun will shine out the clearer, his tears ceased, and his laughter welled up, and laughing he sprang from his bed.
‘how do i feel?’ he cried. ‘well, i don’t know how to say it. i feel, i feel’ - he waved his arms in the air -

i feel like spring after winter, and sun on the leaves; and like trumpets and harps and all the songs i have ever heard!’ he stopped and he turned towards his master. ‘but how’s mr. frodo?’ he said. ‘isn’t it a shame about his poor hand? but i hope he’s all right otherwise. he’s had a cruel time.’
‘yes, i am all right otherwise,’ said frodo, sitting up and laughing in his turn. i fell asleep again waiting for you, sam, you sleepyhead. i was awake early this morning, and now it must be nearly noon.’
‘noon?’ said sam, trying to calculate. ‘noon of what day?’
‘the fourteenth of the new year,’ said gandalf; ‘or if you like, the eighth day of april in the shire reckoning.« but in gondor the new year will always now begin upon the twenty-fifth of march when sauron fell, and when you were brought out of the fire to the king. he has tended you, and now he awaits you. you shall eat and drink with him

. when you are ready i will lead you to him.’
‘the king?’ said sam. ‘what king, and who is he?’
‘the king of gondor and lord of the western lands,’ said gandalf ‘and he has taken back all his ancient realm. he will ride soon to his crowning, but he waits for you.’
‘what shall we wear?’ said sam; for all he could see was the old and tattered clothes that they had journeyed in, lying folded on the ground beside their beds.
‘the clothes that you wore on your way to mordor,’ said gandalf. ‘even the orc-rags that you bore in the black land; frodo, shall be preserved. no silks and linens, nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable. but later i will find some other clothes, perhaps.’
then he held out his hands to them, and they saw that one shone with light. ‘what have you

‘yes, i have brought your two treasures. they were found on sam when you were rescued. the lady galadriel’s gifts: your glass, frodo, and your box, sam. you will be glad to have these safe again.’
when they were washed and clad, and had eaten a light meal, the hobbits followed gandalf. they stepped out of the beech-grove in which they had lain, and passed on to a long green lawn, glowing in sunshine, bordered by stately dark-leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom. behind them they could hear the sound of falling water, and a stream ran down before them between flowering banks, until it came to a greenwood at the lawn’s foot and passed the

lver haze, out of which rose a long wooded isle, and many ships lay by its shores. but on the field where they now stood a great host was drawn up, in ranks and companies glittering in the sun. and as the hobbits approached swords were unsheathed, and spears were shaken, and horns and trumpets sang, and men cried with many voices and in many tongues:
‘long live the halflings! praise them with great praise!
cuio i pheriain anann! aglar’ni pheriannath!
praise them with great praise, frodo and samwise!

and so the red blood blushing in their faces and their eyes shining with wonder, frodo and sam went forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host were set three high-seats built of green turves. behind the seat upon the right floated, white on green, a great horse running fr

 swan-prowed faring on the sea; but behind the highest throne in the midst of all a great standard was spread in the breeze, and there a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath a shining crown and seven glittering stars. on the throne sat a mail-clad man, a great sword was laid across his knees, but he wore no helm. as they drew near he rose. and then they knew him, changed as he was, so high and glad of face, kingly, lord of men, dark-haired with eyes of grey.
frodo ran to meet him, and sam followed close behind. ‘well, if that isn’t the crown of all!’ he said. ‘strider, or i’m still asleep!’
‘yes, sam, strider,’ said aragorn. ‘it is a long way, is it not, from bree, where you did not like the look of me? a long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road.’
and then to sam’s surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before them; and taking them by the hand, frodo upon his right and sam upon his left, he led them to the throne, and setting them upo

n it, he turned to the men and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the host, crying:
‘praise them with great praise!’
and when the glad shout had swelled up and died away again, to sam’s final and complete satisfaction and pure joy, a minstrel of gondor stood forth, and knelt, and begged leave to sing. and behold! he said:
‘lo! lords and knights and men of valour unashamed, kings and princes, and fair people of gondor, and riders of rohan, and ye sons of elrond, and dúnedain of the north, and elf and dwarf, and greathearts of the shire, and all free folk of the west, now listen to my lay. for i will sing to you of frodo of the nine fingers and the ring of doom.’

en sam heard that he laughed aloud for sheer delight, and he stood up and cried: ‘o great glory and splendour! and all my wishes have come true!’ and then he wept.
and all the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their merriment and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all men were hushed. and he sang to them, now in the elven-tongue, now in the speech of the west, until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords, and the

and at the last, as the sun fell from the noon and the shadows of the trees lengthened, he ended. ‘praise them with great praise!’ he said and knelt. and then aragorn stood up, and all the host arose, and they passed to pavilions made ready, to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted.
frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a tent, and there their old raiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour; and clean linen was given to them. then gandalf came and in his arms, to the wonder of frodo, he bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had been taken from him in mordor. for sam he brought a coat of gilded mail, and his elven-cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that it had suffered; and then he laid before them two swords.
‘i do not wish for any swo

‘tonight at least you should wear one,’ said gandalf.
then frodo took the small sword that had belonged to sam, and had been laid at his side in cirith ungol. ‘sting i gave to you sam,’ he said.
‘no, master! mr. bilbo gave it to you, and it goes with his silver coat; he would not wish anyone else to wear it now.’
frodo gave way; and gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt and girt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads. and when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the king’s table with gandalf, and king éomer of rohan, and the prince imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also wer

but when, after the standing silence, wine was brought there came in two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in the silver and sable of the guards of minas tirith, and the other in white and green. but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army of mighty men. then suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly, he exclaimed:
‘why, look mr. frodo! look here! well, if it isn’t pippin. mr. peregrin took i should say, and mr. merry! how they have grown! bless me! but i can see there’s more tales to tell than ours.’
‘there are indeed,’ said pippin turning towards him. ‘and we’ll begin telling them, as soon as this feast is ended. in the meantime you can try ganda

at last the glad day ended; and when the sun was gone and the round moon rode slowly above the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves, frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the fragrance of fair ithilien; and they talked deep into the night with merry and pippin and gandalf, and after a while legolas and gimli joined them. there frodo and sam learned much of all that had happened to the company after their fellowship was broken on the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell.

‘that you certainly are not,’ said gimli. ‘but what did i say? mortals cannot go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of

‘ent-draughts?’ said sam. ‘there you go about ents again; but what they are beats me. why, it will take weeks before we get all these things sized up!’
‘weeks indeed,’ said pippin. ‘and then frodo will have to be locked up in a tower in minas tirith and write it all down. otherwise he will forget half of it, and poor old bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed.’
at length gandalf rose. ‘the hands of the king are hands of healing, dear friends,’ he said. ‘but you went to the very brink of death ere he re

and so singing legolas went away down the hill.
then the others also departed, and frodo and sam went to their beds and slept. and in the morning they rose again in hope and peace; and they spent many days in ithilien. for the field of cormallen, where the host was now encamped was near to henneth annûn, and the stream that flowed from its falls could be heard in the night as it rushed down through its rocky gate, and passed through the flowery meads into the tides of anduin by the isle of cair andros. the hobbits wandered here and there visiting again the places that they had passed befo

‘well, one can’t be everywhere at once, i suppose,’ he said. ‘but i missed a lot, seemingly.’
in the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to minas tirith. the weary rested and the hurt were healed. for some had laboured

‘alas, not me, lord!’ she said. ‘shadow lies on me still. look not to me for healing! i am a shieldmaiden and my hand is ungentle. but i thank you for this at least, that i need not keep to my chamber. i will walk abroad by the grace of the steward of the city.’ and she did him a courtesy and walked back to the house. but faramir for a long while walked alone in the garden, and his glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls.

in those days the companions of the ring dwelt together in a fair house with gandalf, and they went to and fro as they wished. and frodo said to gandalf: ‘do you know what this day is that aragorn speaks of? for we are happy here, and i don’t wish to go; but the days are running away, and bilbo is waiting; and the shire is my home.’
‘as for bilbo,’ said gandalf, ‘he is waiting for the same day, and he knows what keeps you. and as for the passing of the days, it is now only may and high summer is not yet in; and though all things may seem changed, as if an age of the world had gone by, yet to the trees and the grass it is less than a year since you set out.’
‘pippin,’ said frodo, ‘didn’t you say that gandalf was less close than of old? he was weary of his labours then, i think. now he is recovering.’
and gandalf said: ‘many folk like to know beforehand what is to be

for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and frodo and samwise rode at aragorn’s side, and gandalf rode upon shadowfax, and pippin rode with the knights of gondor; and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod.
in that riding went also queen arwen, and celeborn and galadriel with their folk, and elrond and his sons; and the princes of dol amroth and of ithilien, and many captains and knights. never had any king of the mark such company upon the road as went with théoden thengel’s son to the land of his home.

‘you can have what i have got left,’ said merry, ‘if you will wait a moment.’ he got down and searched in the bag at his saddle. then he handed to saruman a leather pouch. ‘take what there is,’ he said. ‘you are welcome to it; it came from the flotsam of isengard.’
‘mine, mine, yes and dearly bought!’ cried saruman, clutching at the pouch. ‘this is only a repayment in token; for you took more, i’ll be bound. still, a beggar must be grateful, if a thief returns him even a morsel of his own. well, it will serve you right when you come home, if you find things less good in the southfarthing than you would like. long may your land be short of leaf!’

but at length all was said, and they parted again for a while, until it was time for the three rings to pass away. quickly fading into the stones and the shadows the grey-cloaked people of lórien rode towards the mountains; and those who were going to rivendell sat on the hill and watched, until there came out of the gathering mist a flash; and then they saw no more. frodo knew that galadriel had held aloft her ring in token of farewell.
sam turned away and sighed: ‘i wish i was going back to lórien!’
at last one evening they came over the high moors, suddenly as to travellers it always seemed, to the brink of the deep valley of rivendell and saw far below the lamps shining in elrond’s house. and they went down and crossed the bridge and came to the doors, and all the house was filled with light and song for joy at elrond’s homecoming.

‘well, mr. frodo, we’ve been far and seen a deal, and yet i don’t think we’ve found a better place than this. there’s something of everything here, if you understand me: the shire and the golden wood and gondor and kings’ houses and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed. and yet, somehow, i feel we ought to be going soon. i’m worried about my gaffer, to tell you the truth.’

in the evening they went to say good-bye to bilbo. ‘well, if you must go, you must,’ he said. ‘i am sorry. i shall miss you. it is nice just to know that you are about the place. but i am getting very sleepy.’ then he gave frodo his mithril-coat and sting, forgetting that he had already done so; and he gave him also three books of lore that he had made at various times, written in his spidery hand, and labelled on their red backs: translations from the elvish, by b.b.
to sam he gave a little bag of gold. ‘almost the last drop of the smaug vintage,’ he said. ‘may come in useful, if you think of getting married, sam.’ sam blushed.
‘i have nothing much to give to you young fellows,’ he said to merry and pippin, ‘except good advice.’ and when he had given them a fair sample of this, he added a last item in shire-fashion: ‘don’t let your heads get too big for your hats! but if you don’t finish growing up soon, you are going to find hats and clothes

 of my ring, frodo, that you took away?’
‘i have lost it, bilbo dear,’ said frodo. ‘i got rid of it, you know.’
‘what a pity!’ said bilbo. ‘i should have liked to see it again. but no, how silly of me! that’s what you went for, wasn’t it: to get rid of it? but it is all so confusing, for such a lot of other things seem to have got mixed up with it: aragorn’s affairs, and the white council and gondor, and the horsemen, and southrons, and oliphaunts - did you really see one, sam? - and caves and towers and golden trees, and goodness knows what besides.
‘i evidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip. i think gandalf might have shown me round a bit. but then the auction would have been over before i got back, and i should have had even more trouble than i did. anyway it’s too late now; and really i think it’s much more comfortable to sit here and hear about it all. the fire’s very cosy here, and the food’s very good, and there are elves when yo

now far ahead the road has gone,
let others follow it who can!
let them a journey new begin,
but i at last with weary feet
will turn towards the lighted inn,
my evening-rest and sleep to meet.’
and as bilbo murmured the last words his head dropped on his chest and he slept soundly.
the evening deepened in the room, and the firelight burned brighter; and they looked at bilbo as he slept and saw that his face was smiling. for some time they sat in silence; and then sam looking round at the room and the shadows flickering on the walls, said softly:
‘i don’t think, mr. frodo, that he’s done much writing while we’ve been away. he won’t ever write our story now.’
at that bilbo opened an eye, almost as if he had heard. then he roused himself. ‘you see, i am getting so sleepy,’ he said. ‘and when i have time to write, i only really like writing poetry. i wonder, frodo my dear fellow, if you would very much mind tidying things up a bit before you g

‘of course i’ll do it!’ said frodo. ‘and of course i’ll come back soon: it won’t be dangerous any more. there is a real king now and he will soon put the roads in order.’
‘thank you, my dear fellow!’ said bilbo. ‘that really is a very great relief to my mind.’ and with that he fell fast asleep again.
the next day gandalf and the hobbits took leave of bilbo

t him. all that day he was silent. it was the sixth of october.
‘are you in pain, frodo?’ said gandalf quietly as he rode by frodo’s side.
‘well, yes i am,’ said frodo. ‘it is my shoulder. the wound aches, and the memory of darkness is heavy on me. it was a year ago today.’
‘alas! there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured,’ said gandalf.
‘i fear it may be so with mine,’ said frodo. ‘there is no real going back. though i may come to the shire, it will not seem the same; for i shall not be the same. i am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long burden. where shall i find rest?’
gandalf did not answer.
by the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed, and frodo was merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day before. after that the journey went well, and the days went quickly by; for they rode at leisure, and often they lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red and yellow in the autumn sun. at lengt

he gate-keeper scowled. ‘gone,’ he said. ‘but you’d best ask barliman. good evening!’
‘good evening to you!’ they said, and passed through; and then they noticed that behind the hedge at the road-side a long low hut had been built, and a number of men had come out and were staring at them over the fence. when they came to bill ferny’s house they saw that the hedge there was tattered and unkempt, and the windows were all boarded up.
‘do you think you killed him with that apple, sam?’ said pippin.
‘i’m not so hopeful, mr. pippin,’ said sam. ‘but i’d like to know what became of that poor pony. he’s been on my mind many a time and the wolves howling and all.’
at last they came to the prancing pony, and that at least looked outwardly unchanged; and there were lights behind the red curtains in the lower windows. they rang the bell, and nob came to the door, and opened it a crack and peeped through; and when he saw them standing under the lamp he gave a cry of s

stopped short, and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and delight.
‘nob, you woolly-pated ninny!’ he cried. ‘can’t you give old friends their names? you shouldn’t go scaring me like that, with times as they are. well, well! and where have you come from? i never expected to see any of you folk again, and that’s a fact: going off into the wild with that strider, and all those black men about. but i’m right glad to see you, and none more than gandalf. come in! come in! the same rooms as - before? they’re free. indeed most rooms are empty these days, as i’ll not hide from you, for you’ll find it out soon enough. and i’ll see what can be done about supper, as soon as may be; but i’m short-handed at present. hey, nob you slowcoach! tell bob! ah, but there i’m forgetting, bob’s gone: goes home to his folk at nightfall now. well, take the guests’ ponies to the stables, nob! and you’ll be taking your horse to his stable yourself gandalf; i don’t doubt.

loves it.’
‘does he now?’ said butterbur looking puzzled. ‘though i’m sure i don’t know why he should, sitting in his big chair up in his great castle, hundreds of miles away. and drinking wine out of a golden cup, i shouldn’t wonder. what’s the pony to him, or mugs o’ beer? not but what my beer’s good, gandalf. it’s been uncommon good, since you came in the autumn of last year and put a good word on it. and that’s been a comfort in trouble, i will say.’
‘ah!’ said sam. ‘but he says your beer is always good.’
‘he says?’
‘of course he does. he’s strider. the chief of the rangers. haven’t you got that into your head yet?’
it went in at last, and butterbur’s face was a study in wonder. the eyes in his broad face grew round, and his mouth opened wide, and he gasped. ‘strider!’ he exclaimed when he got back his breath. ‘him with a crown and all and a golden cup! well, what are we coming to?’
‘better times, for bree at any rate,’ said

‘now, now, mr. brandybuck, don’t go reminding me of that! but there, you’ve broken my thought. now where was i? nob, stables, ah! that was it. i’ve something that belongs to you. if you recollect bill ferny and the horsethieving: his pony as you bought, well, it’s here. come back all of itself, it did. but where it had been to you know better than me. it was as shaggy as an old dog and as lean as a clothes-rail, but it was alive. nob’s looked after it.’
‘what! my bill?’ cried sam. ‘well, i was born lucky, whatever my gaffer may say. there’s another wish come true! where is he?’ sam would not go to bed until he had visited bill in his stable.
the travellers stayed in bree all the next day, and mr. butterbur could not complain of his business next evening at any rate. curiosity overcame all fears, and his house was crowded. for a while out of politeness the hobbits visited the common room in the evening and answered a good many questions. bree memories being retenti

they wished him farewell and rode away, and passed through the west-gate and on towards the shire. bill the pony was with them, and as before he had a good deal of baggage, but he trotted along beside sam and seemed well content.
‘i wonder what old barliman was hinting at,’ said frodo.
‘i can guess some of it,’ said sam gloomily. ‘what i saw in the mirror: trees cut down and all, and my old gaffer turned out of the row. i ought to have hurried back quicker.’
‘and something’s wrong with the southfarthing evidently,’ said merry. ‘there’s a general shortage of pipe-weed.’
‘whatever it is,’ said pippin, ‘lotho will be at the bottom of it: you can be sure of that.’

w houses had been built: two-storeyed with narrow straight-sided windows, bare and dimly lit, all very gloomy and un-shirelike.
they hammered on the outer gate and called, but there was at first no answer; and then to their surprise someone blew a horn, and the lights in the windows went out. a voice shouted in the dark:
‘who’s that? be off! you can’t come in: can’t you read the notice: no admittance between sundown and sunrise?’
‘of course we can’t read the notice in the dark.’ sam shouted back. ‘and if hobbits of the shire are to be kept out in the wet on a night like this, i’ll tear down your notice when i find it.’
at that a window slammed, and a crowd of hobbits with lanterns poured out of the house on the left. they opened the further gate, and some came over the bridge. when they saw the travellers they seemed frightened.
‘come along!’ said merry, recognizing one of the hobbits. ‘if you don’t know me, hob hayward, you ought to. i am merry brandybuck, a

bill ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it. ‘give me the key!’ said merry. but the ruffian flung it at his head and then darted out into the darkness. as he passed the ponies one of them let fly with his heels and just caught him as he ran. he went off with a yelp into the night and was never heard of again.
‘neat work, bill,’ said sam, meaning the pony.
‘so much for your big man,’ said merry. ‘we’ll see the chief later. in the meantime we want a lodging for the night, and as you seem to have pulled down the bridge inn and built this dismal place instead, you’ll have to put us up.’
‘i am sorry, mr. merry,’ said hob, ‘but it isn’t allowed.’
‘what isn’t allowed?’
taking in folk off-hand like and eating extra food, and all that, said hob.
‘what’s the matter with the place?’ said merry. ‘has it

‘now you shut up, hob hayward!’ cried several of the others. ‘you know talk o’ that sort isn’t allowed. the chief will hear of it, and we’ll all be in trouble.’
‘he wouldn’t hear naught, if some of you here weren’t sneaks,’ rejoined hob hotly.
‘all right, all right!’ said sam. “that’s quite enough. i don’t want to hear no more. no welcome, no beer, no smoke, and a lot of rules and orc-talk instead. i hoped to have a rest, but i can see there’s work and trouble ahead. let’s sleep and forget it till morning!’
the new ‘chief’ evidently had means of getting news. it was a good forty miles from the bridge to bag end, but someone made the journey in a hurry. so frodo and his friends soon discovered.
they had not made any definite plans, but had vaguely tho

rather scared.
‘what’s all this?’ said frodo, feeling inclined to laugh.
this is what it is, mr. baggins, said the leader of the shirriffs, a two-feather hobbit: ‘you’re arrested for gate-breaking, and tearing up of rules, and assaulting gate-keepers, and trespassing, and sleeping in shire-buildings without leave, and bribing guards with food.’
‘and what else?’ said frodo.
‘that’ll do to go on with,’ said the shirriff-leader.
‘i can add some more, if you like it,’ said sam. ‘calling your chief names, wishing to punch his pimply face, and thinking you shirriffs look a lot of tom-fools.’
‘there now, mister, that’ll do. it’s the chief’s orders that you’re to come along quiet. we’re going to take you to bywater and hand you over to the chief’s men; and when he deals with your case you can have your say. but if you don’t want to stay in the lockholes any longer than you need, i should cut the say short, if i was you.’
to the discomfiture of the s

’
‘very well, mr. baggins,’ said the leader, pushing the barrier aside. ‘but don’t forget i’ve arrested you.’
‘i won’t,’ said frodo. ‘never. but i may forgive you. now i am not going any further today, so if you’ll kindly escort me to the floating log, i’ll be obliged.’
‘i can’t do that, mr. baggins. the inn’s closed. there’s a shirriff-house at the far end of the village. i’ll take you there. ‘
‘all right,’ said frodo. ‘go on and we’ll follow.’
sam had been looking the shirriffs up and down and had spotted one that he knew. ‘hey, come here robin smallburrow!’ he called. ‘i want a word with you.’
with a sheepish glance at his leader, who looked wrathful but did not dare to interfere, shirriff smallburrow fell back and walked beside sam, who got down off his pony.
‘look here, cock-robin!’ said sam. ‘you’re hobbiton-bred and ought to have more sense, coming a-waylaying mr. frodo and all. and what’s all this about the inn be

ing closed?’
‘they’re all closed,’ said robin. ‘the chief doesn’t hold with beer. leastways that is how it started. but now i reckon it’s his men that has it all. and he doesn’t hold with folk moving about; so if they will or they must, then they has to go to the shirriff-house and explain their business.’
‘you ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything to do with such nonsense,’ said sam. ‘you used to like the inside of an inn better than the outside yourself. you were always popping in, on duty or off.’
‘and so i would be still, sam, if i could. but don’t be hard on me. what can i do? you know how i went for a shirriff seven years ago, before any of this began. gave me a chance of walking round the country and seeing folk, and hearing the news, and knowing where the good beer was. but now it’s different.’
‘but you can give it up, stop shirriffing, if it has stopp

ed being a respectable job,’ said sam.
‘we’re not allowed to,’ said robin.
‘if i hear not allowed much oftener,’ said sam, ‘i’m going to get angry.’
‘can’t say as i’d be sorry to see it,’ said robin lowering his voice. ‘if we all got angry together something might be done. but it’s these men, sam, the chief’s men. he sends them round everywhere, and if any of us small folk stand up for our rights, they drag him off to the lockholes. they took old flourdumpling, old will whitfoot the mayor, first, and they’ve taken a lot more. lately it’s been getting worse. often they beat ‘em now.’
‘then why do you do their work far them?’ said sam angrily. ‘who sent you to frogmorton?’
‘no one did. we stay here in the big shirriff-house. we’re the first eastfarthing troop now. th

is it?’
‘that’s right. we aren’t allowed to send by it now, but they use the old quick post service, and keep special runners at different points. one came in from whitfurrows last night with a “secret message”, and another took it on from here. and a message came back this afternoon saying you was to be arrested and taken to bywater, not direct to the lockholes. the chief wants to see you at once, evidently.’
‘he won’t be so eager when mr. frodo has finished with him,’ said sam.
the shirriff-house at frogmorton was as bad as the bridge-house. it had only one storey, but it had the same narrow windows, and it was built of ugly pale bricks, badly laid. inside it was damp and cheerless, and supper was served on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks. the food deserved no better setting. the travellers were glad to leave the place. it was about eighteen miles to bywater, and they set off at ten o’clock in the morning. they would have started earlier, onl

y the delay so plainly annoyed the shirriff-leader. the west wind had shifted northward and it was turning colder, but the rain was gone.
it was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village, though the few folk that came out to stare at the ‘get-up’ of the travellers did not seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed. a dozen shirriffs had been told off as escort to the ‘prisoners’; but merry made them march in front, while frodo and his friends rode behind. merry, pippin, and sam sat at their ease laughing and talking and singing, while the shirriffs stumped along trying to look stern and important. frodo, however, was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful.
the last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge. ‘hullo, hullo!’ he jeered. ‘now who’s arrested who?’
two of the shirriffs immediately left the party and went towards him. ‘leader!’ said merry. ‘order your fellows back to their places at once, if you don’t want me to deal

that their ponies’ pace was quick enough to push the shirriffs along as fast as they could go. the sun came out, and in spite of the chilly wind they were soon puffing and sweating.
at the three-farthing stone they gave it up. they had done nearly fourteen miles with only one rest at noon. it was now three o’clock. they were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace.
‘well, come along in your own time!’ said merry. ‘we are going on.’
‘good-bye, cock-robin!’ said sam. ‘i’ll wait for you outside the green dragon, if you haven’t forgotten where that is. don’t dawdle on the way!’
‘you’re breaking arrest, that’s what you’re doing,’ said the leader ruefully, ‘and i can’t be answerable.’
‘we shall break a good many things yet, and not ask you to answer ‘ said pippin. ‘good luck to you!’
the travellers trotted on, and as the sun began to sink towards the white downs far away on the western horizon they came to bywater by its wide

pool; and there they had their first really painful shock. this was frodo and sam’s own country, and they found out now that they cared about it more than any other place in the world. many of the houses that they had known were missing. some seemed to have been burned down. the pleasant row of old hobbit-holes in the bank on the north side of the pool were deserted, and their little gardens that used to run down bright to the water’s edge were rank with weeds. worse, there was a whole line of the ugly new houses all along pool side, where the hobbiton road ran close to

the bank. an avenue of trees had stood there. they were all gone. and looking with dismay up the road towards bag end they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance. it was pouring out black smoke into the evening air.
sam was beside himself. ‘i’m going right on, mr. frodo!’ he cried. ‘i’m going to see what’s up. i want to find my gaffer.’
‘we ought to find out first what we’re in for, sam,’ said merry. ‘i guess that the “chief” will have a gang of ruffians handy. we had better find someone who will tell us how things are round here.’
but in the village of bywater all the houses and holes were shut, and no one greeted them. they wondered at this, but they soon discovered the reason of it. when they reached the green dragon, the last house on the hobbiton side, now lifeless and with broken windows, they were disturbed to see half a dozen large ill-favoured men lounging a

gainst the inn-wall; they were squint-eyed and sallow-faced.
‘like that friend of bill ferny’s at bree,’ said sam.
‘like many that i saw at isengard,’ muttered merry.
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts, but they had no other weapons, as far as could be seen. as the travellers rode up they left the wall and walked into the road, blocking the way.
‘where d’you think you’re going?’ said one, the largest and most evil-looking of the crew. ‘there’s no road for you any further. and where are those precious shirriffs?’
‘coming along nicely,’ said merry. ‘a littl

eyed rascal calling the ring-bearer ‘little cock-a-whoop’. he cast back his cloak, flashed out his sword, and the silver and sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward.
‘i am a messenger of the king,’ he said. ‘you are speaking to the king’s friend, and one of the most renowned in all the lands of the west. you are a ruffian and a fool. down on your knees in the road and ask pardon, or i will set this troll’s bane in you!’
the sword glinted in the westering sun. merry and sam drew their swords also and rode up to support pippin; but frodo did not move. the ruffians gave back. scaring breeland peasants, and bullying bewildered hobbits, had been their work. fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces were a great surprise. and there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that they had not heard before. it chilled them with fear.
‘go!’ said merry. ‘if you trouble this village again, you will regret it.’ the three hobbits came on, and then the ruffia

certainly mean fighting. you won’t rescue lotho, or the shire, just by being shocked and sad, my dear frodo.’
‘no,’ said pippin. ‘it won’t be so easy scaring them a second time. they were taken by surprise. you heard that horn-blowing? evidently there are other ruffians near at hand. they’ll be much bolder when there’s more of them together. we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night. after all we’re only four, even if we are armed.’
‘i’ve an idea,’ said sam. ‘let’s go to old tom cotton’s down south lane! he always was a stout fellow. and he has a lot of lads that were all friends of mine.’
‘no!’ said merry. ‘it’s no good “getting under cover”. that is just what people have been doing, and just what these ruffians like. they will simply come down on us in force, corner us, and then drive us out, or burn us in. no, we have got to do something at once.’
‘do what?’ said pippin.
‘raise the shire!’ said merry. ‘now! wake

all our people! they hate all this, you can see: all of them except perhaps one or two rascals, and a few fools that want to be important, but don’t at all understand what is really going on. but shire-folk have been so comfortable so long they don’t know what to do. they just want a match, though, and they’ll go up in fire. the chief’s men must know that. they’ll try to stamp on us and put us out quick. we’ve only got a very short time.
‘sam, you can make a dash for cotton’s farm, if you like. he’s the chief person round here, and the sturdiest. come on! i am going to blow the horn of rohan, and give them all some music they have never heard before.’
they rode back to the middle of the village. there sam turned aside and galloped off down the lane that led south to cotton’s. he had not gone far when he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up ringing into the sky. far over hill and field it echoed; and so compelling was that ca

ll that sam himself almost turned and dashed back. his pony reared and neighed.
‘on, lad! on!’ he cried. ‘we’ll be going back soon.’
then he heard merry change the note, and up went the horn-cry of buckland, shaking the air.
awake! awake! fear, fire, foes! awake!
fire, foes! awake!
behind him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and slamming of doors. in front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming; dogs barked; feet came running. before he got to the lane’s end there was farmer cotton with three of his lads, young tom, jolly, and nick, hurrying towards him. they had axes in their hands, and barred the way.
‘nay! it’s not one of them ruffians,’ sam heard the farmer say. ‘it’s a hobbit by the size of it, but all dressed up queer. hey!’ he cried. ‘who are you, an

d what’s all this to-do?’
‘it’s sam, sam gamgee. i’ve come back.’
farmer cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight. ‘well!’ he exclaimed. ‘the voice is right, and your face is no worse than it was, sam. but i should a’ passed you in the street in that gear. you’ve been in foreign parts, seemingly. we feared you were dead.’
‘that i ain’t!’ said sam. ‘nor mr. frodo. he’s here and his friends. and that’s the to-do. they’re raising the shire. we’re going to clear out these ruffians, and their chief too. we’re starting now.’
‘good, good!’ cried farmer cotton. ‘so it’s begun at last! i’ve been itching for trouble all this year, but folks wouldn’t help. and i’ve had the wife and rosie to think of. these ruffians don’t stick at nothing. but come on now, lads! bywater is up! we must be in it!’
‘what about mrs. co

tton and rosie?’ said sam. ‘it isn’t safe yet for them to be left all alone.’
‘my nibs is with them. but you can go and help him, if you have a mind,’ said farmer cotton with a grin. then he and his sons ran off towards the village.
sam hurried to the house. by the large round door at the top of the steps from the wide yard stood mrs. cotton and rosie, and nibs in front of them grasping a hay-fork.
‘it’s me!’ shouted sam as he trotted up. ‘sam gamgee! so don’t try prodding me, nibs. anyway, i’ve a mail-shirt on me.’
he jumped down from his pony and went up the steps. they stared at him in silence. ‘good evening, mrs. cotton!’ he said. ‘hullo rosie!’
‘hullo, sam!’ said rosie. ‘where’ve you been i they said you were dead; but i’ve been expecting you since the spring. you haven’t hurried have you?’
‘perhaps not,’ said sam abashed. ‘but i’m hurrying now. we’re setting about the ruffians, and i’ve g

ot to get back to mr. frodo. but i thought i’d have a look and see how mrs. cotton was keeping, and you, rosie.’
‘we’re keeping nicely, thank you,’ said mrs. cotton. ‘or should be, if it weren’t for these thieving ruffians.’
‘well, be off with you!’ said rosie. ‘if you’ve been looking after mr. frodo all this while, what d’you want to leave him for, as soon as things look dangerous?’
this was too much for sam. it needed a week’s answer, or none. he turned away and mounted his pony. but as he started off, rosie ran down the steps.
‘i think you look fine, sam,’ she said. ‘go on now! but take care of yourself, and come straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians!’
when sam got back he found the whole village roused. already, apart from many younger lads, more than a hundred sturdy hobbits were assembled with axes, and heavy hammers, and long knives, and stout staves: and a few had

 still coming in from outlying farms.
some of the village-folk had lit a large fire, just to enliven things, and also because it was one of the things forbidden by the chief. it burned bright as night came on. others at merry’s orders were setting up barriers across the road at each end of the village. when the shirriffs came up to the lower one they were dumbfounded; but as soon as they saw how things were, most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt. the others slunk away.
sam found frodo and his friends by the fire talking to old tom cotton, while an admiring crowd of bywater folk stood round and stared.
‘well, what’s the next move?’ said farmer cotton.
‘i can’t say,’ said frodo, ‘until i know more. how many of these ruffians are there?’
‘that’s hard to tell,’ said cotton. ‘they moves about and comes and goes. there’s sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up hobbiton way; but they go out from there roving round, thieving or “gathering”

on tookland. no one gets in nor out of it now.’
‘good for the tooks!’ cried pippin. ‘but someone is going to get in again, now. i am off to the smials. anyone coming with me to tuckborough?’
pippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponies. ‘see you soon!’ he cried. ‘it’s only fourteen miles or so over the fields. i’ll bring you back an army of tooks in the morning.’ merry blew a horn-call after them as they rode off into the gathering night. the people cheered.
‘all the same,’ said frodo to all those who stood near, ‘i wish for no killing; not even of the ruffians, unless it must be done, to prevent them from hurting hobbits.’
‘all right!’ said merry. ‘but we shall be having a visit from the hobbiton gang any time now, i think. they won’t come just to talk things over. we’ll try to deal with them neatly, but we must be prepared for the worst. now i’ve got a plan.’
‘very good,’ said frodo. ‘you make the arrangements.’

‘seems almost too easy after all, don’t it?’ said cotton. ‘i said we could master them. but we needed a call. you came back in the nick o’ time, mr. merry.’
‘there’s more to be done still,’ said merry. ‘if you’re right in your reckoning, we haven’t dealt with a tithe of them yet. but it’s dark now. i think the next stroke must wait until morning. then we must call on the chief.’
‘why not now?’ said sam. ‘it’s not much more than six o’clock. and i want to see my gaffer. d’you know what’s come of him, mr. cotton?’
‘he’s not too well, and not too bad, sam,’ said the farmer. ‘they dug up bagshot row, and that was a sad blow to him. he’s in one of them new houses that the chief’s men used to build while they still did any work other than burning and thieving: not above a mile from the end of bywater. but he comes around to me, when he gets a chance, and i see he’s better

‘thank’ee indeed, mr. cotton, and i’ll never forget it,’ said sam. ‘but i want to see him. that boss and that sharkey, as they spoke of, they might do a mischief up there before the morning.’
‘all right, sam,’ said cotton. ‘choose a lad or two, and go and fetch him to my house. you’ll not have need to go near the old hobbiton village over water. my jolly here will show you.’
sam went off. merry arranged for look-outs round the village and guards at the barriers during the night. then he and frodo went off with farmer cotton. they sat with the family in the warm kitchen, and the cottons asked a few polite questions about their travels, but hardly listened to the answers: they were far more c

‘ “sharkey,” says they. “so get out o’ the road, old hagling!”
‘ “i’ll give you sharkey, you dirty thieving ruffians!” says she, and ups with her umbrella and goes for the leader. near twice her size. so they took her. dragged her off to the lockholes, at her age too. they’ve took others we miss more, but there’s no denying she showed more spirit than most.’
into the middle of this talk came sam, bursting in with his gaffer. old gamgee did not look much older, but he was a little deafer.
‘good evening. mr. baggins!’ he said. ‘glad indeed i am to see you safe back. but i’ve a bone to pick with you, in a manner o’ speaking, if i may make so bold. you didn’t never ought to have a’ sold bag end, as i always said. that’s what started all the mischief. and while you’re been trapessing in foreign parts, chasing black men up mountains from what my sam says, though what for he

‘i am very sorry, mr. gamgee,’ said frodo. ‘but now i’ve come back, i’ll do my best to make amends.’
‘well, you can’t say fairer than that,’ said the gaffer. ‘mr. frodo baggins is a real gentlehobbit, i always have said, whatever you may think of some others of the name, begging your pardon. and i hope my sam’s behaved hisself and given satisfaction?’
‘perfect satisfaction, mr. gamgee,’ said frodo. ‘indeed, if you will believe it, he’s now one of the most famous people in all the lands, and they are making songs about his deeds from here to the sea and beyond the great river.’ sam blushed, but he looked gratefully at frodo, for rosie’s eyes were shining and she was smiling at him.
‘it takes a lot o’ believing,’ said the gaffer, ‘though i can see he’s been mixing in strange

essly, at its centre in bywater. but however grim they, might be, they seemed to have no leader among them who understood warfare. they came on without any precautions. merry laid his plans quickly.
the ruffians came tramping along the east road, and without halting turned up the bywater road, which ran for some way sloping up between high banks with low hedges on top. round a bend, about a furlong from the main road, they met a stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned. that halted them. at the same moment they became aware that the hedges on both sides, just above their heads, were all lined with hobbits. behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons that had been hidden in a field, and so blocked the way back. a voice spoke to them from above.
‘well, you have walked into a trap,’ said merry. ‘your fellows from hobbiton did the same, and one is dead and the rest are prisoners. lay down your weapons! then go back twenty paces and sit down. any who try to break out will

frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. when the fighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, merry, pippin, and sam joined him, and they rode back with the cottons. they ate a late midday meal, and then frodo said with a sigh: ‘well, i suppose it is time now that we dealt with the “chief”.’
‘yes indeed; the sooner the better,’ said merry. ‘and don’t be too gentle! he’s responsible for bringing in these ruffians, and for all the evil they have done.’
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits. ‘for it’s only a guess that there is no ruffians left at bag end,’

he said. ‘we don’t know.’ then they set out on foot. frodo, sam, merry, and pippin led the way.
it was one of the saddest hours in their lives. the great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow. all along the bywater road every tree had been felled.
as they crossed the bridge and looked up the

hill they gasped. even sam’s vision in the mirror had not prepared him for what they saw. the old grange on the west side had been knocked down, and its place taken by rows of tarred sheds. all the chestnuts were gone. the banks and hedgerows were broken. great waggons were standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of grass. bagshot row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry. bag end up. beyond could not be seen for a clutter of large huts.
‘they’ve cut it down!’ cried sam. ‘they’ve cut down the party tree!’ he pointed to where the tree. had stood under which bilbo had made his farewell speech. it was lying lopped and dead in the field. as if this was the last straw sam burst into tears.
a laugh put an end to them. there was a surly hobbit lounging over the low wall of the mill-yard. he was grimy-faced and black-handed. ‘don’t ‘ee like it, sam?’ he sneered. ‘but you always was soft. i thought you’d gone off in one o’ them ships you used to pra

‘so i see,’ said sam. ‘no time for washing, but time for wall-propping. but see here, master sandyman, i’ve a score to pay in this village, and don’t you make it any longer with your jeering, or you’ll foot a bill too big for your purse.’
ted sandyman spat over the wall: ‘garn!’ he said. ‘you can’t touch me. i’m a friend o’ the boss’s. but he’ll touch you all right, if i have any more of your mouth.’
‘don’t waste any more words on the fool, sam!’ said frodo. ‘i hope there are not

 the door was scarred; the bell-chain was dangling loose, and the bell would not ring. knocking brought no answer. at length they pushed and the door yielded. they went in. the place stank and was full of filth and disorder: it did not appear to have been used for some time.
‘where is that miserable lotho hiding?’ said merry. they had searched every room and found no living thing save rats and mice. ‘shall we turn on the others to search the sheds?’
‘this is worse than mordor!’ said sam. ‘much worse in a way. it comes home to you, as they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it was all ruined.’
‘yes, this is mordor,’ said frodo. ‘just one of its works. saruman was doing its work all the time, even when he thought he was working for himself. and the same with those that saruman tricked, like lotho.’
merry looked round in dismay and disgust. ‘let’s get out!’ he said. ‘if i had known all the mischief he had caused, i should have stuffed my pouch

‘worm! worm!’ saruman called; and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue, crawling, almost like a dog. to the road again, worm!’ said saruman. ‘these fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again. come along!’
saruman turned to go, and wormtongue shuffled after him. but even as saruman passed close to frodo a knife flashed in his hand, and he stabbed swiftly. the blade turned on the hidden mail-coat and snapped. a dozen hobbits, led by sam, leaped forward with a cry and flung the villain to the ground. sam drew his sword.
‘no, sam!’ said frodo. ‘do not kill him even now. for he has not hurt me. and in any case i do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. he was great once, of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands against. he is fallen, and his cure is beyond us; but i would still spare him, in the hope that he may find it.’
saruman rose to his feet, and stared at frodo. there was a strange look in hi

for a moment it wavered, looking to the west; but out of the west came a cold wind, and it bent away, and with a sigh dissolved into nothing.
frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, and the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull. lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it, he covered it over, and turned away.
‘and that’s the end of that,’ said sam. ‘a nasty end, and i wish i needn’t have seen it; but it’s a good riddance.’
‘and the very last end of the war, i hope,’ said merry.
‘i hope so,’ said frodo and sighed. ‘the very last stroke. but to think that it should fall here, at the very door of bag end! among all my hopes and fears at least i never expected that.’
‘i shan’t call it the end, till we’ve cleared up the mess,’ said sam gloomily. ‘and that’ll take a lot of time and work.’

the clearing up certainly needed a lot of work, but it took less time than sam had feared. the day after the battle frodo rode to michel delving and released the prisoners from the lockholes. one of the first that they found was poor fredegar bolger, fatty no longer. he had been taken when the ruffians smoked out a band of rebels that he led from their hidings up in the brockenbores by the hills of scary.
‘you would have done better to come with us after all, poor old fredegar!’ said pippin, as they carried him out too weak to walk.

 deputy mayor was to reduce the shirriffs to their proper functions and numbers. the task of hunting out the last remnant of the ruffians was left to merry and pippin, and it was soon done. the southern gangs, after hearing the news of the battle of bywater, fled out of the land and offered little resistance to the thain. before the year’s end the few survivors were rounded up in the woods, and those that surrendered were shown to the borders.
meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace, and sam was kept very busy. hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them. now there were thousands of willing hands of all ages, from the small but nimble ones of the hobbit lads and lasses to the well-worn and horny ones of the gaffers and gammers. before yule not a brick was left standing of the new shirriff-houses or of anything that had been built by ‘sharkey’s men’; but the bricks were used to repair many an old hole, to make it snugger and drier. great stores of goods

‘it’s an ill wind as blows nobody no good, as i always say. and all’s well as ends better!’
there was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given. battle gardens was thought of, or better smials. but after a while in sensible hobbit-fashion it was just called new row. it was a purely bywater joke to refer to it as sharkey’s end.
the trees were the worst loss and damage, for at sharkey’s bidding they had been cut down recklessly far and wide over the shire; and sam grieved over this more than anything else. for one thing, this hurt would take long to heal, and only his great-grandchildren, he thought, would see the shire as it ought to be.
then suddenly one day, for he had been too busy for weeks to give a thought to his adventures, he remembered the gift of galadriel. he brought the box out and showed it to the other travellers (for so they were now called by everyone), and asked their advice.
‘i wondered when you would think of it,’ said frodo. ‘o

inside it was filled with a grey dust, soft and fine, in the middle of which was a seed, like a small nut with a silver shale. ‘what can i do with this?’ said sam.
‘throw it in the air on a breezy day and let it do its work!’ said pippin.
‘on what?’ said sam.
‘choose one spot as a nursery, and see what happens to the plants there,’ said merry.
‘but i’m sure the lady would not like me to keep it all for my own garden, now so many folk have suffered,’ said sam.
‘use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own, sam,’ said frodo, ‘and then use the gift to help your work and better it. and use it sparingly. there is not much here, and i expect every grain has a value.’
so sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in the soil at the root of each. he went up and down the shire in this labour; but if he paid special attention to hobbiton and bywa

except those who had to mow the grass.
in the southfarthing the vines were laden, and the yield of ‘leaf’ was astonishing; and everywhere there was so much corn that at harvest every barn was stuffed. ‘the northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of 1420 malt was long remembered and became a byword. indeed a generation later one might hear an old gaffer in an inn, after a good pint of well-earned ale, put down his mug with a sigh: ‘ah! that was proper fourteen-twenty, that was!’
sam stayed at first at the cottons’ with frodo; but when the new row was ready he went with the gaffer. in addition to all his other labours he was busy directing the cleaning up and restoring of bag end; but he was often away in the shire on his forestry work. so he was not at home in early march and did not know that frodo had been ill. on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton found frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching a white gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half

in a dream.
‘it is gone for ever,’ he said, ‘and now all is dark and empty.’
but the fit passed, and when sam got back on the twenty-fifth, frodo had recovered, and he said nothing about himself. in the meanwhile bag end had been set in order, and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon looked very much as it always had done.
when all was at last ready frodo said: ‘when are you going to move in and join me, sam?’
sam looked a bit awkward.
‘there is no need to come yet, if you don’t want to,’ said frodo. ‘but you know the gaffer is close at hand, and he will be very well looked after by widow rumble.’
it s not that, mr. frodo, said sam, and he went very red.
‘well, what is it?’
‘it’s rosie, rose cotton,’ said sam. ‘it seems she didn’t like my going abroad at all, poor lass; but as i hadn’t spoken, she couldn’t say so. and i didn’t speak, because i had a job to do first. 
 
 ___________________________
 
but now i have spoken, and she says: “well, you’ve wasted a year, so why wait longer?” “wasted?” i says. “i wouldn’t call it that.” still i see what she means. i feel torn in two, as you might say.’
‘i see,’ said frodo: ‘you want to get married, and yet you want to live with me in bag end too? but my dear sam, how easy! get married as soon as you can, and then move in with rosie. there’s room enough in bag end for as big a family as you could wish for.’
and so it was settled. sam gamgee married rose cotton in the spring of 1420 (which was also famous for its weddings), and they came and lived at bag end. and if sam thought himself lucky, frodo knew that he was more lucky himself; for there was not a hobbit in the shire that was looked after with such care. when the labours of repair had all been

t a great dash in the shire with their songs and their tales and their finery, and their wonderful parties. ‘lordly’ folk called them, meaning nothing but good; for it warmed all hearts to see them go riding by with their mail-shirts so bright and their shields so splendid, laughing and singing songs of far away; and if they were now large and magnificent, they were unchanged otherwise, unless they were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merriment than ever before.
frodo and sam, however, went back to ordinary attire, except that when there was need they both wore long grey cloaks, finely woven and clasped at the throat with beautiful brooches; and mr. frodo wore always a white jewel on a chain that he often would finger.
all things now went well, with hope always of becoming still better; and sam was as busy and as full of delight as even a hobbit could wish. nothing for him marred that whole year, except for some vague anxiety about his master. frodo dropped quietly

out of all the doings of the shire, and sam was pained to notice how little honour he had in his own country. few people knew or wanted to know about his deeds and adventures; their admiration and respect were given mostly to mr. meriadoc and mr. peregrin and (if sam had known it) to himself. also in the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubles.
one evening sam came into the study and found his master looking very strange. he was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away.
‘what’s the matter, mr. frodo?’ said sam.
‘i am wounded,’ he answered, ‘wounded; it will never really heal.’
but then he got up, and the turn seemed to pass, and he was quite himself the next day. it was not until afterwards that sam recalled that the date was october the sixth. two years before on that day it was dark in the dell under weathertop.

on, and 1421 came in. frodo was ill again in march, but with a great effort he concealed it, for sam had other things to think about. the first of sam and rosie’s children was born on the twenty-fifth of march, a date that sam noted.
‘well, mr. frodo,’ he said. ‘i’m in a bit of a fix. rose and me had settled to call him frodo, with your leave; but it’s not him, it’s her. though as pretty a maidchild as any one could hope for, taking after rose more than me, luckily. so we don’t know what to do.’
‘well, sam,’ said frodo, ‘what’s wrong with the old customs? choose a flower name like rose. half the maidchildren in the shire are called by such names, and what could be better?’
‘i suppose you

re right, mr. frodo,’ said sam. ‘i’ve heard some beautiful names on my travels, but i suppose they’re a bit too grand for daily wear and tear, as you might say. the gaffer, he says: “make it short, and then you won’t have to cut it short before you can use it.” but if it’s to be a flower-name, then i don’t trouble about the length: it must be a beautiful flower, because, you see, i think she is very beautiful, and is going to be beautifuller still.’
frodo thought for a moment. ‘well, sam, what about elano

r, the sun-star, you remember the little golden flower in the grass of lothlórien?’
‘you’re right again, mr. frodo!’ said sam delighted. ‘that’s what i wanted.’
little elanor was nearly six months old, and 1421 had passed to its autumn, when frodo called sam into the study.
‘it will be bilbo’s birthday on thursday, sam,’ he said. ‘and he will pass the old took. he will be a hundred and thirty-one!’
‘so he will!’ said sam. ‘he’s a marvel!’
‘well, sam,’ said frodo. ‘i want you to see rose and find out if she can spare you, so that you and i can go off together. you can’t go far or for a long time now, of course,’ he said a little wistfully.
‘well, not very well, mr. frodo.’
‘of course not. but never mind. you can see me on my way. tell rose that you won’t be away very long, not more than a fortnight; and you’ll come back quite safe.’
‘i wish i could go all the way with you to rivendell, mr. frodo, and see mr. bilbo,’

said sam. ‘and yet the only place i really want to be in is here. i am that torn in two.’
‘poor sam! it will feel like that, i am afraid,’ said frodo. ‘but you will be healed. you were meant to be solid and whole, and you will be.’
in the next day or two frodo went through his papers and his writings with sam, and he handed over his keys. there was a big book with plain red leather covers; its tall pages were now almost filled. at the beginning there were many leaves covered with bilbo’s thin wandering hand; but most of it was written in frodo’s firm flowing script. it was divided into chapters but chapter 80 was unfinished, and after that were some blank leaves. the title page had many titles on it, crossed out one after another, so:

‘why, you have nearly finished it, mr. frodo!’ sam exclaimed. ‘well, you have kept at it, i must say.’
‘i have quite finished, sam,’ said frodo. ‘the last pages are for you.’
on september the twenty-first they set out together, frodo on the pony that had borne him all the way from minas tirith, and was now called strider; and sam on his beloved bill. it was a fair golden morning, and sam did not ask where they were going: he thought he could guess.
they took the stock road over the hills and went towards the woody end, and they let

their ponies walk at their leisure. they camped in the green hills, and on september the twenty-second they rode gently down into the beginning of the trees as afternoon was wearing away.
‘if that isn’t the very tree you hid behind when the black rider first showed up, mr. frodo!’ said sam pointing to the left. ‘it seems like a dream now.’
it was evening, and the stars were glimmering in the eastern sky as they passed the ruined oak and turned and went on down the hill between the hazel-thickets. sam was silent, deep in his memories. presently he became aware that frodo was singing softly to himself, singing the old walking-song, but the words were not quite the same.

and as if in answer, from down below, coming up the road out of the valley, voices sang:

frodo and sam halted and sat silent in the soft shadows, until they saw a shimmer as the travellers came towards them.
there was gildor and many fair elven folk; and there to sam’s wonder rode elrond and galadriel. elrond wore a mantle of grey and had a star upon his forehead, and a silver harp was in his hand, and upon his finger was a ring of gold with a great blue stone, vilya, mightiest of the three. but galadriel sat upon a white palfrey and was robed all in glimmering white, like clouds about the moo

n; for she herself seemed to shine with a soft light. on her finger was nenya, the ring wrought of mithril, that bore a single white stone flickering like a frosty star. riding slowly behind on a small grey pony, and seeming to nod in his sleep, was bilbo himself.
elrond greeted them gravely and graciously, and galadriel smiled upon them. ‘well, master samwise,’ she said. ‘i hear and see that you have used my gift well. the shire shall now be more than ever blessed and beloved.’ sam bowed, but found nothing to say. he had forgotten how beautiful the lady was.
then bilbo woke up and opened his eyes. ‘hullo, frodo!’ he said. ‘well, i have passed the old took today! so that’s settled. and now i think i am quite ready to go on another journey. are you coming?’
‘yes, i am coming,’ said frodo. ‘the ring-bearers should go together.’
‘where are you going, master?’ cried sam, though at last he understood what was happening.
‘to the havens, sam,’ said frodo

.
‘and i can’t come.’
‘no, sam. not yet anyway, not further than the havens. though you too were a ring-bearer, if only for a little while. your time may come. do not be too sad, sam. you cannot be always torn in two. you will have to be one and whole, for many years. you have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do.’
‘but,’ said sam, and tears started in his eyes, ‘i thought you were going to enjoy the shire, too. for years and years, after all you have done.’
‘so i thought too, once. but i have been too deeply hurt, sam. i tried to save the shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. it must often be so, sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them. but you are my heir: all that i had and might have had i leave to you. and also you have rose, and elanor; and

r beloved land all the more. and that will keep you as busy and as happy as anyone can be, as long as your part of the story goes on.
‘come now, ride with me!’
then elrond and galadriel rode on; for the third age was over, and the days of the rings were passed, and an end was come of the story and song of those times. with them went many elves of the high kindred who would no longer stay in middle-earth; and among them, filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and without bitterness, rode sam, and frodo, and bilbo, and the elves delighted to honour them.
though they rode through the midst of the shire all the evening and all the night, none saw them pass, save the wild creatures; or here and there some wanderer in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the trees, or a light and shadow flowing through the grass as the moon went westward. and when they had passed from the shire, going about the south skirts of the white downs, they came to the far downs, and to the towers, and looked

s stars; and he looked at them and bowed, and said: ‘all is now ready.’
then círdan led them to the havens, and there was a white ship lying, and upon the quay beside a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them. as he turned and came towards them frodo saw that gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the third ring, narya the great, and the stone upon it was red as fire. then those who were to go were glad, for they knew that gandalf also would take ship with them.
but sam was now sorrowful at heart, and it seemed to him that if the parting would be bitter, more grievous still would be the long road home alone. but even as they stood there, and the elves were going aboard, and all was being made ready to depart, up rode merry and pippin in great haste. and amid his tears pippin laughed.
‘you tried to give us the slip once before and failed, frodo.’ he said. ‘this time you have nearly succeeded, but you have failed again. it was not sam, though, that gave yo

u away this time, but gandalf himself!’
‘yes,’ said gandalf; ‘for it will be better to ride back three together ‘than one alone. well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle-earth. go in peace! i will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.’
then frodo kissed merry and pippin, and last of all sam, and went aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and slowly the ship slipped away down the long grey firth; and the light of the glass of galadriel that frodo bore glimmered and was lost. and the ship went out into the high sea and passed on into the west, until at last on a night of rain frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water. and then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of bombadil, the grey rain-curta

in turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise.
but to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the haven; and as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was soon lost in the west. there still he stood far into the night, hearing only the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores of middle-earth, and the sound of them sank deep into his heart. beside him stood merry and pippin, and they were silent.
at last the three companions turned away, and never again looking back they rode slowly homewards; and they spoke no

word to one another until they came back to the shire. but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road.
at last they rode over the downs and took the east road, and then merry and pippin rode on to buckland; and already they were singing again as they went. but sam turned to bywater, and so came back up the hill, as day was ending once more. and he went on, and there was yellow light, and fire within; and the evening meal was ready, and he was expected. and rose drew him in, and set him in his chair, and put little elanor upon his lap.
he drew a deep breath. ‘well, i’m back,’ he said.
