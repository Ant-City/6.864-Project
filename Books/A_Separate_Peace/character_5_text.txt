 was on the surface being congratulated. i felt fine.i think that was better than finnys, said elwinbetter known as leperlepellier, who was bidding for an ally in the dispute he foresaw.all right, pal, finny spoke in his cordial, penetrating voice, that reverberant instrument in his chest, dont start awarding prizes until youve passed the course. the tree is waiting.leper closed his mouth as though forever. he didnt argue or refuse. he didnt back away. he became inanimate. but the other two, chet douglass and bobby zane, were vocal enough, complaining shrilly about school regulations, the danger of stomach cramps, physical disabilities they had never mentioned before.its you, pal, finny said to me at last, just you and me. he and i started back across the fields, preceding the others like two seigneurs.we were the best of friends at that moment.you were very good, said finny good-humoredly, once i shamed you into it.you didnt shame anybody into anything.oh yes i did. im good for you that wa

, run! ordered finny. no, not that way! toward the river! run! i headed toward the river surrounded by the others in a hesitant herd; they sensed that in all probability they were my adversaries in blitzball. dont hog it! finny yelled. throw it to somebody else. otherwise, naturally, he talked steadily as he ran along beside me, now that weve got you surrounded, one of us will knock you down.do what! i veered away from him, hanging on to the clumsy ball. what kind of a game is that?blitzball! chet douglass shouted, throwing himself around my legs, knocking me down.that naturally was completely illegal, said finny. you dont use your arms when you knock the ball carrier down.you dont? mumbled chet from on top of me.no. you keep your arms crossed like this on your chest, and you just butt the ball carrier. no elbowing allowed either. all right, gene, start again.i began quickly, wouldnt somebody else have possession of the ball afternot when youve been knocked down illegally. the ball carrier r

himself. but what did go on in his mind? if i was the head of the class and won that prize, then we would be even.his head started to come up, and mine snapped down. i glared at the textbook. relax, he said. your brainll explode if you keep this up.you dont need to worry about me, finny.im not worried.you wouldnt i wasnt sure i had the control to put this questionmind if i wound up head of the class, would you?mind? two clear green-blue eyes looked at me. fat chance youve got, anyway, with chet douglass around.but you wouldnt mind, would you? i repeated in a lower and more distinct voice.he gave me that half-smile of his, which had won him a thousand conflicts. id kill myself out of jealous envy.i believed him. the joking manner was a screen; i believed him. in front of my eyes the trigonometry textbook blurred into a jumble. i couldnt see. my brain exploded. he minded, despised the possibility that i might be the head of the school. there was a swift chain of explosions in my brain, one ce

rtainty after another blastedup like a detonation went the idea of any best friend, up went affection and partnership and sticking by someone and relying on someone absolutely in the jungle of a boys school, up went the hope that there was anyone in this schoolin this worldwhom i could trust. chet douglass, i said uncertainly, is a sure thing for it.my misery was too deep to speak any more. i scanned the page; i was having trouble breathing, as though the oxygen were leaving the room. amid its devastation my mind flashed from thought to thought, despairingly in search of something left which it could rely on. not rely on absolutely, that was obliterated as a possibility, just rely on a little, some solace, something surviving in the ruins.i found it. i found a single sustaining thought. the tho

ecially his procession of ds in every subject. that way he, the great athlete, would be way ahead of me. it was all cold trickery, it was all calculated, it was all enmity.i felt better. yes, i sensed it like the sweat of relief when nausea passes away; i felt better. we were even after all, even in enmity. the deadly rivalry was on both sides after all.i became quite a student after that. i had always been a good one, although i wasnt really interested and excited by learning itself, the way chet douglass was. now i became not just good but exceptional, with chet douglass my only rival in sight. but i began to see that chet was weakened by the very genuineness of his interest in learning. he got carried away by things; for example, he was so fascinated by the tilting planes of solid geometry that he did almost as badly in trigonometry as i did myself. when we read candide it opened up a new way of looking at the world to chet, and he continued hungrily reading voltaire, in french, while the clas

 person who was most often and most emphatically taken by surprise, by this and every other shift in our life at devon.the heavy snow paralyzed the railroad yards of one of the large towns south of us on the boston and maine line. at chapel the day following the heaviest snowfall, two hundred volunteers were solicited to spend the day shoveling them out, as part of the emergency usefulness policy adopted by the faculty that fall. again we would be paid. so we all volunteered, brinker and i and chet douglass and even i noticed, quackenbush.but not leper. he generally made little sketches of birds and trees in the back of his notebook during chapel, so that he had probably not heard the announcement. the train to take us south to the work did not arrive until after lunch, and on my way to the station, taking a short cut through a meadow not far from the river, i met leper. i had hardly seen him all fall, and i hardly recognized him now. he was standing motionless on the top of a small ridge, and he

fund. brinker placed this last prize on the table with such silent dignity that we all thought it was better not to ask any questions about it.phineas sat behind the table in a heavily carved black walnut chair; the arms ended in two lions heads, and the legs ended in paws gripping wheels now sunk in the snow. he had made the purchase that morning. phineas bought things only on impulse and only when he had the money, and since the two states rarely coincided his purchases were few and strange.chet douglass stood next to him holding his trumpet. finny had regretfully given up the plan of inviting the school band to supply music, since it would have spread news of our carnival to every corner of the campus. chet in any case was an improvement over that cacophony. he was a slim, fair-skinned boy with a ball of curly auburn hair curving over his forehead, and he devoted himself to playing two things, tennis and the trumpet. he did both with such easy, inborn skill that after observing him i had begun

ebukingly. who ever heard of opening the games without the sacred fire from olympus?sensing that i must act as the chorus, i registered on my face the universally unheard-of quality of the games without fire. fire, fire, i said across the damp snow.well sacrifice one of the prizes, said phineas, seizing the iliad. he sprinkled the pages with cider to make them more inflammable, touched a match to them, and a little jet of flame curled upward. the games, alight with homer and cider, were open.chet douglass, leaning against the side of the prize table, continued to blow musical figures for his own enlightenment. forgetful of us and the athletic programing finny now put into motion, he strolled here and there, sometimes at the start of the ski jump competition, blowing an appropriate call, more often invoking the serene order of haydn, or a high, remote, arrogant spanish world, or the cheerful, lowdown carelessness of new orleans.the hard cider began to take charge of us. or i wonder now whether i
