-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows. neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
crisply-curling short dark hair. he was a dark man altogether, with good
eyes and a good bold breadth between them. good-humoured looking on
the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong
resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing
down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn
the man.

madame defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he
came in. madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with
a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand
heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of
manner. there was a character about madame defarge, from which one might
have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
in any of the reckonings over which she presided. madame defarge being
sensitive to cold,

was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright
shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large
earrings. her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick
her teeth with a toothpick. thus engaged, with her right elbow supported
by her left hand, madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but
coughed just one grain of cough. this, in combination with the lifting
of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while
he stepped over the way.

the wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
a c

â€œwhat the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?â€ said monsieur defarge
to himself; â€œi donâ€™t know you.â€

but, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.

â€œhow goes it, jacques?â€ said one of these three to monsieur defarge. â€œis
all the spilt wine swallowed?â€

â€œevery drop, jacques,â€ answered monsieur defarge.

when this interchange of christian name was effected, madame defarge,
picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,
and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.

â€œit is not often,â€ said the second of the three, addressing monsieur
defarge, â€œthat many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or
of anything but black bread and death. is it not so, jacques?â€

â€œit is so, jacques,â€ monsieur defarge returned.

using her toothpick w

the last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips.

â€œah! so much the worse! a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, jacques. am i
right, jacques?â€

â€œyou are right, jacques,â€ was the response of monsieur defarge.

this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment
when madame defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and
slightly rustled in her seat.

â€œhold then! true!â€ muttered her husband. â€œgentlemen--my wife!â€

the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge, with three
flourishes. she acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and
giving them a quick look. then she glanced in a casual manner round the
wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
of spirit, and became absorbed in it.

â€œgentlemen,â€

defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.

â€œwillingly, sir,â€ said monsieur defarge, and quietly stepped with him to
the door.

their conference was very short, but very decided. almost at the first
word, monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive. it had
not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. the gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. madame defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.

mr. jarvis lorry and miss manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,
joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
company just before. it opened from a stinking little black courtyard,
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited
by a great number of people. in the gloomy tile-paved entry to the
gloomy tile-paved staircase, monsieur defarge bent down on one knee

him. on their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was
no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he
dropped his daughterâ€™s hand and clasped his head again.

no crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the
many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. an unnatural
silence and desertion reigned there. only one soul was to be seen, and
that was madame defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and
saw nothing.

the prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed
him, when mr. lorryâ€™s feet were arrested on the step by his asking,
miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. madame
defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and
went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. she quickly
brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned

ce of money on the counter to save their souls. these
were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,
and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy
looks.

notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop
was not visible. he was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the
threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see
only madame defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of
wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced
and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.

a suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in
at every place, high and low, from the kingâ€™s palace to the criminalâ€™s
gaol. games at cards languished, players at

high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
his swinging lamps: of whom, one was monsieur defarge: the other a

the wine-shop. their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast

the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.

â€œgood day, gentlemen!â€ said monsieur defarge.

it may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. it elicited
an answering chorus of â€œgood day!â€

â€œit is bad weather, gentlemen,â€ said defarge, shaking his head.

upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down
their eyes and sat silent. except one man, who got up and went out.

â€œmy wife,â€ said defarge aloud, addressing madame defarge: â€œi have
travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
jacques. i met him--by accident--a day and halfâ€™s journey out of paris.
he is a good child, this mender of roads, called jacques. give him to
drink, my wife!â€

a second man got up and went out. madame defarge set wine before the
mender of roads called jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,
and drank. in the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
bread; he ate of this between whiles, and

defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less
than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
he looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even
madame defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.

â€œhave you finished your repast, friend?â€ he asked, in due season.

â€œyes, thank you.â€

â€œcome, then! you shall see the apartment that i told you you could
occupy. it will suit you to a marvel.â€

safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always
be able to decipher it--or, i ought to say, will she?â€

â€œjacques,â€ returned defarge, drawing himself up, â€œif madame my wife
undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose
a word of it--not a syllable of it. knitted, in her own stitches and her

to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of madame defarge.â€

there was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who
hungered, asked: â€œis this rustic to be sent back soon? i hope so. he is
very simple; is he not a little dangerous?â€

â€œhe knows nothing,â€ said defarge; â€œat least nothing more than would

 mender of roads was not enchanted
(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
and himself to versailles. it was additionally disconcerting to have
madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was
additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the
afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
see the carriage of the king and queen.

â€œyou work hard, madame,â€ said a man near her.

â€œyes,â€ answered madame defarge; â€œi have a good deal to do.â€

â€œwhat do you make, madame?â€

â€œmany things.â€

â€œfor instance--â€

â€œfor instance,â€ returned madame defarge, composedly, â€œshrouds.â€

the man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender
of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close
and oppressive. if he needed a king and queen to restore him, he was
fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced king

â€œthese fools know nothing. while they despise your breath, and would

in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath

madame defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
confirmation.

it made a show and a noise. say! would you not?â€

madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of saint antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of monsieur the marquis, now in his grave, listened to
the whispering trees. such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,
for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village
scarecrows who, in their quest

guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
examination and inquiry. monsieur defarge alighted; knowing one or two
of the soldiery there, and one of the police. the latter he was intimate
with, and affectionately embraced.

when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarges in his dusky wings,
and they, having finally alighted near the saintâ€™s boundaries, were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
streets, madame defarge spoke to her husband:

â€œsay then, my friend; what did jacques of the police tell thee?â€

â€œvery little to-night, but all he knows. there is another spy
commissioned for our quarter. there may be many more, for all that he
can say, but he knows of one.â€

â€œeh well!â€ said madame defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool
business air. â€œit is necessary to register him. how do they call that
man?â€

â€œhe is english.â€

â€œso much the better. his name?â€

â€œbarsad,â€

â€œage, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;
complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face
thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,
sinister.â€

â€œeh my faith. it is a portrait!â€ said madame, laughing. â€œhe shall be
registered to-morrow.â€

they turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),
and where madame defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted
the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the
stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of
her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally
dismissed him to bed. then she turned out the contents of the bowl
of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the
night. all this while, defarge, with

ing their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell
dead at the bottom. their decease made no impression on the other flies
out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they
themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met
the same fate. curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they
thought as much at court that sunny summer day.

a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge which she
felt to be a new one. she laid down her knitting, and began to pin her
rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.

it was curious. the moment madame defarge took up the rose, the
customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the
wine-shop.

â€œgood day, madame,â€ said the new-comer.

â€œgood day, monsieur.â€

she said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:
â€œhah! good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine,

â€œdecidedly. may one ask what it is for?â€

â€œpastime,â€ said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her
fingers moved nimbly.

â€œnot for use?â€

â€œthat depends. i may find a use for it one day. if i do--well,â€ said
madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of
coquetry, â€œiâ€™ll use it!â€

it was remarkable; but, the taste of saint antoine seemed to be
decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of madame defarge. two
men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,
catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of
looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.
nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there
one left. they had all dropped off. the spy had kept his eyes open,
but had been able to detect no sign. they had lounged away in a
poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and

price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.â€

â€œi believe,â€ said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone
that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary
susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: â€œi believe there
is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor
fellow? between ourselves.â€

â€œis there?â€ asked madame, vacantly.

â€œis there not?â€

â€œ--here is my husband!â€ said madame defarge.

as the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted
him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, â€œgood day,
jacques!â€ defarge stopped short, and stared at him.

â€œgood day, jacques!â€ the spy repeated; with not quite so much
confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.

â€œyou deceive yourself, monsieur,â€ returned the keeper of the wine-shop.
â€œyou mistake me for another. that is not my name. i am ernest defarge.â€

having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his
hand on the back of his wifeâ€™s chair, looking over that barrier at the
person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would
have shot with the greatest satisfaction.

the spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious
attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh
water, and asked for another glass of cognac. madame defarge poured it
out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over
it.

â€œyou seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than i do?â€
 observed defarge.

â€œnot at all, but i hope to know it better. i am so profoundly interested
in its miserable inhabitants.â€

â€œhah!â€ muttered defarge.

â€œthe pleasure of conversing with you, monsieur defarge, recalls to me,â€
 pursued the spy, â€œthat i have the honour of cherishing some interesting

madame defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband. do what he would, behind the little counter,
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was
troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. the spy would have been no
spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.

worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, mr. barsad

in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again. for some minutes
after he had emerged into the outer presence of saint antoine, the
husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should
come back.

â€œcan it be true,â€ said defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife
as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: â€œwhat he has
said of maâ€™amselle manette?â€

â€œas he has said it,â€ returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, â€œit
is probably false. but it may be true.â€

â€œwill take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is
to end him. that is all i know.â€

â€œbut it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strangeâ€--said
defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,
â€œthat, after all our sympathy for monsieur her father, and herself, her

so resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to
draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been
struggling in the surf at the south sea, until he was landed in the

made a struggle to look about him. jacques three was nearly at his side;
madame defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the

exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet
furious dumb-show.

antoineâ€™s blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the
iron hand was down--down on the steps of the hotel de ville where the
governorâ€™s body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of madame defarge

haggard saint antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften
his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with
the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when madame
defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.
madame defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of
spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting
themselves to the saintâ€™s mercies. the lamps across his streets had a
portentously elastic swing with them.

madame defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,
contemplating the wine-shop and the street. in both, there were several
knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense
of power enthroned on their distress.

before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.
the fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that
they could tear. there was a change in the appearance of saint antoine;
the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the
last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.

madame defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was
to be desired in the leader of the saint antoine women. one of her
sisterhood knitted beside her. the short, rather plump wife of a starved
grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had
already earned the complimentary name of the vengeance.

â€œhark!â€ said the vengeance. â€œlisten, then! who comes?â€

as if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of saint antoine
quarter to the wine-shop door, had b

a moment of profound silence followed. defarge and his wife looked
steadfastly at one another. the vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum
was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.

â€œpatriots!â€ said defarge, in a determined voice, â€œare we ready?â€

instantly madame defargeâ€™s knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating
in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and
the vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about
her head like all the forty furies at once, was tearing from house to
house, rousing the women.

the men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked
from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into
the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the bold

under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.

the people immediately behind madame defarge, explaining the cause of
her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to
others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the
clapping of hands. similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,
and the winnowing of many bushels of words, madame defargeâ€™s frequent
expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at
a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some
wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the exter

at length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
protection, directly down upon the old prisonerâ€™s head. the favour was
too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had

face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always
entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of
action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one
another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through
a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
of the fatal lamps swung, and there madame defarge let him go--as a cat
might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him
while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately
screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have
him killed with grass in his mouth. once, he went aloft, and the rope
broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope

â€œwill you accompany me,â€ said mr. lorry, joyfully relieved after reading
this note aloud, â€œto where his wife resides?â€

â€œyes,â€ returned defarge.

scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
way defarge spoke, mr. lorry put on his hat and they went down into the
courtyard. there, they found two women; one, knitting.

â€œmadame defarge, surely!â€ said mr. lorry, who had left her in exactly
the same attitude some seventeen years ago.

â€œit is she,â€ observed her husband.

that was all the writing. it was so much, however, to her who received
it, that she turned from defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the
hands that knitted. it was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took
to its knitting again.

there was something in its touch that gave lucie a check. she stopped in
the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her
neck, looked terrified at madame defarge. madame defarge met the lifted
eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.

â€œmy dear,â€ said mr. lorry, striking in to explain; â€œthere are frequent
risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever
trouble you, madame defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power
to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she
may identify them. i believe,â€ said mr. lorry, rather halting in his
reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the

appeared with folded arms, and observed in english to the vengeance,
whom her eyes first encountered, â€œwell, i am sure, boldface! i hope
_you_ are pretty well!â€ she also bestowed a british cough on madame
defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.

â€œis that his child?â€ said madame defarge, stopping in her work for the
first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little lucie as if it
were the finger of fate.

â€œyes, madame,â€ answered mr. lorry; â€œthis is our poor prisonerâ€™s darling
daughter, and only child.â€

kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. the

but, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and
presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm lucie into saying, as
she laid her appealing hand on madame defargeâ€™s dress:

â€œyou will be good to my poor husband. you will do him no harm. you will
help me to see him if you can?â€

â€œyour husband is not my business here,â€ returned madame defarge, looking
down at her with perfect composure. â€œit is the daughter of your father
who is my business here.â€

â€œfor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. for my childâ€™s sake! she
will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. we are more
afraid of you than of these others.â€

collected his face into a sterner expression.

defarge, with a lowering smile. â€œinfluence; he says something touching
influence?â€

â€œthat my father,â€ said lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her
breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, â€œhas
much influence around him.â€

â€œsurely it will release him!â€ said madame defarge. â€œlet it do so.â€

â€œas a wife and mother,â€ cried lucie, most earnestly, â€œi implore you to
have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against
my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. o sister-woman, think
of me. as a wife and mother!â€

madame defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
turning to her friend the vengeance:

â€œwe have seen nothing else,â€ returned the vengeance.

â€œwe have borne this a long time,â€ said madame defarge, turning her eyes
again upon lucie. â€œjudge you! is it likely that the trouble of one wife

she resumed her knitting and went out. the vengeance followed. defarge

in a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking
lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with
solicitude at her father, doctor manette keeping his eyes fixed on the

said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good
physician of the republic would deserve better still of the republic by
rooting out an obnoxious family of aristocrats, and would doubtless feel
a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an
orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of
human sympathy.

â€œmuch influence around him, has that doctor?â€ murmured madame defarge,
smiling to the vengeance. â€œsave him now, my doctor, save him!â€

there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three, of the
restless fingers and the croaking voice. this man, whom he had seen upon
the jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the
defarges, man and wife. the vengeance assisted in the conversation, like
a regular member of the establishment.

as carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent
french) for a small measure of wine, madame defarge cast a careless
glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced
to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.

he repeated what he had already said.

â€œenglish?â€ asked madame defarge, inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows.

after looking at her, as if the sound of even a single french word were
slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign
accent. â€œyes, madame, yes. i am english!â€

if the axe had dropped.

â€œthe citizeness is superb!â€ croaked the juryman.

â€œshe is an angel!â€ said the vengeance, and embraced her.

â€œas to thee,â€ pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, â€œif it
depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this
man even now.â€

â€œno!â€ protested defarge. â€œnot if to lift this glass would do it! but i
would leave the matter there. i say, stop there.â€

â€œsee you then, jacques,â€ said madame defarge, wrathfully; â€œand see you,
too, my little vengeance; see you both! listen! for other crimes as
tyrants and oppressors, i have this race a long time on my register,
doomed to destruction and extermination. ask my husband, is that so.â€

â€œit is so,â€ assented defarge, without being asked.

hite she was, without seeing

customers entered, and the group was broken up. the english customer
paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as
a stranger, to be directed towards the national palace. madame defarge
took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.
the english customer was not without his reflections then, that it might
be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and
deep.

madame defarge as to his having seen herâ€--he never mentioned lucieâ€™s

xiv. the knitting done


in that same juncture of time when the fifty-two awaited their fate
madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and
jacques three of the revolutionary jury. not in the wine-shop did madame
defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,
erst a mender of roads. the sawyer himself did not participate in the
conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who
was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.

â€œbut our defarge,â€ said jacques three, â€œis undoubtedly a good
republican?

â€œthere is no better,â€ the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill
notes, â€œin france.â€

â€œpeace, little vengeance,â€ said madame defarge, laying her hand with
a slight frown on her lieutenantâ€™s lips, â€œhear me speak. my husband,
fellow-citizen, is a good republican and a bold man; he has deserved
well of the republic, and possesses its confidence. but my husband has
his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor.â€

â€œit is a great pity,â€ croaked jacques three, dubiously shaking his head,
with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; â€œit is not quite like a good
citizen; it is a thing to regret

â€œsee you,â€ said madame, â€œi care nothing for this doctor, i. he may wear
his head or lose it, for any interest i have in him; it is all one to
me. but, the evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and
child must follow the husband and father.â€

â€œshe has a fine head for it,â€ croaked jacques three. â€œi have seen blue
eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when samson held
them up.â€ ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.

madame defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.

â€œthe child also,â€ observed jacques three, with a meditative enjoyment
of his words, â€œhas golden hair and blue eyes. and we seldom have a child
there. it is a pretty sight!â€

â€œin a word,â€ said madame defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,
â€œi cannot trust my husband in this matter. not only do i feel, since
last night, that i dare not confide to him the details of my projects;
but also i feel that if i delay, there is dang

â€œthat must never be,â€ croaked jacques three; â€œno one must escape. we
have not half enough as it is. we ought to have six score a day.â€

â€œin a word,â€ madame defarge went on, â€œmy husband has not my reason for
pursuing this family to annihilation, and i have not his reason for
regarding this doctor with any sensibility. i must act for myself,
therefore. come hither, little citizen.â€

the wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the
submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.

â€œay, ay, why not!â€ cried the sawyer. â€œevery day, in all weathers, from
two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes
without. i know what i know. i have seen with my eyes.â€

he made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
never seen.

â€œclearly plots,â€ said jacques three. â€œtransparently!â€

â€œthere is no doubt of the jury?â€ inquired madame defarge, letting her
eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.

â€œrely upon the patriotic jury, dear citizeness. i answer for my
fellow-jurymen.â€

â€œnow, let me see,â€ said madame defarge, pondering again. â€œyet once more!
can i spare this doctor to my husband? i have no feeling either way. can
i spare him?â€

â€œhe would count as one head,â€ observed jacques three, in a low voice.
â€œwe really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, i think.â€

â€œhe was signalling with her when i

 saw her,â€ argued madame defarge; â€œi
cannot speak of one without the other; and i must not be silent, and
trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. for, i am not a
bad witness.â€

the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses. the little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a
celestial witness.

â€œhe must take his chance,â€ said madame defarge. â€œno, i cannot spare
him! you are engaged at three oâ€™clock; you are going to see the batch of
to-day executed.--you?â€

the question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in
the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
of republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
barber. he wa

suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at

over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in saint antoine, and we
will give information against these people at my section.â€

citizeness. the citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded

retreated among his wood, and
hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.

madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer to
the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:

â€œshe will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. she will
be mourning and grieving. she will be in a state of mind to impeach the
justice of the republic. she will be full of sympathy with its enemies.

embraced her.

â€œtake you my knitting,â€ said madame defarge, placing it in her
lieutenantâ€™s hands, â€œand have it ready for me in my usual seat. keep
me my usual chair. go you there, straight, for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual, to-day.â€

â€œi willingly obey the orders of my chief,â€ said the vengeance with
alacrity, and kissing her cheek. â€œyou will not be late?â€

â€œi shall be there before the commencement.â€

â€œand before the tumbrils arrive. be sure you are there, my soul,â€ said
the vengeance, calling af

ter her, for she had already turned into the
street, â€œbefore the tumbrils arrive!â€

madame defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the
mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. the vengeance and the
juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative
of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.

there were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman, now

use they were her natural enemies and
her prey, and as such had no right to live. to appeal to her, was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. if she had
been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had
been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent her there.

such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe. carelessly
worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her
dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. lying hidden in her
bosom, was a loaded pistol. lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened
dagger. thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such
a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown
sea-sand, madame defarge took her way a

of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.

seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency, miss pross hailed it with joy. she and jerry had
beheld the coach start, had known who it was that solomon brought, had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach, even as madame defarge,
taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the
else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.

â€œnow what do you think, mr. cruncher,â€ said miss pross, whose agitation
was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:
â€œwhat do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? another
carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken
suspicion.â€

â€œmy opinion, miss,â€ returned mr. cruncher, â€œis as youâ€™

conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.

and still madame defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
nearer and nearer.

which were swollen and red. haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she
could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her. in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.

the basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of
madame defarge. by strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,
those feet had come to meet that water.

madame defarge looked coldly at her, and said, â€œthe wife of evremonde;
where is she?â€

it flashed upon miss prossâ€™s mind that the doors were all standing open,
and would suggest the flight. her first act was to shut them. there were
four in the room, and she shut them all. she then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied.

madame defargeâ€™s dark eyes

 followed her through this rapid movement,
and rested on her when it was finished. miss pross had nothing beautiful
about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,
of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different
way, and she measured madame defarge with her eyes, every inch.

â€œyou might, from your appearance, be the wife of lucifer,â€ said miss
pross, in her breathing. â€œnevertheless, you shall not get the better of
me. i am an englishwoman.â€

madame defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of
miss prossâ€™s own perception that they two were at bay. she saw a tight,
hard, wiry woman before her, as mr. lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. she knew full well tha

miss pross was the familyâ€™s devoted friend; miss pross knew full well
that madame defarge was the familyâ€™s malevolent enemy.

â€œon my way yonder,â€ said madame defarge, with a slight movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot, â€œwhere they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me, i am come to make my compliments to her in passing. i
wish to see her.â€

â€œi know that your intentions are evil,â€ said miss pross, â€œand you may
depend upon it, iâ€™ll hold my own against them.â€

each spoke in her own language; neither understood the otherâ€™s words;
both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what
the unintelligible words

meant.

â€œit will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment,â€ said madame defarge. â€œgood patriots will know what that means.
let me see her. go tell her that i wish to see her. do you hear?â€

â€œif those eyes of yours were bed-winches,â€ returned miss pross, â€œand i
was an english four-poster, they shouldnâ€™t loose a splinter of me. no,
you wicked foreign woman; i am your match.â€

madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught.

â€œwoman imbecile and pig-like!â€ said madame defarge, frowning. â€œi take no
answer from you. i demand to see her. either tell her that i demand
to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!â€
 this, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.

â€œi little thought,â€ said miss pross, â€œthat i should ever want to

laughed, â€œyou poor wretch! what are you worth! i address myself to that
doctor.â€ then she raised her voice and called out, â€œcitizen doctor! wife
of evremonde! child of evremonde! any person but this miserable fool,
answer the citizeness defarge!â€

perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of miss prossâ€™s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion, whispered to madame defarge that they were gone.
three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.

â€œthose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there
are odds and ends upon the ground. there is no one in that room behind
you! let me look.â€

â€œnever!â€ said miss pross, who understood the request as perfectly as
madame defarge understood the answer.

â€œif they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and
brought back,â€ said madame defarge to herself.

â€œas long

 as you donâ€™t know whether they are in that room or not, you are
uncertain what to do,â€ said miss pross to herself; â€œand you shall not
know that, if i can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know
that, you shall not leave here while i can hold you.â€

â€œi have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,
i will tear you to pieces, but i will have you from that door,â€ said
madame defarge.

â€œwe are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are
not likely to be heard, and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here,
while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
my darling,â€ said miss pross.

madame defarge made at the door. miss pross, on the instinct of the
moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.
it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike; miss pross,
with the vigorous ten

acity of love, always so much stronger than hate,
clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had. the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her
face; but, miss pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.

soon, madame defargeâ€™s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled
waist. â€œit is under my arm,â€ said miss pross, in smothered tones, â€œyou
shall not draw it. i am stronger than you, i bless heaven for it. i hold
you till one or other of us faints or dies!â€

madame defargeâ€™s hands were at her bosom. miss pross looked up, saw
what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood
alone--blinded with smoke.

all this was in a second. as the smoke cleared, leaving an awful
