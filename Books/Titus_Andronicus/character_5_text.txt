   tit. tribunes i thanke you, and this sure i make,
that you create your emperours eldest sonne,

crowne him, and say: long liue our emperour

  satu. titus andronicus, for thy fauours done,

shee is a woman, therefore may be woo'd,
shee is a woman, therfore may be wonne,
shee is lauinia therefore must be lou'd.
what man, more water glideth by the mill
then wots the miller of, and easie it is

though bassianus be the emperours brother,
better then he haue worne vulcans badge

what hast not thou full often strucke a doe,
and borne her cleanly by the keepers nose?
