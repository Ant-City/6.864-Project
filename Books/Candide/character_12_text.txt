 to a jew, named don issachar, who traded to holland and portugal, and had a strong passion for women. this jew was much attached to my person, but could not triumph over it; i resisted him better than the bulgarian soldier. a modest woman may be ravished once, but her virtue is strengthened by it. in order to render me more tractable, he brought me to this country house. hitherto i had imagined that nothing could equal the beauty of thunder-ten-tronckh castle; but i found i was mistaken.

"the grand inquisitor, seeing me one day at mass, stared long at me, and sent to tell me that he wished to speak on private matters. i was conducted to his palace, where i acquainted him with the history of my family, and he represented to me how much it was beneath my rank[pg 32] to belong to an israelite. a proposal was then made to don issachar that he should resign me to my lord. don issachar, being the court banker, and a man of credit, would hear nothing of it. the inquisitor threatened him with an auto-da-f√©

"agitated, lost, sometimes beside myself, and sometimes ready to die of weakness, my mind was filled with the massacre of my father, mother, and brother, with the insolence of the ugly bulgarian soldier, with the stab that he gave me, with my servitude under the bulgarian captain, with my hideous don issachar, with my abominable inquisitor, with the execution of doctor p

they both sat down to table, and, when supper was over, they placed themselves once more on the sofa; where they were when signor don issachar arrived. it was the jewish sabbath, and issachar had come to enjoy his rights, and to explain his tender love.[pg 35]

what became of cunegonde, candide, the grand inquisitor, and the jew.

this issachar was the most choleric hebrew that had ever been seen in israel since the captivity in babylon.

"what!" said he, "thou bitch of a galilean, was not the inquisitor enough for thee? must this rascal also share with me?"

in saying this he drew a long poniard which he always carried about him; and not imagining that his adversary had any arms he threw himself upon candide: but our honest westphalian had received a handsome sword from the old woman along with the suit o

native tribes in the neighborhood of san sacrament revolt against the kings of spain and portugal. candide having been in the bulgarian service, performed the military exercise before the general of this little army with so graceful an address, with so intrepid an air, and with such agility and expedition, that he was given the command of a company of foot. now, he was a captain! he set sail with miss cunegonde, the old woman, two valets, and the two andalusian horses, which had belonged to the grand inquisitor of portugal.

during their voyage they reasoned a good deal on the philosophy of poor pangloss.

"we are going into another world," said candide; "and surely it must be there that all is for the best. for i must confess there is reason to complain a little of what passeth in[pg 40] our world in regard to both natural and moral philosophy."

"i love you with all my heart," said cunegonde; "but my soul is still full of fright at that which i have seen and experienced."

while the old woman spoke with all the prudence which age and experience gave, a small ship entered the port on board of which were an alcalde and his alguazils, and this was what had happened.

as the old woman had shrewdly guessed, it was a grey friar who stole cunegonde's money and jewels in the town of badajos, when she and candide were escaping. the friar wanted to sell some of the diamonds to a jeweller; the jeweller knew them to be the grand inquisitor's. the friar before he was hanged confessed he had stolen them. he described the persons, and the route they had taken. the flight of cunegonde[pg 57] and candide was already known. they were traced to cadiz. a vessel was immediately sent in pursuit of them. the vessel was already in the port of buenos ayres. the report spread that the alcalde was going to land, and that he was in pursuit of the murderers of my lord the grand inquisitor. the prudent old woman saw at once what was to be done.
