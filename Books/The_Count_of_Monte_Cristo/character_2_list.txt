Lord Wilmore - 
                    The
identity of an eccentric English nobleman that Dantes assumes when
committing acts of random generosity. Lord Wilmore contrasts sharply
with Monte Cristo, who is associated with Dantes's acts of bitterness
and cruelty. Appropriately, Monte Cristo cites Lord Wilmore as one
of his enemies.
