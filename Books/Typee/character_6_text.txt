ngine concealed within her
body which kept her in perpetual motion.

never suppose that she was a termagant or a shrew for all this; she had
the kindliest heart in the world, and acted towards me in particular
in a truly maternal manner, occasionally putting some little morsel of
choice food into my hand, some outlandish kind of savage sweetmeat or
pastry, like a doting mother petting a sickly urchin with tarts
and sugar plums. warm indeed are my remembrances of the dear, good,
affectionate old tinor!

besides the individuals i have mentioned, there belonged to the
household three young men, dissipated, good-for-nothing, roystering
blades of savages, who were either employed in prosecuting love affairs
with the maidens of the tribe, or grew boozy on ‘arva’ and tobacco in
the company of congenial spirits, the scapegraces of the valley.

among the permanent inmates of the house were likewise several lovely
damsels, who instead of thrumming pianos and reading novels, like

in a few moments toby revived, and opening his eyes for a second--closed
them again without speaking. kory-kory, who had been kneeling beside me,
now chafed his limbs gently with the palms of his hands, while a young
girl at his head kept fanning him, and i still continued to moisten his
lips and brow. soon my poor comrade showed signs of animation, and i
succeeded in making him swallow from a cocoanut shell a few mouthfuls of
water.

old tinor now appeared, holding in her hand some simples she had
gathered, the juice of which she by signs besought me to squeeze into
the wound. having done so, i thought it best to leave toby undisturbed
until he should have had time to rally his faculties. several times he
opened his lips, but fearful for his safety i enjoined silence. in the
course of two or three hours, however, he sat up, and was sufficiently
recovered to tell me what had occurred.

in the course of a few days toby had recovered from the effects of
his adventure with the happar warriors; the wound on his head rapidly
healing under the vegetable treatment of the good tinor. less fortunate
than my companion however, i still continued to languish under a
complaint, the origin and nature of which were still a mystery. cut off
as i was from all intercourse with the civilized world, and feeling the
inefficacy of anything the natives could do to relieve me; knowing,
too, that so long as i remained in my present condition, it would
be impossible for me to leave the valley, whatever opportunity might
present itself; and apprehensive that ere long we might be exposed to

that were left.

towards sunset the islanders in small parties began to return from
the beach, and among them, as they drew near to the house, i sought to
descry the form of my companion. but one after another they passed the
dwelling, and i caught no glimpse of him. supposing, however, that he
would soon appear with some of the members of the household, i quieted
my apprehensions, and waited patiently to see him advancing in company
with the beautiful fayaway. at last, i perceived tinor coming forward,
followed by the girls and young men who usually resided in the house of
marheyo; but with them came not my comrade, and, filled with a thousand
alarms, i eagerly sought to discover the cause of his delay.

my earnest questions appeared to embarrass the natives greatly. all
their accounts were contradictory: one giving me to understand that
toby would be with me in a very short time; another that he did not know
where he was; while a third, violently inveighing, against him, assu

disappearance of toby were enough
of themselves to excite distrust with regard to the savages, in whose
power i felt myself to be entirely placed, especially when it was
combined with the knowledge that these very men, kind and respectful
as they were to me, were, after all, nothing better than a set of
cannibals.

but my chief source of anxiety, and that which poisoned every temporary
enjoyment, was the mysterious disease in my leg, which still remained
unabated. all the herbal applications of tinor, united with the severer
discipline of the old leech, and the affectionate nursing of kory-kory,
had failed to relieve me. i was almost a cripple, and the pain i endured
at intervals was agonizing. the unaccountable malady showed no signs
of amendment: on the contrary, its violence increased day by day, and
threatened the most fatal results, unless some powerful means were
employed to counteract it. it seemed as if i were destined to sink
under this grievous affliction, or at least that it woul

could not have felt greater indignation than i did at this unexpected
slight.

i was thrown into utter astonishment. the conduct of the savages had
prepared me to anticipate from every newcomer the same extravagant
expressions of curiosity and regard. the singularity of his conduct,
however, only roused my desire to discover who this remarkable personage
might be, who now engrossed the attention of every one.

tinor placed before him a calabash of poee-poee, from which the stranger
regaled himself, alternating every mouthful with some rapid exclamation,
which was eagerly caught up and echoed by the crowd that completely
filled the house. when i observed the striking devotion of the natives
to him, and their temporary withdrawal of all attention from myself, i
felt not a little piqued. the glory of tommo is departed, thought i, and
the sooner he removes from the valley the better. these were my feelings

ree, as he abundantly evinced by the use
to which he put those sorely bruised and battered old shoes.

every article, however trivial, which belonged to me, the natives
appeared to regard as sacred; and i observed that for several days
after becoming an inmate of the house, my pumps were suffered to remain,
untouched, where i had first happened to throw them. i remembered,
however, that after awhile i had missed them from their accustomed
place; but the matter gave me no concern, supposing that tinor--like any
other tidy housewife, having come across them in some of her domestic
occupations--had pitched the useless things out of the house. but i was
soon undeceived.

one day i observed old marheyo bustling about me with unusual activity,
and to such a degree as almost to supersede kory-kory in the functions
of his office. one moment he volunteered to trot off with me on his back
to the stream; and when i refused, noways daunted by the repulse, he
continued to frisk about me like a superannu

s golden spikes above the happar mountain, ere i threw
aside my tappa robe, and girding my long tunic about my waist, sallied
out with fayaway and kory-kory, and the rest of the household, and bent
my steps towards the stream. here we found congregated all those who
dwelt in our section of the valley; and here we bathed with them. the
fresh morning air and the cool flowing waters put both soul and body in
a glow, and after a half-hour employed in this recreation, we sauntered
back to the house--tinor and marheyo gathering dry sticks by the way
for fire-wood; some of the young men laying the cocoanut trees under
contribution as they passed beneath them; while kory-kory played his
outlandish pranks for my particular diversion, and fayaway and i, not
arm in arm to be sure, but sometimes hand in hand, strolled along, with
feelings of perfect charity for all the world, and especial good-will
towards each other.

our morning meal was soon prepared. the islanders are somewhat

past; reserving the more powerful efforts of
their appetite to a later period of the day. for my own part, with the
assistance of my valet, who, as i have before stated, always officiated
as spoon on these occasions, i ate sparingly from one of tinor’s
trenchers, of poee-poee; which was devoted exclusively for my own use,
being mixed with the milky meat of ripe cocoanut. a section of a roasted
bread-fruit, a small cake of ‘amar’, or a mess of ‘cokoo,’ two or three
bananas, or a mammee-apple; an annuee, or some other agreeable and
nutritious fruit served from day to day to diversify the meal, which was
finished by tossing off the liquid contents of a young cocoanut or two.

while partaking of this simple repast, the inmates of marh

 meal was concluded, pipes were lighted; and among them
my own especial pipe, a present from the noble mehevi.

the islanders, who only smoke a whiff or two at a time, and at long
intervals, and who keep their pipes going from hand to hand continually,
regarded my systematic smoking of four or five pipefuls of tobacco in
succession, as something quite wonderful. when two or three pipes had
circulated freely, the company gradually broke up. marheyo went to the
little hut he was forever building. tinor began to inspect her rolls of
tappa, or employed her busy fingers in plaiting grass-mats. the girls
anointed themselves with their fragrant oils, dressed their hair, or
looked over their curious finery, and compared together their ivory
trinkets, fashioned out of boar’s tusks or whale’s teeth. the young men
and warriors produced their spears, paddles, canoe-gear, battle-clubs,
and war-conchs, and occupied themselves in carving, all sorts of figures
upon them with pointed bits of shell or fl

if a hostile attitude will secure his lovely domain from the remorseless

previously to seeing the dancing widows i had little idea that there
were any matrimonial relations subsisting in typee, and i should as soon
have thought of a platonic affection being cultivated between the sexes,
as of the solemn connection of man and wife. to be sure, there were old
marheyo and tinor, who seemed to have a sort of nuptial understanding
with one another; but for all that, i had sometimes observed a
comical-looking old gentleman dressed in a suit of shabby tattooing, who
had the audacity to take various liberties with the lady, and that too
in the very presence of the old warrior her husband, who looked on
as good-naturedly as if nothing was happening. this behaviour, until
subsequent discoveries enlightened me, puzzled me more than anything
else i witnessed in typee.

as for

e been the owner of that grove of bread-fruit trees,
or of these gloriously yellow bunches of bananas.

from what i have said it will be perceived that there is a vast
difference between ‘personal property’ and ‘real estate’ in the valley
of typee. some individuals, of course, are more wealthy than others.
for example, the ridge-pole of marheyo’s house bends under the weight of
many a huge packet of tappa; his long couch is laid with mats placed one
upon the other seven deep. outside, tinor has ranged along in her
bamboo cupboard--or whatever the place may be called--a goodly array of
calabashes and wooden trenchers. now, the house just beyond the grove,
and next to marheyo’s, occupied by ruaruga, is not quite so well
furnished. there are only three moderate-sized packages swinging
overhead: there are only two layers of mats beneath; and the calabashes
and trenchers are not so numerous, nor so tastefully stained and carved.
but then, ruaruga has a house--not so pretty a one, to

posited upon the ground; but although i had no doubt as to their
contents, still their thick coverings prevented my actually detecting
the form of a human body.

the next morning, shortly after sunrise, the same thundering sounds
which had awakened me from sleep on the second day of the feast of
calabashes, assured me that the savages were on the eve of celebrating
another, and, as i fully believed, a horrible solemnity.

all the inmates of the house, with the exception of marheyo, his son,
and tinor, after assuming their gala dresses, departed in the direction
of the taboo groves.

although i did not anticipate a compliance with my request, still, with
a view of testing the truth of my suspicions, i proposed to kory-kory
that, according to our usual custom in the morning, we should take a
stroll to the ti: he positively refused; and when i renewed the request,
he evinced his determination to prevent my going there; and, to divert
my mind from the subject, he offered to accompany me to the

yful welcome to
my long-lost comrade; but now that it was known he had not arrived they
would at once oblige me to turn back.

my anticipations were but too correct. in spite of the resistance i
made, they carried me into a house which was near the spot, and left me
upon the mats. shortly afterwards several of those who had accompanied
me from the ti, detaching themselves from the others, proceeded in
the direction of the sea. those who remained--among whom were marheyo,
mow-mow, kory-kory, and tinor--gathered about the dwelling, and appeared
to be awaiting their return.

this convinced me that strangers--perhaps some of my own countrymen--had
for some cause or other entered the bay. distracted at the idea of their
vicinity, and reckless of the pain which i suffered, i heeded not the
assurances of the islanders, that there were no boats at the beach, but
starting to my feet endeavoured to gain the door. instantly the passage
was blocked up by several men, who commanded me to resume my seat.

hind the rest. ‘nukuheva is far off, and
i cannot cross the happar country by night. you see how it is;--if you
come along with me, all will be well; if you do not, depend upon it,
neither of you will ever escape.’

‘there is no help for it,’ said toby, at last, with a heavy heart, ‘i
will have to trust you,’ and he came out from the shadow of the little
shrine, and cast a long look up the valley.

‘now keep close to my side,’ said the sailor, ‘and let us be moving
quickly.’ tinor and fayaway here appeared; the kindhearted old woman
embracing toby’s knees, and giving way to a flood of tears; while
fayaway, hardly less moved, spoke some few words of english she had
learned, and held up three fingers before him--in so many days he would
return.

at last jimmy pulled toby out of the crowd, and after calling to a
young typee who was standing by with a young pig in his arms, all three
started for the mountains.

‘i have told them that you are coming back again,’ said th
