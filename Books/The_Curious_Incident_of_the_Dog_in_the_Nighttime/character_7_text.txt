llen over. i decided that the dog was probably killed 
with the fork because i could not see any other wounds in the dog and i do not think you would stick a 
garden fork into a dog after it had died for some other reason, like cancer, for example, or a road accident. 
but i could not be certain about this. 
 
i went through mrs. shears's gate, closing it behind me. i walked onto her lawn and knelt beside the dog. 
i put my hand on the muzzle of the dog. it was still warm. 
 
the dog was called wellington. it belonged to mrs. shears, who was our friend. she lived on the opposite 
side of the road, two houses to the left. 
 
wellington was a poodle. not one of the small poodles that have hairstyles but a big poodle. it had curly 
black fur, but when you got close you could see that the skin underneath the fur was a very pale yellow, 
like chicken. 
 
i stroked wellington and wondered who had killed him, and why.

sunlight  on  a  piece  of  my  clothing  and  start  a  fire.  i  would  then  make  my  escape  when  they  saw  the 
smoke and took me out of the cell. and if they didn't notice i would be able to wee on the clothes and put 
them out. 

 
i wondered whether mrs. shears had told the police that i had killed wellington and whether, when the 
police  found  out  that  she  had  lied,  she  would  go  to  prison.  because  telling  lies  about  people  is  called 
slander.

i said, "i'm sorry," because father had had to come to the police station, which was a bad thing. 
 
he said, "it's ok." 
 
i said, "i didn't kill the dog." 
 
and he said, "i know." 
 
then he said, "christopher, you have to stay out of trouble, ok?" 
 
i said, "i didn't know i was going to get into trouble. i like wellington and i went to say hello to him, but 
i didn't know that someone had killed him." 
 
father said, "just try and keep your nose out of other people's business." 
 
i thought for a little and i said, "i am going to find out who killed wellington." 
 
and father said, "were you listening to what i was saying, christopher?"

out who did it so that they can be punished."

at 2:07 a.m. i decided that i wanted a drink of orange squash before i brushed my teeth and got into bed, 
so i went downstairs to the kitchen. father was sitting on the sofa watching snooker on the television and 
drinking scotch. there were tears coming out of his eyes. 
 
i asked, "are you sad about wellington?" 
 
he looked at me for a long time and sucked air in through his nose. then he said, "yes, christopher, you 
could say that. you could very well say that." 

 
i decided to leave him alone because when i am sad i want to be left alone. so i didn't say anything else. i

in the bus on the way to school next morning we passed 4 red cars in a row, which meant that it was a 
good day, so i decided not to be sad about wellington. 
 
mr. jeavons, the psychologist at the school, once asked me why 4 red cars in a row made it a good day, 
and 3 red cars in a row made it a quite good day, and 5 red cars in a row made it a super good day, 
and why 4 yellow cars in a row made it a black day, which is a day when i don't speak to anyone and sit 
on  my own reading books and don't eat  my lunch and take no risks. he said that i was clearly a very 
logical person, so he was surprised that i should think like this because it wasn'

terry has a tattoo on his arm of a heart shape with a knife through the middle of it. 
 
but this is what is called a digression, and now i am going to go back to the fact that it was a good day. 
 
because it was a good day i decided that i would try and find out who killed wellington because a good 
day is a day for projects and planning things. 
 
when  i  said  this  to  siobhan  she  said,  "well, we're  meant  to  be  writing  stories  today,  so  why  don't  you 
write about finding wellington and going to the police station."

i decided that i was going to find out who killed wellington even though father had told me to stay out of 
other people's business. 
 
this is because i do not always do what i am told. 
 
and this is because when people tell you what to do it is usually confusing and does not make sense. 
 
for example, people often say "be quiet," but they don't tell you how long to be quiet for. or you see a 
sign  which  says  keep  off  the  grass  but  it  should  say  keep  off  the  grass  around 
this sign or keep off all the grass in this park because there is

when she opened the door she was holding a mug of tea and she was wearing sheepskin slippers and she 
had been watching a quiz program  on the television because there was  a television on and i could hear 
someone  saying,  "the  capital  city  of  venezuela  is...  (a)  maracas,  (b)  caracas,  (c)  bogota  or  (d) 
georgetown." and i knew that it was caracas. 
 
she said, "christopher, i really don't think i want to see you right now." 
 
i said, "i didn't kill wellington." 
 
and she replied, "what are you doing here?" 
 

i said, "i wanted to come and tell you that i didn't kill wellington. and also i want to find out who killed 
him." 
 
some of her tea spilled onto the carpet. 
 
i said, "do you know who killed wellington?" 
 
she didn't answer my question. she just said, "goodbye, christopher," and closed the door. 
 
then i decided to do some detective work. 
 
i could see that she was watching me and waiting for me to leave because i could see her standi

was  no  one  watching  and  climbed  over  the  wall  and  walked  down  the  side  of  the  house  into  her  back 
garden to the shed where she kept all her gardening tools. 
 
the shed was locked with a padlock and i couldn't go inside so i walked round to the window in the side. 
then i had some good luck. when i looked through the window i could see a fork that looked exactly the 
same as the fork that had been sticking out of wellington. it was lying on the bench by the window and it 
had been cleaned because there was no blood on the spikes. i could see some other tools as well, a spade 
and a rake and one of those long clippers people use for cutting branches which are too high to reach. and 
they  all  had  the  same  green  plastic  handles  like  the  fork.  this  meant  that  the  fork  belonged  to  mrs. 
shears. either that or it was a red herring, which is a clue which makes you come to a wrong conclusion 
or somethin

i  wondered  if  mrs.  shears  had  killed  wellington  herself.  but  if  she  had  killed  wellington  herself,  why 
had she come out of the house shouting, "what in fuck's name have you done to my dog?" 
 
i  thought  that  mrs.  shears  probably  didn't  kill  wellington.  but  whoever  had  killed  him  had  probably 
killed him with mrs. shears's fork. and the shed was locked. this meant that it was someone who had the 
key to mrs. shears's shed, or that she had left it unlocked, or that she had left her fork lying around in the 
garden. 
 
i heard a noise and turned round and saw mrs. shears standing on the lawn looking at me. 
 
i said, "i came to see if the fork was in the shed." 
 
and she said, "if you don't go now i will call the police again."

 not  much  to  do  on  a  saturday  unless  father  takes  me  out 
somewhere on an outing to the boating lake or to the garden center, but on this saturday england were 
playing  romania  at  football,  which  meant  that  we  weren't  going  to  go  on  an  outing  because  father 
wanted to watch the match on the television. so i decided to do some more detection on my own. 
 
i decided that i would go and ask some of the other people who lived in our street if they had seen anyone 
killing wellington or whether they had seen anything strange happening in the street on thursday night. 
 
talking to strangers is not something i usually do. i do not like talking to strangers. this is not because of 
stranger danger, which they tell us about at school, which is where a strange man offers you sweets or a 
ride in his car because he wants to do sex with you. i am not worried about that. if a strange man touched 
me i would hit him, and i can hit people very hard. for example, when i punched sarah

then i made sure i had my swiss army knife in my pocket and i went out and i knocked on the door of 
number 40, which is opposite mrs. shears's house, which means that they were most likely to have seen 
something. the people who live at number 40 are called thompson. 

 

mr. thompson answered the door. he was wearing a t-shirt which said  

beer  

helping ugly people have sex  
for 2,000 years 

mr. thompson said, "can i help you?" 

i said, "do you know who killed wellington?" 

i did not look at his face. i do not like looking at people's faces, especially if they are strangers. he did 
not say anything for a few seconds. 

then he said, "who are you?" 

i said, "i'm christopher boone from number 36 and i know you. you're mr. thompson." 

he said, "i'm mr. thompson's brother." 

i said, "do you know who killed wellington?" 

he said, "who the fuck is wellington?" 

i said, "mrs. shears's dog. mrs. shears is from number 41." 

he said, "someone killed her dog?" 

i

 said, "with a fork." 

he said, "jesus christ." 

i said, "a garden fork," in case he thought i meant a fork you eat your food with. then i said, "do you 
know who killed him?" 

he said, "i haven't a bloody clue." 

i said, "did you see anything suspicious on thursday evening?" 

he said, "look, son, do you really think you should be going around asking questions like this?" 

and i said, "yes, because i want to find out who killed wellington, and i am writing a book about it." 

and he said, "well, i was in colchester on thursday, so you're asking the wrong bloke." 

i said, "thank you," and i walked away. 

there was no answer at house number 42. 
 
i had seen the people who lived at number 44, but i did not know what their names were. they were black 
people and they were a man and a lady with two children, a boy and a girl. the lady answered the door. 
she  was  wearing  boots  which  looked  like  army  boots  and  there  were

  5  bracelets  made  out  of  a  silver-
colored metal on her wrist and they made a jangling noise. she said, "it's christopher, isn't it." 
 
i said that it was, and i asked her if she knew who killed wellington. she knew who wellington was so i 
didn't have to explain, and she had heard about him being killed. 
 
i asked if she had seen anything suspicious on thursday evening which might be a clue. 
 
she said, "like what?" 
 
and i said, "like strangers. or like the sound of people arguing." 
 
but she said she hadn't. 
 
and  then  i  decided  to  do  what  is  called  trying  a  different  tack,  and  i  asked  her  whether  she  knew  of 
anyone who might want to make mrs. shears sad. 
 
and she said, "perhaps you should

the people who live at number 43 are mr. wise and mr. wise's mother, who is in a wheelchair, which is 
why he lives with her, so he can take her to the shops and drive her around. 
 
it  was  mr.  wise  who  answered  the  door.  he  smelled  of  body  odor  and  old  biscuits  and  off  popcorn, 
which is what you smell of if you haven't washed for a very long time, like jason at school smells because 
his family is poor. 
 
i asked mr. wise if he knew who had killed wellington on thursday night. 
 
he said, "bloody hell, policemen really are getting younger, aren't they." 
 
then he laughed. i do not like people laughing at me, so i turned and walked away. 
 

i did not knock at the door of number 38, which is the house next to our house, because the people there 
take drugs and father says that i should never talk to them, so i don't. and they play loud music at night 
and they make me scared sometimes when i see them in the street. and it is not really their house

her name is mrs. alexander. she has a dog. it is a dachshund, so she was probably a good person because 
she liked dogs. but the dog wasn't in the garden with her. it was inside the house. 
 
mrs. alexander was wearing jeans and training shoes, which old people don't normally wear. and there 
was mud on the jeans. and the trainers were new balance trainers. and the laces were red. 
 
i went up to mrs. alexander and said, "do you know anything about wellington being killed?" 
 
then she turned the electric hedge trimmer off and said, "i'm afraid you're going to have to say that again. 
i'm a little deaf." 
 
so i said, "do you know anything about wellington being killed?" 
 
and she said, "i heard about it yesterday. dreadful. dreadful." 
 
i said, "do you know who killed him?" 
 
and she said, "no, i don't." 
 
i  replied,  "somebody  must  know  because  the  person  who  killed  wellington  knows  that  they  killed

was inside the house for more than 6 minutes and i began to get nervous because i didn't know what she 
was doing in the house. i didn't know her well enough to know whether she was telling the truth about 
getting orange squash and battenberg cake. and i thought she might be ringing the police and then i'd get 
into much more serious trouble because of the caution. 
 
so i walked away. 
 
and as i was crossing the street i had a stroke of inspiration about who might have killed wellington. i 
was imagining a chain of reasoning inside my head which was like this 

1. why would you kill a dog? 
   a) because you hated the dog. 
   b) because you were mad. 
   c) because you wanted to make mrs. shears upset. 
2. i didn't know anyone who hated wellington, so if it was (a) it was probably a stranger. 
3. i didn't know any mad people, so if it was (b) it was also probably a stranger. 
4. most murders are committed by someone who is known to the victim. in fact, you are most likely 
to

  be  murdered  by  a  member  of  your  own  family  on  christmas  day.  this  is  a  fact.  wellington  was 
therefore most likely to have been killed by someone known to him. 

5. if it was (c) i only knew one person who didn't like mrs. shears, and that was mr. shears, who 

knew wellington very well indeed. 
 
 
this meant that mr. shears was my prime suspect. 
 
mr.  shears  used  to  be  married  to  mrs.  shears  and  they  lived  together  until  two  years  ago.  then  mr. 
shears  left  and  didn't  come  back.  this  was  why  mrs.  shears  came  over  and  did  lots  of  cooking  for  us 
after mother died, because she didn't have to cook for mr. shears anymore and she didn't have to stay at 
home and be his wife. and also father said that she needed company and didn't wa

father said, "i have just had a phone call from mrs. shears." 
 
i started eating my baked beans and broccoli and two slices of ham. 
 
then father asked, "what the hell were you doing poking round her garden?" 
 
i said, "i was doing detective work trying to find out who killed wellington." 
 
father replied, "how many times do i have to tell you, christopher?" 
 
the baked beans and the broccoli and the ham were cold but i didn't mind this. i eat very slowly so my 
food is nearly always cold. 
 
father said, "i told you to keep your nose out of other people's business." 
 
i said, "i think mr. shears probably killed wellington." 
 
father didn't say anything. 
 
i  said,  "he  is  my  prime  suspect.  because  i  think  someone  might  have  killed  wellington  to  make  mrs.

father banged the table with his fist really hard so that the plates and his knife and fork jumped around 
and  my  ham  jumped  sideways  so  that  it  touched  the  broccoli,  so  i  couldn't  eat  the  ham  or  the  broccoli 
anymore. 
 
then he shouted, "i will not have that man's name mentioned in my house." 
 
i asked, "why not?" 
 
and he said, "that man is evil." 
 
and i said, "does that mean he might have killed wellington?" 
 
father put his head in his hands and said, "jesus wept." 

 
i  could  see  that  father  was  angry with  me,  so  i said,  "i know you  told  me  not  to  get  involved  in  other 
people's business but mrs. shears is a friend of ours." 
 
and father said, "well, she's not a friend anymore." 
 
and i asked, "why not?" 
 
and father said, "ok, christopher. i am going to say this for the last and final time. i will not tell you 
again. look at  me when i'm talking to you, for god's sake.

book was really good as it was and that i should be very proud of having written a book at all, even if it 
was  quite  short  and  there  were  some  very  good  books  which  were  very  short  like  heart  of  darkness, 
which was by conrad. 
 
but i said that it wasn't a proper book because it didn't have a proper ending because i never found out 
who killed wellington so the murderer was still at large. 
 
and she said that was like life, and not all murders were solved and not all murderers were caught. like 
jack the ripper. 
i said i didn't like the idea that the murderer was still at large. i said i didn't like to think that the person 
who  killed  wellington  could  be  living  somewhere  nearby  and  i  might  meet  him  when  i  went  out  for  a 
walk  at  night.  and  this  was  possible  because  a  murder  was  usually  committed  by  a  person

then i said, "father said i was never to mention mr. shears's name in our house again and that he was an

and she said, "perhaps your father just doesn't like mr. shears very much." 
 
and i asked, "why?" 
 
and she said, "i don't know, christopher. i don't know because i don't know anything about mr. shears." 
 
i said, "mr. shears used to be married to mrs. shears and he left her, like in a divorce. but i don't know if 
they were actually divorced."

she said, "what happened to you the other day?" 
 
i asked, "which day?" 
 
and she said, "i came out again and you'd gone. i had to eat all the biscuits myself." 
 
i said, "i went away." 
 
and she said, "i gathered that." 
 
i said, "i thought you might ring the police." 
 
and she said, "why on earth would i do that?" 
 
and  i  said,  "because  i  was  poking  my  nose  into  other  people's  business  and  father  said  i  shouldn't 
investigate who killed wellington. and a policeman gave me a caution and if i get into trouble again it 
will be a lot worse because of the caution." 
 
then the indian lady behind the counter said to mrs. alexander, "can i help you?" and mrs. alexander 
said she'd like a pint of milk and a packet of jaffa cakes and i went out of the shop. 
 
when i was outside the shop i saw that mrs. alexander's dachshund was sitting on the pavement. it was 
wearing a little coat made out of tartan material, which is scottish and check. she h

then she untied ivor's lead from the drainpipe. 
 
i wasn't going to say anything because i didn't want to get into trouble. 
 
then  i  thought  that  this  was  a  super  good  day  and  something  special  hadn't  happened  yet,  so  it  was 
possible that talking to mrs. alexander was the special thing that was going to happen. and i thought that 
she  might  tell  me  something  about  wellington  or  about  mr.  shears  without  me  asking  her,  so  that 
wouldn't be breaking my promise. 
 
so i said, "and i like maths and looking after toby. and also i like outer space and i like being on my 
own." 
 
and she said, "i bet you're very good at maths, aren't you." 
 
and i said, "i am. i'm going to do my a-level maths next month. and i'm going to get an a grade." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "really? a-level maths?" 
 
i replied, "yes. i don't tell lies." 
 
and she said, "i apologize. i

s. alexander said, "not really, no. i mean, i knew him well enough to say hello and talk to a little 
in the street, but i didn't know much about him. i think he worked in a bank. the national westminster. 
in town." 
 
and  i  said,  "father  says  that  he  is  an  evil  man.  do  you  know  why  he  said  that?  is  mr.  shears  an  evil 
man?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "why are you asking me about mr. shears, christopher?" 
 
i didn't say anything because i didn't want to be investigating wellington's murder and that was the reason 
i was asking about mr. shears. 
 
but mrs. alexander said, "is this about wellington?" 
 
and i nodded because that didn't count as being a detective. 
 
mrs. alexander didn't say anything. she walked to the little red box on a pole next to the gate to the park 
and she put ivor's poo into the box, which was a brown thing inside a red thing, which made my head feel 
funny so i didn't look. then she walked back to me. 
 
she sucked in a big breath and said, "per
 
 ___________________________
 
ce to be talking about this kind of thing." 
 
i was nervous. i did not know mrs. alexander. i knew that she was an old lady and that she liked dogs. 
but she was a stranger. and i never go into the park on my own because it is dangerous and people inject 
drugs behind the public toilets in the corner. i wanted to go home and go up to my room and feed toby 
and practice some maths. 
 
but i was excited, too. because i thought she might tell me a secret. and the secret might be about who 
killed wellington. or about mr. shears. and if she did that i might have more evidence against him, or be 
able to exclude him from my investigations. 
 
so because it was a super good day i decided to walk into the park with mrs. alexander, even though it 
scared me. 
 
when we were inside the park mrs. alexander stopped walking and said, "i am going to say something to 
you and you must promise not to tell your father that i told you this." 
 
i asked, "why?" 
 
and she said, "i shouldn't have said what i said

. and if i don't explain, you'll carry on wondering what i 
meant. and you might ask your father. and i don't want you to do that because i don't want you to upset 
him. so i'm going to explain why i said what i said. but before i do that you have to promise not to tell 
anyone i said this to you." 
 
i asked, "why?" 
 

and she said, "christopher, please, just trust me." 
 
and i said, "i promise." because if mrs. alexander told  me who killed wellington, or she told me that 
mr. shears had really killed mother, i could still go to the police and tell them because you are allowed to 
break a promise if someone has committed a crime and you know about it. 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "your mother, before she died, was very good friends with mr. shears." 
 
and i said, "i know." 
 
and she said, "no, christopher. i'm not sure that you do. i mean that they were very good friends. very, 
very good friends." 
 
i thought about this for a while and sa

th someone, then it is not so bad. 
 
and when i got home from school father was still at work, so i went into the kitchen and took the key out 
of the little china jug shaped like a nun and opened the back door and went outside and looked inside the 
dustbin to find my book. 
 
i  wanted  to  get  my  book  back  because  i  liked  writing  it.  i  liked  having  a  project  to  do  and  i  liked  it 
especially if it was a difficult project like a book. also i still didn't know who had killed wellington and 
my book was where i had kept all the clues that i had discovered and i did not want them to be thrown 
away. 
 
but my book wasn't in the dustbin. 
 
i put the lid back on the dustbin and walked down the garden to have a look in the bin where father keeps 
the garden waste, such as lawn clippings and apples that have fallen off the trees, but my book wasn't in 
there either. 
 
i wondered if father had put it into his van and driven to the tip and put it into one of the big bins there,

you're not going to like it, but. . . you have to know that i am going to tell you the truth from now on. 
about everything. because. . . if you don't tell the truth now, then later on. . . later on it hurts even more. 
so. . ." 
 
father rubbed his face with his hands and pulled his chin down with his fingers and stared at the wall. i 
could see him out of the corner of my eye. 
 
and he said, "i killed wellington, christopher." 

 
i  wondered  if  this  was  a  joke,  because  i  don't  understand  jokes,  and  when  people  tell  jokes  they  don't 
mean what they say. 
 
but  then  father  said,  "please.  christopher.  just.  .  .  let  me  explain."  then  he  sucked  in  some  air  and  he 
said, "when your mum left. . . eileen. . . mrs. shears. . . she was very good to us. very good to me. she 
helped  me through a very difficult time. and i'm not sure i would have  made it without her. well, yo

k.  christopher.  i'm  sorry.  let's  leave  it  for  tonight,  ok?  i'm  going  to  go 
downstairs and you get some sleep and we'll talk in the morning." then he said, "it's going to be all right. 
honestly. trust me." 
 
then he stood up and took a deep breath and went out of the room. 
 
i sat on the bed for a long time looking at the floor. then i heard toby scratching in his cage. i looked up 
and saw him staring through the bars at me. 
 
i had to get out of the house. father had murdered wellington. that meant he could murder me, because i 
couldn't trust him, even though he had said "trust me," because he had told a lie about a big thing. 
 
 
but i couldn't get out of the house straightaway because he would see me, so i would have to wait until he 
was asleep. 

 
the time was 11:16 p.m. 
 
i tried doubling 2's again, but i couldn't get past 215, which was 32768. so i groaned to make the time pass 
quicker and not think. 
 
then  it  was  1:20  a.m.  but  i  hadn't  heard  father  come

e to come out. 
 
and then i had to decide what to do because i couldn't live in the house with father anymore because it 
was dangerous. 
 
so i made a decision. 
 
i decided that i would go and knock on mrs. shears's door and i would go and live with her, because i 
knew her and she wasn't a stranger and i had stayed in her house before, when there was a power cut on 
our side of the street. and this time she wouldn't tell me to go away because i would be able to tell her 

who  had  killed  wellington  and  that  way  she  would  know  that  i  was  a  friend.  and  also  she  would 
understand why i couldn't live with father anymore. 
 
i took the licorice laces and the pink wafer biscuit and the last clementine out of my special food box and 
put them in my pocket and hid the special food box under the fertilizer bag. then i picked up toby's cage 
and my extra coat and i climbed out from behind the shed. i walked up the garden and down the side of 
the house. i undid the bolt in the garden

and mrs. alexander said, "right." and then she said, "are you and your father moving house?" 
 
and i said, "no." 
 
and she said, "so, why are you going to london?" 
 
and i said, "i'm going to live with mother." 
 
and she said, "i thought you told me your mother was dead." 
 
and i said, "i thought she was dead, but she was still alive. and father lied to me. and also he said he 
killed wellington." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "oh, my goodness." 
 
and  i  said,  "i'm  going  to  live  with  my  mother  because  father  killed  wellington  and  he  lied  and  i'm 
frightened of being in the house with him." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "is your mother here?" 
 
and i said, "no. mother is in london." 
 
and she said, "so you're going to london on your own?" 
 
and i said, "yes."

were. 
 
then he said, "the lady at the café says you've been here for 2½ hours, and when she tried talking to you, 
you were in a complete trance." 
 
then he said, "what's your name?" 
 
and i said, "christopher boone." 
 
and he said, "where do you live?" 
 
and i said, "36 randolph street," and i started feeling better because i like policemen and it was an easy 
question, and i wondered whether i should tell him that father killed wellington and whether he would 
arrest father. 
 
and he said, "what are you doing here?" 
 
and i said, "i needed to sit down and be quiet and think." 
 
and he said, "ok, let's keep it simple. what are you doing at the railway station?" 
 
and i said, "i'm going to see mother." 
 
and he said, "mother?" 
 
and i said, "yes, mother." 
 
and he said, "when's your train?"

and i thought it would be someone i knew, like a teacher from school or one of the people who live in 
our street, but it wasn't. it was the policeman again. and he said, "caught you just in time," and he was 
breathing really loud and holding his knees. 
 
and i didn't say anything. 
 
and he said, "we've got your father at the police station." 
 
and i thought he was going to say that they had arrested father for killing wellington, but he didn't. he 
said, "he's looking for you." 
 
and i said, "i know." 
 
and he said, "so, why are you going to london?" 
 
and i said, "because i'm going to live with mother." 
 
and he said, "well, i think your father might have something to say about that." 
 
and then i thought that he was going to take me back to father and that was frightening because he was a 
policeman  and  policemen  are  meant  to  be  good,  so  i  started  to  run  away,  but  he  grabbed  me  and  i

and he said, "ok, let's not get overexcited here." and then he said, "i'm going to take you back to the 
police station and you and me and your dad can sit down and have a little chat about who's going where." 
 
and i said, "i'm going to live with mother, in london." 
 
and he said, "not just yet you're not." 
 
and i said, "have you arrested father?" 
 
and he said, "arrested him? what for?" 
 
and i said, "he killed a dog. with a garden fork. the dog was called wellington." 
 
and the policeman said, "did he now?" 
 
and i said, "yes, he did." 

 
 
and he said, "well, we can talk about that as well." and then he said, "right, young man, i think you've 
done enough adventuring for one day." 
 
and then he reached out to touch me again and i started to scream again, and he said, "now listen, you 
little monkey. you can either do what i say or i am going to have to make --" 
 
and then the train jiggled and it began to move. 
 
and then the policeman said, "shitt

and then the train doors closed and the train started moving and it roared again but not as loud this time 
and 5 carriages went past and it went into the tunnel at the end of the little station and it was quiet again 
and the people were all walking into the tunnels that went out of the little station. 
 
and i was shaking  and i wanted to  be back at home,  and then i realized i couldn't be at home because 
father was there and he told a lie and he killed wellington, which meant that it wasn't my home anymore, 
my home was 451c chapter road, london nw2 5ng, and it scared me, having a wrong thought like, "i 
wish i was back at home again," because it meant my mind wasn't working properly. 
 
and then more people came into the little station and it became fuller and then the roaring began again 
and i closed my eyes and i sweated and felt sick and i felt the feeling like a balloon inside my chest and it 
was so big i found it hard to breathe. and then the pe

and then she said, "oh my god. christopher. i didn't. . . i didn't think i'd ever. . . why are you here on 
your own?" 
 
and mr. shears said, "are you going to come in or are you going to stay out here all night?" 
 
and  i  said,  "i'm  going  to  live  with  you  because  father  killed  wellington  with  a  garden  fork  and  i'm 
frightened of him." 
 
and mr. shears said, "jumping jack christ." 
 
and mother said, "roger, please. come on, christopher, let's go inside and get you dried off." 
 

so  i  stood  up  and  i  went  inside  the  house  and  mother  said,  "you  follow  roger,"  and  i  followed  mr. 
shears  up  the  stairs  and  there  was  a  landing  and  a  door  which  said  flat  c  and  i  was  scared  of  going 
inside because i didn't know what was inside.

something dreadful had happened, or you'd moved away and i'd never find out where you were." 
 
and i said, "father said you were dead." 
 
and she said, "what?" 
 
and i said, "he said you went into hospital because you had something wrong with your heart. and then 
you had a heart attack and died and he kept all the letters in a shirt box in the cupboard in his bedroom 
and i found them because i was looking for a book i was writing about wellington being killed and he'd 
taken it away from me and hidden it in the shirt box." 
 
and then mother said, "oh my god." 
 

and then she didn't say anything for a long while. and then she made a loud wailing noise like an animal 
on a nature program on television. 
 
and i didn't like her doing this because it was a loud noise, and i said, "why are you doing that?" 
 
and she didn't say anything for while, and then she said, "oh, christopher, i'm so sorry." 
 
and i said, "it's not your fault."

 and i had to open the door. 
and she said she wouldn't let him take me away and she promised. so i picked toby up and opened the 
door. 
 
and there was a policeman outside the door and he said, "are you christopher boone?" 
 
and i said i was. 
 
and he said, "your father says you've run away. is that right?" 
 
and i said, "yes." 
 
and he said, "is this your mother?" and he pointed at mother. 
 
and i said, "yes." 
 
and he said, "why did you run away?" 
 
and i said, "because father killed wellington, who is a dog, and i was frightened of him." 
 
and he said, "so i've been told." and then he said, "do you want to go back to swindon to your father or 
do you want to stay here?" 
 
and i said, "i want to stay here." 

 
and he said, "and how do you feel about that?" 
 
and i said, "i want to stay here." 
 
and the policeman said, "hang on. i'm asking your mother." 
 
and mother said, "he told christopher i was dead." 
 
and the policeman said, "ok, let's. . . let's not get into an argument

and then father came into my room. but i was holding my swiss army knife with the saw blade out in 
case he grabbed me. and mother came into the room as well, and she said, "it's ok, christopher. i won't 
let him do anything. you're all right." 
 
and father bent down on his knees near the bed and he said, "christopher?" 
 
but i didn't say anything. 
 
and he said, "christopher, i'm really, really sorry. about everything. about wellington. about the letters. 
about making you run away. i never meant. . . i promise i will never do anything like that again. hey. 
come on, kiddo." 
 
and then he held up his right hand and spread his fingers out in a fan so that i could touch his fingers, but 
i didn't because i was frightened. 
 
and father said, "shit. christopher, please." 
 
and there were tears dripping off his face. 
 
and no one said anything for a while. 
 
and then mother said, "i think you should go now," but she was talki

you did really well." 
 
and then he went away and i watched the rest of university challenge. 
 
and  the  next  week  father  told  mother  she  had  to  move  out  of  the  house,  but  she  couldn't  because  she 
didn't have any money to pay rent for a flat. and i asked if father would be arrested and go to prison for 
killing  wellington  because  we  could  live  in  the  house  if  he  was  in  prison.  but  mother  said  the  police 
would  only  arrest  father  if  mrs.  shears  did  what  is  called  pressing  charges,  which  is  telling  the  police 
you want them to arrest someone for a crime, because the police don't arrest people for little crimes unless 
you ask them and mother said that killing a dog was only a little crime. 
 
but then everything was ok because mother got a job on the till in a garden center and th

and then i will get a first class honors degree and i will become a scientist.

number up to 7,057. he relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. he cannot 
stand  to  be  touched.  although  gifted  with  a  superbly  logical  brain,  christopher  is  autistic.  everyday 
interactions  and  admonishments  have  little  meaning  for  him.  routine,  order,  and  predictability  shelter 
him  from  the  messy  wider  world.  then,  at  fifteen,  christopher's  carefully  constructed  world  falls  apart 
when he finds his neighbor's dog, wellington, impaled on a garden fork, and he is initially blamed for the 
killing. 
 
christopher decides that he will track down the real killer and turns to his favorite fictional character, the 
impeccably  logical  sherlock  holmes,  for  inspiration.  but  the  investigation  leads  him  down  some 
unexpected paths and ultimately brings him face to face with the dissolution of his parents' marriage. as 
he  tries  to  deal  with  the  crisis  within  his  own  family,  we  are  drawn  into  the  wor
