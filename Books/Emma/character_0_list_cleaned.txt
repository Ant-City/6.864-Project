[CHARACTER] - 
                 the
protagonist of the novel. in the well-known first sentence of the
novel, the narrator describes emma as "handsome, clever, and rich,
with a comfortable home and happy disposition." in some ways, the
twenty-year-old emma is mature for her age. because her mother is
dead and her older sister married, she is already the head of her
father's household. she cares for her father and oversees the social
goings-on in the village of highbury. emma's misplaced confidence
in her abilities as a matchmaker and her prudish fear of love constitute
the central focus of the novel, which traces emma's mistakes and growing
self-understanding.
