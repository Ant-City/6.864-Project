[CHARACTER]

the call of the wild is, first and foremost,
the story of buck's gradual transformation from a tame beast into
a wild animal. but even as the novel celebrates the life of a wild
creature, it presents us with the character of [CHARACTER], whose
connection to buck suggests that there may be something good and
natural in the human-dog relationship, despite its flaws. thornton,
a seasoned gold prospector, saves buck from being beaten to death
by the odious hal and then becomes buck's master. from then on,
a deep and abiding love blossoms between man and dog. their relationship
is a reciprocal one--thornton saves buck, and buck later saves thornton
from drowning in a river. it is clear that buck is more of a partner
than a servant to the prospector. this mutual respect, we are assured,
is characteristic of all thornton's relationships to dogs--every
one of his animals bears an abiding love for him, which is returned
in kind. even as buck is increasingly drawn to a life away from
humanity, a life in the wild, his affection for thornton keeps him
from making the final break. indeed, so strong is their bond that
it is broken only when thornton dies, and even then buck makes an
annual pilgrimage to his last master's final resting place.
buck is prone to visions of more primitive worlds, and
sometimes he sees the humans around him as ancient men, wearing
animal skins and living in caves or trees. in some of these visions,
he is running alongside these men, protecting them from the terrors
of the night. his relationship to thornton, the novel implies, is
like these ancient man-dog connections; it is primitive rather than civilized, and
so it remains strong even as buck leaves the civilized world behind.
