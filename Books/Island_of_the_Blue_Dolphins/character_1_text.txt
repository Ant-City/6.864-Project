n i returned, i had hoped that he would be gone. but now as i crawled under the fence i did not feel
the same.
i called out, 'dog, dog,' for i had no other name for him.
i ran towards the house, calling it. he was inside. he was just getting to his feet, stretching himself and yawning. he looked
first at the fish i carried and then at me and moved his tail. that night i stayed in the house. before i fell asleep i thought of a
name for him, for i could not call him dog. the name i thought of was rontu, which means in our language fox eyes.

the white men's ship did not return that spring or in the summer. but every day, whether i was on the headland or gathering
shellfish on the rocks or working on my canoe, i watched for it. i also watched for the red ship of the aleuts.
i was not sure what i would do if the aleuts came. i could hide in the cave which i had stored with food and water, for it was
surrounded by thick brush and the mouth of the ravine could only be reached from the sea. the

ng all the planks, by cutting the sinews and heating the pitch that bound them together. i then shaped these planks to
half their length, using sharp knives made from a black stone which is to be found at one place on the island, and bound them
back together with fresh pitch and sinews.
the canoe when i had finished was not so beautiful as it had been before, but i could now lift one end of it and drag it
through the waves. all the time i was working on the canoe, which was most of that summer, rontu was with me. he was
either sleeping in the shade of the canoe or running up and down the sandpits chasing the pelicans that roost there in great
numbers because there are numerous fish near by. he never caught any of the birds, yet he would keep trying until his tongue
hung out of his mouth.
he had learned his name quickly and many words that meant something to him. zalwit, for example, which is our word for
pelican, and naip which means fish. i talked to him often, using these words and others

 and many that he did not understand,
just as though i were talking to one of my people.
'rontu,' i would say after he had stolen a special fish i had speared for my supper, ‘tell me why it is that you are such a
handsome dog and yet such a thief.'
he would put his head on one side and then the other, although he knew only two of the words, and look at me.
or i would say, ‘it is a beautiful day. i have never seen the ocean so calm and the sky looks like a blue shell. how long do
you think these days will last?'
rontu would look up at me just the same, though he understood none of the

words, acting as if he did. 
because of this i was not lonely. i did not know how lonely i had been until i had rontu to talk to.
when the canoe was finished and the pitch had dried i wanted to find out how it went through the water and if the planks
leaked, so we set off on a long voyage around the island. the voyage took all of one day, from dawn until night.
there are many sea caves on the island of the blue dolphins and some of them are large and go far back into the cliffs. one
of these was near the head- land where my house stood.
the opening was narrow, not much wider than the canoe, but once we were in

y turnings and came at last to another room much like the first.
along one side was a wide shelf of rock, which ran out to the sea through a narrow opening. the tide was full and yet the
shelf was out of the water. it was a fine place to hide a canoe, which could be lifted out and stored there where no one could
find it. the ledge joined the cliff just below my house. all i needed was a trail down to the cave and then the canoe would be
close at hand.
'we have made a great discovery,' i said to rontu.
rontu did not hear me. he was watching a devil- fish, just beyond the opening of the cave. this fish has a small head with
eyes that bulge and many arms. all day rontu had been barking - at the cormorants, the gulls, the seals - at everything that
moved. now he was quiet, watching the black thing in the water. 
i let the canoe drift along and knelt down out of sight until i could pick up my spear.
the devilfish was in front of us, swimming slowly near the surface, moving all his arms at once. 
 
 ___________________________
 
large devilfish are
dangerous if you are in the sea, for their arms are as long as a man, and they can quickly wrap them around you. they also
have a big mouth and a sharp beak where their arms join their head. this one was the largest i had ever seen.
since rontu was standing in front of me and i could not put the canoe into a better position, i had to lean out to use the spear.
as i did so, the devilfish saw my movement and let loose in the water a black cloud of liquid which instantly hid him from
view.
i knew that the devil fish would not be in the centre of this cloud, that he had left it behind. i therefore did not aim my spear
at it, but picked up the paddle and waited until he appeared. he was now twice the length of the canoe from me and though

i
paddled fast i could not overtake him.
'rontu,' i said, for he was watching the black cloud in the water, 'you have much to learn about the devilfish.'
rontu did not look at me or bark. he put his head to one side and then the other, still puzzled, more so when the cloud
disappeared and nothing was left except clear water.
devilfish is the best food in the seas. the flesh is white and tender and very sweet. but they are difficult to catch without a
special kind of spear, which i now decided to make during the winter when i would have much time.
i took the canoe to coral cove, not far from the cave, and pulled it up on the shore out of reach of the w

would be safe until spring when i would hide it in the cave that rontu and i had found. it was easy to paddle and did not leak.
i was very happy.

storms came early with rain and between the rains fierce winds struck the island and filled the air with sand. during this time,
i made myself another dress, but most of the days i spent fashioning a spear to catch the giant devilfish.
i had seen this spear made, as i had seen my father make bows and arrows, yet i knew little about it, no more than i had about
the others. still i remembered how it looked and how it wa

s used. from these memories i made it after many errors and many
hours of work, sitting on the door while rontu slept near by and the storms beat upon the roof. 
four of the sea-elephant teeth were left, and though i broke all except one, this i worked down to a head with a barbed point.
i then made a ring and fastened it to the end of the shaft, and into this ring fitted the head, which was tied to a long string
made of braided sinew. when the spear was thrown and struck a devilfish, the head came loose from the shaft. the shaft
floated on the water, but the pointed barb was held by the string which was

 tied to your wrist. this spear was especially good
because it could be thrown from a distance.
on the first day of spring i went down to coral cove with my new spear. i knew it was spring because that morning at dawn
the sky was filled with hocks of darting birds. they were small and black and came only at this time of year. they came out
of the south and stayed for two suns, hunting food in the ravines, and then flew off in one great flight towards the north.
rontu did not go with me to the beach because i had let him out of the fence and he had not returned. the wild dogs had been
to the house many times that winter and he had paid no heed to them, but the night before, after they had come and gone, he
had stood at the fence. he stood and whined and walked up and down. it worried me to see him act so strangely, and when he
refused to eat i finally let him out.
now i pushed the canoe into the water and drifted cowards the reef where the devilfish lived. t

he water was so clear that it
was like the air around me. far down, the sea ferns moved as though a breeze were blowing there, and among them swam the
devilfish trailing their long arms.
it was good to be on the sea after the winter storms, with the new spear in my hand, but all the morning as i hunted the giant
devilfish i kept thinking of rontu. i should have been happy, yet thinking of him i was not. would he come back, i
wondered, or had he gone to live with the wild dogs? would he again be my enemy ? if he were my enemy, i knew that i
could never kill him, now that he had been my friend.
when the sun was high i hid the canoe in the cave we had found, for once more it was the time the aleuts might return, and
with the two small bass i had speared, though not the giant devil fish, i went up the cliff. i had planned to make a trail fr

mb was steep. as i reached the top, i paused for breath. the morning was quiet except for the noise of the little birds
flying from bush to bush and the cries of the gulls who did not like these strangers. then i heard the sound of dogs fighting.
the sound came from far off, perhaps from the ravine, and taking my bow and arrows, i hurried in that direction.
i went down the path which led to the spring. there were tracks of the wild dogs around the spring, and among them i saw 
the large ones of rontu. the tracks led away through the ravine which winds to the sea. i heard again the distant sound of
fighting.
i went slowly through the ravine because of my bow and arrows.
at last i came to the place where it opens into a meadow right at the edge of a low sea cliff. some- times in the summers, a
long time ago, my people had lived here. they gathered shellfish on the rocks and ate them here, leaving the shells which
after many summers had formed a mound. over this grass had grown, and a thick-le
 
 ___________________________
 
aved plant called gnapan.
on this mound, among the grasses and the plants, stood rontu. he stood facing me, with his back to the sea cliff. in front of
him in a half-circle were the wild dogs. at first i thought that the pack had driven him there against the cliff and were getting
ready to attack him. but 1 soon saw that two dogs stood out from the rest of the pack, between it and rontu, and that their
muzzles were wet with blood.
one of these dogs was the leader who had taken rontu's place when he had come to live with me. the other one, which was
spotted, i had never seen. the battle was between rontu and these two dogs. the rest were there to fall upon whichever was
beaten.
so great was the noise made by the pack, they had not heard me as i came through the brush, nor did they see me now as i
stood at the edge of the meadow. they sat on their haunches and barked, with their eyes fixed on the others. but i was sure
that rontu knew i was somewhere near, for he raised his

head and smelled the air.
the two dogs were trotting back and forth along the foot of the mound, watching rontu. the fight had probably started at the
spring and they had stalked him to this place where he had chosen to fight.
the sea cliff was behind him and they could not reach him from that direction so they were trying to think of some other way.
it would have been easier if one could have attacked him from the back and one from the front.
rontu did not move from where he stood on top of the mound. now and again he lowered his head to lick a wound on his leg,
but whenever he did he always kept his eyes on the two dogs trotting up and down.
i could have shot them, for they were within reach of my bow, or driven off the pack, yet i stood in the brush and watched.
this was a battle between them and rontu. if i stopped it, they would surely fight again, perhaps at some other place less
favourable to him. 
rontu again licked his wound and t

his time he did not watch the two dogs moving slowly past the mound. i thought it was a
lure and so it proved to be, for suddenly they ran towards him. they came from opposite sides of the mound, ears laid back
and teeth bared.
rontu did not wait for the attack, but, leaping at the nearer one, turned his shoulder and with his head lowered caught the
dog's foreleg. the pack was quiet. in the silence, i could hear the sound of the bone breaking, and the dog backed away on
three legs.
the spotted dog had reached the top of the mound. whirling away from the one he had crippled, rontu faced him, but not in
time to fend off the first heavy rush. teeth slashed at his throat and, as he turned his body, struck him instead on the fla

and he went down.
at that moment, while he lay there on the grass with the dog circling warily and the pack moving slowly towards him,
without knowing that i did so, i fitted an arrow to the bow. a good distance separated rontu from his attacker and i could end
the battle before he was wounded further or the pack fell upon him. yet, as before, i did not send the arrow.
the spotted dog paused, and turned in his tracks, and again leaped, this time from behind.
rontu was still lying in the grass with his paws under him and i thought he did not see that the other was upon him. but
crouching there, he suddenly raised himself and at the same time fastened his teeth in the dog's throat.
together they rolled off the mound, yet rontu did not let go. the pack sat restless in the grass.
in a short time rontu rose to his feet and left the spotted dog where it lay. he walked to the top of the mound and lifted his
head and gave a long howl. i had never heard this soun

d before. it was the sound of many things that i did not understand.
he trotted past me and up the ravine. when i got to the house he was there waiting, as if he had not been away or nothing had
happened.
in all the lime he lived, rontu never left again. and the wild dogs, which for some reason divided into two packs, after that
never returned to the head- land.

flowers were plentiful that spring because of the winter's heavy rains. the dunes were covered with mars of sand flowers,
which are red and have tiny eyes that are sometimes pink and sometimes white. yuccas grew tall among the rocks of the
ravine. their heads were clustered with curly globes no larger than pebbles and the colour of the sun when it rises. lupins
grew

o small for my two birds, but instead of building a larger one, i cut the tips of their
wings, one wing of each, so they could not fly away, and let them loose in the house. by the time their wings had grown out,
they had learned to take food from my hand. they would jump down from the roof and perch on my arm and beg, making
their reep, reep sound.
when their wings began to feather out, i cut them again. this time i let them loose in the yard, where they hopped around
hunting food, perching on rontu who by now had got used to them. the next time they feathered out, i did not trim their
wings, but they never flew farther away than the ravine and would always come back at night to sleep and, no matter how
much they had eaten, to ask for food. 
one, because he was larger, i called tainor. i named him after a young man i liked who had been killed by the aleuts. the
other was called lurai, which was a name i wished i had been called instead of karana.

another skirt. this one i also made of yucca fibres softened in water and
braided into twine. i made it just like the others, with folds running lengthwise. it was open on both sides and hung to my
knees. the belt i made of sealskin which could be tied in a knot. i also made a pair of sandals from sealskin for walking over
the dunes when the sun was hot, or just to be dressed up when i wore my new skirt of yucca twine.
often i would put on the skirt and the sandals and walk along the cliff with rontu. sometimes i made a wreath of flowers and
fastened it in my hair. after the aleuts had killed our men at coral cove, all the women of our tribe had singed their hair
short as a sign of mourning. i had singed mine, too, with a faggot, but now it had grown long again and came to my waist. i
parted it and let it fall down my back, except when i wore a wreath. then i made braids and fastened them with long whalebone
pins.
i also made a wreath for rontu's neck, which he did not like. together we wou

though the white men's ship did not return that spring, it was a happy time. the air smelled of flowers and birds sang

another summer had come and still i had not speared the giant devilfish that lived near the cave.
every day during the spring, rontu and i went to look for him. i would put the canoe in the water and paddle slowly through
the cave, from one opening to the other, often several times. i saw many devilfish there where the black water is streaked with
light, but not the giant one.
at last i gave up looking for him and began to gather abalones for winter. the red shells hold the sweetest meat and are best
for drying, though the green ones and the black are also good. because the red ones are the sweetest, starfish prey upon them.

 at coral cove, but i had been watching the reef and waiting
for the right time to harvest. this is when there are few starfish feeding, for they are as hard to pry loose from an abalone as
an abalone is to pry from a rock.
the tide was low and the reef rose far out of the water. along its sides were great numbers of red abalones and very few
starfish, so before the sun was high i filled the bottom of the canoe.
the day was windless, and since i had all i could carry, i tied the canoe, and with rontu following me, climbed on to the reef
to look for fish to spear for our supper.
blue dolphins were leaping beyond the kelp beds. in the kelp otter were playing at the games they never tire of. and around
me everywhere the gulls were fishing for scallops, which were numerous that summer. they grow on the floating kelp leaves
and there were so many of them that much of the kelp near the reef had been dragged to the bottom. still there were scallops
that the gulls could reach, and taking them in th

eir beaks they would fly far above the reef and let them drop. the gulls would
then swoop down to the rocks and pick the meat from the broken shells.
scallops fell on the reef like rain, which amused me, but not rontu who could not understand what the gulls were doing.
dodging this way and that i went to the end of the reef where the biggest fish live. with a sinew line and a hook made of
abalone shell i caught two that had large heads and long teeth, but are good to eat. i gave one to rontu and on the way back to
the canoe gathered purple sea urchins to use for dyeing.
rontu, who was trotting along in front of me, suddenly dropped his fish and stood looking down over the edge of the reef.
there, swimming in the clear water, was a devil- fish. it was the same one i had been hunting for. it was the giant!
seldom did you see any devilfish here, for they like deep places, and the water along this part of the reef is shallow. perhaps
this one lived in the cave and came here only when h

e could not find food. rontu made no sound. i fixed the head of the
spear and the long string that held it to my wrist. i then crawled back to the edge of the reef. 
the giant had not moved. he was floating just below the surface of the water and i could plainly see his eyes. they were the
size of small stones and stood out from his head, with black rims and gold centres and in the centres a black spot, like the
eyes of a spirit i had once seen on a night that rain fell and lighting forked in the sky.

nd leaned backwards.
the string snapped tight with the weight of the devilfish. it began to stretch, and fearing that it might break, i walked forward,
yet i made him pull me every step.
he was moving towards the cave, along the edge of the reef. the cave was a good distance away. if he got there i would
surely lose him. the canoe was tied just in front of me. once i was in it, i could let him pull me until he grew tired. but there
was no way to untie the canoe and still hold on to the string. 
rontu all this time was running up and down the reef barking and leaping at me, which made my task harder.
step by step i walked forward, until the devilfish was in the deep water close to the cave. he was so close that i had to stop,
even if the sinew broke and i lost him. i therefore braced myself and did not move. the sinew stretched, throwing off drops
of water. i could hear it stretch and i was sure it would break. i did not feel it cutting into my hands, though they bled.
the pull suddenly less

rds some rocks that were about twice the length of the suing
away. he would be safe there, too, for among them were many places to hide.
i pulled in half the string while he was moving towards the rocks, but soon had to let it out. it grew tight and again began to
stretch. the water here was only a little over my waist, and i let myself down over the reef.
there was a sand bar not far from the rocks, and stepping carefully on the bottom, which was full of holes, i slowly made my
way towards it. rontu swam along by my side.
i reached the sand bar before the devilfish could hide himself in the rocks. the suing held and he turned about and once more
swam towards the cave. twice again he did this. each time i took in some of the suing. the third time, as he came up into the
shallow water, i walked backward across the sand bar so he would not see me, and pulled on the string with all my strength.
the giant slid up on the sand. he lay with his arms spread out, partly in the water, and i thought h

e was dead. then i saw his
eyes moving. before i could shout a warning, rontu had rushed forward and seized him. but the devilfish was too heavy to
lift or shake. as rontu's jaws sought another hold, three of the many arms wound themselves around his neck.
devilfish are only dangerous when in the water where they can fasten themselves to you with their long arms. these arms
have rows of suckers underneath them and they can drag you under and hold you there until you drown. but even on land the
devilfish can injure you, for he is strong and does not die quickly.
the giant was flailing his arms, struggling to get back into the water. little by little he was draggin

g rontu with him. i could
no longer use the string because it was wound around rontu's legs.
the whalebone knife i used for prying abalones from the rocks was tied to a thong at my waist. the blade was thick at the
point but had a sharp edge. i dropped the coils of string and unfastened the knife as i ran. 
i ran past the devilfish and got between him and the deep water. so many of his arms were flailing that it was useless to cut
any one of them. one struck me on the leg and burned like a whip. another, which rontu had chewed off, lay wriggling at
the edge of the water, as if

it were looking for something to fasten on to.
the head rose out of the twisting arms like a giant stalk. the gold eyes with their black rims were fixed on me. above the
sounds of the waves and the water splashing and rontu's barking, i could hear the snapping of his beak, which was sharper
than the knife i held in my hand.
i drove the knife down into his body and as i did this i was suddenly covered, or so it seemed, with a countless number of
leeches, sucking at my skin. fortunately one hand was free, the hand that held the knife, and again and again i struck down
through the tough hide. the suckers, which were fastened to me and pained greatly, lessened their hold. slowly the arms
stopped moving and then grew l

imp.
i tried to drag the devilfish out of the water, but my strength was gone. i did not even go back to the reef for my canoe,
though i did take the shaft and the head of the spear, which had cost me much labour, and the sinew line.
it was night before rontu and i got back to the house.
rontu had a gash on his nose from the giant's beak, and i had many cuts and bruises. i saw two more giant devilfish alone the
reef that summer, but i did not try to spear them.
20
i gathered two more canoe-loads of abalones soon after that, mostly the sweet red ones, which i cleaned and carried to the
house. along the south part of the fence where the sun shone most of the day, i built long shelves out of branches and put the
meat up to dry. abalones are larger than your hand and twice as thick when

fresh, but they shrink small in the sun so you
have to dry many.
in the old days on the island there were children to keep away the gulls, which would rather feast on abalones than anything
else. in one morning, if the meat was left unguarded, they could fly off with a month's harvest.
at first, whenever i went to the spring or to the beach, i left rontu behind to chase them off, but he did not like this and
howled all the time i was gone. finally i tied strings to some of the abalone shells and hung them from poles. the insides of
the shells are bright and catch the sun and they turn one way and another in the wind. after that i had little trouble with the 
gulls.
i also caught small fish in a net i had made and hung them up to dry for winter light. with meat drying on the shelves and the
shells flashing and turning in the wind and the strings

 of fish hanging on the fence, the yard looked as if a whole village were
living there on the headland instead of just rontu and me.
every morning after i had gathered food for winter, we went out on the sea. at the end of summer i would gather roots and
seeds to store, but now there was nothing that needed to be done. we went many places those first days of summer - to the
beach where the sea elephants lived, to black cave which was even larger than the first cave we found, and to tall rock
where the cormorants roosted.
tall rock was more than a league from the island and was black and shimmering because it was cove

ted to make myself a skirt of cormorant feathers.
black cave was on the south coast of the island, near the place where the canoes were stored. in front of the cave was a high
ledge of rocks surrounded by deep kelp beds, and i would have paddled by it if i had not seen a sea-hawk fly out. the sun
was in the west and i had a long way to go to reach home, but i was curious about the hawk and the place he lived in.
the opening of the cave was small, like the one in the cave under the headland, and rontu and i had to crouch low to get
through. weak light came from outside and i saw that we were in a room with black, shining walls that curved high overhead.
at the far end of the room was another small opening. it was long and very dark, but when we reached the end of it we were
in another room which was larger than the first and lit with a shaft of light. the light came from the sun, which shone down
through a jagged crack in the ceiling.

g over the walls, rontu barked, then began to howl. the sound
echoed through the cave like the howling of a whole pack of dogs. it sent a cold feeling down my back.
'be quiet!' i shouted, putting my hand over his jaws. my words echoed and echoed in the room.
i turned the canoe around and started back to- wards the opening. above it, on a deep ledge that ran from one side of the
room to the other, my gaze fell upon a row of strange figures. there must have been two dozen of them standing against the
black wall. they we

 stars change. i knew that the skeleton who sat on the ledge playing his flute was one of my ancestors, and the
others with the glittering eyes, though only images, were too, but still i was sleepless and afraid.
with the first light, another high tide almost set- ting, we left the cave. i did not look up at those standing quietly on the ledge
or at the flute player playing for them, but paddled fast out into the morning sea. nor did i look back.
'i suppose this cave once had a name,' i said to rontu, who was as glad to be free as i was, 'but i have never heard of it or
heard it spoken about. we will call it black cave and never in all our days go there again.'
when we came back from out voyage to tall rock, i hid the canoe in the cave below the headland. it was hard work, but
each time i would lift the canoe from the water and on to the ledge, even though i planned to go out the next morning.
two summers had come and gone and the aleut hunters had not returned, yet during these days i alwa

many leagues. wherever we went in the canoe i would never be gone longer than half a day. on the way home, i always 
paddled close to shore and looked for them.
it was the last time that we went to tall rock that the aleuts came.

 the cove. canoes were bringing goods to the
shore and some were out in the kelp beds, beginning to hunt for otter. there was a fire on the shore and beside it, a girl. she 
was cooking something and i could see the fire shining on her hair.
i did not stay long on the headland. always in the past i had gone to the ravine by a different way so as not to wear a trail.
this time i went off towards the west, along the cliff, and then doubled back through the brush, being careful to leave no
tracks. rontu's prints did not matter because the aleuts knew that there were dogs on the island.
the cave was very dark and i had trouble getting rontu to go through the small opening. only after i had crawled in and out
several times would he follow me. i closed the opening with stones, and since i was tired, lay down and slept all that day. i
slept until i could see the stars shining between the cracks in the rocks.

was being used and find my steps leading to the cave.
i stood on the rock until the aleut fires died. i thought of everything i could do, of the different places i could go, and at last
decided to stay in the ravine. the far end of the island had no springs, and if i moved there i would have no place to hide the
canoe which i might need.
i went back to the cave and did not leave it until the moon was full. there was little food left. rontu and i climbed to the
headland and when we passed the house i saw that three of the whale ribs had been cut from the fence. no one was there or 
else rontu would have barked. i waited until the tide was low, which was close to dawn, and filled a basket with sea water
and abalones. we were back in the cave before it grew light.
the sea water kept the abalones fresh, but when we had to go out again the night was too dark to find our way to the reef. i
therefore had to gather roots. i could never g

during all this time i saw none of the aleuts. nor did the girl come near the cave, though i found her footsteps far down the
ravine where she had been to dig roots. the aleuts had not brought their dogs, which was fortunate, for they would have
found rontu's tracks and followed us to the cave.
the days were long for rontu and me. at first he would pace up and down the cave and stand at the opening sniffing through
the cracks. i did not let him out except when i was with him for fear he would go to the camp and not come back. after a
while he got used to this and would lie all day and watch whatever i was doing.
it was dark in the cave, even when the sun was high, so i burned the small fish i had stored. by their light i began to make a
cormorant skirt, working every day on it. the ten skins i had taken at tall r

rst time, but no closer to the cave. i had begun to feel safe, for the winter storms would soon be here and the aleuts
would leave. before another moon they would be gone.
i had never seen the skirt in the sunlight. it was black, but underneath were green and gold colours, and all the feathers
shimmered as though they were on fire. it was more beautiful than i had thought it would be. i worked fast now that it was
almost finished, yet from time to time i would stop to hold it against my waist.
'rontu,' i said, feeling giddy with happiness, ‘if you were not a male dog i would make you one too, as beautiful as this.' 
rontu, who was sprawled out at the mouth of the cave, raised his head and yawned at me and went back to sleep.
i was standing in the sunlight, holding the skirt to my waist, when rontu leaped to his feet. i heard the sound of steps. it came
from the direction of the spring and as i turned quickly i saw a girl looking down at me from the brush.
my spear stood beside the mouth o

f the cave within easy reach. the girl was not more than ten paces from me and with one
movement i could have picked up the spear and thrown it. why i did not throw the spear, i do not know, for she was one of
the aleuts who had killed my people on the beach of coral cove.
she said something and rontu left the mouth of the cave and walked slowly towards her. the hair raised on his neck, but then
he walked to where she stood and let her touch him.
the girl looked at me and made a motion with her hands which i took to mean that rontu was hers.
'no,' i cried and shook my head.
i picked up my spear.
she started to nun and i thought that she was going to flee back through the brush. she made another motion which i took to
mean that rontu was now mine. i did not believe her. i held the spear over

my shoulder, ready to throw.
'tutok,' she said, pointing to herself.
i did not say my name. i called rontu and he came back.
the girl looked at him and then at me and smiled.
she was older than i, but not so tall. she had a broad face and small eyes that were very black.
when she smiled, i saw that her teeth were worn down from chewing seal sinew, but they were very white.
i was still holding the cormorant skirt and the girl pointed to it and said something. there was one word - wintscha - which
sounded like a word that means pretty in our language. 
i was so proud of the skirt that i did not think.

nd take me to their camp. i
shook my head, and pointed to the far end of the island, away, away, for i did not trust her.
she kept looking towards the cave, but she said nothing more about it. i held the spear, which i could have thrown. i did not,
though i feared she would return with the hunters.
she came over to me and touched my arm. i did not like the feel of her hand. she said more words and smiled again and
walked to the spring and drank. the next moment she had disappeared in the brush. rontu did not try to follow her. she made
no noise as she went.
i crawled back in the cave and began to pack the things i owned. i had all the day to do it, because the men were working and
would not return to their camp before night.
by nightfall i was ready to go. i planned to take my canoe and go to the west part of the island. i could sleep there on the
rocks until the aleuts left, moving from place to place if i needed to. 
i carried five baskets up the ravine and hid them near my house. it was

getting dark and i had to go back to the cave for two
that were left. carefully i crawled through the brush and stopped just above the mouth of the cave and listened. rontu was
beside me and he listened also. no one could go through the brush in the dusk without making a sound, except someone who
had lived in it for a long time.
i went past the spring and waited and then on to the cave. i felt that someone had been there while i had been away. they
could be hiding in the dark watching me. they were waiting until i went into the cave.
i was afraid so i did not go in, but quickly turned around. as i did so i saw something in front of the cave, on the hat rock i
used

at dawn i went back to the ravine. there i hid myself on a brushy ledge. it was near the spring and from it i
could see the mouth of the cave.
the sun rose and shone through the ravine. i could see the necklace lying on the rock. the stones looked blacker than they
had in the darkness and there were many of them. i wanted to go down to the cave and count them, to see if they would make
two loops around my neck, but i did not leave the ledge.
i stayed there all the morning. the sun was high when rontu barked and i heard steps below me. the girl came out of the
brush singing. she walked to the cave, but when she saw the necklace lying on the rock she grew quiet. she picked up the
necklace and put it down again and peered into the mouth of the cave. two of my baskets were still there. then she went and
drank from the spring and started off through the brush.
i jumped to my feet. 'tutok,' i cried, running down the ravine. 'tutok.'
she came out of the brush so quickly that she must have been wai

he beads made not two loops but three. they
were long and oval instead of round, which is a very hard shape to make and takes much skill.
'wintscha,' she said. 
' wintscha,' i said, after her, the word strange on my tongue. then i said the word that meant pretty in our language.
'win-tai,' she said and laughed, because this was strange to her.
she touched the necklace, giving the word for it, and j gave mine. we pointed out other things - the spring, the cave, a gull
dying, the sun and the sky, rontu asleep - trading the names for them and laughing because they were so different. we sat
there on the rock until the sun was in the west and played this game. then tutok rose and made a gesture of farewell.

long black hair. i did not tell her my secret name.
'mah-nay, won-a-pa-lei,' she said.
'pah-say-no, tutok,' i replied.
i watched her go through the brush. i stood for a lon

rawled across it until i could look over
the rim. my heart beat loud.
the aleut ship was still there, but men were working on the deck and canoes were going back and forth. the wind blew hard
and few bales of otter skins lay on the shore so probably the ship would leave at dawn.
it was dark when i got back to the ravine. since the wind was very cold and i was no longer afraid that the aleuts would find
me, i made a fire in the cave and cooked a supper of shellfish and roots. i cooked enough for rontu and me and for tutok. i
knew tutok would not come, yet i put her food beside the fire and waited.
once rontu barked and i thought i heard the sound of footsteps and went to the opening and listened. i waited a long while
and did not eat. clouds moved from the north, covering the cold sky. the wind grew louder and made wild noises in the
ravine. at last i closed the mouth of the cave with stones.
at dawn i went to the headland. the wind had died. fog lay over the sea, washing against the island

n burned away the fog. the little harbour was deserted. the aleut 
ship with its red-beaked prow and red sails had gone. at first, knowing that i could now leave the cave and move back into
my house on the headland, i was happy. but as i stood there on the high rock looking down at the deserted harbour and the
empty sea, i began to think of tutok. i thought of all the times we had sat in the sun together. i could hear her voice and see
her black eyes squinting closed when she laughed.
below me, rontu was running along the cliff, barking at the screaming gulls. pelicans were chattering as they fished the blue
water. far off i could hear the bellow of a sea elephant. but suddenly, as i thought of tutok, the island seemed very quiet.

the hunters left many wounded otter behind them. some floated in and died on the shore and others i killed with my spear
since they were suffering and could not live. but i found a young otter that was not badly hurt.
it lay in a bed of bull kelp and i would ha

ve paddled by if rontu had not barked. a strand of kelp was wound around its body
and i thought it was sleeping, for often before they go to sleep they anchor themselves in this way to keep from drifting off.
then i saw there was a deep gash across its back.
the otter did not try to swim away as i drew near and reached over the side of the canoe. they have large eyes, especially
when they are young, but this one's were so large from fear and pain that i could see my refection in them. i cut the kelp that
held it and

the young otter now was the length of my arm and very glossy. it had a long nose that came to a point and many whiskers on
each side and the largest eyes i have ever seen. they would watch me all the time i was at the pool, following me whatever i
did, and when i said something, they would move around in a very funny way. in a way, too, that made pain come to my
throat because they were gay and sad also.
for a long time i called it otter as i had called rontu, dog. then i decided to give the otter a name. the name was mon-anee,
which means little boy with large eyes.
it was a hard task catching fish every day, especially if the wind was blowing and the waves were high. once when i could
catch only two and dropped them into the pool, mon-a-nee ate them quickly and waited for more. when he found that was all
i had he swam around in circles, looking at me reproachfully.
the waves were so high the next day that i could not fish on the reef even at low t

land.
nothing had been harmed except the fence, which i mended, and in a few days the house was the same as before. the only
thing that worried me was that all the abalones i had gathered in the summer were gone. i would need to live from day to day
on what i could catch, trying to get enough on the days when i could fish to last through the times when i could not. through
the first part of the winter, before mon-a- nee swam away, this was sometimes hard to do. afterwards it was not so hard and
rontu and i always had enough to eat.
while the aleuts were on the island, i had no chance to catch little smelts and dry them, so the nights that winter were dark
and i went to bed early and worked only during the day. but still i made another string for my fishing spear, many hooks of 
abalone shell, and last of all ear-rings to match the necklace tutok had given me.
these took a long time, for i searched the beach many mornings when the tide was out before i found two pebbles of the
same colour as

 the stones in the necklace and soft enough to cut. the holes in the ear-rings took even more time, for the
stones were hard to hold, but when i was done and had rubbed them bright in fine sand and water, and fastened them with
bone hooks to fit my ears, they were very pretty.
on sunny days i would wear them with my cormorant dress and the necklace, and walk along the cliff with rontu. i often
thought of tutok, but on these days especially i would look off into the north and wish that she were here to see me, i could
hear her talking in her strange language and i would make up things to say to her and things for her to say to me.

spring again was a time of flowers and water ran in the ravines and flowed down to the sea. many birds came back to the
island.
tainor and lurai built a nest in the tree where they were born. they built it of dry seaweed and leaves and also with

hairs off
rontu's back. whenever he was in the yard while it was being made, they would swoop down if he were not looking and
snatch a beakful of fur and fly away. this he did not like and he finally hid from them until the nest was finished.
i had been right in giving a girl's name to lurai, for she laid speckled eggs and, with some help from her mate, hatched two
ugly fledglings which soon became beautiful. i made up names for them and clipped their wings and before long they were as
tame as their parents.

aces are usually small and often i had watched a young one teetering on the edge of the nest and
wondered why it did not fall. they seldom did.
this one, which was white with a yellow beak, was not badly hurt, but he had a broken leg. i took him back to the house and
bound the bones together with two small sticks and sinew. for a while he did not try to walk. then, because he was not old
enough to fly, he began to hobble around the yard.
with the young birds and the old ones, the white gull and rontu, who was always trotting at my heels, the yard seemed a
happy place. if only i had not remembered tutok. if only i had not wondered about my sister ulape, where she was, and if 
the marks she had drawn upon her cheeks had proved magical. if they had, she was now married to kimki and was the
mother of many children. she would have smiled to see all of mine, which were so different from the ones i always wished to
have.
early that spring i started to gather abalones and i gathered many, taking th

 stored in the place 
beneath the headland, so if the hunters returned i would be ready to go to another part of the island, to move from cave to
cave, living in my canoe if necessary.
for many summers after the aleuts had gone the herd of otter left coral cove. the old otter which had survived the aleut
spears and by now were aware that summer was a time of danger would lead the herd away. they went far off to the kelp
beds of tall rock where they stayed until the first storms of winter.
often rontu and i would go out to the rock and live there for several days catching fish for won-a- me and the others i had
come to know.
one summer the otter did not leave, the summer that rontu died, and i knew then that none of the otter who remembered the
hunters were left. nor did i think of them often nor of the white men who had said they would come back, but did not come.
until that summer, i had kept count of all the moons since the time my brother and i were alone upon the island. for each one

at came and went i cut a mark in a pole beside the door of my house. 'there were many marks, from the roof to the floor.
but after that summer i did not cut them any more. the passing of the moons now had come to mean little, and i only made
marks to count the four seasons of the year. the last year i did not count those.
it was late in the summer that rontu died. the days since spring, whenever i went to the reef to fish, he would not go with me
unless i urged him to. he liked to lie in the sun in front of the house and i let him, but i did not go so often as in the past.
i remember the night that rontu stood at the fence and barked for me to let him out. usually he did this when the moon was
big, and he came back in the morning, but that night there was no moon and he did not return.
i waited all that day for him until almost dusk and then i went
 
 ___________________________
 
 out to look for him. i saw his tracks and followed them over
the dunes and a hill to the lair where he had once lived. there i found him, lying in the back of the cave, alone. at first i
thought that he had been hurt, yet there were no wounds on him. he touched my hand with his tongue, but only once and then
he was quiet and scarcely breathed.
since night had fallen and it was too dark for me to carry rontu back, i stayed there. i sat beside him through the night and
talked to him. at dawn i took him in my arms and left the cave. he was very light, as if something about him had already
gone.
the sun was up as i went along the cliff. gulls were crying in the sky. he raised his ears at the sound, and i put him down, 
thinking that he wished to bark at them as he always did. he raised his head and followed them with his eyes, but did not
make a sound.
'rontu,' i said, ‘you have always liked to bark

 at the seagulls. whole mornings and afternoons you have barked at them. bark
at them now for me.
but he did not look at them again. slowly he walked to where i was standing and fell at my feet. i put my hand on his chest. i
could feel his heart beating, but it beat only twice, very slowly, loud and hollow like the waves on the beach, and then no
more.
'rontu,' i cried, 'oh, rontu!'
i buried him on the headland. i dug a hole in the crevice of the rock, digging for two days from dawn until the going down of
the sun, and put him there with some sand flowers and a stick he liked to chase when i threw it, and covered him with pebbles
of many colours that i gathered on the shore.

that winter i did not go to the reef at all. i ate the things i had stored and left the house only to get water at the spring. it was
a winter of strong winds and rain and wild seas that crashed a

gainst the cliffs, so i would not have gone out much even if
rontu had been there. during that time i made four snares from notched branches.
in the summer once, when i was on my way to the place where the sea elephants lived, i had seen a young dog that looked
like rontu. he was running with one of the packs of wild dogs, and though i: caught only a glimpse of him, i was sure he was
rontu's son.
he was larger than the other dogs and had heavier fur and yellow eyes and he ran with a graceful stride like rontu's. in the
spring i planned to catch him with the snares i was making. 
the wild dogs came to the headland often during the winter, now that rontu was gone, and when the worst of the storms
were over i set the snares outside the fence and baited them with fish. i caught several of the dogs the first time, but not the
one with the yellow eyes, and since i was afraid to handle

he fence and tied him to it with a thong and left food beside him to eat and some
fresh water. before long he was on his feet, gnawing through the thong. he howled and ran about the yard while i cooked my
supper. all night he howled, but at dawn when i went out of the house, he was asleep.
while he lay there by the fence sleeping, i thought of different names for him, trying first one and then another, saying them 
over to myself. at last, because he looked so much like his father, i called him rontu-aru, which means son of rontu.
in a short time he made friends with me. he was not so large as rontu, but he had his father's thick coat and the same yellow
eyes. often when i watched him chasing gulls on the sandpits or on the reef barking at the otter, i forgot that he was not
rontu.
we had many happy times that summer, fishing and going to tall rock in our canoe, but more and more now i thought of
tutok and my sister ulape. sometimes i would hear their voices in the wind and often, when i wa

s on the sea, in the waves
that lapped softly against the canoe.
27
after the fierce storms of winter came many days when the wind did not blow. the air was so heavy that it was hard to
breathe and the sun so hot that the sea was like a sun itself, too bright to look at.
the last day of this weather i took the canoe from the cave and paddled around the reef to the sandpits. i did not take rontuaru
with me, for while he liked the cold he did not like heat. it was good that he did not come with me. the day was the
hottest of all and the sea shimmered with red light. over my eyes i wore shields made of wood with small slits in them to see
through. no gulls were flying, the otter lay quiet in the kelp, and the little crabs were deep in their holes.
i pulled the canoe upon the beach, which was wet but steaming from the sun. early every spring i took the canoe to the
sandpits and spread fre

 and though j was afraid to leave the cliff i knew that i could never stay there until morning, that i would go to
sleep and fall. neither could i find my way home, so i climbed down from the ledge and crouched at the foot of the cliff.
dawn was windless and hot. the sandpits was strewn with hills of kelp. dead fish and lobsters and pink crabs lay
everywhere, and two small whales were stranded against the rock walls of the cove. far up the trail that led to the mesa i
found things from the sea.
rontu-aru was waiting at the fence. when i crawled under it he jumped upon me and followed me around, never letting me
out of his sight.
i was glad to be home on the high headland where the waves had not come. i had been gone only from one sun to the next,
yet it was like many suns, like the time i had gone away in the canoe. most of the day i slept, but i had many dreams and
when i awoke everything around me was strange. the sea made no sounds on the shore. the gulls were quiet. the earth
seemed to

be holding its breath, as though it were waiting for something terrible to happen.
at dusk i was coming back from the spring with a basket of water on my shoulder, walking along the cliff with rontu-aru.
everywhere, the ocean was smooth and yellow and it lay against the island as if it were very tired. the gulls were still quiet,
perched on their rocky nests.
slowly the earth began to move. it moved away from my feet and for a moment i seemed to be standing in the air. water
tipped out of the basket and trickled over my face. then the basket fell to the ground. not knowing what i did, thinking
foolishly that' another wave was upon me, i began to run. but it was a wave, a wave of earth, and

 it rippled under me along
the cliff.
as i ran another wave overtook me. looking back i saw many of them coming out of the south like waves in the sea. the
next thing i remember i was lying on the ground and rontu-an was beside me and we were both trying to get to our feet.
then we were running again towards the headland, towards a house that kept moving off into the distance.
the opening under the fence had caved in and i had to pull the rocks away before we could crawl through. night came, but
the earth still rose and fell like a great animal breathing. i could hear rocks tumbling from the cliff, falling down into the sea.
all night as we lay there in the house the earth trembled and rocks fell, yet no

d into the water
and came along the beach and up the trail.
i could not see him, but after a while i heard a shout, then another, and i knew that he had found my fire and the canoe. the
man he had left in the cove did not answer, nor did the men on the ship, so i was sure that he was calling to me.
i crawled down from the rock and went to the house. since my shoulders were bare, i put on my otter cape. i took my
cormorant skirt and the abalone box in which i kept my necklace and ear-rings. with rontu-aru i then went along the trail
that led to coral cove. 
i came to the mound where my ancestors had sometimes camped in the summer. i thought of them and of the happy times
spent in my house on the headland, of my canoe lying unfinished beside the trail. i thought of many things, but stronger was
the wish to be where people lived, to hear their voices and their laughter.
i left the mound and the green grass growing on it among the white shells. i could no longer hear the man calling, so i began

 black stones and the black ear-rings. with blue clay i made the mark of our
tribe across my nose.
then i did something that made me smile at myself. i did what my older sister ulape had done when she left the island of the
blue dolphins. below the mark of our tribe i carefully made the sign which meant that i was still unmarried. i was no longer
a girl, yet i made it anyway, using the blue clay and some white clay for the dots.
i went back to the house then and built a fire and cooked food for rontu-aru and me. i was not hungry and he ate my food 
and his too.
'we are going away,' i said to him, 'away from our island.'
but he only put his head to one side, as his father often had done, and when i said no more, he trotted out to a sunny place
and. lay down and fell asleep.
now that the white men had come back, i could not think of what i would do when i went across the sea, or make a picture in
my mind of the white men and what they did there, or see my people who had been gone so long. nor

him that this ship had sunk in a great storm soon after it reached his country and that on the whole ocean thereabouts there
was no other. for this reason the white men had not come back for me.
on the tenth day we sailed. it was a morning of blue skies and no wind. we went straight towards the sun.
for a long time i stood and looked back at the island of the blue dolphins. the last thing i saw of it was the high headland. i
thought of rontu lying there beneath the stones of many colours, and of won-a-nee, wherever she was, and the little red fox
that would scratch in vain at my fence, and my canoe hidden in the cave, and of all the happy days. 
dolphins rose out of the sea and swam before the ship. they swam for many leagues in the morning through the bright water,
weaving their foam patterns. the little birds were chirping in their cage and rontu-aru sat beside me.
