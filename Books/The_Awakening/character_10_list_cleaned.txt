the [CHARACTER] - 
                the [CHARACTER] is a vacationer at the lebrun cottages
on grand isle. she embodies the patient, resigned solitude that
convention expects of a woman whose husband has died, but her solitude
does not speak to any sort of independence or strength. rather, it
owes to a self-effacing withdrawal from life and passion out of
utter respect for her husband's death. throughout the novel, the
[CHARACTER] remains silent, which contributes to her lack of individuality
and to her role within the text as the symbol of the socially acceptable
husbandless woman.
