it was full as heavy and as long as this, seven
christmas eves ago. you have laboured on it, since.
it is a ponderous chain!"

scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the
expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty
or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see
nothing.

"jacob," he said, imploringly. "old jacob marley,
tell me more. speak comfort to me, jacob!"

"i have none to give," the ghost replied. "it comes
from other regions, ebenezer scrooge, and is conveyed
by other ministers, to other kinds of men. nor
can i tell you what i would. a very little more is
all permitted to me. i cannot rest, i cannot stay, i
cannot linger anywhere. my spirit never walked
beyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my
spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our
money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before
me!"

it was a habit with scrooge, whenever he became
thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.

bliged to rub
the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he
could see anything; and could see very little then. all he
could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely
cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,
and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been
if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the
world.  this was a great relief, because "three days after sight
of this first of exchange pay to mr. ebenezer scrooge or his
order," and so forth, would have become a mere united states'
security if there were no days to count by.

scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought
it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  the more he
thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured
not to think, the more he thought.

marley's ghost bothered him exceedingly. every time he resolved
within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his
mind fle

 are they shadows of
things that may be, only?"

still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which
it stood.

"men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if
persevered in, they must lead," said scrooge. "but if the
courses be departed from, the ends will change. say it is
thus with what you show me!"

the spirit was immovable as ever.

scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and
following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected
grave his own name, ebenezer scrooge.

"am i that man who lay upon the bed?" he cried, upon
his knees.

the finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.

"no, spirit! oh no, no!"

the finger still was there.

"spirit!" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, "hear me!
i am not the man i was. i will not be the man i must
have been but for this intercourse. why show me this, if i
am past all hope!"

for the first time the hand appeared to shake.

"good spirit," he pursued, as down upon the ground he
