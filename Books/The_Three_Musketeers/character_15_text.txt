 appearance of affectation,
and asked dâ€™artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever
been in england.

dâ€™artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by m. de treville to
treat for a supply of horses, and that he had brought back four as
specimens.

milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips;
she had to deal with a gascon who played close.

at the same hour as on the preceding evening, dâ€™artagnan retired. in the
corridor he again met the pretty kitty; that was the name of the
soubrette. she looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was
impossible to mistake; but dâ€™artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress
that he noticed absolutely nothing but her.

dâ€™artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that, and each day
milady gave him a more gracious reception.

every evening, either in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the
stairs, he met the pretty soubrette. but, as we have said, dâ€™artagnan
paid no attention to th

32 a procuratorâ€™s dinner


however brilliant had been the part played by porthos in the duel, it
had not made him forget the dinner of the procuratorâ€™s wife.

on the morrow he received the last touches of mousquetonâ€™s brush for an
hour, and took his way toward the rue aux ours with the steps of a man
who was doubly in favor with fortune.

his heart beat, but not like dâ€™artagnanâ€™s with a young and impatient
love. no; a more material interest stirred his blood. he was about at
last

istress


meantime, as we have said, despite the cries of his conscience and the
wise counsels of athos, dâ€™artagnan became hourly more in love with
milady. thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her; and the
self-satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not
fail to respond.

one day, when he arrived with his head in the air, and as light at heart
as a man who awaits a shower of gold, he found the soubrette under the
gateway of the hotel; but this time the pretty kitty was not contented
with touching him as he passed, she took him gently by the hand.

"good!" thought dâ€™artagnan, "she is charged with some message for me
from her mistress; she is about to appoint some rendezvous of which she
had not courage to speak." and he looked down at the pretty girl with
the most triumphant air imaginable.

"i wish to say three words to you, monsieur chevalier," stammered the
soubrette.

"speak, my child, speak," said dâ€™artagnan; "i listen."

"here? impossible! that w
 
 ___________________________
 
hich i have to say is too long, and above all,
too secret."

"well, what is to be done?"

"if monsieur chevalier would follow me?" said kitty, timidly.

"where you please, my dear child."

"come, then."

and kitty, who had not let go the hand of dâ€™artagnan, led him up a
little dark, winding staircase, and after ascending about fifteen steps,
opened a door.

"come in here, monsieur chevalier," said she; "here we shall be alone,
and can talk."

"and whose room is this, my dear child?"

"it is mine, monsieur chevalier; it communicates with my mistressâ€™s by
that door. but you need not fear. she will not hear what we say; she
never goes to bed before midnight."

dâ€™artagnan cast a glance around him. the 
 
 ___________________________
 
little apartment was charming
for its taste and neatness; but in spite of himself, his eyes were
directed to that door which kitty said led to miladyâ€™s chamber.

kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man, and heaved
a deep sigh.

"you love my mistress, then, very dearly, monsieur chevalier?" said she.

"oh, more than i can say, kitty! i am mad for her!"

kitty breathed a second sigh.

"alas, monsieur," said she, "that is too bad."

"what the devil do you see so bad in it?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"because, monsieur," replied kitty, "my mistress loves you not at all."

"hein!" said dâ€™artagnan, "can she have charged you to tell me so?"

"oh, no, monsieur; but out of the regard i have for you, i have taken
the resolution to tell you so."

"much obliged, my dear kitty; but for the intention only--for the
information, you must agree, is not likely to be at 
 
 ___________________________
 
all agreeable."

"that is to say, you donâ€™t believe what i have told you; is it not so?"

"we have always some difficulty in believing such things, my pretty
dear, were it only from self-love."

"then you donâ€™t believe me?"

"i confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you
advance--"

"what do you think of this?"

kitty drew a little note from her bosom.

"for me?" said dâ€™artagnan, seizing the letter.

"no; for another."

"for another?"

"yes."

"his name; his name!" cried dâ€™artagnan.

"read the address."

"monsieur el comte de wardes."

the remembrance of the scene at st. germain presented itself to the mind
of the presumptuous gascon. as quick as thought, he tore open the
letter, in spite of the cry which kitty uttered on seeing what he was
going to do, or rather, what he was doing.

"oh, good lord, mons
 
 ___________________________
 
ieur chevalier," said she, "what are you doing?"

"i?" said dâ€™artagnan; "nothing," and he read,

"you have not answered my first note. are you indisposed, or have you
forgotten the glances you favored me with at the ball of mme. de guise?
you have an opportunity now, count; do not allow it to escape."

dâ€™artagnan became very pale; he was wounded in his self-love: he thought
that it was in his love.

"poor dear monsieur dâ€™artagnan," said kitty, in a voice full of
compassion, and pressing anew the young manâ€™s hand.

"you pity me, little one?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"oh, yes, and with all my heart; for i know what it is to be in love."

"you know what it is to be in love?" said dâ€™artagnan, looking at her for
the first time with much attention.

"alas, yes."

"well, then, instead of pitying me, you would do much better to assist
me in avenging myself on your mistress."

"and what sort of revenge would you take?"

"i would triumph over

her, and supplant my rival."

"i will never help you in that, monsieur chevalier," said kitty, warmly.

"and why not?" demanded dâ€™artagnan.

"for two reasons."

"what ones?"

"the first is that my mistress will never love you."

"how do you know that?"

"you have cut her to the heart."

"i? in what can i have offended her--i who ever since i have known her
have lived at her feet like a slave? speak, i beg you!"

"i will never confess that but to the man--who should read to the bottom
of my soul!"

dâ€™artagnan looked at kitty for the second time. the young girl had
freshness and beaut

y which many duchesses would have purchased with
their coronets.

"kitty," said he, "i will read to the bottom of your soul when-ever you
like; donâ€™t let that disturb you." and he gave her a kiss at which the
poor girl became as red as a cherry.

"oh, no," said kitty, "it is not me you love! it is my mistress you
love; you told me so just now."

"and does that hinder you from letting me know the second reason?"

"the second reason, monsieur the chevalier," replied kitty, emboldened
by the kiss in the first place, and still further by the expression of
the eyes of the young man, "is that in love, everyone for herself!"

then only dâ€™artagnan remembered the languishing glances of kitty, her
constantly meeting him in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the
stairs, those touches of the hand every time she met him, and her deep
sighs; but absorbed by his desire to please the great lady, he had
disdained the soubrette. he whose game is the eagle takes no heed of t

sparrow.

but this time our gascon saw at a glance all the advantage to be derived
from the love which kitty had just confessed so innocently, or so
boldly: the interception of letters addressed to the comte de wardes,
news on the spot, entrance at all hours into kittyâ€™s chamber, which was
contiguous to her mistressâ€™s. the perfidious deceiver was, as may
plainly be perceived, already sacrificing, in intention, the poor girl
in order to obtain milady, willy-nilly.

"well," said he to the young girl, "are you willing, my dear kitty, that
i should give you a proof of that love which you doubt?"

"what love?" asked the young girl.

"of that which i am ready to feel toward you."

"and what is that proof?"

"are you willing that i should this evening pass with 
 
 ___________________________
 
you the time i
generally spend with your mistress?"

"oh, yes," said kitty, clapping her hands, "very willing."

"well, then, come here, my dear," said dâ€™artagnan, establishing himself
in an easy chair; "come, and let me tell you that you are the prettiest
soubrette i ever saw!"

and he did tell her so much, and so well, that the poor girl, who asked
nothing better than to believe him, did believe him. nevertheless, to
dâ€™artagnanâ€™s great astonishment, the pretty kitty defended herself
resolutely.

time passes quickly when it is passed in attacks and defenses. midnight
sounded, and almost at the same time the bell was rung in miladyâ€™s
chamber.

"good god," cried kitty, "there is my mistress calling me! go; go
directly!"

dâ€™artagnan rose, took his hat, as if it had been his intention to obey,
then, opening quickly the door of a large closet instead of that leading
to the staircase, he buried himself amid the robes and dressing gowns of
milady.

"what are y
 
 ___________________________
 
ou doing?" cried kitty.

dâ€™artagnan, who had secured the key, shut himself up in the closet
without reply.

"well," cried milady, in a sharp voice. "are you asleep, that you donâ€™t
answer when i ring?"

and dâ€™artagnan heard the door of communication opened violently.

"here am i, milady, here am i!" cried kitty, springing forward to meet
her mistress.

both went into the bedroom, and as the door of communication remained
open, dâ€™artagnan could hear milady for some time scolding her maid. she
was at length appeased, and the conversation turned upon him while kitty
was assisting her mistress.

"well," said milady, "i have not seen our gascon this evening."

"what, milady! has he not come?" said kitty. "can he be inconstant
before being happy?"

"oh, no; he must have been prevented by monsieur de trevi

lle or monsieur
dessessart. i understand my game, kitty; i have this one safe."

"what will you do with him, madame?"

"what will i do with him? be easy, kitty, there is something between
that man and me that he is quite ignorant of: he nearly made me lose my
credit with his eminence. oh, i will be revenged!"

"i believed that madame loved him."

"i love him? i detest him! an idiot, who held the life of lord de winter
in his hands and did not kill him, by which i missed three hundred
thousand livresâ€™ income."

"thatâ€™s true," said kitty; "your son was the only heir of his uncle, and
until his majority you would have had the enjoyment of his fortune
 
 ___________________________
 
not conciliated that little woman he was so
fond of."

"what, the mercerâ€™s wife of the rue des fossoyeurs? has he not already
forgotten she ever existed? fine vengeance that, on my faith!"

a cold sweat broke from dâ€™artagnanâ€™s brow. why, this woman was a
monster! he resumed his listening, but unfortunately the toilet was
finished.

"that will do," said milady; "go into your own room, and tomorrow
endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter i gave you."

"for monsieur de wardes?" said kitty.

"to be sure; for monsieur de wardes."

"now, there is one," said kitty, "who appears to me quite a different
sort of a man from that poor monsieur dâ€™artagnan."

"go to bed, mademoiselle," said milady; "i donâ€™t like comments."

dâ€™artagnan heard the door close; then the noise of two bolts by which
milady fastened herself in. on her side, but as softly as possible,
kitty turned the key of the lock, and then dâ€™artagnan opened the closet
door.

"oh, good lord!" said kitty, in a low voice, 
 
 ___________________________
 
"what is the matter with
you? how pale you are!"

"the abominable creature," murmured dâ€™artagnan.

"silence, silence, begone!" said kitty. "there is nothing but a wainscot
between my chamber and miladyâ€™s; every word that is uttered in one can
be heard in the other."

"thatâ€™s exactly the reason i wonâ€™t go," said dâ€™artagnan.

"what!" said kitty, blushing.

"or, at least, i will go--later."

he drew kitty to him. she had the less motive to resist, resistance
would make so much noise. therefore kitty surrendered.

it was a movement of vengeance upon milady. dâ€™artagnan believed it right
to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods. with a little more
heart, he might have been contented with this new conquest; but the
principal features of his character were ambition and pride. it must,
however, be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of
his influence over kitty was to t

ry and find out what had become of mme.
bonacieux; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to dâ€™artagnan that
she was entirely ignorant on that head, her mistress never admitting her
into half her secrets--only she believed she could say she was not dead.

as to the cause which was near making milady lose her credit with the
cardinal, kitty knew nothing about it; but this time dâ€™artagnan was
better informed than she was. as he had seen milady on board a vessel at
the moment he was leaving england, he suspected that it was, almost
without a doubt, on account of the diamond studs.

but what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred, the profound
hatred, the inveterate hatred of milady, was increased by his not having
killed her brother-in-law.

dâ€™artagnan came the next day to miladyâ€™s, and finding her in a very
ill-hum

or, had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from m. de wardes
that provoked her thus. kitty came in, but milady was very cross with
her. the poor girl ventured a glance at dâ€™artagnan which said, "see how
i suffer on your account!"

toward the end of the evening, however, the beautiful lioness became
milder; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of dâ€™artagnan, and
even gave him her hand to kiss.

dâ€™artagnan departed, scarcely knowing what to think, but as he was a
youth who did not easily lose his head, while continuing to pay his
court to milady, he had framed a little pla
 
 ___________________________
 
n in his mind.

he found kitty at the gate, and, as on the preceding evening, went up to
her chamber. kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded.
milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the comte de wardes,
and she ordered kitty to come at nine oâ€™clock in the morning to take a
third letter.

dâ€™artagnan made kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following
morning. the poor girl promised all her lover desired; she was mad.

things passed as on the night before. dâ€™artagnan concealed himself in
his closet; milady called, undressed, sent away kitty, and shut the
door. as the night before, dâ€™artagnan did not return home till five
oâ€™clock in the morning.

at eleven oâ€™clock kitty came to him. she held in her hand a fresh billet
from milady. this time the poor girl did not even argue with dâ€™art
 
 ___________________________
 
 soul to her handsome
soldier.

dâ€™artagnan opened the letter and read as follows:

this is the third time i have written to you to tell you that i love
you. beware that i do not write to you a fourth time to tell you that i
detest you.

if you repent of the manner in which you have acted toward me, the young
girl who brings you this will tell you how a man of spirit may obtain
his pardon.

dâ€™artagnan colored and grew pale several times in reading this billet.

"oh, you love her still," said kitty, who had not taken her eyes off the
young manâ€™s countenance for an instant.

"no, kitty, you are mistaken. i do not love her, but i will avenge
myself for her contempt."

"oh, yes, i know what sort of vengeance! you told me that!"

"what matters it to you, kitty? you know it is you alone whom i love."

"how can i know that?"

"by the scorn i will throw upon her."

dâ€™artagnan took a pen and wrote:

madame, until the present moment i could not believe that it was to me
your first two letters

resent manners, something
like an infamous action; but at that period people did not manage
affairs as they do today. besides, dâ€™artagnan from her own admission
knew milady culpable of treachery in matters more important, and could
entertain no respect for her. and yet, notwithstanding this want of
respect, he felt an uncontrollable passion for this woman boiling in his
veins--passion drunk with contempt; but passion or thirst, as the reader
pleases.

dâ€™artagnanâ€™s plan was very simple. by kittyâ€™s chamber he could gain that
of her mistress. he would take advantage of the first moment of
surprise, shame, and terror, to triumph over her. he might fail, but
something must be left to chance. in eight days the campaign would open,
and he would be compelled to leave paris; dâ€™artagnan had no time for a
prolonged love siege.

"there," said the young man, handing kitty the letter sealed; "give that
to milady. it is the countâ€™s reply."

poor kitty became as pale as death; she suspected wha

t the letter
contained.

"listen, my dear girl," said dâ€™artagnan; "you cannot but perceive that
all this must end, some way or other. milady may discover that you gave
the first billet to my lackey instead of to the countâ€™s; that it is i
who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de wardes.
milady will then turn you out of doors, and you know she is not the
woman to limit her vengeance."

"alas!" said kitty, "for whom have i exposed myself to all that?"

"for me, i well know, my sweet girl," said dâ€™artagnan. "but i am
grateful, i swear to you."

"but what does this note contain?"

"milady will tell you."

"ah, you do not love me!" cried kitty, "and i am very wretched."

to this reproach there is always one response which deludes women.
dâ€™artagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great
delusion. although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the
letter to her mistress,
 
 ___________________________
 
 she did at last so decide, which was all
dâ€™artagnan wished. finally he promised that he would leave her
mistressâ€™s presence at an early hour that evening, and that when he left
the mistress he would ascend with the maid. this promise completed poor
kittyâ€™s consolation.




34 in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of


since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there
had been no fixed meeting between them. they dined apart from one
another, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could.
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was
gliding away so rapidly--only they had agreed to meet once a week, about
one oâ€™clock, at the residence of athos, seeing that he, i
 
 ___________________________
 
n agreement
with the vow he had formed, did not pass over the threshold of his door.

this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find
dâ€™artagnan. soon as kitty left him, dâ€™artagnan directed his steps toward
the rue ferou.

he found athos and aramis philosophizing. aramis had some slight
inclination to resume the cassock. athos, according to his system,
neither encouraged nor dissuaded him. athos believed that everyone
should be left to his own free will. he never gave advice but when it
was asked, and even then he required to be asked twice.

"people, in general," he said, "only ask advice not to follow it; or if
they do follow it, it is for the sak

walked away, "it appears i am
getting nearer to monsieur coquenardâ€™s strongbox at last."




35 a gascon a match for cupid


the evening so impatiently waited for by porthos and by dâ€™artagnan at
last arrived.

as was his custom, dâ€™artagnan presented himself at miladyâ€™s at about
nine oâ€™clock. he found her in a charming humor. never had he been so
well received. our gascon knew, by the first glance of his eye, that his
billet had been delivered, and that this billet had had its effect.

kitty entered to bring some sherbet. her mistress put on a charming
face, and smiled on her graciously; but alas! the poor girl was so sad
that she did not even notice miladyâ€™s condescension.

dâ€™artagnan looked at the two women, one after the other, and was forced
to acknowledge that in his opinion dame nature had made a mistake in
their formation. to the great lady she had given a heart vile and venal;
to the soubrette she had given the heart of a duchess.

at ten oâ€™clock milady began to appea
 
 ___________________________
 
€™artagnan knew what she
wanted. she looked at the clock, rose, reseated herself, smiled at
dâ€™artagnan with an air which said, "you are very amiable, no doubt, but
you would be charming if you would only depart."

dâ€™artagnan rose and took his hat; milady gave him her hand to kiss. the
young man felt her press his hand, and comprehended that this was a
sentiment, not of coquetry, but of gratitude because of his departure.

"she loves him devilishly," he murmured. then he went out.

this time kitty was nowhere waiting for him; neither in the antechamber,
nor in the corridor, nor beneath the great door. it was necessary that
dâ€™artagnan should find alone the staircase and the little chamber. she
heard him enter, but she did not raise her head. the young man went to
her and took her hands; then she sobbed aloud.

as dâ€™artagnan had presumed, on receiving his letter, milady in a
delirium of joy had told her servant everything; and by way of
recompense for the manner in which she had this t
 
 ___________________________
 
ime executed the
commission, she had given kitty a purse.

returning to her own room, kitty had thrown the purse into a corner,
where it lay open, disgorging three or four gold pieces on the carpet.
the poor girl, under the caresses of dâ€™artagnan, lifted her head.
dâ€™artagnan himself was frightened by the change in her countenance. she
joined her hands with a suppliant air, but without venturing to speak a
word. as little sensitive as was the heart of dâ€™artagnan, he was touched
by this mute sorrow; but he held too tenaciously to his projects, above
all to this one, to change the 
 
 ___________________________
 
program which he had laid out in advance.
he did not therefore allow her any hope that he would flinch; only he
represented his action as one of simple vengeance.

for the rest this vengeance was very easy; for milady, doubtless to
conceal her blushes from her lover, had ordered kitty to extinguish all
the lights in the apartment, and even in the little chamber itself.
before daybreak m. de wardes must take his departure, still in
obscurity.

presently they heard milady retire to her room. dâ€™artagnan slipped into
the wardrobe. hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded.
kitty went to her mistress, and did not leave the door open; but the
partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between
the two women.

milady seemed overcome with joy, and m
 
 ___________________________
 
ade kitty repeat the smallest
details of the pretended interview of the soubrette with de wardes when
he received the letter; how he had responded; what was the expression of
his face; if he seemed very amorous. and to all these questions poor
kitty, forced to put on a pleasant face, responded in a stifled voice
whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark, solely
because happiness is egotistical.

finally, as the hour for her interview with the count approached, milady
had everything about her darkened, and ordered kitty to return to her
own chamber, and introduce de wardes whenever he presented himself.

kittyâ€™s detention was not long. hardly had dâ€™artagnan seen, through a
crevice in his closet, that the whole apartment 
 
 ___________________________
 
was in obscurity, than
he slipped out of his concealment, at the very moment when kitty
reclosed the door of communication.

"what is that noise?" demanded milady.

"it is i," said dâ€™artagnan in a subdued voice, "i, the comte de wardes."

"oh, my god, my god!" murmured kitty, "he has not even waited for the
hour he himself named!"

"well," said milady, in a trembling voice, "why do you not enter? count,
count," added she, "you know that i wait for you."

at this appeal dâ€™artagnan drew kitty quietly away, and slipped into the
chamber.

if rage or sorrow ever torture the heart, it is when a lover receives
under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his
happy rival. dâ€™artagnan was in a dolorous situation which he had not
foreseen. jealousy gnawed his heart; and he suffered almost as much as
poor kitty, who at that very moment was crying in the next chamber.

"yes, count," said milady, in her softest voice, and pressing his hand
in her own, "i am happy in th

 hated and adored her at the same time. he would not have
believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart,
and by their union constitute a passion so strange, and as it were,
diabolical.

presently it sounded one oâ€™clock. it was necessary to separate.
dâ€™artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest
regret at the parting; and as they addressed each other in a
reciprocally passionate adieu, another interview was arranged for the
following week.

poor kitty hoped to speak a few words to dâ€™artagnan when he passed
through her chamber; but milady herself reconducted him through the
darkness, and only quit him at the staircase.

the next morning dâ€™artagnan ran to find athos. he was engaged in an
adventure so singular that he wished for counsel. he therefore told him
all.

"your milady," said he, "appears to be an infamous creature, but not the
less you have done wrong to deceive her. in one fashion or another you
have a terrible enemy on your hand
 
 ___________________________
 
u have the courage?" said athos.

"i shall," replied dâ€™artagnan, "and instantly."

"in truth, my young friend, you will act rightly," said the gentleman,
pressing the gasconâ€™s hand with an affection almost paternal; "and god
grant that this woman, who has scarcely entered into your life, may not
leave a terrible trace in it!" and athos bowed to dâ€™artagnan like a man
who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone
with his thoughts.

on reaching home dâ€™artagnan found kitty waiting for him. a month of
fever could not have changed her more than this one night of
sleeplessness and sorrow.

she was sent by her mistress to the false de wardes. her mistress was
mad with love, intoxicated with joy. she wished to know when her lover
would meet her a second night; and poor kitty, pale and trembling,
awaited dâ€™artagnanâ€™s reply. the counsels of his friend, joined to the
cries of his own heart, made him determine, now his pride was saved and
his vengeance satisfied, not

 sapphire. was the gascon determined to keep it as a
weapon against milady, or else, let us be frank, did he not reserve the
sapphire as a last resource for his outfit? it would be wrong to judge
the actions of one period from the point of view of another. that which
would now be considered as disgraceful to a gentleman was at that time
quite a simple and natural affair, and the younger sons of the best
families were frequently supported by their mistresses. dâ€™artagnan gave
the open letter to kitty, who at first was unable to comprehend it, but
who became almost wild with joy on reading it a second time. she could
scarcely believe in her happiness; and dâ€™artagnan was forced to renew
with the living voice the assurances which he had written. and whatever
might be--considering the violent character of milady--the danger which
the poor girl incurred in giving this billet to her mistress, she ran
back to the place royale as fast as her legs could carry her.

the heart of the best woman is p
 
 ___________________________
 
itiless toward the sorrows of a rival.

milady opened the letter with eagerness equal to kittyâ€™s in bringing it;
but at the first words she read she became livid. she crushed the paper
in her hand, and turning with flashing eyes upon kitty, she cried, "what
is this letter?"

"the answer to madameâ€™s," replied kitty, all in a tremble.

"impossible!" cried milady. "it is impossible a gentleman could have
written such a letter to a woman." then all at once, starting, she
cried, "my god! can he have--" and she stopped. she ground her teeth;
she was of the color of ashes. she tried to go toward the window for
air, but she could only stretch forth her arms; her legs failed her, and
she sank into an armchair. kitty, fearing she was ill, hastened toward
her and was beginning to open her dress; but milady started 
 
 ___________________________
 
up, pushing
her away. "what do you want with me?" said she, "and why do you place
your hand on me?"

"i thought that madame was ill, and i wished to bring her help,"
responded the maid, frightened at the terrible expression which had come
over her mistressâ€™s face.

"i faint? i? i? do you take me for half a woman? when i am insulted i do
not faint; i avenge myself!"

and she made a sign for kitty to leave the room.




36 dream of vengeance


that evening milady gave orders that when m. dâ€™artagnan came as usual,
he should be immediately admitted; but he did not come.

the next day kitty went to see the young man again, and related to him
all that had passed on the preceding evening. dâ€™artagnan smiled; this
jealous anger of milady was his revenge.

that evening milady was still more impatient than on the preceding
evening. she renewed the order relative to the gascon; but as before s

expected him in vain.

the next morning, when kitty presented herself at dâ€™artagnanâ€™s, she was
no longer joyous and alert as on the two preceding days; but on the
contrary sad as death.

dâ€™artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her; but she, as
her only reply, drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him.

this letter was in miladyâ€™s handwriting; only this time it was addressed
to m. dâ€™artagnan, and not to m. de wardes.

he opened it and read as follows:

dear m. dâ€™artagnan, it is wrong thus to neglect your friends

,
particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a
time. my brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day
before, but in vain. will it be the same this evening?

your very grateful, milady clarik

"thatâ€™s all very simple," said dâ€™artagnan; "i expected this letter. my
credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes."

"and will you go?" asked kitty.

"listen to me, my dear girl," said the gascon, who sought for an excuse
in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made athos; "you must
understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive
invitation. milady, not seeing me come again, would not be able to
understand what could cause the interruption of my visits, and might
suspect something; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman
would go?"

"oh, my god!" said kitty, "you know how to represent things in such a
way
 
 ___________________________
 
 that you are always in the right. you are going now to pay your
court to her again, and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your
own name and with your own face, it will be much worse than before."

instinct made poor kitty guess a part of what was to happen. dâ€™artagnan
reassured her as well as he could, and promised to remain insensible to
the seductions of milady.

he desired kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful
for her kindnesses than he was, and that he would be obedient to her
orders. he did not dare to write for fear of not being able--to such
experienced eyes as those of milady--to disguise his writing
sufficiently.

as nine oâ€™clock sounded, dâ€™artagnan was at the place royale. it was
evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned, for
as soon as dâ€™artagnan appeared, before even he had asked if milady were
visible, o

 hope?"

milady answered by a glance which said, "is that all?--speak, then." and
then accompanying the glance with explanatory words, "that is but too
just," said she, tenderly.

"oh, you are an angel!" exclaimed the young man.

"then all is agreed?" said she.

"except that which i ask of you, dear love."

"but when i assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?"

"i cannot wait till tomorrow."

"silence! i hear my brother. it will be useless for him to find you
here."

she rang the bell and kitty appeared.

"go out this way," said she, opening a small private door, "and come
back at eleven oâ€™clock; we will then terminate this conversation. kitty
will conduct you to my chamber."

the poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words.

"well, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a
statue? do as i bid you: show the chevalier out; and this evening at
eleven oâ€™clock--you have heard what i said."

"it appears that these appointments are all made for eleven oâ€™cloc

k,"
thought dâ€™artagnan; "thatâ€™s a settled custom."

milady held out her hand to him, which he kissed tenderly.

"but," said he, as he retired as quickly as possible from the reproaches
of kitty, "i must not play the fool. this woman is certainly a great
liar. i must take care."




37 miladyâ€™s secret


dâ€™artagnan left the hotel instead of going up at once to kittyâ€™s
chamber, as she endeavored to persuade him to do--and that for two
reasons: the first, because by this means he should escape reproaches,
recriminations, and prayers; the second, because he was not sorry to
have an opportunity of reading his own thoughts and endeavoring, if
possible, to fathom those of this woman.

what was most clear in the matter was that dâ€™artagnan loved milady like
a madman, and that she did not love him at all. in an instant dâ€™artagnan
perceived that the best way i

le, turning at every
ten steps to look at the light in miladyâ€™s apartment, which was to be
seen through the blinds. it was evident that this time the young woman
was not in such haste to retire to her apartment as she had been the
first.

at length the light disappeared. with this light was extinguished the
last irresolution in the heart of dâ€™artagnan. he recalled to his mind
the details of the first night, and with a beating heart and a brain on
fire he re-entered the hotel and flew toward kittyâ€™s chamber.

the poor girl, pale as death and trembling in all her limbs, wished to
delay her lover; but milady, with her ear on the watch, had heard the
noise dâ€™artagnan had made, and opening the door, said, "come in."

all this was of such incredible immodesty, of such monstrous effrontery,
that dâ€™artagnan could scarcely believe what he saw or what he heard. he
imagined himself to be drawn into one of those fantastic intrigues one
meets in dreams. he, however, darted not the less quickly

 toward milady,
yielding to that magnetic attraction which the loadstone exercises over
iron.

as the door closed after them kitty rushed toward it. jealousy, fury,
offended pride, all the passions in short that dispute the heart of an
outraged woman in love, urged her to make a revelation; but she
reflected that she would be totally lost if she confessed having
assisted in such a machination, and above all, that dâ€™artagnan would
also be lost to her forever. this last thought of love counseled her to
make this last sacrifice.

dâ€™artagnan, on his part, had gained the summit of all his wishes. it was
no longer a rival wh

vous hand, he drew it almost
unconsciously from the scabbard. but without taking any heed of the
sword, milady endeavored to get near enough to him to stab him, and did
not stop till she felt the sharp point at her throat.

she then tried to seize the sword with her hands; but dâ€™artagnan kept it
free from her grasp, and presenting the point, sometimes at her eyes,
sometimes at her breast, compelled her to glide behind the bedstead,
while he aimed at making his retreat by the door which led to kittyâ€™s
apartment.

milady during this time continued to strike at him with horrible fury,
screaming in a formidable way.

as all this, however, bore some resemblance to a duel, dâ€™artagnan began
to recover himself little by little.

"well, beautiful lady, very well," said he; "but, pardieu, if you donâ€™t
calm yourself, i will design a second fleur-de-lis upon one of those
pretty cheeks!"

"scoundrel, infamous scoundrel!" howled milady.

but dâ€™artagnan, still keeping on the defensive, drew near

 to kittyâ€™s
door. at the noise they made, she in overturning the furniture in her
efforts to get at him, he in screening himself behind the furniture to
keep out of her reach, kitty opened the door. dâ€™artagnan, who had
unceasingly maneuvered to gain this point, was not at more than three
paces from it. with one spring he flew from the chamber of milady into
that of the maid, and quick as lightning, he slammed to the door, and
placed all his weight against it, while kitty pushed the bolts.

then milady attempted to tear down the doorcase, with a strength
apparently above that of a woman; but finding she could not accomplish
this, she in her fury stabbed at the door with her poniard, the point of
which repeatedly glittered through the wood. every blow was accompanied
with terrible imprecations.

"quick, kitty, quick!" said dâ€™artagnan, in a low voice, as soon as the
bolts were fast, "let me get out of the hotel; for if we leave her time
to turn round, she will h

ave me killed by the servants."

"but you canâ€™t go out so," said kitty; "you are naked."

"thatâ€™s true," said dâ€™artagnan, then first thinking of the costume he
found himself in, "thatâ€™s true. but dress me as well as you are able,
only make haste; think, my dear girl, itâ€™s life and death!"

kitty was but too well aware of that. in a turn of the hand she muffled
him up in a flowered robe, a large hood, and a cloak. she gave him some
slippers, in which he placed his naked feet, and then conducted him down
the stairs. it was time. milady had already rung her bell, and roused
the whole hotel. the porter was drawing the cord at the moment milady
cried from her window, "donâ€™t open!"

the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent
gesture. the moment she lost sight o

her chamber.




38 how, without incommding himself, athos procures his equipment


dâ€™artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of
what might become of kitty he ran at full speed across half paris, and
did not stop till he came to athosâ€™s door. the confusion of his mind,
the terror which spurred him on, the cries of some of the patrol who
started in pursuit of him, and the hooting of the people who,
notwithstanding the early hour, were going to their work, only made him
precipitate his course.

he crossed the court, ran up the two flights to athosâ€™s apartment, and
knocked at the door enough to break it down.

grimaud came, rubbing his half-open 
 
 ___________________________
 
ed himself, and athos did the same. when the two were
ready to go out, the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim,
and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon, and prepared to
follow his master.

they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs. bonacieux was
standing at the door, and looked at dâ€™artagnan hatefully.

"make haste, dear lodger," said he; "there is a very pretty girl waiting
for you upstairs; and you know women donâ€™t like to be kept waiting."

"thatâ€™s kitty!" said dâ€™artagnan to himself, and darted into the passage.

sure enough! upon the landing leading to the chamber, and crouching
against the door, he found the poor girl, all in a tremble. as soon as
she perceived him, she cried, "you have promised your protection; you
have promised to save me from her anger. remember, it is you who have
ruined me!"

"yes, yes, to be sure, kitty," said dâ€™artagnan; "be at ease, my girl.
but what happened after my departure?"

"how can i tell!" said kitty. "th

h some lady of your
acquaintance--in your own country, for instance."

"my dear little love! in my country the ladies do without chambermaids.
but stop! i can manage your business for you. planchet, go and find
aramis. request him to come here directly. we have something very
important to say to him."

"i understand," said athos; "but why not porthos? i should have thought
that his duchess--"

"oh, porthosâ€™s duchess is dressed by her husbandâ€™s clerks," said
dâ€™artagnan, laughing. "besides, kitty would not like to live in the rue
aux ours. isnâ€™t it so, kitty?"

"i do not care where i live," said kitty, "provided i am well concealed,
and nobody knows where i am."

"meanwhile, kitty, when we are about to separate, and you are no longer
jealous of me--"

"monsieur chevalier, far off or near," said kitty, "i shall always love
you."

"where the devil will constancy niche itself next?" murmured athos.

"and i, also," said dâ€™artagnan, "i also. i shall always love you; be
sure of that. but

about to put to you. did you never hear talk of a young
woman who was carried off one night?"

"there, now! oh, monsieur chevalier, do you love that woman still?"

"no, no; it is one of my friends who loves her--monsieur athos, this
gentleman here."

"i?" cried athos, with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is
about to tread upon an adder.

"you, to be sure!" said dâ€™artagnan, pressing athosâ€™s hand. "you know the
interest we both take in this poor little madame bonacieux. besides,
kitty will tell nothing; will you, kitty? you understand, my dear girl,"
continued dâ€™artagnan, "she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw
at the door as you came in."

"oh, my god! you remind me of my fright! if he should have known me
again!"

"how? know you again? did you ever see that man before?"

"he came twice to miladyâ€™s."

"thatâ€™s it. about what time?"

"why, about fifteen or eighteen days ago."

"exactly so."

"and yesterday evening he came again."

"yesterday evening?"

"yes, j

ust before you came."

"my dear athos, we are enveloped in a network of spies. and do you
believe he knew you again, kitty?"

"i pulled down my hood as soon as i saw him, but perhaps it was too
late."

"go down, athos--he mistrusts you less than me--and see if he be still
at his door."

athos went down and returned immediately.

"he has gone," said he, "and the house door is shut."

"he has gone to make his report, and to say that all the pigeons are at
this moment in the dovecot."

"well, then, let us all fly," said athos, "and leave nobody here but
planchet to bring us news."

"a minute. aramis, whom we have sent
 
 ___________________________
 
 for!"

"thatâ€™s true," said athos; "we must wait for aramis."

at that moment aramis entered.

the matter was all explained to him, and the friends gave him to
understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for
kitty.

aramis reflected for a minute, and then said, coloring, "will it be
really rendering you a service, dâ€™artagnan?"

"i shall be grateful to you all my life."

"very well. madame de bois-tracy asked me, for one of her friends who
resides in the provinces, i believe, for a trustworthy maid. if you can,
my dear dâ€™artagnan, answer for mademoiselle-"

"oh, monsieur, be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person
who will give me the means of quitting paris."

"then," said aramis, "thi

s falls out very well."

he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed
with a ring, and gave the billet to kitty.

"and now, my dear girl," said dâ€™artagnan, "you know that it is not good
for any of us to be here. therefore let us separate. we shall meet again
in better days."

"and whenever we find each other, in whatever place it may be," said
kitty, "you will find me loving you as i love you today."

"dicersâ€™ oaths!" said athos, while dâ€™artagnan went to conduct kitty
downstairs.

an instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet
again at four oâ€™clock with athos, and leaving planchet to guard the
house.

aramis returned home, and athos and dâ€™artagnan busied themselves about
pledging the sapphire.

as the gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles
on the ring. still further, the jew told them that if they would sell it
to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he would
give five hundred pistoles

nardâ€™s chamber; they were
heartrending.

as long as the procuratorâ€™s wife could follow him with her eyes, she
waved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out of the window as to
lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself. porthos
received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such
demonstrations, only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his
hat gracefully, and waved it to her as a sign of adieu.

on his part aramis wrote a long letter. to whom? nobody knew. kitty, who
was to set out that evening for tours, was waiting in the next chamber.

athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine.

in the meantime dâ€™artagnan was defiling with his company. arriving at
the faubourg st. antoine, he turned round to look gaily at the bastille;
but as it was the bastille alone he looked at, he did not observe
milady, who, mounted upon a light chestnut horse, designated him with
her finger to two ill-looking men who came close up to the ranks to take
notice of him. t

lative?" demanded milady, with a tone of
the most touching ingenuousness.

"and my only heir, are you not?" said lord de winter in his turn, fixing
his eyes on those of milady.

whatever command she had over herself, milady could not help starting;
and as in pronouncing the last words lord de winter placed his hand upon
the arm of his sister, this start did not escape him.

in fact, the blow was direct and severe. the first idea that occurred to
miladyâ€™s mind was that she had been betrayed by kitty, and that she had
recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she
had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant. she
also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon
dâ€™artagnan when he spared the life of her brother.

"i do not understand, my lord," said she, in order to gain time and make
her adversary speak out. "what do you mean to say? is there any secret
meaning concealed beneath your words?"

"oh, my god, no!" said lord de win

od who hears us, that on the contrary i am a fervent catholic!"

"then, madame," said the abbess, smiling, "be reassured; the house in
which you are shall not be a very hard prison, and we will do all in our
power to make you cherish your captivity. you will find here, moreover,
the young woman of whom i spoke, who is persecuted, no doubt, in
consequence of some court intrigue. she is amiable and well-behaved."

"what is her name?"

"she was sent to me by someone of high rank, under the name of kitty. i
have not tried to discover her other name."

"kitty!" cried milady. "what? are you sure?"

"that she is called so? yes, madame. do you know her?"

milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this
might be her old chambermaid. there was connected with the remembrance
of this girl a remembrance of anger; and a desire of vengeance
disordered the features of milady, which, however, immediately recovered
the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred face

 willingly have gone without sleep, sustained
as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her
heart, ever thirsting for intrigues, she nevertheless accepted the offer
of the superior. during the last fifteen days she had experienced so
many and such various emotions that if her frame of iron was still
capable of supporting fatigue, her mind required repose.

she therefore took leave of the abbess, and went to bed, softly rocked
by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought
to her thoughts. she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the
cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise. she had
succeeded; dâ€™artagnan was then in her power!

one thing alone frightened her; that was the remembrance of her husband,
the comte de la fere, whom she had believed dead, or at least
expatriated, and whom she found again in athos-the best friend of
dâ€™artagnan.

but alas, if he was the friend of dâ€™artagnan, he must have lent him his
