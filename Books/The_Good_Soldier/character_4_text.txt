t. edward
ashburnham was like that, and i thought it was only the duty of his rank
and station. perhaps that was all that it was--but i pray god to make
me discharge mine as well. and, but for the poor girl, i daresay that i
should never have seen it, however much the feeling might have been over
me. she had for him such enthusiasm that, although even now i do not
understand the technicalities of english life, i can gather enough. she
was with them during the whole of our last stay at nauheim.

nancy rufford was her name; she was leonora's only friend's only child,
and leonora was her guardian, if that is the correct term. she had lived
with the ashburnhams ever since she had been of the age of thirteen,
when her mother was said to have committed suicide owing to the
brutalities of her father. yes, it is a cheerful story.... edward always
called her "the girl", and it was very pretty, the evident affection
he had for her and she for him. and leonora's feet she would have
kissed--those two were for

possible that, if that feeling had not possessed me, i should have run
up sooner to her room and might have prevented her drinking the prussic
acid. but i just couldn't do it; it would have been like chasing a scrap
of paper--an occupation ignoble for a grown man.

and, as it began, so that matter has remained. i didn't care whether
she had come out of that bedroom or whether she hadn't. it simply didn't
interest me. florence didn't matter.

i suppose you will retort that i was in love with nancy rufford and that
my indifference was therefore discreditable. well, i am not seeking to
avoid discredit. i was in love with nancy rufford as i am in love with
the poor child's memory, quietly and quite tenderly in my american sort
of way. i had never thought about it until i heard leonora state that i
might now marry her. but, from that moment until her worse than death, i
do not suppose that i much thought about anything else. i don't mean to
say that i sighed about her or groaned; i just wanted to ma

o so, that is the end of him. but,
as soon as i came out of my catalepsy, i seemed to perceive that my
problem--that what i had to do to prepare myself for getting into
contact with her, was just to get back into contact with life. i had
been kept for twelve years in a rarefied atmosphere; what i then had
to do was a little fighting with real life, some wrestling with men
of business, some travelling amongst larger cities, something harsh,
something masculine. i didn't want to present myself to nancy rufford as
a sort of an old maid. that was why, just a fortnight after florence's
suicide, i set off for the united states.

ii

immediately after florence's death leonora began to put the leash upon
nancy rufford and edward. she had guessed what had happened under the
trees near the casino. they stayed at nauheim some weeks after i went,
and leonora has told me that that was the most deadly time of her
existence. it seemed like a long, silent duel with invisible weapons,
so she said. and it was render

enraged when, after the invention was mature, he made a present to the
war office of the designs and the patent rights. it was a remarkably
good stirrup.

i have told you, i think, that edward spent a great deal of time,
and about two hundred pounds for law fees on getting a poor girl, the
daughter of one of his gardeners, acquitted of a charge of murdering her
baby. that was positively the last act of edward's life. it came at a
time when nancy rufford was on her way to india; when the most horrible
gloom was over the household; when edward himself was in an agony and
behaving as prettily as he knew how. yet even then leonora made him a
terrible scene about this expenditure of time and trouble. she sort of
had the vague idea that what had passed with the girl and the rest of
it ought to have taught edward a lesson--the lesson of economy. she
threatened to take his banking account away from him again. i guess that
made him cut his throat. he m

red that it was defective. moreover, florence had certainly died
of her heart, as i saw it. and when miss florence hurlbird stood out
that the money ought to go to chest sufferers i was brought to thinking
that there ought to be a chest institution too, and i advanced the sum
that i was ready to provide to a million and a half of dollars. that
would have given seven hundred and fifty thousand to each class of
invalid. i did not want money at all badly. all i wanted it for was to
be able to give nancy rufford a good time. i did not know much about
housekeeping expenses in england where, i presumed, she would wish
to live. i knew that her needs at that time were limited to good
chocolates, and a good horse or two, and simple, pretty frocks. probably
she would want more than that later on. but even if i gave a million and
a half dollars to these institutions i should still have the equivalent
of about twenty thousand a year english, and i considered that nancy
could have a pretty good time on that or

ncy will be going to india, tomorrow, to be with her father."

no one spoke. nancy looked at her plate; edward went on eating his
pheasant. i felt very bad; i imagined that it would be up to me to
propose to nancy that evening. it appeared to me to be queer that they
had not given me any warning of nancy's departure--but i thought that
that was only english manners--some sort of delicacy that i had not got
the hang of. you must remember that at that moment i trusted in edward
and leonora and in nancy rufford, and in the tranquility of ancient
haunts of peace, as i had trusted in my mother's love. and that evening
edward spoke to me.

what in the interval had happened had been this:

upon her return from nauheim leonora had completely broken down--because
she knew she could trust edward. that seems odd but, if you know
anything about breakdowns, you will know that by the ingenious torments
that fate prepares for us, these things come as soon as, a strain having
relaxed, there is nothing more to be d

and many bad places of the day. and that would account for the girl's
passionate love for the elder woman. for nancy's love for leonora was an
admiration that is awakened in catholics by their feeling for the virgin
mary and for various of the saints. it is too little to say that the
girl would have laid her life at leonora's feet. well, she laid
there the offer of her virtue--and her reason. those were sufficient
instalments of her life. it would today be much better for nancy rufford
if she were dead.

perhaps all these reflections are a nuisance; but they crowd on me. i
will try to tell the story.

you see--when she came back from nauheim leonora began to have her
headaches--headaches lasting through whole days, during which she could
speak no word and could bear to hear no sound. and, day after day,
nancy would sit with her, silent and motionless for hours, steeping
handkerchiefs in vinegar and water, and thinking her own thoughts. it
must have been very bad for her--and

 nancy ought to do more for her father. he is
getting an old man. i have written to colonel rufford, suggesting that
she should go to him."

leonora called out:

"how dare you? how dare you?"

the girl put her hand over her heart and cried out: "oh, my sweet
saviour, help me!" that was the queer way she thought within her mind,
and the words forced themselves to her lips. edward said nothing.

and that night, by a merciless trick of the devil that pays attention
to this sweltering hell of ours, nancy rufford had a letter from her
mother. it came whilst leonora was talking to edward, or leonora would
have intercepted it as she had intercepted others. it was an amazing and
a horrible letter.. ..

i don't know what it contained. i just average out from its effects on
nancy that her mother, having eloped with some worthless sort of fellow,
had done what is called "sinking lower and lower". whether she was
actually on the streets i do not know, but i rather think that she eked
out a small allowance that

daughter or the most careful dean of a cathedral would
object to. i have only followed, faintly, and in my unconscious desires,
edward ashburnham. well, it is all over. not one of us has got what he
really wanted. leonora wanted edward, and she has got rodney bayham, a
pleasant enough sort of sheep. florence wanted branshaw, and it is i
who have bought it from leonora. i didn't really want it; what i
wanted mostly was to cease being a nurse-attendant. well, i am a
nurse-attendant. edward wanted nancy rufford, and i have got her. only
she is mad. it is a queer and fantastic world. why can't people have
what they want? the things were all there to content everybody; yet
everybody has the wrong thing. perhaps you can make head or tail of it;
it is beyond me.

is there any terrestial paradise where, amidst the whispering of the
olive-leaves, people can be with whom they like and have what they like
and take their ease in shadows and in coolness? or are all men's lives

ells, of the ruffords--broken, tumultuous, agonized, and
unromantic, lives, periods punctuated by screams, by imbecilities, by
deaths, by agonies? who the devil knows?

for there was a great deal of imbecility about the closing scenes of the
ashburnham tragedy. neither of those two women knew what they wanted. it
was only edward who took a perfectly clear line, and he was drunk most
of the time. but, drunk or sober, he stuck to what was demanded by
convention and by the traditions of his house. nancy rufford had to be
exported to india, and nancy rufford hadn't to hear a word of love from
him. she was exported to india and she never heard a word from edward
ashburnham.

it was the conventional line; it was in tune with the tradition of
edward's house. i daresay it worked out for the greatest good of the
body politic. conventions and traditions, i suppose, work blindly but
surely for the preservation of the normal type; for the extinction of
proud, resolute and unusual individuals.

the other woman has given her husband a bad time. i am certain that
if she thinks the man has been a brute to his wife she will, with her
instinctive feeling for suffering femininity, "put him back", as
the saying is. i don't attach any particular importance to these
generalizations of mine. they may be right, they may be wrong; i am only
an ageing american with very little knowledge of life. you may take my
generalizations or leave them. but i am pretty certain that i am right
in the case of nancy rufford--that she had loved edward ashburnham very
deeply and tenderly.

it is nothing to the point that she let him have it good and strong as
soon as she discovered that he had been unfaithful to leonora and that
his public services had cost more than leonora thought they ought to
have cost. nancy would be bound to let him have it good and strong then.
she would owe that to feminine public opinion; she would be driven to it
by the instinct for self-preservation, since she might well imagine
that if e

dward had been unfaithful to leonora, to mrs basil and to the
memories of the other two, he might be unfaithful to herself. and,
no doubt, she had her share of the sex instinct that makes women be
intolerably cruel to the beloved person. anyhow, i don't know whether,
at this point, nancy rufford loved edward ashburnham. i don't know
whether she even loved him when, on getting, at aden, the news of his
suicide she went mad. because that may just as well have been for the
sake of leonora as for the sake of edward. or it may have been for the
sake of both of them. i don't know. i know nothing. i am very tired.
leonora held passionately the doctrine that the girl didn't love edward.
she wanted desperately to believe that. it was a doctrine as necessary
to her existence as a belief in the p

were the quietest moments that i have ever known. then, suddenly, edward
looked me straight in the eyes and said:

"look here, old man, i wish you would drive with nancy and me to the
station tomorrow."

i said that of course i would drive with him and nancy to the station on
the morrow. he lay there for a long time, looking along the line of his
knees at the fluttering fire, and then suddenly, in a perfectly calm
voice, and without lifting his eyes, he said:

"i am so desperately in love with nancy rufford that i am dying of it."

poor devil--he hadn't meant to speak of it. but i guess he just had to
speak to somebody and i appeared to be like a woman or a solicitor. he
talked all night.

well, he carried out the programme to the last breath.

it was a very clear winter morning, with a good deal of frost in it.
the sun was quite bright, the winding road between the heather and the
bracken was very hard. i sat on the back-seat of the dog-cart; nancy was
beside edward. they talked about the way the
