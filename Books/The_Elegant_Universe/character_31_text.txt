during the last thirty years of his life, albert einstein sought relentlessly for a so-called unified field
theory—a  theory  capable  of  describing  nature's  forces  within  a  single,  all-encompassing,  coherent
framework. einstein was not motivated by the things we often a

simultaneously be brought to bear. for reasons that will become increasingly clear as we proceed,
the equations of general relativity and quantum mechanics, when combined, begin to shake, rattle, and
gush  with  steam  like  a  red-lined  automobile.  put  less  figuratively,  well-posed  physical  questions
elicit nonsensical answers from the unhappy amalgam of these two theories. even if you are willing
to keep the deep interior of a black hole and the beginning of the universe shrouded in mystery, you
can't help feeling that the hostility between quantum mechanics and general relativity cries out for a
deeper  level  of  understanding.  can  it  really  be  that  the  universe  at  its  most  fundamental  level  is
divided, requiring one set of laws when things are large and a different, incompatible set when things
are small?

he hovered just above the surface of a neutron star whose mass, roughly equal to that of the sun, is
crushed  to  a  density  some  million  billion  times  that  of  solar  density,  the  larger  gravitational  field
would cause his clock to tick at about 76 percent of the rate of gracie's. stronger gravitational fields,
such as those just outside a black hole (as discussed below), cause the flow of time to slow even
further; stronger gravitational fields cause a more severe warping of time.

experimental verification of general relativity

most people who study general relativity are captivated by its aesthetic elegance. by replacing the
cold,  mechanistic  newtonian  view  of  space,  time,  and  gravity  with  a  dynamic  and  geometric
description involving curved spacetime, einstein wove gravity into the basic fabric of the universe.

nevertheless, in the last 40 years a variety of experiments making use of technological advancements
have tested numerous aspects of general relativity with great precision. the predictions of general
relativity have been uniformly confirmed. there is no longer any doubt that einstein's description of
gravity is not only compatible with special relativity, but yields predictions closer to experimental
results than those of newton's theory.

black holes, the big bang, and the expansion of space

whereas special relativity is most manifest when things are moving fast, general relativity comes into
its own when things are very massive and the warps in space and time are correspondingly severe.
let's describe two examples.

the  first  is  a  discovery  made  by  the  german  astronomer  karl  schwarzschild  while  studying
einstein's  revelations  on  gravity  in  between  his  own  calculations  of  artillery  trajectories  at  the

 too close to the star will be unable to escape its gravitational grip. since not
even  light  can  escape  such  "compressed  stars,"  they  were  initially  called dark  or frozen  stars. a
more  catchy  name  was  coined  years  later  by  john  wheeler,  who  called  them black  holes—black
because  they  cannot  emit  light,  holes  because  anything  getting  too  close  falls  into  them,  never  to
return. the name stuck.

we illustrate schwarzschild's solution in figure 3.7. although black holes have a reputation for
rapacity, objects that pass by them at a "safe" distance are deflected in much the same way that they
would be by an ordinary star, and can proceed on their merry way. but objects of any composition
whatsoever that get too close—closer than what has been termed the black hole's event horizon—are
doomed: they will be drawn inexorably toward the center of the black hole and subject to an ever
increasing  and  ultimately  destructive  gravitational  strain.  for  example

,  if  you  dropped  feet  first
through the event horizon, as you approached the black hole's center you would find yourself getting
increasingly uncomfortable. the gravitational force of the black hole would increase so dramatically

that its pull on your feet would be much stronger than its pull on your head (since in a feet-first fall
your feet are always a bit closer than your head to the black hole's center); so much stronger, in fact,
that you would be stretched with a force that would quickly tear your body to shreds.

figure 3.7 a black hole warps the surrounding spacetime fabric so severely that anything that comes
within its "event horizon"—illustrated by the dark circle—can't escape from its gravitational grip. no
one knows exactly what happens at the deepest interior point of a black hole.

if, on the contrary, you were more prudent in your wanderings near a black hole and took

care  not  to  trespass  beyond  the  event  horizon,  you  could  make  use  of  the  black  hole  for  a  rather
amazing feat. imagine, for example, that you were to discover a black hole whose mass was about
1,000 times the mass of the sun, and that you were to lower yourself on a cable, much as george did
near  the  sun,  to  about  an  inch  above  the  black  hole's  event  horizon.  as  we  have  discussed,
gravitational fields cause a warping of time, and this means that your passage through time would
slow down. in fact, since black holes have such strong gravitational fields, your passage through time
would  slow way down. your watch would tick about ten thousand times m

manner  for  a  year,  and  then  climb  up  the  cable  to  your  waiting  starship  for  a  short,  yet  leisurely,
journey home, upon arrival at earth you would find that more than ten thousand years had passed since
your initial departure. you would have successfully used the black hole as a kind of time machine,
allowing you to travel to earth's distant future.

to get a sense of the extreme scales involved, a star with the mass of the sun would be a black
hole if its radius were not its actual value (about 450,000 miles), but, instead, just under 2 miles.
imagine: the whole of the sun squeezed to fit comfortably within upper manhattan. a teaspoonful of
such a compressed sun would weigh about as much as mount everest. to make a black hole out of the

physicists  were  skeptical  about  whether  such  extreme  configurations  of  matter  could  ever  actually
occur, and many thought that black holes were merely a reflection of an overworked theoretician's
imagination.

nevertheless, during the last decade, an increasingly convincing body of experimental evidence
for  the  existence  of  black  holes  has  accumulated.  of  course,  since  they  are  black,  they  cannot  be
observed directly by scanning the sky with telescopes. instead, astronomers search for black holes by
seeking anomalous behavior of other more ordinary light-emitting stars that may be positioned just

ordinary stars fall toward the event horizon of a black hole, they are accelerated to nearly the speed
of light. at such speeds, friction within the maelstrom of downward-swirling material generates an
enormous  amount  of  heat,  causing  the  dust-gas  mixture  to  "glow,"  giving  off  both  ordinary  visible
light and x rays. since this radiation is produced just outside the event horizon, it can escape the
black  hole  and  travel  through  space  to  be  observed  and  studied  directly.  general  relativity  makes

perties  that  such  x  ray  emissions  will  have;  observation  of  these
predicted  properties  gives  strong,  albeit  indirect,  evidence  for  the  existence  of  black  holes.  for
example, mounting evidence indicates that there is a very massive black hole, some two and a half
million times as massive as the sun, sitting in the center of our own milky way galaxy. and even this
seemingly gargantuan black hole pales in comparison to what astronomers believe to reside in the
core  of  the  astonishingly  luminous  quasars  that  are  scattered  throughout  the  cosmos:  black  holes
whose masses may well be billions of times that of the sun.

understanding  what  really  happens  to  space,  time,  and  matter  when  crushed  together  fully  at  the
moment of the big bang or at the central point of a black hole. but more generally, the conflict alerts
us to a fundamental deficiency in our conception of nature. the resolution of this conflict has eluded
attempts  by  some  of  the  greatest  theoretical  physicists,  giving  it  a  well-deserved  reputation  as the
central problem of modern theoretical physics. understanding the conflict requires familiarity with
some basic features of quantum theory, to which we now turn.

an appraisal

the history of physics is filled with ideas that when first presented seemed completely untestable but,
through various unforeseen developments, were ultimately brought within the realm of experimental
verifiability. the notion that matter is made of atoms, pauli's hypothesis that there are ghostly neutrino
particles, and the possibility that the heavens are dotted with neutron stars and black holes are three
prominent ideas of precisely this sort—ideas that we now embrace fully but that, at their inception,
seemed more like musings of science fiction than aspects of science fact.

the motivation for introducing string theory is at least as compelling as any of these three ideas
—in fact, string theory has been hailed as the most important and exciting development in theoretical
physics since the discovery of quantum mechanics. this comparison is particularly apt because the

of the universe to the other.

do wormholes exist in the universe? no one knows. and if they do, it is far from clear whether
they would take on only a microscopic form or if they could span vast regions of the universe (as in
deep  space  nine).  but  one  essential  element  in  assessing  whether  they  are  fact  or  fiction  is
determining whether or not the fabric of space can tear.

black holes provide another compelling example in which the fabric of space is stretched to its
limits.  in  figure  3.7,  we  saw  that  the  enormous  gravitational  field  of  a  black  hole  results  in  such
extreme  curvature  that  the  fabric  of  space appears  to  be  pinched  or  punctured  at  the  black  hole's
center.  unlike  in  the  case  of  wormholes,  there  is  strong  experimental  evidence  supporting  the
existence  of  black  holes,  so  the  question  of  what  really  happens  a

with  the  discovery  of  string  theory  and  the  harmonious  merger  of  quantum  mechanics  and
gravity,  we  are  finally  poised  to  study  these  issues. as  yet,  string  theorists  have  not  been  able  to
answer  them  fully,  but  during  the  last  few  years  closely  related  issues have  been  solved.  in  this
chapter  we  discuss  how  string  theory,  for  the  first  time,  definitively  shows  that  there  are  physical

circumstances—differing from wormholes and black holes in certain ways—in which the fabric of
space can tear.

a tantalizing possibility

in  1987,  shing-tung  yau  and  his  student  gang  tian,  now  at  the  massachusetts  institute  of
technology,  made  an  interesting  mathematical  observation.  they  found,  using  a  well-known
mathematical  procedure,  that  certain  calabi-yau  shapes  could  be  transformed  into  others  by
puncturing their surface and then sewing up the resulting hole according to a precise mathematical
pattern.2

of these techniques to find the remarkable insights
alluded to above. but don't worry. the really hard work has already been done by string theorists and
we will content ourselves here with explaining their results.

nevertheless, as there are many seemingly separate pieces that we must develop and assemble,
in this chapter it is especially easy to lose the forest for the trees. and so, if at any time in this chapter
the discussion gets a little too involved and you feel compelled to rush on to black holes (chapter 13)
or cosmology (chapter 14), take a quick glance back at the following section, which summarizes the
key insights of the second superstring revolution.

a summary of the second superstring revolution

the primary insight of the second superstring revolution is summarized by figures 12.1 and 12.2. in

scientific upheavals of the past."15 this is the program for unification in the twenty-first century.

black holes: a string/m-theory perspective

the pre–string theory conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics was an affront to
our visceral sense that the laws of nature should fit together in a seamless, coherent whole. but this
antagonism  was  more  than  a  towering  abstract  disjunction.  the  extreme  physical  conditions  that
occurred  at  the  moment  of  the  big  bang  and  that  prevail  within  black  holes cannot  be  understood
without  a  quantum  mechanical  formulation

 of  the  gravitational  force.  with  the  discovery  of  string
theory, we now have a hope of solving these deep mysteries. in this and the next chapter, we describe
how far string theorists have gone toward understanding black holes and the origin of the universe.

black holes and elementary particles

at  first  sight  it's  hard  to  imagine  any  two  things  more  radically  different  than  black  holes  and
elementary  particles.  we  usually  picture  black  holes  as  the  most  gargantuan  of  heavenly  bodies,
whereas elementary particles are the most minute specks of matter. but the research of a number of
physicists during the late 1960s and early 1970s, including demetrios christodoulou, werner israel,
richard  price,  brandon  carter,  roy  kerr,  davi
 
 ___________________________
 
d  robinson,  hawking,  and  penrose,  showed  that
black holes and elementary particles are perhaps not as different as one might think. these physicists
found  increasingly  persuasive  evidence  for  what  john  wheeler  has  summarized  by  the  statement
"black holes have no hair." by this, wheeler meant that except for a small number of distinguishing
features, all black holes appear to be alike. the distinguishing features? one, of course, is the black
hole's mass. what are the others? research has revealed that they are the electric and certain other
force charges a black hole can carry, as well as the rate at which it spins. and that's it. any two black
holes with the same mass, force charges, and spin are completely identical. black holes do not have
fancy "hairdos"—that is, other intrinsic traits—that distinguish one from another. this should ring a
loud be
 
 ___________________________
 
ll. recall that it is precisely such properties—mass, force charges, and spin—that distinguish
one  elementary  particle  from  another.  the  similarity  of  the  defining  traits  has  led  a  number  of
physicists  over  the  years  to  the  strange  speculation  that  black  holes  might  actually  be  gigantic
elementary particles.

in fact, according to einstein's theory, there is no minimum mass for a black hole. if we crush a
chunk of matter of any mass to a small enough size, a straightforward application of general relativity
shows that it will become a black hole. (the lighter the mass, the smaller we must crush it.) and so,
we can imagine a thought experiment in which we start with ever-lighter blobs of matter, crush them
into  ever-smaller  black  holes,  and  compare  the  properties  of  the  resulting  black  holes  with  the
properties of elementary particles. wheeler's no-hair statement lead
 
 ___________________________
 
s us to conclude that for small
enough masses the black holes we form in this manner will look very much like elementary particles.
both will look like tiny bundles characterized completely by their mass, force charges, and spin.

but there is a catch. astrophysical black holes, with masses many times that of the sun, are so
large  and  heavy  that  quantum  mechanics  is  largely  irrelevant  and  only  the  equations  of  general
relativity need be used to understand their properties. (we are here discussing the overall structure of
the black hole, not the singular central point of collapse within a black hole, whose tiny size most
certainly  requires  a  quantum-mechanical  description.) as  we  try  to  make  ever  less  massive  black
holes, however, there comes
 
 ___________________________
 
 a point when they are so light and small that quantum mechanics does
comes into play. this happens if the total mass of the black hole is about the planck mass or less.
(from the point of view of elementary particle physics, the planck mass is huge—some ten billion
billion times the mass of a proton. from the point of view of black holes, though, the planck mass,
being equal to that of an average grain of dust, is quite tiny.) and so, physicists who speculated that
tiny  black  holes  and  elementary  particles  might  be  closely  related  immediately  ran  up  against  the
incompatibility  between  general  relativity—the  theoretical  heart  of  black  holes—and  quantum
mechanics. in the past, the incompatibility stymied all progress in this intriguing direction.

does string theory allow us to go forward?

it  does.

through  a  fairly  unexpected  and  sophisticated  realization  of  black  holes,  string  theory
provides the first theoretically sound connection between black holes and elementary particles. the
road  to  this  connection  is  a  bit  circuitous,  but  it  takes  us  through  some  of  the  most  interesting
developments in string theory, making it a journey well worth taking.

it begins with a seemingly unrelated question that string theorists have kicked around since the
late  1980s.  mathematicians  and  physicists  have  long  known  that  when  six  spatial  dimensions  are
curled up into a calabi-yau shape, there are generally two kinds of spheres t

among the many e-mail responses was one from plesser, who gave us one of the highest compliments
one physicist can give another by declaring, "i wish that i had thought of that!" notwithstanding our
fears the previous night, we had convinced the string theory community that not only can the fabric of
space undergo the mild tears discovered earlier (chapter 11), but that far more drastic rips, roughly
illustrated by figure 13.3, can occur as well.

returning to black holes and elementary particles

what does this have to do with black holes and elementary particles? a lot. to see this, we must ask
ourselves the same question we posed in chapter 11. what are the observable physical consequences
of such tears in the fabric of space? for flop transitions, as we have seen, the surprising answer to
this question was that not much happens at all. for conifold transitions—the technical name for the
drastic space-tearing transitions we had now found—there is, once

 can collapse without an ensuing disaster, because a three-brane
wrapped  around  it  provides  a  perfect  protective  shield.  but  what  does  such  a  wrapped-brane
configuration look like? the answer comes from earlier work of horowitz and strominger, which
showed that to persons such as ourselves who are directly cognizant only of the three extended spatial
dimensions, the three-brane "smeared" around the three-dimensional sphere will set up a gravitational
field that looks like that of a black hole.2 this is not obvious and becomes clear only from a detailed
study  of  the  equations  governing  the  branes.  again,  it's  hard  to  draw  such  higher-dimensional
configurations accurately on a page, but figure 13.4 conveys the rough idea with a lower-dimensional
analogy  involving  two-dimensional  spheres.  we  see  that  a  two-dimensional  membrane  can  smear
itself around a two-dimensional sphere (which itself is sitting inside a calabi-yau space positioned
at  some  location  in  th

ne—the
mass  of  the  black  hole,  that  is—is  proportional  to  the  volume  of  the  three-dimensional  sphere  it
wraps:  the  bigger  the  volume  of  the  sphere,  the  bigger  the  three-brane  must  be  in  order  to  wrap
around  it,  and  the  more  massive  it  becomes.  similarly,  the  smaller  the  volume  of  the  sphere,  the
smaller the mass of the three-brane that wraps it. as this sphere collapses, then, a three-brane that
wraps around the sphere, which is perceived as a black hole, appears to become ever lighter. when
the three-dimensional sphere has collapsed to a pinched point, the corresponding black hole—brace
yourself—is massless. although it sounds completely mysterious—what in the world is a massless
black hole?—we will soon connect this enigma with more familiar string physics.

figure 13.4 when a brane wraps around a sphere that is within the curled-up dimensions, it appears
as a black hole in the familiar extended dimensions.

the second ingredient we

ou to believe that the number of holes—and thus the number of patterns—
decreases, but this proves to be a misleading property of the lower-dimensional analogy.)

to combine the observations of the preceding two paragraphs, imagine a sequence of snapshots
of a calabi-yau space in which the size of a particular three-dimensional sphere gets smaller and
smaller.  the  first  observation  implies  that  a  three-brane  wrapping  around  this  three-dimensional
sphere—which appears to us as a black hole—will have ever smaller mass until, at the final point of
collapse, it will be massless. but, as we asked above, what does this mean? the answer became
clear to us by invoking the second observation. our work showed that the new massless pattern of
string vibration arising from the space-tearing conifold transition is the microscopic description of a
massless particle into which the black hole has transmuted.  we  concluded  that  as  a  calabi-yau
shape goes through a space-tearing conifold t
 
 ___________________________
 
ransition, an initially massive black hole becomes ever
lighter until it is massless and then it transmutes into a massless particle—such as a massless photon
—which in string theory is nothing but a single string executing a particular vibrational pattern. in this
way,  for  the  first  time,  string  theory  explicitly  establishes  a  direct,  concrete,  and  quantitatively
unassailable connection between black holes and elementary particles.

"melting" black holes

the  connection  between  black  holes  and  elementary  particles  which  we  found  is  closely  akin  to
something we are all familiar with from day-to-day life, known technically as a phase transition. a
simple example of a phase transition is the one we mentioned in the last chapter: water can exist as a
solid (ice), as a liquid (liquid water), and a gas (steam). these are known as the phases of water, and
the transformation from one form to another is called a phase transition. morrison
 
 ___________________________
 
ticles  are  actually  two  phases  of  the  same
underlying  stringy  material.  whereas  the  surrounding  temperature  determines  the  phase  in  which
water will exist, the topological form—the shape—of the extra calabi-yau dimensions determines
whether  certain  physical  configurations  within  string  theory  appear  as  black  holes  or  elementary
particles. that is, in the first phase, the initial calabi-yau shape (the analog of the ice phase, say), we
find that there are certain black holes present. in the second phase, the second calabi-yau shape (the
analog of the liquid water phase), these black holes have gone through a phase transition—they have
"melted"  so  to  speak—into  fundamental  vibrational  string  patterns.  the  tearing  of  space  through

conifold transitions takes us from one calabi-yau phase to the other. in so doing, we see that black
holes and elementary particles, like water and ice, are two sides of the same coin. we see that black
holes snugly fit w
 
 ___________________________
 
inuously deform one calabi-yau shape into any other. but now we see that the answer is yes:
through these physically sensible space-tearing conifold transitions, we can continuously change any
given  calabi-yau  space  into  any  other.  by  varying  coupling  constants  and  curled-up  calabi-yau
geometry,  we  see  that  all  string  constructions  are,  once  again,  different  phases  of  a  single  theory.
even after curling up all extra dimensions, the unity of figure 12.11 firmly holds.

black hole entropy

for many years, some of the most accomplished theoretical physicists speculated about the possibility
of  space-tearing  processes  and  of  a  connection  between  black  holes  and  elementary  particles.
although such speculations might have sounded like science fiction at first, the discovery of string
theory, with its ability to merge general relativity and quantum mechanics, has allowed us now to
plant these possibilities firmly at the forefront of cutting-edge science. this succ

ess emboldens us to
ask  whether  any  of  the  other  mysterious  properties  of  our  universe  that  have  stubbornly  resisted
resolution for decades might also succumb to the powers of string theory. foremost among these is the
notion of black hole entropy. this is the arena in which string theory has most impressively flexed its
muscles, successfully solving a quarter-century-old problem of profound significance.

entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness. for instance, if your desk is cluttered high with
layer upon layer of open books, half-read articles, old newspapers, and junk mail, it is in a state of
high disorder, or high entropy. on the other hand, if it is fully organized with articles in alphabetized
folders, newspapers ne

elementary constituents of a
physical system that do not affect its gross macroscopic properties (such as its energy or pressure).
the  details  are  not  essential  so  long  as  you  realize  that  entropy  is  a  fully  quantitative  quantum-
mechanical concept that precisely measures the overall disorder of a physical system.

in  1970,  jacob  bekenstein,  then  a  graduate  student  of  john  wheeler's  at  princeton,  made  an
audacious suggestion. he put forward the remarkable idea that black holes might have entropy—and a
huge  amount  of  it.  bekenstein  was  motivated  by  the  venerable  and  well-tested second  law  of
thermodynamics,  which  declares  that  the  entropy  of  a  system  always  increases:  everything  tends
toward  greater  disorder.  even  if  you  clean  your  cluttered  desk,  decreasing  its  entropy,  the  total
entropy, including that of your body and the air in the room, actually increases. you see, to clean your
desk you have to expend energy; you have to
 
 ___________________________
 
 disrupt some of the orderly molecules of fat in your body
to create this energy for your muscles, and as you clean, your body gives off heat, which jostles the
surrounding air molecules into a higher state of agitation and disorder. when all of these effects are
accounted  for,  they  more  than  compensate  for  your  desk's  decrease  in  entropy,  and  thus  the  total
entropy increases.

but what happens, bekenstein in effect asked, if you clean your desk near the event horizon of a
black hole and you set up a vacuum pump to suck all of the newly agitated air molecules from the
room into the hidden depths of the black hole's interior? we can be even more extreme: what if the
vacuum pumps all the air, and all the contents on the desk, and even the desk itself into the black hole,
leaving you in a cold, airless, thoroughly ordered room? since the entropy in your room has certainly
decreased, bekenstein reasoned that the only way to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics would
be for 
 
 ___________________________
 
the black hole to have entropy, and for this entropy to sufficiently increase as matter is pumped
into it to offset the observed entropic decrease outside the black hole's exterior.

in fact, bekenstein was able to draw on a famous result of stephen hawking's to strengthen his
case. hawking had shown that the area of the event horizon of a black hole—recall, this is the surface
of no return that enshrouds every black hole—always increases in any physical interaction. hawking
demonstrated that if an asteroid falls into a black hole, or if some of the surface gas of a nearby star
accretes onto the black hole, or if two black holes collide and combine—in any of these processes
and  all  others  as  well,  the  total  area  of  the  event  horizon  of  a  black  hole  always  increases.  to

reater total entropy embodied in the second law of thermodynamics. he proposed that
the area of the event horizon of a black hole provides a precise measure of its entropy.

on closer inspection, though, there are two reasons why most physicists thought that bekenstein's
idea could not be right. first, black holes would seem to be among the most ordered and organized
objects in the whole universe. once one measures the black hole's mass, the force charges it carries,
and its spin, its identity has been nailed down precisely. with so few defining features, a black hole
appears to lack sufficient structure to allow for disorder. just as there is little havoc one can wreak
on a desktop that holds solely a book and a pencil, black holes seem too simple to support disorder.
the  second  reason  that  bekenstein's  proposal  was  hard  to  swallow  is  that  entropy,  as  we  have
discussed it here, is a quantum-mechanical co

ncept, whereas black holes, until recently, were firmly
entrenched in the antagonistic camp of classical general relativity. in the early 1970s, without a way
to  merge  general  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics,  it  seemed  awkward,  at  best,  to  discuss  the
possible entropy of a black hole.

how black is black?

as it turns out, hawking too had thought of the analogy between his black hole area-increase law and
the law of inevitable increase of entropy, but he dismissed it as nothing more than a coincidence.
after  all,  hawking  argued,  based  upon  his  area-increase  law  and  other  results  he  had  found  with
james bardeen and brandon carter, if one did take the analogy between the laws of black holes and
the laws of thermodynamics seriously, not only would one be forced to identify the area of the black
hole's event horizon with entropy, but it turns out that one would a

lso have to assign a temperature to
the black hole (with the precise value determined by the strength of the black hole's gravitational field
at its event horizon). but if a black hole has a nonzero temperature—no matter how small—the most
basic  and  well-established  physical  principles  would require  it  to  emit  radiation,  much  like  a
glowing poker. but black holes, as everyone knows, are black; they supposedly do not emit anything.
hawking  and  most  everyone  else  agreed  that  this  definitively  ruled  out  bekenstein's  suggestion.
instead, hawking was willing to accept that if matter carrying entropy is dropped into a black hole,
this entropy is lost, plain and simple. so much for the second law of thermodynamics.

this  was  the  case  until  hawking,  in  1974,  discovered  something  truly  amazing.  black  holes,
hawking announced, are not co

inally found some six decades previously, black
holes  certainly  do  not  allow  anything—not  even  light—to  escape  their  gravitational  grip.  but  the
inclusion of quantum mechanics modifies this conclusion in a profound way. even though he was not
in possession of a quantum-mechanical version of general relativity, hawking was able to finesse a
partial union of these two theoretical tools that yielded some limited yet reliable results. and the most
important result he found was that black holes do emit radiation, quantum mechanically.

the calculations are long and arduous, but hawking's basic idea is simple. we have seen that
the uncertainty principle ensures that even the vacuum of empty space is a teeming, roiling frenzy of
virtual particles momentarily erupting into existence and subsequently annihilating one another. this
jittery quantum behavior also occurs in the region of space just outside the event horizon of a black
hole. hawking realized, however, that the gravitational m

ight of the black hole can inject energy into
a pair of virtual photons, say, that tears them just far enough apart so that one gets sucked into the
hole. with its partner having disappeared into the abyss of the hole, the other photon of the pair no
longer has a partner with which to annihilate. instead, hawking showed that the remaining photon gets
an energy boost from the gravitational force of the black hole and, as its partner falls inward, it gets
shot outward, away from the black hole. hawking realized that to someone looking at the black hole
from the safety of afar, the combined effect of this tearing apart of virtual photon pairs, happening
over  and  over  again  all  around  the  horizon  of  the  black  hole,  will  appear  as  a  steady  stream  of
outgoing radiation. black holes glow.

moreover,  hawking  was  able  to  calculate  the  temperature  that  a  far-off  observer  would
associate with the emitted radiation and found that it is given by the strength of the

 gravitational field
at the black hole's horizon, exactly as the analogy between the laws of black hole physics and the
laws of thermodynamics suggested.3 bekenstein was right: hawking's results showed that the analogy
should be taken seriously. in fact, these results showed that it is much more than an analogy—it is an
identity. a black hole has entropy. a black hole has temperature. and the gravitational laws of black
hole  physics  are  nothing  but  a  rewriting  of  the  laws  of  thermodynamics  in  an  extremely  exotic
gravitational context. this was hawking's 1974 bombshell.

to give you a sense of the scales involved, it turns out that when one carefully accounts for all of

the details, a black hole whose mass is about three times that of the sun has a temperature of about a
hundred-millionth of a degree above absolute zero. it's not zero, but on

ly just. black holes are not
black,  but  only  barely.  unfortunately,  this  makes  a  black  hole's  emitted  radiation  meager,  and
impossible to detect experimentally. there is, however, an exception. hawking's calculations also
showed that the less massive a black hole is, the higher its temperature and the greater the radiation it
emits. for instance, a black hole as light as a small asteroid would emit about as much radiation as a
million-megaton  hydrogen  bomb,  with  radiation  concentrated  in  the  gamma-ray  part  of  the
electromagnetic spectrum. astronomers have searched the night sky for such radiation, but except for
a few long-shot possibilities they have come up empty-handed, a likely indication that such low-mass
black holes, if they exist, are very rare.4 as hawking often jokingly points out, this is too bad, for if

tion  that  his  work  predicts  were  to  be  detected,  he  would  undoubtedly  win  a
nobel prize.5

by contrast with its tiny, sub-millionth of a degree temperature, when one calculates the entropy
of, say, a three-solar-mass black hole, the result is an absolutely enormous number: a one followed by
about 78 zeros! and the more massive the hole, the greater the entropy. the success of hawking's
calculations  unequivocally  established  that  this  truly  reflects  the  enormous  amount  of  disorder
embodied by a black hole.

but disorder of what? as we have seen, black holes appear to be terribly simple objects, so
what  is  the  source  of  this  overwhelming  disorder?  on  this  question,  hawking's  calculations  were

pletely silent. his partial merger of general relativity and quantum mechanics could be used to
find the numerical value of a black hole's entropy, but offered no insight into its microscopic meaning.
for nearly a quarter of a century, some of the greatest physicists tried to understand what possible
microscopic properties of black holes could account for their entropy. but without a fully trustworthy
amalgam  of  quantum  mechanics  and  general  relativity,  glimpses  of  an  answer  may  have  been
uncovered, but the mystery remained unsolved.

enter string theory

or, it did until january 1996, when strominger and vafa—building on earlier insights of susskind and
sen—released  a  paper  to  the  electronic  physics  archive  entitled  "microscopic  origin  of  the
beckenstein-hawking entropy." in this work, strominger

and vafa were able to use string theory to
identify the microscopic constituents of a certain class of black holes and to calculate precisely their
associated entropy. their work relied on the newfound ability to partially circumvent the perturbative
approximations in use during the 1980s and early 1990s, and the result they found agreed exactly with
that predicted by bekenstein and hawking, finally completing a picture partially painted more than
two decades previously.

ecified  dimensions)  and  binding  them  together  according  to  a  precise  mathematical  blueprint.  in
much  the  same  way  that  an  atom  can  be  built—theoretically,  again—by  starting  with  a  bunch  of

quarks  and  electrons  and  then  precisely  arranging  them  into  protons  and  neutrons,  surrounded  by
orbiting  electrons,  strominger  and  vafa  showed  how  some  of  the  newfound  ingredients  in  string
theory could similarly be molded together to yield particular black holes.

in  actuality,  black  holes  are  one  possible  end  product  of  stellar  evolution.  after  a  star  has
burned all its nuclear fuel through billions of years of atomic fusion, it no longer has the strength—the
outward-directed  pressure—to  withstand  the  enormous  inward  force  of  gravity.  under  a  broad
spectrum  of  conditions,  this  results  in  a  cataclysmic  implosion  of  the  star's  enormous  mass;  it
violently collapses under its own tremendous weight, forming a bl

ack hole. contrary to this realistic
means of formation, strominger and vafa advocated "designer" black holes. they turned the tables on
black  hole  formation  by  showing  how  they  could  be  systematically  constructed—in  a  theorist's
imagination—by carefully, slowly, and meticulously weaving together a precise combination of the
branes that had emerged from the second superstring revolution.

the power of this approach became immediately clear. by maintaining full theoretical control
over the microscopic construction of their black holes, strominger and vafa could easily and directly
count

 the number of rearrangements of the black hole's microscopic constituents that would leave its
overall observable properties, its mass and force charges, unchanged. they could then compare this
number with the area of the black hole's horizon—the entropy predicted by bekenstein and hawking.
when strominger and vafa did so, they found perfect agreement. at least for the class of extremal
black holes, they had succeeded in using string theory to account for the microscopic constituents and
the associated entropy precisely. a quarter-century-old puzzle had been solved.6

many  string  theorists  view  this  success  as  an  important  and  convincing  piece  of  evidence  in
support of the theory. our understanding of string theory is still too coarse to be able to make direct
and precise contact with experimental observations of, say, the mass of a quark or an electron. but we

at  string  theory  has  provided  the  first  fundamental  explanation  of  a  long-established
property of black holes that has stumped physicists using more conventional theories for many years.
and  this  property  of  black  holes  is  intimately  tied  up  with  hawking's  prediction  that  they  should
radiate, a prediction that, in principle, should be experimentally measurable. of course, this requires
that we definitively find a black hole in the heavens and then construct equipment sensitive enough to
detect the radiation that it emits. if the black hole were light enough, the latter step is well within the
reach of current technology. even though this experimental program has not as yet met with success, it
does re-emphasize that the chasm between string theory and definitive physical statements about the
natural  world  can  be  bridged.  even  sheldon  glashow—the  archrival  of  string  theory  through  the
1980s—has sai

the remaining mysteries of black holes

even  with  these  impressive  developments,  there  are  still  two  central  mysteries  surrounding  black
holes. the first concerns the impact black holes have on the concept of determinism. in the beginning
of the nineteenth century the french mathematician pierre-simon de laplace enunciated the strictest
and most far-reaching consequence of the clockwork universe that followed from newton's laws of
motion:

an intelligence that, at a given instant, could comprehend all the forces by which nature is

animated and the respective situation of the beings that make it up, if moreover it were vast
enough  to  submit  these  data  to  analysis,  wou

occur  at  some  chosen  time  in  the  future  is  fully
determined  by  knowledge  of  the  wave  functions  at  any  prior  time.  the  probabilistic  aspect  of
quantum  mechanics  significantly  softens  laplacian  determinism  by  shifting  inevitability  from
outcomes  to  outcome-likelihoods,  but  the  latter  are  fully  determined  within  the  conventional
framework of quantum theory.

in 1976, hawking declared that even this softer form of determinism is violated by the presence
of black holes. once again, the calculations behind this declaration are formidable, but the essential
idea is fairly straightforward. when anything falls into a black hole, its wave function gets sucked in
as  well.  but  this  means  that  in  the  quest  to  work  out  wave  functions  at  all  future  times,  our  "vast
enough" intelligence will be irreparably shortchanged. to predict the future fully we need to know all
wave functions fully today. but, if some have escaped down the abyss of black holes,

 the information
they contain is lost.

at first sight, this complication arising from black holes may not seem worth worrying about.
since everything behind the event horizon of a black hole is cut off from the rest of the universe, can't
we  just  completely  ignore  anything  that  is  unfortunate  enough  to  have  fallen  in?  philosophically,
moreover, can't we tell ourselves that the universe has not really lost the information carried by the
stuff that has fallen into the black hole; it is simply locked within a region of space that we rational
beings choose to avoid at all costs? prior to hawking's realization that black holes are not completely
black, the answer to these questions was yes. but once hawking informed the world that black holes
radiate, the story changed. radiation carries energy and so, as a black hole radiates, its mass slowly

decreases—it slowly evaporates. as it does so, the distance from the center of the hole to the event
horizon slowly shrinks, a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd as this shroud recedes, regions of space that were previously cut off re-
enter the cosmic arena. now our philosophical musings must face the music: does the information
contained in the things swallowed by the black hole—the data we imagined existing within the black
hole's interior—re-emerge as the black hole evaporates? this is the information required for quantum
determinism to hold, and so this question goes to the heart of whether black holes imbue the evolution
of our universe with an even deeper element of happenstance.

as of this writing, there is no consensus among physicists regarding the answer to this question.
for many years, hawking has strongly claimed that the information does not re-emerge—that black
holes  destroy  information  thereby  "introducing  a  new  level  of  uncertainty  into  physics,  over  and
above the usual uncertainty associated with quantum theory."9  in  fact,  hawking,  together  with  kip
thorne

 of the california institute of technology, has a bet with john preskill, also of the california
institute of technology, regarding what happens to the information captured by a black hole: hawking
and thorne bet that the information is forever lost, while preskill has taken the opposite position and
bet that the information re-emerges as the black hole radiates and shrinks. the wager? information
itself: "the loser(s) will reward the winner(s) with an encyclopedia of the winner's choice."

the  bet  remains  unsettled,  but  hawking  has  recently  acknowledged  that  the  newfound
understanding of black holes from string theory, as discussed above, shows that there might be a way
for  the  information  to  re-emerge.10  the  new  idea  is  that  for  the  kind  of  black  holes  studied  by

 goal of current research. as hawking has put it,

most physicists want to believe that information is not lost, as this would make the world
safe and predictable. but i believe that if one takes einstein's general relativity seriously,
one must allow for the possibility that spacetime ties itself in knots and that information
gets lost in the folds. determining whether or not information actually does get lost is one
of the major questions in theoretical physics today.13

the second unresolved black hole mystery concerns the nature of spacetime at the central point
of  the  hole.14  a  straightforward  application  of  general  relativity,  going  all  the  way  back  to
schwarzschild in 1916, shows that the enormous mass and energy crushed together at the black hole's
center causes the fabric of spacetime to suffer a devastating rift, to be radically warped into a state of
infinite curvature—to be punctured by a spacetime singularity. one conclusion that physicists drew
from this is that sin
 
 ___________________________
 
ce all of the matter that has crossed the event horizon is inexorably drawn to the
center of the black hole, and since once there the matter has no future, time itself comes to an end at
the heart of a black hole. other physicists, who over the years have explored the properties of the
black hole's core using einstein's equations, revealed the wild possibility that it might be a gateway
to another universe that tenuously attaches to ours only at a black hole's center. roughly speaking,
where time in our universe comes to an end, time in the attached universe just begins.

we will take up some of the implications of this mind-boggling possibility in the next chapter,

but for now we want to stress one important point. we must recall the central lesson: extremes of
huge mass and small size leading to unimaginably large density invalidate the sole use of einstein's
classical theory and require that quantum mechanics be brought to bear as well. this l

eads us to ask,
what does string theory have to say about the spacetime singularity at the center of a black hole? this
is a topic of intense current research, but as with the question of information loss, it has not yet been
settled. string theory deftly deals with a variety of other singularities—the rips and tears in space
discussed in chapter 11 and in the first part of this chapter. 15 but if you have seen one singularity you
have not  seen  them  all.  the  fabric  of  our  universe  can  be  ripped,  punctured,  and  torn  in  many
different  ways.  string  theory  has  given  us  profound  insigh

ts  into  some  of  these  singularities,  but
others,  the  black  hole  singularity  among  them,  have  so  far  eluded  the  string  theorists'  reach.  the
essential  reason  for  this,  once  again,  is  the  reliance  on  perturbative  tools  in  string  theory  whose
approximations, in this case, cloud our ability to analyze reliably and fully what happens at the deep
interior point of a black hole.

however, given the recent tremendous progress in nonperturbative methods and their successful
application  to  other  aspects  of  black  holes,  string  theorists  have  high  hopes  that  it  won't  be  long
before the mysteries residing at the center of black holes start to unravel.

of "what's out there"—in a manner that dwarfs hubble's realization that the milky way is but one
galaxy among many—the concept of the multiverse does at least alert us to the possibility that we may
be asking too much of an ultimate theory.

a more radical musing comes from a proposal of lee smolin of penn state university, who,
inspired by the similarity between conditions at the big bang and at the centers of black holes—each
being characterized by a colossal density of crushed matter—has suggested that every black hole is
the seed for a new universe that erupts into existence through a big bang–like explosion, but is forever

and  that  our  "extended  ultimate  theory"  might  tell  us  precisely  why  and  how  the  values  of  the
fundamental parameters are sprinkled across the constituent universes.

hidden from our view by the black hole's event horizon. beyond proposing another mechanism for
generating a multiverse, smolin has injected a new element—a cosmic version of genetic mutation—
that  does  an  end  run  around  the  scientific  limitations  associated  with  the  anthropic  principle.9
imagine,  he  suggests,  that  when  a  universe  sprouts  from  the  core  of  a  black  hole,  its  physical
attributes,  such  as  particle  masses  and  force  strengths,  are  close,  but  not  identical,  to  those  of  its

rent universe. since black holes arise from extinguished stars, and star formation depends upon the
precise values of the particle masses and force strengths, the fecundity of any given universe—the
number  of  black  hole  progeny  it  can  produce—depends  sensitively  on  these  parameters.  small
variations in the parameters of the progeny universes will therefore lead to some that are even more
optimized for black hole production than their parent universe, and have an even greater number of
offspring universes of their own.10 after many "generations," the descendants of universes optimized
for producing black holes will thus be so numerous that they will overwhelm the population of the
multiverse.  and  so,  rather  than  invoking  the  anthropic  principle,  smolin's  suggestion  provides  a
dynamic  mechanism  that,  on  average,  drives  the  parameters  of  each  next-generation  universe  ever

this  approach  gives  another  method,  even  in  the  context  of  the  multiverse,  in  which  the

typical  member  of  a  mature  multiverse  (these  are  big  "ifs"  and  can  be  debated  on  many  fronts,  of
course), the parameters of the particles and forces that we measure should be optimized for black

by working with five—not four—extended spacetime dimensions. surprisingly, after completing their
calculation of the entropy of such a five-dimensional black hole they realized that no theoretician had
as yet constructed such hypothetical extremal black holes in the setting of five-dimensional general
relativity. since only by comparing their answer to the area of the event horizon of such a hypothetical
black  hole  could  they  confirm  their  results,  strominger  and  vafa  then  set  out  to  mathematically

speculated over the years that there might be a central "nugget" embedded in the depths of a black
hole that stores all of the information carried by matter that gets trapped within the hole's horizon.

15. in fact, the space-tearing conifold transitions discussed in this chapter involve black holes
and hence might seem to be tied up with the question of their singularities. but recall that the conifold

questions concerning black hole singularities.

its event horizon—and not by the total volume of space that the event horizon bounds. therefore, the
disorder  of  a  black  hole,  and  correspondingly  the  information  it  can  embody,  is  encoded  in  the
two-dimensional data of surface area. it is almost as if the event horizon of the black hole acts like a
hologram  by  capturing  all  the  information  content  of  the  black  hole's  three-dimensional  interior.
susskind and 't hooft have general

 fundamental  building  block  of  matter,  consisting  of  a nucleus  (comprising protons  and
neutrons) and an orbiting swarm of electrons.
big bang.  currently  accepted  theory  that  the  expanding  universe  began  some  15  billion  years  ago
from a state of enormous energy, density, and compression.
big crunch. one hypothesized future for the universe in which the current expansion stops, reverses,
and results in all space and all matter collapsing together; a reversal of the big bang.
black hole. an object whose immense gravitational field entraps anything, even light, that gets too
close (closer than the black hole's event horizon).
black-hole entropy the entropy embodied within a black hole.
boson. a particle, or pattern of string vibration, with a whole number amount of spin; typically a
messenger particle.
bosonic string theory. first known string theory; contains vibrational patterns that are all bosons.
bps states. configurations in a supersymmetric theory whose properties can be

eleven-dimensional supergravity. promising higher-dimensional supergravity theory developed in
the 1970s, subsequently ignored, and more recently shown to be an important part of string theory.
entropy.  a  measure  of  the  disorder  of  a  physical  system;  the  number  of  rearrangements  of  the

the weak  force  and  the

ingredients of a system that leave its overall appearance intact.
equivalence principle. see principle of equivalence.
event horizon. the one-way surface of a black hole; once penetrated, the laws of gravity ensure that
there is no turning back, no escaping the powerful gravitational grip of the black hole.
extended  dimension.  a  space  (and spacetime)  dimension  that  is  large  and  directly  apparent;  a
dimension with which we are ordinarily familiar, as opposed to a curled-up dimension.
extremal black holes. black holes endowed with the maximal amount of force charge possible for a
given total mass.
families. organization of matter particles into three

special relativity, in which a moving object appears
shortened along its direction of motion.
macroscopic. refers to scales typically encountered in the everyday world and larger; roughly the
opposite of microscopic.
massless  black  hole.  in  string  theory,  a  particular  kind  of black  hole  that  may  have  large  mass
initially, but that becomes ever lighter as a piece of the calabi-yau portion of space shrinks. when
the portion of space has shrunk down to a point, the initially massive black hole has no remaining
mass—it is massless. in this state, it no longer manifests such usual black hole properties as an event
horizon.
maxwell's  theory,  maxwell's  electromagnetic  theory.  theory  uniting  electricity  and  magnetism,

based  on  the  concept  of  the electromagnetic  field,  devised  by  maxwell  in  the  1880s;  shows  that
visible light is an example of an electromagnetic wave.
messenger particle. smallest bundle of a force field; microscopic conveyer of a force.
