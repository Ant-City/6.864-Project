england is safe, if true within it selfe?
  mount. but the safer, when 'tis back'd with france

let vs be back'd with god, and with the seas,
which he hath giu'n for fence impregnable,
and with their helpes, onely defend our selues:
in them, and in our selues, our safetie lyes

   clar. for this one speech, lord hastings well deserues

and for this once, my will shall stand for law

   rich. and yet me thinks, your grace hath not done well,
to giue the heire and daughter of lord scales

shee better would haue fitted me, or clarence:
but in your bride you burie brotherhood

they are alreadie, or quickly will be landed:
my selfe in person will straight follow you.

but ere i goe, hastings and mountague
resolue my doubt: you twaine, of all the rest,
are neere to warwicke, by bloud, and by allyance:
tell me, if you loue warwicke more then me;
if it be so, then both depart to him:
i rather wish you foes, then hollow friends.
but if you minde to hold your true obedience,
giue me assurance with some friendly vow,
that i may neuer haue you in suspect
