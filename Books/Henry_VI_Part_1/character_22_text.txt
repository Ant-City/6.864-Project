    that thus delays my promised supply
    of horsemen that were levied for this siege!
    renowned talbot doth expect my aid,
    and i am louted by a traitor villain

    who now is girdled with a waist of iron
    and hemm'd about with grim destruction.
    to bordeaux, warlike duke! to bordeaux, york!
    else, farewell talbot, france, and england's honour.
  york. o god, that somerset, who in proud heart
    doth stop my cornets, were in talbot's place!

    mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep

  lucy. o, send some succour to the distress'd lord!
  york. he dies; we lose; i break my warlike word.
    we mourn: france smiles. we lose: they daily get-
    all long of this vile traitor somerset.
  lucy. then god take mercy on brave talbot's soul,
    and on his son, young john, who two hours since
    i met in travel toward his warlike father.
    this seven years did not talbot see his son;
    and now they meet where both their lives are done.
  york. alas, what joy shall noble talbot have
    to bid his young son welcome to his grave?
    away! vexation almost stops my breath,
    that sund'red friends greet in the hour of death.
    lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can

    this expedition was by york and talbot
    too rashly plotted; all our general force
    might with a sally of the very town
    be buckled with. the over daring talbot
    hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
    by this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure.
    york set him on to fight and die in shame.
    that, talbot dead, great york might bear the name.

  somerset. how now, sir william! whither were you sent?
  lucy. whither, my lord! from bought and sold lord
    talbot,
    who, ring'd about with bold adversity,
    cries out for noble york and somerset
    to beat assailing death from his weak legions;
    and whiles the honourable captain there
    drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs

    you, his false hopes, the trust of england's honour,
    keep off aloof with worthless emulation.
    let not your private discord keep away
    the levied succours that should lend him aid,
    while he, renowned noble gentleman,
    yield up his life unto a world of odds.
    orleans the bastard, charles, burgundy,
    alencon, reignier, compass him about,
    and talbot perisheth by your default.
  somerset. york set him on; york should have sent him aid.
  lucy. and york as fast upon your grace exclaims,
    swearing that you withhold his levied host,
    collected for this expedition.
  somerset. york lies; he might have sent and had the horse.
    i owe him little duty and less love,
    and take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.
  lucy. the fraud of england, not the force of france,
    hath now entrapp'd the noble minded talbot.
    never to england shall he bear his life,
    but dies betray'd to fortune by your strife.

  lucy. too late comes rescue; he is ta'en or slain,

    and fly would talbot never, though he might.
