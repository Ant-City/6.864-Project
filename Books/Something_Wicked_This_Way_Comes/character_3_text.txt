but you take october, now.school's been on a month and you're riding easier in the reins,
jogging along.you got time to think of the garbage you'll dump on old man prickett's porch, or
the hairy-ape costume you'll wear to the ymca the last night of the month.and if it's around
october twentieth and everything smoky-smelling and the sky orange and ash grey at twilight,
it seems hallowe'en will never come in a fall of broomsticks and a soft flap of bedsheets around
corners.
but one strange wild dark long year, hallowe'en came early.
one year hallowe'en came on october 24, three hours after midnight.
at that time, james nightshade of 97 oak street was thirteen years, eleven months,
twenty-three days old. next door, william halloway was thirteen years, eleven months and
twenty-four days old.both touched toward fourteen; it almost trembled in their hands.
and that was the october week when they grew up overnight, and were never so young any
more…

the storm salesman nodded as if he had known it all along.
'nightshade. that's quite a name.'
'and only fitting,' said will halloway. 'i was born one minute before midnight, october thirtieth,
jim was born one minute after midnight, which makes it october thirty-first.'
'hallowe'en,' said jim.
by their voices, the boys had told the tale all their lives, proud of their mothers, living house
next to house,running for the hospital together, bringing sons into the world seconds apart;
one light, one dark. there was a history of mutual celebration behind them.each year will lit
the candles on a single cake at one minute to midnight. jim, at one minute after, with the last
day of the month begun, blew them out.
so much will said, excitedly.so much jim agreed to, silently.so much the salesman,running
before the storm, but poised here uncertainly, heard looking from face to face.
'halloway. nightshade. no money, you say?'
the man, grieved by his own conscientiousness,rummaged in his leather bag and

but will was staring beyond the man now.
'which,' he said. 'which house will it strike?'
'which? hold on. wait.' the salesman searched deep in their faces. 'some folks draw
lightning, suck it like cats suck babies' breath.some folks' polarities are negative, some
positive.some glow in the dark.some snuff out.you now, the two…i- '
'what makes you so sure lightning will strike anywhere around here?' said jim suddenly, his
eyes bright.
the salesman almost flinched. 'why, i got a nose, an eye, an ear.both those houses, their
timbers! listen!'
they listened. maybe their houses leaned under the cool afternoon wind. maybe not.

itching to let lightning pour through! tonight!'

countries. here alien deserts slumbered. up front was the desk where the nice old lady, miss
watriss, purple-stamped your books, but down off away were tibet and antarctica, the congo.
there went miss wills, the other librarian, through outer mongolia, calmly toting fragments of
peiping and yokohama and the celebes. way down the third book corridor, an oldish man
whispered his broom along in the dark, mounding the fallen…
will stared.
it was always a surprise - that old man, his work, his name.
that's charles william halloway, thought will, not grand-father, not far-wandering, ancient
uncle, as some might think, but…my father.
so, looking back down the corridor, was dad shocked to see he owned a son who visited this
separate 20,000-fathoms-deep world? dad always seemed stunned when will rose up before
him, as if they had met a lifetime ago and one had grown old while the other stayed yo

'heck.' said jim.
'no such place as heck.but hell's right here under 'a' for alighieri.'
'allegory's beyond me,' said jim.
'how stupid of me,' dad laughed. 'i mean dante. look at this.pictures by mister doré,
showing all the aspects. hell never looked better. here's souls sunk to their gills in slime.

'boy howdy!' jim eyed the pages two different ways and thumbed on. 'got any dinosaur

'will,' said the old man who was also a janitor who happened to be his father, 'what about
you?'
'huh?' will shook himself.
'you need a white-hat or a black-hat book?'
'hats?' said will.
'well, jim - ' they perambulated, dad running his fingers along the book spines - 'he wears
the black ten-gallon hats and reads books to fit. middle name's moriarty,right, jim? any day
now he'll move up from fu manchu to machiavelli here - medium-size dark fedora. or over

'you don't mind,' said will, 'i'll settle for the mysterious island.'

'why - ' dad handed jules verne to will - 'it's just, a long time ago, i had to decide, myself,

what's the answer, he wondered, walking through the library, putting out the lights, putting
out the lights, putting out the lights, is it all in the whorls on our thumbs and fingers? why are
some people all grasshopper fiddlings, scrapings, all antennae shivering, one big ganglion
eternally knotting, slip-knotting, square-knotting themselves? they stoke a furnace all their
lives, sweat their lips, shine their eyes and start it all in the crib. caesar's lean and hungry
friends. they eat the dark, who only stand and breathe.
that's jim, all bramble-hair and itchweed.
and will? why he's the last peach, high on the summer tree.some boys walk by and you cry,
seeing them. they feel good, they look good, they are good. oh, they're not above peeing off a
bridge, or stealing an occasional dime-store pencil sharpener; it's not that. it's just, you know,
seeing them pass, that's how they'll be all their life; they'll get hit, hurt, cut, bruised, and always
wonder why, why does it happen? how can

'boy!' yelled will. 'folks run like they thought the storm was here!'
'it is!' shouted jim. 'us!'
they stomp-pound-thundered over iron grates, steel trap-doors, past a dozen unlit shops, a
dozen half-lit, a dozen dying dark. the city was dead as they rounded the united cigar store
corner to see a wooden cherokee glide in darkness, by himself.
'hey!'
mr tetley, the proprietor, peered over the indian's shoulder.
'scare you, boys?'
'naw!'
but will shivered, feeling cold tidal waves of strange rain moving down the prairie as on a
deserted shore. when the lightning nailed the town, he wanted to be layered under sixteen
blankets and a pillow.

charles halloway put his hand to the saloon's double swing doors, hesitant, as if the grey
hairs on the back of his hand, like antennae, had felt something beyond slide by in the october
night.perhaps great fires burned somewhere and their furnace blasts warned him not to step
forth. or another ice age had loomed across the land, its freezing bulk might already have laid
waste a billion people in the hour.perhaps time itself fixed was draining off down an immense
glass, with powdered darkness failing after to bury all.
or maybe it was only that man in a dark suit, seen through the saloon window, across the
street. great paper rolls under one arm, a brush and bucket in his free hand, the man was
whistling a tune, very far away.
it was a tune from another season, one that never ceased making charles halloway sad
when he heard it. the song was incongruous for october, but immensely moving,
overwhelming, no matter what day or what month it was sung:
i heard the bells on christmas da

the hand clenched, tight. it waved. the man swept around the corner. charles halloway,
stunned, flushed with sudden summer heat, swayed, then turned to gaze into the empty shop.
two sawhorses stood parallel to each other under a single spotlight.
placed over these two sawhorses like a funeral of snow and crystal was a block of ice six
feet long. it shone dimly with its own effulgence, and its colour was light green-blue. it was a
great cool gem resting there in the dark.
on a little white placard at one side near the window the following calligraphic message
could be read by lamplight:
cooger dark's pandemonium shadow show -
fantoccini, marionette circus, and your
plain meadow carnival.arriving
immediately! here on display, one of
our many attractions:

halloway's eyes leaped to the poster on the inside of the window.
and back to the cold long block of ice.
it was such a block of ice as he remembered from travelling magicia

boy, when the local ice company contributed a chunk of winter in which, for twelve hours on
end, frost maidens lay embedded, on display while people watched and comedies toppled
down the raw white screen and coming attractions came and went and at last the pale ladies
slid forth all rimed, chipped free by perspiring sorcerers to be led off smiling into the dark behind
the curtains.
the most beautiful woman in the world
and yet this vast chunk of wintry glass held nothing but frozen river water.
no. not quite empty.
halloway felt his heart pound one special time.
within the huge winter gem was there not a special vacuum? a voluptuous hollow, a
prolonged emptiness which undulated from tip to toe of the ice? and wasn't this vacuum, this
emptiness waiting to be filled with summer flesh, was it not shaped somewhat like a…woman?
yes.

but charles halloway stood in the strange night for a long time looking in at the empty shop
and the two sawhorses and the cold waiting arctic coffin set there like a vast star of india in

jim nightshade stopped at the comer of hickory and main, breathing easily, his eyes fixed
tenderly on the leafy darkness of hickory street.
'will…?'
'no!' will stopped, surprised at his own violence.
'it is just there. the fifth house. just one minute, will,' jim pleaded, softly.
'minute…?' will glanced down the street.
which was the street of the theatre.
until this summer it had been an ordinary street where they stole peaches, plums and
apricots, each in its day.but late in august,

to touch each other.
'what're they doing i thought will. why are they laughing? what's wrong with them, what's
wrong!?
he wished the light would go out.
but he hung tight to the suddenly slippery tree and watched the bright window theatre,
heard the laughing and numb at last let go, slid, fell, lay dazed, then stood in dark gazing up at
jim, who still clung to his high limb. jim's face, hearth-flushed, cheeks fire-fuzzed, lips parted,
stared in. 'jim, jim come down!' but jim did not hear. 'jim!' and when jim looked down at last
he saw will as a stranger below with some silly request to give off living and come down to
earth.so will ran off, alone, thinking too much, knowing what to think.

will looked at jim now, with the library books in his hands.

will grabbed the paper, laughing, pulled it off, let it fly! he stopped laughing.
the boys, watching the pale throwaway rattle and flit through the trees, were suddenly cold.
'wait a minute…' said jim, slowly.
all of a sudden they were yelling,running, leaping. 'don't tear it! careful!
the paper fluttered like a snare drum in their hands.
'coming, october twenty-fourth!'
their lips moved, shadowing the words set in rococo type.
'cooger and dark's…'
'carnival!'
'october twenty-fourth! that's tomorrow!'
'it can't be,' said will. 'all carnivals stop after labour day - '

'no, it's just - get it!
the wind had tom the paper from their hands.
the handbill blew over the trees and away in an idiot caper, gone.
'it s not true, anyway,' will gasped. carnivals don't come this late in the year.silly darnsounding

'me.' jim stood quiet in the dark.

and the sulphur-skinned devil-man sipping lava, like gunpowder tea.
'that music…' jim murmured. 'calliope. must be coming tonight!'
'carnivals come at sunrise.'
‘yeah, but what about the licorice and cotton candy we smelled, close?'

colour paper lay crushed, its rococo type hidden, in his father's fingers.
'hey!'
will stepped into the parlour.
immediately mom opened a smile that was like lighting a second fire.
dad stricken, looked dismayed, as if caught in a criminal act.
will wanted to say, 'hey, what'd you think of the handbill…?
but dad was cramming the handbill deep in the chair upholstery.
and mother was leafing the library books.
'oh, these are fine, willy!'
so will just stood with cooger and dark on his tongue and said:
'boy, the wind really flew us home.streets full of paper blowing.'
dad did not flinch at this.
'anything new, dad?'
dad's hand still lay tucked in the side of the chair. he lifted a grey, slightly worried, very tired
gaze to his son:
'stone lion blew off the library steps.prowling the town now looking for christians. won't find
any. got the only one no in captivity here, and she's a good cook.'
'bosh,' said mom.
walking upstairs, will heard what he half expected to hear.

a soft fluming sigh as something fresh was tossed on the fire. in his mind, he saw dad
standing at the hearth looking down as the paper crinkled to ash:
'…cooger… dark… carnival… witch… wonders…'
he wanted to go back down and stand with dad hands out, to be warmed by the fire.
instead he went slowly up to shut the door of his room.
some nights, abed, will put his ear to the wall to listen, and if his folks talked things that
were right, he stayed, and if not right he turned away. if it was about time and passing years or

no one else in the world had a name came so well off the tongue.
'jim nightshade. that's me.'
jim stood tall and now lay long in bed, strung together by marsh-grass, his bones easy in his
flesh, his flesh easy on his bones. the library books lay unopened-by his relaxed right hand.
waiting, his eyes were dark as twilight, with shadows under the eyes from the time, his
mother said, he had almost died when he was three and still remembered. his hair was dark
autumn chestnut and the veins in his temples and brow and in his neck and ticking in his wrists
and on the backs of his slender hands, all these were dark blue. he was marbled with dark, was

'you going to collect rocks, jim? no, some day, you've got to be hurt.'
'no, i don't'
he looked at her. her face had been hit a long time ago. the bruises had never gone from
around her eyes.
'you'll live and get hurt,' she said, in the dark. 'but when it's time, tell me.say good-bye.
otherwise, i might not let you go. wouldn't that be terrible, to just grab ahold?'
she rose up suddenly and went to put the window down.

n cameo perfection, on the shell of his eyelids.
the lightning-rod salesman remembered to breathe.
once, long ago, travelling among the marbles of rome and florence, he had seen women
like this, kept in stone instead of ice. once, wandering in the louvre, he had found women like
this, washed in summer colour and kept in paint. once, as a boy, sneaking the cool grottoes
behind a motion picture theatre screen, on his way to a free seat, he had glanced up and there
towering and flooding the haunted dark seen a women's face as he had never seen it since, of
such size and beauty built of milk-bone and moon-flesh, at to freeze him there alone behind
the stage, shadowed by the, motion of her lips, the bird-wing flicker of her eyes, the snow-paledeath-shimmering
illumination from her cheeks.
so from other years there jumped forth images which flowed and found new substance here
within the ice.
what colour was her hair? it was blonde to whiteness and might take any colour, once set
free of cold.

sometimes you see a kite so high, so wise it almost knows the wind. it travels, then chooses
to land in one spot and no other and no matter how you yank,run this way or that, it will simply
break its cord, seek its resting place and bring you, blood-mouthed,running.
'jim! wait for me!'
so now jim was the kite, the wild twine cut, and whatever wisdom was his taking him away
from will who could only run, earthbound, after one so high and dark silent and suddenly
strange.
'jim, here i come!'

as if exhaling itself straight down from the sky, a vast moss-green balloon touched at the
moon.
it hovered two hundred yards above and away, quietly riding the wind.
'the basket under the balloon, someone in it!'
but then a tall man stepped down from the train caboose platform like a captain assaying
the tidal weathers of this inland sea.all dark suit, shadow-faced, he waded to the centre of the
meadow, his shirt as black as the gloved hands he now stretched to the sky.
he gestured, once.
and the train came to life.
at first a head lifted in one window, then an arm, then another head like a puppet in a
marionette theatre.suddenly two men in black were carrying a dark tent-pole out across the
hissing grass.
it was the silence that made will pull back, even as jim leaned forward eyes moon-bright.
a carnival should be all growls,roars like

dust, men ablaze with working anger, pop bottles jangling, horse
buckles shivering, engines and elephants in full stampede through rains of sweat while zebras
neighed and trembled like cage trapped in cage.
but this was like old movies, the silent theatre haunted with black-and-white ghosts, silvery
mouth opening to let moon-light smoke out, gestures made in silence so hushed you could
hear the wind fizz the hair on your cheeks. more shadows rustled from the train, passing the
animal cages where darkness prowled with unlit eyes and the calliope stood mute save for the
faintest idiot tune the breeze piped wandering up the flues.
the ringmaster stood in the middle of the land. the balloon like a vast mouldy green cheese
stood fixed to the sky. then darkness came.
the last thing will saw was the balloon swooping down, as clouds covered the moon.
in the night he felt the men rush to unseen tasks. he sensed the balloon, like a great fat
spider, fiddling with the lines and poles,rearing a tapestr

forward, seized his ankle, felt him stiffen.
'wait!' said will. 'they're bringing out the canvas!'
'no,' said jim. 'oh, no…'
for somehow instead, they both knew, the wires high-flung on the poles were catching swift
clouds,ripping them free from the wind in streamers which, stitched and sewn by some great
monster shadow, made canvas and more canvas as the tent took shape.at last there was the
clear-water sound of vast flags blowing.
the motion stopped. the darkness within darkness was still.

drummed down to live, to breathe, to survive in the night meadow.

wandering alone in the library, letting his broom tell him things no one else could hear, he
had heard the whistle and the disjointed-calliope hymns.
'three,' he now said, half-aloud. 'three in the morning…'
in the meadow the tents, the carnival waited. waited for someone, anyone to wade along
the grassy surf. the great tents filled like bellows. they softly issued forth exhalations of air
that smelled like ancient yellow beasts.
but only the moon looked in at the hollow dark, the deep caverns. outside, night beasts
hung in midgallop on a carousel.beyond lay fathoms of mirror maze which housed a multifold
series of empty vanities one wave on another, still, serene, silvered with age, white with time.
any shadow, at the entrance, might stir reverberations the colour of fright, unravel deep-buried
moons.

that holds fast and binds eternity. they live inside the gift, know power, accept, and need not
mention it. why speak of time when you are time, and shape the universal moments, as they
pass, into warmth and action? how men envy and often hate these warm clocks, these wives,

ents plumed like thunder clouds. instead, close up, the carnival was mildewed
rope, moth-eaten canvas,rain-worn, sun-bleached tinsel. the side-show paintings, hung like
sad albatrosses on their poles, flapped and let fall flakes of ancient paint, shivering and at the
same time revealing the unwondrous wonders of a thin man, fat-man, needle-head, tattooed
man, hula dancer…
they prowled on but found no mysterious midnight sphere of evil gas tied by mysterious
oriental knots to daggers plunged in dark earth, no maniac ticket takers bent on terrible
revenges. the calliope by the ticket booth neither screamed deaths nor hummed idiot songs
to itself. the train? pulled off on a spur in the warming grass, it was old, yes, and welded tight
with rust, but it looked like a titanic magnet that had collected to itself, from locomotive boneyards
across three continents, drive shafts, flywheels, smoke stacks, and hand-me-down
second-rate nightmares. it did not cut a black and mortuary silhouette. it ask

'will…' jim sighed faintly. 'let me be.'
'like heck!' with one leap, will grabbed jim's belt and hauled.shuffling backward, jim did not
seem to know he was being dragged from the maze, for he kept protesting in awe at some
unseen wonder: 'oh, will, oh, willy, will, oh, willy…'
'jim, you nut. i'm taking you home!'
'what? what? what?'
they were in cold air. the sky was darker than plums now, with a few clouds burning late
sun-fire above. the sun-fire flamed on jim's feverish cheeks, his open lips, his wide and terribly
rich green shining eyes.
'jim, what'd you see in there? the same as miss foley?'
'what, what?
'i'm gonna, bust your nose! come on!' he hustled, pulled, shoved, half carried this fever, this
elation, unstruggling friend.
'can't tell you, will, wouldn't believe, can't tell you, in there, oh, in there, in there…'
'shut up!' will socked his arm. 'scar

'look who needs protection.' will laughed and then did not laugh again, for jim was looking
at him, the last wild light dying in his mouth, and caught in the thin hollows of his nostrils and in
his suddenly deep-set eyes.
'you'll always be with me, huh, will?'
jim simply breathed warm upon him and his blood stirred with the old, the familiar answers:
yes, yes, you know it, yes, yes.
and turning together, they stumbled over a clanking dark mound of leather bag.

they stood for a long moment over the huge leather bag.
almost secretively, will kicked it. it made the sound of iron indigestion.
'why,' said will, 'that belongs to the lightning-rod salesman!'
jim slipped his hand through the leather mouth and hefted forth a metal shaft clustered with
chimeras, chinese dragons all fang, eyeball and moss-green armour, all cross and crescent;
every symbol around the world that made men safe, or seemed to, clung there, greaving the

'why - ' jim examined his friend, curiously, twilight in his face - 'no one can tell you.you find it

we might never know.'
'jim, in ten minutes - '
'sure! midway'll be dark.everyone home for dinner. just us alone.but won't it feel great?
just us! and here we go, back in!'
passing the mirror maze, they saw two armies - a billion jims, a billion wills - collide, melt,
vanish.and like those armies, so vanished the real army of people.
they boys stood alone among the encampments of dusk thinking of all the boys in town
sitting down to warm food in bright rooms.

jim ambled across the clanking chain, leaped to a turntable surface vast as the moon,

'will, this is the only ride we haven’t looked at.so…'
jim swayed. the lunatic carousel world stirred atilt with his lean bulk. he strolled through
brass forests amidst animal rousts. he swung astride a plum-dusk stallion.
'ho, boy, git!'
a man rose from machinery darkness.
'jim!'
reaching out from the shadows among the calliope tubes and moon-skinned drums the
man hoisted jim yelling out on the air.
'help, will, help!'
will leaped through the animals.
the man smiled easily, welcomed him handily, swung him high beside jim. they stared down
at bright flame-red hair, bright flame-blue eyes, and rippling biceps.

swiftly, and with utter clearness, it was the suit which fascinated will. for it seemed woven of
boar-bramble, clock-spring hair, bristle, and a sort of ever-trembling, ever-glistening dark hemp.
the suit caught light and stirred like a bed of black tweed-thorns, interminably itching, covering
the man's long body with motion so it seemed he should excruciate, cry out, and tear the
clothes free.yet here he stood, moon-calm, inhabiting his itch-weed suit and watching jim's
mouth with his yellow eyes. he never looked once at will.

he flourished a white calling card. it turned blue.

rummaged, and held out his hand.

mr dark exploded his laugh. 'superb! i will!' he extended his hand. his shirt sleeve pulled up.

wrist.
'boy!' cried will. 'you must be the tattooed man!'
'no.' jim studied the stranger. 'the illustrated man. there's a difference.'
mr dark nodded, pleased. 'what's your name, boy?'
don't tell him! thought will, and stopped. why not? he wondered, why?
jim's lips hardly twitched.

he smiled to show it was a lie.
mr dark smiled to show he knew it.
'want to see more, ‘simon’?'
jim would not give him the satisfaction of a nod.

reflection in a shop window late at night. the tall man's brambled suit, shadowed out now to
colour jim's cheeks and storm over his wide and drinking eyes with a look of rain instead of the
sharp cat-green they always were. jim stood like a runner who has come a long way, fever in
his mouth, hands open to receive any gift.and right now it was a gift of pictures twitched in
pantomime, as mr dark made his illustrious jerk cold-skinned over his warm-pulsed wrist as the
stars came out above and, jim stared and will could not see and a long way off the last of the

mr dark and mr cooger were turned away, busy with the merry-go-round.

will jumped. jim hauled him up. the great tree shook.a wind roared by in the sky. jim helped
him cling, gasping, among the branches.

somewhere in the carousel machinery there were taps and brass knockings, a faint squeal
and whistle of calliope steam.

'clear!' someone shouted at the far end of the midway.
mr dark moved, not fifty feet away to a red control box near the merry-go-round ticket
booth. he glared in all directions. he glared into the tree.

with a pop, a bang, a jangle of reins, a lift and downfall, a rise and descent of brass, the
carousel moved.

limb, tried to catch the tune, then hum it forward in his head.but the brass bells, the drums,
hammered his chest,revved his heart so he felt his pulse reverse, his blood turn back in
perverse thrusts through all his flesh, so he was nearly shaken free to fall, so all he did was
clutch, hang pale, and drink the sight of the backward-turning machine and mr dark, alert at
the controls, on the sidelines.
it was jim who first noticed the new thing happening, for he kicked will, once, will looked
over, and jim nodded frantically at the man in the machine as he came around the next time.
mr cooger's face was melting like pink wax.
his hands were becoming doll's hands.
his bones sank away beneath his clothes; his clothes then shrank down to fit his dwindling
frame.
his face flickered going, and each time around he melted more.

the small shape, stepped down from the silent world, its face in shadow, but its hands
newborn wrinkled pink, held out in raw carnival lamplight.
the strange man-boy shot his gaze up, down, smelling fright somewhere, terror and awe in
the vicinity. will balled himself tight and shut his eyes. he felt the terrible gaze shoot through
the leaves like brown needle-darts, pass on. then,rabbit-running, the small shape lit off down
the empty midway.
jim was first to stir the leaves aside.
mr dark was gone, too, in the evening hush.
it seemed to take jim forever to fall down to earth. will fell after and they both stood,
clamorous with alarms, shaken by concussions of silent pantomime, blasted by events all the
more numbing because they ran off into the night unknown.and it was jim who spoke from
their mutual confusion and trembling as each held to the other's arm, seeing the small shadow
rush, luring them across the meadow.

possibly guess where.

out on the highway the last faint water-colours of the sun were gone beyond the hills and
whatever they were chasing was so far ahead as to be only a swift-fleck now shown in
lamplight, now set free,running, into dark.
'twenty-eight!' gasped jim, 'twenty-eight times!'
'the merry-go-round, sure!' will jerked his head. 'twenty-eight times i counted, it went
around back!'
up ahead the small shape stopped and looked back.
jim and will ducked in by a tree and let it move on.

the dog plato, the wilderness philosopher, for you saw by his eyes there was nothing he didn't
know. returned, the dog would live in innocence again, tread patterns of grace, for months,
then vanish, and the whole thing start over. now, walking here he thought he heard jim
whimper under his breath. he could feel the bristles stiffen all over jim. he felt jim's ears
flatten, saw him sniff the new dark. jim smelled smells that no one knew, heard ticks from
clocks that told another time.even his tongue was strange now, moving along his lower, and
now his upper lip as they stopped in front of miss foley's house again.
the front window was empty.
'going to walk up and ring the bell,' said jim.
'what, meet him face to face?!'

jim glared at him. miss foley laughed.
'why shouldn't i be?'

she held the door wide.

beyond miss foley, a beaded curtain hung like a dark blue thunder shower across the parlour
entry.
where the coloured rain touched the floor, a pair of dusty small shoes poked out. just
beyond the downpour the evil boy loitered.
evil? will blinked. why evil? because. 'because' was reason enough.a boy, yes, and evil.

now a pink face stuck out through the dim frozen necklaces of storm.

jim struck will's elbow, hard, to shut him.
now the body came out through the dark watery flow of beads. the rain shushed behind the
small boy.
miss foley leaned toward him, expectant. jim gripped his elbow, fiercely. he stammered,
flushed, then spat it out:
'mr crosetti!'
quite suddenly, clearly he saw the sign in the barber's window. the sign seen but not seen
as they ran by:
closed on account of illness.

robert.

everyone looked at will as if amazed he didn't want to stick here forever.

ten-fifteen. ten-thirty.
no music.
will did not like jim sitting in his room thinking what? of the mirror maze? what had he seen
there? and, seeing, what did he plan?
will stirred,restively.
especially he did not like to think of jim with no father between him and the tent shows and
all that lay dark in the meadows.and a mother who wanted him around so very much, he just
had to get away, get out, breathe free night air, know free night waters running toward bigger
freer seas.
jim! he thought. let's have the music!
and at ten-thirty-five, it came.
he heard, or thought he heard, jim out in the starlight leaping way up and coming flat down
like a spring tomcat on the vast xylophone.and the tune! was or wasn't it like the funeral dirge

he felt the shadow sift down through the house like a cold breath. he could wait no longer.
he leaped forth.

he seized jim's arm.

he thought he heard the agonized figure sprawled on the carousel platform drum his heart
superfast, then slow, fast, slow, very fast, very slow, incredibly fast, then as slow as the moon
going down the sky on a white night in winter.

up in a phone booth, and now saw the police car bouncing along the road, its siren moaning,
with the ambulance behind.all the men looked out at the two boys whose teeth chattered in
the moth-flicked light.
three minutes later they all advanced down the dark midway, jim leading the way, talking,
gibbering.

tents. 'you hear? we're sorry!'

destiny on a ledge within the coffin. her eyes did not see; they were sewn shut with laced
black-widow web, dark threads.a waxworks fright, good and proper, she was, and the
policemen beamed, viewing her, and strolled on, and beamed at monsieur guillotine for his act
too, and moving, the police were relaxing now, and seemed not to mind being called late on a
jolly venture into a rehearsing world of acrobats and seedy magicians.

now part of the wasp-needle tattooed population spoke. it was mr dark's mouth over and
above this calligraphic explosion, this railroad accident of monsters in tumult upon his sweating
skin. mr dark chanted forth the organ tones from his chest. his personal electric blue-green
populations trembled, even as the real freaks on the sawdust tent floor trembled, even as,
hearing in their most secret marrow, jim and will trembled and felt more freak than the freaks
themselves.
'gentlemen! boys! we've just perfected the new act! you'll be the first to see!' cried mr dark.
the first policeman, his hand casually nestled to his pistol holster, squinted up at that vast
corral of beasts and beings. 't

calmed as the carnival owner continued with great ease, patting and soothing his own
illustrations, which somehow patted and soothed the freaks. 'said? but what did he see? boys
always scare themselves at sideshows, eh? run like rabbits when the freaks pop out.but
tonight, especially tonight!'
the policemen glanced beyond to the erector-set-papier mâché relic constricted in the
electric chair.
'who's he?'
will saw fire lick up through mr dark's smoke-clouded eyes, saw him just as quickly snuff it
out. 'the new act. mr electrico.'
'no! look at the old man! look!' will yelled. the police turned to appraise his demon cry.
'don't you see!' said will. 'he's dead! only thing holds him up is the straps!'
the internes gazed up at the great flake of winter flung into and held by the black chair.
oh gosh, thought will, we thought it would all be simple. the old man, mr cooger, dying, so
we bring doctors to save him, so he forgives us, maybe,

from the cold mouth and cold eyes locked up in frozen eyelids. inside the frozen nostrils not a
white hair stirred. mr cooger's ribs under his collapsed shirt were stone-rigid and his teeth
under his clay lips were dry-ice cold.put him out at noon and fog would steam off him.
the internes glanced at each other. they nodded.
the policemen, at this, took one step forward.
'gentlemen!'
mr dark scuttled a tarantula hand up an electric brass switchboard.
'one hundred thousand volts will now bum mr electrico's body!
'no don't let him! will cried.
the policemen took another step. the internes opened their mouths to speak. mr dark
flicked a swift demanding glance at jim. jim cried:
'no! it's all right!'
'jim!'
'will, yes, it's okay!'

immense fry, blast, the slam and sizzle of power which prowled in around over under about

will slapped his own hand to his mouth.

'i'm sorry…he whispered.

the freaks made a commotion of blinks and glares. what next from the statue in the cold
sizzling chair? the old old man's one eye gummed itself. the mouth collapsed, a bubble of
yellow mud in a sulphur bath.
the illustrated man banged the switch a notch grinning wildly at no one. he thrust a steel
sword in the old man's empty glove-like hand.

in the way.

then his mouth slit shut, his raw eye glued over. containing his cellar breath, he let the
simple sparks swarm his blood like dark champagne.

started talking and laughing,retelling everything that happened to one another, so will and jim
wound up lying, giving wrong names again, saying they lived around the comer from the police
station.
they let the police drop them at two dark houses near the station and they ran up on those
porches and grabbed the doorknobs and waited for the prowl car to swing off around the
corner into the station, and then they came down and followed and stood looking at the yellow
lights of the station all sun-coloured at midnight and will glanced over and saw the whole
evening come and go in jim's face and jim watching the police station windows as if at any
moment darkness might fill every room and put the lights out forever.

world of sidewalks that invited the one-thousand-yard dash, and the high hurdles of the dark

'no, no,' his father said, quickly.

'that's all right. go on.'

will sprang up, grabbed the first, the second, the third rungs and looked down.
from just this distance, dad looked as if he were shrinking, there on the ground.somehow
he didn't want to leave him behind there in the night, like someone ditched by someone else,
one hand up to move, but not moving.

will sensed a stir in jim's house; jim, too, with his fine dark antennae, must have felt the
waters part high over town to let a leviathan pass.
both boys felt a shadow bulk the drive between their houses, both flung up their windows,
both poked their heads out, both dropped their jaws in surprise at this friendly, this always
exquisite timing, this delightful pantomime of intuition, of apprehension, their tandem teamwork
over the years. then silver-faced, for the moon was rising, both glanced up.

jim slid the long slender clothesline pole over, will fixed it on his sill, then swung out, hand
over hand, swung until jim pulled him through his window and they barefooted it into jim's
clothes closet and boosted and hoisted each other up inside the attic that smelled like lumber
mills, old, dark, and too silent.perched out on the high roof, shivering, will cried: 'jim, there it is.'
and there it was, in the moonlight.
it was a track like a snail paints on a sidewalk. it glistened it was silver-slick.but this was a
path left by a gigantic snail that, if it existed at all, weighed a hundred pounds. the silver ribbon
was a yard across.starting down at the leaf-flued rain trough, the silver track shimmered to
the rooftop, then tremored down the other side.

there was the swift shush of his feet in the leaves and the big shush of the creature in the
sky, while moonlight snowed everything and stars glittered.
he pulled up in front of the redman house, a torch in each lung, tasting blood, crying out
silently: here! this is my house!
he felt a great river change its bed in the sky. good! he thought.
his hand turned the doorknob of the old house. oh god, he thought, what if they are inside,
waiting for me?
he opened a door on darkness.
dust came and went in that dark, and a harpstring gesticulation of spiders. nothing else.
will jumped two at a time up the crumbling stairs, around and out on the roof where he
stashed his weapons behind the chimney and stood tall.
the balloon, green as slime, printed with titan pictures of winged scorpions, ancient
phoenixes, smokes, fires, clouded weathers, swung its wicker basket wheezing, down.

at dawn, a juggernaut of thunder wheeled over the stony heavens in a spark-throwing
tumult. rain fell softly on town cupolas, chuckled from rainspouts, and spoke in strange
subterranean tongues beneath the windows where jim and will knew fitful dreams, slipping
out of one, trying another for size, but finding all cut from the same dark, mouldered cloth.
in the rustling drumbeat, a second thing occurred:
from the sodden carnival grounds, the carousel suddenly spasmed to life. its calliope fluted
up malodorous steams of music.
perhaps only one person in town heard and guessed that the carousel was working again.
the door to miss foley's house opened and shut; her footsteps hurried away along the
street.
then the rain fell hard as lightning did a crippled dance down the now-totally-revealed, now-
vanishing-forever land.

'no, no, don't!' screamed jim, he thrashed, he broke free fell, leaped to his feet, one fist raised
to strike. he stopped, trembling, held it to his side. 'oh, will, will, let's get out of here, i'm sorry,
oh god, god.'
the little girl in the shadow of the tree, flung back, widened her eyes to fix the two in
wetness, moaned, clutched herself and rocked back and forth, her own child-baby, comforting
her elbows… soon she might sing to herself and sing that way, alone beneath the dark tree,
forever, no one able to join or stop the song.
'…someone must help me…someone must help her…' she mourned as for one dead,
'someone must help her…nobody will…nobody has…help her if not me…terrible…terrible…'
'she knows us!' said will, hopelessly, half bent down to her, half turned to jim. 'i can't leave
her!'
'lies!' said jim, wildly. 'lies! she don't know us! never saw her before!'

he had a crazy wish to grab the gum and stuff it back up into the little boy's mouth.

jim and will glanced at each other.

the small boy stuck one hand half through the grille.
above, in the street, mr dark, the illustrated man, glanced back over his river of freaks, cages,
at the sunburst tubas and python brass horns. he nodded.
the parade fell apart.
the freaks hurried half to one sidewalk, half to the other, mingling with the crowd, passing
out handbills, eyes fire-crystal, quick, striking like snakes.
the small boy's shadow cooled will's cheek.

the dwarf stopped and looked at the boy no bigger than himself. their eyes met.

eyes of all his beasts and hapless creatures cutting through his shirt, coat, trousers, fastening

his two palms near. ‘but? - '

he's not that old! cried will to himself, blinking up at the three, as the witch stopped, her
shadow falling moist-frog cool on the hidden boys.
'…old man… '
mr halloway was jolted as by a series of cold knives thrust in his stomach.
'…old man…old man…' said the witch.
she stopped this. 'ah…' the hairs in her nostrils bristled.
she gaped her mouth to savour air. 'ah…'
the illustrated man quickened.

'now, this is a fine cigar!' yelled will's father, turning with great pomp back to the counter.
'quiet…' said the illustrated man.
the boys looked up.
'now - ' the witch sniffed the wind.
'got to light it again!' mr halloway stuck the cigar in the eternal blue flame.
'silence…' suggested mr dark.
'ever smoke, yourself?' asked dad.
the witch, from the concussion of his fiercely erupted and overly jovial words, dropped one
wounded hand to her side, wiped sweat from it, as one wipes an antenna for better reception,
and drifted it up again, her nostrils flared with wind.
'ah!' will's father blew a dense cloud of cigar smoke. it made a fine thick cumulus surrounding
the woman.
'gah!' she choked.
'fool!' the illustrated man barked, but whether at man or woman, the boys below could not
tell.

'here, let's buy you one!' mr halloway blew more smoke, handing mr dark a cigar.
the witch exploded a sneeze,recoiled, staggered away. the illustrated man snatched
dad's arm, saw that he had gone too far, let go, and could only follow his gypsy woman off, in
some clumsy and totally unexpected defeat.but then in going, he heard will's father say, 'a
fine day to you, sir!'
no, dad! thought will.
the illustrated man came back.

and will, below, gazing up, eyes wet, mouth wide, thought, oh my gosh, why didn't i see it
before?
dad's tall. dad's very tall indeed.
still charles halloway did not look down at the grille but only at the small comets of splashed
red colour left on the sidewalk, trailed around the corner, dropped from the clenched hands of
the vanished mr dark. he was also gazing with surprise at himself, accepting the surprise, the
new purpose, which was half despair, half serenity, now that the incredible deed was done. let
no one ask why he had given his true name; even he could not assay and give its real weight.
now he could only read the numerals on the courthouse clock and speak to it, while the boys
below, listened.
'oh, jim, will, something is going on. can you hide, keep out from under, the rest of the day?

lattice-grille, he peered down in the pit.
below lay yellow newspapers, wilted candy wrappers, burnt cigars, and gum.
mr dark's cry was muffled fury.

mr tetley blinked over his counter.

books. now and then he hurried off to peer into the autumn night, watchful of the streets.

the huge clock squinting at the yellowed pages as if they were moth-wings pinned dead to the
wood.

if it were a once friendly fort that might now be manned by arabs.
'so here we are,' whispered jim, and stopped.
'why am i whispering? it's after hours. heck!'
he laughed, then stopped.
for he thought he heard a soft tread off in the subterranean vaults.
but it was only his laughter walking back through the deep stacks on panther feet.
so when they talked again, it was still in whispers. deep forests, dark caves, dim churches,
half-lit libraries were all the same, they tuned you down, they dampened your ardour, they
brought you to murmurs and soft cries for fear of raising up phantom twins of your voice which
might haunt corridors long after your passage.
they reached the small room and circled the table on which charles halloway had laid out
the books, where he had read many hours, and for the first time looked in each other's faces
and saw a dreadful paleness, so did not comment.

from, where's it going, what's it up to? we thought it never hit town before.yet, by god, look

he tapped a yellowed newspaper ad dated october 12, 1888, and ran his fingernail along
under this:

'j.c. g.m.' said jim. 'those are the same initials as on the throwaways around town this

he laid forth other old newspapers.

‘would they?’ mr. dark let his smile melt like a white and pink paraffin candy toy he no longer
had appetite for.softly, he said, ‘i could kill you.’
charles halloway nodded, walking slowly.

‘jim!’ he said. ‘will! what were you doing up there, boys? surely not reading?’
‘dad!’
‘mr. halloway!’
will's father stepped from the dark.
the illustrated man rearranged the boys tenderly under one arm like kindling, then gazed
with genteel curiosity at charles halloway and reached for him. will's father struck one blow
before his left hand was seized, held, squeezed.as the boys watched, shouting, they saw
charles halloway gasp and fall to one knee.
mr. dark squeezed that left hand harder and, doing this, slowly, certainly, pressured the boys
with his other arm, crushing their ribs so air gushed from their mouths.
night spiraled

will's father, groaning, sank to both knees, flailing his right arm.
‘damn you!’
‘but,’ said the carnival owner quietly, ‘i am already.’
‘damn you, damn you!’
‘not words, old man,’ said mr. dark. ‘not words in books or words you say, but real thoughts,
real actions, quick thought, quick action, win the day.so!’
he gave one last mighty clench of his fist.
the boys heard charles halloway's finger bones crack. he gave a last cry and fell senseless.
in one motion like a solemn pavane, the illustrated man rounded the stacks, the boys, kicking
books from shelves, under his arms.

both boys were dropped suddenly.before they could move or regain their breath, each was
gripped by the hair on their head and roused marionettes-wise to face a window, a street.
‘boys, you read dickens?’ mr. dark whispered.

happenstance flakes off him like fleas from a killed ox. look!’
both boys writhed in the iron-maiden clutch of hungry saurians and bristly apes.
will did not know whether to weep with joy or new despair.
below, across the avenue, passing from church going home, was his mother and jim's
mother.

mouth..
‘mom,’ crooned mr. dark, mockingly. ‘come save me!’
no, thought will, save yourself,run!
but his mother and jim's mother simply strolled content, from the warm church through
town.
mom! screamed will again, and some small muffled bleat of it escaped the sweaty paw.
will's mother, a thousand miles away over on that side-walk, paused.
she couldn't have heard! thought will.yet -
she looked over at the library.
‘good,’ sighed mr. dark. ‘excellent, fine.’

his mother's gaze trailed from the front entrance to the first-floor windows.
‘here,’ said mr. dark. ‘second floor.a proper coincidence, let's make it proper.’
now jim's mother was talking.both women stood together at the curb.
no, thought will, oh, no.
and the women turned and went away into the sunday-night town.
will felt the illustrated man slump the tiniest bit.
‘not much of a coincidence, no crisis, no one lost or saved.pity. well!’
dragging the boys' feet, he glided down to open the front door.
someone waited in the shadows.
a lizard hand scurried cold on will's chin.

cold sand funneled will's ears, burying her voice. muffled, far away, fading, she chanted on
with a rustle, tick, tickle, tap, flourish of caliper hands.
moss grew in jim's ears, swiftly sealing him deep.
‘darning needle-dragonfly, sew up these eyes so they not see!’
her white-hot fingerprints rolled back their stricken eyeballs to throw the lids down with
bangs like great tin doors slammed shut.
will saw a billion flashbulbs explode, then suck to darkness while the unseen darning-needle
insect out beyond somewhere pranced and fizzed like insect drawn to sun-warmed honeypot,
as closeted voice stitched off their senses forever and a day beyond.
‘darning-needle dragonfly, have done with eye, ear, lip and tooth, finish hem, sew dark,

the witch, somewhere outside the boys, lowered her hands.

the woman from the dust sniffed at her twin triumphs,ran her hand a last loving time over
her statues.
the dwarf toddled madly about in the boys' shadows, nibbling daintily at their fingernails,
softly calling their names.
the illustrated man nodded toward the library. ‘the janitor's clock.stop it.’
the witch, mouth wide, savoring doom, wandered off into the marble quarry.
mr. dark said: ‘left,right. one, two.’
the boys walked down the steps, the dwarf at jim's side, the skeleton at will's.
serene as death, the illustrated man followed.

somewhere near, charles halloway's hand lay in a white-hot furnace, melted to sheer nerve
and pain. he opened his eyes.at the same moment he heard a great breath as the front door
swung shut and a woman's voice came singing in the hall:
‘old man, old man, old man, old man…?’

the small parade moved, soundless, past the eternally revolving, ending-but-unending
candy serpentine of mr. crosetti's barber pole, past all the darkening or darkened shops, the
emptying streets, for people were home now from the church suppers, or out at the carnival for
the last side show or the last high-ladder diver floating like milkweed down the night.

whorl-symbolled the dust.
and yet farther back came the janitor-father, now slowing himself with remembrances of
age, now pacing swiftly young with thoughts of the brief first encounter and victory, carrying
his left hand patted to his chest, chewing medicines as he went.
at the midway rim, mr. dark looked back as if an inner voice had named the stragglers in his
widely separated maneuver.but the voice failed, he was unsure. he nodded briskly, and dwarf,
skeleton, jim, will thrust through the crowd.
jim felt the river of bright people wash by all around but not touching. will heard waterfall

and crowd of boys, plus crowd of reflected mr. dark's illustrations, for he had taken off his
coat and shirt now, crammed and crushed through to the waxworks at the end of the maze.
‘sit,’ said mr. dark. ‘stay.’
among the wax figures of murdered, gunshot, guillotined, garroted men and women the two
boys sat like egyptian cats, unblinked, untwitched, unswallowing.
some late visitors passed through, laughing. they commented on all the wax figures.
they did not notice the thin line of saliva crept from the comer of one ‘wax’ boy's mouth.
they did not see how bright was the second ‘wax’ boy's stare, which suddenly brimmed and
ran clear water down his cheek.

‘ladies and gentlemen!’
the last crowd of the night, three or four hundred strong, turned as a body.
the illustrated man, stripped to the waist, all nightmare viper, sabertooth, libidinous ape,
clotted vulture, all salmon-sulphur sky rose up with annunciations:
‘the last free event this evening! come one! come all!’
the crowd surged toward the main platform outside the freak tent, where stood dwarf,
skeleton, and mr. dark.
‘the most amazingly dangerous, ofttimes fatal - world famous bullet trick!’
the crowd gasped with pleasure.
‘the rifles, if you please!’
the thin one cracked wide a racked display of bright artillery.
the witch, hurrying up, froze when mr. dark cried: 'and here, our death-defier, the bulletcatcher
who will stake her life - mademoiselle tarot!’
the witch shook her head, bleated, but dark's hand swept down to swing her like a child to
the platform, still protesting, which gave dark pau

‘a volunteer, please, to fire the rifle!’
the crowd rumbled softly, daring itself to speak up.
mr. dark's mouth barely moved. under his breath he asked, ‘is the clock stopped?’
‘not,’ she whined, ‘stopped.’
‘no?’ he almost burst out.
he burnt her with his eyes, then turned to the audience and let his mouth finish the spiel, his
fingers rapping over the rifles.
‘volunteers, please!’

mr. dark nodded swiftly.
‘since there are no volunteers -‘ he scraped his illustrated wrist. the witch shuddered. ‘we
will cancel our last act and - ‘
‘here! a volunteer!’
the crowd turned.
mr. dark recoiled., then asked: ‘where?’
‘here.’
far out at the edge of the crowd, a hand lifted, a path opened.
mr. dark could see very clearly the man standing there, alone.
charles halloway, citizen, father, introspective husband, night-wanderer, and janitor of the
town library.

the crowd's appreciative clamor faded.
charles halloway did not move.
he let the path grow leading down to the platform.
he could not see the expression on the faces of the freaks standing up there. his eyes

‘coming!’ he shouted.
‘go get 'em,pop!’ a man said.
‘yes,’ said charles halloway. ‘i will.’
and he walked down through the crowd.
the witch spun slowly, magnetized at the night-wandering volunteer's approach. her
eyelids jerked at their sewn black-wax threads behind dark glasses.
mr. dark, the illustration-drenched, superinfested civilization of souls, leaned from the
platform, gladly whetting his lips. thoughts spun fiery catherine wheels in his eyes, quick, quick,
what, what, what!
and the aging janitor, fixing a smile to his face like a white celluloid set of teeth from a
cracker jack box, strode on, and the crowd opened as the sea before moses and closed
behind, and him wondering what to do? why was he here? but on the move, steadily,
nevertheless.

the witch trembled secretly.
mr. dark felt this secret, glanced sharply.swiftly he put his hand out to grab for the good
right hand of this fifty-four-year-old man.
but the fifty-four-year-old man shook his head, would not give his hand to be held, touched,
or helped up.
‘thanks, no.’
on the platform, charles halloway waved to the crowd.
the people set off a few firecrackers of applause.
‘but -’ mr. dark was amazed - ‘your left hand, sir, you can't hold and fire a rifle if you have only
the use of one hand!’
charles halloway paled.
‘i'll do it,’ he said. ‘with one hand.’
‘hoorah!’ cried a boy, below.
‘go it, charlie!’ a man called, out beyond.
mr. dark flushed as the crowd laughed and applauded even louder now. he lifted his hands
to ward off the wave of refreshing sound, like rain that washed in from the people.
‘all right, all right! let's see if he can do it!’

the audience hooted, said things against mr. dark's bad manners which made him turn
away for a moment, damning himself, silently.
will's father lifted the rifle, beaming.
the crowd roared.
and while the wave of applause came in, crashed, and went back down the shore, he looked
again to the maze, where the sensed but unseen shadow-shapes of will and jim were filed
among titanic razor blades of revelation and illusion, then back to the medusa gaze of mr. dark,
swiftly reckoned with, and on to the stitched and jittering sightless nun of midnight,

to the whorled red-black rifle bull's-eye target.

mr. dark stiffened.
‘i need a boy volunteer to help me hold the rifle!’ shouted charles halloway.
‘someone! anyone!’ he shouted.
a few boys in the crowd shifted around on their toes.
‘boy!’ shouted charles halloway. ‘hold on. my son's out there. he'll volunteer, won't you, will?’
the witch flung one band up to feel the shape of this audacity which came off the fifty-fouryear-old
man like a fever. mr. dark was spun round as if hit by a fast-traveling gunshot.

he seemed to be waiting, just as was will's father.

will sat in the wax museum.
mr. dark smiled.

and handing the rifle down like a cane for the boy to grasp, his father drew him up onto the
stand.
‘here's my good left hand!’ announced the father.
will neither saw nor heard the crowd sound forth a solid and offensive applause.
mr. dark had not moved, though charles halloway could see him, during all this, lighting and
setting off cannon crackers in his head; but each, one by one, fizzled and died. mr. dark could
not guess what they were up to. for that matter, charles halloway did not know or guess. it
was as if he had written this play for himself, over the years, in the library, nights, torn up the
play after memorizing it, and now forgotten what he had set forth to remember. he was relying

the illustrated man looked left, found no pleasure in the skeleton, who simply looked thinner;
found no pleasure looking right to a dwarf who blandly dwelt in squashed idiot madness.
‘the bullet, please!’ will's father said, amiably.
the thousand illustrations on his jerking horseflesh frame did not hear, so why should mr.

‘if you please,’ said charles halloway. ‘the bullet? so i may knock that flea off the old
gypsy's wart!’
will stood motionless.
mr. dark hesitated.
out in the choppy sea, smiles flashed, here, there, a hundred, two hundred, three hundred
whitenesses, as if a vast titillation of water had been provoked by a lunar gravity. the tide
ebbed.
the illustrated man, in slow motion, proffered the bullet. his arm, a long molasses undulation,
lazed to offer the bullet to the boy, to see if he would notice; he did not notice.
his father took the missile.
‘mark it with your initials,’ said mr. dark, by rote.

mr. dark saw a crescent moon on the bullet, saw nothing wrong with such a moon,rammed it
in the rifle, slapped the rifle back at will's father, who once more caught it deftly.
‘ready, will?’
the boy's peach face drowsed in the slightest nod.
charles halloway flicked a last glance at the maze, thought, jim, you there still? get ready!
mr. dark turned to go pat, conjure, calm his dust-crone friend, but cracked to a halt at the
crack of the rifle being reopened, the bullet ejected by will's father, to

the illustrated man, glancing up, saw charles halloway with the opened rifle, the wax bullet.
but instead of revealing what he knew, mr. halloway simply said, ‘let's cut our mark more
clearly, eh, boy?’ and with his penknife, the boy holding the bullet in his senseless hand, he
marked this fresh new wax unmarked bullet with the same mysterious crescent moon, then
snapped it back into the rifle.
‘ready?!’
mr. dark looked to the witch.
who hesitated, then nodded, once, faintly.
‘ready!’ announced charles halloway.
and all about lay the tents, the breathing crowds, the anxious freaks, a witch iced with
hysteria, jim hidden to be found, an ancient mummy still seated glowing with blue fire in his
electric chair, and a merry-go-round waiting for the show to cease, the crowd to go, and the
carnival to have its way with boys and janitor trapped if possible, and alone.

quickly the fifty-four-year-old janitor, denying each year, laid the rifle back on the boy's
jerking shoulder.

and the boy grew very calm indeed, with the rifle on his shoulder, and mr. dark squeezed
tight on the peach-fuzz face nestled in the flesh of his hand, but the boy was serene in the
laughter which still flowed and his father kept the hoop rolling thus:

screaming about.
‘she's fainted -’
‘no.she slipped!’
‘she’s… shot!’
at last charles halloway came to stand by the illustrated man, looking down. there were
many things in his face: surprise, dismay, and some small strange relief and satisfaction.
the woman was lifted and put on the platform. her mouth was frozen open, almost with a
look of recognition.
he knew she was dead. in a moment, the crowd would know. he watched the il

around, out of one nightmare and fresh into the next as his father stood with him and mr. dark
cried: ‘everyone home! show's over! lights! lights!’
the carnival lights flickered.
the crowd, herded before the failing illumination, turned like a great carousel and as the
lamps dimmed, hustled toward the few remaining pools of light as if to warm themselves there
before braving the wind. one by one, one by one, the lights indeed were going off.

whistling, simpering, and the crowd, like a shake of leaves from one huge tree, blew off the

‘no!’
charles halloway struck the match from his son's hand. ‘dad, don't.’
for in the new dark, the restive herd of old men shambled forward, hearts hammering.
‘dad, we gotta see!’
he struck his second and final match.
and in the flare saw dad sunk down, eyes clenched, fists tight, and all those other men who
would have to shunt, crawl, scramble on knees once this last light was gone. will grabbed his
father's shoulder and shook him.
‘oh, dad, dad, i don't care how old you are, ever! i don't care what, i don't care anything! oh,

they stared at the open door through which jim had run to be lost in the swarms of night

the last electric light bulb went out.
‘we’ll never find him now,’ said will.
‘yes,’ said his father, standing in the dark. ‘we'll find him.’
where? will thought, and stopped.
far down the midway, the carousel steamed, the calliope tortured itself with musics.
there, thought will. if jim's anywhere, it’s there, to the music, old funny jim, the free-ride
ticket hid in his pocket still, i bet! oh, damn jim, damn him, damn him! he cried, and then
thought, no! don’t you, he's damned already, or near it! so how do we find him in the dark, no

but his father said ‘there,’ very softly. with gratitude.
and will stepped to the door, which was lighter now.

it was rising from the hills.
‘the police…?’
‘no time. it's the next few minutes or nothing. three people we got to worry about -’
‘the freaks!’
‘three people, will. number one, jim, number two, mr. cooger frying in his electric chair.
number three, mr. dark and his skinful of souls.save one, kick the other two to hell and gone.
then i think the freaks go, too.you ready, will?’
will eyed the door, the tents, the dark, the sky with new light paling it.
‘god bless the moon.’
hands tight together, they stepped out the door.
as if to greet them, the wind flung up and down all the tent canvases in a great prehistoric
thunder-kite display of leprous wings.

‘which way?’ dad whispered.
‘through here!’ will pointed.
a hundred yards off, beyond a foothill of tents, there was a flare of blue light, sparks jumped
up and fell away, then dark again.
mr.electrico! thought will. they're trying to move him, sure! get him to the merry-go-round,
kill or cure! and if they cure him, then, oh gosh, then, it's angry him and angry illustrated man
against just dad and me! and jim? well, where was jim? this way one day, that way the next,
and… tonight? whose side would he wind up on? ours! old friend jim! ours, of course! but

round, and handsome sum?

‘the freaks - why don't they stop us?’
‘scared.’
‘of us?!’
will's father crouched and squinted out from around an empty cage.
‘they're walking wounded, anyway. they saw what happened to the witch. that's the only
answer. look at them.’
and there they stood, like uprights, like tent poles spotted all through the meadow grounds,
hiding in shadow, waiting. for what? will swallowed, hard. maybe not hiding at all, but spread
out for the running fight to come.at the right time, mr. dark would yell and they'd just circle in.
but the time wasn't right. mr. dark was busy. when he'd done what must be done, then he'd
give that yell.so? so, thought will, we got to see he never yells at all.
will's feet slithered in the grass.
will's father moved ahead.
the freaks watched with moon-glass eyes as they passed.
the calliope changed. it whistled sadly, sweetly, around a curve of tents, around a riverflow
of darkness.
it's going ahead! thought will.yes! it was going backward.but now it st

‘jim!’ will burst out.
‘sh!’ dad shook him.
but the name had tumbled from his mouth only because he heard the calliope summing the
golden years ahead, felt jim isolate somewhere, pulled by warm gravities, swung by sunrise
notes, wondering what it could be like to stand sixteen, seventeen, eighteen years tall, and
then, oh then, nineteen and, most incredible! -twenty! the great wind of time blew in the brass

toward the music that grew up like a peach tree full of sun-ripe fruit -
no! he thought.
and instead made his feet step to his own fear, jump to his own tune, a hum cramped back
by throat, held fast by lungs, which shook the bones of his head and drowned the calliope
away.
‘there,’ said dad softly.
and between the tents, ahead, in transit, they saw a grotesque parade. like a dark sultan in
a palanquin, a half-familiar figure rode a chair borne on the shoulders of assorted sizes and
shapes of darkness.
at dad's cry, the parade jolted, then broke into a run!
‘mr.electrico!’ said will.
they're taking him to the carousel!
the parade vanished.
a tent lay between them.

on such excursions, only, in panic, to cease activity because the merest jolt, the slightest
breath, threatened to shake old ancient cooger down to mealmush and chaff? better to leave
him propped in electric-warm chair, a continual exhibit, an ever-going-on performance for
gaping audiences, and try again, but especially try now, when, lights out, and crowds herded off
in the dark, all threatened by one smile on a bullet, there was need of cooger as he once was,
tall, flame-headed, and riven with earthquake violence.but somewhere, twenty seconds, ten
seconds ago, the last glue crumbled, the last bolt of life fell free, and the mummy-doll, the
erector-set grotesque disencumbered itself in smoke puffs and november leaflets, a broadcast
of mortality along the wind. mr. cooger, threshed in a final harvest, was now a billion parchment

no, not something.someone.
will flexed his eyes.
the carousel, deserted, empty, traveled on its way through its own special time, forward.
but between the fallen chair and the carousel, standing alone, was that a freak? no…
‘jim!’
dad knocked his elbow and will shut up.
jim, he thought.
and where, now, was mr. dark?
somewhere. for he had started the carousel, hadn't he? yes! to draw them, to draw jim,
and - what else? right now there was no time, for -
jim turned from the spilled chair, turned and walk slowly toward the free, free ride.
he was going where he had always known he must go.
like a weather vane in wild seasons he had tremored this way, wandered that, hesitated
upon bright horizons and warm directions, only at last now to tilt and, half sleep-walking,
tremble about in the bright brass pull and

jim opened his mouth with the same cry:
‘eeeeeeeeeeeeee!’
‘jim!’ cried will,running.
jim's palm slapped one brass pole. the pole whipped on.
he slapped another brass pole. this time, his palm glued itself tight.
wrist followed fingers, arm followed wrist, shoulder and body followed arm. jim, sleepwalked,
was torn from his roots in the earth.
‘jim!’
will reached, felt jim's foot flick from his grasp.
jim swung round the waiting night in a great dark summer circle, will racing after.
‘jim, get off! jim, don't leave me here!’
flung by centrifuge, jim grasped the pole with one hand, spun, and, as if by some lone lost
and final instinct, gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind, the one part of him, the
small white separate part that still remembered their friendship.
‘jim, jump!!’
will snatched for that hand, missed, stumbled, almost fell. the first race was lost. jim must

all of will rode with friend jim now.
‘jim! dad!’
how easy it might be to just stand,ride, go round with jim, if he couldn't pull jim off, just
leave him on and, dear pals, travel! the juices of his body swam, binding his sight, they
drummed his ears, shot electric jolts through his loins…
jim shouted. will shouted.
they traveled half a year in slithering orchard-warm dark before will seized jim's arm tight
and dared to leap from so much promise, so many fine tall-growing years, flail out, off, down,
pull jim with.but jim could not let go the pole, could not give up the ride.
‘will!’
jim, half between machine and friend, one hand on each, screamed.
it was like a great tearing of cloth or flesh.
jim's eyes went blind as a statue's.
the carousel whirled.
jim screamed, fell, spun crazily, on the air.

they looked up.
a boy came running down the midway bumping into the ticket booths, falling over tent ropes,
looking back over his shoulder.
‘help! he's after me!’ the boy cried. ‘the terrible man! the terrible man! i want to go home!’
the boy flung himself forward, and grabbed at will's father.
‘oh, help, i'm lost, i don't like it. take me home. that man with the tattoos!’
‘mr. dark!’ gasped will.
‘yes!’ gibbered the boy. ‘he's down that way! oh, stop him!’
‘will -’ his father rose - ‘take care of jim.artificial respiration.all right, boy.’
the boy trotted off. ‘this way!’
following, charles halloway watched the distraught boy who led him; observed his head, his
frame, the way his pelvis hung from his spine.
‘boy,’ he said, by the shadowed merry-go-round, twenty feet around from where will bent to
jim. ‘what's your name?’
‘no time!’ cried

‘you can't hurt me!’ the boy shrieked.

he pressed the boy, almost lovingly, close, very close.

‘i'm not going to murder you, jed, mr. dark, whoever, whatever you are.you're going to

somewhere, the skeleton moved out in the light.somewhere else, the dwarf almost knew who
he was, and scuttled forth like a crab from a cave to blink and blink again at will bent working
over jim, at will's father bent to exhaustion over the still form of the silent boy, while the merrygo-round,
at last, slow, slow, came to a stop,rocking like a ferryboat in the watery-blowing
grass.
the carnival was a great dark hearth lit with gathered coals, as shadows came to stare and
fire their gaze with the tableau by the carousel.
there in the moonlight lay the, illustrated boy named dark.
there lay dragons slaughtered, towers ruined, monsters from dim ages toppled into rusted
coinages pterodactyls smashed like biplanes from old and always meaningless wars, crustacea

bones.
more freaks, with faces the color of beds where so many had lost the battle of souls,
emerged from the shadows to glide in a great and ever more curious carousel motion about
charles halloway and his dropped burden.

now there lay just a plain dead boy, unbruised by pictures, staring up at the stars with mr.
dark's empty eyes.
‘ahhhh…’
in a chorus of release, the strange people in the shadows sighed.
perhaps the calliope gave a last ringmaster's bark.perhaps thunder turned, sleeping, in the
clouds.suddenly all wheeled about. the freaks stampeded. north, south, east, west, free of
tent, master, dark law, free above all of each other, they ran like albino pigs, tuskless boars, and
stricken sloths before storms.
it must have been, it seemed, each yanked a rope, loosed a tent-peg,running.
for now the sky was shaken with a fatal respiration, the breathing down, the insunk rattle
and pule of collapsing darkness as the tents gave way.
with hiss of viper, swirl of cobra, the ropes insanely raveled, slithered, snapped, cut grass
with frictioned whips.

then at last, the freak tent, the great melancholy mothering reptile bird, after a moment of
indecision, sucked in a niagara of blizzard air, broke loose three hundred hempen snakes,
crack-rattled its black sidepoles so they fell like teeth from a cyclopean jaw, slammed the air

each read the thoughts in the other's eyes.
how easy, thought will.
just this once, thought jim.
but then, thought charles halloway, once you start, you'd always come back. one more ride
and one more ride.and, after awhile, you'd offer rides to friends, and more friends until finally…
the thought hit them all in the same quiet moment.
… finally you wind up owner of the carousel, keeper of the freaks… proprietor for some small
part of eternity of the traveling dark carnival shows…
maybe, said their eyes, they're already here.
charles halloway stepped back into the machinery of the merry-go-round, found a wrench,
and knocked the flywheels and cogs to pieces. then he took the boys out and he hit the
control box one or two times until it broke and scattered fitful lightnings.

the freaks to give it power.but -’ he hit the box a last time and threw down the wr

he did just that.
and lord! it was fine printing their life in the dew on the cool fields that new dark suddenlylike-christmas
morning. the boys ran as tandem ponies, knowing that someday one would
touch base first, and the other second or not at all, but now this first minute of the new
morning was not the minute or the day or morning of ultimate loss. now was not the time to
study faces to see if one was older and the other too much younger. today was just another
day in october in a year suddenly better than anyone supposed it could ever be just a short
hour ago, with the moon and the stars mo
