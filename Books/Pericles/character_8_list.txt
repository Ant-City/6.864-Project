Dionyza - 
      
        Wife of Cleon, Dionyza too pledges to care for Pericles's child, but falls prey to jealousy and envy when her own daughter is less praised than Pericles's. Hence she makes a plot to have Marina killed. Cleon is stunned by Dionyza's cruelty, yet they are both punished in the end.
