grown beard upon his cheeks, which was
rather of a yellow or amber hue. one part of his dress only remains, but
it is too remarkable to be suppressed; it was a brass ring, resembling a
dog’s collar, but without any opening, and soldered fast round his neck,
so loose as to form no impediment to his breathing, yet so tight as to
be incapable of being removed, excepting by the use of the file. on this
singular gorget was engraved, in saxon characters, an inscription of the
following purport:--“gurth, the son of beowulph, is the born thrall of
cedric of rotherwood.”

beside the swine-herd, for such was gurth’s occupation, was seated, upon
one of the fallen druidical monuments, a person about ten years younger
in appearance, and whose dress, though resembling his companion’s in
form, was of better materials, and of a more fantastic appearance. his
jacket had been stained of a bright purple hue, upon which there had
been some attempt to paint grotesque ornaments in different colours. to

 after blowing his horn obstreperously, to collect together
the scattered herd of swine, which, answering his call with notes
equally melodious, made, however, no haste to remove themselves from the
luxurious banquet of beech-mast and acorns on which they had fattened,
or to forsake the marshy banks of the rivulet, where several of them,
half plunged in mud, lay stretched at their ease, altogether regardless
of the voice of their keeper. “the curse of st withold upon them and
upon me!” said gurth; “if the two-legged wolf snap not up some of them
ere nightfall, i am no true man. here, fangs! fangs!” he ejaculated at
the top of his voice to a ragged wolfish-looking dog, a sort of lurcher,
half mastiff, half greyhound, which ran limping about as if with the
purpose of seconding his master in collecting the refractory grunters;
but which, in fact, from misapprehension of the swine-herd’s signals,
ignorance of his own duty, or malice prepense, only drove them hither
and thither, and in

creased the evil which he seemed to design to remedy.
“a devil draw the teeth of him,” said gurth, “and the mother of mischief

and makes them unfit for their trade! [8] wamba, up and help me an thou
be’st a man; take a turn round the back o’ the hill to gain the wind

to carry my gay garments through these sloughs, would be an act of
unfriendship to my sovereign person and royal wardrobe; wherefore,
gurth, i advise thee to call off fangs, and leave the herd to their
destiny, which, whether they meet with bands of travelling soldiers,
or of outlaws, or of wandering pilgrims, can be little else than to
be converted into normans before morning, to thy no small ease and
comfort.”

“the swine turned normans to my comfort!” quoth gurth; “expound that
to me, wamba, for my brain is too dull, and my mind too vexed, to read
riddles.”

“why, how call you those grunting brutes running about on their four
legs?” demanded wamba.

“swine, fool, swine,” said the herd, “every fool knows that.”

“and swine is good saxon,” said the jester; “but how call you the sow
when she is flayed, and drawn, and quartered, and hung up by the heels,
like a traitor?”

“pork,” answered the swine-herd.

“i am very glad every

fool knows that too,” said wamba, “and pork, i
think, is good norman-french; and so when the brute lives, and is in
the charge of a saxon slave, she goes by her saxon name; but becomes a
norman, and is called pork, when she is carried to the castle-hall to
feast among the nobles; what dost thou think of this, friend gurth, ha?”

“it is but too true doctrine, friend wamba, however it got into thy
fool’s pate.”

“nay, i can tell you more,” said wamba, in the same tone; “there is old
alderman ox continues to hold his saxon epithet, while he is under the
charge of serfs and bondsmen such as thou, but becomes beef, a fiery
french gallant, when he arrives before the worshipful jaws that are
destined to consume him. mynheer calf, too, becomes monsieur de veau

“by st dunstan,” answered gurth, “thou speakest but sad truths; little
is left to us but the air we breathe, and that appears to have been
reserved with much hesitation, solely for the purpose of enabling us to
endure the tasks they lay upon our shoulders. the finest and the fattest
is for their board; the loveliest is for their couch; the best and
bravest supply their foreign masters with soldiers, and whiten distant

 he exclaimed again, raising his voice, “so ho! so ho! well done, fangs!

“gurth,” said the jester, “i know thou thinkest me a fool, or thou

spoken treason against the norman,--and thou art but a cast-away
swineherd,--thou wouldst waver on one of these trees as a terror to all
evil speakers against dignities.”

“dog, thou wouldst not betray me,” said gurth, “after having led me on
to speak so much at disadvantage?”

“betray th

man; a fool cannot half so well help himself--but soft, whom have we

became then audible.

“never mind whom,” answered gurth, who had now got his herd before him,
and, with the aid of fangs, was driving them down one of the long dim
vistas which we have endeavoured to describe.

“nay, but i must see the riders,” answered wamba; “perhaps they are come
from fairy-land with a message from king oberon.”

“a murrain take thee,” rejoined the swine-herd; “wilt thou talk of such
things, while a terrible storm of thunder and lightning is raging within
a few miles of us? hark, how the thunder rumbles! and for sum

“a truce to thine insolence, fellow,” said the armed rider, breaking in
on his prattle with a high and stern voice, “and tell us, if thou canst,
the road to--how call’d you your franklin, prior aymer?”

“cedric,” answered the prior; “cedric the saxon.--tell me, good fellow,
are we near his dwelling, and can you show us the road?”

“the road will be uneasy to find,” answered gurth, who broke silence for
the first time, “and the family of cedric retire early to rest.”

“tush, tell not me, fellow,” said the military rider; “‘tis easy for
them to arise and supply the wants of travellers such as we are, who
will not stoop to beg the hospitality which we have a right to command.”

“i know not,” said gurth, sullenly, “if i should show the way to my
master’s house, to those who demand as a right, the shelter which most
are fain to ask as a favour.”

“d

o you dispute with me, slave!” said the soldier; and, setting spurs
to his horse, he caused him make a demivolte across the path, raising at
the same time the riding rod which he held in his hand, with a purpose
of chastising what he considered as the insolence of the peasant.

gurth darted at him a savage and revengeful scowl, and with a fierce,
yet hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife; but the
interference of prior aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion
and the swineherd, prevented the meditated violence.

“nay, by st mary, brother brian, you must not think you are now in
palestine, predominating over heathen turks and infidel saracens; we
islanders love not blows, save those of holy church, who chasteneth whom

till you come to a sunken cross, of which scarce a cubit’s length
remains above ground; then take the path to the left, for there are
four which meet at sunken cross, and i trust your reverences will obtain
shelter before the storm comes on.”

the abbot thanked his sage adviser; and the cavalcade, setting spurs to
their horses, rode on as men do who wish to reach their inn before the
bursting of a night-storm. as their horses’ hoofs died away, gurth
said to his companion, “if they follow thy wise direction, the reverend
fathers will hardly reach rotherwood this night.”

“no,” said the jester, grinning, “but they may reach sheffield if they
have good luck, and that is as fit a place for them. i am not so bad a
woodsman as to show the dog where the deer lies, if i have no mind he
should chase him.”

“thou art right,” said gurth; “it were ill that aymer saw the lady

materials richly embroidered, which completed the dress of the opulent
landholder when he chose to go forth. a short boar-spear, with a broad
and bright steel head, also reclined against the back of his chair,
which served him, when he walked abroad, for the purposes of a staff or
of a weapon, as chance might require.

several domestics, whose dress held various proportions betwixt the
richness of their master’s, and the coarse and simple attire of gurth
the swine-herd, watched the looks and waited the commands of the saxon
dignitary. two or three servants of a superior order stood behind their
master upon the dais; the rest occupied the lower part of the hall.
other attendants there were of a different description; two or three
large and shaggy greyhounds, such as were then employed in hunting the
stag and wolf; as many slow-hounds of a large bony breed, with thick
necks, large heads, and long ears; and one or two of the smaller dogs,

repelled by the stern command, “down, balder, down! i am not in the
humour for foolery.”

in fact, cedric, as we have observed, was in no very placid state of
mind. the lady rowena, who had been absent to attend an evening mass at
a distant church, had but just returned, and was changing her garments,
which had been wetted by the storm. there were as yet no tidings of
gurth and his charge, which should long since have been driven home from
the forest and such was the insecurity of the period, as to render it
probable that the delay might be explained by some depreciation of the
outlaws, with whom the adjacent forest abounded, or by the violence
of some neighbouring baron, whose consciousness of strength made
him equally negligent of the laws of property. the matter was of
consequence, for great part of the domestic wealth of the saxon
proprietors consisted in nume

this undeniable argument produced a sort of acquiescent umph! on the
part of the saxon, with the addition, “i wish her devotion may choose
fair weather for the next visit to st john’s kirk;--but what, in the
name of ten devils,” continued he, turning to the cupbearer, and raising
his voice as if happy to have found a channel into which he might divert
his indignation without fear or control--“what, in the name of ten
devils, keeps gurth so long afield? i suppose we shall have an evil
account of the herd; he was wont to be a faithful and cautious drudge,
and i had destined him for something better; perchance i might even have
made him one of my warders.” [11]

oswald the cupbearer modestly suggested, “that it was scarce an hour
since the tolling of the curfew;” an ill-chosen apology, since it turned
upon a topic so harsh to saxon ears.

“the foul fiend,” exclaimed cedric, “take the curfew-bell, and the

that my property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry
banditti, whom they cannot support but by theft and robbery. my faithful
slave is murdered, and my goods are taken for a prey--and wamba--where
is wamba? said not some one he had gone forth with gurth?”

oswald replied in the affirmative.

“ay? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the saxon
fool, to serve the norman lord. fools are we all indeed that serve them,
and fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were born
with but half our wits. but i will be avenged,” he added, starting from
his chair in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold of his
boar-spear; “i will go with my complaint to the great council; i have

 the speaker one of those hasty and impatient glances,
which comparisons between the two rival nations seldom failed to call
forth; but, recollecting the duties of hospitality, he suppressed
further show of resentment, and, motioning with his hand, caused his
guests to assume two seats a little lower than his own, but placed close
beside him, and gave a signal that the evening meal should be placed
upon the board.

while the attendants hastened to obey cedric’s commands, his eye
distinguished gurth the swineherd, who, with his companion wamba, had
just entered the hall. “send these loitering knaves up hither,” said the
saxon, impatiently. and when the culprits came before the dais,--“how
comes it, villains! that you have loitered abroad so late as this? hast
thou brought home thy charge, sirrah gurth, or hast thou left them to
robbers and marauders?”

“the herd is safe, so please ye,” said gurth.

“but it does not please me, thou knave,” said cedric, “that i should be

against my neighbours for wrongs they have not done me. i tell thee,

gurth, knowing his master’s irritable temper, attempted no exculpation;
but the jester, who could presume upon cedric’s tolerance, by virtue
of his privileges as a fool, replied for them both; “in troth, uncle
cedric, you are neither wise nor reasonable to-night.”

“‘how, sir?” said his master; “you shall to the porter’s lodge, and

“certainly not, fool,” answered cedric.

“then why should you shackle poor gurth, uncle, for the fault of his dog

got our herd together, which fangs did not manage until we heard the
vesper-bell.”

“then hang up fangs,” said cedric, turning hastily towards the
swineherd, “if the fault is his, and get thee another dog.”

“under favour, uncle,” said the jester, “that were still somewhat on the
bow-hand of fair justice; for it was no fault of fangs that he was lame

the saxon, kindling in wrath.

“marry, that did old hubert,” said wamba, “sir philip de malvoisin’s

he chased the deer contrary to his master’s right, as warden of the
walk.”

“the foul fiend take malvoisin,” answered the saxon, “and his keeper
both! i will teach them that the wood was disforested in terms of
the great forest charter. but enough of this. go to, knave, go to thy
place--and thou, gurth, get thee another dog, and should the keeper dare
to touch it, i will mar his archery; the curse of a coward on my head,
if i strike not off the forefinger of his right hand!--he shall draw
bowstring no more.--i crave your pardon, my worthy guests. i am beset

oswald, returning, whispered into the ear of his master, “it is a jew,
who calls himself isaac of york; is it fit i should marshall him into
the hall?”

“let gurth do thine office, oswald,” said wamba with his usual
effrontery; “the swineherd will be a fit usher to the jew.”

admitted into this presence!”

“a dog jew,” echoed the templar, “to approach a defender of the holy

inheritance better than they do their company.”

ceremony to an exterior and ignoble part of the building, where a number
of small apartments, or rather cells, served for sleeping places to the
lower order of domestics, and to strangers of mean degree.

“in which of these sleeps the jew?” said the pilgrim.

“the unbelieving dog,” answered anwold, “kennels in the cell next your
holiness.--st dunstan, how it must be scraped and cleansed ere it be
again fit for a christian!”

“and where sleeps gurth the swineherd?” said the stranger.

“gurth,” replied the bondsman, “sleeps in the cell on your right, as the
jew on that to your left; you serve to keep the child of circumcision
separate from the abomination of his tribe. you might have occupied a
more honourable place had you accepted of oswald’s invitation.”

“it is as well as it is,” said the palmer; “the company, even of a jew,
can hardly spread contamination through an oaken partition.”

us gird up our loins--let us flee!--here is thy staff, why wilt thou
tarry?”

“i tarry not,” said the pilgrim, giving way to the urgency of his
companion; “but i must secure the means of leaving this place--follow
me.”

he led the way to the adjoining cell, which, as the reader is apprised,
was occupied by gurth the swineherd.--“arise, gurth,” said the pilgrim,
“arise quickly. undo the postern gate, and let out the jew and me.”

gurth, whose occupation, though now held so mean, gave him as much
consequence in saxon england as that of eumaeus in ithaca, was offended
at the familiar and commanding tone assumed by the palmer. “the jew
leaving rotherwood,” said he, raising himself on his elbow, and looking
superciliously at him without quitting his pallet, “and travelling in
company with the

“i should as soon have dreamt,” said wamba, who entered the apartment at
the instant, “of his stealing away with a gammon of bacon.”

“nevertheless,” said gurth, again laying down his head on the wooden log
which served him for a pillow, “both jew and gentile must be content to
abide the opening of the great gate--we suffer no visitors to depart by
stealth at these unseasonable hours.”

“nevertheless,” said the pilgrim, in a commanding tone, “you will not, i
think, refuse me that favour.”

so saying, he stooped over the bed of the recumbent swineherd, and
whispered something in his ear in saxon. gurth started up as if
electrified. the pilgr

im, raising his finger in an attitude as if to
express caution, added, “gurth, beware--thou are wont to be prudent. i
say, undo the postern--thou shalt know more anon.”

with hasty alacrity gurth obeyed him, while wamba and the jew followed,
both wondering at the sudden change in the swineherd’s demeanour. “my
mule, my mule!” said the jew, as soon as they stood without the postern.

“fetch him his mule,” said the pilgrim; “and, hearest thou,--let me have
another, that i may bear him company till he is beyond these parts--i
will return it safely to some of cedric’s train at ashby. and do
thou”--he whispered the rest in gurth’s ear.

“willingly, most willingly shall it

 be done,” said gurth, and instantly
departed to execute the commission.

“i wish i knew,” said wamba, when his comrade’s back was turned, “what
you palmers learn in the holy land.”

“to say our orisons, fool,” answered the pilgrim, “to repent our sins,
and to mortify ourselves with fastings, vigils, and long prayers.”

“something more potent than that,” answered the jester; “for when would
repentance or prayer make gurth do a courtesy, or fasting or vigil
persuade him to lend you a mule?--i trow you might as well have told his
favourite black boar of thy vigils and penance, and wouldst have gotten
as civil an answer.”

“go to,” said the pilgrim, “thou art but a saxon fool.”

“thou sayst well,” said the jester; “had i been born a norman, as i
think thou art, i would have had luck on my side, and been next door to
a wise man.”

at this moment gurth appeared on the opposite side of the moat with

le
a small bag of blue buckram, which he took from under his cloak,
containing, as he muttered, “a change of raiment--only a change of
raiment.” then getting upon the animal with more alacrity and haste
than could have been anticipated from his years, he lost no time in so
disposing of the skirts of his gabardine as to conceal completely from
observation the burden which he had thus deposited “en croupe”.

the pilgrim mounted with more deliberation, reaching, as he departed,
his hand to gurth, who kissed it with the utmost possible veneration.
the swineherd stood gazing after the travellers until they were lost
under the boughs of the forest path, when he was disturbed from his
reverie by the voice of wamba.

“knowest thou,” said the jester, “my good friend gurth, that thou art
strangely courteous and most unwontedly pious on this summer morning? i
would i were a black prior or a barefoot palmer, to avail myself of thy
unwonted zeal and courtesy--certes, i would make more out

of it than a
kiss of the hand.”

“thou art no fool thus far, wamba,” answered gurth, “though thou arguest
from appearances, and the wisest of us can do no more--but it is time to
look after my charge.”

so saying, he turned back to the mansion, attended by the jester.

meanwhile the travellers continued to press on their journey with a
dispatch which argued the extremity of the jew’s fears, since persons at
his age are seldom fond of rapid motion. the palmer, to whom every path
and outlet in the wood appeared to be familiar, led the way through the
most devious paths, an

“you have spoken well, good squire,” said the disinherited knight,
“well and boldly, as it beseemeth him to speak who answers for an absent
master. leave not, however, the horse and armour here. restore them to
thy master; or, if he scorns to accept them, retain them, good friend,
for thine own use. so far as they are mine, i bestow them upon you
freely.”

baldwin made a deep obeisance, and retired with his companions; and the
disinherited knight entered the pavilion.

“thus far, gurth,” said he, addressing his attendant, “the reputation of
english chivalry hath not suffered in my hands.”

“and i,” said gurth, “for a saxon swineherd, have not ill played the
personage of a norman squire-at-arms.”

“yea, but,” answered the disinherited knight, “thou hast ever kept me in
anxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee.”

“tush!” said gurth, “i fear discovery from none, saving my playfellow,

“enough,” said the disinherited knight, “thou knowest my promise.”

“nay, for that matter,” said gurth, “i will never fail my friend for
fear of my skin-cutting. i have a tough hide, that will bear knife or
scourge as well as any boar’s hide in my herd.”

“trust me, i will requite the risk you run for my love, gurth,” said the
knight. “meanwhile, i pray you to accept these ten pieces of gold.”

“i am richer,” said gurth, putting them into his pouch, “than ever was
swineherd or bondsman.”

“take this bag of gold to ashby,” continued his master, “and find out

with which his credit supplied me.”

“nay, by st dunstan,” replied gurth, “that i will not do.”

“how, knave,” replied his master, “wilt thou not obey my commands?”

“so they be honest, reasonable, and christian commands,” replied gurth;
“but this is none of these. to suffer the jew to pay himself would be
dishonest, for it would be cheating my master; and unreasonable, for it
were the part of a fool; and unchristian, since it would be plundering a
believer to enrich an infidel.”

“see him contented, however, thou stubborn varlet,” said the
disinherited knight.

the apartment; “and it will go hard,” he muttered, “but i content him

untasted glass of greek wine which he had just raised to his lips, and
saying hastily to his daughter, “rebecca, veil thyself,” commanded the
stranger to be admitted.

just as rebecca had dropped over her fine features a screen of silver
gauze which reached to her feet, the door opened, and gurth entered,
wrapt in the ample folds of his norman mantle. his appearance was rather
suspicious than prepossessing, especially as, instead of doffing his
bonnet, he pulled it still deeper over his rugged brow.

“art thou isaac the jew of york?” said gurth, in saxon.

“i am,” replied isaac, in the same language, (for his traffic had
rendered every tongue spoken in britain familiar to him)--“and who art
thou?”

“that is not to the purpose,” answered gurth.

think, care very greatly by whose hands it is delivered.”

“i said he was a good youth!” exclaimed isaac with joyful exultation. “a

swineherd a richer drought than gurth had ever before tasted. “and how
much money,” continued isaac, “has thou brought with thee?”

“holy virgin!” said gurth, setting down the cup, “what nectar these
unbelieving dogs drink, while true christians are fain to quaff ale as
muddy and thick as the draff we give to hogs!--what money have i
brought with me?” continued the saxon, when he had finished this uncivil
ejaculation, “even but a small sum; something in hand the whilst. what,

christians here could buy so many horses and armour--no jew except
myself would give him half the values. but thou hast a hundred zecchins
with thee in that bag,” said isaac, prying under gurth’s cloak, “it is a
heavy one.”

“i have heads for cross-bow bolts in it,” said gurth, readily.

“well, then”--said isaac, panting and hesitating between habitual love
of gain and a new-born desire to be liberal in the present instance, “if
i should say that i would take eighty zecchins for the good steed and
the rich armour, which leaves me not a guilder’s profit, have you money
to pay me?”

“barely,” said gurth, though the sum demanded was more reasonable than

if such be your least offer, i must be content.”

“fill thyself another goblet of wine,” said the jew. “ah! eighty
zecchins is too little. it leaveth no profit for the usages of the
moneys; and, besides, the good horse may have suffered wrong in this
day’s encounter. o, it was a hard and a dangerous meeting! man and steed
rushing on each other like wild bulls of bashan! the horse cannot but
have had wrong.”

“and i say,” replied gurth, “he is sound, wind and limb; and you may
see him now, in your stable. and i say, over and above, that seventy
zecchins is enough for the armour, and i hope a christian’s word is as
good as a jew’s. if you will not take seventy, i will carry this bag”
 (and he shook it till the contents jingled) “back to my master.”

“nay, nay!” said isaac; “lay down the talents--the shekels--the eighty
zecchins, and thou shalt see i will consider thee liberally.”

gurth at length complied;

 generosity urged him to restore some part at
least to his benefactor, or as a donation to his agent. his whole speech
ran nearly thus:

“seventy-one--seventy-two; thy master is a good youth--seventy-three,
an excellent youth--seventy-four--that piece hath been clipt
within the ring--seventy-five--and that looketh light of
weight--seventy-six--when thy master wants money, let him come to isaac
of york--seventy-seven--that is, with reasonable security.” here he made
a considerable pause, and gurth had good hope that the last three pieces
might escape the fate of their comrades; but the enumeration
proceeded.--“seventy-eight--thou art a good fellow--seventy-nine--and
deservest something for thyself---”

here the jew paused again, and looked at the last zecchin, intending,
doubtless, to bestow it upon gurth. he weighed it upon the tip of his
finger, and made it ring by dropping it upon the table. had it rung too
flat, or had it felt a hair’s breadth too light, generosity had carried

the day; but, unhappily for gurth, the chime was full and true, the
zecchin plump, newly coined, and a grain above weight. isaac could not
find in his heart to part with it, so dropt it into his purse as if in
absence of mind, with the words, “eighty completes the tale, and i trust
thy master will reward thee handsomely.--surely,” he added, looking
earnestly at the bag, “thou hast more coins in that pouch?”

gurth grinned, which was his nearest approach to a laugh, as he replied,
“about the same quantity which thou hast just told over so carefully.”
 he then folded the quittance, and put it under his cap, adding,--“peril
of thy beard, jew, see that this be full and ample!” he filled himself
unbidden, a third goblet of wine, and left the apartment without
ceremony.

“rebecca,” said the jew, “that ishmaelite hath gone somewhat beyond me.
nevertheless his master is a good youth--ay, and i am w

as he turned to receive rebecca’s answer, he observed, that during his
chattering with gurth, she had left the apartment unperceived.

in the meanwhile, gurth had descended the stair, and, having reached the
dark antechamber or hall, was puzzling about to discover the entrance,
when a figure in white, shown by a small silver lamp which she held in
her hand, beckoned him into a side apartment. gurth had some reluctance
to obey the summons. rough and impetuous as a wild boar, where only
earthly force was to be apprehended, he had all the characteristic
terrors of a saxon respecting fawns, forest-fiends, white women, and
the whole of the superstitions w

she asked him the particulars of his transaction with isaac, which he
detailed accurately.

“my father did but jest with thee, good fellow,” said rebecca; “he owes
thy master deeper kindness than these arms and steed could pay, were
their value tenfold. what sum didst thou pay my father even now?”

“eighty zecchins,” said gurth, surprised at the question.

“in this purse,” said rebecca, “thou wilt find a hundred. restore to
thy master that which is his due, and enrich thyself with the remainder.

ded israelite, obeyed her summons,
with a torch in his hand; undid the outward door of the house, and
conducting gurth across a paved court, let him out through a wicket in
the entrance-gate, which he closed behind him with such bolts and chains
as would well have become that of a prison.

“by st dunstan,” said gurth, as he stumbled up the dark avenue, “this

gurth, will redeem thy bondage, and make thee a brother as free of thy

     --two gentlemen of verona

the nocturnal adventures of gurth were not yet concluded; indeed he
himself became partly of that mind, when, after passing one or two
straggling houses which stood in the outskirts of the village, he found
himself in a deep lane, running between two banks overgrown with hazel
and holly, while here and there a dwarf oak flung its arms altogether
across the path. the lane was moreover much rutted and broken up by the
carriages which had recently transported articles of various kinds to
the tournament; and it was dark, for the ba

from the village were heard the distant sounds of revelry, mixed
occasionally with loud laughter, sometimes broken by screams, and
sometimes by wild strains of distant music. all these sounds, intimating
the disorderly state of the town, crowded with military nobles and
their dissolute attendants, gave gurth some uneasiness. “the jewess was
right,” he said to himself. “by heaven and st dunstan, i would i were
safe at my journey’s end with all this treasure! here are such numbers,
i will not say of arrant thieves, but of errant knights and errant
squires, errant monks and errant minstrels, errant jugglers and errant
jesters, that a man with a single merk would be in danger, much more a
poor swineherd with a whole bagful of zecchins. would i were out of
the shade of these infernal bushes, tha

t i might at least see any of st
nicholas’s clerks before they spring on my shoulders.”

gurth accordingly hastened his pace, in order to gain the open common
to which the lane led, but was not so fortunate as to accomplish his
object. just as he had attained the upper end of the lane, where the
underwood was thickest, four men sprung upon him, even as his fears
anticipated, two from each side of the road, and seized him so fast,
that resistance, if at first practicable, would have been now too
late.--“surrender your charge,” said one of them; “we are the deliverers
of the commonwe

alth, who ease every man of his burden.”

“you should not ease me of mine so lightly,” muttered gurth, whose
surly honesty could not be tamed even by the pressure of immediate
violence,--“had i it but in my power to give three strokes in its
defence.”

“we shall see that presently,” said the robber; and, speaking to his
companions, he added, “bring along the knave. i see he would have his
head broken, as well as his purse cut, and so be let blood in two veins
at once.”

gurth was hurried along agreeably to this mandate, and having been
dragged somewhat roughly over the bank, on the left-hand side of the
lane, found himself in a straggling thicket, which lay betwixt it and
the open common. he was compelled to follow his rough conductors into
the very depth of this cover, where they stopt unexpectedly in an
irregular open space, free in a great measure from trees, and on which,
therefore, the beams of the moon fell without much interruption from
boughs and leaves. her

e his captors were joined by two other persons,
apparently belonging to the gang. they had short swords by their sides,
and quarter-staves in their hands, and gurth could now observe that
all six wore visors, which rendered their occupation a matter of no
question, even had their former proceedings left it in doubt.

“what money hast thou, churl?” said one of the thieves.

“thirty zecchins of my own property,” answered gurth, doggedly.

“a forfeit--a forfeit,” shouted the robbers; “a saxon hath thirty
zecchins, and returns sober from a village! an undeniable and
unredeemable forfeit of all he hath about him.”

“i hoarded it to purchase my freedom,” said gurth.

“thou art an ass,” replied one of the thieves “three quarts of double
ale had rendered thee as free as thy master, ay, and freer too, if he be
a saxon like thyself.”

“a sad truth,” replied gurth; “but if these same thirty zecchins

will
buy my freedom from you, unloose my hands, and i will pay them to you.”

“hold,” said one who seemed to exercise some authority over the others;
“this bag which thou bearest, as i can feel through thy cloak, contains
more coin than thou hast told us of.”

“it is the good knight my master’s,” answered gurth, “of which,
assuredly, i would not have spoken a word, had you been satisfied with
working your will upon mine own property.”

“thou art an honest fellow,” replied the robber, “i warrant thee; and we
worship not st nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirty zecchins may yet
escape, if thou deal uprightly with us. meantime render up thy trust
for a time.” so saying, he took from gurth’s breast the large leathern
pouch, in which the purse given him by rebecca was enclosed, as well as

 
 ___________________________
 
the rest of the zecchins, and then continued his interrogation.--“who is
thy master?”

“the disinherited knight,” said gurth.

“whose good lance,” replied the robber, “won the prize in to-day’s
tourney? what is his name and lineage?”

“it is his pleasure,” answered gurth, “that they be concealed; and from
me, assuredly, you will learn nought of them.”

“what is thine own name and lineage?”

“to tell that,” said gurth, “might reveal my master’s.”

“thou art a saucy groom,” said the robber, “but of that anon. how comes
thy master by this gold? is it of his inheritance, or by what means hath
it accrued to him?”

“by his good lance,” answered gurth.--“these bags contain the ransom of
four good horses, and four good suits of armour.”

“how much is there?” demanded the robber.

“two hundred zecchins.”

“only two hundred zecchins!” said the bandit; “your master hath dealt
libera

lly by the vanquished, and put them to a cheap ransom. name those
who paid the gold.”

gurth did so.

“the armour and horse of the templar brian de bois-guilbert, at what
ransom were they held?--thou seest thou canst not deceive me.”

“my master,” replied gurth, “will take nought from the templar save
his life’s-blood. they are on terms of mortal defiance, and cannot hold
courteous intercourse together.”

“indeed!”--repeated the robber, and paused after he had said the
word. “and what wert thou now doing at ashby with such a charge in thy
custody?”

“i went thither to render to isaac the jew of york,” replied gurth,
“the price of a suit of armour with which he fitted my master for this
tournament.”

“and how much didst thou pay
 
 ___________________________
 
 to isaac?--methinks, to judge by weight,
there is still two hundred zecchins in this pouch.”

“i paid to isaac,” said the saxon, “eighty zecchins, and he restored me
a hundred in lieu thereof.”

“how! what!” exclaimed all the robbers at once; “darest thou trifle with
us, that thou tellest such improbable lies?”

“what i tell you,” said gurth, “is as true as the moon is in heaven. you
will find the just sum in a silken purse within the leathern pouch, and
separate from the rest of the gold.”

“bethink thee, man,” said the captain, “thou speakest of a jew--of an
israelite,--as unapt to restore gold, as the dry sand of his deserts to
return the cup of water which the pilgrim spills upon them.”

“there is no more mercy in them,” said another of the banditti, “than in
an unbribed sheriffs officer.”

“it is, however

, as i say,” said gurth.

“strike a light instantly,” said the captain; “i will examine this said
purse; and if it be as this fellow says, the jew’s bounty is little
less miraculous than the stream which relieved his fathers in the
wilderness.”

a light was procured accordingly, and the robber proceeded to examine
the purse. the others crowded around him, and even two who had hold of
gurth relaxed their grasp while they stretched their necks to see the
issue of the search. availing himself of their negligence, by a sudden
exertion of strength and activity, gurth shook himself free of their
hold, and might have escaped, could he have resolved to leave his
master’s property behind him. but such was no part of his intention.
he wrenched a quarter-staff from one of the fellows, struck down the
captain, who was altogether unaware of his purpose, and had well-nigh
repossessed himself

 of the pouch and treasure. the thieves, however,
were too nimble for him, and again secured both the bag and the trusty
gurth.

“knave!” said the captain, getting up, “thou hast broken my head;
and with other men of our sort thou wouldst fare the worse for thy
insolence. but thou shalt know thy fate instantly. first let us speak of
thy master; the knight’s matters must go before the squire’s, according
to the due order of chivalry. stand thou fast in the meantime--if
thou stir again, thou shalt have that will make thee quiet for thy
life--comrades!” he then said, addressing his gang, “this purse is

ert, whom we have so much reason to fear? and were all
this otherwise, wouldst thou have us show a worse conscience than an
unbeliever, a hebrew jew?”

“nay, that were a shame,” muttered the other fellow; “and yet, when i
served in the band of stout old gandelyn, we had no such scruples of
conscience. and this insolent peasant,--he too, i warrant me, is to be
dismissed scatheless?”

“not if thou canst scathe him,” replied the captain.--“here, fellow,”
 continued he, addressing gurth, “canst thou use the staff, that thou
starts to it so readily?”

“i think,” said gurth, “thou shouldst be best able to reply to that
question.”

“nay, by my troth, thou gavest me a round knock,” replied the captain;
“do as much for this fellow, and thou shalt pass scot-free; and if thou
dost not--why, by my faith, as thou art such a sturdy knave, i think
i must pay thy ransom myself.--take thy staff, miller,” he added, “and
keep thy head; and do you others let the fellow g

the open space, in order to have the full benefit of
the moonlight; the thieves in the meantime laughing, and crying to their
comrade, “miller! beware thy toll-dish.” the miller, on the other hand,
holding his quarter-staff by the middle, and making it flourish round
his head after the fashion which the french call “faire le moulinet”,
exclaimed boastfully, “come on, churl, an thou darest: thou shalt feel
the strength of a miller’s thumb!”

“if thou be’st a miller,” answered gurth, undauntedly, making his weapon
play around his head with equal dexterity, “thou art doubly a thief, and
i, as a true man, bid thee defiance.”

so saying, the two champions closed together, and for a few minutes they
displayed great equality in strength, courage, and skill, intercepting
and returning the blows of their adversary with the most rapid
dexterity, while, from the continued clatter of their weapons, a person
at a distance might have supposed that there were at least six persons

ngaged on each side. less obstinate, and even less dangerous combats,
have been described in good heroic verse; but that of gurth and the
miller must remain unsung, for want of a sacred poet to do justice to
its eventful progress. yet, though quarter-staff play be out of date,
what we can in prose we will do for these bold champions.

long they fought equally, until the miller began to lose temper at
finding himself so stoutly opposed, and at hearing the laughter of his
companions, who, as usual in such cases, enjoyed his vexation. this was
not a state of mind favourable to the noble game of quarter-staff, in
which, as in
 
 ___________________________
 
 ordinary cudgel-playing, the utmost coolness is requisite;
and it gave gurth, whose temper was steady, though surly, the
opportunity of acquiring a decided advantage, in availing himself of
which he displayed great mastery.

the miller pressed furiously forward, dealing blows with either end of
his weapon alternately, and striving to come to half-staff distance,
while gurth defended himself against the attack, keeping his hands about
a yard asunder, and covering himself by shifting his weapon with great
celerity, so as to protect his head and body. thus did he maintain
the defensive, making his eye, foot, and hand keep true time, until,
observing his antagonist to lose wind, he darted the staff at his face
with his left hand; and, as the miller endeavoured to parry the thrust,
he slid his right hand down to his left, and with the full swing of the
weapon struck hi

s opponent on the left side of the head, who instantly
measured his length upon the green sward.

“well and yeomanly done!” shouted the robbers; “fair play and old
england for ever! the saxon hath saved both his purse and his hide, and
the miller has met his match.”

“thou mayst go thy ways, my friend,” said the captain, addressing gurth,
in special confirmation of the general voice, “and i will cause two of
my comrades to guide thee by the best way to thy master’s pavilion, and
to guard thee from night-walkers that might have less tender consciences
than ours; for there is many one of them upon the amble in such a night
as this. take heed, however,” he added sternly; “remember thou hast
refused to tell thy name--ask not after ours, nor endeavour to discover
who or what we are; for, if thou makest such an attempt, thou 
 
 ___________________________
 
wilt come
by worse fortune than has yet befallen thee.”

gurth thanked the captain for his courtesy, and promised to attend to
his recommendation. two of the outlaws, taking up their quarter-staves,
and desiring gurth to follow close in the rear, walked roundly forward
along a by-path, which traversed the thicket and the broken ground
adjacent to it. on the very verge of the thicket two men spoke to his
conductors, and receiving an answer in a whisper, withdrew into the
wood, and suffered them to pass unmolested. this circumstance induced
gurth to believe both that the gang was strong in numbers, and that they
kept regular guards around their place of rendezvous.

when they arrived on the open heath, where g

here the thieves stopt.

“we go with you no farther,” said they; “it were not safe that we should
do so.--remember the warning you have received--keep secret what has
this night befallen you, and you will have no room to repent it--neglect
what is now told you, and the tower of london shall not protect you
against our revenge.”

“good night to you, kind sirs,” said gurth; “i shall remember your
orders, and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a safer and an
honester trade.”

thus they parted, the outlaws returning in the direction from whence
they had come, and gurth proceeding to the tent of his master, to whom,
notwithstanding the injunction he had received, he communicated the
whole adventures of the evening.

the disinherited knight was filled with astonishment, no less at the
generosity of rebecca, by which, however, he resolved he would not

rofit, than that of the robbers, to whose profession such a quality
seemed totally foreign. his course of reflections upon these singular
circumstances was, however, interrupted by the necessity for taking
repose, which the fatigue of the preceding day, and the propriety
of refreshing himself for the morrow’s encounter, rendered alike
indispensable.

the knight, therefore, stretched himself for repose upon a rich couch
with which the tent was provided; and the faithful gurth, extending
his hardy limbs upon a bear-skin which formed a sort of carpet to the
pavilion, laid himself across the opening of the tent, so that no one
could enter without awakening him.

it was in vain that cedric’s cupbearer looked around for his young
master--he saw the bloody spot on which he had lately sunk down, but
himself he saw no longer; it seemed as if the fairies had conveyed him
from the spot. perhaps oswald (for the saxons were very superstitious)
might have adopted some such hypothesis, to account for ivanhoe’s
disappearance, had he not suddenly cast his eye upon a person attired
like a squire, in whom he recognised the features of his fellow-servant
gurth. anxious concerning his master’s fate, and in despair at his
sudden disappearance, the translated swineherd was searching for him
everywhere, and had neglected, in doing so, the concealment on which
his own safety depended. oswald deemed it his duty to secure gurth, as a
fugitive of whose fate his master was to judge.

renewing his enquiries concerning the fate of ivanhoe, the only
information which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanders
was, that the knight had been raised with care

 by certain well-attired
grooms, and placed in a litter belonging to a lady among the spectators,
which had immediately transported him out of the press. oswald, on
receiving this intelligence, resolved to return to his master for
farther instructions, carrying along with him gurth, whom he considered
in some sort as a deserter from the service of cedric.

the saxon had been under very intense and agonizing apprehensions
concerning his son; for nature had asserted her rights, in spite of the
patriotic stoicism which laboured to disown her. but no sooner was he
informed that ivanhoe was in careful, and probably in friendly hands,
than the paternal anxiety which had been excited by the dubiety of his
fate, gave way anew to the feeling of injured pride and resentment, at

he went accordingly to the banquet, of which we have already mentioned
the principal events. immediately upon retiring from the castle, the
saxon thanes, with their attendants, took horse; and it was during the
bustle which attended their doing so, that cedric, for the first time,
cast his eyes upon the deserter gurth. the noble saxon had returned from
the banquet, as we have seen, in no very placid humour, and wanted but a
pretext for wreaking his anger upon some one.

“the gyves!” he said, “the gyves!--oswald--hundibert!--dogs and
villains!--why leave ye the knave unfettered?”

without daring to remonstrate, the companions of gurth bound him with
a halter, as the readiest cord which occurred. he submitted to the
operation without remonstrance, except that, darting a reproachful
look at his master,

helstane, upon whose memory the abbot’s good
ale (for burton was already famous for that genial liquor) had made a
favourable impression,--“in my mind we had better turn back, and abide
with the abbot until the afternoon. it is unlucky to travel where your
path is crossed by a monk, a hare, or a howling dog, until you have
eaten your next meal.”

“away!” said cedric, impatiently; “the day is already too short for
our journey. for the dog, i know it to be the cur of the runaway slave
gurth, a useless fugitive like its master.”

so saying, and rising at the same time in his stirrups, impatient at the
interruption of his journey, he launched his javelin at poor fangs--for
fangs it was, who, having traced his master thus far upon his stolen
expedition, had here lost him, and was now, in his uncouth way,
rejoicing at his reappearance. the javelin inflicted a wound upon the
animal’s shoulder, and narrowly missed pinning him to the earth; and
fangs fled howling from the presence of

 the enraged thane. gurth’s heart
swelled within him; for he felt this meditated slaughter of his faithful
adherent in a degree much deeper than the harsh treatment he had himself
received. having in vain attempted to raise his hand to his eyes,
he said to wamba, who, seeing his master’s ill humour had prudently
retreated to the rear, “i pray thee, do me the kindness to wipe my eyes
with the skirt of thy mantle; the dust offends me, and these bonds will
not let me help myself one way or another.”

wamba did him 
 
 ___________________________
 
the service he required, and they rode side by side for
some time, during which gurth maintained a moody silence. at length he
could repress his feelings no longer.

“friend wamba,” said he, “of all those who are fools enough to serve
cedric, thou alone hast dexterity enough to make thy folly acceptable to
him. go to him, therefore, and tell him that neither for love nor fear
will gurth serve him longer. he may strike the head from me--he may
scourge me--he may load me with irons--but henceforth he shall never
compel me either to love or to obey him. go to him, then, and tell him
that gurth the son of beowulph renounces his service.”

“assuredly,” said wamba, “fool as i am, i shall not do your fool’s
errand. cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and thou
knowest he does not always miss his mark.”

“i care not,” replied gurth, “how soon he makes a

evotion,) “i will never forgive him!”

“to my thinking now,” said the jester, who was frequently wont to act
as peace-maker in the family, “our master did not propose to hurt fangs,
but only to affright him. for, if you observed, he rose in his stirrups,
as thereby meaning to overcast the mark; and so he would have done,
but fangs happening to bound up at the very moment, received a scratch,
which i will be bound to heal with a penny’s breadth of tar.”

“if i thought so,” said gurth--“if i could but think so--but no--i saw
the javelin was well aimed--i heard it whizz through the air with all
the wrathful malevolence of him who cast it, and it quivered after it
had pitched in the ground, as if with regret for having missed its mark.
by the hog dear to st anthony, i renounce him!”

and the indignant swineherd resumed his sullen silence, which no efforts
of the jester could again induce him to break.

meanwhile cedric and athelstane, the leaders of the troop, conversed
to

avellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country, and were
about to plunge into its recesses, held dangerous at that time from the
number of outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to despair,
and who occupied the forests in such large bands as could easily bid
defiance to the feeble police of the period. from these rovers, however,
notwithstanding the lateness of the hour cedric and athelstane accounted
themselves secure, as they had in attendance ten servants, besides wamba
and gurth, whose aid could not be counted upon, the one being a jester
and the other a captive. it may be added, that in travelling thus late
through the forest, cedric and athelstane relied on their descent and
character, as well as their courage. the outlaws, whom the severity of
the forest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life,
were chiefly peasants and yeomen of saxon descent, and were generally
supposed to respect the persons and property of their countrymen.

as the travellers

 was pleased in the same
proportion, as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling
suitor, requested rebecca to ride by her side.

“it were not fit i should do so,” answered rebecca, with proud humility,
“where my society might be held a disgrace to my protectress.”

by this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved; for the single
word “outlaws” rendered every one sufficiently alert, and the approach
of twilight made the sound yet more impressive. amid the bustle, gurth
was taken from horseback, in the course of which removal he prevailed
upon the jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound. it was
so negligently refastened, perhaps intentionally, on the part of wamba,
that gurth found no difficulty in freeing his arms altogether from
bondage, and then, gliding into the thicket, he made his escape from the
party.

the bustle had been considerable, and it was some time before gurth was
missed; for, as he was to be placed for the rest of the journey

behind
a servant, every one supposed that some other of his companions had him
under his custody, and when it began to be whispered among them
that gurth had actually disappeared, they were under such immediate
expectation of an attack from the outlaws, that it was not held
convenient to pay much attention to the circumstance.

the path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow, as not to
admit, with any sort of convenience, above two riders abreast, and began
to descend into a dingle, traversed by a brook whose banks were broken,
swampy, and overgrown with dwarf willows. cedric and athelstane, who
were at the head of their retinue, saw t

sitated more than once whether he should not turn back and share the
captivity of a master to whom he was sincerely attached.

“i have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom,” he said to himself,
“but i wish any wise man would teach me what use to make of it now that
i have it.”

as he pronounced these words aloud, a voice very near him called out in
a low and cautious tone, “wamba!” and, at the same time, a dog, which he
recognised to be fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. “gurth!” answered
wamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately stood before
him.

“what is the matter?” said he eagerly; “what mean these cries, and that
clashing of swords?”

“only a trick of the times,” said wamba; “they are all prisoners.”

“who are prisoners?” exclaimed gurth, impatiently.

“my lord, and my lady, and athelstane, and hundibert, and oswald.”

“in the name of god!” said gurth, “how came they prisoners?--and to
whom?”

“our master was
 
 ___________________________
 
 too ready to fight,” said the jester; “and athelstane
was not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. and they are
prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. and they lie all tumbled
about on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to your
swine. and i would laugh at it,” said the honest jester, “if i could for
weeping.” and he shed tears of unfeigned sorrow.

gurth’s countenance kindled--“wamba,” he said, “thou hast a weapon,
and thy heart was ever stronger than thy brain,--we are only two--but a
sudden attack from men of resolution will do much--follow me!”

“whither?--and for what purpose?” said the jester.

“to rescue cedric.”

“but you have renounced his service but now,” said wamba.

“that,” said gurth, “was but while he was fortunate--follow me!”

as the jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his
appeara

“and i charge ye, on
peril of your lives, not to stir from the place where ye stand, until
i have returned. obey me, and it shall be the better for you and your
masters.--yet stay, i must render myself as like these men as possible.”

so saying he unbuckled his baldric with the bugle, took a feather from
his cap, and gave them to wamba; then drew a vizard from his pouch,
and, repeating his charges to them to stand fast, went to execute his
purposes of reconnoitring.

“shall we stand fast, gurth?” said wamba; “or shall we e’en give him
leg-bail? in my foolish mind, he had all the equipage of a thief too
much in readiness, to be himself a true man.”

“let him be the devil,” said gurth, “an he will. we can be no worse of
waiting his return. if he belong to that party, he must already have
given them the alarm, and it will avail nothing either to fight or fly.
besides, i have late experience, that errant thieves are not the worst
men in the world to have to deal with.”

“friend gurth,” he said, “i have mingled among yon men, and have learnt
to whom they belong, and whither they are bound. there is, i think,
no chance that they will proceed to any actual violence against their
prisoners. for three men to attempt them at this moment, were little
else than madness; for they are good men of war, and have, as such,
placed sentinels to give the alarm when any one approaches. but i

ights of englishmen. he shall
not want english hands to help him in this extremity. come then with me,
until i gather more aid.”

so saying, he walked through the wood at a great pace, followed by the
jester and the swineherd. it was not consistent with wamba’s humour to
travel long in silence.

“i think,” said he, looking at the baldric and bugle which he still
carried, “that i saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize, and that
not so long since as christmas.”

“and i,” said gurth, “could take it on my halidome, that i have heard
the voice of the good yeoman who won it, by night as well as by day, and
that the moon is not three days older since i did so.”

“mine honest friends,” replied the yeoman, “who, or what i am, is little
to the present purpose; should i free your master, you will have reason
to think me the best friend you have ever had in your lives. and whether
i am known by one name or another--or whether i can draw a bow as well

sunshine or by moonlight, are matters, which, as they do not concern
you, so neither need ye busy yourselves respecting them.”

“our heads are in the lion’s mouth,” said wamba, in a whisper to gurth,
“get them out how we can.”

“hush--be silent,” said gurth. “offend him not by thy folly, and i trust
sincerely that all will go well.”

     when autumn nights were long and drear,
     and forest walks were dark and dim,
     how sweetly on the pilgrim’s ear
     was wont to steal the hermit’s hymn

they promised implicit obedience, and departed with alacrity on
their different errands. in the meanwhile, their leader and his two
companions, who now looked upon him with great respect, as well as some
fear, pursued their way to the chapel of copmanhurst.

when they had reached the little moonlight glade, having in front the
reverend, though ruinous chapel, and the rude hermitage, so well
suited to ascetic devotion, wamba whispered to gurth, “if this be the
habitation of a thief, it makes good the old proverb, the nearer the
church the farther from god.--and by my coxcomb,” he added, “i think it
be even so--hearken but to the black sanctus which they are singing in
the hermitage!”

in fact the anchorite and his guest were performing, at the full extent
of their very powerful lungs, an old drinking song, of which this was
the burden:--

     “come, trowl the brown bowl to me,
     bully boy, bully boy,
     come, trowl th
 
 ___________________________
 
e brown bowl to me:
     ho! jolly jenkin, i spy a knave in drinking,
     come, trowl the brown bowl to me.”

“now, that is not ill sung,” said wamba, who had thrown in a few of his
own flourishes to help out the chorus. “but who, in the saint’s name,
ever expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a hermit’s
cell at midnight!”

“marry, that should i,” said gurth, “for the jolly clerk of copmanhurst
is a known man, and kills half the deer that are stolen in this walk.
men say that the keeper has complained to his official, and that he
will be stripped of his cowl and cope altogether, if he keeps not better
order.”

while they were thus speaking, locksley’s loud and repeated knocks had
at length disturbed the anchorite and his guest. “by my beads,” said the
hermit, stopping short in a grand flourish, “here come more benighted
guests. i would

esire to continue unknown. believe, however, that my word, when
pledged, is as inviolate as if i wore golden spurs.”

“i willingly believe it,” said the knight; “i have been accustomed
to study men’s countenances, and i can read in thine honesty and
resolution. i will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid
thee in setting at freedom these oppressed captives; which done, i trust
we shall part better acquainted, and well satisfied with each other.”

“so,” said wamba to gurth,--for the friar being now fully equipped, the
jester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard the
conclusion of the conversation,--“so we have got a new ally?--l trust
the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the
hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this locksley looks like a
born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.”

“hold thy peace, wamba,” said gurth; “it may all be as thou dost guess;
but were the horned devil to ris

mal letter of defiance,” answered the templar; “but, by
our lady of bethlehem, if it be not a foolish jest, it is the most
extraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a
baronial castle.”

“jest!” said front-de-boeuf, “i would gladly know who dares jest with me
in such a matter!--read it, sir brian.”

the templar accordingly read it as follows:--“i, wamba, the son of
witless, jester to a noble and free-born man, cedric of rotherwood,
called the saxon,--and i, gurth, the son of beowulph, the swineherd---”

“thou art mad,” said front-de-boeuf, interrupting the reader.

“by st luke, it is so set down,” answered the templar. then resuming his
task, he went on,--“i, gurth, the son of beowulph, swineherd unto the
said cedric, with the assistance of our allies and confederates, who
make common cause with us in this our feud, namely, the good knight,
called for the present ‘le noir faineant’, and the stout yeoman, robert
locksley, called cleave-th

keeping.--signed by us upon the eve of st withold’s day, under the great
trysting oak in the hart-hill walk, the above being written by a
holy man, clerk to god, our lady, and st dunstan, in the chapel of
copmanhurst.”

at the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the first place, a
rude sketch of a cock’s head and comb, with a legend expressing this
hieroglyphic to be the sign-manual of wamba, son of witless. under this
respectable emblem stood a cross, stated to be the mark of gurth, the
son of beowulph. then was written, in rough bold characters, the words,
“le noir faineant”. and, to conclude the whole, an arrow, neatly enough
drawn, was described as the mark of the yeoman locksley.

the knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then
gazed upon each other in silent amazement, as being utterly at a loss to
know what it could portend. de bracy was the first to break silence by
an uncontrollable fit of laughter, wherein he was joined, though with

this letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to
the messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had
brought.

the yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the
head-quarters of the allies, which were for the present established
under a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the
castle. here wamba and gurth, with their allies the black knight and
locksley, and the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to
their summons. around, and at a distance from them, were seen many a
bold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed
the ordinary nature of their occupation. more than two hundred had
already assembled, and others were fast coming in. those whom they
obeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather

the templar was now delivered.

reference was at first made to the chaplain for an exposition of its
contents.

“by the crook of st dunstan,” said that worthy ecclesiastic, “which hath
brought more sheep within the sheepfold than the crook of e’er another
saint in paradise, i swear that i cannot expound unto you this jargon,
which, whether it be french or arabic, is beyond my guess.”

he then gave the letter to gurth, who shook his head gruffly, and passed
it to wamba. the jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper
with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume
upon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter to
locksley.

“if the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, i
might know something of the matter,” said the brave yeoman; “but as the
matter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag that’s at
twelve miles distance

.”

“i must be clerk, then,” said the black knight; and taking the letter
from locksley, he first read it over to himself, and then explained the
meaning in saxon to his confederates.

“execute the noble cedric!” exclaimed wamba; “by the rood, thou must be
mistaken, sir knight.”

“not i, my worthy friend,” replied the knight, “i have explained the
words as they are here set down.”

“then, by st thomas of canterbury,” replied gurth, “we will have the
castle, should we tear it down with our hands!”

“we have nothing else to tear it with,” replied wamba; “but mine are
scarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar.”

“‘tis but a contrivance to gain time,” said locksley; “they dare not do
a deed for which i could exact a fearful penalty.”

“i would,” said the black knight, “there were some one among us who
could obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case stands

be found qualified to administer both worldly and ghostly comfort to our

“hath he sense enough, thinkst thou?” said the black knight, addressing
gurth.

“i know not,” said gurth; “but if he hath not, it will be the first time
he hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account.”

“on with the frock, then, good fellow,” quoth the knight, “and let thy
master send us an account of their situation within the castle. their

sudden and bold attack. time wears--away with thee.”

looking to the jester.

“prospect, indeed!” echoed wamba; “let me tell you, when you fill my
cloak, you are wrapped in a general’s cassock. five hundred men are
there without, and i was this morning one of the chief leaders. my
fool’s cap was a casque, and my bauble a truncheon. well, we shall see
what good they will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man. truly, i

farewell, master, and be kind to poor gurth and his dog fangs; and let
my cockscomb hang in the hall at rotherwood, in memory that i flung away
my life for my master, like a faithful---fool.”

the last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest
and earnest. the tears stood in cedric’s eyes.

“thy memory shall be preserved,” he said, “while fidelity and affection
have honour upon earth! but that i trust i shall find the means of

of coningsburgh had left prince john’s lodging in high displeasure, and
were about to set forth on their return homeward.”

“went any lady with them to the banquet?” said wilfred.

“the lady rowena,” said rebecca, answering the question with more
precision than it had been asked--“the lady rowena went not to the
prince’s feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her
journey back to rotherwood, with her guardian cedric. and touching your
faithful squire gurth---”

“ha!” exclaimed the knight, “knowest thou his name?--but thou dost,” he
immediately added, “and well thou mayst, for it was from thy hand, and,
as i am now convinced, from thine own generosity of spirit, that he
received but yesterday a hundred zecchins.”

“speak not of that,” said rebecca, blushing deeply; “i see how easy it
is for the tongue to betray what the heart would gladly conceal.”

“but this sum of gold,” said ivanhoe, gravely, “my honour is concerned

in repaying it to your father.”

“let it be as thou wilt,” said rebecca, “when eight days have passed

“be it so, kind maiden,” said ivanhoe; “i were most ungrateful to
dispute thy commands. but one word of the fate of poor gurth, and i have
done with questioning thee.”

“i grieve to tell thee, sir knight,” answered the jewess, “that he is in
custody by the order of cedric.”--and then observing the distress which
her communication gave to wilfred, she instantly added, “but the steward
oswald said, that if nothing occurred to renew his master’s displeasure
against him, he was sure that cedric would pardon gurth, a faithful
serf, and one who stood high in favour, and who had but committed

he love which he bore to cedric’s son. and he said,
moreover, that he and his comrades, and especially wamba the jester,
were resolved to warn gurth to make his escape by the way, in case
cedric’s ire against him could not be mitigated.”

“would to god they may keep their purpose!” said ivanhoe; “but it seems
as if i were destined to bring ruin on whomsoever hath shown kindness to
me. my king, by whom i was honoured and distinguished, thou seest
that the brother most indebted to him is raising his arms to grasp his
crown;--my regard hath brought restraint and trouble on the fairest of

cy, and thrice did his arrow bound back from the knight’s armour of
proof.

“curse on thy spanish steel-coat!” said locksley, “had english smith
forged it, these arrows had gone through, an as if it had been silk or
sendal.” he then began to call out, “comrades! friends! noble cedric!
bear back, and let the ruin fall.”

his warning voice was unheard, for the din which the knight himself
occasioned by his strokes upon the postern would have drowned twenty
war-trumpets. the faithful gurth indeed sprung forward on the planked
bridge, to warn cedric of his impending fate, or to share it with him.
but his warning would have come too late; the massive pinnacle already
tottered, and de bracy, who still heaved at his task, would have
accomplished it, had not the voice of the templar sounded close in his
ears:--

“all is lost, de bracy, the castle burns.”

“thou art mad to say so!” replied the knight.

“it is all in a light flame on the western side. i have striven in vain

iegers pursued
the defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber, and satiated in
their blood the vengeance which had long animated them against the
soldiers of the tyrant front-de-boeuf. most of the garrison resisted to
the uttermost--few of them asked quarter--none received it. the air was
filled with groans and clashing of arms--the floors were slippery with
the blood of despairing and expiring wretches.

through this scene of confusion, cedric rushed in quest of rowena, while
the faithful gurth, following him closely through the “melee”, neglected
his own safety while he strove to avert the blows that were aimed at
his master. the noble saxon was so fortunate as to reach his ward’s
apartment just as she had abandoned all hope of safety, and, with a
crucifix clasped in agony to her bosom, sat in expectation of instant
death. he committed her to the charge of gurth, to be conducted in
safety to the barbican, the road to which was now cleared of the enemy,

thstanding that much was
consumed, a great deal of plate, rich armour, and splendid clothing,
had been secured by the exertions of the dauntless outlaws, who could be
appalled by no danger when such rewards were in view. yet so strict were
the laws of their society, that no one ventured to appropriate any
part of the booty, which was brought into one common mass, to be at the
disposal of their leader.

the place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which
locksley had conducted gurth and wamba in the earlier part of the story,
but one which was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre, within half a
mile of the demolished castle of torquilstone. here locksley assumed his
seat--a throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge
oak, and the silvan followers were gathered around him. he assigned to
the black knight a seat at his right hand, and to cedric a place upon
his left.

“pardon my freedom, noble sirs,” he said, “but in these glades i am
monarch--they are

feeling which even the death of athelstane had not extracted; but there
was something in the half-instinctive attachment of his clown, that
waked his nature more keenly than even grief itself.

“nay,” said the jester, extricating himself from master’s caress, “if
you pay my service with the water of your eye, the jester must weep
for company, and then what becomes of his vocation?--but, uncle, if you
would indeed pleasure me, i pray you to pardon my playfellow gurth, who
stole a week from your service to bestow it on your son.”

“pardon him!” exclaimed cedric; “i will both pardon and reward
him.--kneel down, gurth.”--the swineherd was in an instant at his
master’s feet--“theow and esne [40] art thou no longer,” said cedric
touching him with a wand; “folkfree and sacless [41] art thou in town
and from town, in the forest as in the field. a hide of land i give to

no longer a serf, but a freeman and a landholder, gurth sprung upon his
feet, and twice bounded aloft to almost his own height from the ground.
“a smith and a file,” he cried, “to do away the collar from the neck
of a freeman!--noble master! doubled is my strength by your gift, and
doubly will i fight for you!--there is a free spirit in my breast--i am
a man changed to myself and all around.--ha, fangs!” he continued,--for
that faithful cur, seeing his master thus transported, began to jump
upon him, to express his sympathy,--“knowest thou

 thy master still?”

“ay,” said wamba, “fangs and i still know thee, gurth, though we must
needs abide by the collar; it is only thou art likely to forget both us
and thyself.”

“i shall forget myself indeed ere i forget thee, true comrade,” said
gurth; “and were freedom fit for thee, wamba, the master would not let
thee want it.”

“nay,” said wamba, “never think i envy thee, brother gurth; the serf
sits by the hall-fire when the freeman must forth to the field of
battle--and what saith oldhelm of malmsbury--better a fool at a feast
than a wise man at a fray.”

the tramp of horses was now heard, and the lady rowena appeared,
surrounded by several riders, and a much stronger party of footmen, who
joyfully shook their pikes and clashed their brown-bills for joy of her
freedom. she herself, richly attired, and mounted on a dark chestnut
palfrey, had recovered all the dignity of he

     richard iii

when the black knight--for it becomes necessary to resume the train of
his adventures--left the trysting-tree of the generous outlaw, he held
his way straight to a neighbouring religious house, of small extent
and revenue, called the priory of saint botolph, to which the wounded
ivanhoe had been removed when the castle was taken, under the guidance
of the faithful gurth, and the magnanimous wamba. it is unnecessary at
present to mention what took place in the interim betwixt wilfred
and his deliverer; suffice it to say, that after long and grave
communication, messengers were dispatched by the prior in several
directions, and that on the succeeding morning the black knight was
about to set forth on his journey, accompanied by the jester wamba, who
attended as his guide.

“we will meet,” he said to ivanhoe, “at coningsburgh, the castle of the

unless you were to borrow a ride on the juggler’s steed that paces a

gentle and smooth-paced. i have composed many a homily on her back, to
the edification of my brethren of the convent, and many poor christian
souls.”

“i pray you, reverend father,” said ivanhoe, “let malkin be got ready
instantly, and bid gurth attend me with mine arms.”

“nay, but fair sir,” said the prior, “i pray you to remember that malkin
hath as little skill in arms as her master, and that i warrant not her
enduring the sight or weight of your full panoply. o, malkin, i
promise you, is a beast of judgment, and will contend against any undue
weight--i did but borrow the ‘fructus temporum’ from the priest of saint
bees, and i promise you she would not stir from the gate until i had
exchanged the huge volume for my litt

le breviary.”

“trust me, holy father,” said ivanhoe, “i will not distress her with too
much weight; and if she calls a combat with me, it is odds but she has
the worst.”

this reply was made while gurth was buckling on the knight’s heels a
pair of large gilded spurs, capable of convincing any restive horse that
his best safety lay in being conformable to the will of his rider.

the deep and sharp rowels with which ivanhoe’s heels were now
armed, began to make the worthy prior repent of his courtesy, and
ejaculate,--“nay, but fair sir, now i bethink me, my malkin abideth not
the spur--better it were that you tarry for the mare of our manciple
down at the grange, which may be had in little

fire-wood, and eateth no corn.”

“i thank you, reverend father, but will abide by your first offer, as
i see malkin is already led forth to the gate. gurth shall carry mine
armour; and for the rest, rely on it, that as i will not overload
malkin’s back, she shall not overcome my patience. and now, farewell!”

ivanhoe now descended the stairs more hastily and easily than his
wound promised, and threw himself upon the jennet, eager to escape the
importunity of the prior, who stuck as closely to his side as his
age and fatness would permit, now singing the praises of malkin, now
recommending caution to the knight in managing her.

“she is at th

e most dangerous period for maidens as well as mares,” said
the old man, laughing at his own jest, “being barely in her fifteenth
year.”

ivanhoe, who had other web to weave than to stand canvassing a palfrey’s
paces with its owner, lent but a deaf ear to the prior’s grave advices
and facetious jests, and having leapt on his mare, and commanded his
squire (for such gurth now called himself) to keep close by his side, he
followed the track of the black knight into the forest, while the
prior stood at the gate of the convent looking after him, and
ejaculating,--“saint mary! how prompt and fiery be these men of war!
i would i had not trusted malkin to his keeping, for, crippled as i
am with the cold rheum, i am undone if aught but good befalls her. and
yet,” said he, recollecting himself, “as i would not spare my own old

“a dainty song,” said wamba, when they had finished their carol, “and i

the jester next struck into another carol, a sort of comic ditty, to
which the knight, catching up the tune, replied i

at the same time, two additional personages appeared on the scene.

     all hail to the lordlings of high degree,

the new comers were wilfred of ivanhoe, on the prior of botolph’s
palfrey, and gurth, who attended him, on the knight’s own war-horse.
the astonishment of ivanhoe was beyond bounds, when he saw his master
besprinkled with blood, and six or seven dead bodies lying around in
the little glade in which the battle had taken place. nor was he less
surprised to see richard surrounded by so many silvan attendants, the
outlaws, as they seemed to be, of the forest, and a perilous retinue
therefore for a prince. he hesitated whether to address the king as the
black knight-errant, or in

and seizing his bow. the friar dropped the flagon, and grasped his
quarter-staff. wamba stopt short in the midst of a jest, and betook
himself to sword and target. all the others stood to their weapons.

men of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet
to the battle; and, to richard, the exchange seemed but a succession of
pleasure. he called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his
armour, which he had laid aside; and while gurth was putting them on,
he laid his strict injunctions on wilfred, under pain of his highest
displeasure, not to engage in the skirmish which he supposed was
approaching.

“thou hast fought for me an hundred times, wilfred,--and i have seen
it. thou shalt this day look on, and see how richard will fight for his
friend and liegeman.”

in the meantime, robin hood had sent off several of his followers in
different directions, as if to reconnoitre the enemy; and when he saw

from the unwilling hands of king john when he succeeded to his heroic

“now cheaply purchased at their weight in gold.”

the outlaw’s opinion proved true; and the king, attended by ivanhoe,
gurth, and wamba, arrived, without any interruption, within view of the
castle of coningsburgh, while the sun was yet in the horizon.

there are few more beautiful or striking scenes in england, than are
presented by the vicinity of this ancient saxon fortress. the soft and
gentle river don sweeps through an amphitheatre, in which cultivation is
richly blended with woodland, and on a mount, ascending from the river,
well defended by walls and ditches, rises this ancient edifice, which,

oe, more especially as he imagined the features of the latter were
familiar to him. besides, the approach of two knights, for such their
dress bespoke them, was a rare event at a saxon solemnity, and could not
but be regarded as a sort of honour to the deceased and his family. and
in his sable dress, and holding in his hand his white wand of office,
this important personage made way through the miscellaneous assemblage
of guests, thus conducting richard and ivanhoe to the entrance of the
tower. gurth and wamba speedily found acquaintances in the court-yard,
nor presumed to intrude themselves any farther until their presence
should be required.

all now looked around and enquired for ivanhoe, but he had vanished.
it was at length discovered that a jew had been to seek him; and that,
after very brief conference, he had called for gurth and his armour, and
had left the castle.

“fair cousin,” said athelstane to rowena, “could i think that this
sudden disappearance of ivanhoe was occasioned by other than the
weightiest reason, i would myself resume--”

but he had no sooner let go her hand, on first observing that ivanhoe
had disappeared, than rowena, who had found her situation extremely
embarrassing, had taken the first opportunity to escape from the
apartment.

the king himself attended, and from the countenance which he afforded on
this and other occasions to the distressed and hitherto degraded saxons,
gave them a safer and more certain prospect of attaining their just
rights, than they could reasonably hope from the precarious chance of
a civil war. the church gave her full solemnities, graced with all
the splendour which she of rome knows how to apply with such brilliant
effect.

gurth, gallantly apparelled, attended as esquire upon his young master
whom he had served so faithfully, and the magnanimous wamba, decorated
with a new cap and a most gorgeous set of silver bells. sharers of
wilfred’s dangers and adversity, they remained, as they had a right to
expect, the partakers of his more prosperous career.

but besides this domestic retinue, these distinguished nuptials were
celebrated by the attendance of the high-born normans, as well as
saxons, joined with the universal
