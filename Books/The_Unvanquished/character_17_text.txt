yes rolling a little.


he wasn't a nigger any more and he showed me what he had in his hand. it was a new
scrip dollar; it was drawn on the united states, resident treasurer, yoknapatawpha
county, mississippi, and signed "cassius q. benbow, acting marshal" in a neat clerk's hand,
with a big sprawling x under it.


with the yankees two years ago. he back now and he gonter be elected marshal of
jefferson. that's what marse john and the other white folks is so busy about."


told me about the two burdens from missouri, with a patent from washington to organise
the niggers into republicans, and how father and the other men were trying to prevent it
"naw, suh," he said. "this war ain't over. hit jus started good. used to be when you seed a
yankee you knowed him because he never had nothing but a gun or a mule halter or a
handful of hen feathers. now you don' even know him and stid of the gun he got a clutch
of this stuff in one hand and a clutch of nigger voting tickets in the yuther." so we were

said. "it don't matter. come. get up, soldier."

whipped; like in the dress she could neither fight back nor run away. and so she didn't
come down to the log-yard any more, and now that father and i slept in the cabin with
joby and ringo, i didn't even see drusilla except at mealtime. and we were busy getting
the timber out, and now everybody was talking about the election and how father had
told the two burdens before all the men in town that the election would never be held with
cash benbow or any other nigger in it and how the burdens had dared him to stop it. and
besides, the other cabin would be full of jefferson ladies all day; you would have thought
that drusilla was mrs. habersham's daughter and not aunt louisa's. they would begin to
arrive right after breakfast and stay all day, so that at supper aunt louisa would sit in her
black mourning except for the bonnet and umbrella, with a wad of some

 kind of black
knitting she carried around with her and that never got finished and the folded
handkerchief handy in her belt (only she ate fine; she ate more than father even because
the election was just a week off and i reckon he was thinking about the burdens) and
refusing to speak to anybody except denny; and drusilla trying to eat, with her face
strained and thin and her eyes like somebody's that had been whipped a long time now
and is going just on nerve.

than i was, but she had let aunt louisa and mrs. habersham choose the game and she
had beat them both until that night when aunt louisa went behind her back and chose a
game she couldn't beat. i was coming up to supper; i heard them inside the cabin before i
could stop: "can't you believe me?"

father got up too; i passed him standing beside drusilla with his hand on her head. "they
have beat you, drusilla," he said.

mrs. habersham got there before we had finished breakfast the next morning. i don't
know how aunt louisa got word in to her so quick. but there she was, and she and aunt
louisa set the wedding for the day after tomorrow. i don't reckon they even knew that that
was the day father had told the burdens cash benbow would never be elected marshal in
jefferson. i don't reckon they paid any more attention to it than if all the men had decided
that day after tomorrow all the clocks in jefferson were to be set back or up an hour.
maybe they didn't even know there was to be an election, that all the , men in the county
would be riding toward jefferson tomorrow with pistols in their pockets, and that the
burdens already had their nigger voters camped in a cotton gin on the edge of town
under guard. i

wreath and they all helped drusilla to dress, only aunt louisa made drusilla put on father's

"who?" aunt louisa hollered. "where have you been?"
"to town!" benny hollered. "them two burdens! they kilt um!"
"who killed them?" aunt louisa hollered.
"drusilla and cousin john!" benny hollered. then louvinia said how aunt louisa

and brushed, and i helped drusilla on with aunt louisa and the others all watching from
the porch. but i didn't know that ringo was missing when we started, not even when i
heard aunt louisa hollering for benny while we rode down the drive. it was louvinia that
told abo
