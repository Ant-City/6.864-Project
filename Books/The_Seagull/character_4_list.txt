Sorin  - 
      Sorin is the sixty-year-old landowner of the estate where the play takes place. He spent his life working for a government office and retired to his country farm. Sorin is the brother of Arkadina and the uncle to Treplev. His health deteriorates during the course of the play. Sorin is a patient listener, a confidant, and a compassionate admirer of both his nephew and sister's talents. He is disappointed with his life's decisions its outcome; he once wished to find love and be a successful writer and never acquired either wish. Sorin sees himself in the young Treplev and asks his sister Arkadina to be easier on Treplev's vulnerable confidence. Sorin can be wistful, nostalgic and wise.
