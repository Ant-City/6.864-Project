[CHARACTER] - 
                the high admiral of lilliput, who is the only member
of the administration to oppose gulliver's liberation. gulliver
imagines that skyresh's enmity is simply personal, though there
is no apparent reason for such hostility. arguably, skyresh's hostility
may be merely a tool to divert gulliver from the larger system of
lilliputian exploitation to which he is subjected.
