'boromir is dead,' said aragorn. 'i am unscathed, for i was not here with him. he fell defending the hobbits, while i was away upon the hill.'
'the hobbits!' cried gimli 'where are they then? where is frodo?'
'i do not know,' answered aragorn wearily. 'before he died boromir told me that the orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. i sent him to follow merry and pippin; but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him: not until it was too late. all that i have done today has gone amiss. what is to be done now?'
'first we must tend the fallen,' said legolas. 'we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs.'
'but we must be swift,' said gimli. 'he would not wish us to linger. we must follow the orcs, if there is hope that any of our company are living prisoners.'
'but we do not know whether the ring-bearer is with them or not ' said aragorn. '

ight, away from the main trail; for he had seen footprints that went that way, branching off from the others, the marks of small unshod feet. these, however, did not go far before they were crossed by orc-prints, also coming out from the main trail behind and in front, and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the trampling. at the furthest point aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back.
'yes,' he said, 'they are quite plain: a hobbit's footprints. pippin's i think. he is smaller than the other. and look at this! he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight. it looked like the new-opened leaf of a beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain.
'the brooch of an elven-cloak!' cried legolas and gimli together.
'not idly do the leaves of lórien fall,' said aragorn. 'this did not drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow. i think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose.'

aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle, but the light faded, and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin.
'we can do no more,' said gimli sadly. 'we have been set many riddles since we came to tol brandir, but this is the hardest to unravel. i would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the orcs'. it will be hard news for frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in rivendell. elrond was against their coming.'

'but gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' answered gimli. 'his fores

the night passed slowly. legolas followed aragorn, and gimli followed legolas, and their watches wore away. but nothing happened. the old man did not appear again, and the horses did not return.

chapter 3

the uruk-hai

pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear his own small voice echoing in black tunnels, calling frodo, frodo! but instead of frodo hundreds of hideous orc-faces grinned at him out of the shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side. where was merry?
he woke. cold air blew on his face. he was lying on his back. evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim. he turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking. his wrists, legs, and a

nkles were tied with cords. beside him merry lay, white-faced, with a dirty rag bound across his brows. all about them sat or stood a great company of orcs.
slowly in pippin's aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated from dream-shadows. of course: he and merry had run off into the woods. what had come over them? why had they dashed off like that, taking no notice of old strider? they had run a long way shouting--he could not remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed right into a group of orcs: they were standing listening, and they did not appear to see merry and pippin until they were almost in their arms. then they yel

ood old merry!
then boromir had come leaping through the trees. he had made them fight. he slew many of them and the rest fled. but they had not gone far on the way back when they were attacked again. by a hundred orcs at least, some of them very large, and they shot a rain of arrows: always at boromir. boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and at first the orcs had been dismayed and had drawn back; but when no answer but the echoes came, they had attacked more fierce than ever. pippin did not remember much more. his last memo was of boromir leaning against a tree, plucking out an arrow; then darkness fell suddenly.
'i suppose i was knocked on the head,' he said to himself. 'i wonder if poor merry is much hurt. what has happened to boromir? why didn't the orcs kill us? where are we, and where are we going?'
he could not answer the questions. he felt cold and sick. 'i wish gandalf had never persuaded elrond to let us come,' he thought. 'what good have i been? just a nuisance:

a passenger, a piece of luggage. and now i have been stolen and i am just a piece of luggage for the orcs. i hope strider or someone will come and claim us! but ought i to hope for it? won't that throw out all the plans? i wish i could get free!'
he struggled a little, quite uselessly. one of the orcs sitting near laughed and said something to a companion in their abominable tongue. 'rest while you can, little fool!' he said then to pippin, in the common speech, which he made almost as hideous as his own language. 'rest while you can! we'll find a use for your legs before long. you'll wish you had got none before we get home.'
'if i had my way, you'd wish you were dead now,' said the other. 'i'd make you squeak, you miserable rat.' he stooped over pippin bringing his yellow fangs close to his face. he had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand. 'lie quiet, or i'll tickle you with this,' he hissed. 'don't draw attentio

n to yourself, or i may forget my orders. curse the isengarders! uglúk u bagronk sha pushdug saruman-glob búbhosh skai': he passed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering and snarling.
terrified pippin lay still, though the pain at his wrists and ankles was growing, and the stones beneath him were boring into his back. to take his mind off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear. there were many voices round about, and though orc-speech sounded at all times full of hate and anger, it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had begun, and was getting hotter.
to pippin's surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligible many of the orcs were using ordinary language. app

, perhaps? who does he think he is, setting up on his own with his filthy white badges? they might agree with me, with grishnákh their trusted messenger; and i grishnákh say this: saruman is a fool. and a dirty treacherous fool. but the great eye is on him.
'swine is it? how do you folk like being called swine by the muck-rakers of a dirty little wizard? it's orc-flesh they eat, i'll warrant.'
many loud yells in orc-speech answered him, and the ringing clash of weapons being drawn. cautiously pippin rolled over, hoping to see what would happen. his guards had gone to join in the fray. in the twilight he saw a large black orc, probably uglúk, standing facing grishnákh, a short crook-legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the ground. round them were many smaller goblins. pippin supposed that these were the ones from the north. they had drawn their knives and swords, but hesitated to attack uglúk.
uglúk shouted, and a number of other orcs of nearly his own size

 ran up. then suddenly, without warning, uglúk sprang forwards, and with two swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents. grishnákh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows. the others gave way, and one stepped backwards and fell over merry's prostrate form with a curse. yet that probably saved his life, for uglúk's followers leaped over him and cut down another with their broad-bladed swords. it was the yellow-fanged guard. his body fell right on top of pippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife.
'put up your weapons!' shouted uglúk. 'and let's have no more nonsense! we go straight west from here, and down the stair. from there straight to the downs, then along the river to the forest. and we march day and night. that clear?'
'now,' thought pippin, 'if only it takes that ugly fellow a little while to get his troop under control, i've got a chance.' a gleam of hope had come to him. the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm, and then slid

down to his wrist. he felt the blood trickling on to his hand, but he also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin.
the orcs were getting ready to march again, but some of the northerners were still unwilling, and the isengarders slew two more before the rest were cowed. there was much cursing and confusion. for the moment pippin was unwatched. his legs were securely bound, but his arms were only tied about the wrists, and his hands were in front of him. he could move them both together, though the bonds were cruelly tight. he pushed the dead orc to one side, then hardly daring to breathe, he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up and down against the blade of the knife. it was sharp and the dead hand held it fast. the cord was cut! quickly pippin took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of two loop

s and slipped it over his hands. then he lay very still.
'pick up those prisoners!' shouted uglúk. 'don't play any tricks with them! if they are not alive when we get back, someone else will die too.'
an orc seized pippin like a sack. put its head between his tied hands, grabbed his arms and dragged them down, until pippin's face was crushed against its neck; then it jolted off with him. another treated merry in the same way. the orc's clawlike hand gripped pippin's arms like iron; the nails bit into him. he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams.
suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. it was early night, but the slim moon was already falling westward. they were on the edge of a cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist. there was a sound of water falling nearby.
'the scouts have come back at last,' said an orc close at hand.
'well, what did you discover?' growled the voice of uglúk.
'only a single horseman, and he made

'now, i daresay. but how long? you fools! you should have shot him. he'll raise the alarm. the cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning. now we'll have to leg it double quick.'
a shadow bent over pippin. it was uglúk. 'sit up!' said the orc. 'my lads are tired of lugging you about. we have got to climb down and you must use your legs. be helpful now. no crying out, no trying to escape. we have ways of paying for tricks that you won't like, though they won't spoil your usefulness for the master.'
he cut the thongs round pippin's legs and ankles, picked him up by his hair and stood him on his feet. pippin fell down, and uglúk dragged him up by his hair again. several orcs laughed. uglúk thrus

t a flask between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat: he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him. the pain in his legs and ankles vanished. he could stand.
'now for the other!' said uglúk. pippin saw him go to merry, who was lying close by, and kick him. merry groaned. seizing him roughly uglúk pulled him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off his head. then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box. merry cried out and struggled wildly.
the orcs clapped and hooted. 'can't take his medicine,' they jeered. 'doesn't know what's good for him. ai! we shall have some fun later.'
but at the moment uglúk was not engaged in sport. he needed speed and had t

o humour unwilling followers. he was healing merry in orc-fashion; and his treatment worked swiftly. when he had forced a drink from his flask down the hobbit's throat, cut his leg-bonds, and dragged him to his feet, merry stood up, looking pale but grim and defiant, and very much alive. the gash in his forehead gave him no more trouble, but he bore a brown scar to the end of his days.
'hullo, pippin!' he said. 'so you've come on this little expedition, too? where do we get bed and breakfast?'
'now then!' said uglúk. 'none of that! hold your tongues. no talk to one another. any trouble will be reported at the other end, and he'll know how to pay you. you'll get bed and breakfast all right: more than you can stomach.'
the orc-band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the misty plain below. merry and pippin, separated by a dozen orcs or more, climbed down with them. at the bott

'but we can't run in the sunlight.'
'you'll run with me behind you,' said uglúk. 'run! or you'll never see your beloved holes again. by the white hand! what's the use of sending out mountain-maggots on a trip, only half trained. run, curse you! run while night lasts!'
then the whole company began to run with the long loping strides of orcs. they kept no order, thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their speed was very great. each hobbit had a guard of three. pippin was far back in the line. he wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace: he had had no food since the morning. one of his guards had a whip. but at present the orc-liquor was still hot in him. his wits, too, were wide-awake.
every now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the keen face of strider bending over a dark trail, and running, running behind. but what could even a ranger see except a confused trail of orc-feet? his own little prints and merry's were over

whelmed by the trampling of the iron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about them.
they had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet. mist lay there, pale-glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon. the dark shapes of the orcs in front grew dim, and then were swallowed up.
'ai! steady now!' shouted uglúk from the rear.
a sudden thought leaped into pippin's mind, and he acted on it at once. he swerved aside to the right, and dived out of the reach of his clutching guard, headfirst into the mist; he landed sprawling on the grass.
'halt!' yelled uglúk.
there was for a moment turmoil and confusion. pippin sprang up and ran. but the orcs were after him. some suddenly loomed up right in front of him.
'no hope of escape!' thought pippin. 'but there is a hope that i have left some of my own marks unspoilt on the wet ground.' he groped with his two tie

throat, and unclasped the brooch of his cloak. just as long arms and hard claws seized him. he let it fall. 'there i suppose it will lie until the end of time,' he thought. 'i don't know why i did it. if the others have escaped, they've probably all gone with frodo.'
a whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry.
'enough!' shouted uglúk running up. 'he's still got to run a long way yet. make 'em both run! just use the whip as a reminder.'
'but that's not all,' he snarled, turning to pippin. 'i shan't forget. payment is only put off. leg it!'
neither pippin nor merry remembered much of the later part of the journey. evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of misery, with hope growing ever fainter behind. they ran, and they ran, striving to keep up the pace set by the orcs, licked every now and again with a cruel thong cunningly handled. if they halted or stumbled, they were seized and dragged for some distance.
the warmth of the orc-draught had gone. pippin fel

t, slant-eyed orcs with great bows and short broad-bladed swords. a few of the larger and bolder northerners remained with them.
'now we'll deal with grishnákh,' said uglúk; but some even of his own followers were looking uneasily southwards.
'i know,' growled uglúk. 'the cursed horse-boys have got wind of us. but that's all your fault, snaga. you and the other scouts ought to have your ears cut off. but we are the fighters. we'll feast on horseflesh yet, or something better.'
at that moment pippin saw why some of the troop had been pointing eastward. from that direction there now came hoarse cries, and there was grishnákh again, and at his back a couple of score of others like him: long-armed crook-legged orcs. they had a red eye painted on their shields. uglúk stepped forward to meet them. 'so you've come back?' he said. 'thought better of it, eh?'
'i've returned to see that orders are carried out and the prisoners safe,' answered grishnákh.
'indeed!' said uglúk. 'waste of effort. i

they're for the war-and other purposes.'
'you seem to know a lot,' said uglúk. 'more than is good for you, i guess. perhaps those in lugbúrz might wonder how, and why. but in the meantime the uruk-hai of isengard can do the dirty work, as usual. don't stand slavering there! get your rabble together! the other swine are legging it to the forest. you'd better follow. you wouldn't get back to the great river alive. right off the mark! now! i'll be on your heels.'
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their backs. then the troop started off. hour after hour they ran, pausing now and again only to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers. either because they were quicker and hardier, or because of some plan of grishnákh's, the isengarders gradually passed through the orcs of mordor, and grishnákh's folk closed in behind. soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahead. the forest began to draw nearer.
pippin was bruised and torn, his aching head was grated by the fil

g in a pale cool sky though it was; their heads were down and their tongues lolling out.
'maggots!' jeered the isengarders. 'you're cooked. the whiteskins will catch you and eat you. they're coming!'
a cry from grishnákh showed that this was not mere jest. horsemen, riding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still far behind, but gaining on the orcs, gaining on them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in a quicksand.
the isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that astonished pippin, a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race. then he saw that the sun was sinking, falling behind the misty mountains; shadows reached over the land. the soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed. the forest was dark and close. already they had passed a few outlying trees. the land was beginning to slope upwards. ever more steeply; but the orcs did not halt. both uglúk and grishnákh shouted, spurring them on to a last effort.
'they will make it yet. they will

escape,' thought pippin. and then he managed to twist his neck. so as to glance back with one eye over his shoulder. he saw that riders away eastward were already level with the orcs, galloping over the plain. the sunset gilded their spears and helmets, and glinted in their pale flowing hair. they were hemming the orcs in, preventing them from scattering, and driving them along the line of the river.
he wondered very much what kind of folk they were. he wished now that he had learned more in rivendell, and looked more

ogether with their captors, before ever the men of rohan were aware of them.
a few of the riders appeared to be bowmen, skilled at shooting from a running horse. riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs that straggled behind, and several of them fell; then the riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering bows of their enemies, who shot wildly, not daring to halt. this happened many times, and on one occasion arrows fell among the isengarders. one of them, just in front of pippin, stumbled and did not get up again.
night came down without the riders closing in for battle. many orcs had fallen, but fully two hundred remained. in the early darkness the orcs came to a hillock. the eaves of the forest were very near, probably no more than three furlongs away, but they could go no further. the horsemen had encircled them. a small band disobeyed uglúk's command, and ran on towards the forest: only three returned.
'well, here we are,' sneered grishnákh. 'fine leadership! i h

ope the great uglúk will lead us out again.'
'put those halflings down!' ordered uglúk, taking no notice of grishnákh. 'you, lugdush, get two others and stand guard over them! they're not to be killed, unless the filthy whiteskins break through. understand? as long as i'm alive, i want 'em. but they're not to cry out, and they're not to be rescued. bind their legs!'
the last part of the order was carried out mercilessly. but pippin found that for the first time he was close to merry. the orcs were making a great deal of noise, shouting and clashing their weapons, and the hobbits managed to whisper together for a while.
'i don't think much of this,' said merry. 'i feel nearly done in. don't think i could crawl away far, even if i was free.'
'lembas!' whispered pippin. 'lembas: i've got some. have you? i don't think they've taken anything but our swords.'
'yes, i had a packet in my pocket,' answered merry, 'but it must be b

attered to crumbs. anyway i can't put my mouth in my pocket!'
'you won't have to. i've-'; but just then a savage kick warned pippin that the noise had died down, and the guards were watchful.
the night was cold and still. all round the knoll on which the orcs were gathered little watch-fires sprang up, golden-red in the darkness, a complete ring of them. they were within a long bowshot. but the riders did not show themselves against the light, and the orcs wasted many arrows shooting at the fires, until uglúk stopped them. the riders made no sound. later in the night when the moon came out of the mist, then occasionally th

 horses! they can see the night-breeze, or so it's said. still there's one thing the fine fellows don't know: mauhúr and his lads are in the forest, and they should turn up any time now.'
uglúk's words were enough, apparently, to satisfy the isengarders; but the other orcs were both dispirited and rebellious. they posted a few watchers, but most of them lay on the ground, resting in the pleasant darkness. it did indeed become very dark again; for the moon passed westward into thick cloud, and pippin could not see anything a few feet away. the fires brought no light to the hillock. the riders were not, however, content merely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest. a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. it seemed that some of the men had ridden in close, slipped off their horses, crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several orcs, and then had faded away again. uglúk dashed off to stop a stampede.
pippin and merry sat up. their guards,

isengarders, had gone with uglúk. but if the hobbits had any thought of escape, it was soon dashed. a long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together. dimly they were aware of grishnákh's great head and hideous face between them; his foul breath was on their cheeks. he began to paw them and feel them. pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back.
'well, my little ones!' said grishnákh in a soft whisper. 'enjoying your nice rest? or not? a little awkwardly placed, perhaps: swords and whips on one side, and nasty spears on the other! little people should not meddle _in affairs that are too big for them.' his fingers continued to grope. there was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes.
the thought came suddenly into pippin's mind, as if caught direct from the urgent thought of

 his enemy: 'grishnákh knows about the ring! he's looking for it, while uglúk is busy: he probably wants it for himself.' cold fear was in pippin's heart, yet at the same time he was wondering what use he could make of grishnákh's desire.
'i don't think you will find it that way,' he whispered. 'it isn't easy to find.'
'find it?' said grishnákh: his fingers stopped crawling and gripped pippin's shoulder. 'find what? what are you talking about, little one?'. for a moment pippin was silent. then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat: gollum, gollum. 'nothing, my precious,' he added.
the hobbits felt grishnákh's fingers twitch. 'o ho!' hissed the goblin softly. 'that's what he means, is it? o ho! very ve-ry dangerous, my little ones.'
'perhaps,' said merry, now alert and aware of pippin's guess. 'perhaps; and not only for us. still you know your own business best. do you want it, or not? and what would you give for it?'
'do i want it? do i want it?' sa

id grishnákh, as if puzzled; but his arms were trembling. 'what would i give for it? what do you mean?'
'we mean,' said pippin, choosing his words carefully, 'that it's no good groping in the dark. we could save you time and trouble. but you must untie our legs first, or we'll do nothing, and say nothing.'
'my dear tender little fools,' hissed grishnákh, 'everything you have, and everything you know, will be got out of you in due time: everything! you'll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy the questioner, indeed you will: quite soon. we shan't hurry the enquiry. oh dear no! what do you think you've been

 it doesn't seem to be going your way, whatever happens. if we come to isengard, it won't be the great grishnákh that benefits: saruman will take all that he can find. if you want anything for yourself, now's the time to do a deal.'
grishnákh began to lose his temper. the name of saruman seemed specially to enrage him. time was passing and the disturbance was dying down. uglúk or the isengarders might return at any minute.
'have you got it - either of you?' he snarled.
'gollum, gollum!' said pippin.
'untie our legs!' said merry.
they felt the orc's arms trembling violently. 'curse you, you filthy little vermin!' he hissed. 'untie your legs? i'll untie every string in your bodies. do you think i can't search you to the bones? search you! i'll cut you both to quivering shreds. i don't need the help of your legs to get you away-and have you all to myself!'
suddenly he seized them. the strength in his long arms and shoulders was terrifying. he tucked them one under each armpit, and crushed th

: uglúk was probably knocking off a few more heads. then suddenly the answering cries of orc-voices came from the right, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the direction of the forest and the mountains. mauhúr had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers. there was the sound of galloping horses. the riders were drawing in their ring close round the knoll, risking the orc-arrows, so as to prevent any sortie, while a company rode off to deal with the newcomers. suddenly merry and pippin realized that without moving they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape.
'now,' said merry, 'if only we had our legs and hands free, we might get away. but i can't touch the knots, and i can't bite them.'
'no need to try,' said pippin. 'i was going to tell you: i've managed to free my hands. these loops are only left for show. you'd better have a bit of lembas first.'
he slipped the cords off his wrists, and fished out a packet. the cakes were broken, but good,

still in their leaf-wrappings. the hobbits each ate two or three pieces. the taste brought back to them the memory of fair faces, and laughter, and wholesome food in quiet days now far away. for a while they ate thoughtfully, sitting in the dark, heedless of the cries and sounds of battle nearby. pippin was the first to come back to the present.
'we must be off,' he said. 'half a moment!' grishnákh's sword was lying close at hand, but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use; so he crawled forward, and finding the body of the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife. with this he quickly cut their bonds.
'now for it!' he said. 'when we've warmed up a bit, perhaps we shall be able to stand again, and walk. but in any case we had better start by crawling.'
they crawled. the turf was

ire a wide berth, and wormed their way forward bit by bit, until they came to the edge of the river, gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks. then they looked back.
the sounds had died away. evidently mauhúr and his 'lads' had been killed or driven off. the riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil. it would not last very much longer. already the night was old. in the east, which had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale.
'we must get under cover,' said pippin, 'or we shall be seen. it will not be any comfort to us, if these riders discover that we are not orcs after we are dead.' he got up and stamped his feet. 'those cords have cut me like wires; but my feet are getting warm again. i could stagger on now. what about you, merry?'
merry got up. 'yes,' he said, 'i can manage it. lembas does put heart into you! a more wholesome sort of feeling, too, than the heat of that orc-draught. i wonder what it was made of. better not to know, i expect. let's get

'not here, the banks are too steep,' said pippin. 'forward now!'
they turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river. behind them the light grew in the east. as they walked they compared notes, talking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that had happened since their capture. no listener would have guessed from their words that they had suffered cruelly, and been in dire peril, going without hope towards torment and death; or that even now, as they knew well, they had little chance of ever finding friend or safety again

even as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before them. night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees, creeping away from the coming dawn.
'lead on, master brandybuck!' said pippin. 'or lead back! we have been warned against fangorn. but one so knowing will not have forgotten that.'
'i have not,' answered merry; 'but the forest seems better to me, all the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.'
he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees. old beyond guessing, they seemed. great trailing beards of lichen hung from them, blowing and swaying in the breeze. out of the shadows the hobbits peeped, gazing back down the slope: little furtive figures that

in the dim light looked like elf-children in the deeps of time peering out of the wild wood in wonder at their first dawn.
far over the great river, and the brown lands, leagues upon grey leagues away, the dawn came, red as flame. loud rang the hunting-horns to greet it. the riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life. horn answered horn again.
merry and pippin heard, clear in the cold air, the neighing of war-horses, and the sudden singing of many men. the sun's limb was lifted, an arc of fire, above the margin of the world. then with a great cry the riders charged from the east; the red light gleamed on mail and spear. the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them. the hobbits saw several horsemen fall; but their line held on up the hill and over it, and wheeled round and charged again. most of the raiders that were left alive then b

meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled forest allowed, following the line of the running stream, westward and up towards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into fangorn. slowly their fear of the orcs died away, and their pace slackened. a queer stifling feeling came over them, as if the air were too thin or too scanty for breathing.
at last merry halted. 'we can't go on like this,' he panted. 'i want some air.'
'let's have a drink at any rate,' said pippin. 'i'm parched.' he clambered on to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream, and stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. it was clear and cold, and he took many draughts. merry followed him. the water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts; for a while they sat together on the brink of the stream, dabbling their sore feet and legs, and peering round at the trees that stood silently about them, rank upon rank, until they faded away into grey twilight in every direction

.
'i suppose you haven't lost us already?' said pippin, leaning back against a great tree-trunk. 'we can at least follow the course of this stream, the entwash or whatever you call it, and get out again the way we came.'
'we could, if our legs would do it,' said merry; 'and if we could breathe properly.'
'yes, it is all very dim, and stuffy, in here,' said pippin. 'it reminds me, somehow, of the old room in the great place of the tooks away back in the smials at tuckborough: a huge place, where the furniture has never been moved or changed for generations. they say the old took lived in it year after year, while he and the room got older and shabbier together-and it has never changed since he died, a century ago. and old gerontius was my great-great-grandfather: that puts it back a bit. but that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood. look at all th

'but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes.' said merry. 'it does not look or feel at all like bilbo's description of mirkwood. that was all dark and black, and the home of dark black things. this is just dim, and frightfully tree-ish. you can't imagine animals living here at all, or staying for long.'
'no, nor hobbits,' said pippin. 'and i don't like the thought of trying to get through it either. nothing to eat for a hundred miles, i should guess. how are our supplies?'
'low,' said merry. 'we ran off with nothing but a couple of spare packets of lembas, and left everything else behind.' they looked at what remained of the elven-cakes: broken fragments for about five meagre days, that was all. 'and not a wrap or a blanket,' said merry. 'we shall be cold tonight, whichever way we go.'
'well, we'd better decide on the way n

ow,' said pippin. 'the morning must be getting on.'
just then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared, some way further on into the wood: shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest-roof.
'hullo!' said merry. 'the sun must have run into a cloud while we've been under these trees, and now she has run out again; or else she has climbed high enough to look down through some opening. it isn't far - let's go and investigate!'
they found it was further than they thought. the ground was

lmost at the feet of the old stump; then they sprang up and turned round with their backs to the hill, breathing deep, and looking out eastward. they saw that they had only come some three or four miles into the forest: the heads of the trees marched down the slopes towards the plain. there, near the fringe of the forest, tall spires of curling black smoke went up, wavering and floating towards them.
'the wind's changing,' said merry. 'it's turned east again. it feels cool up here.'
'yes,' said pippin; 'i'm afraid this is only a passing gleam, and it will all go grey again. what a pity! this shaggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight. i almost felt i liked the place.'
'almost felt you liked the forest! that's good! that's uncommonly kind of you,' said a strange voice. 'turn round and let me have a look at your faces. i almost feel that i dislike you both, but do not let us be hasty. turn round!' a large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders, and they were twisted

difficult to say. at any rate the arms, at a short distance from the trunk, were not wrinkled, but covered with a brown smooth skin. the large feet had seven toes each. the lower part of the long face was covered with a sweeping grey beard, bushy, almost twiggy at the roots, thin and mossy at the ends. but at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes. these deep eyes were now surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating. they were brown, shot with a green light. often afterwards pippin tried to describe his first impression of them.
'one felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their surface was sparkling with the present: like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep lake. i don't know but it felt as if something that grew in the ground-asleep, you might say, or just feeling itself as something between roof-tip and leaf-tip, between deep earth and sky had s

'hrum, hoom,' murmured the voice, a deep voice like a very deep woodwind instrument. 'very odd indeed! do not be hasty, that is my motto. but if i had seen you, before i heard your voices - i liked them: nice little voices; they reminded me of something i cannot remember - if i had seen you before i heard you, i should have just trodden on you, taking you for little orcs, and found out my mistake afterwards. very odd you are, indeed. root and twig, very odd!'
pippin, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. under those eyes he felt a curious suspense, but not fear. 'please.' he said, 'who are you? and what are you?'
a queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep wells were covered over. 'hrum, now,' answered the voice; 'well, i am an ent, or that's what they call me. yes, ent is the word. the ent, i am, you might say, in your manner of speaking. fangorn is my name according to some, treebeard others make it. treebeard will do.'

'we always seem to have got left out of the old lists, and the old stories,' said merry. 'yet we've been about for quite a long time. we're hobbits.'
'why not make a new line?' said pippin.
'half-grown hobbits, the hole-dwellers.
put us in amongst the four, next to man (the big people) and you've got it.'
'hm! not bad, not bad,' said treebeard. 'that would do. so you live in holes, eh? it sounds very right and proper. who calls you hobbits, though? that does not sound elvish to me. elves made all the old words: they began it.'
'nobody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,' said pippin.

'we aren't careful about that,' said merry. 'as a matter of fact i'm a brandybuck, meriadoc brandybuck, though most people call me just merry.'
'and i'm a took, peregrin took, but i'm generally called pippin, or even pip.'

'there is quite a lot going on,' said merry: 'and even if we tried to be quick, it would take a long time to tell. but you told us not to be hasty. ought we to tell you anything so soon? would you think it rude, if we asked what you are going to do with us, and which side you are on? and did you know gandalf?'
'yes, i do know him: the only wizard that really cares about trees ' said treebeard. 'do you know him?'
'yes,' said pippin sadly, 'we did. he was a great friend, and he was our guide.'
'then i can answer your other questions,' said treebeard. 'i am not going to do anything with you: not if you mean by that 'do something to you' without your leave. we might do some things together. i don't know about sides. i go my own way; but your way may go along with mine for a while. but you speak of master gandalf, as if he was in a story that had come to an end.'

'if you would like to hear more. said merry, 'we will tell you. but it will take some time. wouldn't you like to put us down? couldn't we sit here together in the sun, while it lasts? you must be getting tired of holding us up.'
'hm, tired? no. i am not tired. i do not easily get tired. and i do not sit down. i am not very, hm, bendable. but there, the sun is going in. let us leave this - did you say what you call it?'

treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully. 'hill. yes, that was it. but it is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of the world was shaped. never mind. let us leave it, and go.'
'where shall we go?' asked merry.
'to my home, or one of my homes,' answered treebeard.

 the stream, climbing steadily up towards the slopes of the mountains. many of the trees seemed asleep, or as unaware of him as of any other creature that merely passed by; but some quivered, and some raised up their branches above his head as he approached. all the while, as he walked, he talked to himself in a long running stream of musical sounds.
the hobbits were silent for some time. they felt, oddly enough, safe and comfortable, and they had a great deal to think and wonder about. at last pippin ventured to speak again.
'please, treebeard,' he said, 'could i ask you something? why did celeborn warn us against your forest? he told us not to risk getting entangled in it.'
'hmm, did he now?' rumbled treebeard. 'and i might have said much the same, if you had been going the other way. do not risk getting entangled in the woods of laurelindórenan! that is what the elves used to call it, but now they make the name shorter: lothlórien they call it. perhaps they are right: maybe it is fading

that is what they used to say. things have changed, but it is still true in places.'
'what do you mean?' said pippin. 'what is true?'
'the trees and the ents,' said treebeard. 'i do not understand all that goes on myself, so i cannot explain it to you. some of us are still true ents, and lively enough in our fashion, but many are growing sleepy, going tree-ish, as you might say. most of the trees are just trees, of course; but many are half awake. some are quite wide awake, and a few are, well, ah, well getting entish. that is going on all the time.
'when that happens to a tree, you find that some have bad he

down; that will prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep.'
on the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs; not more than a couple of feet high, covered deep in dried grass and bracken. treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of bending at his middle), until he lay at full length, with his arms behind his head, looking up at the ceiling. upon which lights were flickering, like the play of leaves in the sunshine. merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass.
'now tell me your tale, and do not hurry!' said treebeard.
the hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since they left hobbiton. they followed no very clear order, for they interrupted one another continually, and treebeard often stopped the speaker, and went back to some earlier point, or jumped forward asking questions about later events. they said nothing whatever about the ring, and did not tell him why they set out or where they were

 going to; and he did not ask for any reasons.
he was immensely interested in everything: in the black riders, in elrond, and rivendell, in the old forest, and tom bombadil, in the mines of moria, and in lothlórien and galadriel. he made them describe the shire and its country over and over again. he said an odd thing at this point. 'you never see any, hm, any ents round there do you?' he asked. 'well, not ents, entwives i should really say.'
'entwives?' said pippin. 'are they like you at all?'
'yes, hm, well no: i do not really know now,' said treebeard thoughtfully. 'but they would like your country, so i just wondered.'
treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned gandalf; and most interested of all in saruman's doings. the hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them: only a rather vague report by sam of what gandalf had told the council. but they were clear at any rate that uglúk and his troop came from

xious when the shadow lay on mirkwood, but when it removed to mordor, i did not trouble for a while: mordor is a long way away. but it seems that the wind is setting east, and the withering of all woods may be drawing near. there is naught that an old ent can do to hold back that storm: he must weather it or crack.
'but saruman now! saruman is a neighbour: i cannot overlook him. i must do something, i suppose. i have often wondered lately what i should do about saruman.'
'who is saruman?' asked pippin. 'do you know anything about his history?' 'saruman is a wizard,' answered treebeard. 'more than that i cannot say. i do not know the history of wizards. they appeared first after the great ships came over the sea; but if they came with the ships i never can tell. saruman was reckoned great among them, i believe. he gave up wandering about and minding the affairs of men and elves, some time ago - you would call it a very long time ago: and he settled down at angrenost, or isengard as the men of

 vessels of light trembled and sent up two jets of flame. there was a flicker like green fire in his eyes, and his beard stood out stiff as a great besom.
'i will stop it!' he boomed. 'and you shall come with me. you may be able to help me. you will be helping your own friends that way, too; for if saruman is not checked rohan and gondor will have an enemy behind as well as in front. our roads go together - to isengard!'
'we will come with you,' said merry. 'we will do what we can.'
'yes!' said pippin. 'i should like to see the white hand overthrown. i should like to be there, even if i could not be of much use: i shall never forget uglúk and the crossing of rohan.'
'good! good!' said treebeard. 'but i spoke hastily. we must not be hasty. i have become too hot. i must cool myself and think; fur it is easier to shout stop! than to do it.'

 trouble has been. he was wounded by the orcs, and many of his folk and his tree-herds have been murdered and destroyed. he has gone up into the high places, among the birches that he loves best, and he will not come down. still, i daresay i could get together a fair company of our younger folks - if i could make them understand the need: if i could rouse them: we are not a hasty folk. what a pity there are so few of us!'
'why are there so few when you have lived in this country so long?' asked pippin. 'have a great many died?'
'oh, no!' said treebeard. 'none have died from inside, as you might say. some have fallen in the evil chances of the long years, of course: and more have grown tree-ish. but there were never many of us and we have not increased. there have been no entings - no children, you would say, not for a terrible long count of years. you see, we lost the entwives.'
'how very sad!' said pippin. 'how was it that they all died?'
'they did not die!' said treebeard. 'i never said di

'we usually lie down to sleep,' said merry. 'we shall be all right where we are.'
'lie down to sleep!' said treebeard. 'why of course you do! hm, hoom: i was forgetting: singing that song put me in mind of old times; almost thought that i was talking to young entings, i did. well, you can lie on the bed. i am going to stand in the rain. good night!'
merry and pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass and fern. it was fresh, and sweet-scented, and warm. the lights died down, and the glow of the trees faded; but outside under the arch they could see old treebeard standing, motionless, with his arms raised above his head. the bright stars peered out of the sky, and lit the falling water as it spilled on to his fingers and head, and dripped, dripped, in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet. listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbi

ts fell asleep.
they woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court, and on to the floor of the bay. shreds of high cloud were overhead, running on a stiff easterly wind. treebeard was not to be seen; but while merry and pippin were bathing in the basin by the arch, they heard him humming and singing, as he came up the path between the trees.
'hoo, ho! good morning, merry and pippin!' he boomed, when he saw them. 'you sleep long. i have been many a hundred strides already today. now we will have a drink, and go to entmoot.'
he poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar; but from a different jar. the taste was not the same as it had been the night before: it was earthier and richer, more sustaining and food-like, so to speak. while the hobbits drank, sitting on the edge of the bed, and nibbling small pieces of elf-cake (more because they felt that eating was a necessar

y part of breakfast than because they felt hungry), treebeard stood, humming in entish or elvish or some strange tongue, and looking up at the sky.
'where is entmoot?' pippin ventured to ask.
'hoo, eh? entmoot?' said treebeard, turning round. 'it is not a place, it is a gathering of ents - which does not often happen nowadays. but i have managed to make a fair number promise to come. we shall meet in the place where we have always met: derndingle men call it. it is away south from here. we must be there before noon.'
before long they set off. treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as on the previous day. at the entrance to the court he turned to the right, steppe

ove these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods. soon treebeard turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves, where the trees were larger, taller, and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before. for a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first ventured into fangorn, but it soon passed. treebeard did not talk to them. he hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully, but merry and pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar boom, and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. now and again they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of the earth, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of the trees; but treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side.
they had been going for a long while - pippin had tried to keep count of the 'ent-str

ides' but had failed, getting lost at about three thousand - when treebeard began to slacken his pace. suddenly he stopped, put the hobbits down, and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a hollow tube; then he blew or called through them. a great hoom, hom rang out like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. far off there came from several directions a similar hoom, hom, hoom that was not an echo but an answer.
treebeard now perched merry and pippin on his shoulders and strode on again, every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the answers came louder and nearer. in this way they came at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the hobbits had never seen before: they branched out right from the roots, and were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff upright flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.

tory; and some as different as one tree-kind from another, as birch from beech; oak from fir. there were a few older ents, bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees (though none looked as ancient as treebeard); and there were tall strong ents, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their prime; but there were no young ents, no saplings. altogether there were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of the dingle, and as many more were marching in.
at first merry and pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from three to nine). a few seemed more or less related to treebeard, and reminded them of beech-trees or oaks. but there were other kinds. some recalled the chestnut: brown-skinned ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs. some recalled the ash: tall straight grey ents with many-fingered

 same green flicker.
as soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation began. the ents began to murmur slowly: first one joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one side of the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom on the other side. though he could not catch or understand any of the words - he supposed the language was entish - pippin found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first; but gradually his attention wavered. after a long time (and the chant showed no signs of slackening) he found himself wondering, since entish was such an 'unhasty' language, whether they had yet got further than good morning; and if treebeard was to call the roll, how many days it would take to sing all their names. 'i wonder what the entish is for yes or no,' he thought. he yawned.
treebeard was immediately aware of him. 'hm, ha, hey, my pip

roll about in the dingle, if you like. there is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away yonder in the north bank. there are still some words to speak before the moot really begins. i will come and see you again, and tell you how things are going.'
he put the hobbits down. before they walked away, they bowed low. this feat seemed to amuse the ents very much, to judge by the tone of their murmurs, and the flicker of their eyes; but they soon turned back to their own business. merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in from the west, and looked through the opening in the great hedge. long tree-clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle, and away beyond them, above the fir-trees of the furthest ridge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of a high mountain. southwards to their left they could see the forest falling away down into the grey distance. there far away there was a pale green glimmer that merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of rohan.
'i wonder where isengard

is?' said pippin.
'i don't know quite where we are,' said merry; 'but that peak is probably methedras, and as far as i can remember the ring of isengard lies in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains. it is probably down behind this great ridge. there seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left of the peak, don't you think?'
'what is isengard like?' said pippin. 'i wonder what ents can do about it anyway.'
'so do i,' said merry. 'isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills, i think, with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in the middle, called orthanc. saruman has a tower on it. there is a gate, perhaps more than one, in the encircling wall, and i believe there is a stream running through it; it comes out of the mountains, and flows on across the gap of rohan. it does not seem the sort of place for ents to tackle. but i have an odd f

eeling about these ents: somehow i don't think they are quite as safe and, well funny as they seem. they seem slow, queer, and patient, almost sad; and yet i believe they could be roused. if that happened, i would rather not be on the other side.'
'yes!' said pippin. 'i know what you mean. there might be all the difference between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing, and a bull charging; and the change might come suddenly. i wonder if treebeard will rouse them. i am sure he means to try. but they don't like being roused. treebeard got roused himself last night, and then bottled it up again.'
the hobbits turned back. the voices of the ents were still rising and falling in their conclave. the sun had now risen high enough to look over the high hedge:

ning, swung into the line beside treebeard. the old ent now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders again, and so they rode proudly at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads held high. though they had expected something to happen eventually, they were amazed at the change that had come over the ents. it seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike.
'the ents made up their minds rather quickly, after all, didn't they?' pippin ventured to say after some time, when for a moment the singing paused, and only the beating of hands and feet was heard.
'quickly?' said treebeard. 'hoom! yes, indeed. quicker than i expected. indeed i have not seen them roused like this for many an age. we ents do not like being roused; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our trees and our lives are in great danger. that has not happened in this forest since the wars of sauron and the men of the sea. it is the orc-work, the w

 by many lives of trees. they are all roused now, and their mind is all on one thing: breaking isengard. but they will start thinking again before long; they will cool down a little, when we take our evening drink. what a thirst we shall have! but let them march now and sing! we have a long way to go, and there is time ahead for thought. it is something to have started.'
treebeard marched on, singing with the others for a while. but after a time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again. pippin could see that his old brow was wrinkled and knotted. at last he looked up, and pippin could see a sad look in his eyes, sad but not unhappy. there was a light in them, as if the green flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought.
'of course, it is likely enough, my friends,' he said slowly, 'likely enough that we are going to our doom: the last march of the ents. but if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. that thought has long been growing

y friends, songs like trees bear fruit only in their own time and their own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely.'
the ents went striding on at a great pace. they had descended into a long fold of the land that fell away southward; now they began to climb up, and up, on to the high western ridge. the woods fell away and they came to scattered groups of birch, and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine-trees grew. the sun sank behind the dark hill-back in front. grey dusk fell.
pippin looked behind. the number of the ents had grown - or what was happening? where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie, he thought he saw groves of trees. but they were moving! could it be that the trees of fangorn were awake, and the forest was rising, marching over the hills to war? he rubbed his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived him; but the great grey shapes moved steadily onward. there was a noise like wind in many branches. the ents were drawing near the crest o

ed to the fire. but the hobbit was not seen: he was not "in the open", for it was night and he still had his elven-cloak. he was exhausted and hungry, and it is not to be wondered at that, when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen enemy, he rested and ate a little before he crept away. but it is a comfort to know that he had some lembas in his pocket, even though he ran away without gear or pack; that, perhaps, is like a hobbit. i say he, though i hope and guess that both merry and pippin were here together. there is, however, nothing to show that for certain.'
'and how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free?' asked gimli.
'i do not know how it happened,' answered aragorn. 'nor do i know why an orc was carrying them away. not to help them to escape, we may be sure. nay, rather i think that i now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why when boromir had fallen were the orcs content with the capture of merry and pippin? t

r which they stood. 'i do not wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready to hand, that is all. let us go!'
with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn. legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn. there was little for him to see. the floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks of the stream. so it was that he came upon the place where merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet. there plain for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other.
'this is good tidings,' said aragorn. 'yet the marks are two days old and it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water-side.'
'then what shall we do now?' said gimli. 'we cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fangorn. we have come ill supplied. if we do not find them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and show

ve endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of isengard. even reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong. he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their help from minas tirith, even as the main blow is approaching from the east. yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand. saruman also had a mind to capture the ring, for himself, or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes. so between them our enemies have contrived only to bring merry and pippin with marvellous speed, and in the nick of time, to fangorn, where otherwise they would never have come at all!
'also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their plans. no tidings of the battle will come to mordor, thanks to the horsemen of rohan; but the dark lord knows that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and borne away towards isengard against the will of his own servants. he now has isengard to fear as well as minas tirith. if minas tirith falls, it will go ill wit

n! but treebeard: that is only a rendering of fangorn into the common speech; yet you seem to speak of a person. who is this treebeard?'
'ah! now you are asking much,' said gandalf. 'the little that i know of his long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now. treebeard is fangorn, the guardian of the forest; he is the oldest of the ents, the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the sun upon this middle-earth. i hope indeed, legolas, that you may yet meet him. merry and pippin have been fortunate: they met him here, even where we sit. for he came here two days ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains. he often comes here, especially when his mind is uneasy, and rumours of the world outside trouble him. i saw him four days ago striding among the trees, and i think he saw me, for he paused; but i did not speak, for i was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle with the eye of mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my n

'you speak for me, gimli,' laughed legolas. 'though i would sooner learn how they came by the wine.'
'one thing you have not found in your hunting, and that's brighter wits,' said pippin, opening an eye. 'here you find us sitting on a field of victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned comforts!'
'well-earned?' said gimli. 'i cannot believe that!'
the riders laughed. 'it cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting of dear friends,' said théoden. 'so these are the lost ones of your company, gandalf? the days are fated to be filled with marvels. already i have seen many since i left my house; and now here before my eyes stand yet anoth

'hobbits, if you please, lord,' said pippin.
'hobbits?' said théoden. 'your tongue is strangely changed; but the name sounds not unfitting so. hobbits! no report that i have heard does justice to the truth.'
merry bowed; and pippin got up and bowed low. 'you are gracious, lord; or i hope that i may so take your words,' he said. 'and here is another marvel! i have wandered in many lands, since i left my home, and never till now have i found people that knew any story concerning hobbits.'
'my people came out of the north long ago,' said théoden. 'but i will not deceive you: we know no tales about hobbits. all that is said among us is that far away, over many hills and rivers, live the halfling folk that dwell in holes in s

the hobbits bowed low. 'so that is the king of rohan!' said pippin in an undertone. 'a fine old fellow. very polite.'

chapter 9

flotsam and jetsam

gandalf and the king's company rode away, turning eastward to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard. but aragorn, gimli, and legolas remained behind. leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass, they came and sat beside the hobbits.
'well, well! the hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where none of us ever thought to come,' said aragorn.
'and now that the great ones have gone to discuss h

'all in good time,' said legolas. 'we were the hunters, and you should give an account of yourselves to us first.'
'or second,' said gimli. 'it would go better after a meal. t have a sore head; and it is past mid-day. you truants might make amends by finding us some of the plunder that you spoke of. food and drink would pay off some of my score against you.'
'then you shall have it,' said pippin. 'will you have it here, or in more comfort in what's left of saruman's guard-house--over there under the arch? we had to picnic out here, so as to keep an eye on the road.'
'less than an eye!' said gimli. 'but i will not go into any orc-house nor touch orcs' meat or anything that they have mauled.'
'we wouldn't ask you to,' said merry. 'we have had enough of orcs ourselves to last a life-time. but there were many other folk in isengard. saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs. he had

the hobbits led the way; and they passed under the arch and came to a wide door upon the left, at the top of a stair. it opened direct into a large chamber, with other smaller doors at the far end, and a hearth and chimney at one side. the chamber was hewn out of the stone; and it must once have been dark, for its windows looked out only into the tunnel. but light came in now through the broken roof. on the hearth wood was burning.
'i lit a bit of fire,' said pippin. 'it cheered us up in the fogs. there were few faggots about, and most of the wood we could find was wet. but there is a great draught in the chimney: it seems to wind away up through the rock, and fortunately it has not been blocked. a fire is handy. i will make you some toast. the bread is three or four days old, i am afraid.'
aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long table, and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors. 'store-room in there, and above t

'and you need not turn up your nose at the provender, master gimli,' said merry. 'this is not orc-stuff, but man-food, as treebeard calls it. will you have wine or beer? there's a barrel inside there - very passable. and this is first-rate salted pork. or i can cut you some rashers of bacon and broil them, if you like. i am sorry there is no green stuff: the deliveries have been rather interrupted in the last

'indeed yes,' said gimli. 'the score is much reduced.'
the three were soon busy with their meal; and the two hobbits, unabashed, set to a second time. 'we must keep our guests company,' they said.
'you are full of courtesy this morning,' laughed legolas. 'but maybe. if we had not arrived, you would already have been keeping one another company again.'
'maybe; and why not?' said pippin. 'we had foul fare with the orcs, and little enough for days before that. it seems a long while since we could eat to heart's content.'
'it does not seem to have done you any harm,' said aragorn. 'indeed you look in the bloom of health.'
'aye, you do indeed,' said gimli, looking them up and down over the top of his cup. 'why, your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted; and i would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for hobbits of your age. this treebeard a

'you have drunk of the waters of the ents, have you?' said legolas. 'ah, then i think it is likely that gimli's eyes do not deceive him. strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn.'
'many strange tales have been told about that land,' said aragorn. 'i have never entered it. come, tell me more about it, and about the ents!'
'ents,' said pippin, 'ents are - well ents are all different for on thing. but their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.' he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence. 'oh, well,' he went on, 'you have seen some at a distance, already-they saw you at any rate, and reported that you were on the way-and you will see many others, i expect, before you leave here. you must form your own ideas.'
'now, now!' said gimli. 'we are beginning the story in the middle. i should like a tale in the right order, star

'you shall have it, if there is time,' said merry. 'but first-if you have finished eating-you shall fill your pipes and light up. and then for a little while we can pretend that we are all back safe at bree again, or in rivendell.'
he produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. 'we have heaps of it,' he said; 'and you can all pack as much as you wish, when we go. we did some salvage-work this morning, pippin and i. there are lots of things floating about. it was pippin who found two small barrels, washed up out of some cellar or store-house, i suppose. when we opened them, we found they were filled with this: as fine a pipe-weed as you could wish for, and quite unspoilt.'
gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it. 'it feels good, and it smells good,' he said.
'it is good!' said merry. 'my dear gimli, it is longbottom leaf! there were the hornblower brandmarks on the barrels, as plai

went so far abroad. but it comes in handy now?'
'it would,' said gimli, 'if i had a pipe to go with it. alas, i lost mine in moria, or before. is there no pipe in all your plunder?'
'no, i am afraid not,' said merry. 'we have not found any, not even here in the guardrooms. saruman kept this dainty to himself. it seems. and i don't think it would be any use knocking on the doors of orthanc to beg a pipe of him! we shall have to share pipes. as good friends must at a pinch.'
'half a moment!' said pippin. putting his hand inside the breast of his jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string. 'i keep a treasure or two near my skin, as precious as rings to me. here's one: my old wooden pipe. and here's another: an unused one. i have carried it a long way,, though i don't know why. i never really expected to find any pipe-weed on the journey, when my own ran out. but now it comes in useful after all.' he held up a small pipe with a wide flattened bowl, and handed it to gimli.

'now let us take our ease here for a little!' said aragorn. 'we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk, as gandalf says, while he is busy elsewhere. i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt before.' he wrapped his grey cloak about him, hiding his mail-shirt, and stretched out his long legs. then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke.
'look!' said pippin. 'strider the ranger has come back!'
'he has never been away,' said aragorn. 'i am strider and dúnadan too, and i belong both to gondor and the north.'
they smoked in silence for a while, and the sun shone on them; slanting into the valley from among white clouds high in the west. legolas lay still, looking up at the sun and sky with steady eyes, and singing softly to himself. at last he sat up. 'come now!' he said. 'time wears on, and the mists are blowing away, or would if you strange folk d

'well, my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all strung-up in an orc-camp,' said pippin. 'let me see, what is today?'
'the fifth of march in the shire-reckoning,' said aragorn. pippin made some calculations on his fingers. 'only nine days ago!' he said.1 'it seems a year since we were caught. well, though half of it was like a bad dream, i reckon that three very horrible days followed. merry will correct me, if i forget anything important: i am not going into details: the whips and the filth and stench and all that; it does not bear remembering.' with that he plunged into an account of boromir's last fight and the orc-march from emyn muil to the forest. the others nodded as

the various points were fitted in with their guesses.
'here are some treasures that you let fall,' said aragorn. 'you will be glad to have them back.' he loosened his belt from under his cloak and took from it the two sheathed knives.
'well!' said merry. 'i never expected to see those again! i marked a few orcs with mine; but uglúk took them from us. how he glared! at first i thought he was going to stab me, but he threw the things away as if they burned him.'
'and here also is your brooch, pippin,' said aragorn. 'i have kept it safe, for it is a very precious thing.'
'i know,' said pippin. 'it was a wrench to let it go; but what else could i do?'
'nothing else,' answered aragorn. 'one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters. you did rightly.'
'the cutting of the bands on your wrists, that was smart work!' said gimli. 'luck served you there; but you seized your chance with both hands, one might say.'
'and set us a pretty riddle,' said legolas. 'i wondered if you had grown w

'unfortunately not,' said pippin. 'but you did not know about grishnákh.' he shuddered and said no more, leaving merry to tell of those last horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful strength of grishnákh's hairy arms.
'all this about the orcs of barad-dûr, lugbúrz as they call it, makes me uneasy,' said aragorn. 'the dark lord already knew too much and his servants also; and grishnákh evidently sent some message across the river after the quarrel. the red eye will be looking towards isengard. b

ut saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.'
'yes, whichever side wins, his outlook is poor,' said merry. 'things began to go all wrong for him from the moment his orcs set foot in rohan.'
'we caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so gandalf hints,' said gimli. 'on the edge of the forest.'
'when was that?' asked pippin.
'five nights ago,' said aragorn.
'let me see,' said merry: 'five nights ago-now we come to a part of the story you know nothing about. we met treebeard that morning after the battle; and that night we were at wellinghall, one of his ent-houses. the next morning we went to entmoot, a gathering of ents, that is, and the queerest thing i have ever seen in my life. it lasted all that day and the next; and we spent the nights with an ent called quickbeam. and then late in the afternoon in the third

'if saruman had heard it, he would be a hundred miles away by now, even if he had had to run on his own legs,' said pippin.
'though isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone,
we go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door!
there was very much more. a great deal of the song had no words, and was like a music of horns and drums. it was very exciting. but i thought it was only marching music and no more, just a song - until i got here. i know better now.'

'it was the huorns, or so the ents call them in "short language". treebeard won't say much about them, but i think they are ents that have become almost like trees, at least to look at. they stand here and there in the wood or under its eaves, silent, watching endlessly over the trees; but deep in the darkest dales there are hundreds and hundreds of them, i believe.

full of creaking. it was very dark, a cloudy night. they moved at a great speed as soon as they had left the hills, and made a noise like a rushing wind. the moon did not appear through the clouds, and not long after midnight there was a tall wood all round the north side of isengard. there was no sign of enemies nor of any challenge. there was a light gleaming from a high window in the tower, that was all.
'treebeard and a few more ents crept on, right round to within sight of the great gates. pippin and i were with him. we were sitting on treebeard's shoulders, and i could feel the quivering tenseness in him. but even when they are roused, ents can be very cautious and patient. they stood still as carved stones, breathing and listening.
'then all at once there was a tremendous stir. trumpets blared and the walls of isengard echoed. we thought that we had been discovered, and that battle was going to begin. but nothing of the sort. all saruman's people were marching away. i don't know much

'the ents are safe,' said pippin. 'he seems at one time to have got round them, but never again. and anyway he did not understand them; and he made the great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations. he had no plan for them, and there was no time to make any, once they had set to work. as soon as our attack began, the few remaining rats in isengard started bolting through every hole that the ents made. the ents let the men go, after they had questioned them, two or three dozen only down at this end. i don't think many o

'there was no need. he halted just by us and looked down at us.

'treebeard heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once; and there was a strange meeting. i was surprised, because neither of them seemed surprised at all. gandalf obviously expected to find treebeard here; and treebeard might almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose to meet him. yet we had told the old en

 explosions and gusts of fire. one great coil of vapour went whirling up, twisting round and round orthanc, until it looked like a tall peak of cloud, fiery underneath and moonlit above. and still more water poured in, until at last isengard looked like a huge flat saucepan, all steaming and bubbling.'
'we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we came to the mouth of nan curunír,' said aragorn. 'we feared that saruman was brewing some new devilry for us.'
'not he!' said pippin. 'he was probably choking and not laughing any more. by the morning, yesterday morning, the water had sunk down into all the holes, and there was a dense fog. we took refuge in that guardroom over there; and we had rather a fright. the lake began to overflow and pour out through the old tunnel, and the water was rapidly rising up the steps. we thought we were going to get caught like orcs in a hole; but we found a winding stair at the back of the store-room that brought us out on top of the arc

isty, moisty morning when we climbed down and looked round again, and nobody was about. and that is about all there is to tell. it seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoil. and safer too, somehow, since gandalf came back. i could sleep!'
they all fell silent for a while. gimli re-filled his pipe. 'there is one thing i wonder about,' he said as he lit it with his flint and tinder: 'wormtongue. you told théoden he was with saruman. how did he get there?'
'oh yes, i forgot about him,' said pippin. 'he did not get here till this morning. we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared again. we heard him hooming and calling our names outside.
'"i have just come round to see how you are faring, my lads,' he said; 'and to give you some news. huorns have come back. all's well; aye very well indeed!" he laughed, and slapped his thighs.

'"what about drink?" i said to the ents.
'"there is water of isen," they said, "and that is good enough for ents and men." but i hope that the ents may have found time to brew some of their draughts from the mountain-springs, and we shall see gandalf's beard curling when he returns. after the ents had gone, we felt tired, and hungry. but we did not grumble - our labours had been well rewarded. it was through our search for man-food that pippin discovered the prize of all the flotsam, those hornblower barrels. "pipe-weed is better after food," said pippin; that is how the situation arose.'
'we understand it all perfectly now,' said gimli.
'all except one thing,' said aragorn: 'leaf from the southfarthing in isengard. the more i consider it, the more curious i find it. i have never been in isengard, but i have journeyed in this land, and i know well the empty countries that lie between rohan and the shire. neither goods nor folk have p

assed that way for many a long year, not openly. saruman had secret dealings with someone in the shire, i guess. wormtongues may be found in other houses than king théoden's. was there a date on the barrels?'
'yes,' said pippin. 'it was the 1417 crop, that is last year's; no, the year before, of course, now: a good year.'
'ah well, whatever evil was afoot is over now, i hope; or else it is beyond our reach at present,' said aragorn. 'yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf, small matter though it may seem among his great affairs.'

'and how will you learn that, master dwarf?' said gandalf. 'saruman could look like me in your eyes, if it suited his purpose with you. and are you yet wise enough to detect all his counterfeits? well, we shall see, perhaps. he may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes together. but i have ordered all the ents to remove themselves from sight, so perhaps we shall persuade him to come out.'
'what's the danger?' asked pippin. 'will he shoot at us, and pour fire out of the windows; or can he put a spell on us from a distance?'
'the last is most likely, if you ride to his door with a light heart,' said gandalf. 'but there is no knowing what he can do, or may choose to try. a wild beast cornered is not safe to approach. and saruman has powers you do not guess. beware of his voice!'
they came now to the foot of orthanc. it was black, and the rock gleamed as if it were wet. the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as

'nay!' said gimli. 'legolas and i wish for a closer view. we alone here represent our kindred. we also will come behind.'
'come then!' said gandalf, and with that he climbed the steps, and théoden went beside him.
the riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses, on either side of the stair, and looked up darkly at the great tower, fearing what might befall their lord. merry and pippin sat on the bottom step, feeling both unimportant and unsafe.
'half a sticky mile from here to the gate!' muttered pippin. 'i wish i could slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed! what did we come for? we are not wanted.'
gandalf stood before the door of orthanc and beat on it with his staff. it rang with a hollow sound. 'saruman, saruman!' he cried in a loud commanding voice. 'saruman come forth!'
for some time there was no answer. at last the window above the door was unbarred, hut no figure

'go!' said gandalf. with a cry saruman fell back and crawled away. at that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above. it glanced off the iron rail, even as saruman left it, and passing close to gandalf's head, it smote the stair on which he stood. the rail rang and snapped. the stair cracked and splintered in glittering sparks. but the ball was unharmed: it rolled on down the steps, a globe of crystal, dark, but glowing with a heart of fire. as it bounded away towards a pool pippin ran after it and picked it up.
'the murderous rogue!' cried éomer. but gandalf was unmoved. no, that was not thrown b saruman, he said; nor even at his bidding, i think. it came from a window far above. a parting shot from master wormtongue, i fancy, but ill aimed.'
'the aim was poor, maybe, because he could not make up his mind which he hated more, you or saruman,' said aragorn.
'that may be so,' said gandalf. 'small comfort will those two have in their companionship: they will gnaw one anoth

'here, my lad, i'll take that! i did not ask you to handle it,' he cried, turning sharply and seeing pippin coming up the steps, slowly, as if he were bearing a great weight. he went down to meet him and hastily took the dark globe from the hobbit, wrapping it in the folds of his cloak. 'i will take care of this,' he said. 'it is not a thing, i guess, that saruman would have chosen to cast away.'
'but he may have other things to cast,' said gimli. 'if that is the end of the debate, let us go out of stone's throw, at least!'
'it is the end,' said gandalf. 'let us go.'

'and what if sauron does not conquer? what will you do to him?' asked pippin.
'i? nothing!' said gandalf. 'i will do nothing to him. i do not wish for mastery. what w ill become of him? i cannot say. i grieve that so much that was good now festers in the tower. still for us things have not gone badly. strange are the turns of fortune! often does hatred hurt itself! i guess that, even if we had entered in, we could have found few treasures in orthanc more precious than the thing which wormtongue threw down at us.'
a shrill shriek; suddenly cut off, came from an open wind

'we will!' said merry and pippin together, and they turned away hastily. treebeard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking his head thoughtfully. then he turned to gandalf.
'so saruman would not leave?' he said. 'i did not think he would. his heart is as rotten as a black huorn's. still, if i were overcome and all my trees destroyed, i would not come while i had one dark hole left to hide in.'
'no,' said gandalf. 'but you have not plotted to cover all the world with your trees and choke all other living things. but

the palantír
the sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when gandalf and his companions, and the king with his riders, set out again from isengard. gandalf took merry behind him, and aragorn took pippin. two of the king's men went on ahead, riding swiftly, and passed soon out of sight down into the valley. the others followed at an easy pace.
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long arms uplifted, but they made no sound. merry and pippin looked back, when they had passed some way down the winding road. sunlight was still shining in the sky, but long shadows reached over isengard: grey ruins falling into darkness. treebeard stood alone there now, like the distant stu

they rode on, and evening deepened in the valley.
'are we riding far tonight, gandalf?' asked merry after a while. 'i don't know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you; but the rag-tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.'
'so you heard that?' said gandalf. 'don't let it rankle! be thankful no longer words were aimed at you. he had his eyes on you. if it is any comfort to your pride, i should say that, at the moment, you and pippin are more in his thoughts than all the rest of us. who you are; how you came there, and why; what you know; whether you were captured, and if so, how you escaped when all the orcs perished - it is with those little riddles that the great mind of saruman is troubled. a sneer from him, meriadoc, is a compliment, if you feel honoured by his concern.'
'thank you!' said merry. 'but it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail, gandalf. for one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a qu

 grew thick upon the low banks, and under them they made their camp, two hours or so before the middle of the night. they lit a fire in a hollow, down among the roots of a spreading hawthorn, tall as a tree, writhen with age; but hale in every limb. buds were swelling at each twig's tip.
guards were set, two at a watch. the rest, after they had supped, wrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept. the hobbits lay in a corner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken. merry was sleepy, but pippin now seemed curiously restless. the bracken cracked and rustled, as he twisted and turned.
'what's the matter?' asked merry. 'are you lying on an ant-hill?'
'no,' said pippin, 'but i'm not comfortable. i wonder how long it is since i slept in a bed?'
merry yawned. 'work it out on your fingers!' he said. 'but you must know how long it is since we left lórien.'
'oh, that!' said pippin. 'i mean a real bed in a bedroom.'
'well, rivendell then,' said merry. 'but i could sleep anywhere tonight.'

'well, what of it?'
'did you get any news, any information out of him?'
'yes, a good deal. more than usual. but you heard it all or most of it: you were close by, and we were talking no secrets. but you can go with him tomorrow, if you think you can get more out of him-and if he'll have you.'
'can i? good! but he's close, isn't he? not changed at all.'
'oh yes, he is!' said merry, waking up a little, and beginning to wonder what was bo

 merrier and more solemn than before, i think. he has changed; but we have not had a chance to see how much, yet. but think of the last part of that business with saruman! remember saruman was once gandalf's superior: head of the council, whatever that may be exactly. he was saruman the white. gandalf is the white now. saruman came when he was told, and his rod was taken; and then he was just told to go, and he went!'
'well, if gandalf has changed at all, then he's closer than ever that's all,' pippin argued. 'that-glass ball, now. he seemed mighty pleased with it. he knows or guesses something about it. but does he tell us what? no, not a word. yet i picked it up, and i saved it from rolling into a pool. here, i'll take that, my lad - that's all. i wonder what it is? it felt so very heavy.' pippin's voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself.
'hullo!' said merry. 'so that's what is bothering you? now, pippin my lad, don't forget gildor's saying - the one sam used to quote: do not m

'but our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the affairs of wizards,' said pippin. 'i should like a bit of information as well as danger. i should like a look at that ball.'
'go to sleep!' said merry. 'you'll get information enough, sooner or later. my dear pippin, no took ever beat a brandybuck for inquisitiveness; but is this the time, i ask you?'
'all right! what's the harm in my telling you what i should like: a look at that stone? i know i can't have it, with old gandalf sitting on it, like a hen on an egg. but it doesn't help much to get no more from you than a you-can't-have-it so-go-to-sleep!'
'well, what else could i say?' said merry. 'i'm sorry, pippin, but you really must wait till the morning. i'll be as curious as you like after breakfast, a

pippin said no more. he lay still now, but sleep remained far away; and it was not encouraged by the sound of merry breathing softly, asleep in a few minutes after saying good night. 'the thought of the dark globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew quiet. pippin felt again its weight in his hands, and saw again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for a moment. he tossed and turned and tried to think of something else.
at last he could stand it no longer. he got up and looked round. it was chilly, and he wrapped his cloak about him. the moon was shining cold and white, down into the dell, and the shadows of the bushes were black. all about lay sleeping shapes. the two guards were not in view: they were up on the hill, perhaps, or hidden i

n the bracken. driven by some impulse that he did not understand, pippin walked softly to where gandalf lay. he looked down at him. the wizard seemed asleep, but with lids not fully closed: there was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes. pippin stepped back hastily. but gandalf made no sign; and drawn forward once more, half against his will, the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizard's head. he was rolled in a blanket, with his cloak spread over the top; and close beside him, between his right side and his bent arm, there was a hummock, something round wrapped in a dark cloth; his hand seemed only just to have slipped off it to the ground.
hardly breathing, pippin crept nearer, foot by foot. at last he knelt down. then he put h

f oddments, perhaps, after all,' he thought with a strange sense of relief; but he did not put the bundle down again. he stood for a moment clasping it. then an idea came into his mind. he tiptoed away, found a large stone, and came back.
quickly now he drew off the cloth, wrapped the stone in it and kneeling down, laid it back by the wizard's hand. then at last he looked at the thing that he had uncovered. there it was: a smooth globe of crystal, now dark and dead, lying bare before his knees. pippin lifted it, covered it hurriedly in his own cloak, and half turned to go back to his bed. at that moment gandalf moved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange tongue; his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone, then he sighed and did not move again.
'you idiotic fool!' pippin muttered to himself. 'you're going to get yourself into frightful trouble. put it back quick!' but he found now that his knees quaked, and he did not dare to go near enough to the wizard

 to reach the bundle. 'i'll never get it back now without waking him,' he thought, 'not till i'm a bit calmer. so i may as well have a look first. not just here though!' he stole away, and sat down on a green hillock not far from his bed. the moon looked in over the edge of the dell.
pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them. he bent low over it, looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food, in a corner away from others. he drew his cloak aside and gazed at it. the air seemed still and tense about him. at first the globe was dark, black as jet, with the moonlight gleaming on its surface. then there came a faint glow and stir in the heart of it, and it held his eyes, so that now he could not look away. soon all the inside seemed on fire; the ball was

spinning, or the lights within were revolving. suddenly the lights went out. he gave a gasp and struggled; but he remained bent, clasping the ball with both hands. closer and closer he bent, and then became rigid; his lips moved soundlessly for a while. then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still.
the cry was piercing. the guards leapt down from the banks. all the camp was soon astir.
'so this is the thief!' said gandalf. hastily he cast his cloak over the globe where it lay. 'but you, pippin! this is a grievous turn to things!' he knelt by pippin's body: the hobbit was lying on his back rigid, with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky. 'the devilry! what mischief has he done-to himself, and to all of us?' the wizard's face was drawn and haggard.
he took pippin's hand and bent over his face, listening for his breath; then he laid his hands on his brow. the hobbit shuddered. his eyes closed. he cried out; and sat up. staring in bewilderment at all the faces round him, pale in the moon

not for you, saruman!' he cried in a shrill and toneless voice shrinking away from gandalf. 'i will send for it at once. do you understand? say just that!' then he struggled to get up and escape but gandalf held him gently and firmly.
'peregrin took!' he said. 'come back!'
the hobbit relaxed and fell back, clinging to the wizard's hand. 'gandalf!' he cried. 'gandalf! forgive me!'
'forgive you?' said the wizard. 'tell me first what you have done!'
'i, i took the ball and looked at it,' stammered pippin; 'and i saw things that frightened me. and i wanted to go away, but i couldn't. and then he came and questioned me; and he looked at me, and, and that is all i remember.'
'that won't do,' said gandalf sternly. 'what did you see, and what did you say?'
pippin shut his eyes and shivered, but said nothing. they all stared at him in silence, except merry who turned away. but gandalf's face was still hard. 'speak!' he said.
in a low hesitating voice pippin began again, and slowly his words grew clea

it hurt me horribly; and he pressed me, so i said: "a hobbit."
'then suddenly he seemed to see me, and he laughed at me. it was cruel. it was like being stabbed with knives. i struggled. but he said: "wait a moment! we shall meet again soon. tell saruman that this dainty is not for him. i will send for it at once. do you understand? say just that!"
'then he gloated over me. i felt i was falling to pieces. no, no! i can't say any more. i don't remember anything else.'
'look at me!' said gandalf.
pippin looked up straight into his eyes. the wizard held his gaze for a moment in silence. then his face grew gentler, and the shadow of a smile appeared. he laid his hand softly on pippin's head.
'all right!' he said. 'say no more! you have taken no harm. there is no lie in your eyes, as i feared. but he did not speak long with you. a fool, but an honest fool, you remain, peregrin took. wiser ones might have done worse in such a pass. but mark this! you have been saved, and all your friends too, main

nnot count on it a second time. if he had questioned you, then and there, almost certainly you would have told all that you know, to the ruin of us all. but he was too eager. he did not want information only: he wanted you, quickly, so that he could deal with you in the dark tower, slowly. don't shudder! if you will meddle in the affairs of wizards, you must be prepared to think of such things. but come! i forgive you. be comforted! things have not turned out as evilly as they might.'
he lifted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed. merry followed, and sat down beside him. lie there and rest, if you can, pippin!' said gandalf. 'trust me. if you feel an itch in your palms again, tell me of it! such things can be cured. but anyway, my dear hobbit, don't put a lump of rock under my elbow again! now, i will leave you two together for a while.'

xpected,' he said. 'we have had a narrow escape!'
'how is the hobbit, pippin?' asked aragorn.
'i think all will be well now,' answered gandalf. 'he was not held long, and hobbits have an amazing power of recovery. the memory, or the horror of it, will probably fade quickly. too quickly, perhaps. will you, aragorn, take the orthanc-stone and guard it? it is a dangerous charge.'
'dangerous indeed, but not to all,' said aragorn. 'there is one who may claim it by right. for this assuredly is the palantír of orthanc from the treasury of elendil, set here by the kings of gon

they stood up, rigid as stones. gandalf was gazing up, his arms out and downwards, stiff, his hands clenched.
'nazgûl!' he cried. 'the messenger of mordor. the storm is coming. the nazgûl have crossed the river! ride, ride! wait not for the dawn! let not the swift wait for the slow! ride!'
he sprang away, calling shadowfax as he ran. aragorn followed him. going to pippin, gandalf picked him up in his arms. 'you shall come with me this time,' he said. 'shadowfax shall show you his paces.' then he ran to the place where he had slept. shadowfax stood there already. slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across his shoulders, the wizard leapt upon the horse's back. aragorn lifted pippin and set him in gandalf's arms, ,wrapped in cloak and blanket.
'farewell! follow fast!' cried gandalf. 'away, shadowfax!'

'a beautiful, restful night!' said merry to aragorn. 'some folk have wonderful luck. he did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride with gandalf - and there he goes! instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warning.'
'if you had been the first to lift the orthanc-stone, and not he, how would it be now?' said aragorn. 'you might have done worse. who can say? but now it is your luck to come with me, i fear. at once. go and get ready, and bring anything that pippin left behind. make haste!'
over the plains shadowfax was flying, needing no urging and no guidance. less than an hour had passed, and they had reached the fords of isen and crossed them. the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay grey behind them.
pippin was recovering. he was warm, but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing. he was with gandalf. the horror of the stone and of the hideous shadow over the moon was fading, things left behind in the mists of the mountains or in a passing

 dream. he drew a deep breath.
'i did not know you rode bare-back, gandalf,' he said. 'you haven't a saddle or a bridle!'
'i do not ride elf-fashion, except on shadowfax,' said gandalf. 'but shadowfax will have no harness. you do not ride shadowfax: he is willing to carry you-or not. if he is willing, that is enough. it is then his business to see that you remain on his back, unless you jump off into the air.'
'how fast is he going?' asked pippin. 'fast by the wind, but very smooth. and how light his footfalls are!'
'he is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop,' answered gandalf; 'but that is not fast for him. the land is rising a little here, and is more broken than it was beyond the river. but see how the white mountains are drawing near under the stars! yonder are the thrihyrne peaks like black spears. it will not be long before we reach the branching roads and come to the deeping-coomb, where the battle was fought t

wo nights ago.'
pippin was silent again for a while. he heard gandalf singing softly to himself, murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues, as the miles ran under them. at last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught the words: a few lines came clear to his ears through the rushing of the wind:
tall ships and tall kings
three times three,
what brought they from the foundered land
over the flowing sea?
seven stars and seven stones
and one white tree.
'what are you saying, gandalf?' asked pippi

'i was just running over some of the rhymes of lore in my mind ' answered the wizard. 'hobbits, i suppose, have forgotten them, even those that they ever knew.'
'no, not all,' said pippin. 'and we have many of our own, which wouldn't interest you, perhaps. but i have never heard this one. what is it about - the seven stars and seven stones?'
'about the palantíri of the kings of old,' said gandalf.
'and what are they?'
'the name meant that which looks far away. the orthanc-stone was one.'
'then it was not made, not made' - pippin hesitated - 'by the enemy?'
'no,' said gandalf. 'nor by saruman. it is beyond his art, and beyond sauron's too. the palantíri came from beyond western

'what did the men of old use them for?' asked pippin, delighted and astonished at getting answers to so many questions, and wondering how long it would last.
'to see far off, and to converse in thought with one another,' said gandalf. 'in that way they long guarded and united the realm of gondor. they set up stones at minas anor, and at minas ithil, and at orthanc in the ring of isengard. the chief and master of these was under the dome of stars at osgiliath before its ruin. the three others were far away in the north. in the house of elrond it i

'i wish i had known all this before,' said pippin. 'i had no notion of what i was doing.'
'oh yes, you had,' said gandalf. 'you knew you were behaving wrongly and foolishly; and you told yourself so, though you did not listen. i did not tell you all this before, because it is only by musing on all that has happened that i have at last understood, even as we ride together. but if i had spoken sooner, it would not have lessened your desire, or made it easier to resist. on the contrary! no, the burned hand teaches best. after that advice about fi

'it does,' said pippin. 'if all the seven stones were laid out before me now, i should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets.'
'good!' said gandalf. 'that is what i hoped.'
'but i should like to know-' pippin began.
'mercy!' cried gandalf. 'if the giving of information is to be the cure of your inquisitiveness, i shall spend all the rest of my days in answering you. what more do you want to know?'
'the names of all the stars, and of all living things, and the whole history of middle-earth and over-heaven and of the sundering seas ' laughed pippin.

'but it was not coming for me, was it?' faltered pippin. 'i mean, it didn't know that i had… '
'of course not,' said gandalf. 'it is two hundred leagues or more in straight flight from barad-dûr to orthanc, and even a nazgûl would take a few hours to fly between them. but saruman certainly looked in the stone since the orc-raid, and more of his secret thought, i do not doubt, has been read than he intended. a messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing. and after what has happened tonight another will come, i think, and swiftly. so saru

pippin made no answer, but clutched his cloak, as if a sudden chill had struck him. grey land passed under them.
'see now!' said gandalf. 'the westfold dales are opening before us. here we come back to the eastward road. the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the deeping-coomb. that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves. do not ask me about them. ask gimli, if you meet again, and for the first time you may get an answer longer than you wish. you will not see the caves yourself, not on this journe

'to minas tirith, before the seas of war surround it.'
'oh! and how far is that?'
'leagues upon leagues,' answered gandalf. 'thrice as far as the dwellings of king théoden, and they are more than a hundred miles east from here, as the messengers of mordor fly. shadowfax must run a longer road. which will prove the swifter?
'we shall ride now till daybreak, and that is some hours away. then even shadowfax must rest, in some hollow of the hills: at edoras, i hope. sl

shadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud, as if a trumpet had summoned him to battle. then he sprang forward. fire flew from his feet; night rushed over him.
as he fell slowly into sleep, pippin had a strange feeling: he and gandalf were still as stone, seated upon the statue of a running horse, while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind.

'well, master, we're in a fix and no mistake,' said sam gamgee. he stood despondently with hunched shoulders beside frodo, and peered out with puckered eyes into the gloom.
