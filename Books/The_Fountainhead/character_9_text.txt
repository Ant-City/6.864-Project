he has a future....oh, you don't think he has? you really don't think he has?"

ellsworth m. toohey, who let no stone spring from the ground of america without his 
comment, did not know that the heller house had been erected, as far as his column was 
concerned. he did not consider it necessary to inform his readers about it, if only to damn it. 
he said nothing.

12.

a column entitled "observations and meditations" by alvah scarret appeared daily on the 
front page of the new york banner. it was a trusted guide, a source of inspiration and a 
molder of public philosophy in small towns throughout the country. in this column there had 
appeared, years ago, the famous statement: "we'd all be a heap sight better off if we'd forget 
the highfalutin notions of our fancy civilization and mind more what the savages knew long 
before us: to honor our mother." alvah scarret was a bachelor, had made two millions dollars, 
played gol

it was alvah scarret who conceived the idea of the campaign against living conditions in the 
slums and "landlord sharks," which ran in the banner for three weeks. this was material 
such as alvah scarret relished. it had human appeal and social implications. it lent itself to 
sunday-supplement illustrations of girls leaping into rivers, their skirts flaring well above their 
knees. it boosted circulation. it embarrassed the sharks who owned a stretch of blocks by the 
east river, selected as the dire example of the campaign. the sharks had refused to sell 
these blocks to an obscure real-estate company; at the end of the campaign they surrendered 
and sold. no one could prove that the real-est

of his flying jacket, his hand raised with a cigarette held between two fingers that did not 
tremble. when questioned about his first wish on returning to earth, he had expressed the 
desire to kiss the most attractive woman present, had chosen the dowdiest old hag from the 
crowd and bent to kiss her gravely on the forehead, explaining that she reminded him of his 
mother.

later, at the start of the slum campaign, gail wynand had said to alvah scarret; "go ahead. 
squeeze all you can out of the thing," and had departed on his yacht for a world cruise, 
accompanied by an enchanting aviatrix of twenty-four to whom he had made a present of his 
transcontinental plane.

alvah scarret went ahead. among many other steps of his campaign he assigned dominique 
francon to investigate the condition of homes in the slums and to gather human material. 
dominique francon had just returned from a summer in biarritz; she always took a whole 
summer's vacat

ion and alvah scarret granted it, because she was one of his favorite 
employees, because he was baffled by her and because he knew that she could quit her job 
whenever she pleased.

dominique francon went to live for two weeks in the hall bedroom of an east-side tenement. 
the room had a skylight, but no windows; there were five flights of stairs to climb and no 
running water. she cooked her own meals in the kitchen of a numerous family on the floor 
below; she visited neighbors, she sat on the landings of fire e

"the block you control for the claridge estate, mr. brooks, has the most attractive stalactites 
growing on all the ceilings," she said, her golden head leaning to her corsage of white 
gardenias with drops of water sparkling on the lusterless petals.

she was asked to speak at a meeting of social workers. it was an important meeting, with a 
militant, radical mood, led by some of the most prominent women in the field. alvah scarret 
was pleased and gave her his blessing. "go to it, kid," he said, "lay it on thick. we want the 
social workers." she stood in the speaker's pulpit of an unaired hall and looked at a flat sheet 
of faces, faces lecherously eager with the sense of their own virtue. she spoke evenly, without 
inflection. she said, among many other things: "the family on the first floor rear do not bother 
to pay their rent, and the children cannot go to school for lack of clothes. the father has a 
charge account

cash. in the fourth floor front, the father of the family has not done a whole day's work in his 
life, and does not intend to. there are nine children, supported by the local parish. there is a 
tenth one on its way..." when she finished there were a few claps of angry applause. she 
raised her hand and said: "you don't have to applaud. i don't expect it." she asked politely: 
"are there any questions?" there were no questions.

when she returned home she found alvah scarret waiting for her. he looked incongruous in 
the drawing room of her penthouse, his huge bulk perched on the edge of a delicate chair, a 
hunched gargoyle against the glowing spread of the city beyond a solid wall of glass. the city 
was like a mural designed to illuminate and complete the room: the fragile lines of spires on a 
black sky continued the fragile lines of the furniture; the lights glittering in distant windows 
threw reflections on the bare, lustrous floor; the cold precision of the

 angular structures 
outside answered the cold, inflexible grace of every object within. alvah scarret broke the 
harmony. he looked like a kindly country doctor and like a cardsharp. his heavy face bore the 
benevolent, paternal smile that had always been his passkey and his trademark. he had the 
knack of making the kindliness of his smile add to, not detract from his solemn appearance of 
dignity; his long, thin, hooked nose did detract from the kindliness, but it added to the dignity; 
his stomach, cantilevered over his legs, did detract from the dignity, but it added to the 
kindliness. he

home," he said. "i've got something to tell you. how did it go, kid?"

"as i expected it."

she tore her hat off and threw it down on the first chair in sight. her hair slanted in a flat curve 
across her forehead and fell in a straight line to her shoulders; it looked smooth and tight, like 
a bathing cap of pale, polished metal. she walked to the window and stood looking out over 
the city. she asked without turning: "what did you want to tell me?"

alvah scarret watched her pleasurably. he had long since given up any attempts beyond 
holding her hand when not necessary or patting her shoulder; he had stopped thinking of the 
subject, but he had a dim, half-conscious feeling which he summed up to himself in the words: 
you never can tell.

"i've got good news for you, child," he said. "i've been working out a little scheme, just a bit of 
reorganization, and i've figured where i'll consolidate a few things together into a women's 
welfare department. yo

i am, you know, in everything but in fact....peter, you look as if you were going to blush in a 
moment, and that's very amusing."

"dominique! haven't you ever been in love at all? not even a little?"

"i haven't. i really wanted to fall in love with you. i thought it would be convenient. i'd have no 
trouble with you at all. but you see? i can't feel anything. i can't feel any difference, whether 
it's you or alvah scarret or lucius heyer."

he got up. he did not want to look at her. he walked to a window and stood, staring out, his 
hands clasped behind his back. he had forgotten his desire and her beauty, but he 
remembered now that she was francon's daughter.

"dominique, will you marry me?"

he knew he had to say it now; if he let himself think of her, he would never say it; what he felt 
for her did not matter any longer; he could not let it stand between him and his future; and 
what lie felt for her was gr

in the offices of the banner ellsworth toohey was treated respectfully and left alone. it was 
whispered that gail wynand did not like him--because wynand was always polite to him. 
alvah scarret unbent to the point of cordiality, but kept a wary distance. there was a silent, 
watchful equilibrium between toohey and scarret: they understood each other.

toohey made no attempt to approach wynand in any way. toohey seemed indifferent to all 
the men who counted on the banner. he concentrated on the others, instead.

he organized a club of wynand employees. it was not a labor union; it was just a club. it met 
once a month in the library of the banner. it did not concern itself with wages,

itions; it had no concrete program at all. people got acquainted, talked, and 
listened to speeches. ellsworth toohey made most of the speeches. he spoke about new 
horizons and the press as the voice of the masses. gail wynand appeared at a meeting once, 
entering unexpectedly in the middle of a session. toohey smiled and invited him to join the 
club, declaring that he was eligible. wynand did not join. he sat listening for half an hour, 
yawned, got up, and left before the meeting was over.

alvah scarret appreciated the fact that toohey did not try to reach into his field, into the 
important matters of policy. as a kind of return courtesy, scarret let toohey recommend new 
employees, when there was a vacancy to fill, particularly if the position was not an important 
one; as a rule, scarret did not care, while toohey always cared, even when it was only the 
post of copy boy. toohey's selections got the jobs. most of them were young, brash, 
competent, shifty-eyed and shook hands limply. they h

 heard of such a group, but would answer: "i expected them to say it. 
didn't you?"

hopton stoddard received so many letters of sympathy that he began to feel quite happy. he 
had never been popular before. ellsworth, he thought, was right; his brother men were 
forgiving him; ellsworth was always right.

the better newspapers dropped the story after a while. but the banner kept it going. it had 
been a boon to the banner. gail wynand was away, sailing his yacht through the indian 
ocean, and alvah scarret was stuck for a crusade. this suited him. ellsworth toohey needed 
to make no suggestions; scarret rose to the occasion all by himself.

he wrote about the decline of civilization and deplored the loss of the simple faith. he 
sponsored an essay contest for high-school students on "why i go to church." he ran a 
series of illustrated articles on "the churches of our childhood." he ran photographs of 
religious sculpture through the ages--the sphinx, gargoyles, totem poles--and gave great

hopton stoddard won the suit.

ellsworth toohey wrote in his column: "mr. roark pulled a phryne in court and didn't get away 
with it. we never believed that story in the first place."

roark was instructed to pay the costs of the temple's alterations. he said that he would not 
appeal the case. hopton stoddard announced that the temple would be remodeled into the 
hopton stoddard home for subnormal children.

on the day after the end of the trial alvah scarret gasped when he glanced at the proofs of 
"your house" delivered to his desk: the column contained most of dominique's testimony in 
court. her testimony had been quoted in the newspaper accounts of the case but only in 
harmless excerpts. alvah scarret hurried to dominique's office.

"darling, darling, darling," he said, "we can't print that."

she looked at him blankly and said nothing.

"dominique, sweetheart, be reasonable. quite apart from some of the language you use and

hed. it was an order that allowed no alternative, even if 
dominique surrendered. he hoped she would resign. he could not face the thought of having 
to fire her.

through an office boy whom he had recommended for the job, toohey obtained the decoded 
copy of wynand's cable. he put it in his pocket and went to dominique's office. he had not 
seen her since the trial. he found her engaged in emptying the drawers of her desk.

"hello," he said curtly. "what are you doing?"

"waiting to hear from alvah scarret."

"meaning?"

"waiting to hear whether i'll have to resign."

"feel like talking about the trial?"

"no."

"i do. i think i owe you the courtesy of admitting that you've done what no one has ever done 
before: you proved me wrong." he spoke coldly; his face looked flat; his eyes had no trace of 
kindness. "i had not expected you to do what you did on the stand. it was a scurvy trick. 
though up to your usual standard. i simply miscalculated the direction of your malice. 
however, you did have

you work for may have ideals, but he has to beg money and take orders from many 
contemptible people. i have no ideals--but i don't beg. take your choice. there's no other." 
the boy went back to his paper. a year later he came to wynand and asked if his offer were 
still open. wynand said that it was. the boy had remained on the banner ever since. he was 
the only one on the staff who loved gail wynand.

alvah scarret, sole survivor of the original gazette, had risen with wynand. but one could not 
say that he loved wynand--he merely clung to his boss with the automatic devotion of a rug 
under wynand's feet. alvah scarret had never hated anything, and so was incapable of love. 
he was shrewd, competent and unscrupulous in the innocent manner of one unable to grasp 
the conception of a scruple. he believed everything he wrote and everything written in the 
banner. he could hold a belief for all of two weeks.

er of great signatures were of no concern to him. the art dealers whom he patronized 
reported that his judgment was that of a master.

one night his valet saw wynand returning from the art gallery below and was shocked by the 
expression of his face; it was a look of suffering, yet the face seemed ten years younger. "are 
you ill, sir?" he asked. wynand looked at him indifferently and said: "go to bed."

"we could make a swell spread for the sunday scandal sheet out of your art gallery," said 
alvah scarret wistfully. "no," said wynand. "but why, gail?"

"look, alvah. every man on earth has a soul of his own that nobody can stare at. even the 
convicts in a penitentiary and the freaks in a side show. everybody but me. my soul is spread 
in your sunday scandal sheet--in three-color process. so i must have a substitute--even if it's 
only a locked room and a few objects not to be pawed."

it was a long process and there had been premonitory signs, but scarret did not notice a 
certain new trait in g

evoted to his convictions. he upheld 
the cause of the individual against the masses. he wrote for magazines of great prestige and 
small circulation, which were no threat to wynand. wynand bought dwight carson. he forced 

carson to write a column in the banner, dedicated to preaching the superiority of the masses 
over the man of genius. it was a bad column, dull and unconvincing; it made many people 
angry. it was a waste of space and of a big salary. wynand insisted on continuing it.

even alvah scarret was shocked by carson's apostasy. "anybody else, gail," he said, "but, 
honest, i didn't expect it of carson." wynand laughed; he laughed too long, as if he could not 
stop it; his laughter had an edge of hysteria. scarret frowned; he did not like the sight of 
wynand being unable to control an emotion; it contradicted everything he knew of wynand; it 
gave scarret a funny feeling of apprehension, like the sight of a tiny crack in a solid wall; the 
crack could not possibly endanger the wall--e

again. dwight carson became a dipsomaniac. 
two men became drug addicts. one committed suicide. this last was too much for scarret. 
"isn't it going too far, gail?" he asked. "that was practically murder."

"not at all," said wynand, "i was merely an outside circumstance. the cause was in him. if 
lightning strikes a rotten tree and it collapses, it's not the fault of the lightning."

"but what do you call a healthy tree?"

"they don't exist, alvah," said wynand cheerfully, "they don't exist."

alvah scarret never asked wynand for an explanation of this new pursuit. by some dim 
instinct scarret guessed a little of the reason behind it. scarret shrugged and laughed, telling 
people that it was nothing to worry about, it was just "a safety valve." only two men 
understood gail wynand: alvah scarret--partially; ellsworth toohey--completely.

ellsworth toohey--who wished, above all, to avoid a quarrel with wynand at that time--could 
not refrain from a feeling of resentment, because wynand had not cho

"have you ever seen pictures of the stoddard temple?"

"no. was the building worthy of the statue?"

"the statue was almost worthy of the building."

"it has been destroyed, hasn't it?"

"yes. with the help of the wynand papers."

he shrugged. "i remember alvah scarret had a good time with it. a big story. sorry i missed it. 
but alvah did very well. incidentally, how did you know that i was away and why has the fact of 
my absence remained in your memory?"

"it was the story that cost me my job with you."

"your job? with me?"

the words. they were the spring in the desert. "it doesn't matter. you're only human. that's all 
you want to be. who's any better? who has the right to cast the first stone? we're all human. 
it doesn't matter."

"my god!" said alvah scarret. "he can't! not dominique francon!"

"he will," said toohey. "as soon as she returns."

scarret had been surprised that toohey should invite him to lunch, but the news he heard 
wiped out the surprise in a greater and more painful one.

"i'm fond of dominique," said scarret, pushing his plate aside, his appetite gone. "i've always 
been very fond of her. but to have her as mrs. gail wynand!"

"these, exactly, are my own sentiments," said toohey.

"i've always advised him to marry. it helps. len

"look, ellsworth, i don't play favorites; it's all the same to me. i'll give jimmy the boot if you 
say so. only i don't see what difference it makes and what it's got to do with what we were 
talking about."

"you don't," said toohey. "you will."

"gail, you know that i want you to be happy," said alvah scarret, sitting in a comfortable 
armchair in the study of wynand's penthouse that evening. "you know that. i'm thinking of 
nothing else."

wynand lay stretched out on a couch, one leg bent, with the foot resting on the knee of the 
other. he smoked and listened silently.

"i've known dominique for years," said scarret. "long before you ever heard of her. i love her. 
i love her, you might say, like a father. but you've got to admit that she's not the kind of 
woman your public would expect to see as

 father in the throng. he looked proud and wistful; he seemed bewildered. he had 
taken the announcement of her marriage quietly; he had said: "i want you to be happy, 
dominique. i want it very much. i hope he's the right man." his tone had said that he was not 
certain.

she saw ellsworth toohey in the crowd. he noticed her looking at him and turned away 
quickly. she wanted to laugh aloud; but the matter of ellsworth toohey caught off guard did 
not seem important enough to laugh about now.

alvah scarret pushed his way toward her. he was making a poor effort at a suitable 
expression, but his face looked hurt and sullen. he muttered something rapid about his 
wishes for her happiness, but then he said distinctly and with a lively anger:

"but why, dominique? why?"

she could not quite believe that alvah scarret would permit himself the crudeness of what the 
question seemed to mean. she asked coldly:

"what are you talking about, alvah?"

"the veto, of course."

"what veto?"

"you know very wel

 dislike doesn't concern you. don't expect me to change the banner or sacrifice

she laughed. "i wouldn't ask it, gail."

he did not laugh in answer.

in his office in the banner building, he worked with a new energy, a kind of elated, ferocious 
drive that surprised the men who had known him in his most ambitious years. he stayed in the 
office all night when necessary, as he had not done for a long time. nothing changed in his 
methods and policy. alvah scarret watched him with satisfaction. "we were wrong about him, 
ellsworth," said scarret to his constant companion, "it's the same old gail, god bless him. 
better than ever."

"my dear alvah," said toohey, "nothing is ever as simple as you think--nor as fast."

"but he's happy. don't you see that he's happy?"

"to be happy is the most dangerous thing that could have happened to him. and, as a 
humanitarian for once, i mean this for his own sake."

alvah scarret read the story and liked it so much that he lost all caution. "run it off, alvah," 
sally brent urged him, "just have a proof run off and leave it on his desk. he'll okay it, see if he 
won't." that evening sally brent was fired. her costly contract was bought off--it had three 
more years to run--and she was told never to enter the banner building again for any purpose 
whatsoever.

it was too much; it seemed too ludicrous to be part of this moment's contest between them. 
he broke down by laughing frankly, in helpless disgust.

"why, gail, it's the biggest hit in town. your own critic, jules fougler"--he stopped laughing. 
he understood--"said it was the great play of our age. ellsworth toohey said it was the fresh

 made him feel his nearest approach to hatred.

gail wynand glanced at the small clock on his desk. in a few minutes he had an appointment 
with an architect. the interview, he thought, would not be difficult; he had held many such 
interviews in his life; he merely had to speak, he knew what he wanted to say, and nothing 
was required of the architect except a few sounds signifying understanding.

his glance went from the clock back to the sheets of proofs on his desk. he read an editorial 
by alvah scarret on the public feeding of squirrels in central park, and a column by ellsworth 
toohey on the great merits of an exhibition of paintings done by the workers of the city 
department of sanitation. a buzzer rang on his desk, and his secretary's voice said: "mr. 
howard roark, mr. wynand."

"okay," said wynand, flicking the switch off. as his hand moved back, he noticed the row of 
buttons at the edge of his desk, bright little knobs with a color code of their own, each 
representing the end of a w

ad spoken in the last half-hour. then he 
understood what had been strange about the interview: for the first time in his life he had 
spoken to a man without feeling the reluctance, the sense of pressure, the need of disguise 
he had always experienced when he spoke to people; there had been no strain and no need 
of strain; as if he had spoken to himself.

he pressed the button and said to his secretary:

"tell the morgue to send me everything they have on howard roark."
#

"guess what," said alvah scarret, his voice begging to be begged for his information.

ellsworth toohey waved a hand impatiently in a brushing-off motion, not raising his eyes from 
his desk.

"go 'way, alvah. i'm busy."

"no, but this is interesting, ellsworth. really, it's interesting. i know you'll want to know."

toohey lifted his head and looked at him, the faint contraction of boredom in the corners of his 
eyes letting scarret understand that this moment of attention was a favor; he drawled in a tone 
of emphasized pati

opening that envelope.

then he pulled himself erect, he put both forearms in a straight line along the edge of the 
desk, his fingers stretched and meeting, he looked down, past his nostrils, at the surface of 
the desk, he sat for a moment, grave, proud, collected, like the angular mummy of a pharaoh, 
then he moved one hand, pulled the envelope forward, opened it and began to read.

"you publish that and i'll sue hell out of you."

"you really would?"

"i would. drop it, gail. don't you see i don't want to discuss it?"

later, wynand showed the picture to dominique and asked:

"who designed this?"

she looked at it. "of course," was all she answered.

"what kind of 'changing world,' alvah? changing to what? from what? who's doing the 
changing?"

parts of alvah scarret's face looked anxious, but most of it was impatient, as he glanced at 
the proofs of his editorial on "motherhood in a changing world," which lay on wynand's desk.

"what the hell, gail," he muttered indifferently.

"that's what i want to know--what the hell?" he picked up the proof and read aloud: "'the 
world we have known is gone and done for and it's no use kidding ourselves about it. we 
cannot go back, we must go forward. the mothers of today must set the example by 
broadening their own

higher plane, to include everybody's little children. mothers must love every kid in their block, 
in their street, in their city, county, state, nation and the whole wide, wide world--just exactly as 
much as their own little mary or johnny.'" wynand wrinkled his nose fastidiously. "alvah?...it's 
all right to dish out crap. but--this kind of crap?"

alvah scarret would not look at him.

"you're out of step with the times, gail," he said. his voice was low; it had a tone of warning--
as of something baring its teeth, tentatively, just for future reference.

this was so odd a behavior for alvah scarret that wynand lost all desire to pursue the 
conversation. he drew a line across the editorial, but the blue pencil stroke seemed tired and 
ended in a blur. he said: "go and bat out something else, alvah."

scarret rose, picked up the strip of paper, turned

ad played on all other fads. but he 
could not follow. he felt no moral scruples. it was not a positive stand rationally taken; not 
defiance in the name of a cause of importance; just a fastidious feeling, something pertaining 
almost to chastity: the hesitation one feels before putting one's foot down into muck. he 
thought: it doesn't matter--it will not last--i'll be back when the wave swings on to another 
theme--i think i'd rather sit this one out.

he could not say why the encounter with alvah scarret gave him a feeling of uneasiness, 
sharper than usual. he thought it was funny that alvah should have switched to that line of 
tripe. but there had been something else; there had been a personal quality in alvah's exit; 
almost a declaration that he saw no necessity to consider the boss's opinion any longer.

i ought to fire alvah, he thought--and then laughed at himself, aghast: fire alvah scarret?--one 
might as well think of stopping the earth--or--of the unthinkable--of closing the banner.

"what's the matter with you? why do you sound like that?"

"i'm sorry. forgive me. it's just something i thought. i've been thinking of this for a long time. 
and particularly all these days when you've made me lie on deck and loaf."

"thinking about me?"

"about you--among many other things."

"what have you decided?"

"i'm not an altruist, gail. i don't decide for others."

"you don't have to worry about me. i've sold myself, but i've held no illusions about it. i've

public. that's my only vindication. i've sold my life, but i got a good price. power. i've never 
used it. i couldn't afford a personal desire. but now i'm free. now i can use it for what i want. 
for what i believe. for dominique. for you."

roark turned away. when he looked back at wynand, he said only:

"i hope so, gail."

"what have you been thinking about these past weeks?"

"the principle behind the dean who fired me from st

common anger that cured boredom and took them out of themselves, and they knew well 
enough what a blessing it was to be taken out of themselves. the readers were unanimous. 
the press was unanimous.

gail wynand went against the current.

"gail!" alvah scarret had gasped. "we can't defend a dynamiter!"

"keep still, alvah," wynand had said, "before i bash your teeth in."

gail wynand stood alone in the middle of his office, his head thrown back, glad to be living, as 
he had stood on a wharf on a dark night facing the lights of a city.

"in the filthy howling now going on all around us," said an editorial in the banner, signed "gail 
wynand" in big letters, "nobody seems to remember that howard roark surrendered himself 
of his own free will. if he b

enty-two newspapers, his magazines, his newsreels were given the order: defend 
roark. sell roark to the public. stem the lynching.

"whatever the facts," wynand explained to his staff, "this is not going to be a trial by facts. it's 
a trial by public opinion. we've always made public opinion. let's make it. sell roark. i don't 
care how you do it. i've trained you. you're experts at selling. now show me how good you 
are."

he was greeted by silence, and his employees glanced at one another. alvah scarret mopped 
his forehead. but they obeyed.

the banner printed a picture of the enright house, with the caption: "is this the man you want 
to destroy?" a picture of wynand's home: "match this, if you can." a picture of monadnock 
valley: "is this the man who has contributed nothing to society?"

the banner ran roark's biography, under the byline of a writer nobody had ever heard of; it 
was written by gail wynand. the banner ran a series on famous trials in which innocent men 
had been convicted b

y the majority prejudice of the moment. the banner ran articles on man 
martyred by society: socrates, galileo, pasteur, the thinkers, the scientists, a long, heroic 
line--each a man who stood alone, the man who defied men.

"but, gail, for god's sake, gail, it was a housing project!" wailed alvah scarret.

wynand looked at him helplessly: "i suppose it's impossible to make you fools understand that 
that has nothing to do with it. all right. we'll talk about housing projects."

the banner ran an expose on the housing racket: the graft, the incompetence, the structures 
erected at five times the cost a private builder would have needed, the settlements built and 
abandoned, the horrible performance accepted, admired, forgiven, protected by the sacred 
cow of altruism. "hell is said to be paved w

ater screens. the banner vanished from corner newsstands; the news vendors had to 
carry it, but they hid it under their counters and produced it grudgingly, only upon request. the 
ground had been prepared, the pillars eaten through long ago; the cortlandt case provided the 

final impact.

roark was almost forgotten in the storm of indignation against gail wynand. the angriest 
protests came from wynand's own public: from the women's clubs, the ministers, the 
mothers, the small shopkeepers. alvah scarret had to be kept away from the room where 
hampers of letters to the editor were being filled each day; he started by reading the letters--
and his friends on the staff undertook to prevent a repetition of the experience, fearing a 
stroke.

the staff of the banner worked in silence. there were no furtive glances, no whispered cuss 
words, no gossip in washrooms any longer. a few men resigned. the rest worked on, slowly, 
heavily, in the manner of men with life belts buckled, waiting for the inev

d with a string. they hit his cheek and rolled down to the sidewalk.

wynand stood still. he looked at the woman. he saw the white flesh, the mouth hanging open 
in triumphs, the face of self-righteous evil. passersby had seized the woman and she was 
screaming unspeakable obscenities. wynand raised his hand, shook his head, gesturing for 
them to let the creature go, and walked into the banner building, a smear of greenish-yellow 
across his cheek.

"ellsworth, what are we going to do?" moaned alvah scarret. "what are we going to do?"

ellsworth toohey sat perched on the edge of his desk, and smiled as if he wished he could 
kiss alvah scarret.

"why don't they drop the damn thing, ellsworth? why doesn't something break to take it off 
the front pages? couldn't we scare up an international situation or something? in all my born 
days i've never seen people go so wild over so little. a dynamiting job! christ, ellsworth, it's a 
back-page story. we get them every month, practically with every strike

paper.

he felt a first dim shock; because the waiting around him contained wonder in anyone's mind 
about the outcome of an issue between him and ellsworth toohey.

but he had no time to take notice of his own reactions. he had no attention to spare for 
anything except a sense of tightness, a pressure against the bones of his face, his teeth, his 
cheeks, the bridge of his nose--and he knew he must press back against that, keep it down, 
hold it.

he greeted no one and walked into his office. alvah scarret sat slumped in a chair before his 
desk. scarret had a bandage of soiled white gauze on his throat, and his cheeks were flushed. 
wynand stopped in the middle of the room. the people outside had felt relieved: wynand's 
face looked calm. alvah scarret knew better.

"gail, i wasn't here," he gulped in a cracked whisper that was not a voice at all. "i haven't been 
here for two days. laryngitis, gail. ask my doctor. i wasn't here. i just got out of bed, look at

ynand filled in as city 
editor, managing editor, wire man, rewrite man, copy boy. he did not leave the building. he 
slept on a couch in his office--as he had done in the first years of the banner's existence. 
goalless, tieless, his shirt collar torn open, he ran up and down the stairs, his steps like the 
rattle of a machine gun. two elevator boys had remained; the others had vanished, no one 
knew just when or why, whether prompted by sympathy for the strike, fear or plain 
discouragement.

alvah scarret could not understand wynand's calm. the brilliant machine--and that, thought 
scarret, was really the word which had always stood for wynand in his mind--had never 
functioned better. his words were brief, his orders rapid, his decisions immediate. in the 
confusion of machines, lead, grease, ink, waste paper, unswept offices, untenanted desks, 
glass crashing in sudden showers when a brick was hurled from the street below, wynand 
moved like a figure in double-exposure, superimposed on his bac

scale. he doesn't belong here, thought scarret, because he doesn't look modern--that's what 
it is--he doesn't look modern, no matter what kind of pants he's wearing--he looks like 
something out of a gothic cathedral. the patrician head, held level, the fleshless face that had 
shrunk tighter together. the captain of a ship known by all, save the captain, to be sinking.

alvah scarret had remained. he had not grasped that the events were real; he shuffled about 
in a stupor; he felt a fresh jolt of bewilderment each morning when he drove up to the building 
and saw the pickets. he suffered no injury beyond a few tomatoes hurled at his windshield. he 
tried to help wynand; he tried to do his work and that of five other men, but he could not 
complete a normal day's task. he was going quietly to pieces, his joints wrenched loose by a 
question mark. he wasted everybody's time,

 some say around here. one man running all

looked somewhere in the direction of a banker across the table. "has anybody here ever 
bothered to inquire about my ideas? i've got ideas. we've all got to pool ideas. what i mean is 
teamwork, one big orchestra. it's about time this paper had a modem, liberal, progressive

"shut up, mitch," said alvah scarret. scarret had drops of sweat running down his temples; he 
didn't know why; he wanted the board to win; there was just something in the room...it's too 
hot in here, he thought, i wish somebody'd open a window.

"i won't shut up!" shrieked mitchell layton. "i'm just as good as..."

"please, mr. layton," said the banker.

"all right," said layton, "all right. don't forget who holds the biggest hunk of stock next to

"gail," said alvah scarret, looking up at wynand, his eyes strangely honest and tortured, 
"gail, it's no use. but we can save the pieces. look, if we just admit that we were wrong about 
cortlandt and...and if we just take harding back, he's a valuable man, and...maybe toohey..."

"no one is to mention the name of toohey in this discussion," said wynand.

mitchell layton snapped his mouth open and dropped it shut again.

17.

it was a summer day, cloudless and cool, as if the sun were screened by an invisible film of 
water, and the energy of heat had been transformed into a sharper clarity, an added brilliance 
of outline for the buildings of the city. in the streets, scattered like scraps of gray foam, there 
were a great many copies of the banner. the city read, chuckling, the statem

the letter came back to roark, unopened.

alvah scarret ran the banner. wynand sat in his office. he had removed roark's picture from 
the wall. he attended to advertising contracts, expenses, accounts. scarret took care of the 
editorial policy. wynand did not read the contents of the banner.

when wynand appeared in any department of the building, the employees obeyed him as 
they had obeyed him before. he was still a machine and they knew that it was a machine 
more dangerous than ever: a car running downhill, without combustion or brakes.

he said:

"i'll never remind you afterward that you're crying, dominique."

the story, including the pyjamas, the dressing gown, the breakfast table and the single bed, 
was in all the afternoon papers of new york that day.

alvah scarret walked into wynand's office and threw a newspaper down on his desk. scarret 
had never discovered how much he loved wynand, until now, and he was so hurt that he 
could express it only in furious abuse. he gulped:

"god damn you, you blasted fool! it serves you right! it serves you right and i'm glad, damn 
your witless soul! now what are we going to do?"

wynand read the story and sat looking at the paper. scarret stood before the desk. nothing 
happened. it was just an office, a man sat at a

inique."
#

all the newspapers of new york were brought to wynand's office each day, as he had 
ordered. he read every word of what was written and whispered in town. everybody knew that 
the story had been a self-frame-up; the wife of a multimillionaire would not report the loss of a 
five-thousand-dollar ring in the circumstances; but this did not prevent anyone from accepting 
the story as given and commenting accordingly. the most offensive comments were spread 
on the pages of the banner.

alvah scarret had found a crusade to which he devoted himself with the truest fervor he had 

ever experienced. he felt that it was his atonement for any disloyalty he might have committed 
toward wynand in the past. he saw a way to redeem wynand's name. he set out to sell 
wynand to the public as the victim of a great passion for a depraved woman; it was 
dominique who had forced her husband to champion an immoral cause, against his better 
judgment; she had almost wrecked her husband's paper, his standing
