Sister - 
                The narrator and town's postmistress. Sister is exactly one year older than Stella-Rondo and was involved with Mr. Whitaker before Stella-Rondo became engaged to him. Sister is frank and outspoken, but her pettiness and jealousy often get the best of her, clouding her view of the world. Sister's telling of the story is full of comedy, and her humor helps her cope with stress and the hurt that her family members sometimes inflict.
