the life and opinions of tristram shandy, gentleman


to the right honourable mr. pitt.

sir,

never poor wight of a dedicator had less hopes from his dedication,
than i have from this of mine; for it is written in a bye corner of the
kingdom, and in a retir'd thatch'd house, where i live in a constant
endeavour to fence against the infirmities of ill health, and other
evils of life, by mirth; being firmly persuaded that every time a man
smiles,--but much more so, when he laughs, it adds something to this
fragment of life.

i humbly b

under your protection,--it must protect itself, but)--into the country
with you; where, if i am ever told, it has made you smile; or can
conceive it has beguiled you of one moment's pain--i shall think myself
as happy as a minister of state;--perhaps much happier than any one (one
only excepted) that i have read or heard of.

i am, great sir, (and, what is more to your honour) i am, good sir, your
well-wisher, and most humble fellow-subject,

the author.

chapter 1.i.

i wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they
were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about
when they begot me; had they duly consider'd how much depended upon what
they were then doing;--that not only the production of a rational
being was concerned in it, but that possibly the happy formation and
temperature of his body, perhaps his genius and the very cast of his
mind;--and, for aught they knew to the

following,'--it brings the thing almost to a certainty. however,
what follows in the beginning of the next chapter, puts it beyond all
possibility of a doubt.

--but pray, sir, what was your father doing all december, january, and
february?--why, madam,--he was all that time afflicted with a sciatica.



chapter 1.v.

on the fifth day of november, 1718, which to the aera fixed on, was
as near nine kalendar months as any husband could in reason have
expected,--was i tristram shandy, gentleman, brought forth into this
scurvy and disastrous world of ours.--i wish i had been born in the
moon, or in any of the planets, (except jupiter or saturn, because i
never could bear cold weather) for it could not well have fared worse
with me in any of them (though i will not answer for venus) than it
has in this vile, dirty planet of ours,--which, o' my conscience, with
reverence be it spoken, i take to be made up of the shreds and clippings
of the rest;--not but the planet is well eno

 it as such, and that you will permit
me to lay it, with the most respectful humility, at your lordship's
feet--when you are upon them,--which you can be when you please;--and
that is, my lord, whenever there is occasion for it, and i will add, to
the best purposes too. i have the honour to be,

                        my lord,
                        your lordship's most obedient,
                        and most devoted,
                        and most humble servant,
                        tristram shandy.'



chapter 1.ix.

i solemnly declare to all mankind, that the above dedication was made
for no one prince, prelate, pope, or potentate,--duke, marquis, earl,
viscount, or baron, of this, or any other realm in christendom;--nor has
it yet been hawked about, or offered publicly or privately, directly
or indirectly, to any one person or personage, great or small; but is
honestly a true virgin-dedication untried on, upon any soul living.

i labour this point so particularly, merely to remove any

the preceding chapter: all which, from the words, de gustibus non est
disputandum, and whatever else in this book relates to hobby-horses, but
no more, shall stand dedicated to your lordship.--the rest i dedicate to
the moon, who, by the bye, of all the patrons or matrons i can think of,
has most power to set my book a-going, and make the world run mad after
it.

bright goddess, if thou art not too busy with candid and miss cunegund's
affairs,--take tristram shandy's under thy protection also.



chapter 1.x.

whatever degree of small merit the act of benignity in favour of the
midwife might justly claim, or in whom that claim truly rested,--at
first sight seems not very material to this history;--certain however it
was, that the gentlewoman, the parson's wife, did run away at that time
with the whole of it: and yet, for my life, i cannot help thinking but
that the parson himself, though he had not the good fortune to hit upon
the design first,--yet, as h

mr. tristram shandy's compliments to messrs. le moyne, de romigny, and
de marcilly; hopes they all rested well the night after so tiresome a
consultation.--he begs to know, whether after the ceremony of marriage,
and before that of consummation, the baptizing all the homunculi at
once, slapdash, by injection, would not be a shorter and safer cut
still; on condition, as above, that if the homunculi do well, and come
safe into the world after this, that each and every of them shall be

--this requires explanation.

my father, who dipped into all kinds of books, upon looking into
lithopaedus senonesis de portu difficili, (the author is here twice
mistaken; for lithopaedus should be wrote thus, lithopaedii senonensis
icon. the second mistake is, that this lithopaedus is not an author,
but a drawing of a petrified child. the account of this, published by
athosius 1580, may be seen at the end of cordaeus's works in spachius.
mr. tristram shandy has been led into this error, either from seeing
lithopaedus's name of late in a catalogue of learned writers in dr...,
or by mistaking lithopaedus for trinecavellius,--from the too great
similitude of the names.) published by adrianus smelvgot, had found out,
that the lax and pliable state of a child's head in parturition, the
bones of the cranium having no sutures at that time, was such,--that by
force of the woman's efforts, which, in strong labour-pains, was

both fairly started together--there is no man living which had seen the
bag with all that obadiah had done to it,--and known likewise the great
speed the goddess can make when she thinks proper, who would have had
the least doubt remaining in his mind--which of the two would have
carried off the prize. my mother, madam, had been delivered sooner than
the green bag infallibly--at least by twenty knots.--sport of small

they have been; nor had the fortunes of thy house and the occasions of
making them, which have so often presented themselves in the course
of thy life, to thee, been so often, so vexatiously, so tamely, so
irrecoverably abandoned--as thou hast been forced to leave them;--but
