  would  go  to  church, 
but no, they held a special service in the pink house, and 
people  came  to  them.  it  was  a  group  called  the  
daughters of mary, which august had organized.

the daughters of mary started showing up in the 
parlor before 10:00 a.m. first was an old woman named 
queenie  and  her  grown  daughter,  violet.  they  were 
dressed  alike in  bright yellow  skirts  and white  blouses, 
though  they  wore  different  hats,  at  least.  next  came 
lunelle,  mabelee,  and  cressie,  who  wore  the  fanciest 
hats i'd ever laid eyes on. 

it turned out lunelle was a hatmaker without the 
least bit of shyness. i'm talking about purple felt the size 
of  a  sombrero  with  fake  fruit  on  the  back.  that  was 
lunelle's. 

mabelee  wore  a  creation  of  tiger  fur  wrapped 
with gold fringe, but it was cressie who carried the day 
in a  crimson smokestack with black netting and ostrich 
feathers. 

if this was not enough, they wore clip-on earbobs

and played "amazing grace," and the daughters of mary 
got  to  their  feet  and  swayed  together  like  colorful 
seaweed  on  the  ocean  floor.  i  thought  this  was  the 
grand  finale,  but  no,  june  switched  over  to  the  piano 
and banged out a jazzed-up version of "go tell it on the 
mountain." that's when august started a conga-line. she 
danced  over  to  lunelle,  who  latched  on  to  august's 
waist.  cressie  hooked  on  to  lunelle,  followed  by 
mabelee, and  off  they  went around the  room,  causing 
cressie to grab hold of her crimson hat. 

when  they  swung  back  by,  queenie  and  violet 
joined them, then sugar-girl.  i wanted  to be  part of it, 
too,  but  i only watched,  and  so  did rosaleen and otis. 
june seemed to play faster and faster. i fanned my face, 
trying to get a little air, feeling light-headed. when the 
dance  ended,  the  daughters  stood  panting  in  a  half 
circle before our lady of chains, and what they did ne

ast  time  i'd  seen 
them,  queenie  and  her  daughter,  violet,  had  on  the 
smallest hats in the group, and this time they'd left them 
off completely. i think it was because queenie hated to 
cover the whiteness of her hair, which she was proud to 
have, and violet, who had to be forty at least, couldn't 
bring herself to wear a hat if her mother wasn't wearing 
one.  if  queenie  went  into  the  kitchen  and  stuck  her 
head in the oven, violet would go stick hers in, too. 

lunelle,  mabelee,  cressie,  and  sugar-girl  each 
wore  a  black  hat,  not  as  spectacular  as  the  previous 
ones, except for lunelle's, which had both a red veil and 
a red feather. they took off the hats and lined them up 
on  the  piano  as  soon  as  they  came  in,  so  that  you  
wanted to say, what's the use? 

they got under way slicing ham, laying out fried 
chicken,  shaking  paprika  on  the  deviled  eggs.  we  had

when we were so full that what we needed was 
a  nap,  we  went  to  the  parlor  and  sat  with  may.  the  
daughters  passed  around  a  wooden  bowl  full  of 
something  they  called  manna.  a  salted  mixture  of 
sunflower,  sesame,  pumpkin,  and  pomegranate  seeds 
drizzled with honey and baked to perfection. they ate it 
by  the  handfuls,  saying  they  wouldn't  dream  of  sitting 
with  the  dead  without  eating  seeds.  seeds  kept  the 
living from despair, they explained. 

mabelee  said,  "she  looks  so  goodâ€”doesn't  she 

look good?" 

queenie snorted. "if she looks that good, maybe 
we ought to put her on display in the drive-by window at 
the funeral home." 

"oh, queenie!" cried mabelee. 
cressie noticed rosaleen and me sitting there in 
the  dark  and  said,  "the  funeral  home  in  town  has  a 
drive-by window. it used to be a bank." 

"nowadays they put the open casket right up in 
the window where we used to drive through and get our 
checks cashed," said q

day  and  night  was 
arranging  herself  around  us.  cooling  things  down, 
staining  and  dyeing the  evening  purple  and blue  black. 
rosaleen brought out the platter of honey cakes and set 
them on one of the tables. 

august motioned us to stand around the table in 

a circle. the mary day program was under way.

"these  are  mary's  honey  cakes.  cakes  for  the 

queen of heaven," august said. 

she took one of them in her hand and, pinching 
off a  piece, held it before  mabelee, who stood next to 
her  in  the  circle.  august  said,  "this  is  the  body  of  the  
blessed mother." mabelee closed her eyes and opened 
her mouth, and august laid the cake on her tongue. 

after mabelee had swallowed, she did the same 
thing august had doneâ€”snipped off a piece and gave it 
to  the  next  person  in  the  circle,  who  happened  to  be 
neil.  mabdee,  who  could  not  have  measured  five  feet 
tall in spike heels, practically needed a stepladder to get 
up to his mou

th. neil crouched down and opened wide. 
"this is the body of the mother," mabelee said, 
and popped it in. i did not know one thing, really, about 
the catholic  church,  but somehow  i felt  sure the  pope 
would  have  keeled  over  if  he'd  seen  this.  not  brother 
gerald, though. he wouldn't have wasted time fainting, 
just gotten busy arranging the exorcism. 

me, i had never seen grown-ups feed each other, 
and i watched with the feeling i might burst out crying. i 
don't  know  what  got  to  me  about  it,  but  for  some 
reason that circle of feeding made me fee

t, we 
spent all that time cleaning honey off her, and here they 
go putting it back on. 

i  decided  nothing  these  women  did  would  ever 
surprise  me  again,  but  that  lasted  about  one  second, 
because next the daughters swarmed around our  lady 
like a circle of bee attendants and rubbed the honey into 
the wood, working it into the top of her head, into her 
cheeks,  her  neck  and  shoulders  and  arms,  across  her 
breasts, her belly. 

"come  on,  lily,  and  help  us,"  said  mabelee. 
rosaleen had already dived in and was coating honey all 
over our lady's thighs. 

i  hung  back,  but  cressie  took  my  hands  and 
dragged  me  over  to  mary,  slapped  them  down  in  the 
muck of sun-warmed honey, right on top of our lady's 
red heart. 

i  remembered  how  i'd  visited  our  lady  in  the 
middle  of  the  night,  how  i'd  placed  my  hand  on  that 
same spot. you are my mother, i'd told her then. you are 
the mother of thousands. 

"i don't get why we're doing this

but it's so strong-acting people used to smear it on dead 
bodies  to  embalm  them.  mothers  buried  their  dead 
babies in it, and it would keep them fresh." 

this  was  a  use  for  honey  i  hadn't  considered.  i  
could just see funeral homes selling big jars of honey for 
dead people, instead of coffins. i tried to picture that in 
the drive-through window at the funeral home. 

i began to work my hands into the wood, almost 

embarrassed at the intimacy of what we were doing. 

once mabelee leaned her head over too far and 
got honey all in her hair, but it was lunelle who took the

cake with honey dripping off the ends of her elbows. she 
kept  trying  to  lick  it  off,  but  of  course  her  tongue  
couldn't reach that far. 

the ants started a single-file parade up the side 
of  our  lady,  drawn  by  the  honey,  and  not  to  be 
outdone, a handful of scout bees showed up and landed 
on our lady's head. let somebody bring out the honey 
and the insect kingdom wil

10. 

neil's  brother,  an  african  methodist/episcopal 
reverend  from  albany,  georgia,  was  going  to  marry 
them in the  backyard under the myrtle  trees.  june laid

walking  down  an  aisle  of  rose  petals,  wearing  a  white 
rayon  suit  with  frog  closings  that  mabelee  was  sewing 
for  her.  i  could  not  picture  frog  closings.  june  drew  a 
picture of one on a tablet, and afterward i still could not 
picture them. lunelle had been commissioned to make 
her a wedding hat, which i thought was very courageous 
of  june.  there  was  no  telling  what  she  would  end  up 
with on her head. 

rosaleen  offered  to  bake  the  wedding  cake 
layers, and violet and queenie were going to decorate it 
with a "rainbow theme."

"i don't care where the hell you are or where you 

end up," he said to her. "but lily's coming with me." 

even as he said it, i could tell he didn't want me, 
didn't  want  me  back  on  the  farm,  didn't  want  to  be 
reminded of her. another part of himâ€”the good part, if 
there was such a thingâ€”might even be thinking that i'd 
be better off here. 

it  was  pride  now,  all  pride.  how  could  he  back  

down? 

the  front  door  opened,  and  queenie,  violet, 
lunelle,  and  mabelee  stumbled  into  the  house,  all 
wound  up  and  looking  like  they  had  their  clothes  on 
backward. queenie stared at my cheek. 

"everybody all right?" she said, out of breath. 
"we're all right," said august. "this is mr. owens, 

lily's father. he came for a visit." 

"i didn't get an answer at sugar-girl's or cressie's 

house,"

us,  clutching their  pocketbooks  up against their  bodies

i wondered how we must look to him. a bunch of 
womenâ€”mabelee four foot ten, lunelle's hair standing 
straight  up  on  her  head  begging  to  be  braided,  violet 
muttering,  "blessed  mary,"  and  queenieâ€”tough  old 
queenieâ€”with her hands on her hips and her lip shoved 
out, every inch of her saying, i double-dog dare you to 
take this girl. 

t. ray sniffed hard and looked at the ceiling. his 
resolve  was  crumbling  all  around  him.  you  could 
practically see bits of it flaking off. 

august  saw 

it,  too.  she  stepped  forward.

in the autumn south carolina changed her color 
to  ruby  red  and  wild  shades  of  orange.  i  watch  them 
now from my upstairs room, the room june left behind 
when  she  got  married  last  month.  i  could  not  have 
dreamed such a room. august bought me a new bed and 
a dressing table, white french provincial from the sears 
and  roebuck  catalog.  violet  and  queenie  donated  a 
flowered rug that had been laying around in their extra 
room  going  to  waste,  and  mabelee  sewed  blue-and-
white  polka  dot  curtains  for  the  windows  with  fringe 
balls along the hem. cressie crocheted four eight-legged 
octopuses out of various colors of yarn to sit on the bed. 
one  octopus  would  have  been  enough  for  me,  but  it's 
the only handicraft cressie knows how to do, so she just 
keeps doing it. 

lunelle created me a hat that outdid every other 
hat  she'd  ever  made,  including  june's  wedding  hat.  it 
reminds me a little of the pope's hat. it is tall,
