rough the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed
at the same moment. and then--something--moved beneath them, there was a
gasp and a cry--and somebody said in muffled accents:

“merciful goodness!”

anne and diana were never able to tell just how they got off that bed
and out of the room. they only knew that after one frantic rush they
found themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs.

“oh, who was it--_what_ was it?” whispered anne, her teeth chattering with
cold and fright.

“it was aunt josephine,” said diana, gasping with laughter. “oh, anne,
it was aunt josephine, however she came to be there. oh, and i know she
will be furious. it’s dreadful--it’s really dreadful--but did you ever
know anything so funny, anne?”

“who is your aunt josephine?”

“she’s father’s aunt and she lives in charlottetown. she’s awfully
old--seventy anyhow--and i don’t believe she was _ever_ a little girl. we
were expecting her out for a visit, but not so soon. she’s awfully prim

oper and she’ll scold dreadfully about this, i know. well, we’ll
have to sleep with minnie may--and you can’t think how she kicks.”

miss josephine barry did not appear at the early breakfast the next
morning. mrs. barry smiled kindly at the two little girls.

“did you have a good time last night? i tried to stay awake until you
came home, for i wanted to tell you aunt josephine had come and that you
would have to go upstairs after all, but i was so tired i fell asleep. i
hope you didn’t disturb your aunt, diana.”

diana preserved a discreet silence, but she and anne exchanged furtive
smiles of guilty amusement across the table. anne hurried home after
breakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which
presently resulted in the barry household until the late afternoon, when
she went down to mrs. lynde’s on an errand for marilla.

“so you a

. lynde had not. she shook her head sagely.

“you must learn to think a little, anne, that’s what. the proverb you
need to go by is ‘look before you leap’--especially into spare-room
beds.”

mrs. lynde laughed comfortably over her mild joke, but anne remained
pensive. she saw nothing to laugh at in the situation, which to her
eyes appeared very serious. when she left mrs. lynde’s she took her way
across the crusted fields to orchard slope. diana met her at the kitchen
door.

“your aunt josephine was very cross about it, wasn’t she?” whispered
anne.

“yes,” answered diana, stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance
over her shoulder at the closed sitting-room door. “she was fairly
dancing with rage, anne. oh, how she scolded. she said i was the
worst-behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed
of the way they had brought me up. she says she won’t stay and i’m sure
i don’t care. but father and mother do.”

“why didn’t you tell them it was my

after this.”

when the commonplace breakfast was over diana appeared, crossing the
white log bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her crimson
ulster. anne flew down the slope to meet her.

“merry christmas, diana! and oh, it’s a wonderful christmas. i’ve
something splendid to show you. matthew has given me the loveliest
dress, with _such_ sleeves. i couldn’t even imagine any nicer.”

“i’ve got something more for you,” said diana breathlessly. “here--this
box. aunt josephine sent us out a big box with ever so many things in
it--and this is for you. i’d have brought it over last night, but it
didn’t come until after dark, and i never feel very comfortable coming
through the haunted wood in the dark now.”

anne opened the box and peeped in. first a card with “for the anne-girl
and merry christmas,” written on it; and then, a pair of the daintiest
little kid slippers, with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening
buckles.

“oh,” said anne, “diana, thi

a moral into them all, marilla,” explained
anne. “i insist upon that. all the good people are rewarded and all
the bad ones are suitably punished. i’m sure that must have a wholesome
effect. the moral is the great thing. mr. allan says so. i read one of
my stories to him and mrs. allan and they both agreed that the moral was
excellent. only they laughed in the wrong places. i like it better when
people cry. jane and ruby almost always cry when i come to the pathetic
parts. diana wrote her aunt josephine about our club and her aunt
josephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories. so
we copied out four of our very best and sent them. miss josephine barry
wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life. that
kind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost
everybody died. but i’m glad miss barry liked them. it shows our club
is doing some good in the world. mrs. allan says that ought to be our
object in everything. i do really try to

“jane’s mother is going to let her have a birthday party?”

diana shook her head, her black eyes dancing with merriment.

“i can’t think what it can be,” said anne in despair, “unless it’s that
moody spurgeon macpherson saw you home from prayer meeting last night.
did he?”

“i should think not,” exclaimed diana indignantly. “i wouldn’t be likely
to boast of it if he did, the horrid creature! i knew you couldn’t guess
it. mother had a letter from aunt josephine today, and aunt josephine
wants you and me to go to town next tuesday and stop with her for the
exhibition. there!”

“oh, diana,” whispered anne, finding it necessary to lean up against a
maple tree for support, “do you really mean it? but i’m afraid marilla
won’t let me go. she will say that she can’t encourage gadding about.
that was what she said last week when jane invited me to go with them
in their double-seated buggy to the american concert at the white sands
hotel. i wante

nings.”

“no; miss stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all. she says
it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not
think about the exams at all and go to bed early. it’s good advice, but
i expect it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, i think.
prissy andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her
entrance week and crammed for dear life; and i had determined to sit up
_at least_ as long as she did. it was so kind of your aunt josephine to
ask me to stay at beechwood while i’m in town.”

“you’ll write to me while you’re in, won’t you?”

“i’ll write tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes,” promised
anne.

“i’ll be haunting the post office wednesday,” vowed diana.

anne went to town the following monday and on wednesday diana haunted
the post office, as agreed, and got her letter.


“dearest diana” [wrote anne],

“here it is tuesday night and i’m writing this in the library at
