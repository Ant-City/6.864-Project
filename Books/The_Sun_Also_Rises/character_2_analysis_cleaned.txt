[CHARACTER] 

cohn has spent his entire life feeling like an outsider
because he is jewish. while at princeton, he took up boxing to combat
his feelings of shyness and inferiority. although his confidence
has grown with his literary success, his anxiety about being different
or considered not good enough persists. these feelings of otherness
and inadequacy may explain his irrational attachment to brett--he
is so terrified of rejection that, when it happens, he refuses to
accept it.
	the individuals with whom cohn travels to spain only
compound his insecurities. not only is he the only jew among them,
but he is also the only nonveteran. jake and his friends seize on
these differences and take out their own personal insecurities on
cohn. it is important to note that cohn's behavior toward brett
is ultimately not very different from that of most of the men in
the novel. they all want to possess her in ways that she resists.
but cohn's attempts to win brett are so clumsy and foolish that
they provide an easy target for mockery.
	cohn adheres to an outdated, prewar value system of honor
and romance. he fights only within the confines of the gym until
his rage and frustration make him lash out at romero and jake. he
plays hard at tennis, but if he loses he accepts defeat gracefully.
furthermore, he cannot believe that his affair with brett has no
emotional value. hence, he acts as a foil for jake and the other
veterans in the novel; unlike them, he holds onto traditional values
and beliefs, likely because he never experienced world war i firsthand.
	sadly, cohn's value system has no place in the postwar
world, and cohn cannot sustain it. his tearful request that romero
shake his hand after cohn has beaten him up is an absurd attempt
to restore the validity of an antiquated code of conduct. his flight
from pamplona is symbolic of the failure of traditional values in
the postwar world.
