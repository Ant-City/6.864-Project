 blue, his complexion that of a turkey. his lean figure is still erect and square-shouldered. he is stripped to the waist, his coat, shirt, undershirt, collar and tie crushed up into a pillow on the table in front of him, his head sideways on this pillow, facing front, his arms dangling toward the floor. on his lower left shoulder is the big ragged scar of an old wound.

at the table at right, front, harry hope, the proprietor, sits in the middle, facing front, with pat mcgloin on his right and ed mosher on his left, the other two chairs being unoccupied.

both mcgloin and mosher are big paunchy men. mcgloin has his old occupation of policeman stamped all over him. he is in his fifties, sandy-haired, bullet-headed, jowly, with protruding ears and little round eyes. his face must once have been brutal and greedy, but time and whiskey have melted it down into a good-humored, parasite's characterlessness. he wears old clothes and is slovenly. he is slumped sideways on his chair, his head drooping

jerkily toward one shoulder.

ed mosher is going on sixty. he has a round kewpie's face--a kewpie who is an unshaven habitual drunkard. he looks like an enlarged, elderly, bald edition of the village fat boy--a sly fat boy, congenitally indolent, a practical joker, a born grafter and con merchant. but amusing and essentially harmless, even in his most enterprising days, because always too lazy to carry crookedness beyond petty swindling. the influence of his old circus career is apparent in his get-up. his worn clothes are flashy; he

he outside world at all. this place has a fine trade from the market people across the street and the waterfront workers, so in spite of harry's thirst and his generous heart, he comes out even. he never worries in hard times because there's always old friends from the days when he was a jitney tammany politician, and a friendly brewery to tide him over. don't ask me what his two pals work at because they don't. except at being his lifetime guests. the one facing this way is his brother-in-law, ed mosher, who once worked for a circus in the ticket wagon. pat mcgloin, the other one, was a police lieutenant back in the flush times of graft when everything went. but he got too greedy and when the usual reform investigation came he was caught red-handed and thrown off the force. (he nods at joe.) joe here has a yesterday in the same flush period. he ran a colored gambling house then and was a hell of a sport, so they say. well, that's our whole family circle of inmates, except the two barkeeps and

me, and i'd get blind to the world now if it was the iceman of death himself treating! (he stops, startledly, a superstitious awe coming into his face.) what made me say that, i wonder. (with a sardonic laugh) well, be god, it fits, for death was the iceman hickey called to his home!

rocky--aw, forget dat iceman gag! de poor dame is dead. (pushing a bottle and glass at larry) gwan and get paralyzed! i'll be glad to see one bum in dis dump act natural. (larry downs a drink and pours another.)

(ed mosher appears in the doorway from the hall. the same change which is apparent in the manner and appearance of the others shows in him. he is sick, his nerves are shattered, his eyes are apprehensive, but he, too, puts on an exaggeratedly self-confident bearing. he saunters to the bar between larry and the street entrance.)

mosher--morning, rocky. hello, larry. glad to see brother hickey hasn't corrupted you to temperance. i wouldn't mind a shot myself. (as rocky shoves a bottle toward him he shakes

about a job, i felt the same as you, cecil. (at the table by the window hugo speaks to larry again.)

hugo--(with uneasy insistence) what's matter, larry? you look scared. what you listen for out there? (but larry doesn't hear, and joe begins talking in the group at right.)

joe--(with drunken self-assurance) no, suh, i wasn't fool enough to git in no crap game. not while hickey's around. crazy people puts a jinx on you. (mcgloin is now heard. he is leaning across in front of wetjoen to talk to ed mosher on hope's left.)

mcgloin--(with drunken earnestness) i know you saw how it was, ed. there was no good trying to explain to a crazy guy, but it ain't the right time. you know how getting reinstated is.

mosher--(decidedly) sure, mac. the same way with the circus. the boys tell me the rubes are wasting all their money buying food and times never was so hard. and i never was one to cheat for chicken feed.

hope--(looks around him in an ecstasy of bleery sentimental content) bejees, i'm cockeyed!
