    will you be ready? do you like this haste?

    it may be thought we held him carelessly,
    being our kinsman, if we revel much.

  lady. well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
    one who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
    hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
    that thou expects not nor i look'd not for.

  jul. madam, in happy time! what day is that?

  lady. marry, my child, early next thursday morn
    the gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
    the county paris, at saint peter's church,
    shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

  jul. now by saint peter's church, and peter too,
    he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
    i wonder at this haste, that i must wed
    ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
    i pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
    i will not marry yet; and when i do, i swear
    it shall be romeo, whom you know i hate,
    rather than paris. these are news indeed!

  lady. here comes your father.

 what say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
    some comfort, nurse.

  nurse. faith, here it is.
    romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
    that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
    or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
    then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
    i think it best you married with the county.
    o, he's a lovely gentleman!
    romeo's a dishclout to him. an eagle, madam,
    hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
    as paris hath. beshrew my very heart,
    i think you are happy in this second match,
    for it excels your first; or if it did not,
    your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
    as living here and you no use of him.

  jul. speak'st thou this from thy heart?

  nurse. and from my soul too; else beshrew them both.

    what's here? a cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
    poison, i see, hath been his timeless end.
    o churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
    to help me after? i will kiss thy lips.

ief, for my short date of breath
    is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet;
    and she, there dead, that romeo's faithful wife.
    i married them; and their stol'n marriage day
    was tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
    banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
    for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pin'd.
    you, to remove that siege of grief from her,
    betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    to county paris. then comes she to me
    and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    to rid her from this second marriage,
    or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    then gave i her (so tutored by my art)
    a sleeping potion; which so took effect
    as i intended, for it wrought on her
    the form of death. meantime i writ to romeo
    that he should hither come as this dire night
    to help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    being the time the potion's force should cease.

   but he which bore my letter, friar john,
    was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    return'd my letter back. then all alone
    at the prefixed hour of her waking
    came i to take her from her kindred's vault;
    meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    till i conveniently could send to romeo.
    but when i came, some minute ere the time
    of her awaking, here untimely lay
    the noble paris and true romeo dead.
    she wakes; and i entreated her come forth
    and bear this work of heaven with patience;
    but then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
    and she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    but, as it seems, did violence on herself.
    all this i know, and to the marriage
    her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
    miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
    unto the rigour of severest law.
