Erwin Schrodinger  (1887-1961) - 
An Austrian physicist. Schrodinger argued that waves
were really "smeared" electrons. He objected to the then-universally
accepted description of matter in terms of waves and particles, and
instead advanced a quantum mechanical wave equation. Schrodinger
shared the Nobel Prize of 1933.
