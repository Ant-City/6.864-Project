book in order to collect herself.  a  man she knew  had come all the  way by train and  walked the  four  miles uphill  from the

there looking down on him. moonlight across the foliage on the walls. this was the only light that made the trompe 1’oeil 
seem convincing. she could pluck that flower and pin it onto her dress. 

 
the man named caravaggio pushes open all the windows in the room so he can hear the noises of the night. he undresses, 
rubs his palms gently over his neck and for a while lies down on the unmade bed. the noise of the trees, the breaking of moon 
into silver fish bouncing off the leaves of asters outside. the moon is on him like skin, a sheaf of water. an hour later he is on 
the roof of the villa. up on the peak he is aware of the shelled sections along the slope of roofs, the two acres of destroyed 
gardens and orcha

he reminds her. “you told me once you were in love with him.” 
hana bows her head, embarrassed. 
caravaggio walks around, looking at the building for the first time, peering down from the loggia into the garden. 
“yes, you used to love him. you used to drive us all mad with your new information about giuseppe. what a man! the best 

in every way, you’d say. we all had to agree with you, the cocky sixteen-year-old.”

painted like a garden. as if all that remains is a capsule from the past, long before verdi, the medicis considering a balustrade 
or window, holding up a candle at night in the presence of an invited architect—the best architect in the fifteenth century—and 
requesting something more satisfying to frame that vista. 

“if you are staying,” she says, “we are going to need more food. i have planted vegetables, we have a sack of beans, but we 

need some chickens.” she is looking at caravaggio, knowing his skills from the past, not quite saying it. 

“i lost my nerve,” he says. 
“i’ll come with you, then,” hana offers. “we’ll do it together. you can teach me to steal, show me what to do.” 
“you don’t understand. i lost my nerve.” 
“why?” 
“i was caught. they nearly chopped off my rucking hands.”

then there is blackness. he doesn’t know whether to move, whether she will whisper to the man fucking her about the other 
person in the room. a naked thief. a naked assassin. should he move—his hands out to break a neck—towards the couple on 
the bed? 

he hears the man’s lovemaking continue, hears the silence of the woman—no whisper—hears her thinking, her eyes aimed 
towards him in the darkness. the word should be think-ering. caravaggio’s mind slips into this consideration, another syllable 
to suggest collecting a thought as one tinkers with a half-completed bicycle. words are tricky things, a friend of his has told 
him, they’re much more tricky than violins. his mind recalls the woman’s blonde hair, the black ribbon in it. 

he hears the car turning and waits for another moment of light. the face that emerges out of the dark is still an arrow upon 
him.  the  light  moves  from  her  face  down  onto  the  body  of  t

is aware it is her agreement with him. no words, no hint of irony, just a contract with him, the morse of understanding, so he 
knows he can now move safely to the verandah and drop out into the night.

he ambles naked up the stairs to the second floor, where the guards are, bending down to laugh at some privacy, so his face

one long hall on the third floor. a guard by the stair and one at the far end twenty yards away, too many yards away. so a 
long  theatrical  walk,  and  caravaggio  now  having  to  perform  it,  watched  with  quiet  suspicion  and  scornfully  by  the  two 
bookended sentries, the ass-and-cock walk, pausing at a section of mural to peer at a painted donkey in a grove. he leans his

caravaggio watches hana, who sits across from him looking into his eyes, trying to read him, trying to figure the flow of 
thought the way his wife used to do. he watches her sniffing him out, searching for the trace. he buries it and looks back at 
her, knowing his eyes are faultless, clear as any river, unimpeachable as a landscape. people, he knows, get lost in them, and he 
is able to hide well. but the girl watches him quizzically, tilting her head in a question as a dog would when spoken to in a ton

further rooms. she worked along the edges of them aware always of unexploded mines. in one soil-rich area beside the house 
she began to garden with a furious passion that could come only to someone who had grown up in a city. in spite of the burned 
earth, in spite of the lack of water. someday there would be a bower of limes, rooms of green light. 

 
caravaggio came into the kitchen to find hana sitting hunched over the table. he could not see her face or her arms tucked

her hammock and her shoes and her frock. she was secure in the miniature world she had built; the two other men seemed 
distant planets, each in his own sphere of memory and solitude. caravaggio, who had been her father’s gregarious friend in 
canada, in those days was capable of standing still and causing havoc within the caravan of women he seemed to give himself 
over to. he now lay in his darkness. he had been a thief who refused to work with men, because he did not trust them, who 
talked  with  men but  who preferred talking  to  women and  when he began talking to  women  was  soon caught in the  nets of 
relationship.  when  she  would  sneak  home  in  the  early  hours  of

to remain sane in their company. you needed to grab their hair and clutch it like a drowner so they would pull you into their 
midst. otherwise they, walking casually down the street towards you, almost about to wave, would leap over a wall and be 
gone for months. as an uncle he had been a disappearer.

throughout the  war, with all of her worst patients, she survived by keeping a coldness hidden in her role as nurse. i will 
survive this. i won’t fall apart at this. these were buried sentences all through her war, all through the towns they crept towards

in her childhood her classroom had been caravaggio. he had taught her the somersault. now, with his hands always in his 
pockets,  he  just  gestures  with  his  shoulders.  who  knew  what  country  the  war  had  made  him  live  in.  she  herself  had  been 
trained at women’s college hospital and then sent overseas during the sicilian invasion. that was in 1943. the first canadian

she swabbed arms that kept bleeding. she removed so many pieces of shrapnel she felt she’d transported a ton of metal out 
of the huge body of the human that she was caring for while the army travelled north. one night when one of the patients died 
she ignored all rules and took the pair of tennis shoes he had with him in his pack and put them on. they were slightly too big 
for her but she was comfortable. 

her face became tougher and leaner, the face caravaggio would meet later. she was thin, mostly from tiredness. she was 
always  hungry  and  found  it  a  furious  exhaustion  to  feed  a  patient  who  couldn’t  eat  or  didn’t  want  to,  watching  the  bread 
crumble away, the soup cool, which she desired to swallow fast. she wanted nothing exotic, just bread, meat. one of the towns 
had a bread-making section attached to the hospital and in her free time she moved among the bakers, inhaling the dust and the 
promise of food. later, when they

when they came into the house the english patient was shouting. hana let go of caravaggio and he watched her run up the 

stairs, her tennis shoes flashing as she ascended and wheeled around with the banister.

the voice filled the halls. caravaggio walked into the kitchen, tore off a section of bread and followed hana up the stairs. 

as  he  walked  towards  the  room  the  shouts  became  more  frantic.  when  he  stepped  into  the  bedroom  the  englishman  was 
staring at a dog—the dog’s head angled back as if stunned by the screaming. hana looked over to carav

she crouched and hugged the animal, smelling its hair and the odour of hill grasses within it. she steered the dog towards 
caravaggio, who was offering it the heel of bread. the englishman saw caravaggio then and his jaw dropped. it must have 
seemed to him that the dog—now blocked by hana’s back —had turned into a man. caravaggio collected the dog in his arms 
and left the room. 

 
i have been thinking, the english patient said, that this must be poliziano’s room. this must have been his villa we are in. it 

is the water coming out of that wall, that ancient fountain. it is a famous room. they all met here. 

it was a hospital, she said quietly. before that, long before that a nunnery. then armies took it over. 
i think this was the villa bruscoli. poliziano—the great protege of lorenzo. i’m talking about 1483.

he was no longer young. how did she see him? with his wounds, his unbalance, the grey curls at the back of his neck. he 
had never imagined himself to be a man with a sense of age and wisdom. they had all grown older, but he still did not feel he 
had wisdom to go with his aging. 

he crouched down to watch the dog drinking and he rebalanced himself too late, grabbing the table, upsetting the carafe of 

wine. 

your name is david caravaggio, right? 
they had handcuffed him to the thick legs of an oak table. at one point he rose with it in his embrace, blood pouring away 
from his left hand, and tried to run with it through the thin door and falling. the woman stopped, dropping the knife, refusing 
to do more. the drawer of the table slid out and fell against his chest, and all its contents, and he thought perhaps there was a 
gun  that  he  could  use.  then  ranuccio  tommasoni  picked  up  the  razor  and  came  over  to  him.

she needed to move from the room. suddenly she was claustrophobic, untired. she strode down the hall and leapt down the 
stairs and went out onto the terrace of the villa, then looked up, as if trying to discern the figure of the girl she had stepped 
away from. she walked back into the building. she pushed at the stiff swollen door and came into the library and then removed 
the boards from the french doors at the far end of the room, opening them, letting in the night air. where caravaggio was, she 
didn’t know. he was out most evenings now, usually returning a few hours before dawn. in any case there was no sign of him.

went, crowded with aspidistra. she looked up and nodded towards them, an acknowledgement that she would stop now.

rifle which is always with him, even though battles seem now to be over for them. 

he has various postures  with the gun—half-staff, half a crook for his elbows  when it is over his shoulders. he  will turn, 
suddenly realizing she is watching him. he is a survivor of his fears, will step around anything suspicious, acknowledging her 
look in this panorama as if claiming he can deal with it all. 

he is a relief to her in his self-sufficiency, to all of them in the house, though caravaggio grumbles at the sapper’s contin-
uous  humming  of  western  songs  he  has  learned  for  himself  in  the  last  three  years  of  the  war.  the  other  sapper,  who  had 
arrived  with  him  in  the  rainstorm,  hardy  he  was  called,  is  billeted  elsewhere,  nearer  the  town,  though  she  has  seen  them 
working together, entering a garden with their wands of gad-getry to clear mines. 

the dog has stuck by caravaggio. the young soldier, who will run and leap with the dog along the

 path, refuses to give it 
food of any kind, feeling it should survive on its own. if he finds food he eats it himself. his courtesy goes only so far. some 
nights he sleeps on the parapet that overlooks the valley, crawling into his tent only if it rains. 

he, for his part, witnesses caravaggio’s wanderings at night. on two occasions the sapper trails caravaggio at a distance. 
but two days later caravaggio stops him and says, don’t follow me again. he begins to deny it, but the older man puts his 
hand across his lying face and quiets him. so the soldier knows caravaggio was aware of him two nights before. in any case, 
the trailing was simply a remnant of a habit he had been taught during the war. just as even now he desires to aim his rifle and 
fire and hit some target precisely. again and again he aims at a nose on a statue or one of the brown hawks veering across the 
sky of the valley.

he never speaks about  the danger that comes  with  his  kind of searching. now and then an explosion brings her and ca-
ravaggio quickly out of the house, her heart taut from the muffled blast. she runs out or runs to a window seeing cara-vaggio 
too in the corner of her vision, and they will see the sapper waving lazily towards the house, not even turning around from the 
herb terrace. 

once  caravaggio  entered  the  library  and  saw  the  sapper  up  by  the  ceiling,  against  the  trompe  1’oeil—only  caravaggio 
would walk into a room and look up into the high corners to see if he was alone—and the young soldier, his eyes not leaving 
their focus, put out his palm and snapped his fingers, halting caravaggio in his entrance, a warning to leave the room for safety 
as he unthreaded and cut a fuze wire he had traced to that corner, hidden above the valance.

beside his tent the antenna of a crystal set is strung up into the trees. she can see the phosphorus green from the radio dial if 
she looks over there at night with caravaggio’s field glasses, the sapper’s shifting body covering it up suddenly if he moves

caravaggio  is  familiar  with  this  state.  he  has  often  met  people  at  the  moondial.  disturbing  them  at  two  a.m.  as  a  whole 
bedroom  cupboard  came  crashing  down  by  mistake.  such  shocks,  he  discovered,  kept  them  away  from  fear  and  violence. 
disturbed by owners of houses he was robbing, he would clap his hands and converse frantically, flinging an expensive clock 
into the air and catching it in his hands, quickly asking them questions, about where things were.

after a week of the sikh sapper’s presence around the villa they adapted to his habits of eating. wherever he was—on the 
hill or in the village—he would return around twelve-thirty and join hana and caravaggio, pull out the small bundle of blue 
handkerchief  from  his  shoulder  bag  and  spread  it  onto  the  table  alongside  their  meal.  his  onions  and  his  herbs—  which 
caravaggio suspected he was taking from the franciscans’ garden during the time he spent there sweeping the place for mines. 
he peeled the onions with the same knife he used to strip rubber from a fuze wire. this was followed by fruit. caravaggio

the landscape around him is just a temporary thing, there is no permanence to it. he simply acknowledges the possibility of 
rain, a certain odour from a shrub. as if his mind, even when unused, is radar, his eyes locating the choreography of inanimate 
objects for the quarter-mile around him, which is the killing radius of small arms. he studies the two onions he has pulled out 
of the earth with care, aware that gardens too have been mined by retreating armies. 

at lunch there is caravaggio’s avuncular glance at the objects on the blue handkerchief. there is probably some rare animal,

they  pass  numerous  bonfires  on  the  sides  of  the  road  and  caravaggio  diverts  the  young  soldier’s  attention  to  them.  the 
sapper’s  nickname  is  kip.  “get  kip.”  “here  comes  kip.”  the  name  had  attached  itself  to  him  curiously.  in  his  first  bomb 
disposal report in england some butter had marked his paper, and the officer had exclaimed, “what’s this? kipper grease?” 
and laughter surrounded him. he had no idea what a kipper was, but the young sikh had been thereby translated into a salty

entrance as if his body were the axle of a wheel, as if the weapon had been sewn along his shoulders and arms and into his

the englishman turned to her and said, “we’re getting along famously!” 
she  was put out that the sapper had strolled casually into this domain, seemed able to surround her, be everywhere. kip, 
hearing from caravaggio that the patient knew about guns, had begun to discuss the search for bombs with the englishman. he 
had come up to the room and found him a reservoir of information about allied and enemy weaponry. the englishman not 
only knew about the absurd italian fuzes but also  knew the detailed topography of this  region of tuscany. soon  they  were 
drawing outlines of bombs for each other and talking out the theory of each specific circuit.

silent. he would get restless and kept interrupting the pauses and silences the englishman always allowed himself, trying to 
energize the train of thought. the soldier rolled his head back and looked at the ceiling. 

“what we should do is make a sling,” the sapper mused, turning to hana as she entered, “and carry him around the house.” 

she looked at both of them, shrugged and walked out of the room. 

when caravaggio passed her in the hall she was smiling. they stood in the hall and listened to the conversation inside the 

room.

stopping his car under one specific bridge in toronto north of pottery road at midnight and telling her that this was where the 
starlings and pigeons  uncomfortably and not  too happily  shared the rafters during the  night. so they  had paused there on a 
summer night and leaned their heads out into the racket of noise and sleepy chirpings.

“i wasn’t taken advantage of, was i?” adding, “just joking,” as she saw him beginning to blush. 
“do you want to go down to the house?” 
“yes, i’m hungry.” 
she could hardly stand up, the dazzle of sun, her tired legs. how long they had been there she still didn’t know. she could 

not forget the depth of her sleep, the lightness of the plummet. 

 
a party began in the english patient’s room when caravaggio revealed the gramophone he had found somewhere. 
“i  will  use it to teach  you to dance, hana. not  what  your  young  friend there knows. i  have  seen and turned  my back on 
certain  dances.  but  this  tune,  ‘how  long  has  this  been  going  on,’  is  one  of  the  great  songs  because  the  introduction’s 
melody is purer than the song it introduces. and only great jazzmen have acknowledged that. now, we can have this party on

“he dismantled a large bomb, a difficult one. let him tell you about it.” 
the sapper shrugged, not modestly, but as if it was too complicated to explain. night fell fast, night filled up the valley and 

then the mountains and they were left once more with lanterns. 

 
they were shuffling together in the corridors towards the english patient’s bedroom, caravaggio carrying the gramophone, 

one hand holding its arm and needle. 

“now, before you begin on your histories,” he said to the static figure in the bed, “i will present you with ‘my romance.’ 
“written in 1935 by mr. lorenz hart, i believe,” muttered the englishman. kip was sitting at the window, and she said she 

wanted to dance with the sapper. 

“not until i’ve taught you, dear worm.” 
she looked up at caravaggio strangely; that was her father’s term of endearment for her

it could have been a mine. he turned back to the party and said, “it’s all right, it wasn’t a mine. that seemed to come from a 
cleared area.” 

“turn the record over, kip. now i will introduce you to ‘how long has this been going on,’ written by—” he left an 
opening for the english patient, who was stymied, shaking his head, grinning with the wine in his mouth. “this alcohol will 
probably kill me.” “nothing will kill you, my friend. you are pure carbon.” “caravaggio!” 

“george and ira gershwin. listen.” 
he and hana were gliding to that sadness of the saxophone. he was right. the phrasing so slow, so drawn out, she could 
sense the musician did not wish to leave the small parlour of the introduction and enter the song, kept wanting to remain there,

 cheek rested against the muscles of caravaggio’s shoulder. she could feel those terrible paws on her back against the 
clean frock, and they moved in the limited space between the bed and the wall, between bed and door, between the bed and the 
window  alcove  that  kip  sat  within.  every  now  and  then  as  they  turned  she  would  see  his  face.  his  knees  up  and  his  arms 
resting on them. or he would be looking out of the window into darkness. 

“do any of you know a dance called the bosphorus hug?” the englishman asked.

“no such thing.” 
kip  watched  the  large  shadows  slide  over  the  ceiling,  over  the  painted  wall.  he  struggled  up  and  walked  to  the  english 
patient to fill his empty glass, and touched the rim of his glass with the bottle in a toast. west wind coming into the room. and 
he turned suddenly, angry. a frail scent of cordite reaching him, a percentage of it in the air, and then he slipped out of the 
room, gesturing weariness, leaving hana in the arms of caravaggio. 

 
there was no light with him as he ran along the dark hall. he scooped up the satchel, was out of the house and racing down 

the thirty-six chapel steps to the road, just running, cancelling the thought of exhaustion from his body. 

was it a sapper or was it a civilian? the smell of flower and herb along the road wall, the beginning stitch at his side. an 
accident or wrong choice. the sappers kept to themselves for the most part. they were an odd group as far as character went,

light from a storm, now and then the possible light from an explosion. the mountains and hills and florence blinded without 
electricity. candlelight travels less than fifty yards. from a greater distance there was nothing here that belonged to the outside 
world. they had celebrated in this evening’s brief dance in the english patient’s room their own simple adventures—hana her 
sleep,  caravaggio  his  “finding”  of  the  gramophone,  and  kip  a  difficult  defusing,  though  he  had  almost  forgotten  such  a 
moment already. he was someone who felt uncomfortable in celebrations, in victories. 

just fifty yards away, there had been no representation of them in the world, no sound or sight of them from the valley’s eye 
as hana’s and caravaggio’s shadows glided across the walls and kip sat comfortably encased in the alcove and the english 
patient sipped his wine and felt i

now, hours later, kip sits once again in the window alcove. if he could walk the seven yards across the englishman’s room 
and touch her he would be sane. there was so little light in the room, just the candle at the table where she sat, not reading 
tonight; he thought perhaps she was slightly drunk. 

he had returned from the source of the mine explosion to find caravaggio asleep on the library sofa with the dog in his arms. 
the hound watched him as he paused at the open door, moving as little of its body as it had to, to acknowledge it was awake 
and guarding the place. its quiet growl rising above caravaggio’s snore. 

he took off his boots, tied the laces together and slung them over his shoulder as he went upstairs. it had started to rain and 

he needed a tarpaulin for his tent. from the hall he saw the light still on in the english patient’s room.

for her he was just a silhouette, his slight body and his skin part of the darkness. 

earlier, when she saw that he had left the window alcove, she had been enraged. knowing that he was protecting them like 
children from the mine. she had clung closer to caravag-gio. it had been an insult. and tonight the growing exhilaration of the 
evening didn’t permit her to read after caravaggio had gone to bed, stopping to rifle through her medicine box first, and after 
the english patient had plucked at the air with his bony finger and, when she had bent over, kissed her cheek. 

she had blown out the other candles, lit just the night stub at the bedside table and sat there, the englishman’s body facing 
her in silence after the wildness of his drunken speeches. “sometime a horse i’ll be, sometime a hound. a hog, a headless bear, 
sometime a fire.” she could hear the spill o

reach of the hill where the explosion had taken place, and his unnecessary silence still angered her. 

she could not read. she sat in the room with her eternally dying man, the small of her back still feeling bruised from an 

accidental slam against the wall during her dance with caravaggio. 

 
now if he moves towards her she will stare him out, will treat him to a similar silence. let him guess, make a move. she has 

been approached before by soldiers. 

but what he does is this. he is halfway across the room, his hand sunk to the wrist in his open satchel which still hangs off 
his shoulder. his walk silent. he turns and pauses beside the bed. as the english patient completes one of his long exhalations 
he snips the wire of his hearing aid with the cutters and drops them back

“at least i have a name.” 
“yes.” 
caravaggio sits in hana’s chair. afternoon sun fills the room, revealing the swimming motes. the englishman’s dark lean 

face with its angular nose has the appearance of a still hawk swaddled in sheets. the coffin of a hawk, caravaggio thinks. 

the englishman turns to him. 
“there’s a painting by caravaggio, done late in his life. david with the head of goliath. in it, the young warrior holds at the 
end of his outstretched arm the head of goliath, ravaged and old. but that is not the true sadness in the picture. it is assumed 
that the face of david is a portrait of the youthful caravaggio and the head of goliath is a portrait of him as an older man, how 
he looked when he did the painting. youth judging age at the end

i think when i see him at the foot of my bed that kip is my david.” 

 
caravaggio sits there in silence, thoughts lost among the floating motes. war has unbalanced him and he can return to no 
other  world as  he is,  wearing these  false limbs that  morphine promises. he is a  man in  middle age  who has  never become 
accustomed to families. all his life he has avoided permanent intimacy. till this war he has been a better lover than husband. 
he has been a man who slips away, in the way lovers leave chaos, the way thieves leave reduced houses.

kip tried to imagine her as a bird. 
“tell me, is it possible to love someone who is not as smart as you are?” caravaggio, in a belligerent morphine rush, wanted 
the mood of argument. “this is something that has concerned me most of my sexual life—which began late, i must announce

“that’s a man talking,” muttered hana.

came to england for military training. has anyone, i wonder, fucked themselves into a corner. how old are you, kip?” 

“twenty-six.” 
“older than i am.” 
“older than hana. could you fall in love with her if she wasn’t smarter than you? i mean, she may not be smarter than you.

here caravaggio lifted up his hands, so they faced hana and kip. she got up and went behind him and put her arm around 

his neck. 

“don’t do this, okay, david?” 
she wrapped her hands softly around his. 
“we’ve already got one crazy talker upstairs.” 
“look at us—we sit here like the filthy rich in their filthy villas up in the filthy hills when the city gets too hot. it’s nine in

she writes everything down. then puts the fountain pen into the drawer of the small table where she keeps the book she is 
reading to him, along with two candles, vesta matches. there are no medical supplies in this room. she hides them in other 
rooms. if caravaggio is to hunt them out, she doesn’t want him disturbing the englishman. she puts the slip of paper with the 
names of plants into the pocket of her dress to give to caravaggio. now that physical attraction has raised its head, she has 
begun to feel awkward in the company of the three men.

they are only a step past the comfort she has given others in the temporary hospitals in ortona or monterchi. her body for 
last warmth, her whisper for comfort, her needle for sleep. but the sapper’s body allows nothing to enter him that comes from 
another world. a boy in love who will not eat the food she gathers, who does not need or want the drug in a needle she could 
slide into his arm, as caravaggio does, or those ointments of desert invention the englishman craves, ointments and pollen to

father told me once that caravaggio was a man always in love. not just in love but always sinking within it. always confused. 
always happy. kip? do you hear me? i’m so happy with you. to be with you like this.” 

 
most of all she wished for a river they could swim in. there was a formality in swimming which she assumed was like being 
in a ballroom. but he had a different sense of rivers, had entered the moro in silence and pulled the harness of cables attached

ed to silence the metals, and then the army marched over. drove over the 
prefabricated bridge with the sappers still in the water below. 

so often they were caught in midstream when the shells came, flaring into mudbanks breaking apart the steel and iron into 

stones. nothing would protect them then, the brown river thin as silk against metals that ripped through it. 

he turned from that.  he knew the trick of quick sleep against this one who had her own rivers and was lost from them. 
yes, caravaggio would explain to her how she could sink into love. even how to sink into cautious love. “i want to take you 
to the skootamatta river, kip,” she said. “i want to show you smoke lake. the woman my father loved lives out on the lakes, 
slips into canoes more easily than into a car. i miss thunder that blinks out electricity. i want you to meet clara of the canoes, 
the last one in my family. there are no others now. my father forsook her for a war.”

let me tell you a story,” caravaggio says to hana. “there was a hungarian named almasy, who worked for the germans 
during the war. he flew a bit with the afrika korps, but he was more valuable than that. in the 19305 he had been one of the 
great desert explorers. he knew every water hole and had helped map the sand sea. he knew all about the desert. he knew all 
about dialects. does this sound familiar? between the two wars he was always on expeditions out of cairo. one was to search 
for zerzura—the lost oasis. then when wa

“so?” 
“ ‘cicero’ was a code name for a spy. the british unearthed him. a double then triple agent. he got away. ‘zerzura’ is more 

complicated.” 

“i know about zerzura. he’s talked about it. he also talks about gardens.” 
“but it is mostly the desert now. the english garden is wearing thin. he’s dying. i think you have the spy-helper almasy 

upstairs.” 

they sit on the old cane hampers of the linen room looking at each other. caravaggio shrugs. “it’s possible.” 
“i  think  he  is  an  englishman,”  she  says,  sucking  in  her  cheeks  as  she  always  does  when  she  is  thinking  or  considering 

something about herself. 

“i know you love the man, but he’s not an englishman. in the early part of the war i was working in cairo—the tripoli

“what do you mean, ‘rebecca spy’?” 
“in 1942 the germans sent a spy called eppler into cairo before the battle of el alame

caravaggio said, “i’d like to talk with him some more. with more morphine in him. talking it out. both of us. do you 

understand? to see where it will all go. delilah. zerzura. you will have to give him the altered shot.” 

“no, david. you’re too obsessed. it doesn’t matter who he is. the war’s over.”

she watched him sitting on the hamper, clear-eyed, smiling. during the last stages of the war caravaggio had become one of 
the  numerous  morphia  thieves.  he  had  sniffed  out  her  medical  supplies  within  hours  of  his  arrival.  the  small  tubes  of 
morphine were now a source for him. like toothpaste tubes for dolls, she had thought when she first saw them, finding them 
utterly quaint. caravaggio carried two or three in his pocket all day long, slipping the fluid into his flesh. she had stumbled on

away, glaring in anger.

shaped into arms uncoiling around him. limbs begin disappearing in the suck of air. the odour of morphine on his tongue. 
caravaggio reflected in the black lake of his eye. he goes up and down now like a well bucket. there is blood somehow all 
over his face. he is flying a rotted plane, the canvas sheetings on the wings ripping open in the speed. they are carrion. how 
far back had the palm tree been? how long ago? he lifts his legs out of the oil, but they are so heavy. there is no way he can

he is sitting on the counter in the  kitchen talking  with hana. caravaggio breezes through it on his  way out, heavy ropes 
swathed over his shoulders, which are his own personal business, as he says when anyone asks him. he drags them behind him 
and as he goes out the door says, “the english patient wants to see you, boyo.” 

“okay, boyo.” the sapper hops off the counter, his indian accent slipping over into the false welsh of caravaggio.

in the library the fuze box is in midair, nudged off the counter by caravaggio when he turned to hana’s gleeful yell in the 

hall. before it reaches the floor kip’s body slides underneath it, and he catches it in his hand. 

caravaggio glances down to see the young man’s face blowing out all the air quickly through his cheeks. 
he thinks suddenly he owes him a life. 
kip begins to laugh, losing his shyness in front of the older man, holding up the box of wires.

“i know all about sarongs.” caravaggio waved his hand towards kip and hana as he spoke. “in the east end of toronto i met 
these indians. i was robbing a house and it turned out to belong to an indian family. they woke from their beds and they were 
wearing these cloths, sarongs, to sleep in, and it intrigued me. we had lots to talk about and they eventually persuaded me to 
try it. i removed my clothes and stepped into one, and they immediately set upon me and chased me half naked into the night.” 

“is that a true story?”

“one of many!” 
she knew enough about him to almost believe it. caravaggio was constantly diverted by the human element during burglar-
ies. breaking into a house during christmas, he would become annoyed if he noticed the advent calendar had not been opened 
up to the date to which it should have been. he often had conversations with the various pets left alone in houses, rhetorically 
discussing  meals  with  them,  feeding  them  large  helpings,  and  was  often  greeted  by  them  with  considerable  pleasure  if  he 
returned to the scene of a crime.

they were in the habit of rising with daybreak and eating dinner in the last available light. throughout the late evening there 
would be only one candle flaring into the darkness beside the english patient, or a lamp half filled with oil if caravaggio had 
managed to forage any. but the corridors and other bedrooms hung in darkness, as if in a buried city. they became used to 
walking in darkness, hands out, touching the walls on either side with their fingertips. 

“no more light. no more colour.” hana would sing the phrase to herself again and again. kip’s unnerving habit of leaping 
down the stairs one hand halfway down the rail had to be stopped. she imagined his feet travelling through air and hitting the

during those final nights in cairo, months after the affair was over, we had finally persuaded madox into a zinc bar for his 
farewell. she and her husband were there. one last night. one last dance. almasy was drunk and attempting an old dance step 
he had invented called the bosphorus hug, lifting katharine clifton into his wiry arms and traversing the floor until he fell with 
her across some nile-grown aspidistras. 

 
who is he speaking as now? caravaggio thinks. 
 
almasy was drunk and his dancing seemed to the others a brutal series of movements. in those days he and she did not seem 
to be getting on well. he swung her from side to side as if she were some anonymous doll, and smothered with drink his grief 
at madox’s leaving. he was loud at the tables with us. when almasy was like this we usually dispersed, but this was madox’s 
last night in cairo and we stayed. a bad egyptian violinist mimicking stephane grappelly, and almasy like a pl

when he opens his eyes again, madox is there, looking ragged, weary, carrying the morphinic injection, having to use both 
hands because there are no thumbs. how does he give it to himself? he thinks. he recognizes the eye, the habit of the tongue 
fluttering at the lip, the clearness of the man’s brain catching all he says. two old coots. 

caravaggio watches the pink in the man’s mouth as he talks. the gums perhaps the light iodine colour of the rock paintings 
discovered in uweinat. there is more to discover, to divine out of this body on the bed, nonexistent except for a mouth, a vein 
in the arm, wolf-grey eyes. he is still amazed at the clarity of discipline in the man, who speaks sometimes in the first person, 
sometimes in the third person, who still does not admit that he is almasy.

all day they have shared the ampoules of morphine. to unthread the story out of him, caravaggio travels within the code of 
signals. when the burned man slows down, or when caravaggio feels he is not catching everything—the love affair, the death 
of madox—he picks up the syringe from the kidney-shaped enamel tin, breaks the glass tip off an ampoule with the pressure of 
a knuckle and loads it. he is blunt about all this now with hana, having ripped the sleeve off his left arm completely. almasy 
wears just a grey singlet, so his black arm lies bare under the sheet.

caravaggio picks up the herodotus. he turns a page, comes over a dune to discover the gilf kebir, uweinat, gebel kissu. 
when  almasy  speaks  he  stays  alongside  him  reordering  the  events.  only  desire  makes  the  story  errant,  flickering  like  a 
compass  needle.  and  this  is  the  world  of  nomads  in  any  case,  an  apocryphal  story.  a  mind  travelling  east  and  west  in  the

caravaggio  wants to rise and walk away from this villa, the country, the detritus of a war. he is just a thief. what cara-

the rectangle of light that had drifted up caravaggio’s chair was framing his chest and head so that to the english patient the

“i can talk with you, caravaggio, because i feel we are both mortal. the girl, the boy, they are not mortal yet. in spite of 

what they have been through. hana was greatly distressed when i first met her.” 

“her father was killed in france.”

“thieves like us were used a great deal during this war. we were legitimized. we stole. then some of us began to advise.

the rhomboid of light moved up the wall leaving caravaggio in shadow. his hair dark again. he leaned back, his shoulder 

against the foliage. 

 
“i suppose it doesn’t matter,” almasy murmured. 
“do you want morphine?” 
“no. i’m putting things into place. i was always a private man. it is difficult to realize i was so discussed.”

his face and his trunk filled out and this greyness in him, he was a friendlier human. 

 
tonight dinner was being prepared by the sapper. caravaggio was not looking forward to it. one meal in three was a loss as

his pocket.

“you’re surrounded by madmen...” 
“yes, i think we are all mad.” 
when kip called them, they walked out of the kitchen and onto the terrace, whose border, with its low stone balustrade, was 

ringed with light. 

it looked to caravaggio like a string of small electric candles found in dusty churches, and he thought the sapper had gone 
too far in removing them from a chapel, even for hana’s birthday. hana walked slowly forward with her hands over her face. 
there was no wind. her legs and thighs moved through the skirt of her frock as if it were thin water. her tennis shoes silent on 
the stone. 

“i kept finding dead shells wherever i was digging,” the sapper said. 
they  still  didn’t  understand.  caravaggio  bent

along the row of them; there must have been about forty. 

“forty-five,” kip said, “the years so far of this century. where i come from, we celebrate the age as well as ourselves.” 
hana moved alongside them, her hands in her pockets now, the way kip loved to see her walk. so relaxed, as if she had put 

her arms away for the night, now in simple armless movement. 

caravaggio  was diverted by the startling presence of three bottles of red wine on the table. he  walked over and read the 
labels and shook his head, amazed. he knew the sapper wouldn’t drink any of it. all three had already been opened. kip must 
have picked his way through some etiquette book in the library. then he saw the corn and the meat and the potatoes. hana slid 
her arm into kip’s and came with him to the table.

ongues. they were soon turning silly in their 
toasts to the sapper—”the great forager”—and to the english patient. they toasted each other, kip joining in with his beaker of 
water. this was when he began to talk about himself. caravaggio pressing him on, not always listening, sometimes standing up 
and walking around the table, pacing and pacing with pleasure at all this. he wanted these two married, longed to force them 
verbally towards it, but they seemed to have their own strange rules about their relationship. what was he doing in this role. he 
sat down again. now and then he noticed the death of a light. the snail shells held only so much oil. kip would rise and refill 
them with pink paraffin. 

“we must keep them lit

 till midnight.” 
they talked then about the war, so far away. “when the war with japan is over, everyone will finally go home,” kip said. 
“and where will you go?” caravaggio asked. the sapper rolled his head, half nodding, half shaking it, his mouth smiling. so 
caravaggio began to talk, mostly to kip. 

the  dog  cautiously  approached  the  table  and  laid  its  head  on  caravaggio’s  lap.  the  sapper  asked  for  other  stories  about 
toronto as if it were a place of peculiar wonders. snow that drowned the city, iced up the harbour, ferryboats in the summer 
where  people  listened  to  concerts.  but  what  he  was  really  interested  in  were  the  clues  to  hana’s  nature,  though  she  was 
evasive, veering caravaggio away from stories that involved some moment of her life. she wanted kip to know her only in the 
present, a person perhaps more flawed or more

had  been  then.  in  her  life  there  was  her  mother  alice  her  father  patrick  her  stepmother  clara  and  caravaggio.  she  had 
already admitted these names to kip as if they were her credentials, her dowry. they were faultless and needed no discussion. 
she used them like authorities in a book she could refer to on the right way to boil an egg, or the correct way to slip garlic into 
a lamb. they were not to be questioned.

and now—because he was quite drunk—caravaggio told the story of hana’s singing the “marseillaise,” which he had told 
her before. “yes, i have heard the song,” said k

the table beside her bare feet. 

“this is for you. this is how you must learn to sing it, kip. this is for you.” 
she sang up into darkness beyond their snail light, beyond the square of light from the english patient’s room and into the 

dark sky waving with shadows of cypress. her hands came out of their pockets. 

kip had heard the song in the camps, sung by groups of men, often during strange moments, such as before an impromptu 
soccer match. and caravaggio when he had heard it in the last few years of the war never really liked it, never liked to listen to 
it. in his heart he had hana’s version from many years before. now he listened with a pleasure because she was singing again, 
but this  was quickly altered by the  way she  sang. not the passion of  her at  sixteen but echoing the  tentative circle  of light 
around her in the darkness. she was singing it as if it was something scarred, as if one couldn’t ever again bring all the hope of

the song together. it had been altered by the five years leading to this night of her twenty-first birthday in the forty-fifth year of 
the  twentieth  century.  singing  in  the  voice  of  a  tired  traveller,  alone  against  everything.  a  new  testament.  there  was  no 
certainty  to  the  song  anymore,  the  singer  could  only  be  one  voice  against  all  the  mountains  of  power.  that  was  the  only 
sureness. the one voice was the single unspoiled thing. a song of snail light. caravaggio realized she was singing with and 
echoing the heart of the sapper. 

 
in the tent there have been nights of no talk and nights full of talk. they are never sure what will occur, whose fraction of 
past will emerge, or whether touch will be anonymous and silent in their darkness. the intimacy of her body or the body of her 
language in his ear—as they lie upon the air pillow he insists on blowing up and using each night. he has been charmed by this 
western  invention.  he  dutifully  releas

during the evenings thunderstorms roll over tuscany. lightning drops towards any metal or spire that rises up out of the 

landscape. kip always returns to the villa along the yellow path between the cypresses around seven in the evening, which is 
when the thunder, if there is going to be thunder, begins. the mediaeval experience. 

he seems to like such temporal habits. she or caravaggio will see his figure in the distance, pausing in his walk home to 
look back towards the valley to see how far away the rain is from him. hana and caravaggio return to the house. kip continues 
his half-mile uphill walk on the path that curls slowly to the right and then slowly to the left. there is the noise of his boots on 
the gravel. the wind reaches him in bursts, hitting the cypresses broadside so they tilt, entering the sleeves of his shirt.

full of fire. it rolls across cities like a burst map, the hurricane of heat withering bodies as it 
meets them, the shadow of humans suddenly in the air. this tremor of western wisdom. 

he watches the english patient, earphones on, the eyes focused inwards, listening. the rifle sight moves down the thin nose 

to the adam’s apple, above the collarbone. kip stops breathing. braced at exact right angles to the enfield rifle. no waver.

caravaggio enters the room and reaches for him, and kip wheels the butt of the rifle into his ribs. a swat from the paw of an 
animal.  and  then,  as  if  part  of  the  same  movement,  he  is  back  in  the  braced  right-angle  position  of  those  in  firing  squads, 
drilled into him in various barracks in india and england. the burned neck in his sights.

i’ll leave you the radio to swallow your history lesson. don’t move again, caravaggio. all those speeches of civilisation 

from kings and queens and presidents... such voices of abstract order. smell it. listen to the radio and smell the celebration in 
it. in my country, when a father breaks justice in two, you kill the father.

sees hana on the periphery. 

the burned man untugs the earphones off his head and slowly places them down in front of him. then his left hand reaches 

up and pulls away the hearing aid, and drops it to the floor. 

do it, kip. i don’t want to hear any more. 
he closes his eyes. slips into darkness, away from the room. 
 
the sapper leans against the wall, his hands folded, head down. caravaggio can hear air being breathed in and out of his 

nostrils, fast and hard, a piston. 

he isn’t an englishman. 
american, french, i don’t care. when you start bombing the brown races of the world, you’re an englishman. you had king 

leopold of belgium and now you have fucking harry truman of the usa. you all learned it from the english. 

no. not him. mistake. of all people he is probably on your side. 
he would say that doesn’t matter, hana says.

s always, he thinks, sitting in this chair. in the room there is the thin squawking from 
the crystal set, the radio still speaking in its underwater voice. he cannot bear to turn and look at the sapper or look towards the 
blur of hana’s frock. he knows the young soldier is right. they would never have dropped such a bomb on a white nation. 

the sapper walks out of the room, leaving caravaggio and hana by the bed. he has left the three of them to their world, is 
no longer their sentinel. in the future, if and when the patient dies, caravaggio and the girl will bury him. let the dead bury the 
dead. he has never been sure what that meant. those few callous words in the bible. 

they will bury everything except the book. the body, the sheets, his clothes, the rifle. soon he will be alone with hana. and

while  the  sapper  unearthed  the  motorcycle  from  under  the  tarpaulin,  caravaggio  leaned  forward  on  the  parapet,  his  chin 
against his forearm. then he felt he couldn’t bear the mood of the house and walked away. he wasn’t there when the sapper 
gunned the motorbike to life and sat on it while it half bucked, alive under him, and hana stood nearby. 
singh touched her arm and let the machine roll away, down the slope, and only then revved it to life.

the motorbike when the boy slowed down, as caravaggio walked into his path. caravaggio came up to him and put his arms 
around  him.  a  great  hug.  the  sapper  felt  the  stubble  against  his  skin  for  the  first  time.  he  felt  drawn  in,  gathered  into  the 
muscles. “i shall have to learn how to miss you,” caravaggio said. then the boy pulled away and caravaggio walked back to 
the house. 

 
the machine broke into life around him. the smoke of the triumph and dust and fine gravel fell away through the trees. the 
bike leapt the cattle grid at the gates, and then he was weaving down out of the village, passing the smell of gardens on either 
side of him that were tacked onto the slopes in their treacherous angle. 

his body slipped into a position of habit, his chest parallel with, almost touching, the petrol tank, his arms horizontal in the 
shape of

caravaggio has made a one-strand bridge with hemp rope down to the roof of the next villa. the rope is tightened at this end 
round the waist of the statue of demetrius and then secured to the well. the rope barely higher than the tops of the two olive 
trees along his path. if he loses his balance he will fall into the rough dusty arms of the olive. 

he steps onto it, his socked feet gripping the hemp. how valuable is that statue? he once asked hana casually, and she told

she seals the letter and stands up, moves across the room to close the window, and at that moment lightning slips through the 
valley. she sees caravaggio in midair halfway across the gorge that lies like a deep scar alongside the villa. she stands there as 
if in one of her dreams, then climbs into the window alcove and sits there looking out. 

every time there is lightning, rain freezes in the suddenly lit night. she sees the buzzard hawks flung up into the sky, looks 

for caravaggio.

triggers him back to the months he spent with hana and caravaggio and the english patient north of florence in the villa san 
girolamo. he is a doctor, has two children and a laughing wife. he is permanently busy in this city. at six p.m. he removes his 
white lab coat. underneath he wears dark trousers and a short-sleeved shirt. he closes up the clinic, where all the paperwork 
has weights of various kinds—stones, inkpots, a toy truck his son no longer plays with—to keep it from being blown away by
