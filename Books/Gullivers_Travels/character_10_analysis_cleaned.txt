[CHARACTER]

don pedro is a minor character in terms of plot, but he
plays an important symbolic role at the end of the novel. he treats
the half-deranged gulliver with great patience, even tenderness,
when he allows him to travel on his ship as far as lisbon, offering
to give him his own finest suit of clothes to replace the seaman's
tatters, and giving him twenty pounds for his journey home to england.
don pedro never judges gulliver, despite gulliver's abominably antisocial behavior
on the trip back. ironically, though don pedro shows the same kind
of generosity and understanding that gulliver's houyhnhnm master
earlier shows him, gulliver still considers don pedro a repulsive
yahoo. were gulliver able to escape his own delusions, he might
be able to see the houyhnhnm-like reasonableness and kindness in
don pedro's behavior. don pedro is thus the touchstone through which
we see that gulliver is no longer a reliable and objective commentator
on the reality he sees but, rather, a skewed observer of a reality
colored by private delusions.
