    what means this warning of this trumpet's sound?

  gen.  this tells me that your grace's men of war,
    such as war's fortune hath reserv'd from death,
    come marching on towards your royal seat,
    to show themselves before your majesty;
    for so gave i in charge at my depart.
    whereby by demonstration shall appear
    that all, except three hundred or few more,
    are safe return'd and by their foes enrich'd.

                  the army enters, balthazar between lorenzo
                  and horatio, captive.

  king.  a gladsome sight!  i long to see them here.

                  they enter and pass by.

    was that the warlike prince of portingal
    that by our nephew was in triumph led?

  gen.  it was, my liege, the prince of portingal.

  king.  but what was he that on the other side
    held him by th' arm as partner of the prize?

  hiero.  that was my son, my gracious sovereign;
    of whom though from his tender infancy
    my loving thoughts did ne

    i'll love horatio, my andrea's friend,
    the more to spite the prince that wrought his end;
    and, where don balthazar, that slew my love,
    himself now pleads for favor at my hands,
    he shall, in rigour of my just disdain,
    reap long repentance for his murderous deed,--
    for what was't else but murderous cowardice,
    so many to oppress one valiant knight,
    without respect of honour in the fight?
    and here he comes that murder'd my delight.

                enter lorenzo and balthazar.

  lor.  sister, what means this melancholy walk?

  bel.  that for a-while i wish no company.

  lor.  but here the prince is come to visit you.

  bel.  that argues that he lives in liberty.

  bal.  no madam, but in pleasing servitude.

  bel.  your prison then, belike, is your conceit.

  bal.  aye, by conceit my freedom is enthrall'd.

  bel.  then with conceit enlarge yourself again.

  bal.  what if conceit have laid my heart to gage?

    their love to mortal hate, their day to night,
    their hope into despair, their peace to war,
    their joys to pain, their bliss to misery.

  lorenzo.  my lord, though bel-imperia seem thus coy,
    let reason hold you in your wonted joy:
    in time the savage bull sustains the yoke,
    in time all haggard hawks will stoop to lure,
    in time small wedges cleave the hardest oak,
    in time the flint is pierc'd with softest shower;
    and she in time will fall from her disdain,
    and rue the sufferance of your friendly pain.

[the duke's castle]

                enter horatio and bel-imperia.

  hor.  now, madame, since by favour of your love
    our hidden smoke is turn'd to open flame,
    and that with looks and words we feed our thought,--
    two chief contents where more cannot be had,--
    thus in the midst of love's fair blandishments
    why show you sign of inward languishments?

                pedringano showeth all to the prince and
                lorenzo, placing them in secret.

  bel.  my heart, sweet friend, is like a ship at sea:
    she wisheth port, where, riding all at ease,
    she may repair what stormy times have worn,
    and, leaning on the shore, may sing with joy
    that pleasure follows pain, and bliss annoy.
    possession of thy love is th' only port
    wherein my heart, with fears and hopes long toss'd,
    each hour doth wish and long to make resort,
    there to repair the joys that it hath lost,
    and, sitting safe, to

 that in darkness pleasures may be done,
    come, bel-imperia, let us to the bower,
    and there is safety pass a pleasant hour.

  bel.  i follow thee, my love, and will not back,
    although my fainting heart controls my soul.

  hor.  why, make you doubt of pedringano's faith?

  bel.  no; he is as trusty as my second self.
    go, pedringano, watch without the gate,
    and let us know if any make approach.

  ped.  [aside]  instead of watching, i'll deserve more gold
    by fetching don lorenzo to this match.

                exit pedringano.

  hor.  what means my love?

  bel.                          i know not what, myself;
    and yet my heart foretells me some mischance.

  hor.  sweet, say not so; fair fortune is our friend,
    and heav'ns have shut up day to pleasure us.
    the stars, thou see'st, hold back their twinkling shine
    and luna hides herself to pleasure us.

  bel. thou hast prevail'd!  i'll conquer my misdoubt,
    and in thy love and counsel drown my fear.

  bel.  nay then, to gain the glory of the field,
    my twining arms shall yoke and make thee yield.

  hor.  nay then, my arms are large and strong withal:
    thus elms by vines are compass'd till they fall.

  bel.  o, let me go, for in my troubled eyes
    now may'st thou read that life in passion dies!

  hor.  o, stay a-while, and i will die with thee;
    so shalt thou yield, and yet have conquer'd me.

  bel.  who's there?  pedringano?  we are betray'd!

                enter lorenzo, balthazar, serberine,
                pedringano, disguised.

  lor.  my lord, away with her!  take her aside!
    o sir, forbear, your valour is already tried.
    quickly dispatch, my masters.

                they hang him in the arbor.

  hor.                          what, will you murder me?

  lor.  aye; thus!  and thus!  these are the fruits of love!

                they stab him.

    a letter for hieronimo.
    [reads]  "for want of ink receive this bloody writ.
    me hath my hapless brother hid from thee.
    revenge thyself on balthazar and him,
    for these were they that murdered thy son.
    hieronimo, revenge horatio's death,

    what means this unexpected miracle?
    my son slain by lorenzo and the prince?
    what cause had they horatio to malign?
    or what might move thee, bel-imperia,
    to accuse thy brother, had he been the mean?
    hieronimo, beware!  thou art betray'd,
    and to entrap thy life this train is laid.
    advise thee therefore, be not credulous:
    this is devised to endanger thee,
    that thou, by this, lorenzo should'st accuse.
    and he, for thy dishonour done, should draw
    thy life in question and thy name in hate.

  hiero.                my lord.

  lor.  what to do, hieronimo?  use me.

  hiero.  oh, no, my lord, i dare not, it must not be;
    i humbly thank your lordship.

  lor.                          why then, farewell!

    so near the duke his brother's house before.

    for here did don lorenzo's page appoint
    that thou by his command shouldst meet with him.
    how fit a place, if one were so dispos'd,
    methinks this corner is to close with one.

  ped. [aside]  here comes the bird that i must seize upon;
    now, pedringano, or never play the man!

  ser.  [aside]  i wonder that his lordship stays so long,
    or wherefore should he send for me so late.

    to bring the murder'd body with us too.

  lor.  fear of preventing our mishaps too late.

  bal.  what mischief is it that we not mistrust?

  lor. our greatest ills we least mistrust, my lord,
    and unexpected harms do hurt us most.

  bal.  why, tell me, don lorenz,--tell me, man,

    of former evils, easily cannot err:
    i am persuaded--and dissuade me not--
    that all's revealed to hieronimo.
    and therefore know that i have cast it thus--

  lor.  hath pedringano murder'd serberine?
    my lord, let me entreat you to take the pains
    to exasperate and hasten his revenge
    with your complaints unto my lord the king.
    this their dissension breeds a greater doubt.

  bal.  assure thee, don lorenzo, he shall die,
    or else his highness hardly shall deny.
    meanwhile, i'll haste the marshall sessions,
    for die he shall for this his damned deed.

    for, were he ready to be turned off,--
    as 'tis my will the uttermost be tried,--
    thou with his pardon shalt attend him still.
    show him this box, tell him his pardon's in't;

    you know, my lord, i slew him for your sake,
    and was confed'rate with the prince and you;

  king.  who is that?  hieronimo?

  hiero.  justice!  o justice!  o my son!  my son!
    my son, whom naught can ransom or redeem!

  lor.  hieronimo, you are not well advis'd.

  hiero.  away, lorenzo!  hinder me no more,
    for thou hast made me bankrupt of my bliss!
    give me my son!  you shall not ransom him!
    away!  i'll rip the bowels of the earth,

    and ferry over th' elysian plains
    and bring my son to show his deadly wounds.

    and here surrender up my marshallship;
    for i'll go marshall up the fiends in hell,
    to be avenged on you all for this.

                lorenzo, balthazar, don pedro, and bel-imperia.

  king.  go, brother, 'tis the duke of castile's cause;
    salute the viceroy in our name.

  castile.                      i go.

  vice.  go forth, don pedro, for thy nephew's sake,
    and greet the duke of castile.

  pedro.                        it shall be so.

    kings and commanders of the western indies.

    here, take my crown, i give it to her and thee,
    and let me live a solitary life,
    in ceaseless prayers,
    to think how strangely heav'n hath thee preserved.

  king.  see, brother, see, how nature strives in him!
    come, worthy viceroy, and accompany
    thy friend, to strive with thine extremities:
    a place more private fits this princely mood.

  vice.  or here or where your highness thinks it good.

  cas.  nay, stay, lorenzo; let me talk with you.
    see'st thou this entertainment of these kings?

  lor.  i do, my lord, and joy to see the same.

  cas.  and know'st thou why this meeting is?

  lor.  for her, my lord, whom balthazar doth love,
    and to confirm their promis'd marriage.

  cas.  she is thy sister.

  lor.                  who?  bel-imperia?
    aye, my gracious lord, and this is the day
    that i have long'd so happily to see.

  lor.  heav'ns will not let lorenzo err so much.

  cas.  why then, lorenzo, listen to my words:
    it is suspected, and reported too,
    that thou, lorenzo, wrong'st hieronimo,
    and in his suits toward his majesty
    still keep'st him back and seek'st to cross his suit.

  lor.  that i, my lord?

  cas.  i tell thee, son, myself have heard it said,
    when to my sorrow i have been asham'd
    to answer for thee, though thou art my son.
    lorenzo, know'st thou not the common love
    and kindness that hieronimo hath won
    by his deserts within the court of spain?
    or see'st thou not the king my brother's care

    lorenzo, should'st thou thwart his passions,

    what honour were't in this assembly,
    or what a scandal were't among the kings,
    to hear hieronimo exclaim on thee!
    tell me,--and look thou tell me truly too,--
    whence grows the ground of this report in court?

  lor.  my lord, it lies not in lorenzo's power
    to stop the vulgar, liberal of their tongues:
    a small advantage makes a water-breach;
    and no man lives that long contenteth all.

  cas.  myself have seen thee busy to keep back
    him and his supplications from the king.

  lor.  yourself, my lord, hath seen his passions,
    that ill beseem'd the presence of a king;
    and, for i pitied him in his distress,
    i held him thence with kind and courteous words,

  lor.  my gracious father, believe me, so he doth;
    but what's a silly man, distract in mind,
    to think upon the murder of his son?
    alas, how easy is it for him to err!
    but, for his satisfaction and the world's,
    'twere good, my lord, that hieronimo and i
    were reconcil'd, if he misconstrue me.

  cas.  lorenzo, that hast said; it shall be so!
    go, one of you, and call hieronimo.

                enter balthazar and bel-imperia.

    my sorrow's ease, and sovereign of my bliss,--
    sith heav'n hath ordain'd thee to be mine,
    disperse those clouds and melancholy looks,
    and clear them up with those thy sun-bright eyes,

    you find yourself aggrieved at my son,
    because you have not access unto the king,
    and say 'tis he that intercepts your suits.

  hiero.  why, is not this a miserable thing, my lord?

  cas.  hieronimo, i hope you have no cause,
    and would be loath that one of your deserts
    should once have reason to suspect my son,
    considering how i think of you myself.

  hiero.  your son lorenzo?  whom, my noble lord?
    the hope of spain? mine honourable friend?
    grant me the combat of them, if they dare!

                draws out his sword.

    i'll meet them face-to-face to tell me so!
    these be the scandalous reports of such
    as love not me, and hate my lord too much.
    should i suspect lorenzo would prevent
    or cross my suit, that lov'd my son so well?
    my lord, i am asham'd it should be said.

    here lay my hope, and here my hope hath end;
    here lay my heart, and here my heart was slain;
    here lay my treasure, here my treasure lost;
    here lay my bliss, and here my bliss bereft.
    but hope, heart, treasure, joy and bliss,--
    all fled, fail'd, died, yea, all decay'd with this.
    from forth these wounds came breath that gave me life;
    they murder'd me that made these fatal marks.
    the cause was love whence grew this mortal hate:
    the hate, lorenzo and young balthazar;
    the love, my son to bel-imperia.
    but night, the cov'rer of accursed crimes,
    with pitchy silence hush'd these traitors' harms,
    and lent them leave--for they had sorted leisure--
    to take advantage in my garden plot
    upon my son, my dear horatio.
    there merciless they butcher'd up my boy,
    in black, dark night, to pale, dim, cruel death!

    and never hath it left my bloody heart,
    soliciting remembrance of my vow

    which now perform'd, my heart is satisfied.
    and to this end the bashaw i became,
    that might revenge me on lorenzo's life,
    who therefore was appointed to the part
    and was to represent the knight of rhodes,
    that i might kill him more conveniently.
    so, viceroy, was this balthazar thy son--
    that suleiman which bel-imperia
    in person of perseda murdered,--
    solely appointed to that tragic part,
    that she might slay him that offended her.
