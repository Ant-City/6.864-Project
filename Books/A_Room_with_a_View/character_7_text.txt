 you would have him all the evening, as
well as all dinner-time.â€

â€œhe is nice,â€ exclaimed lucy. â€œjust what i remember. he seems to see
good in everyone. no one would take him for a clergyman.â€

â€œmy dear lucia--â€

â€œwell, you know what i mean. and you know how clergymen generally laugh;
mr. beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.â€

â€œfunny girl! how you do remind me of your mother. i wonder if she will
approve of mr. beebe.â€

â€œiâ€™m sure she will; and so will freddy.â€

â€œi think everyone at windy corner will approve; it is the fashionable
world. i am used to tunbridge wells, where we are all hopelessly behind
the times.â€

â€œyes,â€ said lucy despondently.

there was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval
was of herself, or of mr. beebe, or of the fashionable world at windy
corner, or of the narrow world at tunbridge wells, she could not
determine. she tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered. miss

â€œindeed, iâ€™m not!â€ exclaimed lucy. â€œwe are radicals, too, out and out.
my father always voted for mr. gladstone, until he was so dreadful about
ireland.â€

â€œi see, i see. and now you have gone over to the enemy.â€

â€œoh, please--! if my father was alive, i am sure he would vote radical
again now that ireland is all right. and as it is, the glass over our
front door was broken last election, and freddy is sure it was the
tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.â€

â€œshameful! a manufacturing district, i suppose?â€

â€œno--in the surrey hills. about five miles from dorking, looking over
the weald.â€

miss lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.

â€œwhat a delightful part; i know it so well. it is full of the very
nicest people. do you know sir harry otway--a radical if ever there
was?â€

â€œvery well indeed.â€

â€œand old mrs. butterworth the philanthropist?â€

faint flush of pleasure
that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of lucy. how
abominably she behaved to charlotte, now as always! but now she should
alter. all morning she would be really nice to her.

she slipped her arm into her cousinâ€™s, and they started off along the
lungâ€™ arno. the river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and
colour. miss bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at
it. she then made her usual remark, which was â€œhow i do wish freddy and
your mother could see this, too!â€

lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of charlotte to have stopped exactly
where she did.

â€œlook, lucia! oh, you are watching for the torre del gallo party. i
feared you would repent you of your choice.â€

serious as the choice had been, lucy did not repent. yesterday had been
a muddle--queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down
easily on paper--but she had a feeling that charlotte and her shopping
were preferable to george emerson

 the girls. miss lucy, you are to go. we wish to
converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.â€

the girl was stubborn. as her time at florence drew to its close she was
only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent. such a one was
miss lavish, and such for the moment was charlotte. she wished she had
not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her remark
and seemed determined to get rid of her.

â€œhow tired one gets,â€ said miss bartlett. â€œoh, i do wish freddy and your
mother could be here.â€

unselfishness with miss bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of
enthusiasm. lucy did not look at the view either. she would not enjoy
anything till she was safe at rome.

â€œthen sit you down,â€ said miss lavish. â€œobserve my foresight.â€

with many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that
protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
she sat on one; who was to sit on the other?

which lay upon the piano. from time to time he bounced in his chair and
puffed and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the
human frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter,
did continually read out to him what she had written. and continually
did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of
light fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still
there.

â€œwhere arenâ€™t they?â€ said the boy, who was freddy, lucyâ€™s brother. â€œi
tell you iâ€™m getting fairly sick.â€

â€œfor goodnessâ€™ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?â€ cried mrs.
honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it
literally.

freddy did not move or reply.

â€œi think things are coming to a head,â€ she observed, rather wanting
her sonâ€™s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue
supplication.

â€œi didnâ€™t mean to be unkind.â€ then he added: â€œbut i do think lucy might
have got this off her chest in italy. i donâ€™t know how girls manage
things, but she canâ€™t have said â€˜noâ€™ properly before, or she wouldnâ€™t
have to say it again now. over the whole thing--i canâ€™t explain--i do
feel so uncomfortable.â€

â€œdo you indeed, dear? how interesting!â€

â€œi feel--never mind.â€

he returned to his work.

â€œi said: â€˜dear mrs. vyse, cecil has just asked my permission about
it, and i should be delighted, if lucy wishes it. but--â€™â€ she stopped
reading, â€œi was rather amused at cecil asking my permission at all. he
has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so
forth. when it comes to the point, he canâ€™t get on without me.â€

â€œnor me.â€

â€œyou?â€

freddy nodded.

â€œwhat do you mean?â€

â€œhe asked me for my permission also.â€

she exclaimed: â€œhow very odd of him!â€

â€œwhy so?â€ asked the son and heir. â€œwhy shouldnâ€™t my permission be
asked?â€

â€œwhat do you know about lucy or girls or anything? what ever did you
say?â€

â€œi said to cecil, â€˜take her or leave her; itâ€™s no business of mine!â€™â€

â€œwhat a helpful answer!â€ but her own answer, though more normal in its
wording, had been to the same effect.

â€œthe bother is this,â€ began freddy.

then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was. mrs.
honeychurch went back to the window.

â€œfreddy, you must come. there they still are!â€

â€œi donâ€™t see you ought to go peeping like that.â€

â€œpeeping like that! canâ€™t i look out of my own window?â€

but she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her
son, â€œstill page 322?â€ freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves. for a
brief space they were silent. close by, beyond the curtains, the gentle
murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.

â€œthe bother is this: i have put my foot in it with cecil most awfully.â€
 he gave a nervous gulp. â€œnot content with â€˜permissionâ€™, which i did
give--that is to say, i said, â€˜i donâ€™t mindâ€™--well, not content with
that, he wanted to know whether i wasnâ€™t off my head with joy. he
practically put it like this: was

y, when you never quite know what he
means. he said: â€˜mr. vyse is an ideal bachelor.â€™ i was very cute, i
asked him what he meant. he said â€˜oh, heâ€™s like me--better detached.â€™ i
couldnâ€™t make him say any more, but it set me thinking. since cecil has
come after lucy he hasnâ€™t been so pleasant, at least--i canâ€™t explain.â€

â€œyou never can, dear. but i can. you are jealous of cecil because he may
stop lucy knitting you silk ties.â€

the explanation seemed plausible, and freddy tried to accept it. but at
the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust. cecil praised one too
much for being athletic. was that it? cecil made one talk in oneâ€™s own
way. this tired one. was that it? and cecil was the kind of fellow who
would never wear another fellowâ€™s cap. unaware of his own profundity,
freddy checked himself. he must be jealous, or he would not dislike a
man for such foolish reasons.

â€œwill this do?â€ called his mother. â€œâ€˜dear mrs. vyse,--cecil has ju

â€œsuppose lucy marries cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the
country?â€

â€œdonâ€™t interrupt so foolishly. where was i? oh yes--â€˜young people must
decide for themselves. i know that lucy likes your son, because she
tells me everything, and she wrote to me from rome when he asked her
first.â€™ no, iâ€™ll cross that last bit out--it looks patronizing. iâ€™ll
stop at â€˜because she tells me everything.â€™ or shall i cross that out,
too?â€

â€œcross it out, too,â€ said freddy.

mrs. honeychurch left it in.

â€œthen the whole thing runs: â€˜dear mrs. vyse.--cecil has just asked my
permission about it, and i should be delighted if lucy wishes it, and
i have told lucy so. but lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days
young people must decide for themselves. i know that lucy likes your
son, because she tells me everything. but i do not know--â€™â€

the curtains parted.

was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled
those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a french cathedral.
well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he
remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows
as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision,
worshipped as asceticism. a gothic statue implies celibacy, just as
a greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what mr. beebe
meant. and freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same
when he failed to imagine cecil wearing another fellowâ€™s cap.

mrs. honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards
her young acquaintance.

â€œoh, cecil!â€ she exclaimed--â€œoh, cecil, do tell me!â€

â€œi promessi sposi,â€ said he.

they stared at him anxiously.

â€œshe has accepted me,â€ he said, and the sound of the thing in english
made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.

that was yellow with chemicals. they wished that they also knew italian,
for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with
little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones. we are obliged
to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in scriptural reminiscences.

â€œwelcome as one of the family!â€ said mrs. honeychurch, waving her hand
at the furniture. â€œthis is indeed a joyous day! i feel sure that you
will make our dear lucy happy.â€

hope so,â€ replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.

â€œwe mothers--â€ simpered mrs. honeychurch, and then realized that she
was affected, sentimental, bombastic--all the things she hated most.
why could she not be freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room;
looking very cross and almost handsome?

â€œi say, lucy!â€ called cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.

lucy rose from the seat. she moved across the lawn and smiled in at
them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis. then she saw
her brotherâ€™s face. her lips parted, and she took him in her arms. he
said, â€œsteady on!â€

â€œnot a kiss for me?â€ asked her mother.

lucy kissed her also.

â€œwould you take them into th

e garden and tell mrs. honeychurch all about
it?â€ cecil suggested. â€œand iâ€™d stop here and tell my mother.â€

â€œwe go with lucy?â€ said freddy, as if taking orders.

â€œyes, you go with lucy.â€

they passed into the sunlight. cecil watched them cross the terrace,
and descend out of sight by the steps. they would descend--he knew their
ways--past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed,
until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the
potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.

smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that
had led to such a

rable plains behind her. he walked home with her unashamed,
feeling not at all like a rejected suitor. the things that really
mattered were unshaken.

so now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she
had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply saying
that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy. his mother,
too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must write her a
long account.

glancing at his hand, in case any of freddyâ€™s chemicals had come off
on it, he moved to the writing table. there he saw â€œdear mrs. vyse,â€
 followed by many erasures. he recoiled without reading any more, and
after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on
his knee.

then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as
the first, and considered what might be done to make windy corner
drawing-room more distinctive. with that outlook it should have been a
successful room, but the trail of

writing-table. the table recalled mrs. honeychurchâ€™s
letter. he did not want to read that letter--his temptations never lay
in that direction; but he worried about it none the less. it was his
own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her
support in his third attempt to win lucy; he wanted to feel that others,
no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their
permission. mrs. honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials,
while as for freddy--â€œhe is only a boy,â€ he reflected. â€œi represent all
that he despises. why should he want me for a brother-in-law?â€

the honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize
that lucy was of another clay; and perhaps--he did not put it very
definitely--he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as
soon as possible.

â€œmr. beebe!â€ said the maid, and the new rector of summer street was
shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to lucyâ€™s

care a straw about, but somehow, iâ€™ve not been able to begin.â€

â€œyou are very fortunate,â€ said mr. beebe. â€œit is a wonderful
opportunity, the possession of leisure.â€

his voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to
answering naturally. he felt, as all who have regular occupation must
feel, that others should have it also.

â€œi am glad that you approve. i darenâ€™t face the healthy person--for
example, freddy honeychurch.â€

â€œoh, freddyâ€™s a good sort, isnâ€™t he?â€

â€œadmirable. the sort who has made england what she is.â€

cecil wondered at himself. why, on this day of all others, was he so
hopelessly contrary? he tried to get right by inquiring effusively after
mr. beebeâ€™s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.
then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his
enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.

â€œwhere are the others?â

â€œi know the faults of mary. she leaves the dust-pans standing on the
stairs.â€

â€œthe fault of euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the
suet sufficiently small.â€

they both laughed, and things began to go better.

â€œthe faults of freddy--â€ cecil continued.

â€œah, he has too many. no one but his mother can remember the faults of
freddy. try the faults of miss honeychurch; they are not innumerable.â€

â€œshe has none,â€ said the young man, with grave sincerity.

â€œi quite agree. at present she has none.â€

â€œat present?â€

his hat at the approaching trio. he did not omit to do so. â€œshe has
learnt through you,â€ and if his voice was still clerical, it was now
also sincere; â€œlet it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to
her.â€

â€œgrazie tante!â€ said cecil, who did not like parsons.

â€œhave you heard?â€ shouted mrs. honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping
garden. â€œoh, mr. beebe, have you heard the news?â€

freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. youth seldom
criticizes the accomplished fact.

â€œindeed i have!â€ he cried. he looked at lucy. in her presence he could
not act the parson any longer--at all events not without apology.
â€œmrs. honeychurch, iâ€™m going to do what i am always supposed to do, but
generally iâ€™m too shy. i want to invoke every kind of blessing on
them, grave and gay, great and small. i want them all their lives to be
supremely good and supremely happy

â€œyou only asked for it just in time,â€ the lady retorted. â€œhow dare you
be serious at windy corner?â€

he took his tone from her. there was no more heavy beneficence, no more
attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the scriptures. none of
them dared or was able to be serious any more.

an engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all
who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe. away from it, in the
solitude of their rooms, mr. beebe, and even freddy, might again be
critical. but in its presence and in the presence of each other they
were sincerely hilarious. it has a strange power, for it compels not
only the lips, but the very heart. the chief parallel to compare one
great thing with another--is the power over us of a temple of some alien
creed. standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel
sentimental. inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become
true believers, in case any true believer should be pre

so it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon
they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant
tea-party. if they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their
hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true. anne,
putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them
greatly. they could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave
them ere she kicked the drawing-room door. mr. beebe chirruped. freddy
was at his wittiest, referring to cecil as the â€œfiascoâ€--family honoured
pun on fiance. mrs. honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as
a mother-in-law. as for lucy and cecil, for whom the temple had been
built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest
worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.

â€œit matters supremely. sir harry is the essence of that garden-party.
oh, goodness, how cross i feel! how i do hope heâ€™ll get some vulgar
tenant in that villa--some woman so really vulgar that heâ€™ll notice
it. gentlefolks! ugh! with his bald head and retreating chin! but letâ€™s
forget him.â€

this lucy was glad enough to do. if cecil disliked sir harry otway and
mr. beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered
to her would escape? for instance, freddy. freddy was neither clever,
nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented cecil from saying, any
minute, â€œit would be wrong not to loathe freddyâ€? and what would she
reply? further than freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety
enough. she could only assure herself that cecil had known freddy some
time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps,
during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.

â€œwhich way shall we go?â€ she asked him.

â€œiâ€™d rather,â€ he said reproachfully, â€œthat you connected me with the open
air.â€

she said again, â€œoh, cecil, whatever do you mean?â€

as no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too
difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every
now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of
the trees. she had known the wood between summer street and windy corner
ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing freddy in it,
when freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to italy,
it had lost none of its charm.

presently they came to a little clearing among the pines--another tiny
green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.

she exclaimed, â€œthe sacred lake!â€

â€œwhy do you call it that?â€

â€œi canâ€™t remember why. i suppose it comes out of some book. itâ€™s only a
puddle now, but you see that stream going through it? well, a good deal

the pool becomes quite large and beautiful. then freddy used to bathe
there. he is very fond of it.â€

â€œand you?â€

he meant, â€œare you fond of it?â€ but she answered dreamily, â€œi bathed
here, too, till i was found out. then there was a row.â€

at another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of
prudishness within him. but now? with his momentary cult of the fresh
air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity. he looked at her as
she stood by the poolâ€™s edge. she was got up smart, as she phrased it,
and she re

was there.

â€œwell, if they are coming--no, minnie, not saturn.â€ saturn was a
tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn. when in motion his orb was
encircled by a ring. â€œif they are coming, sir harry will let them move
in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about
whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the
fair wear and tear one.--that doesnâ€™t count. i told you not saturn.â€

â€œsaturnâ€™s all right for bumble-puppy,â€ cried freddy, joining them.
â€œminnie, donâ€™t you listen to her.â€

â€œsaturn doesnâ€™t bounce.â€

â€œsaturn bounces enough.â€

â€œno, he doesnâ€™t.â€

â€œwell; he bounces better than the beautiful white devil.â€

â€œhush, dear,â€ said mrs. honeychurch.

â€œbut look at lucy--complaining of saturn, and all the timeâ€™s got the
beautiful white devil in her hand, ready to plug it in. thatâ€™s right,
minnie, go for her--get her over the shins with the racquet--get her
over the shins!â€

lucy fell, the beautiful white devil rolled from her hand.

mr. beebe picked it up, and said: â€œthe name of this ball is vittoria
corombona, please.â€ but his correction passed unheeded.

freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls
to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed minnie from a
well-mannered child into a howling wilderness. up in the house cecil
heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not
come down to impart it, in case he got hurt. he was not a coward and
bore necessary pain as well as any man. but he hated the physical
violence of the young. how right it was! sure enough it ended in a cry.

â€œemerson. iâ€™ll bet you anything you like.â€

never bothered over it at all.â€

then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky. mr. beebe,
whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that that was
the proper way to behave if any li

meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted mrs. honeychurch from
the contemplation of her own abilities.

â€œemerson, freddy? do you know what emersons they are?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know whether theyâ€™re any emersons,â€ retorted freddy, who was
democratic. like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally
attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there
are different kinds of emersons annoyed him beyond measure.

â€œi trust they are the right sort of person. all right, lucyâ€--she was
sitting up again--â€œi see you looking down your nose and thinking your
motherâ€™s a snob. but there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and itâ€™s
affectation to pretend there isnâ€™t.â€

she was gazing sideways. seated on a promontory herself, she could see
the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the weald.
the further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this lateral
view.

â€œi was merely going to remark, freddy, that i trusted they were no
relations of emerson the philosopher, a most trying man. pray, does that
satisfy you?â€

â€œoh, yes,â€ he grumbled. â€œand you will be satisfied, too, for theyâ€™re
friends of cecil; soâ€--elaborate irony--â€œyou and the other country
families will be able to call in perfect safety.â€

â€œcecil?â€ exclaimed lucy.

failed to come to cissie villa. poor little ladies! so shocked and so
pleased. it used to be one of miss catharineâ€™s great stories. â€˜my dear
sister loves flowers,â€™ it began. they found the whole room a mass of
blue--vases and jugs--and the story ends with â€˜so ungentlemanly and yet
so beautiful.â€™ it is all very difficult. yes, i always connect those
florentine emersons with violets.â€

â€œfiascoâ€™s done you this time,â€ remarked freddy, not seeing that his
sisterâ€™s face was very red. she could not recover herself. mr. beebe saw
it, and continued to divert the conversation.

â€œthese particular emersons consisted of a father and a son--the son
a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, i fancy, but very
immature--pessimism, et cetera. our special joy was the father--such a
sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.â€

in his normal state mr. beebe would never have repeated such gossip,

great victory for the comic muse. george meredithâ€™s right--the cause of
comedy and the cause of truth are really the same; and i, even i, have
found tenants for the distressful cissie villa. donâ€™t be angry! donâ€™t be
angry! youâ€™ll forgive me when you hear it all.â€

he looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled her
ridiculous forebodings at once.

â€œi have heard,â€ she said. â€œfreddy has told us. naughty cecil! i suppose
i must forgive you. just think of all the trouble i took for nothing!
certainly the miss alans are a little tiresome, and iâ€™d rather have nice
friends of yours. but you oughtnâ€™t to tease one so.â€

â€œfriends of mine?â€ he laughed. â€œbut, lucy, the whole joke is to come!

i met these desirable tenants? in the national gallery, when i was up to
see my mother last week.â

after her own interests, did not
disdain the assistance of mr. vyse. his idea of bringing the emersons to
windy corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the
negotiations without a hitch. sir harry otway signed the agreement,
met mr. emerson, who was duly disillusioned. the miss alans were
duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to lucy, whom they held
responsible for the failure. mr. beebe planned pleasant moments for the
new-comers, and told mrs. honeychurch that freddy must call on them as
soon as they arrived. indeed, so ample was the museâ€™s equipment that she
permitted mr. harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head,
to be forgotten, and to die.

lucy--to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows
because there are hills--lucy was at first plunged into despair, but
settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
now that she was engaged, the emersons would scarcely insult her and
were welcome

call would be welcome. puncturing
her tire near summer street, and it being mended while she sat very
woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a door
open opposite and the younger emerson man come out. he said his father
had just taken the house. he said he did not know that you lived in the
neighbourhood (?). he never suggested giving eleanor a cup of tea. dear
lucy, i am much worried, and i advise you to make a clean breast of his
past behaviour to your mother, freddy, and mr. vyse, who will forbid him
to enter the house, etc. that was a great misfortune, and i dare say you
have told them already. mr. vyse is so sensitive. i remember how i used
to get on his nerves at rome. i am very sorry about it all, and should
not feel easy unless i warned you.

chapter xii: twelfth chapter

it was a saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and
the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn. all
that was gracious triumphed. as the motorcars passed through summer
street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon
dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or
of the pines. mr. beebe, at leisure for lifeâ€™s amenities, leant over his
rectory gate. freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.

â€œsuppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.â€

â€œmâ€™m.â€

â€œthey might amuse you.â€

freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new
people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just
moved in.

â€œi suggested we should hinder them,â€ said mr. beebe. â€œthey are worth
it.â€ unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to
cissie villa. â€œhullo!â€ he cr

which much squalor was visible.

a grave voice replied, â€œhullo!â€

â€œiâ€™ve brought someone to see you.â€

â€œiâ€™ll be down in a minute.â€

the passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed
to carry up the stairs. mr. beebe edged round it with difficulty. the
sitting-room itself was blocked with books.

â€œare these people great readers?â€ freddy whispered. â€œare they that
sort?â€

â€œi fancy they know how to read--a rare accomplishment. what have they
got? byron. exactly. a shropshire lad. never heard of it. the way of
all flesh. never heard of it. gibbon. hullo! dear george reads german.
um--um--schopenhauer, nietzsche, and so we go on. well, i suppose your
generation knows its own business, honeychurch.â€

â€œmr. beebe, look at that,â€ said freddy in awestruck tones.

â€œhow very odd of him!â€

â€œsurely you agree?â€

but freddy was his motherâ€™s son and felt that one ought not to go on
spoiling the furniture.

â€œshe came back yesterday.â€

â€œi suppose she had a good time?â€

â€œyes, very,â€ said freddy, taking up a book. â€œshe and cecil are thicker

â€œwhat on earth are those people doing upstairs? emerson--we think weâ€™ll
come another time.â€

george ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.

â€œlet me introduce mr. honeychurch, a neighbour.â€

then freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth. perhaps he was shy,
perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that georgeâ€™s face wanted
washing. at all events he greeted him with, â€œhow dâ€™ye do? come and have
a bathe.â€

â€œoh, all right,â€ said george, impassive.

mr. beebe was highly entertained.

â€œâ€˜how dâ€™ye do? how dâ€™ye do? come and have a bathe,â€™â€ he chuckled.
â€œthatâ€™s the best conversational opening iâ€™ve ever heard. but iâ€™m afraid
it will only act between

â€œthe garden of eden,â€ pursued mr. emerson, still descending, â€œwhich you
place in the past, is really yet to come. we shall enter it when we no
longer despise our bodies.â€

mr. beebe disclaimed placing the garden of eden anywhere.

â€œin this--not in other things--we men are ahead. we despise the body
less than women do. but not until we are comrades shall we enter the
garden.â€

â€œi say, what about this bathe?â€ murmured freddy, appalled at the mass of
philosophy that was approaching him.

â€œi believed in a return to nature once. but how can we return to
nature when we have never been with her? to-day, i believe that we must
discover nature. after many conquests we shall attain simplicity. it is
our heritage.â€

â€œlet me introduce mr. honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at

â€œhow do you do? very glad to see you, and that you are taking george for

is a duty. i am sure that she will be happy, for we know mr. vyse, too.
he has been most kind. he met us by chance in the national gallery, and
arranged everything about this delightful house. though i hope i have
not vexed sir harry otway. i have met so few liberal landowners, and
i was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the
conservative attitude. ah, this wind! you do well to bathe. yours is a
glorious country, honeychurch!â€

â€œnot a bit!â€ mumbled freddy. â€œi must--that is to say, i have to--have
the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, i hope.â€

â€œcall, my lad? who taught us that drawing-room twaddle? call on your
grandmother! listen to the wind among the pines! yours is a glorious
country.â€

mr. beebe came to the rescue.

â€œmr. emerson, he will call, i shall call; you or your son will return
our calls before ten days have elapsed. i trust that you have realized
about the ten daysâ€™ interval. it does not coun

this afternoon.â€

â€œyes, go and bathe, george. why do you dawdle talking? bring them back
to tea. bring back some milk, cakes, honey. the change will do you good.
george has been working very hard at his office. i canâ€™t believe heâ€™s
well.â€

george bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of
one who has handled furniture.

â€œdo you really want this bathe?â€ freddy asked him. â€œit is only a pond,
donâ€™t you know. i dare say you are used to something better.â€

â€œyes--i have said â€˜yesâ€™ already.â€

mr. beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out
of the house and into the pine-woods. how glorious it was! for a little
time the voice of old mr. emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes
and philosophy. it ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the
bracken and the trees. mr. beebe, who could be silent, but who

t is fate that i am here,â€ persisted george. â€œbut you can call it
italy if it makes you less unhappy.â€

mr. beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject. but he was
infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub george.

â€œand so for this and for other reasons my â€˜history of coincidenceâ€™ is
still to write.â€

silence.

wishing to round off the episode, he added; â€œwe are all so glad that you

â€œhere we are!â€ called freddy.

â€œoh, good!â€ exclaimed mr. beebe, mopping his brow.

â€œin thereâ€™s the pond. i wish it was bigger,â€ he added apologetically.

they climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles. there lay the pond,
set in its little alp of green--only a pond, but large enough to contain
the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky. on account of the
rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a
beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central poo

no one knew, or seemed to care.

â€œthese abrupt changes of vegetation--this little spongeous tract of
water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or
brittle--heather, bracken, hurts, pines. very charming, very charming.â€

â€œmr. beebe, arenâ€™t you bathing?â€ called freddy, as he stripped himself.

mr. beebe thought he was not.

â€œwaterâ€™s wonderful!â€ cried freddy, prancing in.

â€œwaterâ€™s water,â€ murmured george. wetting his hair first--a sure sign of
apathy--he followed freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were
a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds. it was necessary to use his
muscles. it was necessary to keep clean. mr. beebe watched them, and
watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.

either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.

margin.

the bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the
question properly.

â€œhee-poof--iâ€™ve swallowed a pollywog, mr. beebe, waterâ€™s wonderful,
waterâ€™s simply ripping.â€

â€œwaterâ€™s not so bad,â€ said george, reappearing from his plunge, and
sputtering at the sun.

ees,
rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against
the blue. how glorious it was! the world of motor-cars and rural deans
receded inimitably. water, sky, evergreens, a wind--these things not
even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of
man?

â€œi may as well wash tooâ€; and soon his garments made a third little pile
on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.

it was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as freddy
said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad. the three gentlemen
rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in
gotterdammerung. but either because the rains had given a freshness or
because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the
gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit--for some
reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot italy and
botany and fate. they began to play. mr. beebe and freddy splashed each

feared they had offended him. then all the forces of youth burst out. he
smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them,
muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.

â€œrace you round it, then,â€ cried freddy, and they raced in the sunshine,
and george took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a
second time. then mr. beebe consented to run--a memorable sight.

they ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being
indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get
clean. and all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the
sward, proclaiming:

â€œno. we are what matters. without us shall no enterprise begin. to us
shall all flesh turn in th

â€œa try! a try!â€ yelled freddy, snatching up georgeâ€™s bundle and placing
it beside an imaginary goal-post.

â€œgoal!â€

â€œgoal!â€

â€œpass!â€

â€œtake care my watch!â€ cried mr. beebe.

clothes flew in all directions.

â€œtake care my hat! no, thatâ€™s enough, freddy. dress now. no, i say!â€

but the two young men were delirious. away they twinkled into the trees,
freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, george with a wide-awake
hat on his dripping hair.

â€œthatâ€™ll do!â€ shouted mr. beebe, remembering that after all he was in
his own parish. then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a rural
dean. â€œhi! steady on! i see people coming you fellows!â€

yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.

â€œhi! hi! ladies!â€

neither george nor freddy was truly refined. still, they did not hear

freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some
bracken. george whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the
path to the pond, still clad in mr. beebeâ€™s hat.

â€œgracious alive!â€ cried mrs. honeychurch. â€œwhoever were those
unfortunate people? oh, dears, look away! and poor mr. beebe, too!

sat concealed.

â€œoh, poor mr. beebe! was that his waistcoat we left in the path? cecil,

â€œno business of ours,â€ said cecil, glancing at lucy, who was all parasol
and evidently â€˜minded.â€™

â€œi fancy mr. beebe jumped back into the pond.â€

â€œthis way, please, mrs. honeychurch, this way.â€

they followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant
expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.

â€œwell, i canâ€™t help it,

â€œgood gracious me, dear; so itâ€™s you! what miserable management! why not
have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?â€

â€œlook here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellowâ€™s got to dry, and

for mr. beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface
garments of an intimate nature did float; while george, the world-weary
george, shouted to freddy that he had hooked a fish.

â€œand me, iâ€™ve swallowed one,â€ answered he of the bracken. â€œiâ€™ve
swallowed a pollywog. it wriggleth in my tummy. i shall die--emerson you

â€œhush, dears,â€ said mrs. honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain
shocked. â€œand do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first. all these

â€œi--i see what you mean, and certainly cecil oughtnâ€™t to. but he does

to herself, â€œoh, dear, what shall i do, what shall i do?â€ it seemed to
her that everyone else was behaving very badly. and she ought not to
have mentioned miss bartlettâ€™s letter. she must be more careful; her
mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was about.
oh, dear, what should she do?--and then freddy came bounding upstairs, and
joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.

â€œi say, those are topping people.â€

though nothing is perfect, lucy felt for the moment that her mother and

at the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one

â€œshe was a novelist,â€ said lucy craftily. the remark was a happy one,
for nothing roused mrs. honeychurch so much as literature in the hands
of females. she would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women
who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety
by print. her attitude was: â€œif books must be written, let them be
written by menâ€; and she developed it at great length, while cecil
yawned and freddy played at â€œthis year, next year, now, never,â€ with his
plum-stones, and lucy artfully fed the flames of her motherâ€™s wrath. but
soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the
darkness. there were too many ghosts about. the original ghost--that
touch of lips on her cheek--had surely been laid long ago; it could be
nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once. but it
had begotten a spectral family--mr. harris, miss bartlettâ€™s letter,

â€œi have been thinking, lucy, of that letter of charlotteâ€™s. how is she?â€

â€œi tore the thing up.â€

â€œdidnâ€™t she say how she was? how does she sound? cheerful?â€

â€œoh, yes i suppose so--no--not very cheerful, i suppose.â€

â€œthen, depend upon it, it is the boiler. i know myself how water preys
upon oneâ€™s mind. i would rather anything else--even a misfortune with
the meat.â€

cecil laid his hand over his eyes.

â€œso would i,â€ asserted freddy, backing his mother up--backing up the
spirit of her remark rather than the substance.

â€œand i have been thinking,â€ she added rather nervously, â€œsurely we could
squeeze charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday while
plumbers at tunbridge wells finish. i have not seen poor charlotte for
so long.â€

it was more than her nerves could stand. and she could not protest
violently after her motherâ€™s goodness to her upstairs.

â€œmother, no!â€ she pleaded. â€œitâ€™s

â€œminnie can sleep with you.â€

â€œi wonâ€™t have her.â€

â€œthen, if youâ€™re so selfish, mr. floyd must share a room with freddy.â€

laying his hand over his eyes.

â€œitâ€™s impossible,â€ repeated lucy. â€œi donâ€™t want to make difficulties,
but it really isnâ€™t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.â€

alas!

â€œthe truth is, dear, you donâ€™t like charlotte.â€

â€œno, i donâ€™t. and no more does cecil. she gets on our nerves. you

beautiful things; and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and

however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like
to grow old.â€

cecil crumbled his bread.

â€œi must say cousin charlotte was very kind to me that year i called on
my bike,â€ put in freddy. â€œshe thanked me for coming till i felt like
such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea
just right.â€

â€œi know, dear. she is kind to everyone, and yet lucy makes this
difficulty when we try to give her some little return.â€

but lucy hardened her heart. it was no good being kind to miss bartlett.

same again, and, on sunday week, something would even happen to windy
corner. how would she fight against ghosts? for a moment the visible
world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.

â€œi suppose miss bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,â€
 said cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the
admirable cooking.

â€œi didnâ€™t mean the egg was well boiled,â€ corrected freddy, â€œbecause in
point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact i donâ€™t
care for eggs. i only meant how jolly kind she seemed.â€

cecil frowned again. oh, these honeychurches! eggs, boilers, hydrangeas,
maids--of such were their lives compact. â€œmay me and lucy get down from
our chairs?â€ he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence. â€œwe donâ€™t want no

that was all. but, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell,
and she entertained an image that had physical beauty. in spite of the
clearest directions, miss bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
she was due at the south-eastern station at dorking, whither mrs.
honeychurch drove to meet her. she arrived at the london and brighton
station, and had to hire a cab up. no one was at home except freddy
and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for
a solid hour. cecil and lucy turned up at four oâ€™clock, and these, with
little minnie beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper
lawn for tea.

â€œi shall never forgive myself,â€ said miss bartlett, who kept on rising
from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
â€œi have upset everything. bursting in on young people! but i insist on

exclaimed in irritable tones: â€œjust what iâ€™ve been trying to convince
cousin charlotte of, lucy, for the last half hour.â€

â€œi do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,â€ said miss bartlett, and
looked at her frayed glove.

â€œall right, if youâ€™d really rather. five shillings, and i gave a bob to
the driver.â€

miss bartlett looked in her purse. only sovereigns and pennies. could
any one give her change? freddy had half a quid and his friend had four
half-crowns. miss bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: â€œbut who
am i to give the sovereign to?â€

â€œletâ€™s leave it all till mother comes back,â€ suggested lucy.

â€œno, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not
hampered with me. we all have our little foibles, and mine is the prompt
settling of accounts.â€

here freddyâ€™s friend, mr. floyd, made the one remark of his that need be

his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of chance, and turned
round.

but this did not do, either.

â€œplease--please--i know i am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me
wretched. i should practically be robbing the one who lost.â€

â€œfreddy owes me fifteen shillings,â€ interposed cecil. â€œso it will work
out right if you give the pound to me.â€

â€œbecause, donâ€™t you see, freddy paid your cab. give me the pound, and we
shall avoid this deplorable gambling.â€

â€œwhat i mean by subconscious is that emerson lost his head. i fell into
all those violets, and he was silly and surprised. i donâ€™t think we
ought to blame him very much. it makes such a difference when you see a
person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly. it really does;
it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesnâ€™t admire
me, or any of that nonsense, one straw. freddy rather likes him, and
has asked him up here on sunday, so you can judge for yourself. he has
improved; he doesnâ€™t always look as if heâ€™s going to burst into
tears. he is a clerk in the general managerâ€™s office at one of the big
railways--not a porter! and runs down to his father for week-ends. papa

on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to
place to save things; because the shadow always follows. choose a place
where you wonâ€™t do harm--yes, choose a place where you wonâ€™t do very
much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.â€

â€œoh, mr. emerson, i see youâ€™re clever!â€

â€œeh--?â€

â€œi see youâ€™re going to be clever. i hope you didnâ€™t go behaving like
that to poor freddy.â€

georgeâ€™s eyes laughed, and lucy suspected that he and her mother would
get on rather well.

â€œno, i didnâ€™t,â€ he said. â€œhe behaved that way to me. it is his
philosophy. only he starts life with it; and i have tried the note of
interrogation first.â€

â€œoh, i had no idea!â€ she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without
a word of greeting, she reopened the piano. cecil should have the

â€œour performer has changed her mind,â€ said miss bartlett, perhaps
implying, she will play the music to mr. emerson. lucy did not know
what to do nor even what she wanted to do. she played a few bars of the
flower maidensâ€™ song very badly and then she stopped.

â€œi vote tennis,â€ said freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.

â€œyes, so do i.â€ once more she closed the unfortunate piano. â€œi vote you
have a menâ€™s four.â€

â€œall right.â€

â€œnot for me, thank you,â€ said cecil. â€œi will not spoil the set.â€ he
never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make
up a fourth.

and would not sympathize with exaltation. he had been rather a nuisance
all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad
that he was obliged to read it aloud to others. he would stroll round
the precincts of the court and call out: â€œi say, listen to this, lucy.
three split infinitives.â€

â€œdreadful!â€ said lucy, and missed her stroke. when they had finished
their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and
really everyone must listen to it. freddy and mr. floyd were obliged to
hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.

â€œthe scene is laid in florence.â€

â€œwhat fun, cecil! read away. come, mr. emerson, sit down after all your
energy.â€ she had â€œforgivenâ€ george, as she put it, and she made a point
of being pleasant to him.

you tired?â€

â€œyes or no, please; yes or no.â€

â€œit is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.â€ george
emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.

â€œvery well,â€ said lucy, with an angry gesture. â€œno one will help me. i
will speak to him myself.â€ and immediately she realized that this was
what her cousin had intended all along.

â€œhullo, emerson!â€ called freddy from below. â€œfound the lost ball? good
man! want any tea?â€ and there was an irruption from the house on to the
terrace.

â€œoh, lucy, but that is brave of you! i admire you--â€

they had gathered round george, who beckoned, she felt, over the
rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning
to cumber her soul. her anger faded at the sight of him. ah! the
emersons were fine people in their way. she had to subdue a rush in her
blood before saying:

â€œhow can you ask such a ridiculous question?â€

â€œpoor lucy--â€ she stretched out her hand. â€œi seem to bring nothing
but misfortune wherever i go.â€ lucy nodded. she remembered their
last evening at florence--the packing, the candle, the shadow of miss
bartlettâ€™s toque on the door. she was not to be trapped by pathos a
second time. eluding her cousinâ€™s caress, she led the way downstairs.

â€œtry the jam,â€ freddy was saying. â€œthe jamâ€™s jolly good.â€

george, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the
dining-room. as she entered he stopped, and said:

â€œno--nothing to eat.â€

â€œyou go down to the others,â€ said lucy; â€œcharlotte and i will give mr.

â€œmr. emerson has had to go.â€

â€œwhat a nuisance! that spoils the four. i say, cecil, do play, do,

cecilâ€™s voice came: â€œmy dear freddy, i am no athlete. as you well
remarked this very morning, â€˜there are some chaps who are no good for
anything but booksâ€™; i plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not
inflict myself on you.â€

he was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her
engagement.

bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men. freddy and mr.

lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.

â€œi am very sorry about it,â€ she said; â€œi have carefully thought things
over. we are too different. i must ask you to release me, and try to

it was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her

it struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation
increased. she again desired a struggle, not a discussion. to bring on
the crisis, she said:

â€œthere are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them. things
must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day. if
you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to you--when
you wouldnâ€™t play tennis with freddy.â€

â€œi never do play tennis,â€ said cecil, painfully bewildered; â€œi never
could play. i donâ€™t understand a word you say.â€

â€œyou can play well enough to make up a four. i thought it abominably
selfish of you.â€

â€œno, i canâ€™t--well, never mind the tennis. why couldnâ€™t you--couldnâ€™t
you have warned me if you felt anything wrong? you talked of our wedding

i was fitted for your wife--for instance, in london; and are you fitted
to be my husband? i donâ€™t think so. you donâ€™t like freddy, nor my
mother. there was always a lot against our engagement, cecil, but all
our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good
mentioning it until--well, until all things came to a point. they have
to-day. i see clearly. i must speak. thatâ€™s all.â€

â€œi cannot think you were right,â€ said cecil gently. â€œi cannot tell
why, but though all that you say sounds true, i feel that you are not
treating me fairly. itâ€™s all too horrible.â€

he put down his glass and opened the window. from where she knelt,
jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into
it, as if it would tell him that â€œlittle more,â€ his long, thoughtful
face.

â€œdonâ€™t open the window; and youâ€™d better draw the curtain, too; freddy
or any one might be outside.â€ he obeyed. â€œi really think we had better
go to bed, if you donâ€™t mind. i shall only say things that will make me
unhappy afterwards. as you say it is all too horrible, and it is no good
talking.â€

more desirable. he looked at her, instead of through her, for the first
time since they were engaged. from a leonardo she had become a living

down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses
that supported the hill. on either side of it was a shallow ravine,
filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran
the highway into the weald.

whenever mr. beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble
dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, windy

a carriage was drawn up outside windy corner, and just as he caught
sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly
when it reached the main road. therefore it must be the horse, who
always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him. the
door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom mr. beebe recognized
as cecil and freddy. they were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw
a trunk beside the coachmanâ€™s legs. cecil, who wore a bowler, must be
going away, while freddy (a cap)--was seeing him to the station. they
walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the
carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.

they shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.

â€œhow delicate those sonatas are!â€ said mr. beebe, though at the bottom
of his heart, he thought them silly little things.

lucy passed into schumann.

â€œmiss honeychurch!â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œi met them on the hill. your brother told me.â€

â€œoh he did?â€ she sounded annoyed. mr. beebe felt hurt, for he had
thought that she would like him to be told.

â€œi neednâ€™t say that it will go no further.â€

â€œmother, charlotte, cecil, freddy, you,â€ said lucy, playing a note for
each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.

â€œif youâ€™ll let me say so, i am very glad, and i am certain that you have
done the right thing.â€

â€œso i hoped other people would think, but they donâ€™t seem to.â€

â€œi could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise.â€

â€œso does mother. mother minds dreadfully.â€

â€œi am very sorry for that,â€ said mr. beebe with feeling.

mrs. honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, b

ut not nearly as
much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute. it was really
a ruse of lucyâ€™s to justify her despondency--a ruse of which she was not
herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.

â€œand freddy minds.â€

â€œstill, freddy never hit it off with vyse much, did he? i gathered that
he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.â€

â€œboys are so odd.â€

minnie could be heard arguing with miss bartlett through the floor. tea
at the beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel. mr.
beebe saw that lucy--very properly--did not wish to discuss her action,
so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, â€œi have had an
absurd letter from miss alan. that was really what bro

ught me over. i
thought it might amuse you all.â€

â€œhow delightful!â€ said lucy, in a dull voice.

for the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter. after
a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with
â€œgoing abroad? when do they start?â€

â€œnext week, i gather.â€

â€œdid freddy say whether he was driving straight back?â€

â€œno, he didnâ€™t.â€

â€œbecause i do hope he wonâ€™t go gossiping.â€

so she did want to talk about her broken engagement. always complaisant,
he put the letter away. but she, at once exclaimed in a high voice, â€œoh,
do tell me more about the miss alans! how perfectly splendid of them to
go abroad!â€

â€œi want them to start from venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the
illyrian coast!â€

she laughed heartily. â€œoh, delightfu

she opened the discussion with: â€œwe had much better let the matter
drop.â€

â€œi wonder.â€

â€œit is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in
summer street. it would be death to gossip about mr. vyseâ€™s dismissal at
the present moment.â€

mr. beebe raised his eyebrows. death is a strong word--surely too
strong. there was no question of tragedy. he said: â€œof course, miss
honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she
chooses. freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.â€

â€œi know,â€ said miss bartlett civilly. â€œyet freddy ought not to have told
even you. one cannot be too careful.â€

â€œquite so.â€

â€œi do implore absolute secrecy. a chance word to a chattering friend,
and--â€

â€œexactly.â€ he was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated
importance that they attach to words. a rector lives in a web of petty
secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less

alone explains his action subsequently, and his influence on the
action of others. the compact that he made with miss bartlett in the
tavern, was to help not only lucy, but religion also.

they hurried home through a world of black and grey. he conversed on
indifferent topics: the emersonsâ€™ need of a housekeeper; servants;
italian servants; novels about italy; novels with a purpose; could
literature influence life? windy corner glimmered. in the garden, mrs.
honeychurch, now helped by freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her
flowers.

â€œit gets too dark,â€ she said hopelessly. â€œthis comes of putting off. we
might have known the weather would break up soon; and now lucy wants to
go to greece. i donâ€™t know what the worldâ€™s coming to.â€

â€œmrs. honeychurch,â€ he said, â€œgo to greece she must. come up to the
house and letâ€™s talk it over. do you, in the first place, mind her
breaking with vyse?â€

â€œmr. beebe, iâ€™m thankful--simply thankful.â€

â€œso a

â€œgood. now come up to the house.â€

they conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.

lucy would never have carried the greek scheme alone. it was expensive
and dramatic--both qualities that her mother loathed. nor would
charlotte have succeeded. the honours of the day rested with mr. beebe.
by his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman--for
a clergyman who was not a fool influenced mrs. honeychurch greatly--he
bent her to their purpose, â€œi donâ€™t see w

was so cross about greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.â€

rather a hard voice said: â€œthank you, mother; that doesnâ€™t matter a
bit.â€

â€œand you are right, too--greece will be all right; you can go if the
miss alans will have you.â€

â€œoh, splendid! oh, thank you!â€

mr. beebe followed. lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the
keys. she was glad, but he had expected greater gladness. her mother
bent over her. freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the
floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
oddly enough, the group was beautiful. mr. beebe, who loved the art of
the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the santa conversazione,
in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together
about noble things--a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and
therefore ignored by the art of to-day. why should lucy want either to
marry or to travel when she

  â€œtaste not when the wine-cup glistens,

she continued.

â€œhereâ€™s mr. beebe.â€

â€œmr. beebe knows my rude ways.â€

â€œitâ€™s a beautiful song and a wise one,â€ said he. â€œgo on.â€

â€œit isnâ€™t very good,â€ she said listlessly. â€œi forget why--harmony or
something.â€

â€œi suspected it was unscholarly. itâ€™s so beautiful.â€

â€œthe tuneâ€™s right enough,â€ said freddy, â€œbut the words are rotten. why
throw up the sponge?â€

â€œhow stupidly you talk!â€ said his sister. the santa conversazione was
broken up. after all, there was no reason that lucy should talk about
greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.

freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual
felicity of phrase, said: â€œthis has been a day and a half.â€

    â€œstop thine ear against the singer--â€

â€œwait a minute; she is finishing

â€œi love weather like this,â€ said freddy.

mr. beebe passed into it.

the two main facts were clear. she had behaved splendidly, and he had
helped her. he could not expect to master the details of so big a change
in a girlâ€™s life. if here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he
must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.

   â€œvacant heart and hand and eye--â€

perhaps the song stated â€œthe better partâ€ rather too strongly. he half
fancied that the soaring accompaniment--which he did not lose in the

the words that it adorned:

  â€œvacant heart and hand and eye

however, for the fourth time windy corner lay poised below him--now as a
beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.

the incidental advantage of being true. but she could not say it. she
disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that
king of terrors--light. ever since that last evening at florence she had
deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.

mrs. honeychurch, too, was silent. she was thinking, â€œmy daughter wonâ€™t
answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than
with freddy and me. any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she
can leave her home.â€ and as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken
long, she burst out with: â€œyouâ€™re tired of windy corner.â€

this was perfectly true. lucy had hoped to return to windy corner when
she escaped from cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no
longer. it might exist for freddy, who still lived and thought straight,
but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain. she did not

uldnâ€™t i laugh?â€ he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and
advancing his face to hers. â€œwhatâ€™s there to cry at? kiss me here.â€ he
indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.

he was a boy after all. when it came to the point, it was she who
remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she
who knew whose room this had been last year. it endeared him to her
strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.

â€œany letters?â€ he asked.

â€œjust a line from freddy.â€

â€œnow kiss me here; then here.â€

then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window,
opened it (as the english will), and leant out. there was the parapet,
there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills. the
cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might
be that very phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve
months ago. a passion of gratitude--all feelings grow to passions in the
south--came over the husband, and

certainty.

george told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away on
driving.

and the people who had not meant to help--the miss lavishes, the cecils,
the miss bartletts! ever prone to magnify fate, george counted up the
forces that had swept him into this contentment.

â€œanything good in freddyâ€™s letter?â€

â€œnot yet.â€

his own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the
honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past
hypocrisy; she had alienated windy corner, perhaps for ever.

â€œwhat does he say?â€

â€œsilly boy! he thinks heâ€™s being dignified. he knew we should go off in
the spring--he has known it for six months--that if mother wouldnâ€™t give
her consent we should take the thing into our own hands. they had fair
warning, and now
