[CHARACTER]
homer, much like emily, is an outsider, a stranger in town who becomes the subject of gossip. unlike emily, however, homer swoops into town brimming with charm, and he initially becomes the center of attention and the object of affection. some townspeople distrust him because he is both a northerner and day laborer, and his sunday outings with emily are in many ways scandalous, because the townspeople regard emily--despite her eccentricities--as being from a higher social class. homer's failure to properly court and marry emily prompts speculation and suspicion. he carouses with younger men at the elks club, and the narrator portrays him as either a homosexual or simply an eternal bachelor, dedicated to his single status and uninterested in marriage. homer says only that he is "not a marrying man."

as the foreman of a company that has arrived in town to pave the sidewalks, homer is an emblem of the north and the changes that grip the once insular and genteel world of the south. with his machinery, homer represents modernity and industrialization, the force of progress that is upending traditional values and provoking resistance and alarm among traditionalists. homer brings innovation to the rapidly changing world of this southern town, whose new leaders are themselves pursuing more "modern" ideas. the change that homer brings to emily's life, as her first real lover, is equally as profound and seals his grim fate as the victim of her plan to keep him permanently by her side.
