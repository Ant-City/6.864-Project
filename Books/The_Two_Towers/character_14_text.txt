ght of the pass, of a way in, and if we can find it now, then i suppose our agreement can be said to be over. you have done what you promised, and you're free: free to go back to food and rest, wherever you wish to go, except to servants of the enemy. and one day i may reward you, i or those that remember me.'
`no, no, not yet,' gollum whined. `o no! they can't find the way themselves, can they? o no indeed. there's the tunnel coming. sméagol must go on. no rest. no food. not yet.'

chapter 9

shelob's lair

it may indeed have been daytime now, as gollum said, but the hobbits could see little difference, unless, perhaps, the heavy sky above was less utterly black, more like a great roof of smoke; while instead of the darkness of deep night, which lingered still in cracks and holes, a grey blurring shadow shrouded the stony world about them. they passed on, gollum in front and the hobbits now side by side, up the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn and weathered rock, standing

f mountain-stone. darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as they approached, until it towered up high above them, shutting out the view of all that lay beyond. deep shadow lay before its feet. sam sniffed the air.
`ugh! that smell!' he said. `it's getting stronger and stronger.'
presently they were under the shadow, and there in the midst of it they saw the opening of a cave. `this is the way in,' said gollum softly. `this is the entrance to the tunnel.' he did not speak its name: torech ungol, shelob's lair. out of it came a stench, not the sickly odour of decay in the meads of morgul, but a foul reek, as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within.
`is this the only way, sméagol? ' said frodo.
'yes, yes,' he answered. 'yes, we must go this way now.'
'd'you mean to say you've been through this hole?' said sam. `phew! but perhaps you don't mind bad smells.'
gollum's eyes glinted. `he doesn't know what we minds, does he precious? no, he doesn't. but sméagol can bear things

heeding the shrillness of his voice, that released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and wild. 'the pass! run, run, and we'll be through-through before any one can stop us! '
sam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs; but glad as he was to be free, he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on glancing back at the dark arch of the tunnel, fearing to see eyes, or some shape beyond his imagining, spring out in pursuit. too little did he or his master know of the craft of shelob. she had many exits from her lair.
there agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider-form, even such as once of old had lived in the land of the elves in the west that is now under the sea, such as beren fought in the mountains of terror in doriath, and so came to lúthien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago. how shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the dark years few tales have come. but still she was there, who was there before sauron,

 and before the first stone of barad-dûr; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of elves and men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness. far and wide her lesser broods, bastards of the miserable mates, her own offspring, that she slew, spread from glen to glen, from the ephel dúath to the eastern hills, to dol guldur and the fastnesses of mirkwood. but none could rival her, shelob the great, last child of ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world.
already, years before, gollum had beheld her, sméagol who pried into all dark holes, and in past days he had bowed and worshipped her, and the darkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of his weariness beside him, cutting him off from light and from regret. and he had promised to bring her food. but her lust was not his lust. little she knew of or cared for towers, or rings, or anything devised by mind or hand, who on

so he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning, which he still hoped to hide from her, even when he had come to her again and had bowed low before her while his companions slept.
and as for sauron: he knew where she lurked. it pleased him that she should dwell there hungry but unabated in malice, a more sure watch upon that ancient path into his land than any other that his skill could have devised. and orcs, they were useful slaves, but he had them in plenty. if now and again shelob caught them to stay her appetite, she was welcome: he could spare them. and sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to his cat (his cat he calls her, but she owns him not) sauron would send her prisoners that he had no better uses for: he would have them driven to her hole, and report brought back to him of the play she made.
so they both lived, delighting in their own devices, and feared no assault, nor wrath, nor any end of their wickedness. never yet had any fly escaped from shelob's webs, and

d there was a claw.
as soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a horrible speed, now running on her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound. she was between sam and his master. either she did not see sam, or she avoided him for the moment as the bearer of the light` and fixed all her intent upon one prey, upon frodo, bereft of his phial, running heedless up the path, unaware yet of his peril. swiftly he ran, but shelob was swifter; in a few leaps she would have him.
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout. 'look out behind! ' he yelled. 'look out master! i'm' - but suddenly his cry was stifled.
a long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the neck, while something wrapped itself about his leg. taken off his guard he toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker.
`got him! ' hissed gollum in his ear. `at last, my precious, we've got him, yes, the nassty hobbit. we takes

this one. she'll get the other. o yes, shelob will get him, not sméagol: he promised; he won't hurt master at all. but he's got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!' he spat on sam's neck.
fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly peril, gave to sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he thought him. not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely. his hold on sam's mouth slipped, and sam ducked and

now the miserable creature was right under her, for the moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claws. her vast belly was above him with its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down. still his fury held for one more blow, and before she could sink upon him, smothering him and all his little impudence of courage, he slashed the bright elven-blade across her with desperate strength.
but shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her eyes. knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide, but ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth. the blade scored it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of men, not though elf or dwarf should forge the steel or the hand of beren or of túrin wield it. she yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up the great bag of her belly high above sam's head. poison fro

thed and bubbled from the wound. now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again. too soon. for sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping his own sword, with both hands he held the elven-blade point upwards, fending off that ghastly roof; and so shelob, with the driving force of her own cruel will, with strength greater than any warrior's hand, thrust herself upon a bitter spike. deep, deep it pricked, as sam was crushed slowly to the ground.
no such anguish had shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in all her long world of wickedness. not the doughtiest soldier of old gondor, nor the most savage orc entrapped, had ever thus endured her, or set blade to her beloved flesh. a shudder went through her. heaving up again, wrenching away from the pain, she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap.
sam had fallen to his knees by frodo's head, his senses reeling in the foul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the

`now come, you filth!' he cried. `you've hurt my master, you brute, and you'll pay for it. we're going on; but we'll settle with you first. come on, and taste it again!'
as if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion, the glass blazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand. it flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light. no such terror out of heaven had ever burned in shelob's face before. the beams of it entered into her wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain, and the dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye. she fell back beating the air with her forelegs, her sight blasted by inner lightnings, her mind in agony. then turning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and began to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind.
sam came on. he was reeling like a drunken man, but he came on. and shelob cowed at last, shrunken in d

efeat, jerked and quivered as she tried to hasten from him. she reached the hole, and squeezing down, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as sam hewed a last stroke at her dragging legs. then he fell to the ground.
shelob was gone; and whether she lay long in her lair, nursing her malice and her misery, and in slow years of darkness healed herself from within, rebuilding her clustered eyes, until with hunger like death she spun once more her dreadful snares in the glens of the mountains of shadow, this tale does not tell.
sam was left alone. wearily, as the evening of the nameless land fell upon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master.
'master, dear master,' he said, but frodo did not speak. as he had

 run forward, eager, rejoicing to be free, shelob with hideous speed had come behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. he lay now pale, and heard no voice. and did not move.
`master, dear master! ' said sam, and through a long silence waited. listening in vain.
then as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his head upon frodo's breast and to his mouth, but no stir of life could he find, nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart. often he chafed his master's hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all

n making up his mind, and now it was no good. how could he escape, or save himself, or save the ring? the ring. he was not aware of any thought or decision. he simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking the ring in his hand. the head of the orc-company appeared in the cleft right before him. then he put it on.
the world changed, and a single moment of time was filled with an hour of thought. at once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was dimmed, but otherwise than in shelob's lair. all things about him now were not dark but vague; while he himself was there in a grey hazy world, alone, like a small black solid rock and the ring, weighing down his left hand, was like an orb of hot gold. he did not feel invisible at all, but horribly and uniquely visible; and he knew that somewhere an eye was searching for him.
he heard the crack of stone, and the murmur of water far off in morgul vale; and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of shelob, groping, lost in som

is face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears. 'curse the filth! ' he said, and sprang after them into the darkness.
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if he had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog. his weariness was growing but his will hardened all the more. he thought he could see the light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch them up. orcs go fast in tunnels, and this tunnel they knew well.; for in spite of shelob they were forced to use it often as the swiftest way from the dead city over the mountains. in what far-off time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been made, where shelob had taken up her abode in ages past. they did not know: but many byways they had themselves delved about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters. tonight they did not intend to go far down. but were hastening to find a side-passage that led back to their

st of them were gleeful, delighted with what they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the fashion of their kind. sam heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. the captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing up the rear, debating as they went.
'can't you stop your rabble making such a racket, shagrat? ' grunted the one. `we don't want shelob on us.'
`go on, gorbag! yours are making more than half the noise,' said the other. `but let the lads play! no need to worry about shelob for a bit, i reckon. she's sat on a nail, it seems, and we shan't cry about that. didn't you see: a nasty mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers? if we've stopped it once, we've stopped it a hundred times. so let 'em laugh. and we've struck a bit of luck at last: got something that lugbúrz wants.'
'lugbúrz wants it, eh? what is it, d'you think?

 and he could then slip in.
`no, i don't know,' said gorbag's voice. `the messages go through quicker than anything could fly, as a rule. but i don't enquire how it's done. safest not to. grr! those nazgûl give me the creeps. and they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side. but he likes 'em; they're his favourites nowadays, so it's no use grumbling. i tell you, it's no game serving down in the city.'
`you should try being up here with shelob for company,' said shagrat.
'i'd like to try somewhere where there's none of 'em. but the war's on now, and when that's over things may be easier.'
`it's going well, they say.'
'they would.' grunted gorbag. `we'll see. but anyway, if it does go well, there should be a lot more room. what d'you say? - if we get a chance, you and me'll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few trusty lads, somewhere where there's good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses.'
'ah! ' said shagrat. `like o

 for a good while, i'm told.'
`the eye was busy elsewhere, i suppose,' said shagrat. `big things going on away west, they say.'
'i daresay,' growled gorbag. `but in the meantime enemies have got up the stairs. and what were you up to? you're supposed to keep watch, aren't you, special orders or no? what are you for?'
`that's enough! don't try and teach me my job. we were awake all right. we knew there were funny things going on.'
`very funny! '
`yes, very funny: lights and shouting and all. but shelob was on the go. my lads saw her and her sneak.'
`her sneak? what's that? '
`you must have seen him: little thin black fellow; like a spider himself, or perhaps more like a starved frog. he's been here before. came out of lugbúrz the first time, years ago, and we had word from high up to let him pass. he's been up the stairs once or twice since then, but we've left him alone: seems to have some understanding with her ladyship. i suppose he's no good to eat: she wouldn't worry about words from hi

gh up. but a fine guard you keep in the valley: he was up here a day before all this racket. early last night we saw him. anyway my lads reported that her ladyship was having some fun, and that seemed good enough for me, until the message came. i thought her sneak had brought her a toy. or that you'd perhaps sent her a present, a prisoner of war or something. i don't interfere when she's playing. nothing gets by shelob when she's on the hunt.'
'nothing, say you! didn't you use your eyes back there? i tell you i'm not easy in my mind. whatever came up the stairs, did get by. it cut her web and got clean out of the hole. that's something to think about! '
`ah well, but she got him in the end, didn't she? '
`got him? got who? this little fellow? but if he was the only one then she'd have had him off to her larder long before, and there he'd be now. and if lugbúrz wanted him, you'd have to go and get him. nice f

or you. but there was more than one.'
at this point sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear against the stone.
'who cut the cords she'd put round him, shagrat? same one as cut the web. didn't you see that? and who stuck a pin into her ladyship? same one, i reckon. and where is he? where is he, shagrat? '
shagrat made no reply.
`you may well put your thinking cap on, if you've got one. it's no laughing matter. no one, no one has ever stuck a pin in shelob before, as you should know well enough. there's no grief in that; but think-there's someone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel that ever walked since the bad old times, since the great siege. something has slipped.'
`and what is it then? ' growled shagrat.
`by all the signs, captain shagrat, i'd say there's a large warrior loose, elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: and he's loose in your bounds, too, and you've never spotted him. v

'stripped, eh? ' said gorbag. 'what, teeth, nails, hair, and all? '
`no, none of that. he's for lugbúrz, i tell you. he's wanted safe and whole.'
'you'll find that difficult,' laughed gorbag. 'he's nothing but carrion now. what lugbúrz will do with such stuff i can't guess. he might as well go in the pot.'
'you fool,' snarled shagrat. 'you've been talking very clever, but there's a lot you don't know, though most other folk do. you'll be for the pot or for shelob, if you don't take care. carrion! is that all you know of her ladyship? when she binds with cords, she's after meat. she doesn't eat dead meat, nor suck cold blood. this fellow isn't dead! '
sam reeled, clutching at the stone. he felt as if the whole dark world was turning upside down. so great was the shock that he almost swooned, but even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses, deep inside him he was aware of the comment: 'you fool, he isn't dead, and your heart knew it. don't trust your h

iven! now i've got to get back to him. somehow, somehow! '
he drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt, but it only gave out a dull sound. the sword, however, blazed so brightly now that he could see dimly in its light. to his surprise he noticed that the great block was shaped like a heavy door, and was less than twice his own height. above it was a dark blank space between the top and the low arch of the opening. it was probably only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of shelob, fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning. with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the top, scrambled up, and dropped; and then he ran madly, sword blazing in hand, round a bend and up a winding tunnel.
the news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort beyond thought of weariness. he could not see anything ahead. for this new passage twisted and turned constantly; but he thought he was catching the two orcs up: their voices were
