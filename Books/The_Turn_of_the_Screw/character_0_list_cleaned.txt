the [CHARACTER] - 
                the
protagonist of the novella, a twenty-year-old woman who has been
put in charge of educating and supervising flora and miles at the
country estate of bly. the [CHARACTER] has had a very sheltered upbringing
and little life experience, and her new job puts an immense responsibility
on her, since she has no one to supervise or help her. she is intelligent
as well as sensitive and emotionally volatile. over the course of
two short interviews with her employer, she fell in love with him,
but she has no opportunity to see him or communicate with him. she
is extremely protective of her charges and hopes to win her employer's
approval. she views herself as a zealous guardian, a heroine facing
dark forces. however, we never know for certain whether the ghosts
and visions the [CHARACTER] sees are real or only figments of her
imagination. no one else ever admits to seeing what she sees, and
her fears, at times, seem to border on insanity.
