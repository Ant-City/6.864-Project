bones and i have my swiss army knife if they hit me and if i 
kill them it will be self-defense and i won't go to prison. 
 
i am going to prove that i'm not stupid. next month i'm going to take my a level in maths and i'm going 
to  get  an  a  grade.  no  one  has  ever  taken  an  a  level  at  our  school  before,  and  the  headmistress,  mrs. 
gascoyne, didn't want me to take it at first. she said they didn't have the facilities to let us sit a levels. 
but father had an argument with mrs. gascoyne and he got really cross. mrs. gascoyne said they didn't 
want  to  treat  me  differently  from  everyone  else  in  the  school  because  then  everyone  would  want  to  be 
treated differently and it would set a precedent. and i could always do my a levels later, at 18. 
 
i  was  sitting  in  mrs.  gascoyne's  office  with  father  when  she  said  these  things.  and  father  said, 
"christopher is getting a crap enough deal already, don't you think, without you shitting on him from  a

eat height as well. jesus, this is the one thing he is really good at." 
 
then mrs. gascoyne said that she and father should talk about this at some later point on their own. but 
father asked her whether she wanted to say things she was embarrassed to say in front of me, and she said 
no, so he said, "say them now, then." 
 
and she said that if i sat an a level i would have to have a member of staff looking after me on my own 
in a separate room. and father said he would pay someone Â£50 to do it after school and he wasn't going 
to  take  no  for  an  answer.  and  she  said  she'd

, so i said he was being stupid, but siobhan said he 
wasn't. they were small plastic animals from the library that the staff use to make people tell stories. and 
joseph had eaten them. 
 
so  i  said  i  wasn't  going  to  go  into  the  toilets  because  there  was  poo  on  the  floor  and  it  made  me  feel 
uncomfortable to think about it, even though mr. ennison had come in and cleaned it up. and i wet my 
trousers and i had to put on some spare ones from the spare clothes locker in mrs. gascoyne's room. so 
siobhan said i could use the staff room toilets for two days, but only two days, and then i would have to 
use the children's toilets again. and we made this a deal. 
 
on  the  second,  third  and  fourth  days,  which  were  thursday,  friday  and  saturday,  nothing  interesting 
happened. 
 
on the fifth day, which was a sunday, it rained very hard. i like it when it rains hard. it sounds like white 
noise everywhere, which is like silence but not empty. 
 
i went upstairs and s

rs in a row and 4 yellow cars in a row, which meant it was both a good day and a black day, so 

the system didn't work anymore. but if i concentrated on counting the cars it stopped me from thinking 
about my a level and the pain in my chest. 
 
and in the afternoon mother took me to hampstead heath in a taxi and we sat on the top of a hill and 
looked at the planes coming into heathrow airport in the distance. and i had a red ice lolly from an ice 
cream van. and mother said she had rung mrs. gascoyne and told her that i was going to take my maths 
a level next year, so i threw  my red ice  lolly away and i screamed for a  long time and  the pain in  my 
chest hurt so much that it was hard to breathe and a man came up and asked if i was ok and mother said, 
"well, what does it look like to you?" and he went away. 
 
and  then  i  was  tired  from  screaming  and  mother  took  me  back  to  the  flat  in  another  taxi  and  the  next 
morning was saturday and she told mr. shears to go out a

d,  "so  you're  christopher's  mother."  and siobhan  said  that  she 
was glad to see me again and she asked if i was ok and i said i was tired. and mother explained that i 
was upset because i couldn't do my maths a level so i hadn't been eating properly or sleeping properly. 
 
and then, mother went away and i drew a picture of a bus using perspective so that i didn't think about 
the pain in my chest and it looked like this 

 

 

 
and after lunch siobhan said that she had spoken to mrs. gascoyne and she still had my a-level papers in 
3 sealed envelopes in her desk. 
 
so i asked if i could still do my a level. and siobhan said, "i think so. we're going to ring the reverend 
peters  this  afternoon  to  make  sure  he  can  still  come  in  and  be  your  invigilator.  and  mrs.  gascoyne  is 
going to write a letter to the examination board to say that you're going to take the exam after all. and 
hopefully they'll say that that's ok. but we can't know that for sure." then she stopped

e said people wouldn't want to read the answers to a maths question in a book, 
and she said i could put the answer in an appendix, which is an extra chapter at the end of a book which 
people can read if they want to. and that is what i have done. 
 
and then my chest didn't hurt so much and it was easier to breathe. but i still felt sick because i didn't 
know if i'd done well in the exam and because i didn't know if the examination board would allow  my 
exam paper to be considered after mrs. gascoyne had told them i wasn't going to take it. 
 
and  it's  best  if  you  know  a  good  thing  is  going  to  happen,  like  an  eclipse  or  getting  a  microscope  for 
christmas.  and  it's  bad  if  you  know  a  bad  thing  is  going  to  happen,  like  having  a  filling  or  going  to 
france. but i think it is worst if you don't know whether it is a good thing or a bad thing which is going to 
happen. 
 

and  father  came  round  to  the  house  that  night  and  i  was  sitting  on  the

o  spend  three  days  with  father  and  stay  in  his  house.  but  it  was  ok 
because  sandy  slept  on  my  bed  so  he  would  bark  if  anyone  came  into  the  room  during  the  night.  and 
father  made  a  vegetable  patch  in  the  garden  and  i  helped  him.  and  we  planted  carrots  and  peas  and 
spinach and i'm going to pick them and eat them when they're ready. 
 
and i went to a bookshop with mother and i bought a book called further maths for a level and father 
told mrs. gascoyne that i was going to take a-level further maths next year and she said "ok." 
 
and i am going to pass it and get an a grade. and in two years' time i am going to take a-level physics 
and get an a grade. 
 
and then, when i've done that, i am going to go to university in another town. and it doesn't have to be in 
london because i don't like london and there are universities in lots of places and not all of them are in 
big cities. and i can live in a flat with a garden and a proper toilet. and
