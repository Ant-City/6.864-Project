[CHARACTER] - 
                the
bumbling, greedy agents of the central station. they carry long
wooden staves with them everywhere, reminding marlow of traditional
religious travelers. they all want to be appointed to a station
so that they can trade for ivory and earn a commission, but none
of them actually takes any effective steps toward achieving this
goal. they are obsessed with keeping up a veneer of civilization
and proper conduct, and are motivated entirely by self-interest.
they hate the natives and treat them like animals, although in their greed
and ridiculousness they appear less than 
human themselves.
