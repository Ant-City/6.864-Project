ying serenity that comes from days of intense hunger. and yet, it
was a strangely satisfying experience for an invisible man to hear the silence
of sound. i had discovered unrecognized compulsions of my being -- even
though i could not answer "yes" to their promptings. i haven't smoked a
reefer since, however; not because they're illegal, but because to see around
corners is enough (that is not unusual when you are invisible). but to hear
around them is too much; it inhibits action. and despite brother jack and all
that sad, lost period of the brotherhood, i believe in nothing if not in action.
please, a definition: a hibernation is a covert preparation for a more
overt action.
besides, the drug destroys one's sense of time completely. if that
happened, i might forget to dodge some bright morning and some cluck
would run me down with an orange and yellow street car, or a bilious bus!
or i might forget to leave my hole when the moment for action presents
itself.
meanwhile i enjoy my life with the c

had committed myself to bring her some kind of surprise, and as i walked i
became mildly enthusiastic. it was, after all, a job that promised to exercise
my talent for public speaking, and if the pay was anything at all it would be
more than i had now. at least i could pay mary something of what i owed
her. and she might receive some satisfaction that her prediction had proved
correct.
i seemed to be haunted by cabbage fumes; the little luncheonette in
which i found the telephone was reeking.
brother jack didn't sound at all surprised upon receiving my call.
"i'd like some information about --"
"get here as quickly as you can, we're leaving shortly," he said,
giving me a lenox avenue address and hanging up before i could finish my
request.
i went out into the cold, annoyed both by his lack of surprise and
by the short, clipped manner in which he'd spoken, but i started out, taking
my own time. it wasn't far, and just as i reached the corner of lenox a car
pulled up and i saw several men inside,

jack among them, smiling.
"get in," he said. "we can talk where we're going. it's a party; you
might like it."
"but i'm not dressed," i said. "i'll call you tomorrow --"
"dressed?" he chuckled. "you're all right, get in."
i got in beside him and the driver, noticing that there were three
men in the back. then the car moved off.
no one spoke. brother jack seemed to sink immediately into deep
thought. the others looked out into the night. it was as though we were
mere chance passengers in a subway car. i felt uneasy, wondering where we
were going, but decided to say nothing. the car shot swiftly over the slush.
looking out at the passing night i wondered what kind of men they
were. certainly they didn't act as though they were heading for a very
sociable evening. i was hungry and i wouldn't get back in time for supper.
well, maybe it would be wor

a strange part of
the city. i could see the word chthonian on the storm awning stretched above
the walk as i got out with the others and went swiftly toward a lobby lighted
by dim bulbs set behind frosted glass, going past the uniformed doorman
with an uncanny sense of familiarity; feeling now, as we entered a soundproof
elevator and shot away at a mile a minute, that i had been through it all
before. then we were stopping with a gentle bounce and i was uncertain
whether we had gone up or down. brother jack guided me down the hall to
a door on which i saw a bronze door-knocker in the shape of a large-eyed
owl. now he hesitated a moment, his head thrust forward as though listening,
then his hand covered the owl from view, producing instead of the knock
which i expected, an icy peal of clear chimes. shortly the door swung partly
open, revealing a smartly dressed woman, whose hard, handsome face broke
into smiles.
"come in, brothers," she said, her exotic perfume filling the foyer.
i noticed a clip o

f blazing diamonds on her dress as i tried to stand
aside for the others, but brother jack pushed me ahead.
"excuse me," i said, but she held her ground, and i was pressing
tensely against her perfumed softness, seeing her smile as though there were
only she and i. then i was past, disturbed not so much by the close contact,
as by the sense that i had somehow been through it all before. i couldn't
decide if it were from watching some similar scene in the movies, from books
i'd read, or from some recurrent but deeply buried dream. whatsoever, it was
like entering a scene which, becaus

ome devious circumstance, i had
hitherto watched only from a distance. how could they have such an
expensive place, i wondered.
"put your things in the study," the woman said. "i'll go see about
drinks."
we entered a room lined with books and decorated with old musical
instruments: an irish harp, a hunter's horn, a clarinet and a wooden flute
were suspended by the neck from the wall on pink and blue ribbons. there
were a leather divan and a number of easy chairs.
"throw your coat on the divan," brother jack said.
i slid out of my overcoat and looked around. the dial of the radio
built into a section of the natural mahogany bookshelf was lighted, but i
couldn't hear any sound; and there was an ample desk on which rested silver
and crystal writing things, and, as one of the men came to stand gazing at
the bookcase, i was struck by the contrast between the richness of the room
and their rather poor clothing.
"now we'll go into the other room," brother jack said, taking me by
the arm.
we entered a lar

ll-dressed men and women were gathered in groups, some beside a grand
piano, the others lounging in the pale beige upholstery of the blond wood
chairs. here and there i saw several attractive young women but carefully
avoided giving them more than a glance. i felt extremely uncomfortable,
although after brief glances no one paid me any special attention. it was as
though they hadn't seen me, as though i were here, and yet not here. the
others were moving away to join the various groups now, and brother jack
took my arm.
"come, let's get a drink," he said, guiding me toward the end of the
room.
the woman who'd let us in was mixing drinks behind a handsome
free-form bar which was large enough to have graced a night club.
"how about a drink for us, emma?" brother jack said.
"well, now, i'll have to think about it," she said, tilting her severely
drawn head and smiling.
"don't think, act," he said. "we're very thirsty men. this young man
pushed history ahead twenty years today."
"oh," she said, her ey

loudly, as i remembered the best the
south had to offer. my face was warm, but i returned her glance as steadily
as i dared. it was not the harsh uninterested-in-you-as-a-human-being stare
that i'd known in the south, the kind that swept over a black man as though
he were a horse or an insect; it was something more, a direct,
what-type-of-mere-man-have-we-here kind of look that seemed to go beneath
my skin . . . somewhere in my leg a muscle twitched violently.
"emma, the bourbon! two bourbons," brother jack said.
"you know," she said, picking up a decanter, "i'm intrigued."
"naturally. always," he said. "intrigued and intriguing. but we're
dying of thirst."
"only of impatience," she said, pouring the drinks. "i mean you are.
tell me, where did you find this young hero of the people?"
"i didn't," brother jack said. "he simply arose out of a crowd. the
people always throw up their leaders, you know . . ."
"throw them up," she said. "nonsense, they chew them up and spit
them out. their leaders are ma

he looked at her steadily. i took the heavy crystal glass and raised it
to my lips, glad for an excuse to turn from her eyes. a haze of cigarette
smoke drifted through the room. i heard a series of rich arpeggios sound on
the piano behind me and turned to look, hearing the woman emma say not
quite softly enough, "but don't you think he should be a little blacker?"
"shhh, don't be a damn fool," brother jack said sharply. "we're not
interested in his looks but in his voice. and i suggest, emma, that you make
it your interest too . . ."
suddenly hot and breathless, i saw a window across the room and
went over and stood looking out. we were up very high; street lamps and
traffic cut patterns in the night below. so she doesn't think i'm black enough.
what does she want, a black-face comedian? who is she, anyway, brother
jack's wife, his girl friend? maybe she wants to see me sweat coal tar, ink,

really black i am, i thought, taking a big drink of the bourbon. it was
smooth, cold. i'd have to be careful with the stuff. anything might happen if
i had too much. with these people i'll have to be careful. always careful.
with all people i'll have to be careful . . .
"it's a pleasant view, isn't it?" a voice said, and i whirled to see a
tall dark man. "but now would you mind joining us in the library?" he said.
brother jack, the men who had come along in the car, and two
others whom i hadn't seen before were waiting.
"come in, brother," jack said. "business before pleasure is always a
good rule, whoever you are. some day the rule shall be business with
pleasure, for the joy of labor shall have been restored. sit down."
i took the chair directly before him, wondering what this speech was
all about.

gatherings with business, but with you it's ne

"why, i think it's fine," i said, trying to take in the full meaning of
his words. "i think it's excellent. but how?"
"by moving them to action just as you did this morning. . . brothers,
i was there," he said to the others, "and he was magnificent. with a few
words he set off an effective demonstration against evictions!"
"i was present too," another said. "it was amazing."
"tell us something of your background," brother jack said, his voice
and manner demanding truthful answers. and i explained briefly that i had
come up looking for work to pay my way through college and had failed.
"do you still plan to return?"
"not now," i said. "i'm all done with that."
"it's just as well," brother jack said. "you have little to learn down
there. however, college training is not a bad thing -- although you'll have to
forget most of it. did you study economics?"
"some."
"sociology?"
"yes."
"well, let me advise you to forget it.

"then i don't understand you." was i drunk? i looked at him; he
seemed sober.
"what do you think of the idea? or better still, what do you think of
booker t. washington?"
"why, naturally, i think he was an important figure. at least most
people say so."
"but?"
"well," i was at a loss for words. he was going too fast again. the
whole idea was insane and yet the others were looking at me calmly; one of
them was lighting up an underslung pipe. the match sputtered, caught fire.
"what is it?" brother jack insisted.
"well, i guess i don't think he was as great as the founder."
"oh? and why not?"
"well, in the first place, the founder came before him and did
practically everything booker t. washington did and a lot more. and more
people believed in him. you hear a lot of arguments about booker t.
washington, but few would argue about the founder . . ."

well known, or at least i'd never seen their faces in the newspapers.
"during these times of indecision when all the old answers are
proven false, the people look back to the dead to give them a clue," he went
on. "they call first upon one and then upon another of those who have acted
in the past."
"if you please, brother," the man with the pipe interrupted, "i think
you should speak more concretely."
"please don't interrupt," brother jack said icily.
"i wish only to point out that a scientific terminology exists," the
man said, emphasizing his words with his pipe. "after all, we call ourselves
scientists here. let us speak as scientists."
"in due time," brother jack said. "in due time . . . you see,
brother," he said, turning to me, "the trouble is that there is little the dead
can do; otherwise they wouldn't be the dead. no! but on the other hand, it
would be a great mistake to assume that the dead are absolutely powerless.

there was silence. i could hear the wet cracking of the pipe.
"perhaps we should allow the brother to express himself as to how
he feels about all this," the man with the pipe said.
"well, brother?" brother jack said.
i looked into their waiting faces.
"it's all so new to me that i don't know exactly what i do think," i
said. "do you really think you have the right man?"
"you mustn't let that worry you," brother jack said. "you will rise to
the task; it is only necessary that you work hard and follow instructions."

suddenly to his feet.
"what is it?" someone asked.
"nothing, excuse me," he said, rolling to the door and beckoning. in
a moment i saw the woman appear.
"emma, the slip of paper i gave you. give it to the new brother," he
said as she stepped inside and closed the door.
"oh, so it's you," she said with a meaningful smile.
i watched her reach into the bosom of her taffeta hostess gown and
remove a white envelope.
"this is your new identity," brother jack said. "open it."
inside i found a name written on a slip of paper.
"that is your new name," brother jack said. "start thinking of
yourself by that name from this moment. get it down so that even if you are
called in the middle of the night you will respond. very soon you shall be
known by it all over the country. you are to answer to no other,
understand?"
"i'll try," i said.
"don't forget his living quarters," the tall man said.
"no," brother jack said with a frown. "emma, please, some funds."

sixty a week! there was nothing i could say. the woman had
crossed the room to the desk and returned with the money, placing it in my
hand.
"you'd better put it away," she said expansively.
"well, brothers, i believe that's all," he said. "emma, how about a
drink?"
"of course, of course," she said, going to a cabinet and removing a
decanter and a set of glasses in which she poured about an inch of clear
liquid.
"here you are, brothers," she said.

my glass.
"to history," we all said.
the stuff burned, causing me to lower my head to hide the tears that
popped from my eyes.
"aaaah!" someone said with deep satisfaction.
"come along," emma said. "let's join the others."
"now for some pleasure," brother jack said. "and remember your
new identity."
i wanted to think but they gave me no time. i was swept into the

grasped me warmly by the hand.
"what is your opinion of the state of women's rights, brother?" i was
asked by a plain woman in a large black velvet tarn. but before i could open
my mouth, brother jack had pushed me along to a group of men, one of
whom seemed to know all about the eviction. nearby, a group around the
piano were singing folk songs with more volume than melody. we moved
from group to group, brother jack very authoritative, the others always
respectful. he must be a powerful man, i thought, not a clown at all. but to

"yes, uh . . . brother," i said.

work songs? like this: ah went to atlanta -- nevah been there befo'," he
sang, his arms held out from his body like a penguin's wings, glass in one
hand, cigar in the other. "white man sleep in a feather bed, nigguh sleep on

"the brother does not sing!" brother jack roared staccato.
"nonsense, all colored people sing."
"this is an outrageous example of unconscious racial chauvinism!"
jack said.
"nonsense, i like their singing," the broad man said doggedly.
"the brother does not sing!" brother jack cried, his face turning a
deep purple.
the broad man regarded him stubbornly. "why don't you let him say
whether he can sing or not . . . ? come on, brother, git hot! go down,

snapping his finge

shouted belligerently.
brother jack looked as if he would choke; he raised his hand,
signaling. i saw two men shoot from across the room and lead the short man
roughly away. brother jack followed them as they disappeared beyond the
door, leaving an enormous silence.
for a moment i stood there, my eyes riveted upon the door, then i
turned, the glass hot in my hand, my face feeling as though it would explode.
why was everyone staring at me as though i were responsible? why the hell
were they staring at me? suddenly i yelled, "what's the matter with you?

man's voice staggered drunkenly to us, "st. louis mammi

turning to the group nearest me. "he's abso-lutely drunk . . . off music!"
"yes. sure," a man said nervously. "ha, ha . . ."
"three sheets in the wind," i laughed, getting my breath now, and
discovering that the silent tension of the others was ebbing into a ripple of
laughter that sounded throughout the room, growing swiftly to a roar, a laugh
of all dimensions, intensities and intonations. everyone was joining in. the
room fairly bounced.
"and did you see brother jack's face," a man shouted, shaking his
head.
"it was murder!"
"go down moses!"
"i tell you it was murder!"
across the room they were pounding someone on the back to keep
him from choking. handkerchiefs appeared, there was much honking of noses,
wiping of eyes. a glass crashed to the floor, a chair was overturned. i fought
against the painful laughter, and as i calmed i saw them looking at me with
a sort of embarrassed gratitude. it was sobering and yet they seemed bent
upon pretending that nothing

. a black broad-brimmed one;
perhaps a homburg . . . humbug? i laughed. well, i could leave packing for
tomorrow -- i had very little, which was perhaps all to the good. i would
travel light, far and fast. they were fast people, all right. what a vast
difference between mary and those for whom i was leaving her. and why
should it be this way, that the very job which might make it possible for me
to do some of the things which she expected of me required that i leave her?
what kind of room would brother jack select for me and why wasn't i left
to select my own? it didn't seem right that in order to become a harlem
leader i should live elsewhere. yet nothing seemed right and i would have to
rely upon their judgment. they seemed expert in such matters.
but how far could i trust them, and in what way were they different
from the trustees? whatever, i was committed; i'd learn in the process of
working with them, i thought, remembering the money. the bills were crisp
and fresh and i tried to imagine mar

money could never repay
her generosity. she would never understand my wanting to move so quickly
after getting a job. and if i had any kind of success at all, it would seem the
height of ingratitude. how would i face her? she had asked for nothing in
return. or hardly anything, except that i make something of myself that she
called a "race leader." i shivered in the cold. telling her that i was moving
would be a hard proposition. i didn't like to think of it, but one couldn't be
sentimental. as brother jack had said, history makes harsh demands of us
all. but they were demands that had to be met if men were to be the
masters and not the victims of their times. did i believe that? perhaps i had
already begun to pay. besides, i might as well admit right now, i thought,
that there are many things about people like mary that i dislike. for one
thing, they seldom know where their personalities end and yours begins; they
usually think in terms of "we" while i have always tended to think in terms
of "me"

 -- and that has caused some friction, even with my own family.
brother jack and the others talked in terms of "we," but it was a different,
bigger "we."
well, i had a new name and new problems. i had best leave the old
behind. perhaps it would be best not to see mary at all, just place the money
in an envelope and leave it on the kitchen table where she'd be sure to find
it. it would be better that way, i thought drowsily; then there'd be no need
to stand before her and stumble over emotions and words that were at best
all snarled up and undifferentiated . . . one thin

 seemed to leap
from my ears to my side and i saw gray marks appearing where the old skin
was flaking away beneath my digging nails. and as i watched i saw thin lines
of blood well up in the scratches, bringing pain and joining time and place
again, and i thought, the room has lost its heat on my last day at mary's,
and suddenly i was sick at heart.
the clock, its alarm lost in the larger sound, said seven-thirty, and i
got out of bed. i'd have to hurry. there was shopping to do before i called
brother jack for my instructions and i had to get the money to mary -- why
didn't they stop that noise? i reached for my shoes, flinching as the knocking
seemed to sound an inch above my head. why don't they stop, i thought.
and why do i feel so let down? the bourbon? my nerves going bad?
suddenly i was across the room in a bound, pounding the pipe
furiously with my shoe heel.
"stop it, you ignorant fool!"
my head was splitting. beside myself, i struck pieces of silver from

ry carried on the front page of a tabloid, and i
read it eagerly. i was referred to only as an unknown "rabble rouser" who
had disappeared in the excitement, but that it referred to me was
unmistakable. it had lasted for two hours, the crowd refusing to vacate the
premises. i entered the clothing store with a new sense of self-importance.
i selected a more expensive suit than i'd intended, and while it was
being altered i picked up a hat, shorts, shoes, underwear and socks, then
hurried to call brother jack, who snapped his orders like a general. i was to
go to a number on the upper east side where i'd find a room, and i was to
read over some of the brotherhood's literature which had been left there for
me, with the idea of my making a speech at a harlem rally to be held that
evening.
the address was that of an undistinguished building in a mixed
spanish-irish neighborhood, and there were boys throwing snowballs across
the street when i rang the super's bell. the door was opened by a small

the apartment was clean and neat and i liked it -- especially the
bathroom with its tub and shower. and as quickly as i could i drew a bath
and soaked myself. then feeling clean and exhilarated i went out to puzzle
over the brotherhood books and pamphlets. my brief case with the broken
image lay on the table. i would get rid of the package later; right now i had
to think about tonight's rally.
chapter 16
at seven-thirty brother jack and some of the others picked me up
and we shot up to harlem in a taxi. as before, no one spoke a word. there
was only the sound made by a man in the corner who drew noisily on a
pipeful of rum-flavored tobacco, causing it to glow on and off, a red disk in
the dark. i rode with mounting nervousness; the taxi seemed unnaturally
warm. we got out in a side street and went down a narrow alley in the dark
to the rear of the huge, barn-like building. other members had already
arrived.
"ah, here we ar

e," brother jack said, leading the way through a dark
rear door to a dressing room lighted by naked, low-hanging bulbs -- a small
room with wooden benches and a row of steel lockers with a network of
names scratched on the doors. it had a football-locker smell of ancient sweat,
iodine, blood and rubbing alcohol, and i felt a welling up of memories.
"we remain here until the building fills," brother jack said. "then we
make our appearance -- just at the height of their impatience." he gave me a
grin. "meanwhile, you think about what you'll say. did you look over the
material?"
"all day," i said.
"good. i suggest, however, that you listen carefully to the rest of us.
we'll all precede you so that you can get pointers for your remarks. you'll be
last."
i nodded, seeing him take two of the other men by the arm and
retreat to a corner. i was alone, the others were studying their notes, talking.

of saddles and leggings shining. three white men and three black horses.
then a car passed and they showed in full relief, their shadows flying like
dreams across the sparkle of snow and darkness. and, as i turned to leave,
one of the horses violently tossed its head and i saw the gauntleted fist
yanked down. then there was a wild neigh and the horse plunged off in the
dark, the crisp, frantic clanking of metal and the stomping of hooves followed
me to the door. perhaps this was something for brother jack to know.
but inside they were still in a huddle, and i went back and sat on
the bench.
i watched them, feeling very young and inexperienced and yet
strangely old, with an oldness that watched and waited quietly within me.
outside, the audience had begun to drone; a distant, churning sound that
brought back some of the terror of the eviction. my mind flowed. there was
a child standing in rompers outside a chicken-wire fence, looking in upon a
huge black-and-white dog, log-chained to an apple tre

with heat, he seemed to grin back at me like a fat good-natured man, the
saliva roping silvery from his jowls. and as the voices of the crowd churned
and mounted and became an impatient splatter of hand claps, i thought of
master's low hoarse growl. he had barked the same note when angry or
when being brought his dinner, when lazily snapping flies, or when tearing an
intruder to shreds. i liked, but didn't trust old master; i wanted to please,
but did not trust the crowd. then i looked at brother jack and grinned: that
was it; in some ways, he was like a toy bull terrier.
but now the roar and clapping of hands became a song and i saw
brother jack break off and bounce to the door. "okay, brothers," he said,
"that's our signal."
we went in a bunch, out of the dressing room and down a dim
passage aroar with the distant sound. then it was brighter and i could see a
spotlight blazing the smoky haze. we moved silently, brother jack following
two very black negroes and two white men who led the pro

imagine that, i thought, they make the old song sound new. at first
i was as remote as though i stood in the highest balcony looking on. then i
walked flush into the vibrations of the voices and felt an electric tingling
along my spine. we marched toward a flag-draped platform set near the front
of the arena, moving through an aisle left between rows of people in folding
chairs, then onto the platform past a number of women who stood when we
came on. with a nod brother jack indicated our chairs and we faced the
applause standing.
below and above us was the audience, row after row of faces, the
arena a bowl-shaped aggregation of humanity. then i saw the policemen and
was disturbed. what if they recognized me? they were all along the wall. i
touched the arm of the man ahead, seeing him turn, his mouth halting in a
verse of the song.
"why all the police?" i said, leaning forward on the back of his
chair.
"cops? don't worry. tonight they're ordered to protect us. this

meeting is of great political consequence!" he said, turning away.
who ordered them to protect us? i thought -- but now the song was
ending and the building rang with applause, yells, until the chant burst from
the rear and spread:
no more dispossessing of the dispossessed!
no more dispossessing of the dispossessed!
the audience seemed to have become one, its breathing and
articulation synchronized. i looked at brother jack. he stood up front beside
a microphone, his feet planted solidly on the dirty canvas-covered platform,
looking from side to side; his posture dignified and benign, like a bemused
father listening to the performance of his adoring children. i saw his hand go
up in a salute, and the audience thundered. and i seemed to move in close,
like the lens of a camera, focusing into the scene and feeling the heat and
excitement and the pounding of voice and applause against my diaphragm,
my eyes flying fro

flared between
speeches, chants exploded as spontaneously as shouts at a southern revival.
and i was somehow attuned to it all, could feel it physically. sitting with my
feet on the soiled canvas i felt as though i had wandered into the percussion
section of a symphony orchestra. it worked on me so thoroughly that i soon
gave up trying to memorize phrases and simply allowed the excitement to
carry me along.
someone pulled on my coat sleeve -- my turn had come. i went
toward the microphone where brother jack himself waited, entering the spot
of light that surrounded me like a seamless cage of stainless steel. i halted.
the light was so strong that i could no longer see the audience, the bowl of
human faces. it was as though a semi-transparent curtain had dropped
between us, but through which they could see me -- for they were applauding
-- without themselves being seen. i felt the hard, mechanical isolation of the
hospital machine and i didn't like it. i stood, barely hearing brother jack's

common about us. i think they're guilty of a gross mis-statement of fact --

"another strike," the voice called in the thunder, and i paused
holding up my hand to halt the noise.
"yes, we're the uncommon people -- and i'll tell you why. they call
us dumb and they treat us dumb. and what do they do with dumb ones?
think about it, look around! they've got a slogan and a policy. they've got
what brother jack would call a 'theory and a practice.' it's 'never give a
sucker an even break!' it's dispossess him! evict him! use his empty head for
a spittoon and his back for a door mat! it's break him! deprive him of his
wages! it's use his protest as a sounding brass to frighten him into silence,
it's beat his ideas and his hopes and homely aspirations, into a tinkling

t there, and i couldn't afford to lose them. yet i
suddenly felt naked, sensing that the words were returning and that
something was about to be said that i shouldn't reveal.
"look at me!" the words ripped from my solar plexus. "i haven't
lived here long. times are hard, i've known despair. i'm from the south, and
since coming here i've known eviction. i'd come to distrust the world . . .
but look at me now, something strange is happening. i'm here before you. i
must confess . . ."
and suddenly brother jack was beside me, pretending to adjust the
microphone. "careful now," he whispered. "don't end your usefulness before
you've begun."
"i'm all right," i said, leaning toward the mike.
"may i confess?" i shouted. "you are my friends. we share a
common disinheritance, and it's said that confession is good for the soul.
have i your permission?"
"your batting .500, brother," the voice called.
there was a stir behind me. i waited until it was quiet and hurried
on.
"silence is consent," i said, "so i'll

blurred figures bumped about me. i stumbled as in a game of
blindman's buff. my hands were shaken, my back pounded. my face was
sprayed with the saliva of enthusiasm, and i decided that the next time i
stood in the spotlight it would be wise to wear dark glasses.
it was a deafening demonstration. we left them cheering, knocking
over chairs, stomping the floor. brother jack guided me off the platform. "it's
time we left," he shouted. "things have truly begun to move. all that energy
must be organized!"
he guided me through the shouting crowd, hands continuing to touch
me as i stumbled along. then we entered the dark passage and when we
reached the end the spots faded from my eyes and i began to see again.
brother jack paused at the door.
"listen to them," he said. "just waiting to be told what to do!" and
i could still hear the applause booming behind us. then sev

eral of the others
broke off their conversation and faced us, as the applause muffled down
behind the closing door.
"well, what do you think?" brother jack said enthusiastically. "how's
that for a starter?"
there was a tense silence. i looked from face to face, black and
white, feeling swift panic. they were grim.
"well?" brother jack said, his voice suddenly hard.
i could hear the creaking of someone's shoes.
"well?" he repeated.
then the man with the pipe spoke up, a swift charge of tension
building with his words.
"it was a most unsatisfactory beginning," he said quietly, punctuating
the "unsatisfactory" with a stab of his pipe. he was looking straight at me
and i was puzzled. i looked at the others. their faces were noncommittal,
stolid.
"unsatisfactory!" brother jack exploded. "and what alleged process of
thought led to

 that brilliant pronouncement?"
"this is no time for cheap sarcasm, brother," the brother with the
pipe said.
"sarcasm? you made the sarcasm. no, it isn't a time for sarcasms
nor for imbecilities. nor for plain damn-fooleries! this is a key moment in
the struggle, things have just begun to move -- and suddenly you are
unhappy. you are afraid of success? what's wrong? isn't this just what we've
been working for?"
"again, ask yourself. you are the great leader. look into your crystal
ball."
brother jack swore.
"brothers!" someone said.
brother jack swore and swung to another brother. "you," he said to
the husky man. "have you the courage to tell me what's going on here? have
we become a street-corner gang?"
silence. someone shuffled his feet. the man with the pipe was
looking now at me.
"did i do something wrong?" i said.
"the worst you could have done," he said coldly.
stunned, i looked at him wordlessly.
"never mind," brother jack said, suddenly calm. "just what is the
problem, brother? let'

s have it out right here. just what is your complaint?"
"not a complaint, an opinion. if we are still allowed to express our
opinions," the brother with the pipe said.
"your opinion, then," brother jack said.
"in my opinion the speech was wild, hysterical, politically
irresponsible and dangerous," he snapped. "and worse than that, it was
incorrect!" he pronounced "incorrect" as though the term described the most
heinous crime imaginable, and i stared at him open-mouthed, feeling a vague
guilt.
"soooo," brother jack said, looking from face to face, "there's been a
caucus and decisions have been made. did you take minutes, brother
chairman? have you recorded your wise disputations?"
"there was n

the pipe said.
"no meeting, but just the same there has been a caucus and
decisions have been reached even before the event is finished."
"but, brother," someone tried to intervene.
"a most brilliant, operation," brother jack went on, smiling now. "a
consummate example of skilled theoretical nijinskys leaping ahead of history.
but come down. brothers, come down or you'll land on your dialectics; the
stage of history hasn't built that far. the month after next, perhaps, but not
yet. and what do you think, brother wrestrum?" he asked, pointing to a big
fellow of the shape and size of supercargo.
"i think the brother's speech was backward and reactionary!" he said.
i wanted to answer but could not. no wonder his voice

so mixed when he congratulated me. i could only stare into the broad face
with its hate-burning eyes.
"and you," brother jack said.
"i liked the speech," the man said, "i thought it was quite effective."
"and you?" brother jack said to the next man.
"i am of the opinion that it was a mistake."
"and just why?"
"because we must strive to reach the people through their intelligence
. . ."
"exactly," the brother with the pipe said. "it was the antithesis of the
scientific approach. ours is a reasonable point of view. we are champions of
a scientific approach to society, and such a speech as we've identified
ourselves with tonight destroys everything that has been said before. the
audience isn't thinking, it's yelling its

"sure, it's acting like a mob," the big black brother said.
brother jack laughed. "and this mob," he said, "is it a mob against
us, or is it a mob for us -- how do our muscle-bound scientists answer that?"
but before they could answer he continued, "perhaps you're right,
perhaps it is a mob; but if it is, then it seems to be a mob that's simply
boiling over to come along with us. and i shouldn't have to tell you
theoreticians that science bases its judgments upon experiment! you're
jumping to conclusions before the experiment has run its course. in fact,

bristling, but no one answered his challenge.
"it's disgusting," he said, pointing to me. "our new brother has
succeeded by instinct where for two years your 'science' has failed, and now
all you can offer is destructive criticism."
"i beg to differ," the brother with the pipe said. "to point out the
dangerous nature of his speech isn't destructive criticism. far from it. like
the rest of us, the new brother must learn to speak scientifically. he must be
trained!"
"so at last it occurs to you," brother jack said, pulling down the
corners of his mouth. "training. all is not lost. there's hope that our wild
but effective speaker may be tamed. the scientists perceive a possibility! very
well, it has been arranged; perhaps not scientifically but arranged
nevertheless. for the next few months our new brother is to undergo a period
of intense study and indoctrination under the guidance of brother hambro.
that's right," he said, as i started to speak. "i meant to tell you later."
"but that's a long time,

"your salary will continue," he said. "meanwhile, you'll be guilty of
no further unscientific speeches to upset our brothers' scientific tranquillity. in
fact, you are to stay completely out of harlem. perhaps then we'll see if you
brothers are as swift at organizing as you are at criticizing. it's your move,
brothers."
"i think brother jack is correct," a short, bald man said. "and i
don't think that we, of all people, should be afraid of the people's
enthusiasm. what we've got to do is to guide it into channels where it will
do the most good."
the rest were silent, the brother with the pipe looking at me
unbendingly.
"come," brother jack said. "let's get out of here. if we keep our
eyes on the real goal our chances are better than ever before. and let's
remember that science isn't a game of chess, although chess may be played

masses we must first organize ourselves. thanks to our new brother, things
have changed; we mustn't fail to make use of our opportunity. from now on
it's up to you."
"we shall see," the brother with the pipe said. "and as for the new
brother, a few talks with brother hambro wouldn't harm anyone."
hambro, i thought, going out, who the hell is he? i suppose i'm
lucky they didn't fire me. so now i've got to go to school again.
out in the night the group was breaking up and brother jack drew
me aside. "don't worry," he said. "you'll find brother hambro interesting, and
a period of training was inevitable. your speech tonight was a test which you
passed with flying colors, so now you'll be prepared for some real work.
here's the address; see brother hambro the first thing in the morning. he's
already been notified."
when i reached home, tiredness seemed to explode within me. my
nerves remained tense even after i had had a hot shower and crawled into
bed. in my disappointment, i

four months later when brother jack called the apartment at
midnight to tell me to be prepared to take a ride i became quite excited.
fortunately, i was awake and dressed, and when he drove up a few minutes
later i was waiting expectantly at the curb. maybe, i thought, as i saw him
hunched behind the wheel in his topcoat, this is what i've been waiting for.
"how have you been, brother?" i said, getting in.
"a little tired," he said. "not enough sleep, too many problems."
then, as he got the car under way, he became silent, and i

i was disappointed. i wanted no drink; i wanted to take the next
step that lay between me and an assignment. i followed him inside with a
surge of irritation.
the barroom was warm and quiet. the usual rows of bottles with
exotic names were lined on the shelves, and in the rear, where four men
argued in spanish over glasses of beer, a juke box, lit up green and red,
played "media luz." and as we waited for the bartender, i tried to figure the
purpose of the trip.
i had seen very little of brother jack after beginning my studies with
brother hambro. my life had been too tightly organized. but i should have
known that if anything was going to happen, brother hambro would have let
me know. instead, i was to meet him in the morning as usual. that hambro,
i thought, is he a fanatic teacher! a tall, friendly man, a lawyer and the
brotherhood's chief theoretician, he had proved to be a hard taskmaster.
between daily discussions with him and a rigid schedule of reading, i had
been working harder tha

 very much alive, and although i was under
orders to make no speeches, i had grown accustomed to being introduced as
a kind of hero.
yet it had been mainly a time for listening and, being a talker, i had
grown impatient. now i knew most of the brotherhood arguments so well --
those i doubted as well as those i believed -- that i could repeat them in my
sleep, but nothing had been said about my assignment. thus i had hoped the
midnight call meant some kind of action was to begin . . .
beside me, brother jack was still lost in thought. he seemed in no
hurry to go elsewhere or to talk, and as the slow-motion bartender mixed our
drinks i puzzled vainly as to why he had brought me here. before me, in the
panel where a mirror is usually placed, i could see a scene from a bullfight,
the bull charging close to the man and the man swinging the red cape in
sculptured folds so close to his body that man and bull seemed to blend in
one swirl of calm, pure motion. pure grace, i thought, looking above the bar

o where, larger than life, the pink and white image of a girl smiled down
from a summery beer ad on which a calendar said april one. then, as our
drinks were placed before us, brother jack came alive, his mood changing as
though in the instant he had settled whatever had been bothering him and
felt suddenly free.
"here, come back," he said, nudging me playfully. "she's only a
cardboard image of a cold steel civilization."
i laughed, glad to hear him joking. "and that?" i said, pointing to
the bullfight scene.
"sheer barbarism," he said, watching the bartender and lowering his
voice to a whisper. "but tell me, how have you found your work with brother
hambro?"
"oh, fine," i said.

hers who disliked my arena speech, i don't know. shall we
converse scientifically?"
he laughed, one of his eyes glowing brighter than the other. "don't
worry about the brothers," he said. "you'll do very well. brother hambro's
reports on you have been excellent."
"now, that's nice to hear," i.said, aware now of another bullfight
scene further down the bar in which the matador was being swept skyward
on the black bull's horns. "i've worked pretty hard trying to master the
ideology."
"master it," brother jack said, "but don't overdo it. don't let it
master you. there is nothing to put the people to sleep like dry ideology. the
ideal is to strike a medium between ideology and inspiration. say what the
people want to hear, but say it in such a way that they'll do what we wish."
he laughed. "remember too, that theory always comes after practice. act first,
theorize later; that's also a formula, a devastatingly effective one!"
he looked at me as though he did not see me and i could not tell
whether he w

the district offices were located in a converted church structure, the
main floor of which was occupied by a pawn shop, its window crammed with
loot that gleamed dully in the darkened street. we took a stair to the third
floor, entering a large room beneath a high gothic ceiling.
"it's down here," brother jack said, making for the end of the large
room where i saw a row of smaller ones, only one of which was lighted. and
now i saw a man appear in the door and limp forward.
"evening, brother jack," he said.
"why, brother tarp, i expected to find brother tobitt."
"i know. he was here but he had to leave," the man said. "he left
this envelope for you and said he'd call you later on tonight."
"good, good," brother jack said. "here, meet a new brother . . ."
"pleased to meet you," the brother said, smilin

"thanks," i said.
"so you liked it, did you, brother tarp?" brother jack said.
"the boy's all right with me," the man said.
"well, you're going to see a lot of him, he's your new spokesman."
"that's fine," the man said. "looks like we're going to get some
changes made."
"correct," brother jack said. "now let's take a look at his office and
we'll be going."
"sure, brother," tarp said, limping before me into one of the dark
rooms and snapping on a light. "this here is the one."
i looked into a small office, containing a flat-top desk with a
telephone, a typewriter on its table, a bookcase with shelves of books and
pamphlets, and a huge map of the world inscribed with ancient nautical signs
and a heroic figure of columbus to one side.
"if there's anything you need, just see brother tarp

"thanks, i shall," i said. "i'll get oriented in the morning."
"yes, and we'd better go so you can get some sleep. good night,
brother tarp. see that everything is ready for him in the morning."
"he won't have to worry about a thing, brother. good night."
"it's because we attract men like brother tarp there that we shall

ideologically he's a vigorous young man. he can be depended upon in the

"he sounds like a good man to have around," i said.
"you'll see," he said and lapsed into a silence that lasted until we
reached my door.
the committee was assembled in the hall with the high gothic
ceiling when i arrived, sitting in folding chairs around two small tables
pushed together to form a unit.
"well," brother jack said, "you are on time. very good, we favor
precision in our leaders."
"brother, i shall always try to be on time," i said.
"here he is, brothers and sisters," he said, "your new spokesman.

his red head jerked with surprise. "so?"

out a watch, "let us begin. i ha

curving line of the chest rising to the easy pulsing of his throat, to the
square, smooth chin, and saw a small x-shaped patch of adhesive upon the
subtly blended, velvet-over-stone, granite-over-bone, afro-anglo-saxon contour
of his cheek.
he leaned there, looking at us all with a remote aloofness in which i
sensed an unstated questioning beneath a friendly charm. sensing a possible
rival, i watched him warily, wondering who he was.
"ah so, brother tod clifton is late," brother jack said. "our leader of
the youth is late. why is this?"
the young man pointed to his cheek and smiled. "i had to see the
doctor," he said.
"what is this?" brother jack said, looking at the cross of adhesive on
the black skin.
"just a little encounter with the nationalists. with ras the exhorter's
boys," brother clifton said. and i heard a gasp from one of the women who
gazed at him with shining, compassionate eyes.
brother jack gave me a quick look. "brother, you have heard of ras?
he is the wild

"i don't recall so," i said.
"you'll hear of him soon enough. sit down, brother clifton; sit down.
you must be careful. you are valuable to the organization, you must not take
chances."
"this was unavoidable," the young man said.
"just the same," brother jack said, returning to the discussion with a
call for ideas.
"brother, are we still to fight against evictions?" i said.
"it has become a leading issue, thanks to you."
"then why not step up the fight?"
he studied my face. "what do you suggest?"
"well, since it has attracted so much attention, why not try to reach
the whole community with the issue?"
"and how would you suggest we go about it?"
"i suggest we get the community leaders on record in support of us."
"there are certain difficulties in fa

ce of this," brother jack said.
"most of the leaders are against us."
"but i think he's got something there," brother clifton said. "what if
we got them to support the issue whether they like us or not? the issue is a
community issue, it's non-partisan."
"sure," i said, "that's how it looks to me. with all the excitement
over evictions they can't afford to come out against us, not without appearing
to be against the best interests of the community . . ."
"so we have them across a barrel," clifton said.
"that is percepti

the others agreed.
"you see," brother jack said with a grin, "we've always avoided these
leaders, but the moment we start to advance on a broad front, sectarianism
becomes a burden to be cast off. any other suggestions?" he looked around.
"brother," i said, remembering now, "when i first came to harlem
one of the first things that impressed me was a man making a speech from a
ladder. he spoke very violently and with an accent, but he had an
enthusiastic audience . . . why can't we carry our program to the street in

so that was ras the exhorter, i thought.
"we'll have trouble with the extortor -- i mean the exhorter," a big
woman said. "his hoodlums would attack and denounce the white meat of a
roasted chicken."
we laughed.
"he goes wild when he sees black people and white people together,"
she said to me.
"we'll take care of that," brother clifton said, touching his cheek.
"very well, but no violence," brother jack said. "the brotherhood is
against violence and terror and provocation of any kind -- aggressive, that is.
understand, brother clifton?"
"i understand," he said.
"we will not countenance any aggressive violence. understand? nor
attacks upon officials or others who do not attack us. we are against all
forms of violence, do you understand?"
"yes, brother," i said.

looked like a southern "sudsbuster" was in charge of women's work, and
spoke in abstract, ideological terms. the shy-looking man with the liver

and this brother tod clifton, the youth leader, looked somehow like a

"we'll have to watch him now," i said.
"yes, we'd better," he said. "he won't stop fighting . . . and thanks
for getting rid of his knife."
"you didn't have to worry," i said. "he wouldn't kill his king."
he turned and looked at me as though he thought i might mean it;
then he smiled.
"for a while there i thought i was gone," he said.
as we headed for the district office i wondered what brother jack
would say about the fight.
"we'll have to overpower him with organization," i said.
"we'll do that, all right. but it's on the inside that ras is strong,"
clifton said. "on the inside he's dangerous."
"he won't get on the inside," i said. "he'd consider himself a traitor."
"no," clifton said, "he won't get on the inside. did you hear how he
was talking? did you hear what he was saying?"

ntil about two weeks later at our
downtown headquarters, where a meeting had been called to discuss strategy.
everyone had arrived before me. long benches were arranged at
one side of the room, which was hot and filled with smoke. usually such
meetings sounded like a prizefight or a smoker, but now everyone was silent.
the white brothers looked uncomfortable and some of the harlem brothers
belligerent. nor did they leave me time to think about it. no sooner had i
apologized for my lateness than brother jack struck the table with his gavel,
addressing his first remarks to me.
"brother, there seems to be a serious misunderstanding among some
of the brothers concerning your work and recent conduct," he said.
i stared at him blankly, my mind groping for connections. "i'm sorry,
brother jack," i said, "but i don't understand. you mean there's something
wrong with my work?"
"so it seems," he said, his face completely neutral. "certain charges
have just been made . . ."
"charges? have i failed to carry o

paper protruding from his pocket.
"yes, brothers," he said, "i brought charges, much as i hated to have
to do it. but i been watching the way things have been going and i've
decided that if they don't stop soon, this brother is going to make a fool out
of the brotherhood!"
there were some sounds of protest.
"yes, i said it and i mean it! this here brother constitutes one of
the greatest dangers ever confronted by our movement."
i looked at brother jack; his eyes were sparkling. i seemed to see
traces of a smile as he scribbled something on a pad. i was becoming very
hot.
"be more specific, brother," brother garnett, a white brother, said.
"these are serious charges and we all know that the brother's work has been
splendid. be specific."
"sho, i'll be specific," wrestrum boomed, suddenly whipping the
paper from his pocket, unrolling it and throwing it on the table. "this here's

"look, i don't know anything. what's on your mind? you have us all
here, so if you have anything to say, please get it over with."
"brothers, this man is a -- a -- opportunist! all you got to do is read
this article to see. i charge this man with using the brotherhood movement
to advance his own selfish interests."
"article?" then i remembered the interview which i had forgotten. i
met the eyes of the others as they looked from me to wrestrum.
"and what does it say about us?" brother jack said, pointing to the
magazine.
"say?" wrestrum said. "it doesn't say anything. it's all about him.
what he thinks, what he does; what he's going to do. not a word about the
rest of us who's been building the movement before he was ever heard of.

brother jack turned to me. "is this true?"
"i haven't read it," i said. "i had forgotten that i was interviewed."
"but you remember it now?" brother jack said.
"yes, i do now. and he happened to be in th

they were silent.
"hell, brother jack," wrestrum said, "it's right here in black and
white. he's trying to give people the idea that he's the whole brotherhood
movement."
"i'm doing nothing of the sort. i tried to get the editor to interview
brother tod clifton, you know that. since you know so little about what i'm
doing, why not tell the brothers what you're up to."
"i'm exposing a double-dealer, that's what i'm doing. i'm exposing
you. brothers, this man is a pure dee opportunist!"
"all right," i said, "expose me if you can, but

f plot?" one of the brothers said, leaning across the
table.
"just a plot," wrestrum said. "he aims to control the movement
uptown. he wants to be a dictator!"
the room was silent except for the humming of fans. they looked at
him with a new concern.
"these are very serious charges, brother," two brothers said in
unison.
"serious? i know they're serious. that's how come i brought them.
this opportunist thinks that because he's got a little more education he's
better than anybody else. he's what brother jack calls a petty -- petty
individualist!"
he struck the conference table with his fist, his eyes showing small
and round in his taut face. i wanted to punch that face. it no longer seemed
real, but a mask behind which the real face was probably laughing, both at
me and at the others. for he couldn't believe what he had said. it just wasn't
possible. he was the plotter and from the serious looks on the committee's
faces he was getting away with it. now several brothers started to speak at
once, and

 brother jack knocked for order.
"brothers, please!" brother jack said. "one at a time. what do you
know about this article?" he said to me.
"not very much," i said. "the editor of the magazine called to say he
was sending a reporter up for an interview. the reporter asked a few
questions and took a few pictures with a little camera. that's all i know."
"did you give the reporter a prepared handout?"
"i gave her nothing except a few pieces of our official literature. i
told her neither what to ask me nor what to write. i naturally tried to
co-operate. if an a

i felt it was my duty."
"brothers, this thing was arranged," wrestrum said. "i tell you this
opportunist had that reporter sent up there. he had her sent up and he told
her what to write."
"that's a contemptible lie," i said. "you were present and you know i
tried to get them to interview brother clifton!"
"who's a lie?"
"you're a liar and a fat-mouthed scoundrel. you're a liar and no
brother of mine."
"now he's calling me names. brothers, you heard him."
"let's not lose our tempers," brother jack said calmly. "brother
wrestrum, you've made serious charges. can you prove them?"
"i can prove them. all you have to do is read the magazine and
prove them for yourself;"
"it will be read. and what else?"
"all you have to do is listen to folks in harlem. all they talk about
is him. never nothing about what the rest of us do. i tell you, brothers, this
man constitutes a danger to the people of harlem. he ought to be thrown
out!"
"that is for the committee to decide," brother jack said. then to m

e,
"and what have you to say in your defense, brother?"
"in my defense?" i said, "nothing. i haven't anything to defend. i've
tried to do my work and if the brothers don't know that, then it's too late to
tell them. i don't know what's behind this, but i haven't gotten around to
controlling magazine writers. and i didn't realize that i was coming to stand
trial either."
"this was not intended as a trial," brother jack said. "if you're ever
put on trial, and i hope you'll never be, you'll know it. meantime, since this
is an emergency the committee asks that you leave the room while we read
and discuss the questioned interview."
i left the room and went into a vacant office, boiling with anger and
disgust. wrestrum had snatched me back to the south in the midst of one of
the top brotherhood committees and i felt naked. i could have throttled him
-- forcing me to take part in a childish dispute before the other

he'd know how to
handle this clown. were they taking him seriously just because he was black?
what was wrong with them anyway, couldn't they see that they were dealing
with a clown? but i would have gone to pieces had they laughed or even
smiled, i thought, for they couldn't laugh at him without laughing at me as
well . . . yet if they had laughed, it would have been less unreal -- where
the hell am i?
"you can come in now," a brother called to me; and i went out to
hear their decision.
"well," brother jack said, "we've all read the article, brother, and
we're happy to report that we found it harmless enough. true, it would have
been better had more wordage been given to other members of the harlem
district. but we found no evidence that you had anything to do with that.
brother wrestrum was mistaken."
his bland manner and the knowledge that they had wasted time to
see the truth released the anger within me.
"i'd say that he was criminally mistaken," i said.
"not criminal, over-zealous," he said.

 
 ___________________________
 
"to me it seems both criminal and over-zealous," i said.
"no, brother, not criminal."
"but he attacked my reputation . . ."
brother jack smiled. "only because he was sincere, brother. he was
thinking of the good of the brotherhood."
"but why slander me? i don't follow you, brother jack. i'm no
enemy, as he well knows. i'm a brother too," i said, seeing his smile.
"the brotherhood has many enemies, and we must not be too harsh
with brotherly mistakes."
then i saw the foolish, abashed expression on wrestrum's face and
relaxed.
"very well, brother jack," i said. "i suppose i should be glad you
found me innocent --"
"concerning the magazine article," he said, stabbing the air with his
finger.
something tensed in the back of my head; i got to my feet.
"concerning the article! you

jack looked at the table. "are you interested in our decision,
brother?"
"oh, yes," i said. "yes, i am. i'm interested in all manner of odd
behavior. who wouldn't be, when one wild man can make a roomful of what
i'd come to regard as some of the best minds in the country take him
seriously. certainly, i'm interested. otherwise i'd act like a sensible man and
run out of here!"
there were sounds of protest and brother jack, his face red, rapped
for order.
"perhaps i should address a few words to the brother," brother
macafee said.
"go ahead," brother jack said thickly.
"brother, we understand how you feel," brother macafee said, "but
you must understand that the movement has many enemies. this is very true,
and we are forced to think of the organization at the expense of our personal
feelings. the brotherhood is bigger than all of us. none of us as individuals
count when its safety is questioned. and be assured t

h still inwardly affirming that
belief, i felt a blighting hurt which prevented me from trying further to
defend myself. i stood there silently, waiting their decision. someone
drummed his fingers against the table top. i heard the dry-leaf rustle of
onionskin papers.
"be assured that you can depend upon the fairness and wisdom of
the committee," brother tobitt's voice drifted from the end of the table, but
there was smoke between us and i could barely see his face.
"the committee has decided," brother jack began crisply, "that until
all charges have been cleared, you are to have the choice of becoming
inactive in harlem, or accepting an assignment downtown. in the latter case
you are to wind up your present assignment immediately."
i felt weak in my legs. "you mean i am to give up my work?"
"unless you choose to serve the movement elsewhere."
"but can't you see --" i said, looking from face to face and seeing
the blank finality in their eyes.
"your assignment, should you decide to remain active,"

question."
suddenly i felt as though i had been spun like a top.
"the what!"
"the woman question. my pamphlet, 'on the woman question in
the united states,' will be your guide. and now, brothers," he said, his eyes
sweeping around the table, "the meeting is adjourned."
i stood there, hearing the rapping of his gavel echoing in my ears,
thinking the woman question and searching their faces for signs of
amusement, listening to the

"you can see, brother" -- the glow she gave the word was disturbing
-- "it is really the spiritual values of brotherhood that interest me. through
no effort of my own, i have economic security and leisure, but what is that,
really, when so much is wrong with the world? i mean when there is no
spiritual or emotional security, and no justice?"
she was slipping out of her coat now, looking earnestly into my face,
and i thought, is she a salvationist, a puritan-with-reverse-english? --
remembering brother jack's private description of wealthy members who, he
said, sought political salvation by contributing financially to the brotherhood.
she was going a little fast for me and i looked at her gravely.
"i can see that you've thought deeply about this thing," i said.
"i've tried," she said, "and it's most perplexing -- but make yourself
comfortable while i put away my things."
she was a small, delicately plump woman with raven hair in which a
thin streak of white had begun almost imperceptibly to show,

"of course, you're correct," she said. "i don't mean really primitive. i
suppose i mean forceful, powerful. it takes hold of one's emotions as well as
one's intellect. call it what you will, it has so much naked power that it goes
straight through one. i tremble just to think of such vitality."
i looked at her, so close now that i could see a single jet-black
strand of out-of-place hair. "yes," i said, "the emotion is there; but it's
actually our scientific approach that releases it. as brother jack says, we're
nothing if not organizers. and the emotion isn't merely released, it's guided,
channelized -- that is the real source of our effectiveness. after all, this very
good wine can please emotion, but i doubt seriously that it can organize
anything."
she leaned gracefully forward, her arm along the back of the sofa,
saying, "yes, and you do both in your speeches. one just has to respond,
even when one isn't too clear as to your meaning. only i do know what

would i return for further discussion, she wanted to know.
"yes, of course," i said.
"oh, brother," she said.
i hung up with a mixture of relief and anxiety, unable to shrug off
the notion that i had been tested and had failed. i went through the next
week puzzling over it, and even more confused because i knew nothing
definite of where i stood. i tried to detect any changes in my relations with
brother jack and the others, but they gave no sign. and even if they had, i
wouldn't have known its definite meaning, for it might have had to do with
the charges. i was caught between guilt and innocence, so that now they
seemed one and the same. my nerves were in a state of constant tension, my
face took on a stiff, non-committal expression, beginning to look like brother
jack's and the other leaders'. then i relaxed a bit; work had to be done and
i would play the waiting game. and despite my guilt and un

it was all i could do to make myself go, and i arrived late. the
room was sweltering; three small fans stirred the heavy air, and the brothers
sat in their shirtsleeves around a scarred table upon which a pitcher of iced
water glistened with beads of moisture.
"brothers, i'm sorry i'm late," i apologized. "there were some
important last-minute details concerning tomorrow's lecture that kept me."
"then you might have saved yourself the trouble and the committee
this lost time," brother jack said.
"i don't understand you," i said, suddenly feverish.
"he means that you are no longer to concern yourself with the
woman question. that's ended," brother tobitt said; and i braced myself for
the attack, but before i could respond brother jack fired a startling question
at me.
"what has become of brother tod clifton?"
"brother clifton -- why, i haven't seen him in weeks. i've been too
busy downtown here. what's happened?"
"he has disappeared," brother jack said, "disappeared! so don't wast

"but how long has this been known?"
brother jack struck the table. "all we know is that he's gone. let's
get on with our business. you, brother, are to return to harlem immediately.
we're facing a crisis there, since brother tod clifton has not only disappeared
but failed in his assignment. on the other hand, ras the exhorter and his
gang of racist gangsters are taking advantage of this and are increasing their
agitation. you are to get back there and take measures to regain our strength

who knew but that they were the saviors, the true leaders, the bearers of
something precious? the stewards of something uncomfortable, burdensome,
which they hated because, living outside the realm of history, there was no
one to applaud their value and they themselves failed to understand it. what
if brother jack were wrong? what if history was a gambler, instead of a force
in a laboratory experiment, and the boys his ace in the hole? what if history
was not a reasonable citizen, but a madman full of paranoid guile and these
boys his agents, his big surprise! his own revenge? for they were outside, in
the dark with sambo, the dancing paper doll; taking it on the lambo with my
fallen brother, tod clifton (tod, tod) running and dodging the forces of
history instead of making a dominating stand.

one to break down and shout. nothing to give you that good old frightened
feeling. the story's too short and too simple. his name was clifton, tod

he had struggled for brotherhood on a hundred street corners and he
thought it would make him more human, but he died like any dog in a road.
"all right, all right," i called out, feeling desperate. it wasn't the way
i wanted it to go, it wasn't political. brother jack probably wouldn't approve
of it at all, but i had to keep going as i could go.
"listen to me standing up on this so-called mountain!" i shouted.
"let me tell it as it truly was! his name was tod clifton and he was full of

in the dream that surprise was the normal reaction and that the lack of it
was to be distrusted, a warning.
i stood just inside the room, watching them as i slipped off my
jacket, seeing them grouped around a small table upon which there rested a
pitcher of water, a glass and a couple of smoking ash trays. one half of the
room was dark and only one light burned, directly above the table. they
regarded me silently, brother jack with a smile that went no deeper than his
lips, his head cocked to one side, studying me with his penetrating eyes; the
others blank-faced, looking out of eyes that were meant to reveal nothing and
to stir profound uncertainty. the smoke rose in spirals from their cigarettes
as they sat perfectly contained, waiting. so you came, after all, i thought,
going over and dropping into one of the chairs. i rested my arm on the
table, noticing its coolness.
"well, how did it go?" brother jack said, ext

hall.
"sooo! is that all the great tactician has to tell us?" brother tobitt
said. "in what direction were they moved?"
i looked at him, aware of the numbness of my emotions; they had
flowed in one channel too long and too deeply.
"that's for the committee to decide. they were aroused, that was all
we could do. we tried again and again to reach the committee for guidance
but we couldn't."
"so?"
"so we went ahead on my personal responsibility."
brother jack's eyes narrowed. "what was that?" he said. "your what?"
"my personal responsibility," i said.
"his personal responsibility," brother jack said. "did you hear that,
brothers? did i hear him correctly. where did you get it, brother?" he said.
"this is astounding, where did you get it?"
"from your ma --" i started and caught myself in time. "from the

there was a pause. i looked at him, his face reddening, as i tried to
get my bearings. a nerve trembled in the center of my stoma

"you see, he's sorry we missed it," brother jack said. he held up his
hand. i could see the deeply etched lines in his palm. "the great tactician of
personal responsibility regrets our absence . . ."
doesn't he see how i feel, i thought, can't he see why i did it?
what's he trying to do? tobitt's a fool, but why is he taking it up?
"you could have taken the next step," i said, forcing the words. "we
went as far as we could . . ."
"on your personal re-spon-si-bility," brother jack said, bowing his
head in time with the words.

 "i don't know what this is all about, brother. what are
you trying to say?"
"now there is a good question, brothers. sit down, please, it's hot.
he wants to know what we're trying to say. we have here not only an
extraordinary tactician, but one who has an appreciation for subtleties of
expression."
"yes, and for sarcasm, when it's good," i said.
"and for discipline? sit down, please, it's hot . . ."
"and for discipline. and for orders and consultation when it's
possible to have them," i said.
brother jack grinned. "sit down, sit down -- and for patience?"
"when i'm not sleepy and exhausted," i said, "and not overheated as
i am just now."
"you'll learn," he said. "you'll learn and you'll surrender yourself to it
even under such conditions. especially under such conditions; that's its value.
that makes it patience."
"yes, i guess i'm learning now," i said. "right now."
"brother," he said drily, "you have no idea how much you're learning
-- please sit down."
"all right," i said, sitting down again.

 "but while ignoring my
personal education for a second i'd like you to remember that the people
have little patience with us these days. we could use this time more
profitably."
"and i could tell you that politicians are not personal persons,"
brother jack said, "but i won't. how could we use it more profitably?"
"by organizing their anger."
"so again our great tactician has relieved himself. today he's a busy
man. first an oration over the body of brutus, and now a lecture on the
patience of the negro people."
tobitt was enjoying himself. i could see his cigarette tremble in his
lips as he struck a match to light it.
"i move we issue his remarks in a pamphlet," he said, running his
finger over his chin. "they should create a natural phenomenon .

this had better stop right here, i thought. my head was getting
lighter and my chest felt tight.
"look," i said, "an unarmed man was killed. a brother, a leading
member shot down by a policeman. we had lost our prestige in the
community. i saw the chance to rally the people, so i acted. if that was
incorrect, then i did wrong, so say it straight without this crap. it'll take
more than sarcasm to deal with that crowd out there."
brother jack reddened; the others exchanged glances.
"he hasn't read the newspapers," someone said.
"you forget," brother jack said, "it wasn't necessary; he was there."
"yes, i was there," i said. "if you're referring to the killing."
"there, you see," brother jack said. "he was on the scene."
brother tobitt pushed the table edge with his palms. "and still you

my nose twitched. i turned toward him deliberately, forcing a grin.
"how could there be a side show without

"now we're making progress," brother jack said, straddling his chair.

all right, i'll answer. under your leadership, a traitorous merchant of vile
instruments of anti-negro, anti-minority racist bigotry has received the funeral
of a hero. do you still ask what's wrong?"
"but nothing was done about a traitor," i said.
he half-stood, gripping the back of his chair. "we all heard you

"we dramatized the shooting down of an unarmed black man."

"that black man, as you call him, was a traitor," brother jack said.
"a traitor!"
"what is a traitor, brother?" i asked, feeling an angry amusement as
i counted on my fingers. "he was a man and a negro; a man and a brother;
a man and a traitor, as you say; then he was a dead man, and alive or dead
he was jam-full of contradictions. so full that he attracted half of harlem to
come out and stand in the sun in answer to our call. so what is a traitor?"
"so now he retreats," brother jack said. "observe him, brothers.

i'm intrigued. you were saying?"
i watched tobitt. he glared. i grinned.
"i was saying that up here we know that the policemen didn't care
about clifton's ideas. he was shot because he was black and because he
resisted. mainly because he was black."
brother jack frowned. "you're riding 'race' again. but how do they
feel about the dolls?"
"i'm riding the race i'm forced to ride," i said. "and as for the dolls,
they know that as far as the cops were concerned clifton could have been
selling song sheets. bibles, matzos. if he'd been white, he'd be alive. or if
he'd accepted being pushed around . . ."
"black and white, white and black," tobitt said. "must we listen to

only thing wrong is that your source is too narrow. you don't really think
that crowd turned out today because clifton was a member of the
brotherhood?"
"and why did they turn out?" jack said, getting set as if to pounce
forward.
"because we gave them the opportunity to express their feelings, to
affirm themselves."
brother jack rubbed his eye. "do you know that you have become
quite a theoretician?" he said. "you astound me."
"i doubt that, brother, but there's nothing like isolating a man to
make him think," i said.
"yes, that's true; some of our best ideas have been thought in prison.
only you haven't been in prison, brother, and you were not hired to think.
had you forgotten that? if so, listen to me: you were not hired to think." he
was speaking very deliberately and i thought, so . . . so here it is, naked

"your private source tells you differently. history's made at night, eh,

"i've warned you," tobitt said.
"brother to brother, brother," i said, "try getting around more. you
might learn that today was the first time that they've listened to our appeals
in weeks. and i'll tell you something else: if we don't follow through on what
was done today, this might be the last . . ."
"so, he's finally gotten around to predicting the future," brother jack
said.
"it's possible . . . though i hope not."
"he's in touch with god," tobitt said. "the black god."
i looked at him and grinned. he had gray eyes and his irises were
very wide, the muscles ridged out on his jaws. i had his guard down and he
was swinging wild.
"not with god, nor with your wife, brother," i told him. "i've never

"no," brother jack said, getting to his feet, "you'll stand on the

your decisions and it is not its practice to give undue importance to the
mistaken notions of the people. what's happened to your discipline?"

ing seemed to move out from under me, and out of the
corner of my eye i was suddenly aware of objects on the dark side of the
hall. "but didn't anyone see what happened today?" i said. "what was that, a
dream? what was ineffective about that crowd?"
"such crowds are only our raw materials, one of the raw materials to
be shaped to our program."
i looked around the table and shook my head. "no wonder they
insult me and accuse us of betraying them . . ."
there was a sudden movement.
"repeat that," brother jack shouted, stepping forward.
"it's true, i'll repeat it. until this afternoon they've been saying that
the brotherhood betrayed them. i'm telling you what's been said to me, and
that it why brother clifton disappeared."
"that's an indefensible lie," brother jack said.
and i looked at him slowly now, thinking, if this is it, this is it . . .
"don't call me that," i said softly. "don't ever call me that, none of you. i've
told you what i've heard." my hand was in my pocket now, brother tarp's
