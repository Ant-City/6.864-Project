him we yield the armour of the prince.
    how likes don balthazar of this device?

  balt.  right well, my liege, if this proviso were:
    that don horatio bear us company,
    whom i admire and love for chivalry.

  king.  horatio, leave him not that loves thee so.
    now let us hence, to see our soldiers paid,
    and feast our prisoner as our friendly guest.

                [portugal:  the viceroy's palace.]

                enter viceroy, alexandro, villuppo.

  vice.  is our ambassador dispatch'd for spain?

  alex.  two days, my liege, are past since his depart.

  vice.  and tribute payment gone along with him?

  alex.  aye, my good lord.

  vice.  then rest we here a-while in our unrest;
    and feed our sorrows with inward sighs,
    for deepest cares break never into tears.
    but wherefore sit i in a regal throne?
    this better fits a wretch's endless moan.
    yet this is higher then my fortunes reach,
    and therefore better

ice.  speak on; i'll guerdon thee, whate'er it be.
    mine ear is ready to receive ill news,
    my heart grown hard 'gainst mischief's battery;
    stand up, i say, and tell thy tale at large.

  villup.  then hear that truth which these mine eyes have seen:
    when both the armies were in battle join'd.
    don balthazar amidst the thickest troops,
    to win renown, did wondrous feats of arms;
    amongst the rest i saw him hand-to-hand
    in single fight with their lord general.
    till alexandro, that here counterfeits
    under the colour of a duteous friend,
    discharg'd a pistol at the princes back,
    as though he would have slain their general,
    but therewithal don balthazar fell down;
    and when he fell, then we began to fly;
    but, had he liv'd, the day had sure been ours.

  alex.  o wicked forgery!  o trait'rous miscreant!

  vice.  hold thou thy peace!  but now, villuppo, say:
    where then became the carcass of my son?

  villup.  i saw them drag it to the spanish

    the end is crown of every work well done;
    the sickle comes not till the corn be ripe.
    be still, and, ere i lead thee from this place,
    i'll show thee balthazar in heavy case.

[act iii.  scene 1.]

                [the portuguese court.]

                enter viceroy of portingal, nobles, alexandro, villuppo.

  viceroy.  infortunate condition of kings,
    seated amidst so many helpless doubts!
    first, we are plac'd upon extremest height,
    and oft supplanted with exceeding hate,
    but ever subject to the wheel of chance;
    and at our highest never joy we so
    as we doubt and dread our overthrow.
    so striveth not the waves with sundry winds
    as fortune toileth in the affairs of kings,
    that would be fear'd, yet fear to be belov'd,
    sith fear and love to kings is fl

attery.
    for instance, lordings, look upon your king,
    by hate deprived of his dearest son,
    the only hope of our successive line.

  nob.  i had not thought that alexandro's heart
    had been envenom'd with such extreme hate;
    but now i see that words have several works,
    and there's no credit in the countenance.

  vil.  no, for, my lord, had you beheld the train
    that feigned love had colour'd in his looks
    when he in camp consorted balthazar,
    far more inconstant had you thought the sun,
    that hourly coasts the center of the earth,
    then alexandro's purpose to the prince.

  vice.  no more, villuppo! thou hast said enough,
    and with th

y words thou slay'st our wounded thoughts.
    nor shall i longer dally with the world,
    procrastinating alexandro's death.
    go, some of you, and fetch the traitor forth,
    that, as he is condemned, he may die.

                enter alexandro, with a noble-man and
                halberts.

  nob. in such extremes will nought but patience serve.

  alex.  but in extremes what patience shall i use?
    nor discontents it me to leave the world,
    with whom there nothing can prevail but wrong.

  nob.  yet hope the best.

  alex.                         'tis heav'n is my hope:
    as for the earth, it is too much infect
    to yield me hope of any of her mould.

  vice.  why linger ye? bring forth that daring fiend,
    and let him d

    whereof, as heav'ns have known my secret thoughts,
    so am i free from this suggestion!

  vice.  no more, i say; to the tortures!  when?
    bind him, and burn his body in those flames,

                they bind him to the stake.

    that shall prefigure those unquenched fires
    of phlegethon prepared for his soul.

  alex.  my guiltless death will be aveng'd on thee!
    on thee, villuppo, that hath malice'd thus,
    or for thy meed hast falsely me accus'd!

  vil.  nay, alexandro, if thou menace me,
    i'll lend a hand to send thee to the lake
    where those thy words shall perish with thy works,
    injurious traitor, monstrous homicide!

                enter ambassador.

  ambass.  stay!  hold a-while!
    and here, with pardon of his majesty,
    lay hands upon villuppo!

  vice.                        ambassador,
   what news hath urg'd this sudden enterance?

  ambass.  know, sovereign lord, that balthazar doth live.

  vice.  what say'st thou?  liveth balthazar

are happy witnesses of his highness' health.

                the king looks on the letters, and proceeds.

  vice. [reads]  "thy son doth live; your tribute is receiv'd;
    thy peace is made, and we are satisfied.
    the rest resolve upon as things propos'd
    for both our honours and thy benefit."

  ambass.  these are his highness' farther articles.

                he gives him more letters.

  vice.  accursed wretch to intimate these ills
    against the life and reputation
    of noble alexandro!  come, my lord, unbind him!
    [to alexandro]  let him unbind thee that is bound to death,
    to make acquittal for thy discontent.

                they unbind him.

  alex.  dread lord, in kindness you could do no less,
    upon report of such a damned fact;
    but thus we see our innocence hath sav'd
    the hopeless life which thou, villuppo, sought
    by thy suggestions to have massacred.

  vice.  say, false villuppo, wherefore didst thou thus
    falsely betray lord alexandro's life

?
    him whom thou know'st that no unkindness else
    but even the slaughter of our dearest son
    could once have mov'd us to have misconceiv'd.

  alex.  say, treacherous villuppo; tell the king!
    or wherein hath alexandro us'd thee ill?

  vil.  rent with remembrance of so foul a deed,
    my guilty soul submits me to thy doom,
    for, not for alexandro's injuries,
    but for reward and hope to be prefer'd,
    thus have i shamelessly hazarded his life.

  vice.  which, villain, shall be ransom'd with thy death,
    and not so mean a torment as we here
    devis'd for him who thou said'st slew our son,
    but with the bitterest torments and extremes
    that may be yet invented for thine end.

                alexandro seems to entreat.

    entreat me not!  go, take the traitor hence!

                exit villuppo.

    and, alexandro, let

 us honour thee
    with public notice of thy loyalty.
    to end those things articulated here
    by our great lord, the mighty king of spain,
    we with our council will deliberate.
    come, alexandro, keep us company.

                exeunt.

  hiero.  oh eyes!  no eyes but fountains fraught with tears;
    oh life! no life, but lively form of death;
    oh world! no world, but mass of public wrongs,
