 building steadily on the discoveries of their
predecessors  to  piece  together  an  ever  fuller  understanding  of  how  the  universe  works. and  now,
long  after  einstein  articulated  his  quest  for  a  unified  theory  but  came  up  empty-handed,  physicists
believe  they  have  finally  found  a  framework  for  stitching  these  insights  together  into  a  seamless
whole—a  single  theory  that,  in  principle,  is  capable  of  describing  all  physical  phenomena.  the
theory, superstring theory, is the subject of this book.

i wrote the elegant universe in an attempt to make the remarkable insights emerging from the
forefront  of  physics  research  accessible  to  a  broad  spectrum  of  readers,  especially  those  with  no
training in mathematics or physics. through public lectures on superstring theory i have given over
the past few years, i have witnessed a widespread yearning to understand what current research says

 contagious excitement of researchers closing in on the long-sought
unified theory. for the avid reader of popular science, i have tried to explain many of the exhilarating
advances in our understanding of the cosmos that have come to light during the last decade. and for
my colleagues in other scientific disciplines, i hope this book will give an honest and balanced sense
of why string theorists are so enthusiastic about the progress being made in the search for the ultimate
theory of nature.

superstring theory casts a wide net. it is a broad and deep subject that draws on many of the
central discoveries in physics. since the theory unifies the laws of the large and of the small, laws
that govern physics out to the farthest reaches of the cosmos and down to the smallest speck of matter,

there  are  many  avenues  by  which  one  can  approach  the  subject.  i  have  chosen  to  focus  on  our
evolving understanding of space and time. i find this to be an especially gripping developmental path,

impact  superstring  theory  has  on  our  conception  of  space  and  time,  and  in  a  couple  of  the  later
chapters i describe some of the discoveries in which i had the fortune to take part. although i hope the
reader  will  enjoy  reading  these  "inside"  accounts,  i  realize  that  they  may  leave  an  exaggerated
impression of the role i have played in the development of superstring theory. so let me take this
opportunity to acknowledge the more than one thousand physicists around the world who are crucial
and dedicated participants in the effort to fashion the ultimate theory of the universe. i apologize to all

chosen and the length limitations of a general presentation.

he unhappy amalgam of these two theories. even if you are willing
to keep the deep interior of a black hole and the beginning of the universe shrouded in mystery, you
can't help feeling that the hostility between quantum mechanics and general relativity cries out for a
deeper  level  of  understanding.  can  it  really  be  that  the  universe  at  its  most  fundamental  level  is
divided, requiring one set of laws when things are large and a different, incompatible set when things
are small?

superstring theory, a young upstart compared with the venerable edifices of quantum mechanics
and  general  relativity,  answers  with  a  resounding  no.  intense  research  over  the  past  decade  by
physicists and mathematicians around the world has revealed that this new approach to describing

matter  at  its  most  fundamental  level  resolves  the  tension  between  general  relativity  and  quantum
mechanics. in fact, superstring theory shows more: within this new framework, general relativity and

theory, the marriage of the laws of the large and the small is not only happy but inevitable.

that's part of the good news. but superstring theory—string theory, for short—takes this union
one giant step further. for three decades, einstein sought a unified theory of physics, one that would
interweave  all  of  nature's  forces  and  material  constituents  within  a  single  theoretical  tapestry.  he
failed. now, at the dawn of the new millennium, proponents of string theory claim that the threads of
this elusive unified tapestry finally have been revealed. string theory has the potential to show that all

our  deepest  theoretical  understanding  of  the  universe  will  be  composed  of  a  mathematically
inconsistent patchwork of two powerful yet conflicting explanatory frameworks.

physicists  have  made  numerous  attempts  at  modifying  either  general  relativity  or  quantum
mechanics  in  some  manner  so  as  to  avoid  the  conflict,  but  the  attempts,  although  often  bold  and
ingenious, have met with failure after failure.

that is, until the discovery of superstring theory.8

nothing but music: the essentials of superstring theory

music has long since provided the metaphors of choice for those puzzling over questions of cosmic
concern. from the ancient pythagorean "music of the spheres" to the "harmonies of nature" that have
guided  inquiry  through  the  ages,  we  have  collectively  sought  the  song  of  nature  in  the  gentle
wanderings  of  celestial  bodies  and  the  riotous  fulminations  of  subatomic  parti

cles.  with  the
discovery of superstring theory, musical metaphors take on a startling reality, for the theory suggests
that the microscopic landscape is suffused with tiny strings whose vibrational patterns orchestrate the
evolution  of  the  cosmos.  the  winds  of  change,  according  to  superstring  theory,  gust  through  an
aeolian universe.

by contrast, the standard model views the elementary constituents of the universe as pointlike
ingredients  with  no  internal  structure.  as  powerful  as  this  approach  is  (as  we  have  me

fact, by diligently following this precise notion of
symmetry to its mathematical conclusion, physicists during the last few decades have found theories
in  which  matter  particles  and  messenger  particles  are  far  more  closely  intertwined  than  anyone
previously  thought  possible.  such  theories,  which  unite  not  only  the  forces  of  nature  but  also  the
material  constituents,  have  the  greatest  possible  symmetry  and  for  this  reason  have  been  called
supersymmetric. superstring theory, as we shall see, is both the progenitor and the pinnacle example

of a supersymmetric framework.

the nature of physical law

imagine a universe in which the laws of physics are as ephemeral as the tastes of fashion—changing
from year to year, from week to week, or even from moment to moment. in such a world, assuming
that the changes do not disrupt basic life processes, you would never experience a dull moment, to
say the least. the simplest acts would be an adventure, since random variati

insights  of  ferdinando  gliozzi  of  the  university  of  turin,  scherk,  and  david  olive  of  imperial
college put this pairing into the proper light. the new string theory incorporated supersymmetry, and
the  observed  pairing  of  bosonic  and  fermionic  vibrational  patterns  reflected  this  highly  symmetric
character. supersymmetric string theory—superstring theory, that is—had been born. moreover, the
work of gliozzi, scherk, and olive had one other crucial result: they showed that the troublesome
tachyon vibration of the bosonic string does not afflict the superstring. slowly, the pieces of the string
puzzle were falling into place.

nevertheless, the major initial impact of the work of ramond, and also of neveu and schwarz,
was not actually in string theory. by 1973, the physicists julius wess and bruno zumino realized that

theory increasingly becoming a subject on the fringe—the insights of wess and zumino launched a
tremendous amount of subsequent research on what has come to be called supersymmetric quantum
field theory. the supersymmetric standard model, discussed in the preceding section, is one of the
crowning theoretical achievements of these pursuits; we now see that, through historical twists and
turns, even this point-particle theory owes a great debt to string theory.

with the resurgence of superstring theory in the mid-1980s, supersymmetry has re-emerged in the
context  of  its  original  discovery.  and  in  this  framework,  the  case  for  supersymmetry  goes  well
beyond that presented in the preceding section. string theory is the only way we know of to merge
general relativity and quantum mechanics. but it's only the supersymmetric version of string theory
that  avoids  the  pernicious  tachyon  problem  and  that  has  fermionic  vibrational  patterns  that  can

ther string theory or something else—should be the way it is because
there  simply  is  no  other  possibility.  if  we  were  to  discover  that  there  is  only  one  logically  sound
theory  incorporating  the  basic  ingredients  of  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics,  many  feel  that  we
would have reached the deepest understanding of why the universe has the properties it does. in short,
this would be unified-theory paradise.8

as we will see in chapter 12, recent research has taken superstring theory one giant step closer
to this unified utopia by showing that the five different theories are, remarkably, actually five different
ways  of  describing one  and  the  same  overarching  theory.  superstring  theory has  the  uniqueness
pedigree.

things  seem  to  be  falling  into  place,  but,  as  we  will  discuss  in  the  next  chapter,  unification

through string theory does require one more significant departure from conventional wisdom.

are  these  properties  reasons  to  accept  the  reality  of  superstrings?  do  mathematics  and
aesthetics supplant and transcend mere experiment?3

elsewhere, glashow went on to say,

superstring theory is so ambitious that it can only be totally right, or totally wrong. the
only problem is that the mathematics is so new and difficult that we won't know which for
decades to come.4

and he even questioned whether string theorists should "be paid by physics departments and allowed
to pervert impressionable students," warning that string theory was was undermining science, much as
medieval theology did during the middle ages.5

cosmology and superstring theory

there remains a sliver of figure 14.1, between the big bang and the planck time, that we have not yet
discussed. by blindly applying the equations of general relativity to that region, physicists have found
that the universe continues to get ever smaller, ever hotter, and ever denser, as we move backward in
time toward the bang. at time zero, as the size of the universe vanishes, the temperature and density
soar to infinity, giving us the most extreme signal that this theoretical model of the

finally be able to answer questions such as how the universe began, and why it has evolved to the
form we behold in the heavens and on earth. there is, of course, much uncharted territory between
where we are and where full answers to these fundamental questions lie. but the development of a
quantum theory of gravity through superstring theory lends credence to the hope that we now possess
theoretical tools for pushing into the vast regions of the unknown, and, no doubt after many a struggle,
possibly emerging with answers to some of the deepest questions ever posed.

are there limits to explanation?

explaining everything, even in the circumscribed sense of understanding all aspects of the forces and
the elementary constituents of the universe, is one of the greatest challenges science has ever faced.
and for the first time, superstring theory gives us a framework that appears to have sufficient depth to
meet  the  challenge.  but  will  we  ever  realize  the  promise  of  the  theory  fully  and,  for  example,
calculate the masses of the quarks or the strength of the electromagnetic force, numbers whose precise
values dictate so much about the universe? as in the previous sections, we will have to surmount
numerous theoretical hurdles on the way to these goals—currently, the most prominent is achieving a
full nonperturbative for

extreme contortions in which their spatial fabric tears apart and then repairs itself. who could have
guessed that the merging of gravity and quantum mechanics into a unified theory of all matter and all
forces would yield such a revolution in our understanding of how the universe works?

no  doubt,  there  are  even  grander  surprises  in  store  for  us  as  we  continue  to  seek  a  full  and
calculationally tractable understanding of superstring theory. already, through studies in m-theory,
we have seen glimpses of a strange new domain of the universe lurking beneath the planck length,
possibly one in which there is no notion of time or space. at the opposite extreme, we have also seen
that our universe may merely be one of the innumerable frothing bubbles on the surface of a vast and
turbulent cosmic ocean called the multiverse. these ideas are at the current edge of speculation, but
they may presage the next leap in our understanding of the
