  cressida. who were those went by?
  alexander. queen hecuba and helen.
  cressida. and whither go they?
  alexander. up to the eastern tower,
    whose height commands as subject all the vale,
    to see the battle. hector, whose patience
    is as a virtue fix'd, to-day was mov'd.
    he chid andromache, and struck his armourer;
    and, like as there were husbandry in war,
    before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
    and to the field goes he; where every flower
    did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
    in hector's wrath.
  cressida. what was his cause of anger?
  alexander. the noise goes, this: there is among the greeks
    a lord of troyan blood, nephew to hector;
    they call him ajax.
  cressida. good; and what of him?
  alexander. they say he is a very man per se,

  hector. ho! bid my trumpet sound.
  cassandra. no notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother!
  hector. be gone, i say. the gods have heard me swear.
  cassandra. the gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows;
    they are polluted off'rings, more abhorr'd
    than spotted livers in the sacrifice.
  andromache. o, be persuaded! do not count it holy
    to hurt by being just. it is as lawful,
    for we would give much, to use violent thefts
    and rob in the behalf of charity.
  cassandra. it is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
    but vows to every purpose must not hold.
    unarm, sweet hector.
  hector. hold you still, i say.
    mine honour keeps the weather of my fate.
    life every man holds dear; but the dear man
    holds honour far more precious dear than life.

    how now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?

  hector. no, faith, young troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
    i am to-day i' th' vein of chivalry.
    let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
    and tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
    unarm thee, go; and doubt thou not, brave boy,
    i'll stand to-day for thee and me and troy.
  troilus. brother, you have a vice of mercy in you
    which better fits a lion than a man.
  hector.

ay is ominous.
    therefore, come back.
  hector. aeneas is a-field;
    and i do stand engag'd to many greeks,
    even in the faith of valour, to appear
    this morning to them.
  priam. ay, but thou shalt not go.
  hector. i must not break my faith.
    you know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
    let me not shame respect; but give me leave
    to take that course by your consent and voice
    which you do here forbid me, royal priam.
  cassandra. o priam, yield not to him!
  andromache. do not, dear father.
  hector. andromache, i am offended with you.
    upon the love you bear me, get you in.

    makes all these bodements.
  cassandra. o, farewell, dear hector!
    look how thou diest. look how thy eye turns pale.
    look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents.
    hark how troy roars; how hecuba cries out;
    how poor andromache shrills her dolours forth;
