 his stern blue glazzies on me. so i said, bold:

â€œwith respect, sir, i object very strongly to what you said then. i am not a common criminal, sir, and i am not unsavoury. the others may be unsavoury but i am not.â€ the chief chasso went all purple and creeched:

â€œyou shut your bleeding hole, you. donâ€™t you know who this is?â€

â€œall right, all right,â€ said this big veck. then he turned to the governor and said: â€œyou can use him as a trail-blazer. heâ€™s young, bold, vicious. brodsky will deal with him tomorrow and you can sit in and watch brodsky. it works all right, donâ€™t worry about that. this vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.â€

and those hard slovos, brothers, were like the beginning of my freedom.

that very same evening i was dragged down nice and gentle by brutal tolchocking chassos to viddy the governor in his holy of holies holy office. the governor looked very weary at me and said: â€œi donâ€™t suppose you know who

so i said, trying to be like respectful and accomodating:

â€œsir.â€ and then the chief chasso, who was standing all red and burly behind the governorâ€™s chair, creeched:

â€œshut your filthy hole, you scum.â€

â€œall right, all right,â€ said the like tired and fagged-out governor. â€œyou, 6655321, are to be reformed. tomorrow you go to this man brodsky. it is believed that you will be able to leave state custody in a little over a fortnight. in a little over a fortnight you will be out again in the big free world, no longer a number. i suppose,â€ and he snorted a bit here, â€œthat prospect pleases you?â€ i said nothing so the chief chasso creeched:

â€œanswer, you filthy young swine, when the governor asks you a question.â€ so i said:

â€œoh, yes, sir. thank you very much, sir. iâ€™ve done my best here, really i have. iâ€™m very gratef

œwell, alex boy, little 6655321 as was, you have copped it lucky and no mistake. you are really going to enjoy it here.â€

after i had been given a nice chasha of real horrorshow coffee and some old gazettas and mags to look at while peeting it, this first veck in white came in, the one who had like signed for me, and he said: â€œaha, there you are,â€ a silly sort of a veshch to say but it didnâ€™t sound silly, this veck being so like nice. â€œmy name,â€ he said, â€œis dr. branom. iâ€™m dr. brodskyâ€™s assistant. with your permission, iâ€™ll just give you the usual brief overall examination.â€ and he took the old stetho out of his right carman. â€œwe must make sure youâ€™re quite fit, mustnâ€™t we? yes indeed, we must.â€ so while i lay there with my pyjama top off and he did this, that and the other, i said:

â€œwhat exactly is it, sir, that youâ€™re going to do?â€

â€œoh,â€ said dr. branom, his cold stetho going all down my back, â€œitâ€™s quite simple, really. we just show you s

e coat. then i noticed that underneath the projection holes was like all frosted glass and i thought i viddied shadows of like people moving behind it and i thought i slooshied somebody cough kashl kashl kashl. but then all i could like notice was how weak i seemed to be, and i put that down to changing over from prison pishcha to this new rich pishcha and the vitamins injected into me. â€œright,â€ said the wheelchair-wheeling veck, â€œnow iâ€™ll leave you. the show will commence as soon as dr. brodsky arrives. hope you enjoy it.â€ to be truthful, brothers, i did not really feel that i wanted to viddy any film-show this afternoon. i was just not in the mood. i would have liked much better to have a nice quiet spatchka on the bed, nice and quiet and all on my oddy knocky. i felt very limp.

what happened now was that one white-coated veck strapped my gulliver to a like head-rest, singing to himself all the time some vonny cally pop-song. â€œwhatâ€™s this for?â€ i said. and this veck replie

d, smecking:

â€œhorrorshow is right, friend. a real show of horrors.â€ and then i had like a cap stuck on my gulliver and i could viddy all wires running away from it, and they stuck a like suction pad on my belly and one on the old tick-tocker, and i could just about viddy wires running away from those. then there was the shoom of a door opening and you could tell some very important chelloveck was coming in by the way the white-coated under-vecks went all stiff. and then i viddied this dr. brodsky. he was a malenky veck, very fat, with all curly hair curling all over his gulliver, and on his spuddy nose he had very thick ochkies. i could just viddy that he had a real horrorshow suit on, absolutely the heighth of fashion, and he had a like very delicate and subtle von of operating-theatres coming from him. with him was dr. branom, all smiling like as though to give me confidence. â€œeverything ready?â€ said dr. brodsky in a very breathy goloss. then i could slooshy voices saying right ri

 they call cutting or editing or some such veshch. for it was very real. and when it came to the sixth or seventh malchick leering and smecking and then going into it and the devotchka creeching on the sound-track like bezoomny, then i began to feel sick. i had like pains all over and felt i could sick up and at the same time not sick up, and i began to feel like in distress, o my brothers, being fixed rigid too on this chair. when this bit of film was over i could slooshy the goloss of this dr. brodsky from over by the switchboard saying: â€œreaction about twelve point five? promising, promising.â€

then we shot straight into another lomtick of film, and this time it was of just a human litso, a very like pale human face held still and having different nasty veshches done to it. i was sweating a malenky bit with the pain in my guts and a horrible thirst and my gulliver going throb throb throb, and it seemed to me that if i could not viddy this bit of film i would perhaps be not so sick. bu

 viddying what was being done and hearing the most ghastly creechings coming from this litso. i knew it could not really be real, but that made no difference. i was heaving away but could not sick, viddying first a britva cut out an eye, then slice down the cheek, then go rip rip rip all over, while red krovvy shot on to the camera lens. then all the teeth were like wrenched out with a pair of pliers, and the creeching and the blood were terrific. then i slooshied this very pleased goloss of dr. brodsky going: â€œexcellent, excellent, excellent.â€

the next lomtick of film was of an old woman who kept a shop being kicked about amid very gromky laughter by a lot of malchicks, and these malchicks broke up the shop and then set fire to it. you could viddy this poor starry ptitsa trying to crawl out of the flames, screaming and creeching, but having had her leg broke by these malchicks kicking her she could not move. so then all the flames went roaring round her, and you could viddy her agonize

d litso like appealing through the flames and the disappearing in the flames, and then you could slooshy the most gromky and agonized and agonizing screams that ever came from a human goloss. so this time i knew i had to sick up, so i creeched:

â€œi want to be sick. please let me be sick. please bring something for me to be sick into.â€ but this dr. brodsky called back:

â€œimagination only. youâ€™ve nothing to worry about. next film coming up.â€ that was perhaps meant to be a joke, for i heard a like smeck coming from the dark. and then i was forced to viddy a most nasty film about japanese torture. it was the 1939â€“45 war, and there were soldiers being fixed to trees with nails and having fires lit under them and having their yarbles cut off, and you even viddied a gulliver being sliced off a soldier with a sword, and then with his head roll

ing about and the rot and glazzies looking alive still, the plott of this soldier actually ran about, krovvying like a fountain out of the neck, and then it dropped, and all the time there was very very loud laughter from the japanese. the pains i felt now in my belly and the headache and the thirst were terrible, and they all seemed to be coming out of the screen. so i creeched:

â€œstop the film! please, please stop it! i canâ€™t stand any more.â€ and then the goloss of this dr. brodsky said:

â€œstop it? stop it, did you say? why, weâ€™ve hardly started.â€ and he and the others smecked quite loud.

i do not wish to describe, brothers, what other horrible veshches i was like forced to viddy that afternoon. the like minds of this dr. brodsky and dr. branom and the others in white coats, and remember there was this devotchka twiddling with the knobs and watching the meters, they must have been more cally and filthy than any prestoopnick in the staja itself. because

 i did not think it was possible for any veck to even think of making films of what i was forced to viddy, all tied to this chair and my glazzies made to be wide open. all i could do was to creech very gromky for them to turn it off, turn it off, and that like part drowned the noise of dratsing and fillying and also the music that went with it all. you can imagine it was like a terrible relief when iâ€™d viddied the last bit of film, and this dr. brodsky said, in a very yawny and bored like goloss: â€œi think that should be enough for day one, donâ€™t you, branom?â€ and there i was with the lights switched on, my gulliver throbbing like a bolshy big engine that makes pain, and my rot all dry and cally inside, and feeling i could like sick up every bit of pishcha i had ever eaten, o my brothers, since the day i was like weaned. â€œall right,â€ said this dr. brodsky, â€œhe can be taken back to his bed.â€ then he like patted me on the pletcho a

at that like horrible nightmare was in the past and all over. and then dr. branom came in, all nice and smiling. he said:

â€œwell, by my calculations you should be starting to feel all right again. yes?â€

â€œsir,â€ i said, like wary. i did not quite kopat what he was getting at govoreeting about calculations, seeing that getting better from feeling bolnoy is like your own affair and nothing to do with calculations. he sat down, all nice and droogy, on the bedâ€™s edge and said:

â€œdr. brodsky is pleased with you. you had a very positive response. tomorrow, of course, thereâ€™ll be two sessions, morning and afternoon, and i should imagine that youâ€™ll be feeling a bit limp at the end of the day. but we have to be hard on you, you have to be cured.â€ i said:

â€œyou mean i have to sit throughâ€”? you mean i have to look atâ€”? oh, no,â€ i said. â€œit was horrible.â€

â€œof course it was horrible,â€ smiled dr. branom. â€œviolence is a very horrible thing. thatâ€™s what youâ€™r

ody is learning it.â€

â€œbut,â€ i said, â€œi donâ€™t understand. i donâ€™t understand about feeling sick like i did. i never used to feel sick before. i used to feel like very the opposite. i mean, doing it or watching it i used to feel real horrorshow. i just donâ€™t understand why or how or whatâ€”â€

â€œlife is a very wonderful thing,â€ said dr. branom in a like very holy goloss. â€œthe processes of life, the make-up of the human organism, who can fully understand these miracles? dr. brodsky is, of course, a remarkable man. what is happening to you now is what should happen to any normal healthy human organism contemplating the actions of the forces of evil, the workings of the principle of destruction. you are being made sane, you are being made healthy.â€

â€œthat i will not have,â€ i said, â€œnor can understand at all. what youâ€™ve been doing is to make me feel very ill.â€

â€œdo you feel ill now?â€ he said, still with the old droogy smile on his litso. â€œdrinking tea,

â€œfirst-class,â€ creeched out this dr. brodsky. â€œyouâ€™re doing really well. just one more and then weâ€™re finished.â€

what it was now was the starry 1939â€“45 war again, and it was a very blobby and liny and crackly film you could viddy had been made by the germans. it opened with german eagles and the nazi flag with that like crooked cross that all malchicks at school love to draw, and then there were very haughty and nadmenny like german officers walking through streets that were all dust and bomb-holes and broken buildings. then

led and boomed on the sound-track, and it was ludwig van, the last movement of the fifth symphony, and i creeched like bezoomny at that. â€œstop!â€ i creeched. â€œstop, you grahzny disgusting sods. itâ€™s a sin, thatâ€™s what it is, a filthy unforgivable sin, you bratchnies!â€ they didnâ€™t stop right away, because there was only a minute or two more to goâ€”lewdies being beaten up and all krovvy, then more firing squads, then the old nazi flag and the end. but when the lights came on this dr. brodsky and also dr. branom were standing in front of me, and dr. brodsky said:

â€œwhatâ€™s all this about sin, eh?â€

â€œthat,â€ i said, very sick. â€œusing ludwig van like that. he did no harm to anyone. beethoven just wrote music.â€ and then i was really sick and they had to bring a bowl that was in the shape of like a kidney.

â€œmusic,â€ said dr. brodsky, like musing. â€œso youâ€™re keen on music. i know nothing about it myself. itâ€™s a useful emotional heightener, thatâ€™s all i know.

 well, well. what do you think about that, eh, branom?â€

â€œit canâ€™t be helped,â€ said dr. branom. â€œeach man kills the thing he loves, as the poet-prisoner said. hereâ€™s the punishment element, perhaps. the governor ought to be pleased.â€

â€œgive me a drink,â€ i said, â€œfor bogâ€™s sake.â€

â€œloosen him,â€ ordered dr. brodsky. â€œfetch him a carafe of ice-cold water.â€ so then these under-vecks got to work and soon i was peeting gallons and gallons of water and it was like heaven, o my brothers. dr. brodsky said:

â€œyou seem a sufficiently intelligent young man. you seem, too, to be not without taste. youâ€™ve just got this violence thing, havenâ€™t you? violence and theft, theft being an aspect of violence.â€ i didnâ€™t govoreet a single slovo, brothers, i was still feeling sick, though getting a malenky bit b

etter now. but it had been a terrible day. â€œnow then,â€ said dr. brodsky, â€œhow do you think this is done? tell me, what do you think weâ€™re doing to you?â€

â€œyouâ€™re making me feel ill. iâ€™m ill when i look at those filthy pervert films of yours. but itâ€™s not really the films thatâ€™s doing it. but i feel that if youâ€™ll stop these films iâ€™ll stop feeling ill.â€

â€œright,â€ said dr. brodsky. â€œitâ€™s association, the oldest educational method in the world. and what really causes you to feel ill?â€

â€œthese grahzny sodding veshches that come out of my gulliver and my plott,â€ i said, â€œthatâ€™s what it is.â€

â€œquaint,â€ said dr. brodsky, like smiling, â€œthe dialect of the tribe. do you know anything of its provenance, branom?â€

â€œodd bits of old rhyming slang,â€ said dr. branom, who did not look quite so much like a friend any more. â€œa bit of gipsy talk, too.

but most of the roots are slav. propaganda. subliminal penetration.â€

â€œall right, all right, all right,â€ said dr. brodsky, like impatient and not interested any more. â€œwell,â€ he said to me, â€œit isnâ€™t the wires. itâ€™s nothing to do with whatâ€™s fastened to you. those are just for measuring your reactions. what is it, then?â€

i viddied then, of course, what a bezoomny shoot i was not to notice that it was the hypodermic shots in the rooker.

â€œoh,â€ i creeched, â€œoh, i viddy all now. a filthy cally vonny trick. an act of treachery, sod you, and you wonâ€™t do it again.â€

â€œiâ€™m glad youâ€™ve

â€œgrahzny bratchnies,â€ i said, like snivelling. then i said: â€œi donâ€™t mind about the ultra-violence and all that cal. i put up with that. but itâ€™s not fair on the music. itâ€™s not fair i shoul

they both looked a bit like thoughtful. then dr. brodsky said: â€œdelimitation is always difficult. the world is one, life is one. the sweetest and most heavenly of activities partake in some measure of violenceâ€”the act of love, for instance; music, for instance. you must take your chance, boy. the choice has been all yours.â€ i didnâ€™t understand all these slovos, but now i said:

â€œyou neednâ€™t take it any further, sir.â€ iâ€™d changed my tune a malenky bit in my cunning way. â€œyouâ€™ve proved to me that all this dratsing and ultra-violen

â€œyouâ€™re not cured yet. thereâ€™s still a lot to be done. only when your body reacts promptly and violently to violence, as to a snake, without further help from us, without medication, only thenâ€”â€ i said:

â€œbut, sir, sirs, i see that itâ€™s wrong. itâ€™s wrong because itâ€™s against like society, itâ€™s wrong because every veck on earth has the right to live and be happy without being beaten and tolchocked and knifed. iâ€™ve learned a lot, oh really i have.â€

less than a fortnight, o my brothers and friends, it was like an age. it was like from the beginning of the world to the end of it. to finish the fourteen years without remission in the staja would have been nothing to it. every day it was the same. when the devotchka with the hypodermic came round, though, four days after this govoreeting with dr. brodsky and dr. branom, i said: â€œoh, no you wonâ€™t,â€ and tolchocked her on the rooker, and the syringe went tinkle clatter on to the floor. that was like to viddy what they would do. what they did was to get four or five real bolshy white-coated bastards of under-vecks to hold me down on the bed, tolchocking me with grinny litsos close to mine, and then this nurse ptitsa said: â€œyou wicked naughty little devil, you,â€ while she jabbed my rooker with another syringe and squirted this stuff in rea

, it having perhaps been pushed up or folded to the sides like blinds or shutters. and where there had been just the noise of coughing kashl kashl kashl and like shadows of the lewdies was now a real audience, and in this audience there were litsos i knew. there was the staja governor and the holy man, the charlie or charles as he was called, and the chief chasso and this very important and well-dressed chelloveck who was the minister of the interior or inferior. all the rest i did not know. dr. brodsky and dr. branom were there, though not now white-coated, instead they were dressed as doctors would dress who were big enough to want to dress in the heighth of fashion. dr. branom just stood, but dr. brodsky stood and govoreeted in a like learned manner to all the lewdies assembled. when he viddied me coming in he said:

â€œaha. at this stage, gentlemen, we introduce the subject himself. he is, as you will percieve, fit and well nourished. he comes straight from a nightâ€™s sleep and a good b

ld not bring on the sickness and pain if i just gripped his ankles with my rookers tight round them and brought this grashzny bratchny down to the floor. so i did this and he got a real bolshy surprise, coming down crack amid loud laughter from the vonny audience. but viddying him on the floor i could feel the whole horrible feeling coming over me, so i gave him my rooker to lift him up skorry and up he came. then just as he was going to give me a real nasty and earnest tolchock on the litso dr. brodsky said:

â€œall right, that will do very well.â€ then this horrible veck sort of bowed and danced off like an actor while the lights came up on me blinking and with my rot square for howling. dr. brodsky said to the audience: â€œour subject is, you see, impelled towards the good by, paradoxically, being impelled towards evil. the intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. to counter these the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. any

 questions?â€

â€œchoice,â€ rumbled a rich deep goloss. i viddied it belonged to the prison charlie. â€œhe has no real choice, has he? self-interest, fear of physical pain, drove him to that grotesque act of self-abasement. its insincerity was clearly to be seen. he ceases to be a wrongdoer. he ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice.â€

â€œthese are subtleties,â€ like smiled dr. brodsky. â€œwe are not concerned with motive, with the higher ethics. we are concerned only with cutting down crimeâ€”â€

â€œand,â€ chipped in this bolshy well-dressed minister, â€œwith relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons.â€

â€œhear hear,â€ said somebody.

there was a lot of govoreeting and arguing then and i just stood there, brothers, like completely ignored by all these ignorant bratchnies, so i creeched out:

â€œme, me, me. how about me? where do i come into all this? am i

â€œoh, if only i could believe that.â€ and you could viddy the governor give him a look like meaning that he would not climb so high in like prison religion as he thought he would. then loud arguing started again, and then i could slooshy the slovo love being thrown around, the prison charles himself creeching as loud as any about perfect love casteth out fear and all that cal. and now dr. brodsky said, smiling all over his litso:

â€œi am glad, gentlemen, this question of love has been raised. now we shall see in action a manner of love that was thought to be dead with the middle ages.â€ and then the lights went down and the spotlights came on again, one on your poor and suffering friend and narrator, and into the other there like rolled or sidled the most lovely young devotchka you could ever hope in all your jeezny, o my brothers, to viddy. that is to say, she had real horrorshow g

and then i felt real shooty and dim, it having been like an act again, for this devotchka smiled and bowed to the audience and like danced off, the lights coming up to a bit of applause. and the glazzies of some of these starry vecks in the audience were like popping out at this young devotchka with dirty and like unholy desire, o my brothers.

â€œhe will be your true christian,â€ dr. brodsky was creeching out, â€œready to turn the other cheek, ready to be crucified rather than crucify, sick to the very heart at the thought even of killing a fly.â€ and that was right, brothers, because when he said that i thought of killing a fly and felt just that tiny bit sick, but i pushed the sickness and pain back by thinking of the fly being fed with bits of sugar and looked after like a bleeding pet and all that cal. â€œreclamation,â€ he creeched. â€œjoy before the angels of god.â€

perhaps, i thought, if i ittied off to the public biblio around the corner i might find some book on the best way of snuffing it with no pain. i thought of myself dead and how sorry everybody was going to be, pee and em and that cally vonny joe who was a like usurper, and also dr. brodsky and dr. branom and that inferior interior minister and every veck else. and the boastful vonny government too. so out i scatted into the winter, and it was afternoon now, near two oâ€™clock, as i could viddy from the bolshy center timepiece, so that me being in the land with the old moloko plus must have took like longer than i thought. i walked down marghanita boulevard and then turned into boothby avenue, then round the corner again, and there was the public biblio.

it was a starry cally s
