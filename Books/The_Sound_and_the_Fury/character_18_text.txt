more felt than heard, for a long time. like all the bells that ever rang still 
ringing in the long dying light-rays and jesus and saint francis talking 
about his sister. because if it were just to hell; if that were all of it. 
finished. if things just finished themselves. nobody else there but her and 
me. if we could just have done something so dreadful that they would have 
fled hell except us. i have committed incest i said father it was i it was 
not dalton ames    and when he put dalton ames. dalton ames. dalton 
ames. when he put the pistol in my hand i didn't. that's why i didn't. he 
would be there and she would and i would. dalton ames. dalton ames. 
dalton ames. if we could have just done something so dreadful and father 
said that's sad too people cannot do anything that dreadful they cannot do

ou. and i will look down and see my murmuring bones and the deep 

water like wind, like a roof of wind, and after a long time they cannot 
distinguish even bones upon the lonely and inviolate sand. until on the 
day when he says rise only the flat-iron would come floating up. it's not 
when you realise that nothing can help you--religion, pride, anything--it's 
when you realise that you dont need any aid. dalton ames. dalton ames. 
dalton ames. if i could have been his mother lying with open body lifted 
laughing, holding his father with my hand refraining, seeing, watching him 
die before he lived. one minute she was standing in the door  
     i went to the dresser and took up the watch, with the face still down. i 
tapped the crystal on the corner of the dresser and caught the fragments of 
glass in my hand and put them into the ashtray and twisted the hands off 
and put them in the tray. the watch ticked on. i turned the face up,

the lodge-keeper's daughter. which was quite probable, whether she 
invented it or not. spoade was the world's champion sitter-around, no 
holds barred and gouging discretionary.   
     the shell was a speck now, the oars catching the sun in spaced glints, as 
if the hull were winking itself along him along. did you ever have a sister, 
no but they're all bitches. did you ever have a sister? one minute she was.

ames. dalton shirts. i thought all the time they were khaki, army issue 
khaki, until i saw they were of heavy chinese silk or finest flannel because 
they made his face so brown his eyes so blue. dalton ames. it just missed

rurban station. there 
was a car ready to leave, and i found a seat next the window and it started 
and i watched it sort of frazzle out into slack tide flats, and then trees. now 
and then i saw the river and i thought how nice it would be for them down 
at new london if the weather and gerald's shell going solemnly up the 
glinting forenoon and i wondered what the old woman would be wanting 
now, sending me a note before ten oclock in the morning. what picture of 
gerald i to be one of the    dalton ames    oh asbestos quentin has shot    
background. something with girls in it. women do have    always his voice 
above the gabble voice that breathed    an affinity for evil, for believing 
that no woman is to be trusted, but that some men are too innocent to 
protect themselves. plain girls. remote cousins and family friends whom

she took my hand and held it flat against her throat   

now say his name   
dalton ames   
i felt the first surge of blood there it surged in strong accelerating beats   
say it again   
her face looked off into the trees where the sun slanted and where the bird   
say it again   
dalton ames   
her blood surged steadily beating and beating against my hand   
      it dept on running for a long time, but my face felt cold and sort of 
dead, and my eye, and the cut place on my finger was smarting again. i 
could hear shreve working the pump, then he came back with the basin
