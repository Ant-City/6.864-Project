  3 newes laddes: our warres are done:
the desperate tempest hath so bang'd the turkes,
that their designement halts. a noble ship of venice,
hath seene a greeuous wracke and sufferance
on most part of their fleet

   mon. how? is this true?
  3 the ship is heere put in: a verennessa, michael cassio
lieutenant to the warlike moore, othello,
is come on shore: the moore himselfe at sea,
and is in full commission heere for cyprus

   mon. i am glad on't:
'tis a worthy gouernour

   3 but this same cassio, though he speake of comfort,
touching the turkish losse, yet he lookes sadly,
and praye the moore be safe; for they were parted
with fowle and violent tempest

hath leap'd into my seate. the thought whereof,
doth (like a poysonous minerall) gnaw my inwardes:
and nothing can, or shall content my soule
till i am eeuen'd with him, wife, for wife.
or fayling so, yet that i put the moore,
at least into a ielouzie so strong
that iudgement cannot cure. which thing to do,
if this poore trash of venice, whom i trace
for his quicke hunting, stand the putting on,
ile haue our michael cassio on the hip,
abuse him to the moore, in the right garbe
(for i feare cassio with my night-cape too)
make the moore thanke me, loue me, and reward me,
for making him egregiously an asse,
and practising vpon his peace, and quiet,
euen to madnesse. 'tis heere: but yet confus'd,
knaueries plaine face, is neuer seene, till vs'd.

   des. why then to morrow night, on tuesday morne,
on tuesday noone, or night; on wensday morne.
i prythee name the time, but let it not
exceed three dayes. infaith hee's penitent:
and yet his trespasse, in our common reason
(saue that they say the warres must make example)
out of her best, is not almost a fault
t' encurre a priuate checke. when shall he come?
tell me othello. i wonder in my soule
what you would aske me, that i should deny,
or stand so mam'ring on? what? michael cassio,
that came a woing with you? and so many a time
(when i haue spoke of you dispraisingly)
hath tane your part, to haue so much to do
to bring him in? trust me, i could do much

   oth. prythee no more: let him come when he will:
i will deny thee nothing

   des. why, this is not a boone:
'tis as i should entreate you weare your gloues,
or feede on nourishing dishes, or keepe you warme,
or sue to you, to do a peculiar profit
to your owne person. nay, when i haue a suite
wherein i me

whereon, i do beseech thee, grant me this,
to leaue me but a little to my selfe

   des. shall i deny you? no: farewell my lord

   des. aemilia come; be as your fancies teach you:
what ere you be, i am obedient.

  oth. excellent wretch: perdition catch my soule
but i do loue thee: and when i loue thee not,
chaos is come againe

   iago. my noble lord

   oth. what dost thou say, iago?
  iago. did michael cassio
when he woo'd my lady, know of your loue?
  oth. he did, from first to last:
why dost thou aske?
  iago. but for a satisfaction of my thought,
no further harme

   oth. why of thy thought, iago?
  iago. i did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir

hy braine
some horrible conceite. if thou do'st loue me,
shew me thy thought

   iago. my lord, you know i loue you

   oth. i thinke thou do'st:
and for i know thou'rt full of loue, and honestie,
and weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath,
therefore these stops of thine, fright me the more:
for such things in a false disloyall knaue
are trickes of custome: but in a man that's iust,
they're close dilations, working from the heart,
that passion cannot rule

   iago. for michael cassio,
i dare be sworne, i thinke that he is honest

   oth. i thinke so too

   iago. men should be what they seeme,
or those that be not, would they might seeme none

   oth. certaine, men should be what they seeme

   iago. why then i thinke cassio's an honest man

   oth. nay, yet there's more in this?
i prythee speake to me, as to thy thinkings,
as thou dost ruminate, and giue thy worst of thoughts
the worst of words

though i am bound to euery
