the counsel for and against. among the lookers-on there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority
of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,
when the judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
heresy about george washington.

mr. attorney-general now signified to my lord, that he deemed it
necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young ladyâ€™s
father, doctor manette. who was called accordingly.

â€œdoctor manette, look upon the prisoner. have you ever seen him before?â€

â€œonce. when he called at my lodgings in london. some three years, or
three years and a half ago.â€

â€œcan you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or
speak to his conversation with your daughter?â€

â€œsir, i can do neither.â€

â€œis there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
either?â€

â€œwere you newly released on the occasion in question?â€

â€œthey tell me so.â€

â€œhave you no remembrance of the occasion?â€

â€œnone. my mind is a blank, from some time--i cannot even say what

until he was clear of the old bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out
with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz

search of other carrion.




iv. congratulatory


from the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
doctor manette, lucie manette, his daughter, mr. lorry, the solicitor
for the defence, and its counsel, mr. stryver, stood gathered round mr.
charles darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from
death.

it would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
in doctor manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
shoemaker of the garret in paris. yet, no one could have looked at him
twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
had not

and you ought to know. you are a man of business, too.â€

â€œand as such,â€ quoth mr. lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had
now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered
him out of it--â€œas such i will appeal to doctor manette, to break up
this conference and order us all to our homes. miss lucie looks ill, mr.
darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.â€

do yet. speak for yourself.â€

â€œi speak for myself,â€ answered mr. lorry, â€œand for mr. darnay, and for

the quiet lodgings of doctor manette were in a quiet street-corner not
far from soho-square. on the afternoon of a certain fine sunday when the
waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried
it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, mr. jarvis
lorry walked along the sunny streets from clerkenwell where he lived,
on his way to dine with the doctor. after several relapses into
business-absorption, mr. lorry had become the doctorâ€™s friend, and the

thump from the golden giant. these, however, were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind
the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way
from sunday morning unto saturday night.

doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and
its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.
his scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and
he earned as much as he wanted.

these things were within mr. jarvis lorryâ€™s knowledge, thoughts, and
notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,

â€œ_i_ began it, miss pross?â€

â€œdidnâ€™t you? who brought her father to life?â€

â€œoh! if _that_ was beginning it--â€ said mr. lorry.

â€œit wasnâ€™t ending it, i suppose? i say, when you began it, it was hard
enough; not that i have any fault to find with doctor manette, except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
circumstances. but it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him (i could have forgiven
him), to take ladybirdâ€™s affections away from me.â€

mr. lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by
this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those

short with:

â€œnever imagine anything. have no imagination at all.â€

â€œi stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,
sometimes?â€

â€œnow and then,â€ said miss pross.

â€œdo you suppose,â€ mr. lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his
bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, â€œthat doctor manette has any
theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
oppressor?â€

â€œi donâ€™t suppose anything about it but what ladybird tells me.â€

â€œand that is--?â€

â€œthat she thinks he has.â€

knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never
feel certain of not losing himself again. that alone wouldnâ€™t make the
subject pleasant, i should think.â€

it was a profounder remark than mr. lorry had looked for. â€œtrue,â€ said
he, â€œand fearful to reflect upon. yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, miss
pross, whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression

the special benefit of mr. lorry. she had installed herself, some
time before, as mr. lorryâ€™s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the
plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. mysterious backs
and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
whispered to them in its own way above their heads.

still, the hundreds of people did not present themselves. mr. darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
was only one.

doctor manette received him kindly, and so did lucie. but, miss pross
suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and
retired into the house. she was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, â€œa fit of the
jerks.â€

the doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. the
resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times, and as
they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting

he had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
vivacity. â€œpray, doctor manette,â€ said mr. darnay, as they sat under the
plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
which happened to be the old buildings of london--â€œhave you seen much of
the tower?â€

â€œlucie and i have been there; but only casually. we have seen enough of
it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.â€

though reddening a little angrily, â€œin another character, and not in a

way beyond the heaving water and the long,
long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so
much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.

that he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. it was again a
summer day when, lately arrived in london from his college occupation,
he turned into the quiet corner in soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to doctor manette. it was the close of the summer
day, and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross.

he found the doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. the energy
which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. he was now a
very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
of resolution, and vigour of action. in his recovered energy he was
sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in

both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.â€

â€œi am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,â€ he answered,
a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the doctor. â€œmiss
manette--â€

â€œis well,â€ said the doctor, as he stopped short, â€œand your return will
delight us all. she has gone out on some household matters, but will
soon be home.â€

â€œdoctor manette, i knew she was from home. i took the opportunity of her
being from home, to beg to speak to you.â€

there was a blank silence.

â€œyes?â€ said the doctor, with evident constraint. â€œbring your chair here,
and speak on.â€

he complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less
easy.

â€œi have had the happiness, doctor manette, of being so intimate here,â€
 so he at length began, â€œfor some year and a half, that i hope the topic
on which i am about to touch ma

his constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it
originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that charles

another blank.

â€œyes, go on.â€

â€œyou anticipate what i would say, though you cannot know how earnestly
i say it, how earnestly i feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and
the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
laden. dear doctor manette, i love your daughter fondly, dearly,
disinterestedly, devotedly. if ever there were love in the world, i love
her. you have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!â€

the doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the
ground. at the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,
and cried:

â€œnot that, sir! let that be! i adjure you, do not recall that!â€

his cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in charles

he offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.

â€œi know,â€ said darnay, respectfully, â€œhow can i fail to know, doctor
manette, i who have seen you together from day to day, that between
you and miss manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so
belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it
can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
child. i know, doctor manette--how can i fail to know--that, mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there
is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
itself. i know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her. i know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her fro

have known this, night and day, since i have known you in your home.â€

her father sat silent, with his face bent down. his breathing was a
little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.

â€œdear doctor manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you
with this hallowed light about you, i have forborne, and forborne, as
long as it was in the nature of man to do it. i have felt, and do even
now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself. but i love her.

he laid his own upon it as he spoke.

â€œno, dear doctor manette. like you, a voluntary exile from france; like
you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like
you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
in a happier future; i look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. not to divide
with lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to
come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.â€

understand that, even if miss manette held me at this moment in her
innocent heart--do not think i have the presumption to assume so much--i
could retain no place in it against her love for her father.â€

â€œif that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?â€

â€œi understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitorâ€™s
favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. for which reason,
doctor manette,â€ said darnay, modestly but firmly, â€œi would not ask that
word, to save my life.â€

â€œi am sure of it. charles darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as
well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
delicate, and difficult to penetrate. my daughter lucie is, in this one
respect, such a mystery to me; i can make no guess at the state of her
heart.â€

supplied the rest.

so strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange
his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that darnay felt his own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.

â€œyou said something to me,â€ said doctor manette, breaking into a smile.
â€œwhat was it you said to me?â€

he was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a
condition. relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:

â€œyour confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
part. my present name, though but slightly changed from my motherâ€™s, is
not, as you will remember, my own. i wish to tell you what that is, and

if sydney carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the
house of doctor manette. he had been there often, during a whole year,
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. when he
cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
pierced by the light within him.

and yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,
and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. many a night
he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought

â€œhah!â€ muttered defarge.

â€œthe pleasure of conversing with you, monsieur defarge, recalls to me,â€
 pursued the spy, â€œthat i have the honour of cherishing some interesting
associations with your name.â€

â€œindeed!â€ said defarge, with much indifference.

â€œyes, indeed. when doctor manette was released, you, his old domestic,
had the charge of him, i know. he was delivered to you. you see i am
informed of the circumstances?â€

â€œsuch is the fact, certainly,â€ said defarge. he had had it conveyed
to him, in an accidental touch of his wifeâ€™s elbow as she knitted and
warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.

heaven for having bestowed her on him. by-and-bye, they went into the
house.

there was no one bidden to the marriage but mr. lorry; there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross. the marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.

doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper. they were only
three at table, and miss pross made the third. he regretted that charles
was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.

so, the time came for him to bid lucie good night, and they separated.
but, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, lucie came
downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,
beforehand.

â€ he said, with a start. â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€

miss pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. â€œo me, o me! all is
lost!â€ cried she, wringing her hands. â€œwhat is to be told to ladybird?
he doesnâ€™t know me, and is making shoes!â€

mr. lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the
doctorâ€™s room. the bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent
down, and he was very busy.

â€œdoctor manette. my dear friend, doctor manette!â€

the doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he
were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.

he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the
throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old
haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. he worked
hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.

mr. lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed

 that it was a
shoe of the old size and shape. he took up another that was lying by
him, and asked what it was.

â€œa young ladyâ€™s walking shoe,â€ he muttered, without looking up. â€œit
ought to have been finished long ago. let it be.â€

â€œbut, doctor manette. look at me!â€

he obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in
his work.

â€œyou know me, my dear friend? think again. this is not your proper
occupation. think, dear friend!â€

nothing would induce him to speak more. he looked up, for an instant at
a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract
a word from him. he worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and
words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or o

he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. he abandoned that
attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
fallen, or was falling. he remained, therefore, in his seat near the
window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.

doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,
that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour
after mr. lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.
when he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, mr. lorry rose
and said to him:

â€œwill you go out?â€

he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,
looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:

â€œout?â€

â€œyes; for a walk with me. why

nd cleared away, and he and the
doctor were left together, mr. lorry said, feelingly:

â€œmy dear manette, i am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a
very curious case in which i am deeply interested; that is to say, it is
very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less
so.â€

glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the
doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. he had already glanced
at his hands more than once.

â€œdoctor manette,â€ said mr. lorry, touching him affectionately on the
arm, â€œthe case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. pray
give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,
for his daughterâ€™s--his daughterâ€™s, my dear manette.â€

shock--?â€

mr. lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.

ut at all? what can i do for my friend? no man ever can have been
more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than i am to serve mine,
if i knew how.

â€œbut i donâ€™t know how to originate, in such a case. if your sagacity,
knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, i might be
able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, i can do so little.
pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,
and teach me how to be a little more useful.â€

doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and
mr. lorry did not press him.

â€œi think it probable,â€ said the doctor, breaking silence with an effort,
â€œthat the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite
unforeseen by its subject.â€

â€œwas it dreaded by him?â€ mr. lorry ventured to ask.

â€œvery much.â€ he said it with an involuntary shudder.

mind, and how difficult--how almos

â€œwould he,â€ asked mr. lorry, â€œbe sensibly relieved if he could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on
him?â€

â€œi think so. but it is, as i have told you, next to impossible. i even
believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible.â€

â€œnow,â€ said mr. lorry, gently laying his hand on the doctorâ€™s arm again,
after a short silence on both sides, â€œto what would you refer this
attack?â€

â€œi believe,â€ returned doctor manette, â€œthat there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady. some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled, i think. it is probable that
there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations
would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a
particular occasion. he tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him less

â€œyou are sure that he is not under too great a strain?â€

â€œi think i am quite sure of it.â€

â€œmy dear manette, if he were overworked now--â€

â€œmy dear lorry, i doubt if that could easily be. there has been a
violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.â€

â€œexcuse me, as a persistent man of business. assuming for a moment,
that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this
disorder?â€

â€œi do not think so. i do not think,â€ said doctor manette with the
firmness of self-conviction, â€œthat anything but the one train of
association would renew it. i think that, henceforth, nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. after what has
happened, and after his recovery, i find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again. i trust, and i almost
believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.â€

â€œhe has always kept it by him,â€ said mr. lorry, with an anxious look at
his friend. â€œnow, would it not be better that he should let it go?â€

still, the doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the
ground.

â€œyou do not find it easy to advise me?â€ said mr. lorry. â€œi quite
understand it to be a nice question. and yet i think--â€ and there he
shook his head, and stopped.

â€œyou see,â€ said doctor manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,
â€œit is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings
of this poor manâ€™s mind. he once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved
his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more
practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental
torture; that he has never been able to be

y, and laying a soiled and unopened letter
before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to
whom it was addressed? the house laid the letter down so close to darnay
that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right
name. the address, turned into english, ran:

â€œvery pressing. to monsieur heretofore the marquis st. evremonde, of
france. confided to the cares of messrs. tellson and co., bankers,
london, england.â€

on the marriage morning, doctor manette had made it his one urgent and
express request to charles darnay, that the secret of this name should
be--unless he, the doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate
between them. nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no
suspicion of the fact; mr. lorry could have none.

â€œno,â€ said mr. lorry, in reply to the house; â€œi have referred it,
i think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this
gentleman is to be found.â€

ve no rights, evremonde,â€ was the stolid reply. the officer
wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,
sanded it, and handed it to defarge, with the words â€œin secret.â€

defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany
him. the prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended
them.

â€œis it you,â€ said defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the
guardhouse steps and turned into paris, â€œwho married the daughter of
doctor manette, once a prisoner in the bastille that is no more?â€

â€œyes,â€ replied darnay, looking at him with surprise.

â€œmy name is defarge, and i keep a wine-shop in the quarter saint
antoine. possibly you have heard of me.â€

â€œmy wife came to your house to reclaim her father? yes!â€

the word â€œwifeâ€ seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to defarge, to say
with sudden impatience, â€œin the name of that sharp female newly-born,
and called la guillotine, why did you come to france?â€

were there. they drew back from the window, and the doctor looked for
explanation in his friendâ€™s ashy face.

â€œthey are,â€ mr. lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at
the locked room, â€œmurdering the prisoners. if you are sure of what you
say; if you really have the power you think you have--as i believe you
have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to la force. it
may be too late, i donâ€™t know, but let it not be a minute later!â€

doctor manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,
and was in the courtyard when mr. lorry regained the blind.

his streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous
confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,
carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.
for a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and
the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then mr. lorry saw him,
surrounded by all, and in the midst of

e, who, with a keenly observant look at him,
addressed him by his name.

â€œyour servant,â€ said mr. lorry. â€œdo you know me?â€

he was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five
to fifty years of age. for answer he repeated, without any change of
emphasis, the words:

â€œdo you know me?â€

â€œi have seen you somewhere.â€

â€œperhaps at my wine-shop?â€

much interested and agitated, mr. lorry said: â€œyou come from doctor
manette?â€

â€œyes. i come from doctor manette.â€

â€œand what says he? what does he send me?â€

defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. it bore the
words in the doctorâ€™s writing:

    â€œcharles is safe, but i cannot safely leave this place yet.
     i have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
     from charles to his wife.  let the bearer see his wife.â€

it was dated from la force, within an hour.

â€œtut, tut!â€ said mr. lorry; â€œwhat is this despondency in the brave
little breast? a shadow indeed! no substance in it, lucie.â€

but the shadow of the manner of these defarges was dark upon himself,
for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.

doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence. so much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed from her, that
not until long afterwards, when france and she were far apart, did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all

darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been

a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded
to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court, and
examined. that, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible
to the doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. that,
the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held
inviolate in safe custody. that, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner
was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the
doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,
delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, a

r the first time the doctor
felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. for the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which
could break the prison door of his daughterâ€™s husband, and deliver him.
â€œit all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.
as my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, i will be
helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid
of heaven i will do it!â€ thus, doctor manette. and when jarvis lorry saw
the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a
clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.

greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with, would
have yielded before his persevering purpose. while he kept himself
in his place, as a physician, whose busin

 a man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at the barrier, but whom he directly
remembered as defarge. he noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed
in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to
himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. they seemed to
be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at
the jury, but at nothing else. under the president sat doctor manette,
in his usual quiet dress. as well as the prisoner could see, he and mr.
lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the tribunal, who
wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
carmagnole.

charles evremonde, called darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor
as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the republic, under the decree
which banished all emigrants on pain of death. it was nothing that the
decree bore date since his return to france. there he 
 
 ___________________________
 
 the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in
england, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france.

what proof had he of this?

he handed in the names of two witnesses; theophile gabelle, and
alexandre manette.

but he had married in england? the president reminded him.

true, but not an english woman.

a citizeness of france?

yes. by birth.

her name and family?

â€œlucie manette, only daughter of doctor manette, the good physician who
sits there.â€

this answer had a happy effect upon the audience. cries in exaltation
of the well-known good physician rent the hall. so capriciously were
the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as
if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.

on these few steps of his dangerous way, charles darnay had set his foot

siness imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out
of the tribunalâ€™s patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he
had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the juryâ€™s
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen evremonde,
called darnay.

doctor manette was next questioned. his high personal popularity,
and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he
proceeded, as he showed that the accused was his first friend on his
release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in
england, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the aristocrat
government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as
the foe of england and friend

 the republic, forasmuch as they had not
assisted it by word or deed. so quick was the tribunal to compensate
itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to
him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four
hours. the first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign
of death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, â€œlong live the
republic!â€

the five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,
for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gate, there was a great
crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
court--except two, for which he looked in vain. on his coming out, the
concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by
turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the
shore.

they put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had
taken either o

it was an ordinance of the republic one and indivisible of liberty,
equality, fraternity, or death, that on the door or doorpost of every
house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. mr.
jerry cruncherâ€™s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down
below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name
himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom doctor manette had
employed to add to the list the name of charles evremonde, called
darnay.

in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed. in the doctorâ€™s little household, as
in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
shops. to avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.

â€œfor gracious sake, donâ€™t talk about liberty; we have quite enough of
that,â€ said miss pross.

â€œi am glad you have so much of the englishman in you, though i wish you

â€œbut the question, doctor manette. is thereâ€--it was the good creatureâ€™s

with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--â€œis there any
prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?â€

the four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging
to him.

â€œtell me how and why am i again a prisoner?â€

â€œit is enough that you return straight to the conciergerie, and will

doctor manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he
stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it,
moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting
the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red
woollen shirt, said:

mr. lorryâ€™s business eye read in the speakerâ€™s face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point. confused, but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was
silently attentive.

â€œnow, i trust,â€ said sydney to him, â€œthat the name and influence of
doctor manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he

vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date--he knew that he had crossed the channel, and accepted service in
france: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. he
knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint
antoine and defargeâ€™s wine-shop; had received from the watchful police
such heads of information concerning doctor manetteâ€™s imprisonment,
release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to
familiar conversation with the defarges; and tried them on madame
defarge, and had broken down with them signally. he always remembered
with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he
talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.
he had since seen her, in the section of saint antoine, over and over
again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose

mr. lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise
where the good old man was gone. sydney carton drank nothing but a
little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh
himself, went out to the place of trial.

the court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell
away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.
mr. lorry was there, and doctor manette was there. she was there,
sitting beside her father.

when her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so
sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying
tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy
blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. if
there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on sydney

loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. the president rang his bell, and
with warmth resumed.

â€œif the republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. listen to what is
to follow. in the meanwhile, be silent!â€

frantic acclamations were again raised. doctor manette sat down, with
his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew
closer to him. the craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,
and restored the usual hand to his mouth.

defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his
being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of
his having been a mere boy in the doctorâ€™s service, and of the release,
and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him.
