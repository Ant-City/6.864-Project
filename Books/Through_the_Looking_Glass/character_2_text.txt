ge of the shovel--and here are two castles
walking arm in arm--i donâ€™t think they can hear me,â€™ she went on, as she
put her head closer down, â€˜and iâ€™m nearly sure they canâ€™t see me. i feel
somehow as if i were invisible--â€™

here something began squeaking on the table behind alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the white pawns roll over and
begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would
happen next.

â€˜it is the voice of my child!â€™ the white queen cried out as she rushed
past the king, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders.
â€˜my precious lily! my imperial kitten!â€™ and she began scrambling wildly
up the side of the fender.

â€˜imperial fiddlestick!â€™ said the king, rubbing his nose, which had been
hurt by the fall. he had a right to be a little annoyed with the queen,
for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.

alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little lily was
nearly screaming herself into

nd her heart began to beat quick
with excitement as she went on. â€˜itâ€™s a great huge game of chess thatâ€™s
being played--all over the world--if this is the world at all, you know.
oh, what fun it is! how i wish i was one of them! i wouldnâ€™t mind being
a pawn, if only i might join--though of course i should like to be a
queen, best.â€™

she glanced rather shyly at the real queen as she said this, but her
companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, â€˜thatâ€™s easily managed. you
can be the white queenâ€™s pawn, if you like, as lilyâ€™s too young to
play; and youâ€™re in the second square to begin with: when you get to
the eighth square youâ€™ll be a queen--â€™ just at this moment, somehow or
other, they began to run.

alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it
was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand
in hand, and the queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep
up with her: and still the queen kept crying â€˜faster! faste

o brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.

alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree.
â€˜it can never get at me here,â€™ she thought: â€˜itâ€™s far too large to
squeeze itself in among the trees. but i wish it wouldnâ€™t flap its wings
so--it makes quite a hurricane in the wood--hereâ€™s somebodyâ€™s shawl
being blown away!â€™




chapter v. wool and water

she caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in
another moment the white queen came running wildly through the wood,
with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and alice very
civilly went to meet her with the shawl.

â€˜iâ€™m very glad i happened to be in the way,â€™ alice said, as she helped
her to put on her shawl again.

the white queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way,
and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like
â€˜bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,â€™ and alice felt that if there was
to be any conversa

tion at all, she must manage it herself. so she began
rather timidly: â€˜am i addressing the white queen?â€™

â€˜well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,â€™ the queen said. â€˜it isnâ€™t my
notion of the thing, at all.â€™

alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very
beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, â€˜if your
majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, iâ€™ll do it as well as
i can.â€™

â€˜but i donâ€™t want it done at all!â€™ groaned the poor queen. â€˜iâ€™ve been
a-dressing myself for the last two hours.â€™

it would have been all the better, as i

d out â€˜ten minutes allowed for
refreshments!â€™ haigha and hatta set to work at once, carrying rough
trays of white and brown bread. alice took a piece to taste, but it was
very dry.

â€˜i donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll fight any more to-day,â€™ the king said to hatta:
â€˜go and order the drums to begin.â€™ and hatta went bounding away like a
grasshopper.

for a minute or two alice stood silent, watching him. suddenly she
brightened up. â€˜look, look!â€™ she cried, pointing eagerly. â€˜thereâ€™s the
white queen running across the country! she came flying out of the wood
over yonder--how fast those queens can run!â€™

â€˜thereâ€™s some enemy after her, no doubt,â€™ the king said, without even
looking round. â€˜that woodâ€™s full of them.â€™

â€˜but arenâ€™t you going to run and help her?â€™ alice asked, very much
surprised at his taking it so quietly.

â€˜no use, no use!â€™ said the king. â€˜she runs so fearfully quick. you might
as well try to catch a bandersnatch! but iâ€™ll make a memorandum about

to be dignified, you know!â€™

so she got up and walked about--rather stiffly just at first, as she was
afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the
thought that there was nobody to see her, â€˜and if i really am a queen,â€™
she said as she sat down again, â€˜i shall be able to manage it quite well
in time.â€™

everything was happening so oddly that she didnâ€™t feel a bit surprised
at finding the red queen and the white queen sitting close to her, one
on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came
there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. however, there would
be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. â€˜please, would
you tell me--â€™ she began, looking timidly at the red queen.

â€˜speak when youâ€™re spoken to!â€™ the queen sharply interrupted her.

â€˜but if everybody obeyed that rule,â€™ said alice, who was always ready
for a little argument, â€˜and if you only spok

he subject of the conversation. â€˜what do you mean by â€œif you
really are a queenâ€? what right have you to call yourself so? you canâ€™t
be a queen, you know, till youâ€™ve passed the proper examination. and the
sooner we begin it, the better.â€™

â€˜i only said â€œifâ€!â€™ poor alice pleaded in a piteous tone.

the two queens looked at each other, and the red queen remarked, with a
little shudder, â€˜she says she only said â€œifâ€--â€™

â€˜but she said a great deal more than that!â€™ the white queen moaned,
wringing her hands. â€˜oh, ever so much more than that!â€™

â€˜so you did, you know,â€™ the red queen said to alice. â€˜always speak the
truth--think before you speak--and write it down afterwards.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m sure i didnâ€™t mean--â€™ alice was beginning, but the red queen
interrupted her impatiently.

â€˜thatâ€™s just what i complain of! you should have meant! what do you
suppose is the use of child without any meaning? even a joke should
have some meaning--and a childâ€™s more impor

tant than a joke, i hope. you
couldnâ€™t deny that, even if you tried with both hands.â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t deny things with my hands,â€™ alice objected.

â€˜nobody said you did,â€™ said the red queen. â€˜i said you couldnâ€™t if you
tried.â€™

â€˜sheâ€™s in that state of mind,â€™ said the white queen, â€˜that she wants to
deny something--only she doesnâ€™t know what to deny!â€™

â€˜a nasty, vicious temper,â€™ the red queen remarked; and then there was an
uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.

the red queen broke the silence by saying to the white queen, â€˜i invite
you to aliceâ€™s dinner-party this afternoon.â€™

the white queen smiled feebly, and said â€˜and i invite you.â€™

â€˜i didnâ€™t know i was to have a party at all,â€™ said alice; â€˜but if there
is to be one, i think _i_ oug

ht to invite the guests.â€™

â€˜we gave you the opportunity of doing it,â€™ the red queen remarked: â€˜but
i daresay youâ€™ve not had many lessons in manners yet?â€™

â€˜manners are not taught in lessons,â€™ said alice. â€˜lessons teach you to
do sums, and things of that sort.â€™

â€˜and you do addition?â€™ the white queen asked. â€˜whatâ€™s one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t know,â€™ said alice. â€˜i lost count.â€™

â€˜she canâ€™t do addition,â€™ the red queen interrupted. â€˜can you do
subtraction? take nine from eight.â€™

â€˜nine from eight i canâ€™t, you know,â€™ alice replied very readily: â€˜but--â€™

â€˜she canâ€™t do subtraction,â€™ said the white queen. â€˜can you do division?
divide a loaf by a knife--whatâ€™s the answer to that?â€™

â€˜i suppo

€˜the dog would lose its temper,
wouldnâ€™t it?â€™

â€˜perhaps it would,â€™ alice replied cautiously.

â€˜then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!â€™ the queen
exclaimed triumphantly.

alice said, as gravely as she could, â€˜they might go different ways.â€™ but
she couldnâ€™t help thinking to herself, â€˜what dreadful nonsense we are
talking!â€™

â€˜she canâ€™t do sums a bit!â€™ the queens said together, with great
emphasis.

â€˜can you do sums?â€™ alice said, turning suddenly on the white queen, for
she didnâ€™t like being found fault with so much.

the queen gasped and shut her eyes. â€˜i can do addition, if you give me
time--but i canâ€™t do subtraction, under any circumstances!â€™

â€˜of course you know your a b c?â€™ said the red queen.

â€˜to be sure i do.â€™ said alice.

â€˜so do i,â€™ the white queen whispered: â€˜weâ€™ll often say it over together,
dear. and iâ€™ll tell you a secret--i can read words of one letter! isnâ€™t
that grand! however, donâ€™t be discouraged. youâ€™ll

come to it in time.â€™

here the red queen began again. â€˜can you answer useful questions?â€™ she
said. â€˜how is bread made?â€™

â€˜i know that!â€™ alice cried eagerly. â€˜you take some flour--â€™

â€˜where do you pick the flower?â€™ the white queen asked. â€˜in a garden, or
in the hedges?â€™

â€˜well, it isnâ€™t picked at all,â€™ alice explained: â€˜itâ€™s ground--â€™

â€˜how many acres of ground?â€™ said the white queen. â€˜you mustnâ€™t leave out
so many things.â€™

â€˜fan her head!â€™ the red queen anxiously interrupted. â€˜sheâ€™ll be feverish
after so much thinking.â€™ so they set to work and fanned her with bunches
of leaves, till she had to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about
so.

â€˜sheâ€™s all right again now,â€™ said the red queen. â€˜do you know languages?
whatâ€™s the french for fiddle-de-dee?â€™

â€˜fiddle-de-deeâ€™s not english,â€™ alice replied gravely.

â€˜who ever said it was?â€™ said

 the red queen.

alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. â€˜if youâ€™ll
tell me what language â€œfiddle-de-deeâ€ is, iâ€™ll tell you the french for
it!â€™ she exclaimed triumphantly.

but the red queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said â€˜queens never
make bargains.â€™

â€˜i wish queens never asked questions,â€™ alice thought to herself.

â€˜donâ€™t let us quarrel,â€™ the white queen said in an anxious tone. â€˜what
is the cause of lightning?â€™

â€˜the cause of lightning,â€™ alice said very decidedly, for she felt quite
certain about this, â€˜is the thunder--no, no!â€™ she hastily corrected
herself. â€˜i meant the other way.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s too late to correct it,â€™ said the red queen: â€˜when youâ€™ve once
said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.â€™

â€˜which reminds me--â€™ the white queen said, looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping he

gether--for warmth, you
know.â€™

â€˜are five nights warmer than one night, then?â€™ alice ventured to ask.

â€˜five times as warm, of course.â€™

â€˜but they should be five times as cold, by the same rule--â€™

â€˜just so!â€™ cried the red queen. â€˜five times as warm, and five times
as cold--just as iâ€™m five times as rich as you are, and five times as
clever!â€™

alice sighed and gave it up. â€˜itâ€™s exactly like a riddle with no
answer!â€™ she thought.

â€˜humpty dumpty saw it too,â€™ the white queen went on in a low voice, more
as if she were talking to herself. â€˜he came to the door with a corkscrew
in his hand--â€™

â€˜what did he want?â€™ said the red queen.

â€˜he said he would come in,â€™ the white queen went on, â€˜because he was
looking for a hippopotamus. now, as it happened, there wasnâ€™t such a
thing in the house, that morning.â€™

â€˜is there generally?â€™ alice asked in an astonished tone.

â€˜well, only on thursdays,â€™ said the queen.

â€˜i know what he came for,â€™ said al

here the white queen began again. â€˜it was such a thunderstorm, you canâ€™t
think!â€™ (â€˜she never could, you know,â€™ said the red queen.) â€˜and part of
the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in--and it went
rolling round the room in great lumps--and knocking over the tables and
things--till i was so frightened, i couldnâ€™t remember my own name!â€™

alice thought to herself, â€˜i never should try to remember my name in the
middle of an accident! where would be the use of it?â€™ but she did not
say thi

s aloud, for fear of hurting the poor queenâ€™s feeling.

â€˜your majesty must excuse her,â€™ the red queen said to alice, taking
one of the white queenâ€™s hands in her own, and gently stroking it:
â€˜she means well, but she canâ€™t help saying foolish things, as a general
rule.â€™

the white queen looked timidly at alice, who felt she ought to say
something kind, but really couldnâ€™t think of anything at the moment.

â€˜she never was really well brought up,â€™ the red queen went on: â€˜but
itâ€™s amazing how good-tempered she is! pat her on the head, and see how
pleased sheâ€™ll be!â€™ but this was more than alice had courage to do.

â€˜a little kindness--and putting her hair in papers--would do wonders
with her--â€™

the white queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on aliceâ€™s shou

her your nightcap--and sing her a soothing lullaby.â€™

â€˜i havenâ€™t got a nightcap with me,â€™ said alice, as she tried to obey the
first direction: â€˜and i donâ€™t know any soothing lullabies.â€™

â€˜i must do it myself, then,â€™ said the red queen, and she began:


   â€˜hush-a-by lady, in aliceâ€™s lap!
   till the feastâ€™s ready, weâ€™ve time for a nap:
   when the feastâ€™s over, weâ€™ll go to the ball--
   red queen, and white queen, and alice, and all!


â€˜and now you know the words,â€™ she added, as she put her head down on
aliceâ€™s other shoulder, â€˜just sing it through to me. iâ€™m getting sleepy,
too.â€™ in another moment both queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud.

â€˜what am i to do?â€™ exclaimed alice, looking about in great perplexity,
as first one round head, and then the other, rolled down from her
shoulder, and lay like a heavy lump in her lap. â€˜i donâ€™t think it ever
happened before, that any one had

€˜vexes it,
you know.â€™ then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his
great feet. â€˜you let it alone,â€™ he panted out, as he hobbled back to his
tree, â€˜and itâ€™ll let you alone, you know.â€™

at this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard
singing:


   â€˜to the looking-glass world it was alice that said,
   â€œiâ€™ve a sceptre in hand, iâ€™ve a crown on my head;
   let the looking-glass creatures, whatever they be,
   come and dine with the red queen, the white queen, and me.â€â€™


and hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:


  â€˜then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,
  and sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:
  put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea--
  and welcome queen alice with thirty-times-three!â€™


then followed a confused noise of cheering, and alice thought to
herself, â€˜thirty times three makes ninety. i wonder if any oneâ€™s
counting?â€™ in a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill
voice sang another verse;

  â€˜â€œo looking-glass creatures,â€ quoth alice, â€œdraw near!
  â€˜tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:
  â€˜tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea

then came the chorus again:--


  â€˜then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,
  or anything else that is pleasant to drink:
  mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine--
  and welcome queen alice with ninety-times-nine!â€™


â€˜ninety times nine!â€™ alice repeated in despair, â€˜oh, thatâ€™ll never
be done! iâ€™d better go in at once--â€™ and there was a dead silence the
moment she appeared.

alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large
hall,

 were fixed upon her; â€˜and
itâ€™s a very curious thing, i think--every poem was about fishes in some
way. do you know why theyâ€™re so fond of fishes, all about here?â€™

she spoke to the red queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark.
â€˜as to fishes,â€™ she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth
close to aliceâ€™s ear, â€˜her white majesty knows a lovely riddle--all in
poetry--all about fishes. shall she repeat it?â€™

â€˜her red majestyâ€™s very kind to mention it,â€™ the white queen murmured
into aliceâ€™s other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. â€˜it
would be such a treat! may i?â€™

â€˜please do,â€™ alice said very politely.

the white queen laughed with delight, and stroked aliceâ€™s cheek. then
she began:


    â€˜â€œfirst, the fish must be caught.â€
   that is easy: a baby, i think, could have caught it.
    â€œnext, the fish must be bought.â€
   that is easy: a penny, i think, would have bought it.

    â€œnow cook me the fish!â€
   that is easy, and wi

their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their
faces--others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off
the edges of the table--and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up
the gravy, â€˜just like pigs in a trough!â€™ thought alice.

â€˜you ought to return thanks in a neat speech,â€™ the red queen said,
frowning at alice as she spoke.

â€˜we must support you, you know,â€™ the white queen whispered, as alice got
up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened.

â€˜thank you very much,â€™ she whispered in reply, â€˜but i can do quite well
without.â€™

â€˜that wouldnâ€™t be at all the thing,â€™ the red queen said very decidedly:
so alice tried to submit to it with a good grace.

(â€˜and they did push so!â€™ she said afterwards, when she was telling her
sister the history of the feast. â€˜you would have thought they wanted to
squeeze me flat!â€™)

in fact it was rather diffic

ult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two queens pushed her so, one on each side, that
they nearly lifted her up into the air: â€˜i rise to return thanks--â€™
alice began: and she really did rise as she spoke, several inches; but
she got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down
again.

â€˜take care of yourself!â€™ screamed the white queen, seizing aliceâ€™s hair
with both her hands. â€˜somethingâ€™s going to happen!â€™

and then (as alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened
in a moment. the candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something
like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. as to the bottles, they
each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and
so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: â€˜and
very like birds they look,â€™ alice thought to herself,

as well as she
could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.

at this moment she heard a hoarse laugh at her side, and turned to see
what was the matter with the white queen; but, instead of the queen,
there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. â€˜here i am!â€™ cried a
voice from the soup tureen, and alice turned again, just in time to see
the queenâ€™s broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over
the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup.

there was not a moment to be lost. already several of the guests were
lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table
towards aliceâ€™s chair, and beckoning to her imp

 laugh.
â€˜and curtsey while youâ€™re thinking what to--what to purr. it saves time,
remember!â€™ and she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, â€˜just in
honour of having been a red queen.â€™

â€˜snowdrop, my pet!â€™ she went on, looking over her shoulder at the white
kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, â€˜when will
dinah have finished with your white majesty, i wonder? that must be the
reason you were so untidy in my dream--dinah! do you know that youâ€™re
scrubbing a white queen? really, itâ€™s most disrespectful of you!

â€˜and what did dinah turn to, i wonder?â€™ she prattled on, as she settled
comfortably down, with one elbow in the rug, and her chin in her hand,
to watch the kittens. â€˜tell me, dinah, did you turn to humpty dumpty? i
think you did--however, youâ€™d better not mention it to your friends just
yet, for iâ€™m not sure.

â€˜by the way, kitty, if only youâ€™d been really with me in my dream, there
was one thing you would have enjoyed--i had such a quant
