this fancy stuff that just enfeebles the will-power of the working man
and gives his kids a lot of notions above their class. and you--if you'd
tend to business instead of fooling and fussing--all the time! when i
was a young man i made up my mind what i wanted to do, and stuck to it
through thick and thin, and that's why i'm where i am to-day, and--myra!
what do you let the girl chop the toast up into these dinky little
chunks for? can't get your fist onto 'em. half cold, anyway!"

ted babbitt, junior in the great east side high school, had been making
hiccup-like sounds of interruption. he blurted now, "say, rone, you
going to--"

verona whirled. "ted! will you kindly not interrupt us when we're
talking about serious matters!"

"aw punk," said ted judicially. "ever since somebody slipped up and let
you out of college, ammonia, you been pulling these nut conversations
about what-nots and so-on-and-so-forths. are you going to--i want to use
the car tonight."

babbitt snorted, "oh, you

desired nothing more than complete safety in his investments, freedom
from attention to details, and the thirty or forty per cent. profit
which, according to all authorities, a pioneer deserves for his risks
and foresight. he was a stubby man with a cap-like mass of short gray
curls and clothes which, no matter how well cut, seemed shaggy. below
his eyes were semicircular hollows, as though silver dollars had been
pressed against them and had left an imprint.

particularly and always lyte consulted babbitt, and trusted in his slow
cautiousness.

six months ago babbitt had learned that one archibald purdy, a grocer
in the indecisive residential district known as linton, was talking of
opening a butcher shop beside his grocery. looking up the ownership of
adjoining parcels of land, babbitt found that purdy owned his present
shop but did not own the one available lot adjoining. he advised conrad
lyte to purchase this lot, for eleven thousand dollars, though an
appraisal on a basis of rents did not i

 hip-boots, on tents with
celluloid windows and folding chairs and ice-boxes. he simple-heartedly
wanted to buy all of them. it was the paul whom he was always vaguely
protecting who kept him from his drunken desires.

but even paul lightened when willis ijams, a salesman with poetry and
diplomacy, discussed flies. "now, of course, you boys know." he said,
"the great scrap is between dry flies and wet flies. personally, i'm for
dry flies. more sporting."

"that's so. lots more sporting," fulminated babbitt, who knew very
little about flies either wet or dry.

"now if you'll take my advice, georgie, you'll stock up well on these
pale evening dims, and silver sedges, and red ants. oh, boy, there's a
fly, that red ant!"

"you bet! that's what it is--a fly!" rejoiced babbitt.

"yes, sir, that red ant," said ijams, "is a real honest-to-god fly!"

"oh, i guess ole mr. trout won't come a-hustling when i drop one of
those red ants on the water!" asserted babbitt, and his thick wrists

cott, reporter on the advocate-times was appointed
press-agent of the chatham road presbyterian sunday school. he gave six
hours a week to it. at least he was paid for giving six hours a week.
he had friends on the press and the gazette and he was not (officially)
known as a press-agent. he procured a trickle of insinuating items
about neighborliness and the bible, about class-suppers, jolly but
educational, and the value of the prayer-life in attaining financial
success.

the sunday school adopted babbitt's system of military ranks. quickened
by this spiritual refreshment, it had a boom. it did not become the
largest school in zenith--the central methodist church kept ahead of it
by methods which dr. drew scored as "unfair, undignified, un-american,
ungentlemanly, and unchristian"--but it climbed from fourth place to
second, and there was rejoicing in heaven, or at least in that portion
of heaven included in the parsonage of dr. drew, while babbitt had much
praise and good repute.

) he was being
"rushed" by two fraternities. but of his studies babbitt could learn
nothing save a mumbled, "oh, gosh, these old stiffs of teachers just
give you a lot of junk about literature and economics."

one week-end ted proposed, "say, dad, why can't i transfer over from the
college to the school of engineering and take mechanical engineering?
you always holler that i never study, but honest, i would study there."

"no, the engineering school hasn't got the standing the college has,"
fretted babbitt.

"i'd like to know how it hasn't! the engineers can play on any of the
teams!"

there was much explanation of the "dollars-and-cents value of being
known as a college man when you go into the law," and a truly oratorical
account of the lawyer's life. before he was through with it, babbitt had
ted a united states senator.

among the great lawyers whom he mentioned was seneca doane.

"but, gee whiz," ted marveled, "i thought you always said this doane was
a reg'lar nut!"

dancing in a haze of
cigarette smoke. the tables and chairs were against the wall.

"oh, isn't this dandy!" she gabbled at him. "carrie nork had the
loveliest idea. she decided it was time for a party, and she 'phoned the
bunch and told 'em to gather round. . . . george, this is carrie."

"carrie" was, in the less desirable aspects of both, at once matronly
and spinsterish. she was perhaps forty; her hair was an unconvincing
ash-blond; and if her chest was flat, her hips were ponderous. she
greeted babbitt with a giggling "welcome to our little midst! tanis says
you're a real sport."

he was apparently expected to dance, to be boyish and gay with carrie,
and he did his unforgiving best. he towed her about the room, bumping
into other couples, into the radiator, into chair-legs cunningly
ambushed. as he danced he surveyed the rest of the bunch: a thin young
woman who looked capable, conceited, and sarcastic. another woman whom
he could never quite remember. three overdressed and slightly effeminat

p a little, just for a change?"

"well--what time they coming?"

he was at sam doppelbrau's at nine. it was the third time he had entered
the house. by ten he was calling mr. doppelbrau "sam, old hoss."

at eleven they all drove out to the old farm inn. babbitt sat in the
back of doppelbrau's car with louetta swanson. once he had timorously
tried to make love to her. now he did not try; he merely made love; and
louetta dropped her head on his shoulder, told him what a nagger eddie
was, and accepted babbitt as a decent and well-trained libertine.

with the assistance of tanis's bunch, the doppelbraus, and other
companions in forgetfulness, there was not an evening for two weeks when
he did not return home late and shaky. with his other faculties blurred
he yet had the motorist's gift of being able to drive when he could
scarce walk; of slowing down at corners and allowing for approaching
cars. he came wambling into the house. if verona and kenneth escott were
about, he got past them with a hasty g

of the finances,
ethnology, political systems, linguistic divisions, mineral resources,
and agriculture of germany, france, great britain, italy, austria,
czechoslovakia, jugoslavia, and bulgaria. he told them all about
those subjects, together with three funny stories about european
misconceptions of america and some spirited words on the necessity of
keeping ignorant foreigners out of america.

"say, that was a mighty informative talk. real he-stuff," said sidney
finkelstein.

but the disaffected babbitt grumbled, "four-flusher! bunch of hot
air! and what's the matter with the immigrants? gosh, they aren't
all ignorant, and i got a hunch we're all descended from immigrants
ourselves."

"oh, you make me tired!" said mr. finkelstein.

babbitt was aware that dr. a. i. dilling was sternly listening from
across the table. dr. dilling was one of the most important men in the
boosters'. he was not a physician but a surgeon, a more romantic and
sounding occupation. he was an intense large man with a bo

desk-chair and his voice had changed from
rasping efficiency to an unctuous familiarity with sin and with the
almighty. babbitt also knelt, while drew gloated:

"o lord, thou seest our brother here, who has been led astray by
manifold temptations. o heavenly father, make his heart to be pure,
as pure as a little child's. oh, let him know again the joy of a manly
courage to abstain from evil--"

sheldon smeeth came frolicking into the study. at the sight of the two
men he smirked, forgivingly patted babbitt on the shoulder, and
knelt beside him, his arm about him, while he authorized dr. drew's
imprecations with moans of "yes, lord! help our brother, lord!"

though he was trying to keep his eyes closed, babbitt squinted between
his fingers and saw the pastor glance at his watch as he concluded with
a triumphant, "and let him never be afraid to come to us for counsel and
tender care, and let him know that the church can lead him as a little
lamb."

dr. drew sprang up, rolled his eyes in the general
