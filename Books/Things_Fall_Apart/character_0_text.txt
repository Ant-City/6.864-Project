things fall apart




chapter one

okonkwo was well known throughout the nine villages and even
beyond. his fame rested on solid personal achievements. as a
young man of eighteen he had brought honor to his village by
throwing amalinze the cat. amalinze was the great wrestler who
for seven years was unbeaten, from umuofia to mbaino. he was
called the cat because his back would never touch the earth. it was
this man that okonkwo threw in a fight which the old men agreed
was one of the fiercest since the founder of their town engaged a
spirit of the wild for seven days and seven nights.

the drums beat and the flutes sang and the spectators held their
breath. amalinze was a wily craftsman, but okonkwo was as
slippery as a fish in water. every nerve and every muscle stood out
on their arms, on their backs and their thighs, and one almost heard
them stretching to breaking point. in the end okonkwo threw the
cat.

t was many years ago, twenty years or more, and during this
time okonkwo's fame had grown like a bush-fire in the harmattan.
he was tall and huge, and his bushy eyebrows and wide nose gave
him a very severe look. he breathed heavily, and it was said that,
when he slept, his wives and children in their houses could hear
him breathe. when he walked, his heels hardly touched the ground
and he seemed to walk on springs, as if he was going to pounce on
somebody. and he did pounce on people quite often. he had a
slight stammer and whenever he was angry and could not get h

thousand cowries. but he has not come to wake me up in the
morning for it. i shall pay you, but not today. our elders say that
the sun will shine on those who stand before it shines on those who
kneel under them. i shall pay my big debts first." and he took
another pinch of snuff, as if that was paying the big debts first.
okoye rolled his goatskin and departed.

  when unoka died he had taken no title at all and he was heavily
in debt. any wonder then that his son okonkwo was ashamed of
him? fortunately, among these people a man was judged according
to his worth and not according to the worth of his father. okonkwo
was clearly cut out for great things. he was still young but he had
won fame as the greatest wrestler in the nine villages. he was a
wealthy farmer and had two barns full of yams, and had just
married his third wife. to crown it all he had taken two titles and
had shown incredible prowess in two inter-tribal wars. and so
although okonkwo was still you

ng, he was already one of the
greatest men of his time. age was respected among his people, but
achievement was revered. as the elders said, if a child washed his
hands he could eat with kings. okonkwo had clearly washed his



hands and so he ate with kings and elders. and that was how he
came to look after the doomed lad who was sacrificed to the
village of umuofia by their neighbors to avoid war and bloodshed.
the ill-fated lad was called ikemefuna.



chapter two

okonkwo had just blown out the palm-oil lamp and stretched
himself on his bamboo bed when he heard the ogene of the town
crier piercing the still night air. gome, gome, gome, gome, boomed
the hollow metal. then the crier gave his message, and at the end
of it beat his instrument again. and this was the message. every
man of umuofia was asked to gather at the market place tomorrow
morning. okonkwo wondered what was amiss, for he knew
certainly that something was amiss. he had discerned a clear
overtone

s.

on a moonlight night it would be different. the happy voices of
children playing in open fields would then be heard. and perhaps
those not so young would be playing in pairs in less open places,
and old men and women would remember their youth. as the ibo
say: "when the moon is shining the cripple becomes hungry for a
walk."





but this particular night was dark and silent. and in all the nine
villages of umuofia a town crier with his ogene asked every man
to be present tomorrow morning. okonkwo on his bamboo bed
tried to figure out the nature of the emergency - war with a
neighboring clan? that seemed the most likely reason, and he was
not afraid of war. he was a man of action, a man of war. unlike his
father he could stand the look of blood. in umuofia's latest war he
was the first to bring home a human head. that was his fifth head
and he was not an old man yet. on great occasions such as the
funeral of a village celebrity he drank his palm-wine from his first
human head.

in the mo

t should
be recorded that it never went to war unless its case was clear and
just and was accepted as such by its oracle - the oracle of the hills
and the caves. and there were indeed occasions when the oracle
had forbidden umuofia to wage a war. if the clan had disobeyed
the oracle they would surely have been beaten, because their
dreaded agadi-nwayi would never fight what the ibo call a fight of
blame.

but the war that now threatened was a just war. even the enemy
clan knew that. and so when okonkwo of umuofia arrived at
mbaino as the proud and imperious emissary of war, he was




treated with great honor and respect, and two days later he returned
home with a lad of fifteen and a young virgin. the lad's name was
ikemefuna, whose sad story is still told in umuofia unto this day.

the elders, or ndichie, met to hear a report of okonkwo's mission.
at the end they decided, as everybody knew they would, that the
girl should go to ogbuefi udo to replace his murdered wife. as for
the boy, he b

elonged to the clan as a whole, and there was no hurry
to decide his fate. okonkwo was, therefore, asked on behalf of the
clan to look after him in the interim. and so for three years
ikemefuna lived in okonkwo's household.

qkonkwo ruled his household with a heavy hand. his wives,
especially the youngest, lived in perpetual fear of his fiery temper,
and so did his little children. perhaps down in his heart okonkwo
was not a cruel man. but his whole life was dominated by fear, the
fear of failure and of weakness. it was deeper and more intimate
than the fear of evil and capricious gods and of magic, the fear of
the forest, and of the forces of nature, malevolent, red in tooth and
claw. okonkwo's fear was greater than these. it was not external
but lay deep within himself. it was the fear of himself, lest he
should be found to resemble his father. even as a little boy he had
resented his father's failure a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd weakness, and even now he still
remembered how he had suffered when a playmate had told him
that his father was agbala. that was how okonkwo first came to
know that agbala was not only another name for a woman, it could
also mean a man who had taken no title. and so okonkwo was
ruled by one passion - to hate everything that his father unoka had
loved. one of those things was gentleness and another was idleness.

during the planting season okonkwo worked daily on his farms
from cock-crow until the chickens went to roost. he was a very
strong man and rarely felt fatigue. but his wives and young
children were not as strong, and so they suffered. but they dared
not complain openly. okonkwo's first son, nwoye, was then



twelve years old but was already causing his father great anxiety
for his incipient laziness. at any rate, that was how it looked to his
father, and he sought to correct him by constant nagging and
beating. and so nwoye wa

s developing into a sad-faced youth.



okonkwo's prosperity was visible in his household. he had a large
compound enclosed by a thick wall of red earth. his own hut, or
obi, stood immediately behind the only gate in the red walls. each
of his three wives had her own hut, which together formed a half
moon behind the obi. the barn was built against one end of the red
walls, and long stacks of yam stood out prosperously in it. at the
opposite end of the compound was a shed for the goats, and each
wife built a small attachment to her hut for th

e hens. near the barn
was a small house, the "medicine house" or shrine where okonkwo
kept the wooden symbols of his personal god and of his ancestral
spirits. he worshipped them with sacrifices of kola nut, food and
palm-wine, and offered prayers to them on behalf of himself, his
three wives and eight children.

so when the daughter of umuofia was killed in mbaino,
ikemefuna came into okonkwo's household. when okonkwo
brought him home that day he called his most senior wife and
handed him over to her.

"he belongs to the clan," he told her. "so look after him."

"is he staying long with us?" she asked.

"do what you are told, woman," okonkwo thundered, and
stammered. "when did you become one of the ndichie of
umuofia?"

and so nwoye's mother took ikemefuna to her hut and asked no
more questions.





as for the boy himself, he was terribly afraid. he could not
understand what was happening to him or what he
 
 ___________________________
 
know that his father had taken a hand in killing a daughter
of umuofia? all he knew was that a few men had arrived at their
house, conversing with his father in low tones, and at the end he
had been taken out and handed over to a stranger. his mother had
wept bitterly, but he had been too surprised to weep. and so the
stranger had brought him, and a girl, a long, long way from home,
through lonely forest paths. he did not know who the girl was, and
he never saw her again.





chapter three

   okonkwo did not have the start in life which many young men
usually had. he did not inherit a barn from his father. there was no
barn to inherit. the story was told in umuofia, of how his father,
unoka, had gone to consult the oracle of the hills and the caves to
find out why he always had a miserable harvest.

the oracle was called agbala, and people came from far and near
to consult it. they came when misfortune dogged their steps or
when they had a dispute with their neighbors. they came to
discover

eart of the
cave and proclaimed the will of the god. the fire did not burn with
a flame. the glowing logs only served to light up vaguely the dark
figure of the priestess.



sometimes a man came to consult the spirit of his dead father or
relative. it was said that when such a spirit appeared, the man saw
it vaguely in the darkness, but never heard its voice. some people
even said that they had heard the spirits flying and flapping their
wings against the roof of the cave.

many years ago when okonkwo was still a boy his father, unoka,
had gone to consult agbala. the priestess in those days was a
woman called chika. she was full of the power of her god, and she
was greatly feared. unoka stood before her and began his story.

"every year," he said sadly, "before 1 put any crop in the earth, i
sacrifice a cock to ani, the owner of all land. it is the law of our
fathers. i also kill a cock at the shrine of ifejioku, the god of yams.
i clear the bush and set fire to it when it is dry. i sow the

he house. he
was carried to the evil forest and left there to die. there was the
story of a very stubborn man who staggered back to his house and
had to be carried again to the forest and tied to a tree. the sickness
was an abomination to the earth, and so the victim could not be
buried in her bowels. he died and rotted away above the earth, and
was not given the first or the second burial. such was unoka's fate.
when they carried him away, he took with him his flute.

with a father like unoka, okonkwo did not have the start in life
which many young men had. he neither inherited a barn nor a title,
nor even a young wife. but in spite of these disadvantages, he had
begun even in his father's lifetime to lay the foundations of a
prosperous future. it was slow and painful. but he threw himself
into it like one possessed. and indeed he was possessed by the fear
of his father's contemptible life and shameful death.

there was a wealthy man in okonkwo's village who had three
huge barns, nine wives 
 
 ___________________________
 
and thirty children. his name was
nwakibie and he had taken the highest but one title which a man
could take in the clan. it was for this man that okonkwo worked to
earn his first seed yams.

he took a pot of palm-wine and a cock to nwakibie. two elderly
neighbors were sent for, and nwakibie's two grown-up sons were
also present in his obi. he presented a kola nut and an alligator
pepper, which were passed round for all to see and then returned to
him. he broke the nut saying: we shall all live. we pray for life,
children, a good harvest and happiness. you will have what is
good for you and i will have what is good for me. let the kite
perch and

let the eagle perch too. if one says no to the other, let his
wing break."



after the kola nut had been eaten okonkwo brought his palm-
wine from the corner of the hut where it had been placed and stood
it in the center of the group. he addressed nwakibie, calling him
"our father."



"nna ayi," he said. "1 have brought you this little kola. as our
people say, a man who pays respect to the great paves the way for
his own greatness. i have come to pay you my respects and also to
ask a favor. but let us drink the wine first."

everybody thanked okonkwo and the neighbors brought out their
drinking horns from the 
 
 ___________________________
 
goatskin bags they carried. nwakibie
brought down his own horn, which was fastened to the rafters. the
younger of his sons, who was also the youngest man in the group,
moved to the center, raised the pot on his left knee and began to
pour out the wine. the first cup went to okonkwo, who must taste
his wine before anyone else. then the group drank, beginning with
the eldest man. when everyone had drunk two or three horns,
nwakibie sent for his wives. some of them were not at home and
only four came in.

"is anasi not in?" he asked them. they said she was coming. anasi
was the first wife and the others could not drink before her, and so
they stood waiting.

anasi was a middle-aged woman, tall and strongly built. there was
authority in her bearing and she looked every inch t

me people say the oracle warned him that he would fall off a
palm tree and kill himself," said akukalia.

"obiako has always been a strange one," said nwakibie. "i have
heard that many years ago, when his father had not been dead very
long, he had gone to consult the oracle. the oracle said to him,
'your dead father wants you to sacrifice a goat to him.' do you
know what he told the oracle? he said,

'ask my dead father if he ever had a fowl when he was alive.'
everybody laughed heartily except okonkwo, who laughed
uneasily because, as the saying goes, an old woman is always
uneasy when dry bones are mentioned in a proverb. okonkwo
remembered his own father.

at last the young man who was pouring out the wine held up half a
horn of the thick, white dregs and said, "what we are eating is
finished."

"we have seen it," the others replied. "who will drink the dregs?"
he asked. "whoever has a job in hand," said idigo, looking at
nwakibie's elder son igwelo with a malicious twinkle in his eye.

ev
 
 ___________________________
 
erybody agreed that igwelo should drink the dregs. he accepted
the half-full horn from his brother and drank it. as idigo had said,
igwelo had a job in hand because he had married his first wife a
month or two before. the thick dregs of palm-wine were supposed
to be good for men who were going in to their wives.




after the wine had been drunk okonkwo laid his difficulties before
nwakibie.

"i have come to you for help," he said. "perhaps you can already
guess what it is. i have cleared a farm but have no yams to sow. i
know what it is to ask a man to trust another with his yams,
especially these days when young men are afraid of hard work. i
am not afraid of work. the lizard that jumped from the high iroko
tree to the ground said he would praise himself if no one else did. i
began to fend for myself at an age when most people still suck at

 
 ___________________________
 
cause i
knew they would just dump them in the earth and leave them to be
choked by weeds. when i say no to them they think i am hard
hearted. but it is not so. eneke the bird says that since men have
learned to shoot without missing, he has learned to fly without
perching. i have learned to be stingy with my yams. but i can trust
you. i know it as i look at you. as our fathers said, you can tell a
ripe corn by its look. i shall give you twice four hundred yams. go
ahead and prepare your farm."

okonkwo thanked him again and again and went home feeling
happy. he knew that nwakibie would not refuse him, but he had
not expected he would be so generous. he had not hoped to get
more than four hundred seeds. he would now have to make a
bigger farm. he hoped to get another four hundred yams from one
of his father's friends at isiuzo.

share-cropping was a very slow way of building up a barn of one's
own. after all the toil one only got a third of the harvest. but for a
young man whose father had no 
 
 ___________________________
 
yams, there was no other way.





and what made it worse in okonkwo's case was that he had to
support his mother and two sisters from his meagre harvest. and
supporting his mother also meant supporting his father. she could
not be expected to cook and eat while her husband starved. and so
at a very early age when he was striving desperately to build a barn
through share-cropping okonkwo was also fending for his father's
house. it was like pouring grains of corn into a bag full of holes.
his mother and sisters worked hard enough, but they grew
women's crops, like coco-yams, beans and cassava. yam, the king
of crops, was a man's crop.

the year that okonkwo took eight hundred seed-yams from
nwakibie was the worst year in living memory. nothing happened
at its proper time,- it was either too early or too late. it seemed as if
the world had gone mad. the first rains were late, and
 
 ___________________________
 
, when they
came, lasted only a brief moment. the blazing sun returned, more
fierce than it had ever been known, and scorched all the green that
had appeared with the rains. the earth burned like hot coals and
roasted all the yams that had been sown. like all good farmers,
okonkwo had begun to sow with the first rains. he had sown four
hundred seeds when the rains dried up and the heat returned. he
watched the sky all day for signs of rain clouds and lay awake all
night. in the morning he went back to his farm and saw the
withering tendrils. he had tried to protect them from the
smoldering earth by making rings of thick sisal leaves around them.
but by the end of the day the sisal rings were burned dry and gray.
he changed them every day, and prayed that the rain might f

all in
the night. but the drought continued for eight market weeks and
the yams were killed.

some farmers had not planted their yams yet. they were the lazy
easy-going ones who always put off clearing their farms as long as
they could. this year they were the wise ones. they sympathized
with their neighbors with much shaking of the head, but inwardly
they were happy for what they took to be their own foresight.



okonkwo planted what was left of his seed-yams when the rains
finally returned. he had one consolation. the yams he had sown
before the drought were his own, the harvest of the previous year.
he still had the eight hundred from nwakibie and the four hundred
from his father's friend. so he would make a fresh start.



but the year had gone mad. rain fell as it had never fallen before.
for days and nights together it poured down in violent torrents, and
washed away the yam heaps. trees were uprooted and 
 
 ___________________________
 
deep gorges
appeared everywhere. then the rain became less violent. but it
went from day to day without a pause. the spell of sunshine which
always came in the middle of the wet season did not appear. the
yams put on luxuriant green leaves, but every farmer knew that
without sunshine the tubers would not grow.

that year the harvest was sad, like a funeral, and many farmers
wept as they dug up the miserable and rotting yams. one man tied
his cloth to a tree branch and hanged himself.

okonkwo remembered that tragic year with a cold shiver
throughout the rest of his life. it always surprised him when he
thought of it later that he did not sink under the load of despair. he
knew that he was a fierce fighter, but that year-had been enough to
break the heart of a lion.

"since i survived that year," he always said, "i shall survive
anything." he put it down to his inflexible will.

his father, unoka, who was then an ailing man, had said to him
during that terrible harvest month: "do not
 
 ___________________________
 
 despair. 1 know you
will not despair. you have a manly and a proud heart. a proud
heart can survive a general failure because such failure does not
prick its pride. it is more difficult and more bitter when a man fails
alone."



unoka was like that in his last days. his love of talk had grown
with age and sickness. it tried okonkwo's patience beyond words.





chapter four



"looking at a king's mouth," said an old man, "one would think he
never sucked at his mother's breast." he was talking about
okonkwo, who had risen so suddenly from great poverty and
misfortune to be one of the lords of the clan. the old man bore no
ill will towards okonkwo. indeed he respected him for his industry
and success. but he was struck, as most people were, by
okonkwo's brusqueness in dealing with less successful men. only
a week ago a man
 
 ___________________________
 
 had contradicted him at a kindred meeting which
they held to discuss the next ancestral feast. without looking at the
man okonkwo had said: "this meeting is for men." the man who
had contradicted him had no titles. that was why he had called
him a woman. okonkwo knew how to kill a man's spirit.

everybody at the kindred meeting took sides with osugo when
okonkwo called him a woman. the oldest man present said sternly
that those whose palm-kernels were cracked for them by a
benevolent spirit should not forget to be humble. okonkwo said he
was sorry for what he had said, and the meeting continued.

but it was really not true that okonkwo's palm-kernels had been
cracked for him by a benevolent spirit. he had cracked them
himself. anyone who knew his grim struggle against poverty and
misfortune could not say he had been lucky. if ever a man
deserved his su
 
 ___________________________
 
ccess, that man was okonkwo. at an early age he
had achieved fame as the greatest wrestler in all the land. that was
not luck. at the most one could say that his chi or personal god
was good. but the ibo people have a proverb that when a man says





yes his chi says yes also. okonkwo said yes very strongly, so his
chi agreed. and not only his chi but his clan too, because it judged
a man by the work or his hands. that was why okonkwo had been
chosen by the nine villages to carry a message of war to their
enemies unless they agreed to give up a young man and a virgin to
atone for the murder of udo's wife. and such was the deep fear
that their enemies had for umuofia that they treated okonkwo like
a king and brought him a virgin who was given to udo as wife, and
the lad ikemefuna.

the elders of the clan had decided that ikemefuna should be in
okonkwo's care for a while. but no one thought it would be as
long as three years. 
 
 ___________________________
 
they seemed to forget all about him as soon as
they had taken the decision.

at first ikemefuna was very much afraid. once or twice he tried to
run away, but he did not know where to begin. he thought of his
mother and his three-year-old sister and wept bitterly. nwoye's
mother was very kind to him and treated him as one of her own
children. but all he said was: "when shall i go home?" when
okonkwo heard that he would not eat any food he came into the
hut with a big stick in his hand and stood over him while he
swallowed his yams, trembling. a few moments later he went
behind the hut and began to vomit painfully. nwoye's mother went
to him and placed her hands on his chest and on his back. he was
ill for three market weeks, and when he recovered he seemed to
have overcome his great fear and sadness.

he was by nature a very lively boy and he gradually became
popular in okonkwo's household
 
 ___________________________
 
, especially with the children.
okonkwo's son, nwoye, who was two years younger, became
quite inseparable from him because he seemed to know everything.
he could fashion out flutes from bamboo stems and even from the
elephant grass. he knew the names of all the birds and could set



clever traps for the little bush rodents. and he knew which trees
made the strongest bows.



even okonkwo himself became very fond of the boy - inwardly of
course. okonkwo never showed any emotion openly, unless it be
the emotion of anger. to show affection was a sign of weakness,-
the only thing worth demonstrating was strength. he therefore
treated ikemefuna as he treated everybody else - with a heavy hand.
but there was no doubt that he liked the boy. sometimes when he
went to big village meetings or communal ancestral feasts he
allowed ikemefuna to accompany him, like a son, carrying his
stool and his goatskin bag. and, indeed, ikemefuna called him
father.

i
 
 ___________________________
 
kemefuna came to umuofia at the end of the carefree season
between harvest and planting. in fact he recovered from his illness
only a few days before the week of peace began. and that was
also the year okonkwo broke the peace, and was punished, as was
the custom, by ezeani, the priest of the earth goddess.

okonkwo was provoked to justifiable anger by his youngest wife,
who went to plait her hair at her friend's house and did not return
early enough to cook the afternoon meal. okonkwo did not know
at first that she was not at home. after waiting in vain for her dish
he went to her hut to see what she was doing. there was nobody in
the hut and the fireplace was cold.

"where is ojiugo?" he asked his second wife, who came out of her
hut to draw water from a gigantic pot in the shade of a small tree in
the middle of the compound.

"she has gone to plait her hair."

okonkwo bit his lips as anger welled up within him.



"where are her children? did she take them?" he asked with
 
 ___________________________
 

unusual coolness and restraint.

"they are here," answered his first wife, nwoye's mother.
okonkwo bent down and looked into her hut. ojiugo's children
were eating with the children of his first wife.



"did she ask you to feed them before she went?"

"yes," lied nwoye's mother, trying to minimize ojiugo's
thoughtlessness.

okonkwo knew she was not speaking the truth. he walked back to
his obi to await ojiugo's return. and when she returned he beat her
very heavily. in his anger he had forgotten that it was the week of
peace. his first two wives ran out in great alarm pleading with him
that it was the sacred week.

but okonkwo was not the man to stop beating somebody half-way
through, not even for fear of a goddess.

okonkwo's neighbors heard his wife crying and sent their voices
over the compound walls to ask what was th
 
 ___________________________
 
e matter. some of
them came over to see for themselves. it was unheard of to beat
somebody during the sacred week.

before it was dusk ezeani, who was the priest of the earth goddess,
ani, called on okonkwo in his obi. okonkwo brought out kola nut
and placed it before the priest,

"take away your kola nut. i shall not eat in the house of a man
who has no respect for our gods and ancestors."

okonkwo tried to explain to him what his wife had done, but
ezeani seemed to pay no attention. he held a short staff in his hand
which he brought down on the floor to emphasize his points.




"listen to me," he said when okonkwo had spoken. "you are not a
stranger in umuofia. you know as well as i do that our forefathers
ordained that before we plant any crops in the earth we should
observe a week in which a man does not say a harsh word to his
neighbor. we live in peace with our fellows to honor our
 
 ___________________________
 
 at fault, but even if you came
into your obi and found her lover on top of her, you would still
have committed a great evil to beat her." his staff came down
again. "the evil you have done can ruin the whole clan. the earth
goddess whom you have insulted may refuse to give us her
increase, and we shall all perish." his tone now changed from
anger to command. "you will bring to the shrine of ani tomorrow
one she-goat, one hen, a length of cloth and a hundred cowries."
he rose and left the hut.

okonkwo did as the priest said. he also took with him a pot of
palm-wine. inwardly, he was repentant. but he was not the man to
go about telling his neighbors that he was in error. and so people
said he had no respect for the gods of the clan. his enemies said
his good fortune had gone to his head. they called him the little
bird nza who so far forgot himself after a heavy meal that he
challenged his chi.

no work was done during the week of peace. people called on
their neighbors and drank palm-wine. 
 
 ___________________________
 
this year they talked of
nothing else but the nso-ani which okonkwo had committed. it
was the first time for many years that a man had broken the sacred
peace. even the oldest men could only remember one or two other
occasions somewhere in the dim past.

ogbuefi ezeudu, who was the oldest man in the village, was telling
two other men who came to visit him that the punishment for
breaking the peace of ani had become very mild in their clan.




"it has not always been so," he said. "my father told me that he had
been told that in the past a man who broke the pe

 burial. and what is the result? their
clan is full of the evil spirits of these unburied dead, hungry to do
harm to the living."

after the week of peace every man and his family began to clear
the bush to make new farms. the cut bush was left to dry and fire
was then set to it. as the smoke rose into the sky kites appeared
from different directions and hovered over the burning field in
silent valediction. the rainy season was approaching when they
would go away until the dry season returned.

okonkwo spent the next few days preparing his seed-yams. he
looked at each yam carefully to see whether it was good for sowing.
sometimes he decided that a yam was too big to be sown as one
seed and he split it deftly along its length with his sharp knife. his
eldest son, nwoye, and ikemefuna helped him by fetching the
yams in long baskets from the barn and in counting the prepared
seeds in groups of four hundred. sometimes okonkwo gave them a
few yams each to prepare. but he always found fault with th

effort, and he said so with much threatening.



"do you think you are cutting up yams for cooking?" he asked
nwoye. "if you split another yam of this size, i shall break your
jaw. you think you are still a child. i began to own a farm at your
age. and you," he said to ikemefuna, "do you not grow yams
where you come from?"



inwardly okonkwo knew that the boys were still too young to
understand fully the difficult art of preparing seed-yams. but he
thought that one could not begin too early. yam stood for
manliness, and he who could feed his family on yams from one
harvest to another was a very great man indeed. okonkwo wanted
his son to be a great farmer and a great man. he would stamp out
the disquieting signs of laziness which he thought he already saw
in him.

"i will not have a son who cannot hold up his head in the gathering

 
 ___________________________
 
of the clan. i would sooner strangle him with my own hands. and
if you stand staring at me like that," he swore, "amadiora will
break your head for you!"

some days later, when the land had been moistened by two or
three heavy rains, okonkwo and his family went to the farm with
baskets of seed-yams, their hoes and machetes, and the planting
began. they made single mounds of earth in straight lines all over
the field and sowed the yams in them.

yam, the king of crops, was a very exacting king. for three or four
moons it demanded hard work and constant attention from cock-
crow till the chickens went back to roost. the young tendrils were
protected from earth-heat with rings of sisal leaves. as the rains
became heavier the women pla

uncertain whether the low rumbling of amadiora's thunder came
from above or below. at such times, in each of the countless
thatched huts of umuofia, children sat around their mother's
cooking fire telling stories, or with their father in his obi warming
themselves from a log fire, roasting and eating maize. it was a brief
resting period between the exacting and arduous planting season
and the equally exacting but light-hearted month of harvests.

ikemefuna had begun to feel like a member of okonkwo's family.
he still thought about his mother and his three-year-old sister, and
he had moments of sadness and depression but he and nwoye had
become so deeply attached to each other that such moments
became less frequent and less poignant. ikemefuna had an endless
stock of folk tales. even those which nwoye knew already were
told with a new freshness and the local flavor of a different clan.
nwoye remembered this period very vividly till the end of his life.
he even remembered how he had laughed

at was happening on the other, and it was not until
late in the evening that one of them saw for the first time his in-law
who had arrived during the course of the meal and had fallen to on
the opposite side. it was only then that they exchanged greetings
and shook hands over what was left of the food.

the new yam festival was thus an occasion for joy throughout
umuofia. and every man whose arm was strong, as the ibo people
say, was expected to invite large numbers of guests from far and
wide. okonkwo always asked his wives' relations, and since he
now had three wives his guests would make a fairly big crowd.

but somehow okonkwo could never become as enthusiastic over
feasts as most people. he was a good eater and he could drink one
or two fairly big gourds of palm-wine. but he was always
uncomfortable sitting around for days waiting for a feast or getting
over it. he would be very much happier working on his farm.

the festival was now only three days away. okonkwo's wives had
scrubbed the
 
 ___________________________
 
 backs. the children were also decorated, especially their
hair, which was shaved in beautiful patterns. the three women
talked excitedly about the relations who had been invited, and the
children reveled in the thought of being spoiled by these visitors
from the motherland. ikemefuna was equally excited. the new
yam festival seemed to him to be a much bigger event here than
in his own village, a place which was already becoming remote
and vague in his imagination.



and then the storm burst. okonkwo, who had been walking about
aimlessly in his compound in suppressed anger, suddenly found an
outlet.



"who killed this banana tree?" he asked.

a hush fell on the compound immediately.

"who killed this tree? or are you all deaf and dumb?"

as a matter of fact the tree was very much alive. okonkwo's
second wife had merely cut a few leaves off it to wrap some food,
and she said so. without further argument okonkwo gave her a
sound beating and left her and her only daughter weeping. neither
of 
 
 ___________________________
 
the other wives dared to interfere beyond an occasional and
tentative, "it is enough, okonkwo," pleaded from a reasonable
distance.

his anger thus satisfied, okonkwo decided to go out hunting. he
had an old rusty gun made by a clever blacksmith who had come to
live in umuofta long ago. but although okonkwo was a great man
whose prowess was universally acknowledged, he was not a hunter.
in fact he had not killed a rat with his gun. and so when he called
ikemefuna to fetch his gun, the wife who had just been beaten
murmured something about guns that never shot. unfortunately for
her okonkwo heard it and ran madly into his room for the loaded
gun, ran out again and aimed at her as she clambered over the
dwarf wall of the barn. he pressed the trigger and there was a loud
report accompanied by the wai

l of his wives and children. he
threw down the gun and jumped into the barn and there lay the
woman, very much shaken and frightened but quite unhurt. he
heaved a heavy sigh and went away with the gun.

in spite of this incident the new yam festival was celebrated with
great joy in okonkwo's household. early that morning as he
offered a sacrifice of new yam and palm oil to his ancestors he



asked them to protect him, his children and their mothers in the
new year.



as the day wore on his in-laws arrived from three surrounding
villages, and each party brought with them a huge pot of palm-
wine. and there was eating and drinking till night, when
okonkwo's in-laws began to leave for their homes the second day
of the new year was the day of the great wrestling match between
okon

kwo's village and their neighbors. it was difficult to say
which the people enjoyed more, the feasting and fellowship of the
first day or the wrestling contest of the second. but there was one
woman who had no doubt whatever in her mind. she was
okonkwo's second wife ekwefi, whom he nearly shot. there was
no festival in all the seasons of the year which gave her as much
pleasure as the wrestling match. many years ago when she was the
village beauty okonkwo had won her heart by throwing the cat in
the greatest contest within living memory. she did not marry him
then because he was too poor to pay her bride-price. but a few
years later she ran away from her husband and came to live with
okonkwo. all this happened many years ago. now ekwefi was a
woman of forty-five who had suffered a great deal in her time. but
her love of wrestling contests was still as strong as it was thirty
years ago.

it was not yet noon on the second day of the new yam festiv

p one."

"that means you will see something."

"what will i see?" she asked.

"how can i know?" ekwefi wanted her to work it out herself.

"oho," said ezinma at last. "i know what it is—the wrestling
match."

at last the hen was plucked clean. ekwefi tried to pull out the
horny beak but it was too hard. she turned round on her low stool
and put the beak in the fire for a few moments. she pulled again
and it came off.

"ekwefi!" a voice called from one of the other huts. it was
nwoye's mother, okonkwo's first wife.



"is that me?" ekwefi called back. that was the way people
answered calls from outside. they never answered yes for fear it
might be an evil spirit calling.



"will you give ezinma some fire to bring to me?" her own
children and ikemefuna had gone to the stream.

ekwefi put a few live coals into a piece of broken pot and ezinma
carried it across the clean swept compound to nwoye's mother.

"thank you, nma," she said. she was peeling new yams, and in a
basket beside her were gr

clouds of smoke. she went on fanning it until it burst into flames.
nwoye's mother thanked her and she went back to her mother's hut.

just then the distant beating of drums began to reach them. it came
from the direction of the ilo, the village playground. every village
had its own ilo which was as old as the village itself and where all



the great ceremonies and dances took place. the drums beat the
unmistakable wrestling dance - quick, light and gay, and it came
floating on the wind.



okonkwo cleared his throat and moved his feet to the beat of the
drums. it filled him with fire as it had always done from his youth.
he trembled with the desire to conquer and subdue. it was like the
desire for woman.

"we shall be late for the wrestling," said ezinma to her mother.

"they will not begin until the sun goes down."

"but they are beating the drums."

"yes. the drums begin at noon but the wrestling waits until the sun
begins to sink. go and see if your father has brought out yams for

laughing. she only began to weep when they got near the iroko
tree outside their compound.

the drums were still beating, persistent and unchanging. their
sound was no longer a separate thing from the living village. it was
like the pulsation of its heart. it throbbed in the air, in the sunshine,
and even in the trees, and filled the village with excitement.

ekwefi ladled her husband's share of the pottage into a bowl and
covered it. ezinma took it to him in his obi.

okonkwo was sitting on a goatskin already eating his first wife's
meal. obiageli, who had brought it from her mother's hut, sat on
the floor waiting for him to finish. ezinma placed her mother's dish
before him and sat with obiageli.



"sit like a woman!" okonkwo shouted at her. ezinma brought her
two legs together and stretched them in front of her.



"father, will you go to see the wrestling?" ezinma asked after a
suitable interval.

"yes," he answered. "will you go?"

"yes." and after a pause she
 
 ___________________________
 
 said: "can i bring your chair for
you?"

"no, that is a boy's job." okonkwo was specially fond of ezinma.
she looked very much like her mother, who was once the village
beauty. but his fondness only showed on very rare occasions.

"obiageli broke her pot today," ezinma said.

"yes, she has told me about it," okonkwo said between mouthfuls.

"father," said obiageli, "people should not talk when they are
eating or pepper may go down the wrong way."

"that is very true. do you hear that, ezinma? you are older than
obiageli but she has more sense."

he uncovered his second wife's dish and began to eat from it.
obiageli took the first dish and returned to her mother's hut. and
then nkechi came in, bringing the third dish. nkechi was the
daughter of okonkwo's third wife.

in the distance the drums continued to b

eat.

chapter six

the whole village turned out on the ilo, men, women and children.
they stood round in a huge circle leaving the center of the
playground free. the elders and grandees of the village sat on their



own stools brought there by their young sons or slaves. okonkwo
was among them. all others stood except those who came early
enough to secure places on the few stands which had been built by
placing smooth logs on forked pillars.



the wrestlers were not there yet and the drummers held the field.
they too sat just in front of the huge circle of spectators, facing the
elders. behind them was the big and ancient silk-cotton tree which
was sacred. spirits of good children lived in that tree waiting to be
born. on ordinary days young women who desired children

bouts
were over. but the third created a big sensation even among the
elders who did not usually show their excitement so openly. it was
as quick as the other two, perhaps even quicker. but very few





people had ever seen that kind of wrestling before. as soon as the
two boys closed in, one of them did something which no one could
describe because it had been as quick as a flash. and the other boy
was flat on his back. the crowd roared and clapped and for a while
drowned the frenzied drums. okonkwo sprang to his feet and
quickly sat down again. three young men from the victorious
boy's team ran forward, carried him shoulder high and danced
through the cheering crowd. everybody soon knew who the boy
was. his name was maduka, the son of obierika.

the drummers stopped for a brief rest before the real matches.
their bodies shone with sweat, and they took up fans and began to
fan themselves. they also drank water from small pots and ate kola
nuts. they became ordinary human beings again, talk

 who stood near them.
the air, which had been stretched taut with excitement, relaxed
again. it was as if water had been poured on the tightened skin of a
drum. many people looked around, perhaps for the first time, and
saw those who stood or sat next to them.

"i did not know it was you," ekwefi said to the woman who had
stood shoulder to shoulder with her since the beginning of the
matches.

"i do not blame you," said the woman. "i have never seen such a
large crowd of people. is it true that okonkwo nearly killed you
with his gun?"

"it is true indeed, my dear friend. i cannot yet find a mouth with
which to tell the story."

"your chi is very much awake, my friend. and how is my daughter,
ezinma?"

"she has been very well for some time now. perhaps she has come
to stay."



"i think she has. how old is she now?"

"she is about ten years old."



"i think she will stay. they usually stay if they do not die before
the age of six."

"i pray she stays," said ekwefi with a heavy sigh.

the wom

it over his rival's head. the crowd burst into a thunderous
roar. okafo was swept off his feet by his supporters and carried
home shoulder high. they sang his praise and the young women
clapped their hands:

"who will wrestle for our village?



okafo will wrestle for our village. has he thrown a hundred men?



he has thrown four hundred men. has he thrown a hundred cats?

he has thrown four hundred cats. then send him word to fight  for
us."

chapter seven

for three years ikemefuna lived in okonkwo's household and the
elders of umuofia seemed to have forgotten about him. he grew
rapidly like a yam tendril in the rainy season, and was full of the
sap of life. he had become wholly absorbed into his new family.
he was like an elder brother to nwoye, and from the very first
seemed to have kindled a new fire in the younger boy. he made
him feel grown-up, and they no longer spent the evenings in his
mother's hut while she cooked, but now sat with okonkwo in his
obi, or watched him as he tapped 
 
 ___________________________
 
his palm tree for the evening
wine. nothing pleased nwoye now more than to be sent for by his
mother or another of his father's wives to do one of those difficult
and masculine tasks in the home, like splitting wood, or pounding
food. on receiving such a message through a younger brother or
sister, nwoye would feign annoyance and grumble aloud about
women and their troubles.

okonkwo was inwardly pleased at his son's development, and he
knew it was due to ikemefuna. he wanted nwoye to grow into a
tough young man capable of ruling his father's household when he
was dead and gone to join the ancestors.

he wanted him to be a prosperous man, having enough in his barn
to feed the ancestors with regular sacrifices. and so he was always
happy when he heard him grumbling about women. that showed
that in time he would be able to control his women-folk. no matter
how prosperous a ma

n was, if he was unable to rule his women and
his children (and especially his women) he was not really a man.



he was like the man in the song who had ten and one wives and
not enough soup for his foo-foo.



so okonkwo encouraged the boys to sit with him in his obi, and he
told them stories of the land—masculine stories of violence and
bloodshed. nwoye knew that it was right to be masculine and to be
violent, but somehow he still preferred the stories that his mother
used to tell, and which she no doubt still told to her younger
children—stories of the tortoise and his wily ways, and of the bird
eneke-nti-oba who challenged the whole world to a wrestling
contest and was finally thrown by the cat. he remem

re he had espied a fire. and when he got
there he found it was a man making a sacrifice. he warmed
himself in the fire and ate the entrails.

that was the kind of story that nwoye loved. but he now knew
that they were for foolish women and children, and he knew that
his father wanted him to be a man. and so he feigned that he no
longer cared for women's stories. and when he did this he saw that
his father was pleased, and no longer rebuked him or beat him. so
nwoye and ikemefuna would listen to okonkwo's stories about
tribal wars, or how, years ago, he had stalked his victim,



overpowered him and obtained his first human head. and as he
told them of the past they sat in darkness or the dim glow of logs,
waiting for the women to finish their cooking. when they finished,
each brought her bowl of foo-foo and bowl of soup to her husband.
an oil lamp was lit and okonkwo tasted from each bowl, and then
passed two shares to nwoye and ikemefuna.



in this way the moons and the seasons passed. and

e. it had not happened for many a long year. the elders said
locusts came once in a generation, reappeared every year for seven
years and then disappeared for another lifetime. they went back to
their caves in a distant land, where they were guarded by a race of
stunted men. and then after another lifetime these men opened the
caves again and the locusts came to umuofia.

they came in the cold harmattan season after the harvests had been
gathered, and ate up all the wild grass in the fields.



okonkwo and the two boys were working on the red outer walls of
the compound. this was one of the lighter tasks of the after-harvest
season. a new cover of thick palm branches and palm leaves was
set on the walls to protect them from the next rainy season.
okonkwo worked on the outside of the wall and the boys worked
from within. there were little holes from one side to the other in
the upper levels of the wall, and through these okonkwo passed the
rope, or tie-tie, to the boys and they passed it round
 
 ___________________________
 
 the wooden
stays and then back to him,- and in this way the cover was
strengthened on the wall.

the women had gone to the bush to collect firewood, and the little
children to visit their playmates in the neighboring compounds.
the harmattan was in the air and seemed to distill a hazy feeling of
sleep on the world. okonkwo and the boys worked in complete
silence, which was only broken when a new palm frond was lifted



on to the wall or when a busy hen moved dry leaves about in her
ceaseless search for food.



and then quite suddenly a shadow fell on the world, and the sun
seemed hidden behind a thick cloud. okonkwo looked up from his
work and wondered if it was going to rain at such an unlikely time
of the year. but almost immediately a shout of joy broke out in all
directions, and umuofia, which had dozed in
 
 ___________________________
 
people went out with baskets trying to catch them, but the
elders counseled patience till nightfall. and they were right. the
locusts settled in the bushes for the night and their wings became



wet with dew. then all umuofia turned out in spite of the cold
harmattan, and everyone filled his bags and pots with locusts. the
next morning they were roasted in clay pots and then spread in the
sun until they became dry and brittle. and for many days this rare
food was eaten with solid palm-oil.



okonkwo sat in his obi crunching happily with ikemefuna and
nwoye, and drinking palm-wine copiously, when ogbuefi ezeudu
came in. ezeudu was the oldest man in this quarter of umuofia. he
had been a great and fearless warrior in his time, and was now
accorded great respect in all the clan. he refused to join in the meal,
and asked okonkwo to have a word with him outside. and so they
walked out together, the old man supporting himself with his stick.
when they were out of earshot, he said to okonkwo:

"t
 
 ___________________________
 
hat boy calls you father. do not bear a hand in his death."
okonkwo was surprised, and was about to say something when the
old man continued:

"yes, umuofia has decided to kill him. the oracle of the hills and
the caves has pronounced it. they will take him outside umuofia
as is the custom, and kill him there. but i want you to have nothing
to do with it. he calls you his father."

the next day a group of elders from all the nine villages of
umuofia came to okonkwo's house early in the morning, and
before they began to speak in low tones nwoye and ikemefuna
were sent out. they did not stay very long, but when they went
away okonkwo sat still for a very long time supporting his chin in
his palms. later in the day he called ikemefuna and told him that
he was to be taken home the next day. nwoye overheard it and
burst into tears, whereupon his father beat him heavily. as for
ikemefuna, he was at a loss. his own home had gradually become
very faint and distan
 
 ___________________________
 
oye went to his mother's hut and told her that ikemefuna
was going home. she immediately dropped her pestle with which
she was grinding pepper, folded her arms across her breast and
sighed, "poor child."

the next day, the men returned with a pot of wine. they were all
fully dressed as if they were going to a big clan meeting or to pay a
visit to a neighboring village. they passed their cloths under the
right arm-pit, and hung their goatskin bags and sheathed machetes
over their left shoulders. okonkwo got ready quickly and the party
set out with ikemefuna carrying the pot of wine. a deathly silence
descended on okonkwo's compound. even the very little children
seemed to know. throughout that day nwoye sat in his mother's
hut and tears stood in his eyes.

at the beginning of their journey the men of umuofia talked and
laughed about the locusts, about their women, and about some
effeminate men who had refused to come with them. but as they
drew near to the outskirts of umuofia silence fell upo

e on the sandy
footway.

ikemefuna heard a whisper close behind him and turned round
sharply. the man who had whispered now called out aloud, urging
the others to hurry up.

"we still have a long way to go," he said. then he and another man
went before ikemefuna and set a faster pace.

thus the men of umuofia pursued their way, armed with sheathed
machetes, and ikemefuna, carrying a pot of palm-wine on his head,
walked in their midst. although he had felt uneasy at first, he was
not afraid now. okonkwo walked behind him. he could hardly
imagine that okonkwo was not his real father. he had never been
fond of his real father, and at the end of three years he had become
very distant indeed. but his mother and his three-year-old sister…
of course she would not be three now, but six. would he recognize
her now? she must have grown quite big. how his mother would
weep for joy, and thank okonkwo for having looked after him so
well and for bringing him back. she would want to hear everything

ain, and it ended on the left. but the
second time did not count. the first voice gets to chukwu, or
god's house. that was a favorite saying of children. ikemefuna felt
like a child once more. it must be the thought of going home to his
mother.

one of the men behind him cleared his throat. ikemefuna looked
back, and the man growled at him to go on and not stand looking
back. the way he said it sent cold fear down ikemefuna's back. his
hands trembled vaguely on the black pot he carried. why had
okonkwo withdrawn to the rear? ikemefuna felt his legs melting
under him. and he was afraid to look back.

as the man who had cleared his throat drew up and raised his
machete, okonkwo looked away. he heard the blow. the pot fell
and broke in the sand. he heard ikemefuna cry, "my father, they
have killed me!" as he ran towards him. dazed with fear, okonkwo
drew his machete and cut him down. he was afraid of being
thought weak.





as soon as his father walked in, that night, nwoye knew that
ikemefuna

en on the women, who had been talking, and
they had quickened their steps. nwoye had heard that twins were
put in earthenware pots and thrown away in the forest, but he had
never yet come across them. a vague chill had descended on him
and his head had seemed to swell, like a solitary walker at night
who passes an evil spirit an the way. then something had given
way inside him. it descended on him again, this feeling, when his
father walked in that night after killing ikemefuna.

chapter eight

okonkwo did not taste any food for two days after the death of
ikemefuna. he drank palm-wine from morning till night, and his
eyes were red and fierce like the eyes of a rat when it was caught
by the tail and dashed against the floor. he called his son, nwoye,
to sit with him in his obi. but the boy was afraid of him and
slipped out of the hut as soon as he noticed him dozing.

he did not sleep at night. he tried not to think about ikemefuna,-
but the more he tried the more he thought about him. once h

is legs could hardly carry him. he felt like a drunken giant
walking with the limbs of a mosquito. now and then a cold shiver
descended on his head and spread down his body.



on the third day he asked his second wife, ekwefi, to roast
plantains for him. she prepared it the way he liked—with slices of
oil-bean and fish.

"you have not eaten for two days," said his daughter ezinma when
she brought the food to him. "so you must finish this." she sat
down and stretched her legs in front of her. okonkwo ate the food
absent-mindedly. 'she should have been a boy,' he thought as he
looked at his ten-year-old daughter. he passed her a piece of fish.

"go and bring me some cold water," he said. ezinma rushed out of
the hut, chewing the fish, and soon returned with a bowl of cool
water from the earthen pot in her mother's hut.

okonkwo took the bowl from her and gulped the water down. he
ate a few more pieces of plaintain and pushed the dish aside.

"bring me my bag," he asked, and ezinma brought hi

 each other as he searched. when he brought out
the snuff-bottle he tapped it a few times against his knee-cap
before taking out some snuff on the palm of his left hand. then he
remembered that he had not taken out his snuff-spoon. he searched
his bag again and brought out a small, flat, ivory spoon, with
which he carried the brown snuff to his nostrils.

ezinma took the dish in one hand and the empty water bowl in the
other and went back to her mother's hut. "she should have been a





boy," okonkwo said to himself again. his mind went back to
ikemefuna and he shivered. if only he could find some work to do
he would be able to forget. but it was the season of rest between
the harvest and the next planting season. the only work that men
did at this time was covering the walls of their compound with new
palm fronds. and okonkwo had already done that. he had finished
it on the very day the locusts came, when he had worked on one
side of the wall and ikemefuna and nwoye on the other.

"when di

d you become a shivering old woman," okonkwo asked
himself, "you, who are known in all the nine villages for your valor
in war? how can a man who has killed five men in battle fall to
pieces because he has added a boy to their number? okonkwo, you
have become a woman indeed."

he sprang to his feet, hung his goatskin bag on his shoulder and
went to visit his friend, obierika.

obierika was sitting outside under the shade of an orange tree
making thatches from leaves of the raffia-palm. he exchanged
greetings with okonkwo and led the way into his obi.

"i was coming over to see you as soon as i finished that thatch," he
said, rubbing off the grains of sand that clung to his thighs.

"is it well?" okonkwo asked.

"yes," replied obieri

ka. "my daughter's suitor is coming today and
i hope we will clinch the matter of the bride-price. i want you to be
there."

just then obierika's son, maduka, came into the obi from outside,
greeted okonkwo and turned towards the compound,



"come and shake hands with me," okonkwo said to the lad. "your
wrestling the other day gave me much happiness." the boy smiled,
shook hands with okonkwo and went into the compound.



"he will do great things," okonkwo said. "if i had a son like him i
should be happy. i am worried about nwoye. a bowl of pounded
yams can throw him in a wrestling match. his two younger
brothers are more promising. but i can tell you, obierika, that my
children do not resemble me. where are the young suckers that
will grow when the old banana tree dies? if ezinma had been a boy
i would have been happier. she has the right spirit."

"you worry yourself for nothing," said obierika. "the children are
still very young."

"nwoye is o

ld enough to impregnate a woman. at his age i was
already fending for myself. no, my friend, he is not too young. a
chick that will grow into a cock can be spotted the very day it
hatches. i have done my best to make nwoye grow into a man, but
there is too much of his mother in him."

"too much of his grandfather," obierika thought, but he did not
say it. the same thought also came to okonkwo's mind. but he had
long learned how to lay that ghost. whenever the thought of his
father's weakness and failure troubled him he expelled it by
thinking about his own strength and success. and so he did now.
his mind went to his latest show of manliness.

"i cannot understand why you refused to come with us to kill that
boy," he asked obierika.

"because i did not want to," obierika replied sharply. "i had
something better to do."

"you sound as if you question the authority and the decision of

 the
oracle, who said he should die."




"i do not. why should i? but the oracle did not ask me to carry out
its decision."

"but someone had to do it. if we were all afraid of blood, it would
not be done. and what do you think the oracle would do then?"

"you know very well, okonkwo, that i am not afraid of blood  and
if anyone tells you that i am, he is telling a lie. and let me tell you
one thing, my friend. if i were you i would have stayed at home.
what you have done will not please the earth. it is the kind of
action for which the goddess wipes out whole families."

"the earth cannot punish me for obeying her messenger,"
okonkwo said. "a child's fingers are not scalded by a piece of hot
yam which its mother puts into its palm."

"that is true," obierika agreed. "but i

f the oracle said that my son
should be killed i would neither dispute it nor be the one to do it."

they would have gone on arguing had ofoedu not come in just
then. it was clear from his twinkling eyes that he had important
news. but it would be impolite to rush him. obierika offered him a
lobe of the kola nut he had broken with okonkwo. ofoedu ate
slowly and talked about the locusts. when he finished his kola nut
he said:

"the things that happen these days are very strange."

"what has happened?" asked okonkwo.

"do you know ogbuefi ndulue?" ofoedu asked.

"ogbuefi ndulue of ire village," okonkwo and obierika said
together.

"he died this morning," said ofoedu.



"that is not strange. he was the oldest man in ire," said obierika.



"you are right," ofoedu agreed. "but you ought to ask why the
drum has not beaten to tell u
 
 ___________________________
 
muofia of his death."

"why?" asked obierika and okonkwo together.

"that is the strange part of it. you know his first wife who walks
with a stick?"

"yes. she is called ozoemena."

"that is so," said ofoedu. "ozoemena was, as you know, too old to
attend ndulue during his illness. his younger wives did that. when
he died this morning, one of these women went to ozoemena's hut
and told her. she rose from her mat, took her stick and walked over
to the obi. she knelt on her knees and hands at the threshold and
called her husband, who was laid on a mat.
 
 ___________________________
 
 'ogbuefi ndulue,' she
called, three times, and went back to her hut. when the youngest
wife went to call her again to be present at the washing of the body,
she found her lying on the mat, dead."

"that is very strange, indeed," said okonkwo. "they will put off
ndulue's funeral until his wife has been buried."

"that is why the drum has not been beaten to tell umuofla."

"it was always said that ndulue and ozoemena had one mind,"
said obierika. "i remember when i was a young boy there was a
song about them. he could not do anything without telling her."

"i did not know that," said okonkwo. "i thought he was a strong
man in his youth."

"he was indeed," said ofoedu.

okonkwo shook his head doubtfully.



"he led umuofia to war in 
 
 ___________________________
 
those days," said obierika.



okonkwo was beginning to feel like his old self again. all that he
required was something to occupy his mind. if he had killed
ikemefuna during the busy planting season or harvesting it would
not have been so bad, his mind would have been centered on his
work. okonkwo was not a man of thought but of action. but in
absence of work, talking was the next best.

soon after ofoedu left, okonkwo took up his goatskin bag to go.

"i must go home to tap my palm trees for the afternoon," he said.

"who taps your tall trees for you?" asked obierika.

"umezulike," replied okonkwo.

"sometimes i wish i had not taken the ozo title," said obierika. "it
wounds my heart to see these young men killing palm trees in the
name of tapping."

"it is so indeed," okonkwo agreed. "but the law of the land must
be obeyed."

"i don't know how we got that law," said obierika. "in many other
clans a man of tit
 
 ___________________________
 
le is not forbidden to climb the palm tree. here
we say he cannot climb the tall tree but he can tap the short ones
standing on the ground. it is like dimaragana, who would not lend
his knife for cutting up dogmeat because the dog was taboo to him,
but offered to use his teeth."

"i think it is good that our clan holds the ozo title in high esteem,"
said okonkwo. "in those other clans you speak of, ozo is so low
that every beggar takes it."




"i was only speaking in jest," said obierika. "in abame and aninta
the title is worth less than two cowries. every man wears the
thread of title on his ankle, and does not lose it even if he steals."

"they have indeed soiled the name of ozo," said okonkwo as he
rose to go.

"it will not be very long now before my in-laws come," said
obierika.

"i shall return very soon," said okonkwo, looking at the position o

the sun.

there were seven men in obierika's hut when okonkwo returned.
the suitor was a young man of about twenty-five, and with him
were his father and uncle. on obierika's side were his two elder
brothers and maduka, his sixteen-year-old son.

"ask akueke's mother to send us some kola nuts," said obierika to
his son. maduka vanished into the compound like lightning. the
conversation at once centered on him, and everybody agreed that
he was as sharp as a razor.

"i sometimes think he is too sharp," said obierika, somewhat
indulgently. "he hardly ever wa

downwards with her palms until it passed the buttocks and slipped
down to the floor around her feet.

the men in the obi had already begun to drink the palm-wine
which akueke's suitor had brought. it was a very good wine and
powerful, for in spite of the palm fruit hung across the mouth of
the pot to restrain the lively liquor, white foam rose and spilled
over.

"that wine is the work of a good tapper," said okonkwo.



the young suitor, whose name was ibe, smiled broadly and said to
his father: "do you hear that?" he then said to the others: "he will
never admit that i am a good tapper."



"he tapped three of my best palm trees to death," said his father,
ukegbu.

"that was about five years ago," said ibe, who had begun to pour
out the wine, "before i learned how to tap." he filled the first horn
and gave to his father. then he poured out for the others. okonkwo
brought out lüs big horn from the goatsk

ce was finally settled at twenty bags
of cowries. it was already dusk when the two parties came to this
agreement.



"go and tell akueke's mother that we have finished," obierika said
to his son, maduka. almost immediately the women came in with
a big bowl of foo-foo. obierika's second wife followed with a pot
of soup, and maduka brought in a pot of palm-wine.

as the men ate and drank palm-wine they talked about the customs
of their neighbors.

"it was only this morning," said obierika, "that okonkwo and i
were talking about abame and aninta, where titled men climb
trees and pound foo-foo for their wives."

"all their customs are upside-down. they do not decide bride-
price as we do, with sticks. they haggle and bargain as if they
were buying a goat or a cow in the market."

"that is very bad," said obierika's eldest brother. "but what is
good in one place is bad in another place. in umunso they do not
bargain at all, not even with broomsticks. the suitor just goes on
bringing bags of cowri

es until his in-laws tell him to stop. it is a
bad custom because it always leads to a quarrel."

"the world is large," said okonkwo. "i have even heard that in
some tribes a man's children belong to his wife and her family."

"that cannot be," said machi. "you might as well say that the
woman lies on top of the man when they are making the children."

"it is like the story of white men who, they say, are white like this
piece of chalk," said obierika. he held up a piece of chalk, which
every man kept in his obi and with which his guests drew lines on




the floor before they ate kola nuts. "and these white men, they say,

 
 ___________________________
 
have no toes."

"and have you never seen them?" asked machi.

"have you?" asked obierika.

"one of them passes here frequently," said machi. "his name is
amadi."

those who knew amadi laughed. he was a leper, and the polite
name for leprosy was "the white skin."

chapter nine

for the first time in three nights, okonkwo slept. he woke up once
in the middle of the night and his mind went back to the past three
days without making him feel uneasy. he began to wonder why he
had felt uneasy at all. it was like a man wondering in broad
daylight why a dream had appeared so terrible to him at night. he
stretched himself and scratched his thigh where a mosquito had
bitten him as he slept. another one was wailing near his right ear.
he slapped the ear and hoped he had killed it. why do they always
go for one's ears? wh
 
 ___________________________
 
en he was a child his mother had told him a
story about it. but it was as silly as all women's stories. mosquito,
she had said, had asked ear to marry him, whereupon ear fell on
the floor in uncontrollable laughter. "how much longer do you
think you will live?" she asked. "you are already a skeleton."
mosquito went away humiliated, and any time he passed her way
he told ear that he was still alive.

okonkwo turned on his side and went back to sleep. he was
roused in the morning by someone banging on his door.

"who is that?" he growled. he knew it must be ekwefi.



of his three wives ekwefi was the only one who would have the
audacity to bang on his door.



"ezinma is dying," came her voice, and all the tragedy and sorrow
of her life were packed in those words.

okonkwo sprang from his bed, pushed back the bolt on his door
and ran into ekwefi's hut.

ezinma lay shivering on a mat beside a huge 
 
 ___________________________
 
fire that her mother
had kept burning all night.

"it is iba," said okonkwo as he took his machete and went into the
bush to collect the leaves and grasses and barks of trees that went
into making the medicine for iba.

ekwefi knelt beside the sick child, occasionally feeling with her
palm the wet, burning forehead.

ezinma was an only child and the center of her mother's world.
very often it was ezinma who decided what food her mother
should prepare. ekwefi even gave her such delicacies as eggs,
which children were rarely allowed to eat because such food
tempted them 
 
 ___________________________
 
to steal. one day as ezinma was eating an egg
okonkwo had come in unexpectedly from his hut. he was greatly
shocked and swore to beat ekwefi if she dared to give the child
eggs again. but it was impossible to refuse ezinma anything. after
her father's rebuke she developed an even keener appetite for eggs.
and she enjoyed above all the secrecy in which she now ate them.
her mother always took her into their bedroom and shut the door.

ezinma did not call her mother nne like all children. she called her
by her name, ekwefi, as her father and other g

ecame an empty ritual. her
deepening despair found expression in the names she gave her
children. one of them was a pathetic cry, onwumbiko—"death, i
implore you." but death took no notice,- onwumbiko died in his
fifteenth month. the next child was a girl, ozoemena—"may it not
happen again." she died in her eleventh month, and two others
after her. ekwefi then became defiant and called her next child
onwuma—"death may please himself." and he did.

after the death of ekwefi's second child, okonkwo had gone to a
medicine man, who was also a diviner of the afa oracle, to inquire
what was amiss. this man told him that the child was an ogbanje,
one of those wicked children who, when they died, entered their
mothers' wombs to be born again.

"when your wife becomes pregnant again," he said, "let her not
sleep in her hut. let her go and stay with her people. in that way
she will elude her wicked tormentor and break its evil cycle of
birth and death."

ekwefi did as she was asked. as soon as sh
 
 ___________________________
 
e became pregnant she
went to live with her old mother in another village. it was there
that her third child was born and circumcised on the eighth day.
she did not return to okonkwo's compound until three days before
the naming ceremony. the child was called onwumbiko.





onwumbiko was not given proper burial when he died. okonkwo
had called in another medicine man who was famous in the clan
for his great knowledge about ogbanje children. his name was
okagbue uyanwa. okagbue was a very striking figure, tall, with a
full beard and a bald head. he was light in complexion and his
eyes were red and fiery. he always gnashed his teeth as he listened
to those who came to consult him. he asked okonkwo a few
questions about the dead child. all the neighbors and relations who
had come to mourn gathered round them.

"on what market
 
 ___________________________
 
-day was it born?" he asked.

"oye," replied okonkwo.

"and it died this morning?"

okonkwo said yes, and only then realized for the first time that the
child had died on the same market-day as it had been born. the
neighbors and relations also saw the coincidence and said among
themselves that it was very significant.

"where do you sleep with your wife, in your obi or in her own
hut?" asked the medicine man.

"in her hut."

"in future call her into your obi."

the medicine man then ordered that there should be no mourning
for the dead child. he brought out a sharp razor from the goa

g it by the
ankle and dragging it on the ground behind him. after such
treatment it would think twice before coming again, unless it was
one of the stubborn ones who returned, carrying the stamp of their



mutilation—a missing finger or perhaps a dark line where the
medicine man's razor had cut them.



by the time onwumbiko died ekwefi had become a very bitter
woman. her husband's first wife had already had three sons, all
strong and healthy. when she had borne her third son in succession,
okonkwo had slaughtered a goat for her, as was the custom.
ekwefi had nothing but good wishes for her. but she had grown so
bitter about her own chi that she could not rejoice with others over
their good fortune. and so, on the day that nwoye's mother
celebrated the birth of her three sons with feasting and music,
ekwefi was the only person in the happy company who went about
with a cloud on her brow. her husband's wife took this for
malevolence, as husbands' wives were wont to. how could she
know that

ost of them never did because they died too
young - before they could be asked questions.

"where did you bury your iyi-uwa?" okagbue had asked ezinma.
she was nine then and was just recovering from a serious illness.

"what is iyi-uwa?" she asked in return.

"you know what it is. you buried it in the ground somewhere so
that you can die and return again to torment your mother."

ezinma looked at her mother, whose eyes, sad and pleading, were
fixed on her.

"answer the question at once," roared okonkwo, who stood beside
her. all the family were there and some of the neighbors too.

"leave her to me," the medicine man told okonkwo in a cool,
confident voice. he turned again to ezinma. "where did you bury
your iyi-uwa?"

"where they bury children," she replied, and the quiet spectators
murmured to themselves.



"come along then and show me the spot," said the medicine man.



the crowd set out with ezinma leading the way and okagbue
following closely behind her. okonkwo came next and ekwefi
f

o the bush,
and the crowd followed her. because of her size she made her way
through trees and creepers more quickly than her followers. the
bush was alive with the tread of feet on dry leaves and sticks and
the moving aside of tree branches. ezinma went deeper and deeper
and the crowd went with her. then she suddenly turned round and
began to walk back to the road. everybody stood to let her pass
and then filed after her.

"if you bring us all this way for nothing i shall beat sense into
you," okonkwo threatened.

"1 have told you to let her alone. 1 know how to deal with  them,"
said okagbue.

ezinma led the way back to the road, looked left and right and
turned right. and so they arrived home again.



"where did you bury your iyi-uwa?" asked okagbue when ezinma
finally stopped outside her father's obi. okagbue's voice was
unchanged. it was quiet and confident.



"it is near that orange tree," ezinma said.

"and why did you not say so, you wicked daughter of akalogoli?"
okonkwo swore fur
 
 ___________________________
 
iously. the medicine man ignored him.

"come and show me the exact spot," he said quietly to ezinma.

"it is here," she said when they got to the tree.

"point at the spot with your finger," said okagbue.

"it is here," said ezinma touching the ground with her finger.
okonkwo stood by, rumbling like thunder in the rainy season.

"bring me a hoe," said okagbue.

'when ekwefi brought the hoe, he had already put aside his
goatskin bag and his big cloth and was in his underwear, a long
and thin strip of cloth wound round the waist like a belt and then
passed between the legs to be fastened to the belt behind. he
immediately set to work digging a pit where ezinma had indicated.
the neighbors sat around watching the pit becoming deeper and
deeper. the dark top soil soon g

ave way to the bright red earth
with which women scrubbed the floors and walls of huts. okagbue
worked tirelessly and in silence, his back shining with perspiration.
okonkwo stood by the pit. he asked okagbue to come up and rest
while he took a hand. but okagbue said he was not tired yet.

ekwefi went into her hut to cook yams. her husband had brought
out more yams than usual because the medicine man had to be fed.
ezinma went with her and helped in preparing the vegetables.

"there is too much green vegetable," she said.



"don't you see the pot is full of yams?" ekwefi asked. "and you
know how leaves become smaller after cooking."



"yes," said ezinma, "that w

as why the snake-lizard killed his
mother."

"very true," said ekwefi.

"he gave his mother seven baskets of vegetables to cook and in the
end there were only three. and so he killed her," said ezinma.

"that is not the end of the story."

"oho," said ezinma. "i remember now. he brought another seven
baskets and cooked them himself. and there were again only three.
so he killed himself too."

outside the obi okagbue and okonkwo were digging the pit to
find where ezinma had buried her iyi-uwa. neighbors sat around,
watching. the pit was now so deep that they no longer saw the
digger. they only saw the red earth he threw up mounting higher
and higher. okonkwo's son, nwoye, stood near the edge of the pit
because he wanted to take in all that happened.

okagbue had again taken over the digging from okonkwo. he
worked, as usual, in silence. the neighbors and okonkwo's wives
were now talking. the children had lost interest 
 
 ___________________________
 
and were playing.

suddenly okagbue sprang to the surface with the agility of a
leopard.

"it is very near now," he said. "i have felt it."

there was immediate excitement and those who were sitting
jumped to their feet.



"call your wife and child," he said to okonkwo. but ekwefi and
ezinma had heard the noise and run out to see what it was.



okagbue went back into the pit, which was now surrounded by
spectators. after a few more hoe-fuls of earth he struck the iyi-uwa.
he raised it carefully with the hoe and threw it to the surface.
some women ran away in fear when it was thrown. but they soon
returned and everyone was gazing at the rag from a reasonable
distance. okagbue emerged and without saying a word or even
looking at the spectators he went to his g
 
 ___________________________
 
joy because
ekwefi's troubles were at last ended.

all this had happened more than a year ago and ezinma had not
been ill since. and then suddenly she had begun to shiver in the
night. ekwefi brought her to the fireplace, spread her mat on the
floor and built a fire. but she had got worse and worse. as she
knelt by her, feeling with her palm the wet, burning forehead, she
prayed a thousand times. although her husband's wives were
saying that it was nothing more than iba, she did not hear them.

okonkwo returned from the bush carrying on his left shoulder a
large bundle of grasses and leaves, roots and barks of medicinal
trees and shrubs. he went into ekwefi's hut, put down his load and
sat down.

"get me a pot," he said, "and leave the child alone."



ekwefi went to bring the pot and okonkwo selected the best from
his bundle, in their due proportions, and cut them up. he put them
in the pot and ekwefi poured in some water.



"is that enough?" she asked when she had poured in about half of

 
 ___________________________
 
the water in the bowl.

"a little more… i said a little. are you deaf?" okonkwo roared at
her.

she set the pot on the fire and okonkwo took up his machete to
return to his obi.

"you must watch the pot carefully," he said as he went, "and don't
allow it to boil over. if it does its power will be gone." he went
away to his hut and ekwefi began to tend the medicine pot almost
as if it was itself a sick child. her eyes went constantly from
ezinma to the boiling pot and back to ezinma.

okonkwo returned when he felt the medicine had cooked long
anough. he looked it over and said it was done.

"bring me a low stool for ezinma," he said, "and a thick mat."

he took down the pot from the fire and placed it in front of the
stool. he then roused ezinma and placed her on the stool, astride
the steaming pot. the thick mat was thrown over both. ezinma
struggled to escape from the choking and overpowering steam, but
she was held down. she started to cry.

when the mat was at last removed she w

evil forest then thrust the pointed end of his rattling staff into the
earth. and it began to shake and rattle, like something agitating
with a metallic life. he took the first of the empty stools and the
eight other egwugwu began to sit in order of seniority after him.

okonkwo's wives, and perhaps other women as well, might have
noticed that the second egwugwu had the springy

walk of okonkwo. and they might also have noticed that
okonkwo was not among the titled men and elders who sat behind
the row of egwugwu. but if they thought these things they kept
them within themselves. the egwugwu with the springy walk was
one of the dead fathers of the clan. he looked terrible with the

had been rising later
and later every night until now it was seen only at dawn. and
whenever the moon forsook evening and rose at cock-crow the
nights were as black as charcoal.

ezinma and her mother sat on a mat on the floor after their supper
of yam foo-foo and bitter-leaf soup. a palm-oil lamp gave out
yellowish light. without it, it would have been impossible to eat,-
one could not have known where one's mouth was in the darkness
of that night. there was an oil lamp in all the four huts on
okonkwo's compound, and each hut seen from the others looked
like a soft eye of yellow half-light set in the solid massiveness of
night.

the world was silent except for the shrill cry of insects, which was
part of the night, and the sound of wooden mortar and pestle as
nwayieke pounded her foo-foo. nwayieke lived four compounds



away, and she was notorious for her late cooking. every woman in
the neighborhood knew the sound of nwayieke's mortar and pestle.
it was also part of the night.



okonkwo

had eaten from his wives' dishes and was now

reclining with his back against the wall. he searched his bag and
brought out his snuff-bottle. he turned it on to his left palm, but
nothing came out. he hit the bottle against his knee to shake up the
tobacco. that was always the trouble with okeke's snuff. it very
quickly went damp, and there was too much saltpeter in it.
okonkwo had not bought snuff from him for a long time. idigo
was the man who knew how to grind good snuff. but he had
recently fallen ill.

low voices, broken now and again by singing, reached okonkwo
from his wives' huts as each woman and her children told folk
stories. ekwefi and her daughter, ezinma, sat on a mat on the floor.
it was ekwefl's turn to tell a story.

"once upon a time," she began, "all the birds were invited to a
feast in the sky. they were very happy and began to prepare
themselves f
 
 ___________________________
 
a
time there was a great famine in the land of animals. everybody
was lean except cat, who was fat and whose body shone as if oil
was rubbed on it…"

she broke off because at that very moment a loud and high-pitched
voice broke the outer silence of the night. it was chielo, the



priestess of agbala, prophesying. there was nothing new in that.
once in a while chielo was possessed by the spirit of her god and
she began to prophesy. but tonight she was addressing her
prophecy and greetings to okonkwo, and so everyone in his family
listened. the folk stories stopped.



"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o-o," came the voice like a
sharp knife cutting through the night. "okonkwo! agbala ekme gio-
o-o-o! agbala cholu ifu ada ya ezinmao-o-o-oi"

at the mention of ezinma's name ekwefi jerked her head sharply
like an animal that had sniffed death in the air. her heart jumped
painfully within her.

the priestess had now reached okonkwo's compound and was
talking with him outside his hut. she was
 
 ___________________________
 
 saying again and again
that agbala wanted to see his daughter, ezinma. okonkwo pleaded
with her to come back in the morning because ezinma was now
asleep. but chielo ignored what he was trying to say and went on
shouting that agbala wanted to see his daughter. her voice was as
clear as metal, and okonkwo's women and children heard from
their huts all that she said. okonkwo was still pleading that the girl
had been ill of late and was asleep. ekwefi quickly took her to their
bedroom and placed her on their high bamboo bed.

the priestess screamed. "beware, okonkwo!" she warned.
"beware of exchanging words with agbala. does a man speak
when a god speaks? beware!"

she walked through okonkwo's hut into the circular compound
and went straight toward ekwefi's hut. okonkwo came after her.

"ekwefi," she called, "agbala greets you. where is my daughter,
ezinma? agbala w

ants to see her."



ekwefi came out from her hut carrying her oil lamp in her left
hand. there was a light wind blowing, so she cupped her right
hand to shelter the flame. nwoye's mother, also carrying an oil
lamp, emerged from her hut. the children stood in the darkness
outside their hut watching the strange event. okonkwo's youngest
wife also came out and joined the others.



"where does agbala want to see her?" ekwefi asked.

"where else but in his house in the hills and the caves?" replied the
priestess.

"i will come with you, too," ekwefi said firmly.

"tufia-al" the priestess cursed, her voice cracking like the angry
bark of thunder in the dry season. "how dare you, woman, to go
before the mighty agbala of your own accord? beware, woman,
lest he strike you in his anger. bring me my daughter."

ekwefi went

ing soup. she broke a piece in
two and gave it to ezinma, who clung to her.



"don't be afraid," said ekwefi, stroking her head, which was
shaved in places, leaving a regular pattern of hair. they went
outside again. the priestess bent down on one knee and ezinma
climbed on her back, her left palm closed on her fish and her eyes
gleaming with tears.



"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o! …" chielo began once
again to chant greetings to her god. she turned round sharply and
walked through okonkwo's hut, bending very low at the eaves.
ezinma was crying loudly now, calling on her mother. the two
voices disappeared into the thick darkness.

a strange and sudden weakness descended on ekwefi as she stood
gazing in the direction of the voices like a hen whose only chick
has been carried away by a kite. ezinma's voice soon faded away
and only chielo was heard moving farther and farther into the
distance.

"why do you stand there as though she had been kidnapped?"
asked okonkwo as he went back 
 
 ___________________________
 
to his hut.

"she will bring her back soon," nwoye's mother said.

but ekwefi did not hear these consolations. she stood for a while,
and then, all of a sudden, made up her mind. she hurried through
okonkwo's hut and went outside. "where are you going?" he asked.

"i am following chielo," she replied and disappeared in the
darkness. okonkwo cleared his throat, and brought out his snuff-
bottle from the goatskin bag by his side.

the priestess' voice was already growing faint in the distance.
ekwefi hurried to the main footpath and turned left in the direction
of the voice. her eyes were useless to her in the darkness. but she
picked her way easily on the sandy footpath hedged on either side
by branches and damp leaves. she began to run, holding her





breasts with her hands to stop them flapping noisily against her
body. she hi

 waited.
her fear had vanished. she could hear the priestess' voice, all its
metal taken out of it by the vast emptiness of the cave. she buried
her face in her lap and waited.

she did not know how long she waited. it must have been a very
long time. her back was turned on the footpath that led out of the
hills. she must have heard a noise behind her and turned round
sharply. a man stood there with a machete in his hand. ekwefi
uttered a scream and sprang to her feet.

"don't be foolish," said okonkwo's voice. "1 thought you were
going into the shrine with chielo," he mocked.

ekwefi did not answer. tears of gratitude filled her eyes. she knew
her daughter was safe.

"go home and sleep," said okonkwo. "1 shall wait here."

"i shall wait too. it is almost dawn. the first cock has crowed."

as they stood there together, ekwefi's mind went back to the days
when they were young. she had married anene because okonkwo
was too poor then to marry. two years after her marriage to anene
she could bear

 it no longer and she ran away to okonkwo. it had
been early in the morning. the moon was shining. she was going
to the stream to fetch water. okonkwo's house was on the way to



the stream. she went in and knocked at his door and he came out.
even in those days he was not a man of many words. he just
carried her into his bed and in the darkness began to feel around
her waist for the loose end of her cloth.





chapter twelve

on the following morning the entire neighborhood wore a festive
air because okonkwo's friend, obierika, was celebrating his
daughter's uri. it was the day on which her suitor (having already
paid the greater part of 
 
 ___________________________
 
her bride-price) would bring palm-wine not
only to her parents and immediate relatives but to the wide and
extensive group of kinsmen called umunna. everybody had been
invited—men, women and children. but it was really a woman's
ceremony and the central figures were the bride and her mother.

as soon as day broke, breakfast was hastily eaten and women and
children began to gather at obierika's compound to help the bride's
mother in her difficult but happy task of cooking for a whole
village.

okonkwo's family was astir like any other family in the
neighborhood. nwoye's mother and okonkwo's youngest wife
were ready to set out for obierika's compound with all their
children. nwoye's mother carried a basket of coco-yams, a cake of
salt and smoked fish which she would present to obierika's wife.
okonkwo's youngest wife, ojiugo, also had a basket of plantains
and coco-yams and a small pot of palm-oil. their children carried
pots of water.

ekwefi was tired and sleepy from the exhausting experien

the previous night. it was not very long since they had returned.
the priestess, with ezinma sleeping on her back, had crawled out
of the shrine on her belly like a snake. she had not as much as





looked at okonkwo and ekwefi or shown any surprise at finding
them at the mouth of the cave. she looked straight ahead of her and
walked back to the village. okonkwo and his wife followed at a
respectful distance. they thought the priestess might be going to
her house, but she went to okonkwo's compound, passed through
his obi and into ekwefi's hut and walked into her bedroom. she
placed ezinma carefully on the bed and went away without saying
a word to anybody.

ezinma was still sleeping when everyone else was astir, and
ekwefi asked nwoye's mother and ojiugo to explain to obierika's
wife that she would be late. she had got ready her basket of coco-
yams and fish, but she must wait for ezinma to wake.

"you need some sleep yourself," said nwoye's mother. "you look
very tired."

as

. she went back to the hut and brought her pot.

"have you slept enough?" asked her mother.

"yes," she replied. "let us go."

"not before you have had your breakfast," said ekwefi. and she
went into her hut to warm the vegetable soup she had cooked last
night.

"we shall be going," said nwoye's mother. "i will tell obierika's
wife that you are coming later." and so they all went to help
obierika's wife—nwoye's mother with her four children and
ojiugo with her two.



as they trooped through okonkwo's obi he asked: "who will
prepare my afternoon meal?"



"i shall return to do it," said ojiugo.

okonkwo was also feeling tired, and sleepy, for although nobody
else knew it, he had not slept at all last night. he had felt very
anxious but did not show it. when ekwefi had followed the
priestess, he had allowed what he regarded as a reasonable and
manly interval to pass and then gone with his machete to the shrine,
where he thought they must be. it was only when he had got there
that it had occ

urred to him that the priestess might have chosen to
go round the villages first. okonkwo had returned home and sat
waiting. when he thought he had waited long enough he again
returned to the shrine. but the hills and the caves were as silent as
death. it was only on his fourth trip that he had found ekwefi, and
by then he had become gravely worried.

obierika's compound was as busy as an anthill. temporary
cooking tripods were erected on every available space by bringing
together three blocks of sun-dried earth and making a fire in their
midst. cooking pots went up and down the tri

 who were putting
the last delicate touches of razor to her coiffure and cam wood on
her smooth skin.



when the heat of the sun began to soften, obierika's son, maduka,
took a long broom and swept the ground in front of his father's obi.
and as if they had been waiting for that, obierika's relatives and
friends began to arrive, every man with his goatskin bag hung on
one shoulder and a rolled goatskin mat under his arm. some of
them were accompanied by their sons bearing carved wooden
stools. okonkwo was one of them. they sat in a half-circle and
began to talk of many things. it would not be long before the
suitors came.

okonkwo brought out his snuff-bottle and offered it to ogbuefi
ezenwa, who sat next to him. ezenwa took it, tapped it on his
kneecap, rubbed his left palm on his body to dry it before tipping a
little snuff into it. his actions were deliberate, and he spoke as he
performed them:

"1 hope our in-laws will bring many pots of wine. although they
come from a village that is kn
 
 ___________________________
 
own for being closefisted, they ought
to know that akueke is the bride for a king."

"they dare not bring fewer than thirty pots," said okonkwo. "i
shall tell them my mind if they do."

at that moment obierika's son, maduka, led out the giant goat
from the inner compound, for his father's relatives to see. they all
admired it and said that that was the way things should be done.
the goat was then led back to the inner compound.





very soon after, the in-laws began to arrive. young men and boys
in single file, each carrying a pot of wine, came first. obierika's
relatives counted the pots as they came. twenty, twenty-five.

"ee-e-e!"

the oldest man in the camp of the visitors replied: "it will be good
for you and it will be good for us."

"ee-e-e!"

"this is not the first time my people have come to marry your
daughter. my mother was one of you."



"ee-e-e!"



"and this will not be the last, because you understand us and we
understand you. you are a great family."

"ee-e-e!"

"prosperous men and great warriors." he looked in the direction of
okonkwo. "your daughter will bear us sons like you.

"ee-e-e!"

the kola was eaten and the drinking of palm-wine began. groups
of four or five men sat round with a pot in their midst. as the
evening wore on, food was presented to the guests. there were
huge bowls of foo-foo and steaming pots of soup. there were also
pots of yam pottage. it was a great feast.

as night fell, burning torches were set on wooden tripods and the
young men raised a song. the elders sat in a big circle and the
singers went ro

und singing each man's praise as they came before
him. they had something to say for every man. some were great
farmers, some were orators who spoke for the clan. okonkwo was
the greatest wrestler and warrior alive. when they had gone round
the circle they settled down in the center, and girls came from the
inner compound to dance. at first the bride was not among them.
but when she finally appeared holding a cock in her right hand, a
loud cheer rose from the crowd. all the other dancers made way
for her. she presented the cock to the musicians and began to
dance. her brass anklets rattled as she danced and her body
gleamed with cam wood in the soft yellow light

instruments went from song to
song. and they were all gay. they sang the latest song in the
village:

" if i hold her hand



she says, 'don't touch!'  if i hold her foot

she says, 'don't touch!'



but when i hold her waist-beads she pretends not to know."

the night was already far spent when the guests rose to go, taking
their bride home to spend seven market weeks with her suitor's
family. they sang songs as they went, and on their way they paid
short courtesy visits to prominent men like okonkwo, before they
finally left for their village. okonkwo made a present of two cocks
to them.

go-di-di-go-go-di-go. di-go-go-di-go. it was the ekwe talking to
the clan. one of the things every man learned was the language of
the hollowed-out wooden instrument. dum! dum! dum! boomed
the cannon at intervals.

the first cock had not crowed, and umuofia was still swallowed
up in sleep and silence when the ekwe began to talk, and the
cannon shattered the silence. men stirred on their

 again the cannon boomed. the wailing of the women would
not be heard beyond the village, but the ekwe carried the news to
all the nine villages and even beyond. it began by naming the clan:
umuofia obodo dike! "the land of the brave." umuofia obodo dike!
umuofia obodo dike! it said this over and over again, and as it





dwelt on it, anxiety mounted in every heart that heaved on a
bamboo bed that night. then it went nearer and named the village:
" iguedo of the yellow grinding-stone!" it was okonkwo's village.
again and again iguedo was called and men waited breathlessly in
all the nine villages. at last the man was named and people sighed
"e-u-u, ezeudu is dead." a cold shiver ran down okonkwo's back
as he remembered the last time the old man had visited him. "that
boy calls you father," he had said. "bear no hand in his death."

ezeudu was a great man, and so all the clan was at his funeral. the
ancient drums of death beat, guns and cannon were fired, and men
dashed about in frenzy, cutt

e dancing began again
and reached fever-heat. darkness was around the corner, and the
burial was near. guns fired the last salute and the cannon rent the
sky. and then from the center of the delirious fury came a cry of
agony and shouts of horror. it was as if a spell had been cast. all
was silent. in the center of the crowd a boy lay in a pool of blood.
it was the dead man's sixteen-year-old son, who with his brothers
and half-brothers had been dancing the traditional farewell to their
father. okonkwo's gun had exploded and a piece of iron had
pierced the boy's heart.

the confusion that followed was without parallel in the tradition of
umuofia. violent deaths were frequent, but nothing like this had
ever happened.

the only course open to okonkwo was to flee from the clan. it was
a crime against the earth goddess to kill a clansman, and a man
who committed it must flee from the land. the crime was of two
kinds, male and female. okonkwo had committed the female,
because it had been inadverte

nt. he could return to the clan after
seven years.

that night he collected his most valuable belongings into head-
loads. his wives wept bitterly and their children wept with them



without knowing why. obierika and half a dozen other friends
came to help and to console him. they each made nine or ten trips
carrying okonkwo's yams to store in obierika's barn. and before
the cock crowed okonkwo and his family were fleeing to his
motherland. it was a little village called mbanta, just beyond the
borders of mbaino.



as soon as the day broke, a large crowd of men from ezeudu's
quarter stormed okonkwo's compound, dressed in garbs of war.
they set fire to his houses, demolished his red walls, killed his
animals and destroyed his barn. it was the justice of the earth
goddess, and they were merely her messengers. they had no hatred
in their hearts against okonkwo. his greatest friend, obie

rika, was
among them. they were merely cleansing the land which
okonkwo had polluted with the blood of a clansman.

obierika was a man who thought about things. when the will of
the goddess had been done, he sat down in his obi and mourned his
friend's calamity. why should a man suffer so grievously for an
offense he had committed inadvertently? but although he thought
for a long time he found no answer. he was merely led into greater
complexities. he remembered his wife's twin children, whom he
had thrown away. what crime had they committed? the earth had
decreed 
 
 ___________________________
 
that they were an offense on the land and must be
destroyed. and if the clan did not exact punishment for an offense
against the great goddess, her wrath was loosed on all the land and
not just on the offender. as the elders said, if one finger brought
oil it soiled the others.





part two

chapter fourteen





okonkwo was well received by his mother's kinsmen in mbanta.
the old man who received him was his mother's younger brother,
who was now the eldest surviving member of that family. his
name was uchendu, and it was he who had received okonkwo's
mother twenty and ten years before when she had been brought
home irom umuofia to be buried with her people. okonkwo was
only a boy then and uchendu still remembered him crying the
traditional farewell: "mother, mother, mother is going."

that was many years ago. 
 
 ___________________________
 
today okonkwo was not bringing his
mother home to be buried with her people. he was taking his
family of three wives and their children to seek refuge in his
motherland. as soon as uchendu saw him with his sad and weary
company he guessed what had happened, and asked no questions.
it was not until the following day that okonkwo told him the full
story. the old man listened silently to the end and then said with
some relief: "it is a female ochu." and he arranged the requisite
rites and sacrifices.

okonkwo was given a plot of ground on which to build his
compound, and two or three pieces of land on which to

farm during the coming planting season. with the help of his
mother's kinsmen he built himself an obi and three huts for his
wives. he then installed his personal god and the symbols of his
departed fathers. each

they were hard and painful on the body as they fell, yet young
people ran about happily picking up the cold nuts and throwing
them into their mouths to melt.

the earth quickly came to life and the birds in the forests fluttered
around and chirped merrily. a vague scent of life and green
vegetation was diffused in the air. as the rain began to fall more
soberly and in smaller liquid drops, children sought for shelter, and
all were happy, refreshed and thankful.

okonkwo and his family worked very hard to plant a new farm.
but it was like beginning life anew without the vigor and
enthusiasm of youth, like learning to become left-handed in old
age. work no longer had for him the pleasure it used to have, and
when there was no work to do he sat in a silent half-sleep.

his life had been ruled by a great passion—to become one of the
lords of the clan. that had been his life-spring. and he had all but
achieved it. then everything had been broken. he had been cast

out of his clan like a fish onto a dry, sandy beach, panting. clearly
his personal god or chi was not made for great things. a man could
not rise beyond the destiny of his chi. the saying of the elders was
not true—that if a man said yea his chi also affirmed. here was a
man whose chi said nay despite his own affirmation.

the old man, uchendu, saw clearly that okonkwo had yielded to
despair and he was greatly troubled. he would speak to him after
the isa-ifi ceremony.



the youngest of uchendu's five sons, amikwu, was marrying a
new wife. the bride-price had been paid and all but the last
ceremony had been performed. amikwu and his people had taken
palm-wine to the bride's kinsmen about two moons before
okonkwo's arrival in mbanta. and so it was time for the final
ceremony of confession.



the daughters of the family were all there, some of them having
co
 
 ___________________________
 

"none," she answered.

"swear on this staff of my fathers," said uchendu

"i swear," said the bride.



uchendu took the hen from her, slit its throat with a sharp knife
and allowed some of the blood to fall on the ancestral staff.



from that day amikwu took the young bride and she became his
wife. the daughters of the clan did not return to their homes
immediately but spent two more days with their kinsmen.



on the second day uchendu called together his sons and daughters
and his nephew, okonkwo. the men brought their goatskin mats,
with which they sat on the floor, and the women sat on a sisal mat
spread on a raised bank of earth. uchendu pulled gently at his gray
beard and gnashed his teeth. then he began to speak, quietly and
deliberately, picking his words with great care:

"it is okonkwo that 1 primarily wish to speak to," he began. "but i
want all of you to note what 1 am going to say. i am an old man
and you are all children. 1 know more about the world than any of
you. if there
 
 ___________________________
 
 is any one among you who thinks he knows more let
him speak up." he paused, but no one spoke.

"why is okonkwo with us today? this is not his clan. we are only
his mother's kinsmen. he does not belong here. he is an exile,
condemned for seven years to live in a strange land. and so he is
bowed with grief. but there is just one question i would like to ask
him. can you tell me, okonkwo, why it is that one of the
commonest names we give our children is nneka, or "mother is
supreme?" we all know that a man is the head of the family and
his wives do his bidding. a child belongs to its father and his
family and not to its mother and her family. a man belongs to his
fatherland and not to his motherland. and yet we say nneka -
'mother is supreme.' why is that?"

there was silence. "1 want okonkwo to answer me," said uchendu.



"i do not know the answer," okonkwo replied.



"you 
 
 ___________________________
 
o not know the answer? so you see that you are a child.
you have many wives and many children—more children than i
have. you are a great man in your clan. but you are still a child,
my child. listen to me and i shall tell you. but there is one more
question i shall ask you. why is it that when a woman dies she is
taken home to be buried with her own kinsmen? she is not buried
with her husband's kinsmen. why is that? your mother was
brought home to me and buried with my people. why was that?"

okonkwo shook his head.

"he does not know that either," said uchendu, "and yet he is full of
sorrow because he has come to live in his motherland for a few
years." he laughed a mirthless laughter, and turned to his sons and
daughters. "what about you? can you answer my question?"

they all shook their heads.

"then listen to me," he said and cleared his throat. "it's true that a
child belongs to its father. but when a father beats his child, it
seeks sympathy in its mother's hut. a man belongs to his

 
 ___________________________
 
fatherland when things are good and life is sweet. but when there
is sorrow and bitterness he finds refuge in his motherland. your
mother is there to protect you. she is buried there. and that is why
we say that mother is supreme. is it right that you, okonkwo,
should bring to your mother a heavy face and refuse to be
comforted? be careful or you may displease the dead. your duty is
to comfort your wives and children and take them back to your
fatherland after seven years. but if you allow sorrow to weigh you
down and kill you they will all die in exile." he paused for a long
while. "these are now your kinsmen." he waved at his sons and
daughters.

left. do you know how many children i have
buried—children i begot in my youth and strength? twenty-two. i
did not hang myself, and i am still alive. if you think you are the
greatest sufferer in the world ask my daughter, akueni, how many
twins she has borne and thrown away. have you not heard the song
they sing when a woman dies?

"'for whom is it well, for whom is it well? there is no one for
whom it is well.'

 "i have no more to say to you."

chapter fifteen

it was in the second year of okonkwo's exile that his friend,
obierika, came to visit him.

he brought with him two young men, each of them carrying a
heavy bag on his head. okonkwo helped them put down their loads.
it was clear that the bags were full of cowries.

okonkwo was very happy to receive his friend. his wives and
children were very happy too, and so were his cousins and their
wives when he sent for them and told them who his guest was.

"you must take him to salute our father," said one of the cousins.

"yes," replied o

konkwo. "we are going directly." but before they
went he whispered something to his first wife. she nodded, and
soon the children were chasing one of their cocks.

uchendu had been told by one of his grandchildren that three
strangers had come to okonkwo's house. he was therefore waiting



to receive them. he held out his hands to them when they came
into his obi, and after they had shaken hands he asked okonkwo
who they were.

"this is obierika, my great friend. i have already spoken to you
about him."



"yes," said the old man, turning to obierika. "my son has told me
about you, and i am happy you have come to see us. i knew your
father, iweka. he was a great man. he had many friends here and
came to see them quite often. those were good days when a man
had friends in distant clans. your generation does not know that.

range to him nowadays." he looked at okonkwo.
"i am an old man and i like to talk. that is all i am good for now."
he got up painfully, went into an inner room and came back with a
kola nut.

"who are the young men with you?" he asked as he sat down again
on his goatskin. okonkwo told him.

"ah," he said. "welcome, my sons." he presented the kola nut to
them, and when they had seen it and thanked him, he broke it and
they ate.

"go into that room," he said to okonkwo, pointing with his finger.
"you will find a pot of wine there."

okonkwo brought the wine and they began to drink. it was a day
old, and very strong.

"yes," said uchendu after a long silence. "people traveled more in
those days. there is not a single clan in these parts that i do not
know very well. aninta, umuazu, ikeocha, elumelu, abame—i
know them all."



"have you heard," asked obierika, "that abame is no more?"



"how is that?" asked uchendu and okonkwo together.

"abame has been wip

s it not on an eke day that they fled into umuofia?" he asked
his two companions, and they nodded their heads.

"three moons ago," said obierika, "on an eke market day a little
band of fugitives came into our town. most of them were sons of
our land whose mothers had been buried with us. but there were
some too who came because they had friends in our town, and
others who could think of nowhere else open to escape. and so
they fled into umuofia with a woeful story." he drank his palm-
wine, and okonkwo filled his horn again. he continued:

"during the last planting season a white man had appeared in their
clan."

"an albino," suggested okonkwo.

"he was not an albino. he was quite different." he sipped his wine.
"and he was riding an iron horse. the first people who saw him
ran away, but he stood beckoning to them. in the end the fearless
ones went near and even touched him. the elders consulted their
oracle and it told them that the strange man would break their clan

said mother kite. 'there is something ominous behind the silence.'
and so daughter kite returned the duckling and took a chick
instead. 'what did the mother of this chick do?' asked the old kite.
'it cried and raved and cursed me,' said the young kite. 'then we
can eat the chick,' said her mother. 'there is nothing to fear from
someone who shouts.' those men of abame were fools."

"they were fools," said okonkwo after a pause. "they had been
warned that danger was ahead. they should have armed
themselves with their guns and their machetes even when they
went to market."

"they have paid for their foolishness," said obierika, "but i am
greatly afraid. we have heard stories about white men who made
the powerful guns and the strong drinks and took slaves away
across the seas, but no one thought the stories were true."

"there is no story that is not true," said uchendu. "the world has
no end, and what is 
 
 ___________________________
 
good among one people is an abomination with
others. we have albinos among us. do you not think that they
came to our clan by mistake, that they have strayed from their way
to a land where everybody is like them?"

okonkwo's first wife soon finished her cooking and set before their
guests a big meal of pounded yams and bitter-leaf soup.



okonkwo's son, nwoye, brought in a pot of sweet wine tapped
from the raffia palm.



"you are a big man now," obierika said to nwoye. "your friend
anene asked me to greet you."

"is he well?" asked nwoye.

"we are all well," said obierika.

ezinma brought them a bowl of water with which to wash their
hands. after that they began to eat and to drink the wine.

"when did you set out from home?" asked okonkwo.

obierika. "but nweke did not appe

ar until it was quite light. never
make an early morning appointment with a man who has just
married a new wife." they all laughed.

"has nweke married a wife?" asked okonkwo.

"he has married okadigbo's second daughter," said obierika.

"that is very good," said okonkwo. "i do not blame you for not
hearing the cock crow."

when they had eaten, obierika pointed at the two heavy bags.

"that is the money from your yams," he said. "i sold the big ones
as soon as you left. later on i sold some of the seed-yams and gave
out others to sharecroppers. i shall do that every year until you
return. but 1 thought you would need the money now and so i
brought it. who knows what may happen tomorrow? perhaps
green men will come to our clan and shoot us."



"god will not pe

"i can tell you," said obierika. "kill one of your sons for



me.

"that will not be enough," said okonkwo.

"then kill yourself," said obierika.

"forgive me," said okonkwo, smiling. "i shall not talk about
thanking you any more."

chapter sixteen

when nearly two years later obierika paid another visit to his
friend in exile the circumstances were less happy. the missionaries
had come to umuofia. they had built their church there, won a
handful of converts and were already sending evangelists to the
surrounding towns and villages. that was a source of great sorrow
to the leaders of the clan, but many of them believed that the
strange faith and the white man's god

ld not last. none of his
converts was a man whose word was heeded in ihe assembly of the
people. none of them was a man of title. they were mostly the
kind of people that were called efulefu, worthless, empty men. the
imagery of an efulefu in the language of the clan was a man who
sold his machete and wore the sheath to battle. chielo, the priestess
of agbala, called the converts the excrement of the clan, and the
new faith was a mad dog that had come to eat it up.

what moved obierika to visit okonkwo was the sudden
appearance of the latter's son, nwoye, among the missionaries in
umuofia.



"what are you doing here?" obierika had asked when  after many
difficulties the missionaries had allowed him to speak to the boy.



"1 am one of them," replied nwoye.

"how is your father?" obierika asked, not knowing what else to
say.

"1 don't know. he is not my father," said nwoye, unhappily.

and so obierika went to mbanta to see his friend. and he found
that okonkwo did not wish to speak about nwo

 gay and
rollicking tunes of evangelism which had the power of plucking at
silent and dusty chords in the heart of an ibo man. the interpreter
explained each verse to the audience, some of whom now stood
enthralled. it was a story of brothers who lived in darkness and in
fear, ignorant of the love of god. it told of one sheep out on the
hills, away from the gates of god and from the tender shepherd's
care.

after the singing the interpreter spoke about the son of god whose
name was jesu kristi. okonkwo, who only stayed in the hope that
it might come to chasing the men out of the village or whipping
them, now said

"you told us with your own mouth that there was only one god.
now you talk about his son. he must have a wife, then." the
crowd agreed.

"i did not say he had a wife," said the interpreter, somewhat
lamely.

"your buttocks said he had a son," said the joker. "so he must have
a wife and all of them must have buttocks."



the missionary ignored him and went on to talk about the holy

trinity. at the end of it okonkwo was fully convinced that the
man was mad. he shrugged his shoulders and went away to tap his
afternoon palm-wine.



but there was a young lad who had been captivated. his name was
nwoye, okonkwo's first son. it was not the mad logic of the
trinity that captivated him. he did not understand it. it was the
poetry of the new religion, something felt in the marrow. the
hymn about brothers who sat in darkness and in fear seemed to
answer a vague and persistent question that haunted his young
soul—the question of the twins crying in the bush and the question
of ikemefuna who was killed. he lelt a relief within as the hymn
poured into his parched soul. the words of the hymn were like the

more converts. and for the first time they had a woman. her name
was nneka, the wife of amadi, who was a prosperous farmer. she
was very heavy with child.

nneka had had four previous pregnancies and child-births. but
each time she had borne twins, and they had been immediately



thrown away. her husband and his family were already becoming
highly critical of such a woman and were not unduly perturbed
when they found she had fled to join the christians. it was a good
riddance.



one morning okonkwo's cousin, amikwu, was passing by the
church on his way from the neighboring village, when he saw
nwoye among the christians. he was greatly surprised, and when
he got home he went straight to okonkwo's hut and told him what
he had seen. the women began to talk excitedly, but okonkwo sat
unmoved.

it was late afternoon before nwoye returned. he went into the obi
and saluted his father, but he did not answer. nwoye turned round
to walk into the inner compound when his father, suddenly
overcome wi
 
 ___________________________
 
th fury, sprang to his feet and gripped him by the neck.

"where have you been?" he stammered.

nwoye struggled to free himself from the choking grip.

"answer me," roared okonkwo, "before i kill you!" he seized a
heavy stick that lay on the dwarf wall and hit him two or three
savage blows.

"answer me!" he roared again. nwoye stood looking at him and
did not say a word. the women were screaming outside, afraid to
go in.

"leave that boy at once!" said a voice in the outer compound. it
was okonkwo's uncle, uchendu. "are you mad?"

okonkwo did not answer. but he left hold of nwoye, who walked
away and never returned.




he went back to the church and told mr. kiaga that he had decided
to go to umuofia where the white missionary had set up a school
to teach young christians to read and write.

mr. kiaga's joy was very great. "blessed is he who forsakes his
father and his mother for my sake," he intoned. "those that hear
my words are my father and my mother."

nwoye did not fully understa
 
 ___________________________
 
nd. but he was happy to leave his
father. he would return later to his mother and his brothers and
sisters and convert them to the new faith.

as okonkwo sat in his hut that night, gazing into a log fire, he
thought over the matter. a sudden fury rose within him and he felt
a strong desire to take up his machete, go to the church and wipe
out the entire vile and miscreant gang. but on further thought he
told himself that nwoye was not worth fighting for. why, he cried
in his heart, should he, okonkwo, of all people, be cursed with
such a son? he saw clearly in it the finger of his personal god or
chi. for how else could he explain his great misfortune and exile
and now his despicable son's behavior? now that he had time to
think of it, his son's crime stood out in its stark enormity. to
abandon the gods of one's father and go about with a lot of
effeminate men clucking like old hens was the very depth of
abomination. suppose when he died all his male children decided
to follow nwoye's steps
 
 ___________________________
 
 and abandon their ancestors? okonkwo
felt a cold shudder run through him at the terrible prospect, like the
prospect of annihilation. he saw himself and his fathers crowding
round their ancestral shrine waiting in vain for worship and
sacrifice and finding nothing but ashes of bygone days, and his
children the while praying to the white man's god. if such a thing
were ever to happen, he, okonkwo, would wipe them off the face
of the earth.





okonkwo was popularly called the "roaring flame." as he looked
into the log fire he recalled the name. he was a flaming fire. how
then could he have begotten a son like nwoye, degenerate and
effeminate? perhaps he was not his son. no! he could not be. his
wife had played him false. he would teach her! but nwoye
resembled his grandfather, unoka, who was okonkwo's father. he
pushed the thought out of his mind. he, okonkwo, was called a
flaming fire. how could he have begotten a woman for a son? at
nwoye'

s age okonkwo had already become famous throughout
umuofia for his wrestling and his fearlessness.

he sighed heavily, and as if in sympathy the smoldering log also
sighed. and immediately okonkwo's eyes were opened and he saw
the whole matter clearly. living fire begets cold, impotent ash. he
sighed again, deeply.

chapter eighteen

the young church in mbanta had a few crises early in its life. at
first the clan had assumed that it would not survive. but it had
gone on living and gradually becoming stronger. the clan was
worried, but not overmuch. if a gang of efulefu decided to live in
the evil forest it was their own affair. when one came to think of
it, the evil forest was a fit home
 
 ___________________________
 
as was done for
a great man. no punishment was prescribed for a man who killed
the python knowingly. nobody thought that such a thing could
ever happen.

perhaps it never did happen. that was the way the clan at first
looked at it. no one had actually seen the man do it. the story had
arisen among the christians themselves.



but, all the same, the rulers and elders of mbanta assembled to
decide on their action. many of them spoke at great length and in
fury. the spirit of wars was upon them. okonkwo, who had begun
to play a part in the affairs of his motherland, said that until the
abominable gang was chased out of the village with whips there
would be no peace.



but there were many others who saw the situation differently, and
it was their counsel that prevailed in the end.

"it is not our custom to fight for our gods," said one of them. "let
us not presume to do so now. if a man kills the sacred python in
the secrecy of his hut, the matter lies between him and the god. we
did not see i

t. if we put ourselves between the god and his victim
we may receive blows intended for the offender. when a man
blasphemes, what do we do? do we go and stop his mouth? no.
we put our fingers into our ears to stop us hearing. that is a wise
action."

"let us not reason like cowards," said okonkwo. "if a man comes
into my hut and defecates on the floor, what do i do? do i shut my
eyes? no! i take a stick and break his head that is what a man
does. these people are daily pouring filth over us, and okeke says
we should pretend not to see." okonkwo made a sound full of
disgust. this was a womanly clan, he thought. such a thing could
never happen in his fatherland, umuofia.

"okonkwo has spoken the truth," said another man. "we should do
something. but let us ostracize these men. we would th
 
 ___________________________
 
en not be
held accountable for their abominations."

everybody in the assembly spoke, and in the end it was decided to
ostracize the christians. okonkwo ground his teeth in disgust.



that night a bell-man went through the length and breadth of
mbanta proclaiming that the adherents of the new faith were
thenceforth excluded from the life and privileges of the clan.



the christians had grown in number and were now a small
community of men, women and children, self-assured and
confident. mr. brown, the white missionary, paid regular visits to
them. "when i think that it is only eighteen months since the seed
was first sown among you," he said
 
 ___________________________
 
dead. his death showed that
the gods were still able to fight their own battles. the clan saw no
reason then for molesting the christians.

chapter nineteen

the last big rains of the year were falling. it was the time for
treading red earth with which to build walls. it was not done earlier
because the rains were too heavy and would have washed away the
heap of trodden earth, and it could not be done later because
harvesting would soon set in, and after that the dry season.

it was going to be okonkwo's last harvest in mbanta. the seven
wasted and weary years were at last dragging to a close. although
he had prospered in his motherland okonkwo knew that he would
have prospered even more in umuofia, in the land of his fathers
where men were bold and warlike. in these seven years he would



have climbed to the utmost heights. and so he regretted every day
of his exile. his mother's kinsmen had been very kind to him, and
he was grateful. but that did not alter the facts. he had called the
fir
 
 ___________________________
 
st child born to him in exile nneka—"mother is supreme"—out
of politeness to his mother's kinsmen. but two years later when a
son was born he called him nwofia—"begotten in the
wilderness."



as soon as he entered his last year in exile okonkwo sent money
to obierika to build him two huts in his old compound where he
and his family would live until he built more huts and the outside
wall of his compound. he could not ask another man to build his
own obi for him, nor the walls of his compound. those things a
man built for himself or inherited from his father.

as the last heavy rains of the year began to fall, obierika sent word
that the two huts had been built and okonkwo began to prepare for
his return, after the rains. he would have
 
 ___________________________
 
 full penalty of seven
years. and that could not be. so he waited impatiently for the dry
season to come.

it came slowly. the rain became lighter and lighter until it fell in
slanting showers. sometimes the sun shone through the rain and a
light breeze blew. it was a gay and airy kind of rain. the rainbow
began to appear, and sometimes two rainbows, like a mother and
her daughter, the one young and beautiful, and the other an old and
faint shadow. the rainbow was called the python of the sky.

okonkwo called his three wives and told them to get things
together for a great feast. "i must thank my mother's kinsmen
before i go," he said.

ekwefi still had some cassava left on her farm from the previous
year. neither of the other wives had. it was not that they had been



lazy, but that they had many children to feed. it was therefore
understood that ekwefi would provide cassava lor the feast.
nwoye's mother and ojiugo would provide the  other things like
smoked fish, palm-oil and pepper for t
 
 ___________________________
 
he soup. okonkwo would
take care of meat and yams.



ekwefi rose early on the following morning and went to her farm
with her daughter, ezinma, and ojiugo's daughter, obiageli, to
harvest cassava tubers. each of them carried a long cane basket, a
machete for cutting down the soft cassava stem, and a little hoe for
digging out the tuber. fortunately, a light rain had fallen during the
night and the soil would not be very hard.

"it will not take us long to harvest as much as we like," said
ekwefi.

"but the lea

to dig.
they just pulled the stump, and earth rose, roots snapped below,
and the tuber was pulled out.

when they had harvested a sizable heap they carried it down in
two trips to the stream, where every woman had a shallow well for
fermenting her cassava.

"it should be ready in four days or even three," said obiageli.
"they are young tubers."



"they are not all that young," said ekwefi. "i planted the farm
nearly two years ago. it is a poor soil and that is why the tubers are
so small."



okonkwo never did things by halves. when his wife ekwefi
protested that two goats were sufficient for the feast he told her
that it was not her affair.

"i am calling a feast because i have the wherewithal. i cannot live
on the bank of a river and wash my hands with spittle. my mother's
people have been good to me and 1 must show my gratitude."

and so three goats were slaughtered and a number of fowls. it was
like a wedding feast. there was foo-foo and yam pottage, egusi
soup and bitter-leaf soup and 
 
 ___________________________
 
pots and pots of palm-wine.

all the umunna were invited to the feast, all the descendants of
okolo, who had lived about two hundred years before. the oldest
member of this extensive family was okonkwo's uncle, uchendu.
the kola nut was given him to break, and he prayed to the
ancestors. he asked them for health and children. "we do not ask
for wealth because he that has health and children will also have
wealth. we do not pray to have more money but to have more
kinsmen. we are better than animals because we have kinsmen. an
animal rubs its itching flank against a tree, a man asks his kinsman
to scratch him." he prayed especially for okonkwo and his family.
he then broke the kola nut and thr

ew one of the lobes on the
ground for the ancestors.

as the broken kola nuts were passed round, okonkwo's wives and
children and those who came to help them with the cooking began
to bring out the food. his sons brought out the pots of palm-wine.
there was so much food and drink that many kinsmen whistled in
surprise. when all was laid out, okonkwo rose to speak.



"i beg you to accept this little kola," he said. "it is not to pay you
back for all you did for me in these seven years. a child cannot
pay for its mother's milk. i have only called you together because it
is good for kinsmen to meet."



yam pottage was served first because it was lighter than foo-foo
and because yam always came first. then the foo-foo was served.
some kinsmen ate it with egusi soup and others with bitter-leaf
soup. the meat was then shared so that every mem
 
 ___________________________
 
ber of the
umunna had a portion. every man rose in order of years and took a
share. even the few kinsmen who had not been able to come had
their shares taken out for them in due term.

as the palm-wine was drunk one of the oldest members of the
umunna rose to thank okonkwo:

"if i say that we did not expect such a big feast i will be suggesting
that we did not know how openhanded our son, okonkwo, is. we
all know him, and we expected a big feast. but it turned out to be
even bigger than we expected. thank you. may all you took out
return again tenfold. it is good in these days when the younger
generation consider themselves wiser than their sires to see a man
doing things in the grand, old way. a man who calls his kinsmen
to a feast does not do so to save them from starving. they all have
food in their own homes. when we gather together in the moonlit
village ground it is not because of

, and so have uchendu and
unachukwu and emefo. but i fear for you young people because
you do not understand how strong is the bond of kinship. you do
not know what it is to speak with one voice. and what is the result?
an abominable religion has settled among you. a man can now



leave his father and his brothers. he can curse the gods of his
fathers and his ancestors, like a hunter's dog that suddenly goes
mad and turns on his master. i fear for you, i fear for the clan." he
turned again to okonkwo and said, "thank you for calling us
together."



chapter twenty

seven years was a long time to be away from one's clan. a man's
place was not always there, waiting for him. as soon as he left,
someone else rose and filled it. the clan was like a lizard, if it lost
its tail it soon grew another.

okonkwo knew these things. he knew that he had lost his place
among the nine masked spirits who administered justice in the clan.
he had lost the chance to lead his warlike clan against the new
religi
 
 ___________________________
 
is return should be marked by his people. he would return
with a flourish, and regain the seven wasted years.

even in his first year in exile he had begun to plan for his return.
the first thing he would do would be to rebuild his compound on a
more magnificent scale. he would build a bigger barn than he had
had before and he would build huts for two new wives. then he
would show his wealth by initiating his sons into the ozo society.
only the really great men in the clan were able to do this.
okonkwo saw clearly the high esteem in which he would be held,
and he saw himself taking the highest title in the land.

as the years of exile passed one by one it seemed to him that his
chi might now be making amends for the past disaster. his yams
grew abundantly, not only in his motherland but also in umuofia,
where his friend gave them out year by year to sharecroppers.



then the tragedy of his first son had occurred. at first it appeared
as if it might prove too great for his spirit. but it was
 
 ___________________________
 
 a resilient
spirit, and in the end okonkwo overcame his sorrow. he had five
other sons and he would bring them up in the way of the clan.



he sent for the five sons and they came and sat in his obi. the
youngest of them was four years old.

"you have all seen the great abomination of your brother. now he
is no longer my son or your brother. i will only have a son who is a
man, who will hold his head up among my people. if any one of
you prefers to be a woman, let him follow nwoye now while i am
alive so that i can curse him. if you tu

rn against me when i am
dead i will visit you and break your neck."

okonkwo was very lucky in his daughters. he never stopped
regretting that ezinma was a girl. of all his children she alone
understood his every mood. a bond of sympathy had grown
between them as the years had passed.

ezinma grew up in her father's exile and became one of the most
beautiful girls in mbanta. she was called crystal of beauty, as her
mother had been called in her youth. the young ailing girl who
had caused her mother so much heartache had been transformed,
almost overnight, into a healthy
 
 ___________________________
 
her person
but her father.

many young men and prosperous middle-aged men of mbanta
came to marry her. but she refused them all, because her father had
called her one evening and said to her: "there are many good and
prosperous people here, but i shall be happy if you marry in
umuofia when we return home."



that was all he had said. but ezinma had seen clearly all the
thought and hidden meaning behind the few words. and she had
agreed.



"your half-sister, obiageli, will not understand me," okonkwo
said. "but you can explain to her."

although they were almost the same age, ezinma wielded a strong
influence over her half-sister. she explained to her why they
should not marry yet, and she agreed also. and so the two of them
refused every offer of marriage in mbanta.

"i wish she were a boy," okonkwo thought within himself. she
understood things so perfectly. who else among his children could
have read his thoughts so well? with two beautiful grown-up
daughters his return to umuofia would a
 
 ___________________________
 
ttract considerable
attention. his future sons-in-law would be men of authority in the
clan. the poor and unknown would not dare to come forth.

umuofia had indeed changed during the seven years okonkwo had
been in exile. the church had come and led many astray. not only
the low-born and the outcast but sometimes a worthy man had
joined it. such a man was ogbuefi ugonna, who had taken two
titles, and who like a madman had cut the anklet of his titles and
cast it away to join the christians. the white missionary was very
proud of him and he was one of the first men in umuofia to receive
the sacrament of holy communion, or holy feast as it was called
in ibo. ogbuefi ugonna had thought of the fea
 
 ___________________________
 
t
messengers. some of these prisoners were men of title who should
be above such mean occupation. they were grieved by the
indignity and mourned for their neglected farms. as they cut grass
in the morning the younger men sang in time with the strokes of
their machetes:

"kotma of the ashy buttocks,

he is fit to be a slave. the white man has no sense,

he is fit to be a slave."

the court messengers did not like to be called ashy-buttocks, and
they beat the men. but the song spread in umuofia.

okonkwo's head was bowed in sadness as obierika told him these
things.

"perhaps i have been away too long," okonkwo said, almost to
himself. "but i cannot understand these things you tell me. what is
it that has happened to our people? why have they lost the power
to fight?"




"have you not heard how the white man wiped out abame?" asked
obierika.

"i have heard," said okonkwo. "but i have also heard that abame
people were weak and foolish. why did they not fight back? had
they no guns and machetes
 
 ___________________________
 
they have joined his
religion and they help to uphold his government. if we should try
to drive out the white men in umuofia we should find it easy.
there are only two of them. but what of our own people who are
following their way and have been given power? they would go to
umuru and bring the soldiers, and we would be like abame." he
paused for a long time and then said: "i told you on my last visit to
mbanta how they hanged aneto."

"what has happened to that piece of land in dispute?" asked
okonkwo.

"the white man's court has decided that it should belong to
nnama's family, who had given much money to the white man's
messengers and interpreter."

"does the white man understand our custom about land?"

"how can he when he does not even speak our tongue? but he says
that our customs are bad, and our own brothers who have taken up
his religion also say that our customs are bad. how do you think
we can fight when our own brothers have turned against us? the
white man is very clever. he came 
 
 ___________________________
 
quietly and peaceably with his
religion. we were amused at his foolishness and allowed him to
stay. now he has won our brothers, and our clan can no longer act



like one. he has put a knife on the things that held us together and
we have fallen apart."



"how did they get hold of ancto to hang him?" asked okonkwo.

"when he killed oduche in the fight over the land, he fled to
aninta to escape the wrath of the earth. this was about eight days
after the fight, because oduche had not died immediately from his
wounds. it was on the seventh day that he died. but everybody
knew that he was going to die and aneto got his belongings
together in readiness to flee. but the christians had told the white
man about the accident, and he sent his kotma to catch aneto. he
was imprisoned with all the leaders of his fami
 
 ___________________________
 
ly. in the end
oduche died and aneto was taken to umuru and hanged. the other
people were released, but even now they have not found the mouth
with which to tell of their suffering."

the two men sat in silence for a long while afterwards.

chapter twenty-one

there were many men and women in umuofia who did not feel as
strongly as okonkwo about the new dispensation. the white man
had indeed brought a lunatic religion, but he had also built a
trading store and for the first time palm-oil and kernel became
things of great price, and much money flowed into umuofia.

and even in the matter of religion there was a growing feeling that
there might be something in it after all, something vaguely akin to
method in the overwhelming madness.

this growing feeling was due to mr. brown, the white missionary,
who was very firm in restraining
 
 ___________________________
 
ord's vineyard. new churches were established in
the surrounding villages and a few schools with them. from the
very beginning religion and education went hand in hand. mr.



brown's mission grew from strength to strength, and because of its
link with the new administration it earned a new social prestige.
but mr. brown himself was breaking down in health. at first he
ignored the warning signs. but in the end he had to leave his flock,
sad and broken.



it was in the first rainy season after okonkwo's return to umuofia
that mr. brown left for home. as soon as he had learned of
okonkwo's return five months earlier, the missionary had
immediately paid him a visit. he had just sent okonkwo's son,
nwoye, who was now called isaac, to the new training college for
teachers in umuru. and he had hoped that okonkwo would be
happy to hear of it. but okonkwo had driven him away with the
threat that if he came into his compound again, he would be carried
out of it.

okonkwo's return to his native land 
 
 ___________________________
 
est among suitors and marriage negotiations were soon in
progress, but, beyond that, umuofia did not appear to have taken
any special notice of the warrior's return. the clan had undergone
such profound change during his exile that it was barely
recognizable. the new religion and government and the trading
stores were very much in the people's eyes and minds. there were
still many who saw these new institutions as evil, but even they
talked and thought about little else, and certainly not about
okonkwo's return.

and it was the wrong year too. if okonkwo had immediately
initiated his two sons into the ozo society as he had planned he
would have caused a stir. but the initiation rite was performed
once in three years in umuofia, and he had to wait for nearly two
years for the next round of ceremonies.



okonkwo was deeply grieved. and it was not just a personal grief.
he mourned for the clan, which he saw breaking up and falling
apart, and he mourned for the warlike men of umuofia, who had s

mr. smith stood his ground. but he could not save his church.
when the egwugwu went away the red-earth church which mr.
brown had built was a pile of earth and ashes. and for the moment
the spirit of the clan was pacified.

chapter twenty-three

for the first time in many years okonkwo had a feeling that was
akin to happiness. the times which had altered so unaccountably
during his exile seemed to be coming round again. the clan which
had turned false on him appeared to be making amends.

he had spoken violently to his clansmen when they had met in the
marketplace to decide on their action. and they had listened to him
with respect. it was like the good old days again, when a warrior
was a warrior. although they had not agreed to kill the missionary
or drive away the christia

ns, they had agreed to do something
substantial. and they had done it. okonkwo was almost happy
again.




for two days after the destruction of the church, nothing happened.
every man in umuofia went about armed with a gun or a machete.
they would not be caught unawares, like the men of abame.

then the district commissioner returned from his tour. mr. smith
went immediately to him and they had a long discussion. the men
of umuofia did not take any notice of this, and if they did, they
thought it was not important. the missionary often went to see his
brother white man.

 there was nothing strange in that.

three days later the district commissioner sent his sweet-tongued
messenger to the leaders of umuofia asking them to meet him in
his headquarters. that also was not strange. he often asked them to
hold such palavers, as he called them. okonkwo was among the six
leaders he invited.

okonkwo warned the others to be fully armed. "an umuofia man
does not refuse a call," he said. "he may refuse to do what he is
asked, he does not refuse to be asked. but the times have changed,
and we must be fully prepared."

and so the six men went to see the district commissioner, armed
with their machetes. they did not carry guns, for that would be
unseemly. they were led into the courthouse where the district
commissioner sat. he received them politely. they unslung their
goatskin bags and their s

the next. they
were not even given any water to drink, and they could not go out
to urinate or go into the bush when they were pressed. at night the
messengers came in to taunt them and to knock their shaven heads
together.

even when the men were left alone they found no words to speak
to one another. it was only on the third day, when they could no
longer bear the hunger and the insults, that they began to talk about
giving in.

"we should have killed the white man if you had listened to me,"
okonkwo snarled.

"we could have been in umuru now waiting to be hanged,"
someone said to him.

"who wants to kill the white man?" asked a messenger who had
just rushed in. nobody spoke.

"you are not satisfied with your crime, but you must kill the white
man on top of it." he carried a strong stick, and he hit each man a
few blows on the head and back. okonkwo was choked with hate.

as soon as the six men were locked up, court messengers went into
umuofia to tell the people that their leaders would

ge paths as they went to visit their friends and lovers. umuofia
was like a startled animal with ears erect, sniffing the silent,
ominous air and not knowing which way to run.

the silence was broken by the village crier beating his sonorous
ogene. he called every man in umuofia, from the akakanma age
group upwards, to a meeting in the marketplace after the morning
meal. he went from one end of the village to the other and walked
all its breadth. he did not leave out any of the main footpaths.

okonkwo's compound was like a deserted homestead. it was as if
cold water had been poured on it. his family was all there, but
everyone spoke in whispers. his daughter ezinma had broken her
twenty-eight day visit to the family of her future husband, and
returned home when she heard that her father had been imprisoned,
and was going to be hanged. as soon as she got home she went to




obierika to ask what the men of umuofia were going to do about it.
but obierika had not been home since morning. his w

ives thought
he had gone to a secret meeting. ezinma was satisfied that
something was being done.

on the morning after the village crier's appeal the men of umuofia
met in the marketplace and decided to collect without delay two
hundred and fifty bags of cowries to appease the white man. they
did not know that fifty bags would go to the court messengers, who
had increased the fine for that purpose.

chapter twenty-four

okonkwo and his fellow prisoners were set free as soon as the fine
was paid. the district commissioner spoke to them again about
the great queen, and about peace and good government. but the
men did not listen. they just sat and looked at him and at his
interpreter. in the end they were given back their bags and
sheathed machetes and told to go home. they rose and left the
courthouse. they neither spoke to anyone nor among themselves.
the courthouse, like the church, was built a little way outside the

 each of the six men got to his compound,
he turned in, taking some of the crowd with him. the village was
astir in a silent, suppressed way.



ezinma had prepared some food for her father as soon as news
spread that the six men would be released. she took it to him in his
obi. he ate absent-mindedly. he had no appetite, he only ate to
please her. his male relations and friends had gathered in his obi,
and obierika was urging him to eat. nobody else spoke, but they
noticed the long stripes on okonkwo's back where the warder's
whip had cut into his flesh.



the village crier was abroad again in the night. he beat his iron
gong and announced that another meeting would be held in the
morning. everyone knew that umuofia was at last going to speak
its mind about the things that were happening.

okonkwo slept very little that night. the bitterness in his heart was
now mixed with a kind of childlike excitement, before he had gone
to bed he had brought down his war dress, which he had not
touched

his bamboo bed he thought about the treatment he had
received in the white man's court, and he swore vengeance. if
umuofia decided on war, all would be well. but if they chose to be
cowards he would go out and avenge lümself. he thought about
wars in the past. the noblest, he thought, was the war against isike.
in those days okudo was still alive. okudo sang a war song in a
way that no other man could. he was not a fighter, but his voice
turned every man into a lion.

"worthy men are no more," okonkwo sighed as he remembered
those days. "isike will never forget how we slaughtered them in
that war. we killed twelve of their men and they killed only two of
ours. before the end of the fourth market week they were suing for
peace. those were days when men were men."



as he thought of these things he heard the sound of the iron gong
in the distance. he listened carefully, and could just hear the crier's
voice. but it was very faint. he turned on his bed and his back hurt
him. he ground his tee

th. the crier was drawing nearer and nearer
until he passed by okonkwo's compound.



"the greatest obstacle in umuofia," okonkwo thought bitterly, "is
that coward, egonwanne. his sweet tongue can change fire into
cold ash. when he speaks he moves our men to impotence. if they
had ignored his womanish wisdom five years ago, we would not
have come to this." he ground his teeth. "tomorrow he will tell
them that our fathers never fought a 'war of blame.' if they listen to
him i shall leave them and plan my own revenge."

the crier's voice had once more become faint, and the distance had
taken the harsh edge off his iron gong
 
 ___________________________
 
. okonkwo turned from one
side to the other and derived a kind of pleasure from the pain his
back gave him. "let egonwanne talk about a 'war of blame'
tomorrow and i shall show him my back and head." he ground his
teeth.

the marketplace began to fill as soon as the sun rose. obierika was
waiting in his obi when okonkwo came along and called him. he
hung his goatskin bag and his sheathed machete on his shoulder
and went out to join him. obierika's hut was close to the road and
he saw every man who passed to the marketplace. he had
exchanged greetings with many who had already passed that
morning.

when okonkwo and obierika got to the meeting place there were
already so many people that if one threw up a grain of sand it
would not find its way to the earth again. and many more people
were coming from every quar

ter of the nine villages. it warmed
okonkwo's heart to see such strength of numbers. but he was



looking for one man in particular, the man whose tongue he
dreaded and despised so much.



"can you see him?" he asked obierika.

"who?"

"egonwanne," he said, his eyes roving from one corner of the huge
marketplace to the other. most of the men sat on wooden stools
they had brought with them.

"no," said obierika, casting his eyes over the crowd. "yes, there
he is, under the silk-cotton tree. are you afraid he would convince
us not to fi

ght?"

"afraid? i do not care what he does to you. i despise him and those
who listen to him. i shall fight alone if i choose."

they spoke at the top of their voices because everybody was
talking, and it was like the sound of a great market.

"i shall wait till he has spoken," okonkwo thought. "then i shall
speak."

"but how do you know he will speak against war?" obierika asked
after a while.

"because i know he is a coward," said okonkwo. obierika did not
hear the rest of what he said because at that moment somebody
touched his shoulder from behind and he turned round to shake
hands and exchange greetings with five or six friends. okonkwo
did not turn round even though he knew the voices. he was in no
mood to exchange greetings. but one of the men touched him and
asked about the people of his compound.

"they are well," he replied without interest.



the first man to speak to umuofia that morning was okika, one of
the six who

brothers take the side of evil we must root them out too. and we
must do it now. we must bale this water now that it is only ankle-
deep…"

at this point there was a sudden stir in the crowd and every eye
was turned in one direction. there was a sharp bend in the road
that led from the marketplace to the white man's court, and to the
stream beyond it. and so no one had seen the approach of the five
court messengers until they had come round the bend, a few paces
from the edge of the crowd. okonkwo was sitting at the edge.

he sprang to his feet as soon as he saw who it was. he confronted
the head messenger, trembling with hate, unable to utter a word.
the man was fearless and stood his ground, his four men lined up
behind him.

in that brief moment the world seemed to stand still, waiting.
there was utter silence. the men of umuofia were merged into the
mute backcloth of trees and giant creepers, waiting.



the spell was broken by the head messenger. "let me pass!" he
ordered.



"what
 
 ___________________________
 
 do you want here?"

"the white man whose power you know too well has ordered this
meeting to stop."

in a flash okonkwo drew his machete. the messenger crouched to
avoid the blow. it was useless. okonkwo's machete descended
twice and the man's head lay beside his uniformed body.

the waiting backcloth jumped into tumultuous life and the meeting
was stopped. okonkwo stood looking at the dead man. he knew
that umuofia would not go to war. he knew because they had let
the other messengers escape. they had broken into tumult instead
of action. he discerned fright in that tumult. he heard voices
asking: "why did he do it?"

he wiped his machete on the sand and went away.

chapter twenty-five

when the district commissioner arrived at okonkwo's compound
at the head of an armed band of soldiers and court messengers he
found a small crowd of men sitting wearily i

n the obi. he
commanded them to come outside, and they obeyed without a
murmur.

"which among you is called okonkwo?" he asked through his
interpreter.

"he is not here," replied obierika.

"where is he?"

"he is not here!"



the commissioner became angry and red in the face. he warned
the men that unless they produced okonkwo forthwith he would
lock them all up. the men murmured among themselves, and
obierika spoke again.



"we can take you where he is, and perhaps your men will help us."

the commissioner did not understand what obierika meant when
he said, "perhaps your men will help us." one of the most
infuriating habits of these people was their love of superfluous
words, he thought.

obierika with five or six others led the way. the commissioner
and his men followed their firearms held at the ready. he had
wa

rned obierika that if he and his men played any monkey tricks
they would be shot. and so they went.

there was a small bush behind okonkwo's compound. the only
opening into this bush from the compound was a little round hole
in the red-earth wall through which fowls went in and out in their
endless search for food. the hole would not let a man through. it
was to this bush that obierika led the commissioner and his men.
they skirted round the compound, keeping close to the wall. the
only sound they made was with their feet as they crushed dry
leaves.

then they came to the tree from which okonkwo's body was
dangling, and they stopp
