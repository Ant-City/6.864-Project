[CHARACTER] - 
 for clarity's sake, this sparknote refers
to the daughter of edgar linton and the first catherine as "young
catherine." the first catherine begins her life as catherine earnshaw
and ends it as catherine linton; her daughter begins as catherine
linton and, assuming that she marries hareton after the
end of the story, goes on to become catherine earnshaw. the mother
and the daughter share not only a name, but also a tendency toward headstrong
behavior, impetuousness, and occasional arrogance. however, edgar's
influence seems to have tempered [CHARACTER]'s character,
and she is a gentler and more compassionate creature than her mother.
