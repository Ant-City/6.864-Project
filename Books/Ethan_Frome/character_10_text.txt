e was but the ruin of a man. it was not so much his great height that marked him, for the “natives” were easily singled out by their lank longitude from the stockier foreign breed: it was the careless powerful look he had, in spite of a lameness checking each step like the jerk of a chain. there was something bleak and unapproachable in his face, and he was so stiffened and grizzled that i took him for an old man and was surprised to hear that he was not more than fifty-two. i had this from harmon gow, who had driven the stage from bettsbridge to starkfield in pre-trolley days and knew the chronicle of all the families on his line.
“he’s looked that way ever since he had his smash-up; and that’s twenty-four years ago come next february,” harmon threw out between reminiscent pauses.
the “smash-up” it was—i gathered from the same informant—which, besides drawing the red gash across ethan frome’s forehead, had so shortened and warped his right side that it cost him a visible e

winters. most of the smart ones get away.”
“why didn’t he?”
“somebody had to stay and care for the folks. there warn’t ever anybody but ethan. fust his father—then his mother—then his wife.”
“and then the smash-up?”
harmon chuckled sardonically. “that’s so. he had to stay then.”
“i see. and since then they’ve had to care for him?”
harmon thoughtfully passed his tobacco to the other cheek. “oh, as to that: i guess it’s always ethan done the caring.”
though harmon gow developed the tale as far as his mental and moral reach permitted there were perceptible gaps between his facts, and i had the sense that the deeper meaning of the story was in the gaps. but one phrase stuck in my memory and served as the nucleus about which i grouped my subsequent inferences: “guess he’s been in starkfield too many winters.”
before my own time there was up i had learned to know what that meant. yet i had come in the degenerate day of trolley, bicycle and rural delivery,

 on the subject of ethan frome i found her unexpectedly reticent. there was no hint of disapproval in her reserve; i merely felt in her an insurmountable reluctance to speak of him or his affairs, a low “yes, i knew them both... it was awful...” seeming to be the utmost concession that her distress could make to my curiosity.
so marked was the change in her manner, such depths of sad initiation did it imply, that, with some doubts as to my delicacy, i put the case anew to my village oracle, harmon gow; but got for my pains only an uncomprehending grunt.
“ruth varnum was always as nervous as a rat; and, come to think of it, she was the first one to see ‘em after they was picked up. it happened right below lawyer varnum’s, down at the bend of the corbury road, just round about the time that ruth got engaged to ned hale. the young folks was all friends, and i guess she just can’t bear to talk about it. she’s had troubles enough of her own.”

of personal contact with the man.
on my arrival at starkfield, denis eady, the rich irish grocer, who was the proprietor of starkfield’s nearest approach to a livery stable, had entered into an agreement to send me over daily to corbury flats, where i had to pick up my train for the junction. but about the middle of the winter eady’s horses fell ill of a local epidemic. the illness spread to the other starkfield stables and for a day or two i was put to it to find a means of transport. then harmon gow suggested that ethan frome’s bay was still on his legs and that his owner might be glad to drive me over.
i stared at the suggestion. “ethan frome? but i’ve never even spoken to him. why on earth should he put himself out for me?”
harmon’s answer surprised me still more. “i don’t know as he would; but i know he wouldn’t be sorry to earn a dollar.”
i had been told that frome was poor, and that the saw-mill and the arid acres of his farm yielded scarcely enough to keep his house

 the questions i put, or such slight pleasantries as i ventured. he seemed a part of the mute melancholy landscape, an incarnation of its frozen woe, with all that was warm and sentient in him fast bound below the surface; but there was nothing unfriendly in his silence. i simply felt that he lived in a depth of moral isolation too remote for casual access, and i had the sense that his loneliness was not merely the result of his personal plight, tragic as i guessed that to be, but had in it, as harmon gow had hinted, the profound accumulated cold of many starkfield winters.
only once or twice was the distance between us bridged for a moment; and the glimpses thus gained confirmed my desire to know more. once i happened to speak of an engineering job i had been on the previous year in florida, and of the contrast between the winter landscape about us and that in which i had found myself the year before; and to my surprise frome said suddenly: “yes: i was down there once, and for a good while af

d was carried through to the flats.” he roused the lagging bay with another twitch; then, as if the mere sight of the house had let me too deeply into his confidence for any farther pretence of reserve, he went on slowly: “i’ve always set down the worst of mother’s trouble to that. when she got the rheumatism so bad she couldn’t move around she used to sit up there and watch the road by the hour; and one year, when they was six months mending the bettsbridge pike after the floods, and harmon gow had to bring his stage round this way, she picked up so that she used to get down to the gate most days to see him. but after the trains begun running nobody ever come by here to speak of, and mother never could get it through her head what had happened, and it preyed on her right along till she died.”
as we turned into the corbury road the snow began to fall again, cutting off our last glimpse of the house; and frome’s silence fell with it, letting down between us the old veil of reticence
