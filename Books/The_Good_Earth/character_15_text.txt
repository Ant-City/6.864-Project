it was wang lung's marriage day. at first,
opening his eyes in the blackness of the curtains about his
bed, he could not think why the dawn seemed different
from any other. the house was still except for the faint,
gasping cough of his old father, whose room was opposite
to his own across the middle room. every morning the old
man's cough was the first sound to be heard. wang lung
usually lay listening to it, and moved only when he heard
it approaching nearer and when he heard the door of his
father's room squeak upon its wooden hinges.

but this morning he did not wait. he sprang up and
pushed aside the curtains of his bed. it was a dark, ruddy
dawn, and through a small square hole of a window, where
the tattered paper fluttered, a glimpse of bronze sky
gleamed. he went to the hole and tore the paper away.

'it is spring and i do not need this,' he muttered.

he was ashamed to say aloud that he wished the house
to look neat on this day. the

through the gate there would be a woman walking behind
him.

he turned to the right within the gate and after a mo-,
ment was in the street of barbers. there were few before
him so early, only some farmers who had carried their pro-
duce into the town the night before in order that they
might sell their vegetables at the dawn markets and return
for the day's work in the fields. they had slept shivering
and crouching over their baskets, the baskets now empty at
their feet. wang lung avoided them lest some recognise
him, for he wanted none of their joking on this day. all
down the street in a long line the barbers stood behind
their small stalls, and wang lung went to the farthest one
and sat down upon the stool and motioned to the barber
who stood chattering to his neighbour. the barber came
at once and began quickly to pour hot water, from a kettle
on his pot of charcoal, into his brass basin.

dried lotus leaf, and then, hesitating, he bought- also six
ounces of beef. when all had been bought, even two fresh
squares of bean-curd, shivering in a jelly upon its leaf, he
went to a candlemaker's shop and there he bought a pair
of incense sticks. then he turned his steps with great shy-
ness toward the house of hwang.

once at the gate of the house he was seized with terror. ]
how had he come alone? he should have asked his father — '
his uncle — even his nearest neighbour, ching — any one to
come with him. he had never been in a great house before.
how could he go in with his wedding feast on his arm,
and say, 'i have come for a woman?'

he stood at the gate for a long time, looking at it. it

bound and studded with iron, closed upon each other.

emly. the woman answered in her plain
voice :

'i have been kitchen slave since i went into the house
of hwang. there were meats at every meal.'

wang lung nodded and left her, and did not see her
again until the guests came crowding in, his uncle jovial
and sly and hungry, his uncle's son an impudent lad of
fifteen, and the farmers clumsy and grinning with shyness.
two were men from the village, with whom wang lung
exchanged seed and labour at harvest-time, and one was
his next-door neighbour, ching, a small, quiet man, ever
unwilling to speak unless he were compelled to it. after
they had been seated about the middle room with demurring
and unwillingness to take seats, for politeness, wang lung
went into the kitchen to bid the woman serve. then he
was pleased when she said to him:

'i will hand you the bowls if you will place them upon
the table. i do not like to come out before men.'

wang lung felt in him a great pride that this woman
was his and did not fear to appear before him, but w

foolish body, which he had made to arise every 'morning
so early for all these years, would not sleep although it
could, and so he lay there, tasting and savouring in his
mind and in his flesh his luxury of idleness.

he was still half ashamed to think of this woman of
his. part of the time he thought of his fields and of the
grains of the wheat and of what his harvest would be if
the rains came and of the white turnip seed he wished to
buy from his neighbour ching if they could agree upon a
price. but between all these thoughts which were in his
mind every day there ran weaving and interweaving the
new thought of what his life now was, and it occurred to
him, suddenly, thinking of the night, to wonder if she liked
him. this was a new wonder. he had questioned only of
whether he would like her and whether or not she would
be satisfactory in his bed and in his house. plain though
her face was and rough the skin upon her hands, the flesh

and the cotton in the quilts that had grown hard and grey
from years she picked over, killing the vermin that had
flourished in the hidden folds, and sunning it all. day
after day she did one thing after another, until the three
rooms seemed clean and almost prosperous. the old man's
cough grew better and he sat in the sun by the southern
wall of the house, always half-asleep and warm and content.

but she never talked, this woman, except for the brief
necessities of life. wang lung, watching her move steadily
and slowly about the rooms on her big feet, watching
secretly the stolid, square face, the unexpressed, half-fearful
look of her eyes, made nothing of her. at night he knew
the soft firmness of her body. but in the day her clothes,
her plain blue cotton coat and trousers, covered all that he
knew, and she was like a faithful, speechless serving-maid,
who is only a serving-maid and nothing more. and it
was not meet that he should say to her, 'why do you not

he went up and for the moment there were no words
in his mouth. his heart crowded up into his breast and
he leaned over the child to look at it. it had a round,
wrinkled face that looked very dark, and upon its head
the hair was long and damp and black. it had ceased crying
and lay with its eyes tightly shut.

he looked at his wife and she looked back at him.
her hair was still wet with her agony and her narrow eyes
were sunken. beyond this she was as she always was.
but to him she was touching, lying there. his heart rushed
out to these two, and he said, not knowing what else there
was that could be said:

'to-morrow i will go into the city and buy a pound
of red sugar and stir it into boiling water for you to drink.'

and then, looking at the child again, this burst forth
from him suddenly as though he had just thought of it,
5we shall have to buy a good basketful of eggs and dye
them all red for the village. thus will every one know i
have a son!'

tective figures, sitting staidly under their small roof — what
a power they had!

and then, almost before one could realise anything,
the woman was back in the fields beside him. the harvests
were past, and the grain they beat out upon the threshing-
floor which was also the dooryard to the house. they beat
it out with flails, he and the woman together. and when
the grain was flailed they winnowed it, casting it up from
great flat bamboo baskets into the wind and catching the
good grain as it fell, and the chaff blew away in a cloud
with the wind. then there were the fields to plant for
winter wheat again, and when he had yoked the ox and
ploughed the land the woman followed behind with her
hoe and broke the clods in the furrows.

she worked all day now and the child lay on an old
torn quilt on the ground, asleep. when it cried the woman
stopped and uncovered her bosom to the child's mouth,
sitting flat upon the ground, and the sun beat down upon

woman made all the shoes for himself and for the old
man and for her own feet and the child's. he would not
know what to make of it if she wished to buy shoes!

there was never anything hanging from the rafters in
his uncle's crumbling old house. but in his own there
was even a leg of pork wich he had bought from his
neighbour, ching, when he killed his pig that looked as
though it were sickening for a disease. the pig had been
caught early before it lost flesh and the leg was a large
one and o-lan had salted it thoroughly and hung it to dry.
there were, as well, two of their own chickens killed and
drawn and dried with the feathers on and stuffed with
salt inside.

in the midst of all this plenty they sat in the house,
therefore, when the winds of winter came out of the desert
to the north-east of them — winds bitter and

near the fields. only the bamboo leaves clung to the bam-
boos in the sparse clump to the east of the house, and even
though the wind wrenched the stems double, the leaves
clung.

with this dry wind the wheat seed that lay in the ground
could not sprout, and wang lung waited anxiously for
the rains. and then the rains came suddenly out of a still
grey day when the wind fell and the air was quiet and
warm, and they all sat in the house filled with well-being,

38



watching the rain fall full and straight and sink into the
fields about the dooryard and drip from the thatched ends
of the roof above the door. the child was amazed and
stretched out his hands to catch the silver lines of the rain
as it fell, and he laughed and they laughed with him and
the old man squatted on the floor beside the child and said :
'there is not another child like this in a dozen villages.
those brats of my brother notice nothing before they
walk.'

and in the fields the wheat seed spro

he new clothes they all wore and the
child who was a son, he said further, 'one has no need to
wish you more fortune this year than you have had in the
last.'

wang lung answered negligently, as one speaks to a
man who is scarcely an equal, 'good harvests — good har-
vests ' and he stepped with assurance inside the gate.

the gateman was impressed with all he saw and he said
to wang lung:

'do you sit within my wretched room while i announce
your woman and son within.'

and wang lung stood watching them go across the
court, his wife and his son, bearing gifts to the head of a
great house. it was all to his honour, and when they had
dwindled down the long vista of the courts one inside the
other, and had turned at last wholly out of sight, he went
into the gateman's house and there he accepted as a matter
of course from the gateman's pock-marked wife the honour-
able seat to the left of the table in the middle room, and he
accepted with only a slight nod the bowl of tea which she

but why not a piece of your uncle's land? he is clamour-

'that land of my uncle's,' said wang lung loudly, 'i

would not have it. he has been dragging a crop out of it
in this way and that for twenty years, and not a bit has
he put back of manure or bean-cake. the soil is like lime.
no, i will buy hwang's land.'

he said 'hwang's land' as casually as he might have
said 'ching's land' — ching, who was his farmer neigh-
bour. he would be more than equal to these people in the
foolish, great, wasteful house. he would go with the silver
in his hand and he would say plainly:

'i have money. what is the price of the earth you wish
to sell?' before the old lord he heard himself saying and
to the old lord's agent, 'count me as any one else. what
is the fair price? i have it in my hand.'

and his wife, who had been a slave in the kitchens of
that proud family, she would be

proudly before the agent the man had scraped it up care-
lessly in his hands and said :

'here is enough for a few days of opium for the old lady,
at any rate.'

and the wide difference that still lay between him and
the great house seemed suddenly impassable as the moatful
of water in front of him, and as high as the wall beyond,
stretching up straight and hoary before him. he was filled
with an angry determination then, and he said to his heart
that he would fill that hole with silver again and again
until he had bought from the house of hwang so much
land that his own would be less than an inch in his sight.

and so this parcel of land became to wang lung a sign
and a symbol.

r spring came with blustering winds and torn clouds of
rain, and for wang lung, the half-idle days of winter were
plunged into long days of desperate labo

time he noticed its growth swelling her body until the
day came in autumn when she laid down her hoe one morn-
ing and crept into the house. he did not go back that day
even for his noon meal, for the sky was heavy with thun-
derclouds and his rice lay dead ripe for gathering into
sheaves. later, before the sun set, she was back beside him,
her body flattened, spent, but her face silent and undaunted.
his impulse was to say:

tor this day you have had enough. go and lie upon
your bed.' but the aching of his own exhausted body made
him cruel, and he said to himself that he had suffered as
much with his labour that day as she with her childbirth,
and so he only asked between the strokes of his scythe:

48 1



'is it male or female?'
she answered calmly:
it is another male.'

they said nothing more to each other, but he was pleas-
ed, and the incessant bending and stooping seemed less
arduous, and working on until the moon rose above a
bank of purple clouds, they finished the field and went

 angered
him that as he saw himself and his sons rising into a landed
family, this shiftless brood of his cousins should be run-
ning loose, bearing the same name as his own.

the next day his uncle came to the field where he was
working. o-lan was not there, for ten moons had pass-
ed since the second child was born and a third birth was
close upon her, and this time she was not so well, and for
a handful of days she had not come to the fields, and so
wang lung worked alone. his uncle came slouching along
a furrow, his clothes never properly buttoned about him,
but caught together and held insecurely with his girdle, so
that it always seemed that if a gust of wind blew at him
he might suddenly stand naked. he came to where wang
lung was, and he stood in silence while wang lung hoed
a narrow line beside the broad beans he was cultivating.
at last wang lung said maliciously and without look-
ing up:

work. these beans must, if

hardy beans, and from his cornfield, which he h^d planted
in despair when the rice beds had yellowed and died be-
fore ever the plants had been set into the watered field, he
plucked short stubby ears with the grains scattered here
and there. there was not a bean lost in the threshing. he
set the two little boys to sifting the dust of the thresh-
ing-floor between their fingers after he and the woman had
flailed the bean vines, and he shelled the corn upon the
floor in the middle room, watching sharply every grain that
flew wide. when he would have put the cobs away for
fuel, his wife spoke out:

'no — do not waste them in burning. i remember when
i was a child in shantung when years like this came, even
the cobs we ground and ate. it is better than grass.'

when she had spoken they all fell silent, even the
children. ther0 was foreboding in these strange brilliant
days when the land was failing them. only the girl child
knew no fear. for her there were the mother's two great

had known the beast, when they had bought it a small
calf. and he said:

'how can we eat the ox? how shall we plough again?'

but the old man answered, tranquil enough:

'well, and it is your life or the beast's, and your son's
life or the beast's, and a man can buy an ox again more
•easily than his own life.'

but wang lung would not that day kill it. and the next
day passed and the next, and the children cried out for food
and they would not be comforted and o-lan looked at
wang lung, beseeching him for the children, and he saw
at last that the thing had to be done. so he said roughly :
60



'let it be killed then, but i cannot do it.'

he went into the room where he slept and he laid himself
upon the bed and he wrapped the quilt about his head that
he might not hear the beast's bellowing when it died.

then o-lan crept out and she took a great iron knife
she had in the kitchen and she cut a great gash in the
beast's neck, and thus she severed its life. and she took
a bowl and caught

in such times.' she pressed her hand to her belly as she
spoke, and the men were ashamed before her and went
out one by one, for they were not evil men except when
they starved.

one lingered, that one called ching, a small, silent, yel-
low man with a face like an ape's in the best of times, and
now hollowed and anxious. he would have spoken some
good word of shame, for he was an honest man and only
his crying child had forced him to evil. but in his bosom
was a handful of beans he had snatched when the store was
found and he was fearful lest he must return them if he
spoke at all, and so he only looked at wang lung with
haggard, speechless eyes and he went out.

wang lung stood there in his yard where y

what was given him, and there was still strength in him to
creep about the dooryard at noon when the sun was warm.
he was more cheerful than any of them and he quavered
forth one day in his old voice that was like a little wind
trembling among cracked bamboos:

'there have been worse days — there have been worse
days. once i saw men and women eating children.'

'there will never be such a thing in my house,' said
wang lung, in extremist horror.

there was a day when his neighbour, ching, worn now
to less than the shadow of a human creature, came to the
door of wang lung's house and he whispered from his
lips that were dried and black as earth:

'in the town the dogs are eaten and everywhere the
horses and the fowls of every sort. here we have eaten the
beasts that ploughed our fields and the grass and the bark
of trees. what now remains for food?'

wang lung shook his head hopelessly. in his bosom
lay the slight, skeleton-like body of his girl child, and he
looked down into th

e delicate bony face, and into the sharp,
isad eyes that watched him unceasingly from his breast.

15056, 5.



when he caught those eyes in his glance, invariably there
wavered upon the child's face a flickering smile that broke
his heart.

ching thrust his face nearer.

'in the village they are eating human flesh,' he whisper-
ed. 'it is said your uncle and his wife are eating. how else
are they living and with strength enough to walk about —
they, who, it is known, have never had anything?'

wang lung drew back from the deathlike head which
ching had thrust forward as he spoke. with the man's
eyes close like this, he was horrible. wang lung was sud-
denly afraid with a fear he did not understand. he rose
quickly as though to cast of

her skin. 'only wait until to-morrow,' she said. 'i shall

'to-morrow, then,' answered wang lung, and then he
saw his wife's face and he was moved with a pity greater
than any he had had for himself. this poor creature was
dragging forth yet another!

'how shall you walk, you poor creature!' he muttered,
and he said unwillingly to his neighbour ching, who still
leaned against the house by the door, 'if you have any
food left, for a good heart's sake give me a handful to save
the life of the mother of my sons, and i will forget that i
saw you in my house as a robber.'

ching looked at him ashamed and he answered humbly :

'i have never thought of you with peace since that hour.
it was that dog, your uncle, who enticed me, saying that
you had good harvests stored up. before this cruel heaven
i promise you that i have only a little handful of

eyes glistened, but wang lung pushed them away for once
and he took the food in to his wife as she lay and she ate
a little of it, bean by bean, unwillingly, but her hour was
upon her and she knew that if she had not any food she
would die in the clutches of her pain.

only a few of the beans did wang lung hide in his
own hand and these he put into his own mouth and he
chewed them into a soft pulp and then putting his lips to
the lips of his daughter he pushed into her mouth the food,
and watching her small lips move he felt himself fed.

that night he stayed in the middle room. the two boys

67



were in the old man's room, and in the third room o-lan
gave birth alone. he sat there as he had sat during the
birth of his first-born son and listened. she would not even
yet have him near her at her hour. she would give birth
alone, squatting over the old tub she kept for the purpose,
creeping about the room afterwards to remove the traces
of what had been, hiding .as an animal does the bir

the children without desiring any of it for himself. this
earth they had been eating in water for some days — god-
dess of mercy earth, it was called, because it had some slight
nutritious quality in it, although in the end it could not
sustain life; but made into a gruel it allayed the children's
craving for a time and put something into their distended,
empty bellies. he steadfastly would not touch the few beans
that o-lan still held in her hand, and it comforted him
vaguely to hear her crunching them, one at a time, a long
time apart.

and then, as he sat there in the doorway, giving up his
hope and thinking with a dreamy pleasure of lying upon
his bed and sleeping easily into death, some on.", came across
the fields — men walking towards him. he continued to sit
as they drew near and he saw that one was his uncle and
with him were three men whom he did not know.

 was no way of knowing. it stretched out long and
grey and very high, and against the base the small mat sheds
clung like fleas to a dog's back. wang lung observed the
huts and he began to shape his own mats this way and that,
but they were stiff and clumsy things at best, being made
of split reeds, and he despaired, when suddenly o-lan said :

"that i can do. i remember it in my childhood.'

and she placed the girl upon the ground and pulled the
mats thus and thus, and shaped a rounded roof reaching to
the ground and high enough for a man to sit under and not
strike the top, and upon the edges of the mats that were
upon the ground she placed bricks that were lying about
and she set the boys to picking up more bricks. when it
was finished they went within and with one mat she had
contrived not to use they made a floor and sat down and
were sheltered.

sitting thus and looking at each other, it seemed less
than possible that the day before they had left their own
house and their land and tha

crowded streets, with the vendors passing back and forth
with their baskets and women going out to market, and
carriages drawn by horses, and many other vehicles like
the one he pulled, and everything pressing against another
so that there was no possibility of running, he walked as
swiftly as he was able, conscious always of the awkward
bumping of his load behind him. to loads upon his back
he was used, but not to pulling, and before the walls of
the temple were in sight his arms were aching and his
hands blistered, for the shafts pressed spots where the hoe
did not touch.

the old teacher stepped forth out of the rickshaw when
wang lung lowered it as he reached the temple gates, and
feeling in the depths of his bosom he drew out a small
silver coin and gave it to wang lung, saying:

'now i never pay more than this, and there is no use
in complaint.' and with this he turned away and went
into the temple.

wang lung had not thought to complain for he had
not seen this coin before, a

and through these huts passed
children; they were^born and dead and born again until
neither mother or fathefenew how many had been bom or
had died, and scarcely knew even how many were living,
thinking of them only as mouths to be fed.

these men and these women and these children passed
in and out of the markets and the cloth-shops and wandered
about the countryside that bordered on the city, the men
working at this and that for a few pence, the women and
children stealing and begging and snatching; and wang
lung and his woman and his children were among them.

the old men and the old women accepted the life they
had. but there came a time when the male children grew
to a certain age, before they were old when they ceased to
be children, and then they were filled with discontent.
"there was talk among the young men, angry, growling
talk. and later when they were men and married and the
dismay of increasing numbers filled their hearts, the scat-
tered anger of their youth became settled in

c well, and what do they know or care of that?' said the
old man scornfully, peering under the wooden lid of the
nearest cauldron to see if the water bubbled yet. a cloud
of steam enveloped him and his wrinkled face could scarce-
ly be seen peering into the cauldron. nevertheless he was
kindly, for when he came forth again out of the steam he
saw what wang lung could not see from where he crouch-
ed, that once more the soldiers approached, searching the
streets from which now every able-bodied working man
had fled.

'stoop yet more,' he said to wang lung. 'they are come
again..'

and wang lung crouched low behind the cauldrons
and the soldiers clattered down the cobbles to the west,
and when the sound of their leathern boots was gone wang
lung darted out and seizing his rickshaw he ran with it
empty to the hut.

then to o-lan, who had but just returned from the road-
side to cook a little of the green stuff she had gathered,
he told in bro

he cried out suddenly and fell [to
weeping so that the children were frightened and the old
man, looking at his son in consternation, twisted his face
this way and that under his sparse beard, as a child's face

and again it was o-lan who said in her flat, plain voice:

'yet a little while and we shall see a thing. there is talk
everywhere now.'

from his hut where wang lung lay hid he heard hour
after hour the passing of feet, the feet of soldiers marching
to battle. lifting sometimes a very little the mat which
stood between thern and him, he put one eye to the crack
and he saw these feet^assing, passing, leather shoes and
cloth covered legs, marching one after the other, pair by
pair, score upon score, thousands upon thousands. in the
night when he was at his load he saw their faces flickering
past him, caught for an instant out of the darkness by the
flaming torch ahead. he dared ask nothing concerning
them, but he dragged his load doggedly, a

this dreadful din, and the old man called out into wang
lung's ear, 'now this i have never heard before in all my
years,' and the two boys yelled with fear.

but o-lan, when silence had fallen as suddenly as it
had gone, lifted her head and said, 'now that which i
have heard of has come to pass. the enemy has broken
in the gates of the city.' and before any could answer her
there was a shout over the city, a rising shout of human
voices, at first faint, as one may hear the wind of a storm
approaching, then gathering in a deep howl, louder and
more loud till it filled the streets.

wang lung sat erect then, on the floor of his hut, and
a strange fear crept over his flesh, so that he felt it stirring
among the roots of his hair, and every one sat erect and
they all stared at each other waiting for something they
knew not. but there was only the noise of the gathering
of human beings and each man howling.

then over the wall and not far from them they heard
the sound of a great door creaking u
 
 ___________________________
 
 ajar and the people pressed for-
ward so tightly packed together that foot was on foot and
body wedged tightly against body so that the whole mass
moved together as one. others hurrying from the back
caught wang lung and forced him into the crowd so that
whether he would or not he was taken forward with them,
although he did not himself know what his will was, be-
cause he was so amazed at what had come about.

thus was he swept along over the threshold of the great
gates, his feet scarcely touching the ground in the pressure
of people, and like the continuous roar of angry beasts
there went on all around the howling of the people.

through court after court he was swept, into the very
inner courts, and of those men and women who had lived
in the house he saw not one. it was as though here were
a palace long dead except that early lilies bloomed among
the rocks of the gardens and the golden flowers of the
early trees of spring blossomed upon bare branches. but
in the rooms food stood upon

nd where the kitchens are, into the inner
courts, where the lords and ladies have their dainty beds
and where stand their lacquered boxes of black and red
and gold, their boxes of silken clothing, where carved ta-
bles and chairs are, and upon the walls painted scrolls.
and upon these treasures the crowd fell, seizing at and
tearing from each other what was revealed in every newly
opened box or closet, so that clothing and bedding and
curtains and dishes passed from hands to hand, each hand
snatching that which another held, and none stopping to
see what he had.



only wang lung in the confusion took nothing. he
had never in all his life taken what belonged to another,
and not at once could he do it. so he stood in the middle
of the crowd at first, dragged this way and that, and then
coming somewhat to his senses, he pushed with persever-
ance toward the edge-a^k^found himself at last on the fringe
of the multitude, and here she stood, swept along slightly

left of the winter's starving — he was surly with them.

'which of you tore away my door and which of you
have my rake and my hoe and which of you burned my
roof in his oven?' thus he bawled at them.

and they shook their heads, full of virtue; and this
one said, 'it was your uncle,' and that one said, 'nay,
with bandits and robbers roving over the land in these evil
times of famine and war, how can it be said that this one
or that stole anything? hunger makes thief of any man.'

then ching, his neighbour, came creeping forth from
his house to see wang lung and he said:

'through the winter a band of robbers lived in your
house and preyed ujdon the village and the town as they /
were able. your uncle, it is said, knows more of them
than an honest man should. but who knows what is true
in these days? i would not dare to accuse any man.'

this man was nothing but a shadow indeed, so close
did his skin stick to his bones and so thin and grey had
his hair grown, although he had

er starve and die also.' he paused
and fell silent and after a time he said$ 'if i had a little seed i '
i would plant once more, but no seed have i.'

'come here!' cried wang lung roughly and dragged
him into the house by the hand and he bade the man hold
up the ragged tail of his coat and into it wang lung
poured from the store of seed he had brought from the
south. wheat he gave him and rice and cabbage seed and
he said:

'to-morrow i will come and plough your land with my \j
good ox.'

then ching began to weep suddenly and wang lung
rubbed his own eyes and cried out as if he were angry,
'do you think i have forgotten that you gave me that '
handful of beans ?' but ching could answer nothing, only
he walked away weeping and weeping without stop.

it was joy to wang lung to find that his uncle was no
longer in the village; and where he was none knew certainly.
some said he had gone to a city and some said he was in
far distant parts with his wife and his son. but there was

man answered eagerly, and her eyes were
fastened on his :

'he will — he will — on my life!'

then wang lung said to her plainly :

'will you sell the land for gold or for silver or for
jewels?'

and her eyes glittered as she spoke and she said:
'i will sell it for jewels!'

xvii

wang lung had now more land than a man
with an ox can plough and harvest, and more harvest
than one man can garner, and so he built another small
room to his house and he bought an ass and he said to his
neighbour ching:

'sell me the little parcel of land that you have and leave
your lonely house and come into my house and help me
with my land.' and ching did this and was glad to do it.

fields, more rice than wang lung had ever planted he

so that lands that were bef

ore dry were this year fit for rice.
then when this harvest came he and ching alone could not
harvest it, so great it was, and wang lung hired two other
men as labourers who lived in the village and they har-
vested it.

he remembered also the idle young lords of the fallen
great house as he worked on the land he had bought from
the house of hwang, and he bade his two sons sharply
each morning to come into the fields with him and he set
them at what labour their small hands could do, guiding
the ox and the ass, and making them, if they could accom-
plish no great labour,

threshed far more than could be eaten. he hired more labour-
ers each year for his fields until he had six men and he build-
ed a new house behind his old one, a large room behind a
court and two small rooms on each side of the court beside
the large room. the house he covered with tiles, but thei
walls were still made of the hard tamped earth from the
fields, only he had them brushed with lime and they were
white and clean. into these rooms he and his family moved,
and the labourers, with ching at their head, lived in the old
house in front.

by this time wang lung had thoroughly tried ching,
and he found the man honest and faithful, and he set ching
to be his steward over the men and over the land and he
paid him well, two silver pieces a month besides his food.
but with all wang lung's urging ching to eat and eat well,
the man still put no flesh on his bones, remaining always a
small, spare, lean man of great gravity. nevertheless he
laboured gladly, pottering silently from dawn unt
 
 ___________________________
 
 could be silent: and hour after hour he lifted his
hoe and let it fall, and at dawn and sunset he would carry
to the fields the buckets of water or of manure to put upon
the vegetable rows.

but still wang lung knew that if any one of the labour-
ers slept too long each day under the date trees or ate
more than his share of the bean-curd in the common dish
or if any bade his wife or child come secretly at harvest
time and snatch handfuls of the grain that was being beaten
out under the flails, ching would, at the end of the year
when master and man feast together after the harvest, whis-
per to wang lung:

'such an one and such an one do not ask back for the
next year.'

and it seemed that the handful of peas and of seed
which had passed between these two men made them broth-
ers, except that wang lung, who was the younger, took
the place of the elder, and ching never wholly forgot that

but since much of the land could not be planted he was
136



more idle than he had ever been in his life and being idle
and full of good food he grew impatient when he had slept
all he could sleep and done all there was to be done. there
were, besides, the labourers, whom he hired for a year at a
time, and it was foolish for him to work when there were
those who ate his rice while they were half idle waiting day
after day for the waters to recede. so after he had bade them
mend the thatching of the old house and see to the setting
of the tiles where the new roof leaked and had commanded
them to mend the hoes and the rakes and the ploughs and
to feed the cattle and to buy ducks to herd upon the water
and to twist hemp into ropes — all those things which in
the old days he did himself when he tilled his land alone —
his own hands were empty and he did not know what to do
with himself.

now a man cannot sit all day and stare at a lake of
water covering his fields, not can he eat m

g of her wide sweet eyes, waiting
for her. he had never enough of her, and he went back
to his house in the dawn, dazed and unsatisfied.

the days were endless. he would not sleep any more
upon his bed, making a pretence of heat in the room, and
he spread a mat under the bamboos and slept there fit-
fully, lying awake to stare into the pointed shadows of the
bamboo leaves, his breast filled with a sweet sick pain he
could not understand.

and if any spoke to him, his wife or his children, or if
ching came to him and said, c the waters will soon recede
and what is there we should prepare of seed?' he shouted
and said:

'why do you trouble me?'

and all the time his heart was like to burst because he
could not be satisfied of this girl.

thus as the days went on and he lived only to pass
the day until the evening came, he would not look at the
grave faces of o-lan and of the children, suddenly sober in
their play when he approached, nor even at his old father
who peered at him and asked:

'wh

for all these names of love she had taught him, as one
teaches new words to a child. she had taught him to say
them to her and he could not say them enough for his
own heart, even while he stammered them, he whose
speech had all his life been only of planting and of harvests
and of sun and rain.

thus the silver came out of the wall and out of the
sack, and o-lan who in the old days might have said to
him easily enough, 'and why do you take the money from
the wall,' now said nothing, only watching him in great
misery, knowing well that he was living some life apart



152



from her and apart even from the land, but not knowing
what life it was. but she had been afraid of him from
that day when he had seen clearly that she had no beauty
of hair or of person and when he had seen her feet were
large, and she was afraid to ask him anything, because of ^
his anger that was always ready for her now.

there came a day when wang lung returned to his
house over the fields and he drew near to he
 
 ___________________________
 
ng lung saw that his



155



uncle and his uncle's wife and son would be courteous
enough for the sake of their food and their shelter, then
his thoughts turned more violently than ever to the girl
lotus and he muttered to himself:

'when a man's house is full of wild dogs he must seek
peace elsewhere.'

and all the old fever and pain burned in him and he
was still never satisfied of his love.

now what o-lan had not seen in her simplicity nor the
old man because of the dimness of his age nor ching be-
cause of his friendship, the wife of wang lung's uncle
saw at once and she cried out, the laughter slanting from
her eyes:

'now wang lung is seeking to pluck a flower some-
where.' and when o-lan looked at her humbly, not un-
derstanding, she laughed and said again, 'the melon must
always be spilt wide open before you can see the seeds,
eh? well, then, plainly, your man is mad over another
woman!'

this wang lung heard his uncle's wife say in the court
outside his window as he lay dozing a

more rooms and another court and
there must be a place where he could go with his love and
be separate. so while he waited for his uncle's wife to
complete the matter, he called his labourers, and commanded
them to build another court to the house behind the middle
room, and around the court three rooms, one large and
two small on either side. and the labourers stared at him,
but dared no reply and he would not tell them anything,
but he superintended them himself, so that he need not
talk with ching even of what he did. and the men digged
the earth from the fields and made the walls and beat them
down, and wang lung sent to the town and bought tiles
for the roof.

then when the rooms were finished and the earth smooth-
ed and beaten down for a floor, he had bricks bought
and the men set them closely together and welded them
with lime and there was a good brick floor to the three
rooms for lotus. and wang lung bought red cloth to
hang at the doors for curtains and he bought a new table
and

are worthless fellows,' and he was angry that he felt his
face hot and red and so he would not speak aloud at all.

then the curtain was lifted and before he knew what
he did he looked and he saw sitting in the shadowy recess
of the chair, painted and cool as a lily, the girl lotus. he
forgot everything, even his anger against the grinning
fellows from the town, everything but that he had bought
this woman for his own and she had come to his house
for ever, sind he stood stiff and trembling, watching as
she rose, graceful as though a wind had passed over a
flower. then as he watched and could not take his eyes
away, she took cuckoo's hand and stepped out, keeping >
her head bowed and her eyelids dropped as she walked,
tottering and swaying upon her little feet, and leaning upon
cuckoo. and as she passed him she did not speak to him,
but she whispered only to cuckoo, faintly:

'where is my apartment?'

then his uncle's wife came forward to her other side j
and between them they led the girl

into the court and into !
the new rooms that wang lung had built for her. and of
all wang lung's house there was none to see her pass, for j
he had sent the labourers and ching away for the day to j
work on a distant field, and o-lan had gone somewhere he
knew not and had taken the two little ones with her and
the boys were in school and the old man slept against the
wall and heard and saw nothing, and as for the poor fool, j
she saw no one who came and went and knew no face
except her father's and her mother's. but when lotus had
gone in cuckoo drew the curtains after her. j

then after a time wang lung's uncle's wife came out,
laughing a little maliciously, and she

nd the land lay shi-
ning under the dry cold wind and under the ardent sun.

then a voice cried out in him, a voice deeper than
love cried out in him for his land. and he heard it above
every other voice in his life and he tore off the long robe
he wore and he stripped off his velvet shoes and his white
stockings and he rolled his trousers to his knees and he
stood forth robust and eager and he shouted:

'where is the hoe and where the plough? and where
is the seed for the wheat planting? come, ching, my
friend — come — call the men — i go out to the land!'

as he had been healed of his sickness of heart
when he came from the southern city and comforted by
the bitterness he had endured there, so now again wang
lung was healed of his sickness of love by the good dark
earth of his fields and he felt the moist soil on his feet and he
smelled the earthy fragrance rising up out of the furrows
he turned for the wheat. he ordered his labourers hither
and thither and they did

the soil, and then he called to ching and gave him the
ropes, and he himself took a hoe and broke up the soil
into fine loamy stuff, soft as black sugar, and still dark
with the wetness of the land upon it. this he did for the
sheer joy he had in it and not for any necessity, and when
he was weary he lay down upon his land he slept and
the health of the earth spread into his flesh and he was
healed of his sickness.

when night came and the sun had gone blazing down
without a cloud to dim it, he strode into his house, his body

right for his son, and he must see to it that there was a
wife chosen and betrothed for his son so that the lad need
not go begging into a great house as he had and pick
up what was left and what no one wanted, for his son was
the son of a man who was rich and who owned land in
his right.

wang_lung set himself, therefore, to the seeking of a
mai j who might be his son's wife, and it was no slight
task, for he would have no one who was a common and
ordinary female. he talked of it one night to ching, after
the two of them had been alone in the middle room taking
account of what must be bought for spring planting and of
what they had of their own seed. he talked not as one
who expects great help, for he knew ching was too simple,
but still he knew the man was faithful as a good dog is
faithful to its master, and it was relief to speak what he
thought to such an one.

ching stood humbly as wang lung sat at the table
and spoke, for in spite of wang lung's urging, he would
not, now that w r an

g lung had become rich, sit in his pre-
sence as though they were equal, and he listened with fixed
attention as wang lung spoke of his son and of the one
he sought, and when wang lung was finished, ching sighed
and he said in his hesitant voice that was scarcely more
than a whisper:

'and if my poor girl were here and sound you might
have her for nothing at all and my gratitude, too, but
where she is i do not know, and it may be she is dead
and i do not know.'

then wang lung thanked him, but he forebore to say
what was in his heart, that for his son there must be one
far higher than the daughter of such a one as ching, who
although a good man was, besides that, only a common
farmer on another'

le mild wine they made from their own rice
fermented, and he fell and lay on the ground in his vomit
like a dog.

wang lung was frightened and he called for o-lan, and
together they lifted the lad up and o-lan washed him and
laid him upon the bed in her own room, and before she
was finished with him the lad was asleep and heavy as one
dead and could answer nothing to what his father asked.

then wang lung went into the room where the two
boys slept together, and the younger was yawning and
stretching and tying his books into a square cloth to carry
to school, and wang lung said to him :

"was your elder brother not in the bed with you last
night?.'

and the boy answered unwillingly :
c no.'

there was some fear in his look and wang lung, seeing
it, cried out at him roughly :

'where was he gone?' and when the boy would not
answer, he took him by the neck and shook him and cried,
'now tell me all, you small dog!'

the boy was frightened at this, and he broke out sob-
bing and crying and said

he could not bear, and he said:

'it is not for myself — i do not need such as you. it is

and he felt suddenly in his throat a thickening of weep-
ing for his son. then the woman asked:
'well, and what of your son?'
and wang lung answered and his voice trembled :
'he was here last night.'

185



'there were many sons of men here last night,' replied
the woman, 'and i do not know which was yours.'

then wang lung said, beseeching her:
/think and remember a little slight young lad, tall for
his years, but not yet a man, and i did not dream he dared
to try a woman.'

and she, remembering, answered:

'were there two, and was one a young fellow with his
nose turned to the sky at the end and a look in his eye of
knowing everything, and his hat over one ear? and the
other, as you say, a tall big lad, but eager to be a man?'

and wang lung said, 'yes — yes — that is he — that is
my son!'

there came out of the south one day a small, slight cloud.
at first it hung on the horizon small and smooth as a mist,
except it did not come hither and thither as clouds blown
by the wind do, but it stood steady until it spread fanwise
up into the air.

the men of the village watched it and talked of it and



190



fear hung over them, for what they feared was this, that
locusts had come out of the south to devour what was
planted in the fields. wang lung stood there also, watching;
and they gazed and at last a wind blew something to their
feet, and one stooped hastily and picked it up and it was
a dead locust, dead and lighter than the living hosts behind.

then wang lung forgot everything that troubled him.
women and sons and uncle, he forgot them all, and he
rushed among the frightened villagers, and he shouted at
them:

'now for our good land we will fight these enemies
from the skies!'

but there were some who shook their heads, hopeless
from the start, and these sai

 anything. heaven has ordain-
ed that this year we shall starve, and why should we waste
ourselves in struggle against it, seeing that in the end we
must starve?'

and women went weeping to the town to buy incense
to thrust before the earth gods in the little temple, and
some went to the big temple in the town, where the gods
of heaven were, and thus earth and heaven were worshipped.

but still the locusts spread up into the air and on over
the land.

then wang lung called his own labourers and ching
stood silent and ready beside him, and there were others
of the younger farmers, and with their own hands these
set fire to certain fields and they burned the good wheat
that stood almost ripe for cutting and they dug wide moats
and ran water into them from the wells, and they worked
without sleeping. o-lan brought them food and the women
brought their men food, and the men ate standing and in
the field, gulping it down as beasts do, as they worked night
and day.

then the sky grew black and th

then he saw that they were but children trying to take
their mother's place and not able to do it, and he forebore.
and after that he saw to the poor fool himself night and
morning; if it rained or snowed or a bitter wind blew,
he led her in and he let her sit among the warm ashes that
dropped from the kitchen stove.

all during the dark winter months when o-lan lay
dying wang lung paid no heed to the land. he turned
over the winter's work and the men to the government of
ching, and ching laboured faithfully, and night and morn-
ing he came to the door of the room where o-lan lay and
he asked twice each day thus in his piping whisper how
she did. at last wang lung could not bear it because every
d^y and every night he could only say :

' 'to-day she drank a little soup from a fowl,' or 'to-day
she ate a little thin gruel of rice.'

so he commanded ching to ask no more but to do
the work well and it would be enough.

all during the cold dark winter wang lung sat often

lled priests from the buddhist temples and they
came in their long grey robes, their heads shaven and set
with the nine sacred scars, and these priests beat drums
and chanted the whole night through for the two who
were dead. and whenever they stopped their chanting j
wang lung poured silver into their hands and they took (

219



breath again and chanted and did not cease until dawn
rose.

now wang lung had chosen a good place in his fields
under a date tree upon a hill to set the graves, and ching
had the graves dug and ready and a wall of earth made
about the graves, and there was space within the walls for
the body of wang lung and for each of his sons and
their wives, and there was space for sons' sons, also. this
land wang lung did not begrudge, even though it was
high land and good for wheat, because it was a sign of
the establishment of his family upon their own land. dead
and alive they would rest upon their own land.

then on the appointed day after the priests had finished
the n

dead, came riding
jin a chair in order that before others she might appear
\ dutiful to the first wife of her husband. so for his uncle's
wife and for his uncle's son, wang lung hired chairs also
and for all of them he had robes of sackcloth, and even
for the poor fool he made a robe and hired a chair and
put her in it, although she was sorely bewildered and laugh-
ed shrilly when there should have been only weeping.

then, mourning and weeping loudly, they went to the
graves, the labourers and ching following and walking and
wearing white shoes. and wang lung stood beside the
two graves. he had caused the coffin of o-lan to be brought
from the temple and it was put on the ground to await
the old man's burial first. and wang lung stood and
watched and his grief was hard and dry, and he would not
cry out loud as others did, for there were no tears in his
eyes, because it seemed to him that what had come about



i was come about, and there was nothing to be done more

than he had done.

g heavily, he went on alone and he said
to himself:

pthere n that land of mine is buried the first good half
i of my life and more. it is as though half of me were buried
there, and now it is a. different life in my house/ t

and suddenly he wept a little, and he dried his eyes
with the back of his hand, as a child does.



xxvii

during all this time wang lung had scarcely
! thought pf what the harvests were, so busy had he been
| with the wedding feasts and funerals in his house, but one
day ching came to him and he said :

'now that the joy and sorrow are over, i have that to
tell you about the land.'

'say on, then,' wang lung answered. 'i have scarcely
thought whether i had land or noc these days except to
bury my dead in.'

ching waited in silence for a few minutes in respect to
wang lung when he spoke thus, and then he said softly:

'now may heaven avert it, but it looks as though there
would be such a flood this year as never was, for the water
is swelling up over the land, althoug
 
 ___________________________
 
h it is not summer yet,
and too early for it to come like this.'

but wang lung said stoutly:

'i have never had any good from that old man in heaven,
yet. incense or no incense, he is the same in evil. let us
go and see the land.' and as he spoke he rose.



now ching was a fearful and timid man and however
bad the times were he did not dare as wang lung did to
exclaim against heaven., he only said 'heaven wills it,'
and he accepted flood and drought with meekness. not so
wang lung. he went out on his land, on this piece and
that, and he saw it was as ching said. all those pieces
along the moat along the waterways, which he had bought
from the old lord of the house of hwang, were wet and
mucky from the full water oozing up from the bottom, so
that the good w
 
 ___________________________
 
heat on this land had turned sickly and
yellow.

the moat itself was like a lake and the canals were i
rivers, swift and curling in small eddies and whirlpools, and j
even a fool could see that with summer rains not yet come,
there would be that year a mighty flood and men and
women and children starving again. then wang lung ran
hastily here and there over his land and ching came silently
as a shadow behind him, and they estimated together which
land could be planted to rice and which land before the
young rice could be put on it would already be under water.
and looking at the canals brimming already to the edge of
their banks, wang lung cursed and said:
ft'now that old man in heaven will enjoy himself, for he
/will look down and see people drowned and starving and
that is what the accursed one likes/

this he said loudly and angrily so that ching shivered

the town so that the townspeople locked the gates of the j
wall continually except for one small gate called the western t
water gate, and this was watched by soldiers and locked at j |
night also. and besides those who robbed and those who) >
went south to work and to beg, even as wang lung had
once gone with his old father and his wife and children,
there were others who were old and tired and timid, and
who had no sons like ching, and these stayed and starved
and ate grass and what leaves they could find on high ;
places and many died upon the land and water.

then wang lung saw that a famine such as he had j
never seen was upon the land, for the water did not recede
in time to plant the wheat for winter and there could be
no harvest then the next year. and he looked well to his
own house and to the spending of money and food, and j
he quarrelled heartily with guckoo because for a long time j
she would still buy meat in

 the town, and he was glad at
last, since there must be flood, that the water kept between
his house and the town, so that she could no longer go to
market when she would, for he would not allow the boats
to be put forth except when he said, and ching listened to
him and not to cuckoo, for all her sharpness of tongue.

wang lung allowed nothing to be bought and sold after i
the winter came except what he said, and he husbanded
carefully all that they had. every day he gave out to his
daughter-in-law what food was needed in the house for that
day, and to ching he gave out what the labourers should
have, although it hurt him to feed idle men, and it hurt |
him so greatly that at last when winter cold came and the
water froze over, he bade the

m plainly then what he had told no
one:

'i hate these three worse than my life and if i could
think of a way i would do it. but your uncle is lord of a
horde of wild robbers, and if i feed him and coddle him
we are safe, and no one can show anger toward them.'

now when the eldest son heard this he stared until
his eyes hung out of his head, but when he had thought
of it for a while he was more angry than ever and he
said:

'how is this for a way? let us push them all into the
water one night. ching can push the woman for she is
fat and soft and helpless, and i will push the young one
my cousin, whom i hate enough for he is always peeping
at my wife, and you can push the man.'

but wang lung could not kill; although he would rather
have killed his uncle than his ox, he could not kill even
when he hated and he said:

jno, and even if i could do this thing, to push my (
father's brother into the water i would not, for if the other

your family, let her virginity be guarded here, and let
her be wed soon or late as you like.'

then the merchant, being a lenient and kindly man,
replied :

'well, and if this is how it is, let the maid come and i
will speak to my son's mother, and she can come and be
safe here in. the courts with her mother-in-law, and after
the next harvest or so, she can be wed.'

thus the matter was settled and wang lung was well
content, and he went away.

but on his way back to the gate in the wall, where
ching held a boat waiting for him, wang lung passed a
shop where tobacco and opium are sold, and he went in
to buy himself a little shredded tobacco to put in his water
pipe in the evenings, and as the clerk had it on the scales,
he said half unwillingly to the man:

'and how much is your opium if you have it?'

and the clerk said:

'it is not lawful in these days to sell it over the counter,
and we do not sell it so, but if you wish to buy it and have
the silver, it is weighed out in the -room behin

 him peace.

now as the winter wore away and the waters began to
recede so that wang lung could walk abroad over his
land it happened one day that his eldest son followed him
and said to him proudly:

'well, and there will soon be another mouth in the
house and it will be the mouth of your grandson.'

y

then wang lung, when he heard this, turned himself
about and he laughed and he rubbed his hands together
and said:

'here is a good day indeed!'

and he laughed again, and went to find ching and
tell him to go to the town to buy some fish and good food
and he sent it in to his son's wife and said:
'eat, make strong the body of my grandson.'
then all during the spring wang lung had the know-
ledge of this birth to come for his comfort. and when he
was busy about other things he thought of it, and when he
was troubled he thought of it and it was a comfort to him.

and as the spring grew into summer, the people who
had gone aw y from the floods came back again, one by
one and group by

d he said partly
to humour lotus and partly that he might see the child
fed and fattened:

' well, and let it be so if you wish it.'

so he bought the child for twenty pieces of silver and
she lived in the inner courts and slept on the foot of the
bed where lotus slept.

now it seemed to wang lung that he could have peace
in his house. when the waters receded and summer came
and the land was to be planted to good seed, he walked
hither and thither and looked at every piece and he discussed
with ching the quality of each piece of soil and what change
there should be of crops for the fertility of the land. and
whenever he went he took with him his youngest son, who
was to be on the land after him, that the lad might learn.
and wang lung never looked to see how the lad listened
and whether he listened or not, for the lad walked with his
head downcast and he had a sullen look on his face, and
no one knew what he thought.

but wang lung did not see what the lad did, only that
he walked there in

cloth the garment will be well cut so
that the scraps of cloth left over should lie in the palm of
her hand. such an one i want.'

now wang lung was the more astonished when he
heard this talk, for here was a young man whose life he
had not seen, even though it was his own son. it was not
such blood as this that ran in his own lusty body when he
was young, nor in the body of his eldest son; yet he admired
the wisdom of the young man and he said laughing:

'well, and i shall seek such a maid and ching shall
look for her among the villages.'

- still laughing, he went away and he went down the
street of the great house and he hesitated between the
stone lions and then, since there was none to stop him, he
went in and the front courts were as he remembered them
when he came in to seek the whore whom he feared for
his son. the trees were hung with drying clothes and
women sat everywhere gossiping as they drove their long
needles back and forth through shoe soles they made, and
children rolled n

reproach and he said mildly:

'i will come when the maid is found who is to wed /
the second son, for it is easier to stay here where ching is
until the matter in completed.'

the second son, therefore, gave over his urging.

there was left in the house, then, none but the uncle
and his wife and son and ching and the labouring men,
besides wang lung and his youngest son and the fool.
and the uncle and his wife and son moved into the inner
courts where lotus had been and they took it for their
own, but this did not grieve wang lung unduly, for he
saw clearly there were not many days of life left for his
uncle and when the idle old m

duty to that generation was over and if the younger man
did not do as he was told none would blame wang lung
if he cast him out. then ching moved into the outer
rooms and the laboures with him, and wang lung and
his son and the fool lived in the middle rooms, and wang
lung hired a stout woman to be servant to them.

and wang lung slept and rested himself and took no
heed of anything, for he was suddenly very weary and the
house was peaceful. there was none to trouble him, for
his youngest son was a silent lad who kept out o£ his
father's way and wang lung scarcely knew what he was,
so silent a lad was he.

but at last wang lung st

irred himself to bid ching
find a maid for his second son to wed.

now ching grew old and withered and lean as a reed,
but there was the strength of an old and faithful dog in]
him yet, although wang lung would no longer let him
lift a hoe in his hand or follow the oxen behind the plough, j
but still he was useful for he watched the labour of others
and he stood by when the grain was weighed and measured.
so when he heard what wang lung wished him to do he
washed himself and put on his good blue cotton coat and
he went hither and thither to this village and that and he

 it.'

it seemed to wang lung then that this was good enough
and he was anxious to be done with it and so he gave
his promise and when the papers were come he set his
mark to them, and he was relieved and he said:

'now there is but one more son and i am finished
with all this wedding and marrying and i am glad i am
so near my peace.'

and when it was done and the wedding-day set, he
rested and sat in the sun and slept even as his father had
done before him.

then it seemed to wang lung that as ching grew
feeble with age and since he himself grew heavy and
drowsy with his food and his age, and his third son was
yet too young for responsibility, that it would be well to
rent some of his farthest fields to others in the village.
this wang lung did, then, and many of the men in the
villages near by came to w 7 ang lung to rent his land and
to become his tenants, and the rent was decided upon,
half of the harvests to go to wang lung because he owned
i the land, and half to the one who hired bec

her's, and the spaces left empty for wang i
lung's name and his son's when they should die. and \
wang lung's son bought an incense urn and set it before \
the tablets.

when this was finished wang lung remembered the

red robe he had promised the goddess of mercy and so he
went to the temple to give the money for it.

and then, on his way back, as if the gods cannot bear
to give freely and not hide sting somewhere in the gift, one
came running from the harvest fields to tell him that ching
lay dying suddenly and had asked if wang lung would
come to see him die. wang lung, hearing the panting
runner, cried angrily:

'now i suppose that accursed pair in the temple are
jealous because i gave a red robe to a town goddess and
i suppose they do not know they have no power over child-
birth and only over , land.'

and although his noon meal stood ready for him to eat
he would not take up his chopsticks, although lotus called
loudly to him to wait until after the evening sun came; he
wou

ld not stay for her, and he went out. then when lotus
saw he did not heed her she sent a slave after him with an
umbrella of oiled paper, but so fast did wang lung run
that the stout maid had difficulty in holding the umbrella
over his head.

wang lung went at once to the room where ching had
been laid and he called out loudly to any one:

'now how did all this come about?'

the room was full of labourers crowding about and
they answered in confusion and haste:

'he would work himself at the threshing . . .* 'we told
him not at his age . . .' 'there was a labourer who is
newly hired . . .' 'he could not hold the flail rightly and
ching would show him . . .' 'it is labour too hard for an
old man . . .'

then wang lung called out in a terrible voice :

'bring me this labourer.'

a

is bare knees knocking
together, a great ruddy, coarse, country lad, with his teeth
sticking out in a shelf over his lower lip and round, dull
eyes like an ox's eyes. but wang lung' had no pity on
him. he slapped the lad on both his cheeks and he took
the umbrella from the slave's hand and he beat the lad
about the head, and none dared stop him lest his anger go

into his blood and at his age poison him. and the bump-
kin stood it humbly, blubbering a little and sucking his'
teeth.

then ching moaned from the bed where he lay and
wang lung threw down the umbrella and he cried out:

'now this one will die while i am beating a fool!'

and he sat down beside ching and took his hand and
held it, and it was as light and dry and small as a withered
oak leaf and it was not possible to believe that any blood
ran through it, so dry and light and hot it was. but ching's
face, which was pale and yellow every day, was now dark
and spotted with his scanty blood, and his half-opened
eyes were film

ed and blind and his breath came in gusts.
wang lung leaned down to him and said loudly in his
ear:

"here am i and i will buy you a coffin second to my
father's only!'

but ching's ears were filled with his blood, and if he
heard wang lung he made no sign, but he only lay there
panting and dying and so he died.

when he was dead wang lung leaned over him and
he wept as he had not wept when his own father died, and
he ordered a coffin of the best kind, and he hired priests
for the funeral and he walked behind wearing white mourn-
ing. he made his eldest son, even, wear white bands on
his ankles as though a relative had died, although his son
complained and said:

c he wa

s only an upper servant, and it is not suitable so
to mourn for a servant.'

but wang lung compelled him for three days. and
if wang lung had had his way wholly, he would have
buried ching inside the earthen wall where his father and
o-lan were buried. but his sons would not have it and they
complained and said:

'shall our mother and grandfather lie with a servant?
and must we also in our time?'

then wang lung, because he could not contend with
them and because at his age he would have peace in his
house, buried ching at the entrance to the wall and he was
comforted with what he had done, and he said:

249



'well, and it is meet, for has ever stood guardian to me
against evil
 
 ___________________________
 
.' and he directed his sons that when he himself
died he should lie nearest to ching.

then less than ever did wang lung go to see his lands,
because now ching was gone it stabbed him to go alone
and he was weary of labour and his bones ached when
he walked over the rough fields alone. so he rented out
all his -land that he could and men took it eagerly, for
i it was known to be good land. but wang lung would
never talk of selling a foot of any piece, and he would
only rent it for an agreed price for a year at a time. thus
i he felt it all his own and still in his hand.

and he appointed one of the labourers and his wife
and children to live in the co
 
 ___________________________
 
untry house and to care for
the two old opium dreamers. then seeing his youngest
son's wistful eyes, he said:

'well, and you may come with me into the town, and
i will take my fool with me too, and she can live in my
court where i am. it is too lonely for you now that ching
is gone, and with him gone, i am not sure that they will
be kind to the poor fool seeing there will be none to tell
if she is beaten or ill fed. and there is no one now to
teach you concerning the land, now that ching is gone.'

so wang lung took his youngest son and his fool with
him and thereafter he came scarcely at all for a long time
to the house on his land.



xxx

now to wang lung* it seemed there was no-
thing left to be desired in his condition, and now he
could sit in his chair ifi the sun beside his fool and he could
smoke his water pipe and be at peace since his land was
tended and the money from it coming into his hand without
care from him.

and so it might have been if it had not been for tha

 striving to make repair the years he
had lost as a farmer's son.

but there was one who ran staggering hither and yon
and content with his life and it was the son of the eldest
son. this small one never thought of any other place than
this great house and to him it was neither great nor small
but only his house, and here was his mother and here his
father and grandfather and all those who lived but to serve
him. and from this one did wang lung secure peace,
and he could never have enough of watching him and
laughing at him and picking him up when he fell. he
remembered also what his own father had done, and he
delighted to take a girdle and put it about the child and
walk, holding him thus from falling, and they went from
court to court, and the child pointed at the darting fish in
the pools and jabbered this and that and snatched the head
of a flower and was at his ease in the midst of everything,
and only thus did wang lung find peace.

nor was there only this one. the wife of the eldest

and lotus was displeased with her and she answered
pettishly:

'now he is only a man and a man is no more than a
man with a maid and they are all alike, and what is this
ado?' and he turned to cuckoo and said, 'take this slave
and give her to him.'

then the young maid put her hands together piteously
and cried as though she would die of weeping and fear
and her little body was all trembling with her fear, and
she looked from this face to that, beseeching with her
weeping.

now the sons of wang lung could not speak against
their father's wife, nor could their wives speak if they did
not, nor could the youngest son, but he stood there staring
at her, his hands clenched on his bosom and his brows
drawn down over his eyes, straight and black. but he did
not speak. the children and the slaves looked and were
silent, and there was only the sound of this dreadful,
frightened weeping of the young girl.

but wang lung was made uncomfortable by it, and
h

nd things long gone, so
far distant was he from her now. and he said heavily:

'when the old opium dreamer dies, i will find a man
for you, then, and it cannot be long.'

and wang lung did as he said. the woman came to
him one morning and said:

'now redeem your promise, my master, for the old
one died in the early morning without waking at all, and
i have put her in her coffin.'



271



and wang lung thought what man he knew now on
his land and he remembered the blubbering lad who had
caused ching's death, and the one whose teeth were a shelf
over his lower lip, and he said:

'well, and he did not mean the thing he did, and he is as
good as any and the only one i can think of now.'

so he sent for the lad and he came, and he was a man
grown now, but still he was rude and still his teeth were
as they were. and it was wang lung's whim to sit on the
raised dais in the great hall and to call the two before him
and he said slowly, that he might taste the whole flavour
of the strange moment:


 
 ___________________________
 
ld. so when
the two wives hated each other, their hatred spread to the
men also and the courts of the two were full of anger ,
and wang lung groaned because there was no peace in
his house.

wang lung had also his own secret trouble with lotus
since the day when he had protected her slave from the
son of his uncle. ever since that day the young maid had
been in disfavour with lotus, and although the girl waited
on her silently and slavishly, and stood by her side all day
filling her pipe and fetching this and that, and rising in
the night at her complaint that she was sleepless and rub-
bing her legs and her body to soothe her, still lotus was
not satisfied.

and she was jealous of the maid and she sent her from
the room when wang lung came in and she accused wang
lung that he looked at the maid. now wang lung had
not thought of the girl except as a poor small child who
was frightened and he cared as he might care for his poor
fool and no more. but when lotus accused him he took
thought to

d the red candles were lit on the
table and he sat there smoking, and pear blossom sat silently
on the other side of the table from him, and her hands
were folded and quiet in her lap. sometimes she. looked
at wang lung, fully and without coquetry as a child does,
and he watched her and was proud of what he had done.

then suddenly there was his youngest son standing
before him, sprung out of the darkness of the court, and
no one had seen him enter. but he stood there in some
strange crouching way, and without taking thought of it,
wang lung was reminded in a flash of memory of a
panther he had once seen the men of the village bring in
from the hills where they had caught it, and the beast
was tied but he crouched for a spring, and his eyes gleamed,
and the lad's eyes gleamed and he fixed them upon his
father's face. and those brows of his that were too heavy
and too black for his youth, he gathered fierce and black
above his eyes. thus he stood and at last he said in a low
and surch

and he saw it all clearly, even his little second daughter
of whom he had heard nothing for longer than he could
remember, and he saw her a pretty maid as she had been in
his house, her lips as thin and red as a shred of silk — and
she was to him like these who lay here in the land. then
he mused and he thought suddenly:
'well, and i shall be the next.'

then he went into the enclosure and he looked carefully
and he saw the place where he would lie — below his father
and his uncle and above ching and not far from o-lan.
and he stared at the bit of earth' where he was to lie and
he saw himself in it and back in his own land for ever.
and he muttered :

c i must see to the coffin.'

this thought he held fast and painfully in his mind, and
he went back to the town and he sent for his eldest son,
and he said:

'there is something i have to say.'

'then say on,' answered the son, 'i am here.'

but when wang lung would have spoken he suddenly
could not remember what it was that he wished to s

aid to
her:

'child, what was it i wanted to say?'
and pear blossom answered gently:
'where were you this day?'

'i was upon the land,' wang lung replied, waiting, his
eyes fixed on her face.

and she asked gently again:
'on what piece of land?'

then suddenly the thing flew into his mind again and
he cried, laughing out of his wet eyes :

'well, and i do remember. my son, i have chosen my

290

-



place in the earth, and it is below my father and his brother
and above your mother and next to ching, and i would see
my coffin before i die.'

then wang lung's eldest son cried out dutifully and
properly:

'do not say that word, my father, but i will do as you
say.'

then his son bought a carven coffin hewn from a great
log of fragrant wood which is used to bury the dead in and
for nothing else, because that wood is as lasting as iron,
and more lasting than human bones, and wang lung was
comforted.

and he had the coffin brought into his room and. he

looked at it every day.

then all of sudd
