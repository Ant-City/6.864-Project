[CHARACTER]

hazel's brother, [CHARACTER] is small and nervous, but only because he sees far beyond what most rabbits see. [CHARACTER] knows that something bad will happen to the home warren, and hazel trusts his brother enough to leave. [CHARACTER] guides the group through their travels, although he acts indirectly, through his brother. hazel looks to [CHARACTER] for guidance, and when [CHARACTER] has a bad feeling about something the other rabbits rarely ignore him. in the warren of the snares, the only reason they do not heed [CHARACTER] until bigwig is snared because they do not want to; they are too happy eating well and living easy to pay any attention to [CHARACTER], and even hazel does not want to listen. nonetheless, [CHARACTER] saves the group. he is not enthralled by the easy life in the new warren because he does not care for it. [CHARACTER] wants to be free; he wants a home where the rabbits can live in peace and quiet and defend themselves from natural evils. [CHARACTER] seeks a normal rabbit life--nothing more, nothing less. although he is a very unusual rabbit who uses very unusual means, he helps the group find their way.
there are times--such as when the rabbits have to cross the bridge--when the group is afraid, but [CHARACTER] trusts his instincts and his feeling that there is nothing to be afraid of. while the other rabbits are afraid of the unknown, especially man-made things, [CHARACTER] trusts his instincts. although he is not at home among bridges and boats and cars, he knows that just because these things are unfamiliar does not mean that they are any worse than what the rabbits already know. in fact, he points out that the rabbits often face more danger from rabbits and familiar circumstances than from the unknown. [CHARACTER] is able to guide the others because he knows what he is looking for and he cannot be seduced by danger hidden amongst familiar surroundings.
