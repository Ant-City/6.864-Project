boats strung like piglets along the pier, indicating the paranoids had indeed started someone's outboard. "come on, then," they 
called. suddenly, a dozen boats away, a form, covered with a blue polyethylene tarp, rose up and said, "baby igor, i need help." 
"i know that voice," said metzger. 

"quick," said the blue tarp, "let me hitch a ride with you guys." 

"hurry, hurry," called the paranoids. 

"manny di presso," said metzger, seeming less than delighted. 

"your actor/lawyer friend," oedipa recalled. 

"not so loud, hey," said di presso, skulking as best a polyethylene cone can along the landing towards them. "they're

examining the goods in dispute. till tony started chasing, anyway. the rest of the bones were used in the r&d phase of 
the filter program, back around the early '50's, way before cancer. tony jaguar says he harvested them all from the bottom of

rome, and had been the scene of a now ignored (in 1943 tragic) battle of attrition in a minor pocket developed during the 
advance on rome. for weeks, a handful of american troops, cut off and without communications, huddled on the narrow shore

"it isn't that," she protested. "i don't care what beaconsfield uses in its filter. i don't care what pierce bought from the cosa
