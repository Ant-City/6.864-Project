[CHARACTER] - 
      the king's right-hand man, wolsey is quite a schemer. he engineers a truce with france before the play begins, then a break with spain when the king divorces katharine, who is the daughter of the king of spain. he plants the idea in henry's mind that his marriage to katharine is illegal because he wants henry to marry the daughter of the king of france, thus, solidifying the treaty he engineered. but he inadvertently introduces anne bullen to the king at a dinner, and henry is smitten. in a letter, wolsey tries to convince the pope to deny henry a divorce until henry gets over his infatuation with anne. but henry intercepts the letter, along with an inventory of all the lands and holdings wolsey has slowly been acquiring from fallen lords. henry, enraged at wolsey's betrayal, fires him, removes his royal protection, and takes his possessions. wolsey finally understands that he was wrong to have so much arrogance and realizes that he was out of his depth to be plotting the future of the kingdom as he saw fit. finally understanding humility and honor to be the correct path, wolsey sees the truth of his wrongdoing. humbly, he leaves the court and dies soon after in a monastery.
