30. pierre de lusignan, king of cyprus, who captured
alexandria in 1363 (see note 6 to the prologue to the tales).
he was assassinated in 1369.

31. bernabo visconti, duke of milan, was deposed and
imprisoned by his nephew, and died a captive in 1385. his death
is the latest historical fact mentioned in the tales; and thus it
throws the date of their composition to about the sixtieth year
of chaucer's age.

32. the story of ugolino is told in the 33rd canto of the
"inferno."

the prologue.


"ho!" quoth the knight, "good sir, no more of this;
that ye have said is right enough, y-wis,*                  *of a surety
and muche more; for little heaviness
is right enough to muche folk, i guess.
i say for me, it is a great disease,*     *source of distress, annoyance
where as men have been in great wealth and ease,
to hearen of their sudden fall, alas!
and the contrary is joy and great solas,*              *delight, comfort
as when a man hath been in poor estate

but* i be merry, y-wis i will be blamed."                        *unless

and thus he said unto us every one,
this sweete priest, this goodly man, sir john.


notes to the prologue to the nun's priest's tale


1. the request is justified by the description of monk in the
prologue as "an out-rider, that loved venery."

2. on this tyrwhitt remarks; "i know not how it has happened,
that in the principal modern languages, john, or its equivalent,
is a name of contempt or at least of slight.  so the italians use
'gianni,' from whence 'zani;' the spaniards 'juan,' as 'bobo
juan,' a foolish john; the french 'jean,' with various additions;
and in english, when we call a man 'a john,' we do not mean

notes to the nun's priest's tale


1.  the tale of the nun's priest is founded on the fifth chapter
of an old french metrical "romance of renard;" the same story
forming one of the fables of marie, the translator of the breton
lays. (see note 2 to the prologue to the franklin's tale.)
although dryden was in error when he ascribed the tale to
chaucer's own invention, still the materials on which he had to
operate were out of cornparison more trivial than the result.

2.  tyrwhitt quotes two statutes of edward iii, in whi

and, after that, he with full merry cheer
said to another, as ye shall hear.


notes to the epilogue to the nun's priest's tale


1.  the sixteen lines appended to the tale of the nun's priest
seem, as tyrwhitt observes, to commence the prologue to the
succeeding tale -- but the difficulty is to determine which that
tale should be. in earlier editions, the lines formed the opening
of the prologue to the manciple's tale; but most of the
manuscripts acknowledge themselves defective in this part, and
give the nun's tale after that of the nun's priest. in the harleian
manuscript, followed by mr wright, the second nun

notes to the nun's priest's tale


1.  this tale was originally composed by chaucer as a separate
work, and as such it is mentioned in the "legend of good
women" under the title of "the life of saint cecile".  tyrwhitt
quotes the line in which the author calls himself an "unworthy
son of eve," and that in which he says, "yet pray i you, that
reade what i write", as internal evidence that the insertion of the
poem in the canterbury tales was the result of an afterthought;
while the whole tenor of the introduction confirm

"inter sepulchra martyrum latiantem" ("hiding among the tombs
of martyrs")

the force of the "to" is intensive.

of predestination and those who held that of free-will raged
with no less animation at chaucer's day, and before it, than it
has done in the subsequent five centuries; the dominicans
upholding the sterner creed, the franciscans taking the other
side. chaucer has more briefly, and with the same care not to

washerwoman or laundress; the word represents "meretrice"in
dante's original -- meaning a courtezan; but we can well
understand that chaucer thought it prudent, and at the same
time more true to the moral state of the english court, to
change the character assigned to envy. he means that envy is
perpetually at court,
