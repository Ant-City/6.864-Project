—and i want two of them.”

i could tell by the look on his face that

he wanted to help me, but couldn’t.

he said, “billy, those kind of dogs cost
money,  and  that’s  something  we  don’t
have right now. maybe some day when we
can  afford  it,  you  can  have  them,  but  not
right now.”

i  didn’t  give  up.  after  my  talk  with
papa,  i  went  to  mama.  i  fared  no  better
there. right off she said i was too young to
be hunting with hounds. besides, a hunter
needed  a  gun,  and  that  was  one  thing  i
couldn’t have, not until i was twenty-one
anyway.

i  couldn’t  understand  it.  there  i  was
sitting  right  in  the  middle  of  the  finest

 i  was  a
young daniel boone.

as  the  days  passed,  the  dog-wanting
disease  grew  worse.  i  began  to  see  dogs
in my sleep. i went back to my father and
mother.  it  was  the  same  old  story.  good
hounds  cost  money,  and  they  just  didn’t
have it.

“i know,” said papa, “and i feel just as
badly as you do, but what can i do? you
know we don’t have that kind of money.”

my dog-wanting became so bad i began
to  lose  weight  and  my  food  didn’t  taste
good any more. mama noticed this and she
had a talk with papa.
“you’re  going

to  do
something,” she said. “i never saw a boy
grieve like that. it’s not right, not right at
all.”

for hounds.”

he  showed  me  how  to  set  them  by
mashing  the  spring  down  with  my  foot,
and how to work the trigger. i took them to
bed with me that night.

the  next  morning  i  started  trapping
around  the  barn.  the  first  thing  i  caught
was  samie,  our  house  cat.  if  this  didn’t
cause  a  commotion!  i  didn’t  intend  to
catch him. i was trying to catch a rat, but
somehow he came nosing around and got
in my trap.

my  sisters  started  bawling  and  yelling
for  mama.  she  came  running,  wanting  to
know  what  in  the  world  was  going  on.
none of us had to tell her. samie told her
with his spitting and squalling.

he  was  mad.  he  couldn’t  understand
what  that  thing  was  that  was  biting  his
foot,  and  he  was  making  an  awful  fuss
about  it.  his  tail  was  as  big  as  a  wet
corncob and every hair on his small body
was  sticking  straight  up.  he  spit  and
yowled  and  dared  anyone  to  get  close  to

him.

my  sisters  yelled

their  fool  heads  off,
all  the  time  saying,  “poor  samie!  poor
samie!”

mama shushed them up and told me to
go  get  the  forked  stick  from  under  the
clothesline. i ran and got it.

mama  was  the  best  helper  a  boy  ever
had. she put the forked end over samie’s
neck and pinned him to the ground.

it  was  bad  enough  for  the  trap  to  be
biting his foot, but to have his neck pinned
down that way was too much. he threw a
fit.  i  never  heard  such  a  racket  in  all  my
life.

it  wasn’t  long  until  everything  on  the
place  was  all  spooked  up.  the  chickens
started  cackling  and  flew  way  up  on  the
hillside. daisy, our milk cow, all but tore

started  running  in  circles,  squealing  and
grunting.

samie wiggled and twisted. he yowled
and  spit,  but  it  didn’t  do  him  any  good.
mama  was  good  and  stout.  she  held  him
down, tight to the ground. i ran in and put
my  foot  on  the  trap  spring,  mashed  it
down,  and  released  his  foot.  with  one
loud squall, he scooted under the barn.

after  it  was  all  over,  mama  said,  “i
don’t  think  you’ll  have  any  more  trouble
with  that  cat.  i  think  he  has  learned  his
lesson.”

how wrong mama was. samie was one
of  those  nosy  kind  of  cats.  he  would  lie
up on the red oak limbs and watch every
move i made.

i found some slick little trails out in our
garden  down  under  some  tall  hollyhocks.
thinking  they  were  game  trails,  and  not
knowing
they  were  samie’s  favorite
hunting  trails,  i  set  my  traps.  samie

he went to investigate.

it  wasn’t  long  until  i  had  him  limping
with  all  four  feet.  every  time  papa  saw
samie lying around in the warm sun with
his feet wrapped up in turpentine rags, he
would  laugh  until  big  tears  rolled  down
his cheeks.

mama had another talk with papa. she

then scoot for the timber.

once  i  decided  to  make  friends  with
him because i felt bad about catching him
in my traps. i reached out my hand to rub
his back. he swelled up like a sitting hen.
his eyeballs got all green, and he growled
way down deep. he spat at me, and drew
back his paw like he was going to knock
my head off. i decided i’d better leave him
alone.

in no time at all i cleaned out the rats.
then  something  bad  happened.  i  caught
one  of  mama’s  prize  hens.  i  got  one  of
those  “young  man  peach  tree”  switchings
over that.

papa  told  me  to  go  down  in  the

canebrakes  back  of  our  fields  and  trap.
this opened up all kinds of new wonders.
i  caught  opossums,  skunks,  rabbits,  and
squirrels.

papa showed me how to skin my game.
in neat little rows i tacked the hides on the
smokehouse wall. i’d stand for hours and
admire my magnificent trophies.

traps  helped  my  dog-wanting
considerably,  but  like  a  new  toy,  the
newness  wore  off  and  i  was  right  back
where i started from. only this time it was
worse, much worse. i had been exposed to
the feel of wildlife.

i  started  pestering  mama  again.  she
said,  “oh,  no!  not  that  again.  i  thought
you’d  be  satisfied  with  the  traps.  no,
billy, i don’t want to hear any more about
hounds.”

i knew mama meant what she said. this
broke my heart. i decided i’d leave home.
i sneaked out a quart jar of peaches, some
cold  corn  bread,  and  a  few  onions,  and
started up the hollow back of our house. i

deep  voice  rang  loud  and  clear  in  the
frosty night. now and then i could hear the
hunter whooping to him.

the  hound  hunted  all  night.  he  quit
when  the  roosters  started  crowing  at
daybreak.  the  hunter  and
the  hound

weren’t  the  only  ones  awake  that  night.  i
stayed  up  and  listened  to  them  until  the
last tones of the hound’s voice died away
in the daylight hours.

that morning i was determined to have
some hounds. i went again to mama. this
time i tried bribery. i told her if she’d get
me  a  hunting  dog,  i’d  save  the  money  i
earned  from  my  furs,  and  buy  her  a  new
dress and a boxful of pretty hats.

that  time  i  saw  tears  in  her  eyes.  it
made me feel all empty inside and i cried
a little, too. by the time she was through
kissing me and talking to me, i was sure i
didn’t  need  any  dogs  at  all.  i  couldn’t
stand to see mama cry.

the next night i heard the hound again. i
tried  to  cover  my

that  coon  hunter  had  known  that  he  was
slowly  killing  a  ten-year-old  boy,  he
would have put a muzzle on his hound.

sleep was out of the question. even on
nights  when  i  couldn’t  hear  the  hound,  i
couldn’t  sleep.  i  was  afraid  if  i  did,  he
would  come  and  i  would  miss  hearing
him.

by the time hunting season was over, i
was a nervous wreck. my eyes were red
and bloodshot. i had lost weight and was
as thin as a bean pole. mama checked me
over. she looked at my tongue and turned
back one of my eyelids.

“if i didn’t know better,” she said, “i’d
swear  you  weren’t  sleeping  well.  are

you?”

“why,  mama,”  i  said,  “i  go  to  bed,
don’t i? what does a boy go to bed for if it
isn’t to sleep?”

by  the  little  wrinkles  that  bunched  up
on  her  forehead,  i  could  tell  that  mama
wasn’t satisfied. papa came in during one
of  these  inspections.  mama  told  him  she

time i had memorized the ad, i was seeing

the magazine was forgotten. i was lost in
thought.  the  brain  of  an  eleven-year-old
boy can dream some fantastic dreams.

how  wonderful  it  would  be  if  i  could
have two of those pups. every boy in the
country but me had a good hound or two.
but  fifty  dollars—how  could  i  ever  get
fifty dollars? i knew i couldn’t expect help
from mama and papa.

i remembered a passage from the bible
my  mother  had  read  to  us:  “god  helps
those  who  help  themselves.”  i  thought  of
the words. i mulled them over in my mind.
i  decided  i’d  ask  god  to  help  me.  there
on  the  banks  of  the  illinois  river,  in  the
cool  shade  of  the  tall  white  sycamores,  i
asked god to help me get two hound pups.
it wasn’t much of a prayer, but it did come
right from the heart.

for an instant there was complete silence,
and then my oldest sister giggled. the two
little ones stared at me.

with  a  half-hearted  laugh,  my  father
said, “well, now, i don’t know, but it’s a
pretty  good  ways.  what  do  you  want  to
know  for?  thinking  of  taking  a  trip  to
kentucky?”

“no,” i said. “i just wondered.”
my  youngest  sister  giggled  and  asked,

“can i go with you?”

i glared at her.
mama  broke  into  the  conversation,  “i
declare,  what  kind  of  a  question  is  that?
how  far  is  it  to  kentucky?  i  don’t  know

some  reason,  i  don’t  know  why,  i  just
couldn’t tell him.

that  night,  snuggled  deep  in  the  soft
folds of a feather bed, i lay thinking. i had
waited  so  long  for  my  dogs,  and  i  so

desperately  wanted  to  see  them  and  hold
them. i didn’t want to wait a whole week.
in  a  flash  i  made  up  my  mind.  very
quietly  i  got  up  and  put  on  my  clothes.  i
sneaked  into  the  kitchen  and  got  one  of
mama’s  precious  flour  sacks.  in  it  i  put
six eggs, some leftover corn bread, a little
salt, and a few matches. next i went to the
smokehouse  and  cut  off  a  piece  of  salt
pork. i stopped at the barn and picked up a
gunny sack. i put the flour sack inside the
gunny sack. this i rolled up and crammed
lengthwise in the bib of my overalls.

i was on my way. i was going after my

dogs.

this  remark,  my  heart
jumped  clear  up  in  my  throat.  i  thought
surely it was going to hop right out on the
depot  platform.  i  looked  up  and  tried  to
tell  him  who  i  was,  but  something  went
wrong.  when  the  words  finally  came  out

laughing, he got up from his chair and
came over to me. he reached and took the
sack from my shoulder.

“when we started looking for you,” he
said, “i went to the store and your grandpa
told me all about it. it wasn’t too hard to
figure  out  what  you  had  done,  but  you
should have told us.”

i ran to my mother and, dropping to my

knees, i buried my face in her lap.

as  mama  patted  my  head,  i  heard  her
say in a quavering voice, “oh, why didn’t
you tell us? why?”

i couldn’t answer.
between  sobs,  i  heard  the  squeals  of

delight from my sisters as they fondled my
pups.

i  heard  my  father  say,  “what’s  this

other stuff you’ve got?”

without  raising  my  head  from  my
mother’s  lap,  in  a  choking  voice  i  said,
“one is for you, one is for mama, and the
other is for the girls.”

i  heard  the  snapping  of  string  and  the

papa  came  over  to  mama.  laying  the
cloth  on  the  arm  of  her  chair,  he  said,
“well, you’ve been wanting a new dress.
here is enough cloth to make half a dozen

realizing that everything was forgiven,
i  stood  up  and  dried  my  eyes.  papa  was
pleased with his new overalls. my sisters

something i will never forget.

papa  asked  if  i  wanted  him  to  help

“no,”  i  said,  “i  think  i  can  do  it

myself.”

i  didn’t  sleep  too  well  that  night.  i
bored holes, drove nails, and fought coons
practically all night.

early  the  next  morning  i  went  to  the

trash pile. as i stirred around in the rusty
old  cans,  i  thought  of  another  time  i  had
searched for a can. finally i found the one
i wanted. it was bright and shiny.

everything  was  going  along  just  fine
until  mama  caught  me  cutting  out  the
circles  of  tin  with  her  scissors.  i  always
swore she could find the biggest switches
of any woman in the ozarks. that time she
overdid it. i was almost to the river before
the stinging stopped.

it  wasn’t  hard  to  find  places  for  my
traps. all  along  the  river  large  sycamore
logs lay partly submerged in the clear blue
water.  on  one  where  i  could  see  the
muddy little tracks of the ringtails, i bored
a  hole,  dropped  in  a  piece  of  tin

sycamore logs any more, and bright shiny
objects had about as much effect on them
as a coon hound would.

use? it was just a waste of time.

when the family sat down to breakfast,
i heard my oldest sister say, “mama, isn’t
billy going to get up for breakfast?”

“why, is he in his room?” mama asked.
“i  didn’t  know.  i  thought  he  was  down
looking at his traps.”

i  heard  papa  say,  “i’ll  go  wake  him

up.”

he came to the door and said, “you’d

better get up, billy. breakfast is ready.”

“i  don’t  want  any  breakfast,”  i  said.

“i’m not hungry.”

papa took one look at me and saw i had
a bad case of the ringtail blues. he came
over and sat down on the bed.

d her up in my arms and looked for
the  boy  pup.  when  the  coon  had  turned
him loose, he too had fallen off the log. he
was trying to get back to the coon. i darted
in and grabbed him by the hind leg.

with a pup under each arm and running
as  fast  as  i  could,  i  lit  out  for  the  house.
coming  out  of  the  bottoms  into  a  fresh-
plowed  field  i  set  my  pups  down  so  i
could  get  a  little  more  speed.  i  started
yelling  as  soon  as  i  came  in  sight  of  the
house.

mama  came  flying  out  with  my  sisters
right behind her. papa was out by the barn
harnessing  his
team.  mama  yelled
something  to  him  about  a  snake.  he
dropped the harness, jumped over the rail
fence, and in a long lope started for me.

mama  reached  me  first.  she  grabbed
me and shouted, “where did it bite you?”
“bite me?” i said. “why mama, i’m not

bit. i’ve got him, mama. i’ve got him.”

“got what?” mama asked.
“a big coon,” i said. “the biggest one

big as a twenty-gallon keg.

mama just groaned way down deep and
covered her face with her hands. some big
tears  squeezed  out  between  her  fingers.
almost  in  a  whisper,  i  heard  her  say,

“thank  god;  i  thought  you  were  snake-
bitten.”

my  sisters,  seeing  mama  crying,

puckered up and started bawling.

“he needs a whipping,” the oldest one
said, “that’s what he needs, scaring mama
that way.”

something busted loose inside me and i

cried a little, too.

sniffed. “i just wanted everyone to know i

“now that that’s all settled,” papa said,
“we had better go get that coon.” looking
at mama, he said, “why don’t you and the
girls  go  with  us.  i  don’t  think  it’ll  take

long.”

mama looked at me, smiled, and turned
to the girls. “would you like to go?” she
asked.

on  my  shirt.  she  stopped  me  and  started
looking me over.

“where  did  that  come  from?”  she

asked. “did that coon bite you?”

“no, mama,” i said. “i didn’t get close

enough for him to bite me.”

with  a  worried  look  on  her  face,  she
jerked out my shirt. “you don’t seem to be
scratched anywhere,” she said.

“maybe  this  is  where  it  came  from,”

papa said.

he reached down and picked up my boy

pup. his little black nose was split wide
open and was bleeding.

i  saw  a  relieved  look  come  over

mama’s face.

head.  “i  don’t  know,”  she  said.

“did  that  coon  get  hold  of  this  pup?”

papa asked.

“he  sure  did,  papa,”  i  said,  “but  it
wasn’t  the  coon’s  fault.  if  it  hadn’t  been
for little ann, he’d have eaten him up.”

i  told  how  my  dogs  had  tied  into  the

coon.

papa  laughed  as  he  fondled  my  pup.
“this dog is going to be a coon hound,” he
said, “and i mean a good one.”

the  coon  started  squalling  as  soon  as

we came in sight.

“my  goodness,”  mama  said,  “you
wouldn’t think anything so small would be
so vicious.”

papa  picked  up  a  club.  “now
everybody stand back out of the way,” he
said. “this won’t take long.”

my  pups  were  wanting  to  get  to  the
coon so badly that they were hard to hold.
i had to squeeze them up tight to keep them
from jumping right out of my arms.

my  sisters,  with  eyes  as  big  as  blue
marbles,  got  behind  mama  and  peeked
around her.

they ran for the house.

after  the  coon  was  killed,  i  walked
over.  papa  was  trying  to  get  the  coon’s
paw  from  the  trap.  he  couldn’t  do  it.
taking a pair of pliers from his pocket, he
said, “it’s a good thing i had these along
or we would have had to cut his foot off.”

lifted  the  coon’s  paw  from  the  hole.

own  domain,  it  towered  far  above  the
smaller trees.

it had taken me quite a while to find a
name suitable for the big sycamore. for a
while i had called it “the chicken tree.” in
some  ways  it  had  reminded  me  of  a

story  about  a  big  giant  that  lived  in  the
mountains and ate little children that were
lost.  right  away  i  started  looking  for
another name.

one  day,  while  lying  in  the  warm  sun
staring  at  its  magnificent  beauty,  i  found
the perfect name. from that day on, it was
called “the big tree.” i named the bottoms
around it “the big tree bottoms.”

walking around it, and using the moon
as  a  light,  i  started  looking  for  the  coon.

“well, all right,” he said.” if that’s the
way  you  want  it,  i’m  for  it  even  if  it  is
only  an  agreement  between  you  and  your
dogs. if a man’s word isn’t any good, he’s
no good himself.

“now  i  have  to  get  back  and  tell  your
mother  that  you’re  all  right.  it’s  a  cinch
that you can’t do that kind of work on an
empty  stomach,  so  i’ll  send  your  oldest
sister down with a lunch bucket.”

with  tears  in  my  eyes,  i  said,  “tell
mama i’m sorry for not coming home last

night.”

“don’t  you  worry  about  your  mother,”
he said, as he climbed on the mule’s back.
“i’ll take care of her. another thing, i have
to  make  a  trip  to  the  store  today  and  i’ll
talk  this  over  with  your  grandfather.  he
may be able to help some way.”

after  papa  left,  things  were  a  little
different. the tree didn’t look as big, and
my ax wasn’t as heavy. i even managed to
sing a little as i chopped away.

my sister got upset. she looked at me,
threw back her small head, and looked up
to the top of the big sycamore. “you’re as
crazy  as  a  bedbug,”  she  said.  “why,  i
never heard of such a thing.”

she  stepped  over  in  front  of  me  and
very seriously asked if she could look in

my eyes.

“look  in  my  eyes?”  i  said.  “what  do

you want to do that for? i’m not sick.”

“yes,  you  are,  billy,”  she  said,  “very
sick.  mama  said  when  old  man  johnson
went crazy, his eyes turned green. i want
to see if yours have.”

this was too much. “if you don’t get out
of  here,”  i  shouted,  “you’re  going  to  be
red instead of green, and i mean that.”

i grabbed up a stick and started toward
her. of course, i wouldn’t have hit her for
anything.

this scared her and she started for the
house. i heard her saying something about
an  old  coon  as  she  disappeared  in  the
underbrush.

collar  to  keep  him  from  jumping  out  and
going back to the tree.

i  couldn’t  see  this  determination  and
will  power  that  grandpa  was  talking
about very clearly. all i could see was a

big sycamore tree, a lot of chopping, and
the  hide  of  a  ringtail  coon  that  i  was
determined to have.

as we reached the house, mama came
out.  right  away  she  started  checking  me
over. “are you all right?” she asked.

“sure, mama,” i said. “what makes you

think something’s wrong with me?”

“well,  i  didn’t  know,”  she  said.  “the
way  you  acted  when  you  got  down  from
the buggy, i thought maybe you were hurt.”
“aw,  he’s  just  a  little  sore  and  stiff
from  all  that  chopping,”  grandpa  said,
“but  he’ll  be  all  right.  that’ll  soon  go
away.”

after  mama  saw  th

on  in.  we’ve  been  waiting  supper  on
you.”

“we’re having chicken and dumplings,”
them

mama  beamed,  “and  i  cooked
especially for you.”

during the meal i told grandpa i didn’t
think that the coon in the big tree was the
same  one  my  dogs  had  been  trailing  at
first.

“what makes you think that?” he asked.
i told how the coon had fooled us and
how  little  ann  had  seen  or  heard  this
other coon. i figured he had just walked up
on my dogs before he realized it.

a  smile  spread  all  over  grandpa’s
face. chuckling, he said, “it does look that
way,  but  it

that’s  when  he  came  down  and  that’s
when little ann either heard or saw him.”
pointing  the  fork  at  me,  grandpa  said
very  seriously,  “you  mark  my  word,
billy, in no time at all that little ann will
know every trick a coon can pull.”

“you  know,  grandpa,”  i  said,  “she
wouldn’t bark treed at the water oak like
old dan did.”

“course  she  wouldn’t,”  he  said.  “she

knew he wasn’t there.”

“why,  i  never  heard  of  such  a  thing,”
mama said. “i’d no idea coons were that
smart. why, for all anyone knows he may
not  be  in  the  big  tree  at  all.  maybe  he
pulled  another  trick.  it’d  be  a  shame  if
billy cut it down and found there was no

coon in it.”

“oh,  he’s

there,  mama,”  i  hastily
replied. “i know he is. they were right on
his  tail  when  he  went  up.  besides,  little
ann  was  bawling  her  head  off  when  i
came to them.”

“of  course  he’s  there,”  grandpa  said.

before  i  went  to  bed,  mama  made  me
take  a  hot  bath.  then  she  rubbed  me  all

for  my  doghouse.  i  didn’t  have  to  go  all

mama made me a cap out of my first coon hide.
i  was  as  proud  of  it  as  papa  would’ve
been  if  someone  had  given  him  a  dozen
missouri  mules.  mama  said  afterwards
that she wished she hadn’t made it for me
because,  in  some  way,  wearing  that  cap
must’ve  affected  my  mind.  i  went  coon
crazy.

i was out after the ringtails every night.
about  the  only  time  i  didn’t  go  hunting
was when the weather was bad, and even
then mama all but had to hog-tie me.

dog.” “some of these nights a big old coon
is  going  to  carry  her  off  to  his  den  and
raise some little coon puppies.”

i always took their kidding with a smile
on my face, but it made my blood boil like
the  water  in  mama’s  teakettle.  i  had  one
way  of  shutting  them  up.  “let’s  all  go  in

most hides in there.”

it  was  true  that  my  dogs  were  small,
especially  little  ann.  she  could  walk
under an ordinary hound; in fact, she was
a regular midget. if it had not been for her

i had often wondered what old dan would do
if  little  ann  got  into  some  kind  of  a
predicament. one night i got my answer.

for  several  days  a  northern  blizzard
had been blowing. it was a bad one. the
temperature  dropped  down  to  ten  below.
the storm started with a slow cold drizzle
and  then  sleet.  when  the  wind  started
blowing,  everything  froze,  leaving  the
ground as slick as glass.

trapped indoors, i was as nervous as a
fish out of water. i told mama i guessed it
was just going to storm all winter.

she  laughed  and  said,  “i  don’t  think  it
will, but it does look like it will last for a

while.”

she  ruffled  up  my  hair  and  kissed  me
between  the  eyes.  this  did  rile  me  up.  i
didn’t like to be kissed like that. it seemed
that i could practically rub my skin off and
still feel it, all wet and sticky, and kind of
burning.

sometime  on  the  fifth  night,  the  storm
blew itself out and it snowed about three
inches.

“well,  anyway,”  he  said,  “be  careful.
there’ll  be  no  moon  tonight  and  you’re
going to see some fog next to the river.”

walking  through  our  fields  i  saw  my
father  was  right  about  it  being  slick  and
dark.  several  times  i  slipped  and  sat
down. i couldn’t see anything beyond the
glow of my lantern, but i wasn’t worried.

through

before i left for home, i walked back to
the  sycamore  tree.  once  again  i  said  a
prayer,  but  this  time  the  words  were
different.  i  didn’t  ask  for  a  miracle.  in
every  way  a  young  boy  could,  i  said
“thanks.”  my  second  prayer  wasn’t  said
with just words. all of my heart and soul
was in it.

on  my  way  home  i  decided  not  to  say
anything  to  my  mother  and  father  about
little  ann’s  accident.  i  knew  it  would
scare  mama  and  she  might  stop  my
hunting.

reaching  our  house,  i  didn’t  hang  the
lantern  in  its  usual  place.  i  took  it  to  my
room and set it in a corner with the handle
standing up.

the next morning i started sneezing and
came  down  with  a  terrible  cold.  i  told
mama  i  had  gotten  my  feet  wet.  she
scolded  me  a  little  and  started  doctoring
me.

for three days and nights i stayed home.
all this time i kept checking the handle of
the  lantern.  my  sisters  shook  the

 over  and  straightened  my
suspenders, saying, “that was a very nice
question  for  my  little  daniel  boone  to
ask.”

bending over, she started kissing me. i
finally squirmed away from her, feeling as
wet  as  a  dirt  dauber’s  nest.  my  mother
never could kiss me like a fellow should
be  kissed.  before  she  was  done  i  was

kissed  all  over.  it  always  made  me  feel
silly and baby-like. i tried to tell her that a
coon hunter wasn’t supposed to be kissed
that  way,  but  mama  never  could
understand things like that.

i  stomped  out  of  the  house  to  see  how

my dogs were.

xii

the fame of my dogs spread all over our part
of  the  ozarks.  they  were  the  best  in  the
country.  no  coon  hunter  came  into  my
grandfather’s store with as many pelts as i
did.  grandpa  never  overlooked  an
opportunity to brag. he told everyone the
story  of  my  dogs,  and  the  part  he  had
played in getting them.

ome,  would  say,  “your
grandpa was telling me you got three big
coons over in pea vine hollow the other
night.” i would listen, knowing i only got
one, or maybe none, but grandpa was my
pal. if he said i caught ten in one tree, it

was just that way.

because  of  my  grandfather’s  bragging,
and his firm belief in my dogs and me, a
terrible thing happened.

one  morning,  while  having  breakfast,
mama  said  to  papa,  “i’m  almost  out  of
corn meal. do you think you can go to the
mill today?”

papa said, “i intended to butcher a hog.
we’re about out of meat.” looking at me,
he said, “shell a sack of corn. take one of
the  mules  and  go  to  the  mill  for  your
mother.”

with the help of my sisters, we shelled
the  corn.  throwing  it  over  our  mule’s
back, i started for the store.

on arriving at the millhouse, i tied my
mule  to  the  hitching  post,  took  my  corn,

toward  his  store.  i  thought  to  myself,
“there  goes  the  best  grandpa  a  boy  ever
had.”

lifting  the  sack  of  meal  to  the  back  of
my  old  mule,  i  started  for  home. all  the
way,  i  kept  thinking  of  old  dan,  little
ann, ghost coons, and the two ugly, dirty
pritchard  boys.  i  decided  not  to  tell  my
mother  and  father  anything  about  the  hunt
for  i  knew  mama  wouldn’t  approve  of
anything i had to do with the pritchards.

the  following  evening  i  arrived  at  the
designated spot early. i sat down by a red
oak tree to wait. i called little ann over
to me and had a good talk with her. i told
her  how  much  i  loved  her,  scratched  her
back, and looked at the pads of her feet.

listened.  when  i  had  finished,  he  kept
staring down at the floor in deep thought. i
could hear the sobbing of my mother in the
silence. i walked over to her. she put her
arms around me and said, “my poor little
boy.”

looking at me, he said, “you go across

i hurried to carry the sad message.
the  following  day  was  a  nasty  one. a
slow,  cold  drizzle  had  set  in.  feeling
trapped indoors, i prowled from room to
room. i couldn’t understand why my father

sat by the window and watched the road.

understanding my feelings, mama said,
“billy,  i  wouldn’t  worry.  he’ll  be  back
before  long.  it  takes  time  for  things  like
that.”

“i know,” i said, “but you would think

he would’ve been back by now.”

time  dragged  slowly  by.  late  in  the
afternoon,  i  saw  papa  coming.  our  old
mule  was
jogging  along.  water  was
shooting  out  from  under  his  feet  in  small

squirts at every step.

papa had tied the halter rope around the
mule’s neck. he was sitting humped over,

of his patched and worn mackinaw. i felt
sorry for him. he was soaking wet, tired,
sleepy, and hungry.

telling mama, “here he is,” i grabbed
my jumper and cap, and ran out to the gate
and waited.

i  was  going  to  ask  him  what  had
happened at the pritchards’ but on seeing
his  tired  face  and  wet  clothes,  i  said,
“papa, you had better go in to the fire. i’ll
take care of the mule, and do the feeding
and milking.”

“that would be fine,” he said.
after doing the chores, i hurried to the
house. i couldn’t wait any longer. i had to

papa  said  he  didn’t  know  as  he  never

said  they  were  the  funniest  bunch  he  had
ever  seen.  he  couldn’t  understand  them.
there  wasn’t  one  tear  shed  that  he  could
see. all  of  the  men  had  stayed  out  at  the
barn. they never had been invited in for a
cup of coffee or anything.

mama  asked  how  mrs.  pritchard  was

“they  have  their  own  graveyard  right

pritchard  said  they  would  take  care  of
everything,  and  didn’t  want  to  bother
people. he said it was too far for anyone

“you’re not getting a gun,” she said. “i

time ago you could have one when you are
twenty-one years old, and i mean just that.
i  worry  enough  with  you  out  there  in  the
hills  all  hours  of  the  night,  running  and
jumping,  but  i  couldn’t  stand  it  if  i  knew
you had a gun with you. no, sir. you can
just forget about a gun.”

“yes, mama,” i said, and sulked off to

my room.

lying  on  my  bed,  still  trying  to  figure
out what i could do to help, i glanced over
to the wall. there, tied in a small bundle,
was just what i needed.

some  time  back  my  sisters  had  made
some  flowers  for  decoration  day.  they
had  given  me  a  small  bouquet  for  my

world?

everyone  was  just  sitting  down  to
supper  when  i  got  home.  my  sisters  quit
the  table  for  the  candy.  i  told  them  to
divide it equally. the oldest one asked if i
wanted any of it.

“no,” i said. “i brought it all for you.”
of course, i didn’t tell them about the four

pieces i had in my pocket.

they  thanked  me  with  their  clear  blue

eyes.

i guess it’s pretty hard for a young boy
to fool his mama. she took one look at me
and  called  me  over.  she  ruffled  up  my
hair,  kissed  me,  and  said,  “if  my  little
boy’s eyes get any bigger they’re going to
pop  right  out  of  his  head.  now  tell  me,
what are you so happy about?”

before  i  could  say  anything,  papa
chuckled  and  asked,  “what’s  going  on
between you and your grandpa? what are
you and that old man cooking up now?”

as  fast  as  i  could  talk  i  started  telling
about  the  big  coon  hunt.  i  tol

sat there staring off into space, sipping his
coffee and saying nothing. i knew he was
thinking.

in  the  silence  i  was  sure  i  could  hear

my heart thumping.

i said, “papa, please go. we’ll have a
lot of fun and besides the winner receives
a big golden cup.”

he scratched his head and said, “billy,
i’d sure like to go, but i don’t see how i
can with all this work around here.”

i  was  beginning  to  think  that  papa
wasn’t  going  to  go.  then  mama  started
talking.

“work?”  she  said.  “why,  all  the  work

is  practically  done.  i  don’t  know  of  one
thing you couldn’t put off for a few days.
why  don’t  you  go?  you  haven’t  been

“it’s not only the work i’m thinking of,”

papa said. “it’s you and the girls.”

“why,  don’t  worry  about  the  girls  and
me,”  mama  said.  “we’ll  be  all  right.
besides, it’ll be several months yet before

help.”

when mama said this, it dawned on me.
i had been so busy with my coon hunting i
hadn’t  noticed  anything  unusual.  mama’s
tummy was all swelled up. she was going
to have a baby. i felt guilty for not having
noticed.  i  went  over  and  put  my  arms
around her and kissed her.

papa spoke up. “it’s sure going to be a
big  hunt,”  he  said.  “i  heard  something

about it up at the store one day.”

“grandpa  said  there  would  be  hunters
there from everywhere,” i said, “and some
of the best coon hounds in the country.”

“do you think you have a chance to win

the cup?” papa asked.

everyone was looking at papa and waiting
for his answer.

i  saw  a  pleased  smile  spread  over  his
face. he stood up. “all right, i’ll go,” he
said, “and, by golly, we’ll bring that gold
cup back, too.”

my sisters started clapping their hands
and  squealing  with  delight.  a  satisfied
smile spread over my mother’s face.

at  that  moment  i’m  sure  no  boy  in  the
world  could  have  been  happier  than  i.
tears  of  happiness  rolled  down  my
cheeks. mama wiped them away with her
apron.

in  the  midst  of  all  the  excitement,  my
little  sister,  saying  not  a  word,  climbed
down  from  her  chair.  no  one  said

anything. we just watched her.

still  clutching  a  spoon  in  her  small
hand,  she  came  around  the  table  and
walked  up  to  me.  looking  down  at  the
floor, in a bashful voice, she asked, “can i
have the gold cup?”

putting my finger under her sticky little
chin,  i  tilted  her  head  up.  i  smiled  as  i

“silly,  you  don’t  put  banty  eggs  in  a

that  night  i  dreamed  about  gold  cups,
little red hounds, and coons as big as rain
barrels. once i woke myself up whooping
to my dogs.

the  next  few  days  were  busy  ones  for
me.  knowing  that  papa  and  i  would  be
gone  for  several  days,  i  did  everything  i
could
things  convenient  for
mama. i chopped a large pile of wood and
stacked  it  close  to  the  kitchen  door.  to
make it easy for her to feed our stock, i cut
some poles from the hillside and boxed up
one of the stalls in the barn. i filled it full
of hay so she wouldn’t have to climb the
ladder to the loft.

papa  laid  down  the  law  to  my  sisters
about being good and helping mama while
we were gone.

as  nervous  as  a  june  bug  in  a  henhouse.
the  day  seemed  endless.

after  a  good  breakfast,  we  kissed

mama goodbye and started for the store.

i’m  sure  there  were  a  lot  of  coon
hunters in the ozarks, but on that morning
none could have felt as big and important
as  i.  walking  along  by  the  side  of  my
father, i threw out my chest and tried hard
to  keep  pace  with  his  long  strides.  he
noticed and laughed.

“you’ll  have  to  grow  a  little  bit,”  he
said, “before you can take steps that long.”

i didn’t say anything. i just smiled.

“now wait a minute. i’ve got another one
for  you  two.”  i  held  the  small  silver  cup
out to them.

while  they  were  fighting  over  it,  i  ran
to the little one. picking her up, i brushed
the snow from her long, braided hair and
her tear-stained face. i told her there was
no use to cry. i had brought the gold cup to
her, and no one else was going to get it.

reaching for the cup, she wrapped her
small arms around it. squeezing it up tight,
she ran for the house to show it to mama.
mama came out on the porch. she was
just as excited as the girls were. she held
out her arms. i ran to her. she hugged me

as  mama  took  the  beautiful  cup,  she
looked at me. she started to say something
but  was  interrupted  by  the  cries  from  the
other girls.

“we have one,

“two  cups!”  mama  exclaimed.  “did

you win two?”

the  awed  expression  on  my  mother’s
face was wonderful to see. holding a cup
in each hand, she held them out in front of
her.

“two,”  she  said.  “a  gold  one  and  a
silver  one.  who  would  have  thought
anything
could  have
happened  to  us.  i’m  so  proud;  so  very

with  a  smile  on  his  face,  papa  almost
shouted, “enjoy myself? why, i never had
such a time in my life.”

his  voice  trailed  off  to  a  low  calm,

“that  is,  except  for  one  thing.  grandpa
had a bad accident.”

“yes,  i  know,”  mama  said.  “one  of
tom logan’s boys was at the store when
they  arrived.  he  came  by  and  told  us  all
about it. the doctor said it wasn’t as bad
as  it  looked,  and  he  was  pretty  sure
grandpa would be home in a few days.”

i  was  happy  to  hear  this  news,  and
could  tell  by  the  pleased  look  on  my
father’s face, he was glad to hear it, too.

on entering the house, papa said, “oh, i
almost  forgot.”  he  handed  the  box  of
money to mama.

“what’s this?” sh

e asked.
“oh, it’s just a little gift from old dan

mama opened the box. i saw the color

walked  over  and  set  it  on  the  mantel. a
peaceful  silence  settled  over  the  room.  i
could  hear  the  clock  ticking  away.  the
fire in the fireplace crackled and popped.
turning from the mantel, mama looked
straight  at  us.  her  lips  were  tightly
pressed
them  from

buried  her  face  in  his  chest.  i  heard  her
say,  “thank  god,  my  prayers  have  been

there  was  a  celebration  in  our  home

the  smokehouse  and  came  back  with  a

that  each  wanted  to  claim  the  silver  cup.

sawing it in two, so each would have her
allotted  share,  papa  settled  the  squabble
by  giving  the  oldest  one  a  silver  dollar.
once  again  peace  and  harmony  was
restored.

that night as i was preparing for bed, a
light  flashed  by  my  window.  puzzled,  i
tiptoed over and peeked through the pane.

large  plates  heaped  high  with  food,  she
was heading for the doghouse. setting the

knowing  that  i  couldn’t  carry  him  and
the  ax  and  lantern,  i  stuck  the  ax  deep  in
the side of a white oak tree. i blew out the

lantern and hung the handle over the other
blade.  i  wrapped  my  dog  in  my  old
sheepskin coat and hurried for home.

arriving  home,  i  awakened  my  mother
and  father.  together  we  doctored  my
dogs.  old  dan  was  taken  care  of  first.
very gently mama worked the entrails out
and  in  a  pan  of  warm  soapy  water,
washed  them  clean  of  the  pine  needles,
leaves, and grit.

“if  i  only  knew  what  i  was  doing,”
mama  said,  as  she  worked,  “i’d  feel
better.”

with  gentle  hands,  she  worked  the
entrails  back  through  the  opening.  the
wound was sewn up and bandaged with a
clean white cloth.

and the best one i ever saw. he only has
two loves—you and hunting. that’s all he
knows.”

i told them how the lion had leaped at

“when  they  came  up  off  the  ground  they

there was a moaning sigh from mama.
she covered her face with her hands and
started crying.

“i  don’t  know,”  she  sobbed,  “i  just

to  being  killed.  i  don’t  think  i  can  stand

was a terrible rattling in his throat. i knelt
down and laid his head in my lap.

old  dan  must  have  known  he  was
dying.  just  before  he  drew  one  last  sigh,
and a feeble thump of his tail, his friendly
gray eyes closed forever.

at first i couldn’t believe my dog was
dead.  i  started  talking  to  him.  “please
don’t  die,  dan,”  i  said.  “don’t  leave  me

i  looked  to  mama  for  help.  her  face

heart.  she  opened  her  mouth  to  say
something but words wouldn’t come out.

ever forget something like that?”

mama  said,  “it’s  been  a  terrible  night
for all of us. let’s go to bed and try to get
some  rest.  maybe  we’ll  all  feel  better
tomorrow.”

“no, mama,” i said. “you and papa go
on to bed. i think i’ll stay up for a while. i
couldn’t sleep anyway.”

mama started to protest, but papa shook
his head. arm in arm they walked from the
room.

long  after  my  mother  and  father  had
retired, i sat by the fire trying to think and
couldn’t. i felt numb all over. i knew my

coming  up  through  our  barn  lot,  i  saw
my father feeding our stock. he came over
and said, “breakfast is about ready.”

“i  don’t  want  any  breakfast,  papa,”  i
said. “i’m not hungry and i have a job to
do. i’ll have to bury my dog.”

“i  tell  you  what,”  he  said,  “i’m  not
going to be very busy today, so let’s have
a good breakfast and then i’ll help you.”

“no, papa,” i said. “i’ll take care of it.
you go and eat breakfast. tell mama i’m
not hungry.”

i  saw  a  hurt  look  in  my  father’s  eyes.
shaking  his  head,  he  turned  and  walked
away.

from rough pine slabs, i made a box for
my dog. it was a crude box but it was the
best i could do. with strips of burlap and
corn shucks, i padded the inside.

up  on  the  hillside,  at  the  foot  of  a
beautiful  red  oak  tree,  i  dug  his  grave.
there  where  the  wild  mountain  flowers
would grow in the spring, i laid him away.
i  had  a  purpose  in  burying  my

the same place i had laid the body of old
dan. i covered her with gunny sacks.

all through the night i would get up and
check  on  her.  next  morning  i  took  warm
fresh  milk  and  again  i  opened  her  mouth
and  fed  her.  it  was  a  miserable  day  for
me. at noon it was the same. my dog had
just given up. there was no will to live.

no will to live.”

that  evening  when  i  came  in  from  the
fields,  she  was  gone.  i  hurried  to  my
mother. mama told me she had seen her go
up the hollow from the house, so weak she

could  hardly  stand.  mama  had  watched
her  until  she  had  disappeared  in  the
timber.

i  hurried  up  the  hollow,  calling  her
name. i called and called. i went up to the
head  of  it,  still  calling  her  name  and
praying she would come to me. i climbed
out onto the flats; looking, searching, and
calling. it was no use. my dog was gone.

i  had  a  thought,  a  ray  of  hope.  i  just
knew i’d find her at the

es gazed up into the heavens. in a
choking  voice,  i  asked,  “why  did  they
have  to  die?  why  must  i  hurt  so?  what
have i done wrong?”

i  heard  a  noise  behind  me.  it  was  my
mother.  she  sat  down  and  put  her  arm
around me.

“you’ve  done  no  wrong,  billy,”  she
said.  “i  know  this  seems  terrible  and  i
know  how  it  hurts,  but  at  one  time  or
another, everyone suffers. even the good

lord  suffered  while  he  was  here  on
earth.”

“i  know,  mama,”  i  said,  “but  i  can’t
understand.  it  was  bad  enough  when  old
dan died. now little ann is gone. both of
them gone, just like that.”

“billy,  you  haven’t  lost  your  dogs
altogether,”  mama  said.  “you’ll  always
have their memory. besides, you can have
some more dogs.”

i  rebelled  at  this.  “i  don’t  want  any
more  dogs,”  i  said.  “i  won’t  ever  want
another  dog.  they  wouldn’t  be  like  old
dan and little ann.”

“we all feel that w

ay, billy,” she said.
“i  do  especially.  they’ve  fulfilled  a
prayer  that  i  thought  would  never  be
answered.”

“i don’t believe in prayers any more,” i

said.  “i  prayed  for  my  dogs,  and  now
look, both of them are dead.”

mama was silent for a moment; then, in
a gentle voice, she said, “billy, sometimes
it’s hard to believe that things like this can
happen,  but  there’s  always  an  answer.
when  you’re  older,  you’ll  understand
better.”

“no,  i  won’t,”  i  said.  “i  don’t  care  if
i’m  a  hundred  years  old,  i’ll  never
understand why my dogs had to die.”

as  if  she  were  talking  to  someone  far
away,  i  heard  her  say  in  a  low  voice,  “i
don’t  know  what  to  say
 
 ___________________________
 
.  i  can’t  seem  to
find the right words.”

looking  up  to  her  face,  i  saw  that  her

eyes were flooded with tears.

“mama,  please  don’t  cry,”  i  said.  “i

didn’t mean what i said.”

“i  know  you  didn’t,”  she  said,  as  she
squeezed me up tight. “it’s just your way
of fighting back.”

i heard the voice of my father calling to

us from the house.

“come  now,”  mama  said.  “i  have
supper ready and your father wants to talk
to you. i think when you’ve heard what he
has to say, you’ll feel better.”

“i  can’t  leave  little  ann  like  this,
mama,”  i  said.  “it’ll  be  cold  tonight.  i
think i’ll carry her back to the house.”

“no, i don’t think you should do that,”
mama said. “your sisters would go all to
pieces. let’s make her comfortable here.”
raking  some  dead  leaves  into  a  pile,
she  picked  little ann  up  a

her body. i dreaded to think of what i had

to do on the morrow.

my father and sisters were waiting for
us on the porch. mama told them the sad
story. my sisters broke down and started
crying. they ran to mama and buried their
faces in her long cotton dress.

papa  came  over  and  laid  his  hand  on
my  shoulder.  “billy,”  he  said,  “there  are
times in a boy’s life when he has to stand
up like a man. this is one of those times. i
know what you’re going through and how
it hurts, but there’s always an answer. the
good lord has a reason for everything he
does.”

“there  couldn’t  be  any  reason  for  my
dogs  to  die,  papa,”  i  said.  “there  just
couldn’t.  they  hadn’

wrong.”

papa glanced at mama. getting no help

from  her,  he  said,  “it’s  getting  cold  out
here.  let’s  go  in  the  house.  i  have
something to show you.”

“guess what we’re having for supper,”
mama  said,  as  we  turned  to  enter  the
house. “your favorite, billy, sweet potato
pie. you’ll like that, won’t you?”

i nodded my head, but my heart wasn’t

in it.

papa  didn’t  follow  us  into  the  kitchen.

he turned and entered his bedroom.

when he came into the room, he had a
small  shoe  box  in  his  hand.  i  recognized
the  box  by  the  bright  blue  ribbon  tied
around it. mama kept her valuables in it.

a  silence  settled  over

the  room.

hills  and  into  town  so  that  you  children

i nodded my head.
“well,”  he  said,  in  a  low  voice,
“because  of  your  dogs,  her  prayers  have
been answered. this is the money earned
by old dan and little ann. i’ve managed
to make the farm feed us and clothe us and
i’ve saved every cent your furs brought in.
we now have enough.”

“isn’t  it  wonderful,”  mama  said.  “it’s

just like a miracle.”

“i  think  it  is  a  miracle,”  papa  said.
“remember, billy said a prayer when he
asked  for  his  pups  and  then  there  were
your prayers. billy got his pups. through
those  dogs  your  prayers  were  answered.
yes, i’m sure it is a miracle.”

“if he gave them to me, then why did he

take them away?” i asked.

“i think there’s an answer for that, too,”
papa  said.  “you  see,  billy,  your  mother
and i had decided not to s

always find the answers.

papa  could  see  that  his  talk  had  had
very little effect on me. with a sorrowful
look  on  his  face,  he  sat  down  and  said,
“now let us give thanks for our food and
for all the wonderful things god has done
for  us.  i’ll  say  a  special  prayer  and  ask
him to help billy.”

i barely heard what papa had to say.
during the meal, i could tell that no one
was enjoying the food. as soon as it was
over, i went to my room and lay down on
the bed.

mama  came  in.  “why  don’t  you  go  to
bed,”  she  said,  “and  get  a  good  night’s

sleep. you’ll feel better tomorrow.”

“no, i won’t, mama,” i said. “i’ll have

to bury little ann tomorrow.”

“i  know,”  she  said,  as  she  turned  my
covers  down.  “i’ll  help  if  you  want  me
to.”

“no,  mama,”  i  said,  “i  don’t  want
anyone  to  help.  i’d  rather  do  it  all  by
myself.”

“billy,  you’re  always  doing  things  by
yourself,”

mama  said.  “that’s  not  right.
everyone  needs  help  some  time  in  his
life.”

“i  know,  mama,”  i  said,”  but,  please,
not  this  time.  ever  since  my  dogs  were
puppies,  we’ve  always  been  together—
just  us  three.  we  hunted  together  and
played together. we even went swimming
together.

“did you know, mama, that little ann
used to come every night and peek in my
window  just  to  see  if  i  was  all  right?  i
guess  that’s  why  i  want  to  be  by  myself
when i bury her.”

“now say your prayers and go to sleep.
i’m sure you’ll feel better in the morning.”
i didn’t feel like saying any prayers that
night.  i  was  hurting  too  much.  long  after
the rest of the family had gone to bed, i lay
staring  into  the  darkness,  trying  to  think
and not able to.

 i got up, tiptoed
to  my  window,  and  looked  out  at  my
doghouse.  it  looked  so  lonely  and  empty
sitting there in the moonlight. i could see
that the door was slightly ajar. i thought of
the  many  times  i  had  lain  in  my  bed  and
listened to the squeaking of the door as my

dogs went in and out. i didn’t know i was
crying  until  i  felt  the  tears  roll  down  my
cheeks.

mama must have heard me get up. she
came  in  and  put  her  arms  around  me.
“billy,”  she  said,  in  a  quavering  voice,
“you’ll just have to stop this. you’re going
to  make  yourself  sick  and  i  don’t  think  i
can stand any more of it.”

after she had tucked me in, she sat on
the bed for a while. as if she were talking
to  the  darkness,  i  heard  her  say,  “if  only
there  were  some  way  i  could  help—

remembering  a  sandstone  ledge  i  had
seen  while  prowling  the  woods,  i  went
there. i picked out a nice stone and carried
it  back
the  graves.  then,  with
painstaking  care,  i  carved  their  names
deep in its red surface.

as i stood looking at the two graves, i
tried hard to understand some of the things
my  father  had  told  me,  but  i  couldn’t—i
was  still  hurting  and  still  had  that  empty
feeling.

i went to mama and had a talk with her.
“mama,”  i  asked,  “do  you  think  god

made a heaven for all good dogs?”

“yes,” she said, “i’m sure he did.”
“do you think he made a place for dogs
to  hunt?  you  know—just  like  we  have
here  on  our  place—with  mountains  and

sycamore trees, rivers and cornfields, and
old rail fences? do you think he did?”

“from  what  i’ve  read  in  the  good
book,  billy,”  she  said,  “he  put  far  more
things  up  there  than  we  have  here.  yes,
i’m sure he did.

“i’m  glad,”  she  said,  as  she  patted  my
head. “i don’t like to see my little boy hurt
like this.”

i  was  thinking  this  over  when  mama
came up to me and started tucking my shirt
in. “do you feel better now?” she asked.

“it still hurts, mama,” i said, as i buried
my face in her dress, “but i do feel a little
better.”

the  following  spring  we  left  the  ozarks.  the
day we moved i thought everyone would be
sad,  but  it  was  just  the  opposite.  mama
seemed  to  be  the  happiest  one  of  all.  i
could  hear  her  laughing  and  joking  with
my sisters as they packed things. she had a
glow in her eyes i had never seen before
and it made me feel good.

i  even  noticed  a  change  in  papa.  he
didn’t have that whipped look on his face
any  more.  he  was  in  high  spirits  as  we
carried the furniture out to our wagon.

after  the  last  item  was  stored  in  the
wagon,  papa  helped  mama  to  the  spring
seat and we were ready to go.

graves of my dogs.

i had heard the old indian legend about
the red fern. how a little indian boy and
girl were lost in a blizzard and had frozen
to  death.  in  the  spring,  when  they  were
found,  a  beautiful  red  fern  had  grown  up
between their two bodies. the story went
on to say that only an angel could plant the
seeds  of  a  red  fern,  and  that  they  never
died;  where  one  grew,  that  spot  was
sacred.

remembering

the
legend,  i  turned  and  started  hollering  for
mama.

the  meaning  of

“what is it, billy? are you all right?”

“mama!  mama!”  i  shouted.  “come

here! and hurry! you won’t believe it.”

in a frightened voice, she shouted back,

“i’m  all  right,  mama,”  i  shouted,  “but

hurry. you just won’t believe it.”

holding  her  long  skirt  in  her  hand  and
with a frightened look on her face, mama
came puffing up the hillside. close behind
her came papa and my sisters.

“what  is  it,  billy?”  mama  asked,  in  a

 
 ___________________________
 

scared voice. “are you all right?”

“look!” i said, pointing at the red fern.
staring  wide-eyed,  mama  gasped  and
covered her mouth with her hand. i heard
her  say,  almost  in  a  whisper,  “oh-h-h-h,
it’s a red fern—a sacred red fern.”

she  walked  over  and  very  tenderly
started fingering the long red leaves. in an
awed  voice,  she  said,  “all  my  life  i’ve
wanted to see one. now i have. it’s almost
unbelievable.”

“don’t  touch  it,  mama,”  my  oldest

sister  whispered.  “it  was  planted  by  an
angel.”

mama  smiled  and  asked,  “have  you

heard the legend?”

“yes,  mama,”  my

said.
“grandma told me the story, and i believe
it, too.”

with  a  serious  look  on  his  face,  papa
said, “these hills are full of legends. up
until  now  i’ve  never  paid  much  attention
to  them,  but  now  i  don’t  know.  perhaps
there is something to the legend of the red
fern. maybe this is god’s way of

billy understand why his dogs died.”

“i’m sure it is, papa,” i said, “and i do
understand.  i  feel  different  now,  and  i
don’t hurt any more.”

“come,” mama said, “let’s go back to
the  wagon.  billy  wants  to  be  alone  with

his dogs for a while.”

just  as  they  turned  to  leave,  i  heard
papa murmur in a low voice, “wonderful
indeed is the work of our lord.”

as i stood looking at the two graves, i
noticed  things  i  hadn’t  seen  before.  wild
violets,  rooster  heads,  and  mountain
daisies  had  completely  covered  the  two
little  mounds.  a  summer  breeze  gushed
down from the rugged hills. i felt its warm
caress as it

gently in the warm summer breeze.

something  scurried  across  the  vacant
yard  and  disappeared  under  the  barn.  it
was samie, our house cat. i heard my little
sister  say  in  a  choking  voice,  “mommie,
we forgot samie.”

“see what, mama?” i asked.
“the red fern,” she said.
my  oldest  sister  spoke  up.  “i  can  see

there was no answer.

rubbing  my  eyes,  i  looked  to  the

ur home. there it stood in
all its wild beauty, a waving red banner in
a carpet of green. it seemed to be saying,
“good-bye,  and  don’t  worry,  for  i’ll  be
here always.”

hearing a sniffling, i turned around. my
three  little  sisters  had  started  crying.
mama said something to papa. i heard the
jingle of the trace chains as they tightened
in the singletrees.
