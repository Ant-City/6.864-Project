his arrows drooped not with feathers low;
and in his hand he bare a mighty bow.

 lines appended to the tale of the nun's priest
seem, as tyrwhitt observes, to commence the prologue to the
succeeding tale -- but the difficulty is to determine which that
tale should be. in earlier editions, the lines formed the opening
of the prologue to the manciple's tale; but most of the
manuscripts acknowledge themselves defective in this part, and
give the nun's tale after that of the nun's priest. in the harleian
manuscript, followed by mr wright, the second nun's tale, and
the canon's yeoman's tale, are placed after the franklin's tale;
and the sixteen lines above are not found -- the manciple's
prologue coming immediately after the "amen" of the nun's
priest. in two manuscripts, the last line of the sixteen runs thus:
"said unto the nun as ye shall hear;" and six lines more
evidently forged, are given to introduce the nun's tale.  all this
confusion and doubt only strengthen the certainty, and deepen
the regret, that "the canterbury tales" were left at chaucer's,

and underneath he wore a white surplice.

eaf* he had laid  under his hood,                * burdock-leaf
for sweat, and for to keep his head from heat.
but it was joye for to see him sweat;
his forehead dropped as a stillatory*                             *still

because that i would you overtake,
to riden in this merry company."
his yeoman was eke full of courtesy,
and saide, "sirs, now in the morning tide
out of your hostelry i saw you ride,
and warned here my lord and sovereign,
which that to ride with you is full fain,
for his disport; he loveth dalliance."

and when this yeoman had this tale told
unto our host, he said; "ben'dicite!

that we may not, although we had it sworn,

while this yeoman was thus in his talking,
this canon drew him near, and heard all thing
which this yeoman spake, for suspicion
of menne's speech ever had this canon:

and when this canon saw it would not be

but natheless yet will i telle part;

notes to the prologue to the canon's yeoman's tale


1. "the introduction," says tyrwhitt, "of the canon's
yeoman to tell a tale at a time when so many of the original
characters remain to be called upon, appears a little
extraordinary. it should seem that some sudden resentment
had determined chaucer to interrupt the regular course of his
work, in order to insert a satire against the alchemists. that
their pretended science was much cultivated about this time,
and produced its usual evils, may fairly be inferred from the
act, which was passed soon after, 5 h. iv. c. iv., to make it
felony 'to multiply gol
 
 ___________________________
 
d or silver, or to use the art of
multiplication.'" tyrwhitt finds in the prologue some colour
for the hypothesis that this tale was intended by chaucer to
begin the return journey from canterbury; but against this
must be set the fact that the yeoman himself expressly speaks
of the distance to canterbury yet to be ridden.

2. fully five mile:  from some place which the loss of the
second nun's prologue does not enable us to identify.

3. peytrel: the breast-plate of a horse's harness; french,
"poitrail."

4. a maile twyfold:  a double valise; a wallet hanging across
the crupper on either side of the horse.

5. multiply:  transmute metals, in the attempt to multiply gold
and silver by alchemy.

note to the canon's yeoman's tale


1.  the tale of the canon's yeoman, like those of the wife of
bath and the pardoner, is made up of two parts; a long
general introduction, and the story proper. in the case of the
wife of bath, the interruptions of other pilgrims, and the
autobiographical nature of the discourse, recommend the
separation of the prologue from the tale proper; but in the
other cases the introductory or merely connecting matter
ceases wholly where the opening of "the tale" has been
marked in the text.

"well, sir," quoth he, "now hearken what i say."


notes to the prologue to the manciple's tale


1. bob-up-and-down: mr wright supposes this to be the village of
harbledown, near canterbury, which  is situated on a hill, and near
which there are many ups and downs in the road. like boughton,
where the canon and his yeoman overtook the pilgrims, it stood on
the skirts of the kentish forest of blean or blee.

2. dun is in the mire: a proverbial saying. "dun" is a name for an
ass, derived from his colour.

3. the mention of the cook here, with no hint that he had already
told a story, confirms the indication given by the imperfect
condition of his tale, that chaucer intended to suppress the tale
altogether, and make him tell a story in some other place.

wrecked. the goddess promised the hero immortality if he

45. hermes ballenus: this is supposed to mean hermes
trismegistus (of whom see note 19 to the canon's yeoman's
tale); but the explanation of the word "ballenus" is not quite
obvious. the god hermes of the greeks (mercurius of the
romans) had the surname "cyllenius," from the mountain
where he was born -- mount cyllene, in arcadia; and the
alteration into "ballenus" would be quite within the range of a
copyist's capabilities, while we find in the mythological
character of hermes enough to warrant his being classed with
jugglers and magicians.

8. gardebrace: french, "garde-bras," an arm-shield; probably
