t thousand. latecomers are di-
rected to the adjacent streets, where they can watch the event 
on screens as it’s televised live by the state. 
i find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the seam. 
we all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the 
temporary stage that is set up before the justice building. it 
holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for 
the boys and one for the girls. i stare at the paper slips in the 
girls’ ball. twenty of them have katniss everdeen written on 
them in careful handwriting. 
two of the three chairs fill with madge’s father, mayor un-
dersee, who’s a tall, balding man, and effie trinket, district 
12’s escort, fresh from the capitol with her scary white grin, 
pinkish hair, and spring green suit. they murmur to each oth-
er and then look with concern at the empty seat. 
just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to 
the podium and begins to read. it’s the same story every year. 
he tells of the history of

gale has lifted prim off the ground and she’s thrashing in his 
arms. “up you go, catnip,” he says, in a voice he’s fighting to 
keep steady, and then he carries prim off toward my mother. i 
steel myself and climb the steps. 
“well, bravo!” gushes effie trinket. “that’s the spirit of the 
games!” she’s pleased to finally have a district with a little ac-
tion going on in it. “what’s your name?” 
i swallow hard. “katniss everdeen,” i say. 
“i bet my buttons that was your sister. don’t want her to 
steal all the glory, do we? come on, everybody! let’s give a big 
round of applause to our newest tribute!” trills effie trinket. 
to the everlasting credit of the people of district 12, not 
one person claps. not even the ones holding betting slips, the 
ones who are usually beyond caring. possibly because they

instead he’s been very solitary, speaking 
to no one, showing little interest in training. even so, he 
scored a ten and it’s not hard to imagine he impressed the 
gamemakers. he ignores caesar’s attempts at banter and an-
swers with a yes or no or just remains silent. 
if only i was his size, i could get away with sullen and hos-
tile and it would be just fine! i bet half the sponsors are at 
least considering him. if i had any money, i’d bet on him my-
self. and then they’re calling katniss everdeen, and i feel myself, 
as if in a dream, standing and making my way center stage. i

shake caesar’s outstretched hand, and he has the good grace 
not to immediately wipe his off on his suit. 
“so, katniss, the capitol must be quite a change from dis-
trict twelve. what’s impressed you most since you arrived 
here?” asks caesar. 
what? what did he say? it’s as if the words make no sense. 
my mouth has gone as dry as sawdust. i desperately find

“it’s not good,” agrees peeta. 
“well, i don’t think any of us can blame you. it’d be hard not 
to fall for that young lady,” says caesar. “she didn’t know?” 
peeta shakes his head. “not until now.” 
i allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to 
see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable. 
“wouldn’t you love to pull her back out here and get a re-
sponse?” caesar asks the audience. the crowd screams assent. 
“sadly, rules are rules, and katniss everdeen’s time has been 
spent. well, best of luck to you, peeta mellark, and i think i 
speak for all of panem when i say our hearts go with yours.” 
the roar of the crowd is deafening. peeta has absolutely 
wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love

front of the television to watch a replay of the interview. with 
the capitol growing farther away every second, i begin to 
think of home. of prim and my mother. of gale. i excuse my-
self to change out of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants. 
as i slowly, thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and 
put my hair in its braid, i begin transforming back into myself.

katniss everdeen. a girl who lives in the seam. hunts in the 
woods. trades in the hob. i stare in the mirror as i try to re-
member who i am and who i am not. by the time i join the 
others, the pressure of peeta’s arm around my shoulders feels 
alien. when the train makes a brief stop for fuel, we’re allowed to 
go outside for some fresh air. there’s no longer any need to 
guard us. peeta and i walk down along the track, hand in hand, 
and i can’t find anything to say now that we’re alone. he stops
