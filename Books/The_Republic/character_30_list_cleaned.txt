[CHARACTER] - 
                 plato
divides existence up into two realms, the [CHARACTER] and the
intelligible realm. the [CHARACTER] can be grasped with our senses.
it is comprised of the world see around us--the world of sensible
particulars. the objects which comprise the [CHARACTER] are not
as real as those which comprise the intelligible realm; in addition,
they are not the proper objects of knowledge (i.e., we cannot "know"
anything about them), but of opinion.
