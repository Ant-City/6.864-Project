 and for the first time palm-oil and kernel became
things of great price, and much money flowed into umuofia.

and even in the matter of religion there was a growing feeling that
there might be something in it after all, something vaguely akin to
method in the overwhelming madness.

this growing feeling was due to mr. brown, the white missionary,
who was very firm in restraining his flock from provoking the
wrath of the clan. one member in particular was very difficult to
restrain. his name was enoch and his father was the priest of the



snake cult. the story went around that enoch had killed and eaten
the sacred python, and that his father had cursed him.



mr. brown preached against such excess of zeal. everything was
possible, he told his energetic flock, but everything was not
expedient. and so mr. brown came to be respected even by the
clan, because he trod softly on its faith. he made friends with some
of the great men of the clan and on one of his frequent visits to the
neighbori

dren who were not deterred
by mutilation, but came back with all the scars. he replied that
such stories were spread in the world by the devil to lead men
astray. those who believed such stories were unworthy of the
lord's table.



there was a saying in umuofia that as a man danced so the drums
were beaten for him. mr. smith danced a furious step and so the
drums went mad. the over-zealous converts who had smarted
under mr. brown's restraining hand now flourished in full favor.
one of them was enoch, the son of the snake-priest who was
believed to have killed and eaten the sacred python. enoch's
devotion to the new faith had seemed so much greater than mr.
brown's that the villagers called him the outsider who wept louder
than the bereaved.

enoch was short and slight of build, and always seemed in great
haste. his feet were short and broad, and when he stood or walked
his heels came together and his feet opened outwards as if they had
quarreled and meant to go in different directions. suc

excessive energy bottled up in

enoch's small body that it was always erupting in quarrels and
fights. on sundays he always imagined that the sermon was
preached for the benefit of his enemies. and if he happened to sit
near one of them he would occasionally turn to give him a
meaningful look, as if to say, "i told you so." it was enoch who
touched off the great conflict between church and clan in umuofia
which had been gathering since mr. brown left.

it happened during the annual ceremony which was held in honor
of the earth deity. at such times the ancestors of the clan who had



been committed to mother earth at their death emerged again as
egwugwu through tiny ant-holes.



one of the greatest crimes a man could commit was to unmask an
egwugwu in public, or to say or do anything which might reduce its
immortal prestige

in the eyes of the uninitiated. and this was what
enoch did.

the annual worship of the earth goddess fell on a sunday, and the
masked spirits were abroad. the christian women who had been to
church could not therefore go home. some of their men had gone
out to beg the egwugwu to retire for a short while for the women to
pass. they agreed and were already retiring, when enoch boasted
aloud that they would not dare to touch a christian. whereupon
they all came back and one of them gave enoch a good stroke of
the cane, which was always carried. enoch fell on him and tore off
his mask. the other egwugwu immediately surrounded their
desecrated companion, to shield him from the profane gaze ol
women and children, and led him away. enoch had killed an
ancestral spirit, and umuofia was thrown into confusion.

that night the mother of the spirits walked the length and breadth
of the clan, weeping for her murdered son. it was a terrible night.
not even the oldest man in umuofia had ever he

it was a terrible gathering. the eerie voices of countless spirits, the
bells that clattered behind some of them, and the clash of machetes
as they ran forwards and backwards and saluted one another, sent




tremors of fear into every heart. for the first time in living memory
the sacred bull-roarer was heard in broad daylight.

from the marketplace the furious band made for enoch's
compound. some of the elders of the clan went with them, wearing
heavy protections of charms and amulets. these were men whose
arms were strong in ogwu, or medicine. as for the ordinary men
and women, they listened from the safety of their huts.

the leaders of the christians had met together at mr. smith's
parsonage on the previous night. as they deliberated they could
hear the mother of spirits wailing for her son. the chilling sound
affected mr. smith, and for the first time he seemed to b

ing to do?" he asked. no one knew, because
such a thing had never happened before. mr. smith

would have sent for the district commissioner and his court
messengers, but they had gone on tour on the previous day.

"one thing is clear," said mr. smith. "we cannot offer physical
resistance to them. our strength lies in the lord." they knelt down
together and prayed to god for delivery.

"o lord, save thy people," cried mr. smith.

"and bless thine inheritance," replied the men.

they decided that enoch should be hidden in the parsonage for a
day or two. enoch himself was greatly disappointed when he heard
this, for he had hoped that a holy war was imminent,- and there
were a few other christians who thought like him. but wisdom
prevailed in the camp of the faithful and many lives were thus
saved.

the band of egwugwu moved like a furious whirlwind to enoch's
compound and with machete and fire reduced it to a desolate heap.

e went down the two steps that led up to the church and
walked towards the approaching spirits.

they surged forward, and a long stretch of the bamboo fence with
which the church compound was surrounded gave way before
them. discordant bells clanged, machetes clashed and the air was
full of dust and weird sounds. mr. smith heard a sound of footsteps
behind him. he turned round and saw okeke, his interpreter.
okeke had not been on the best of terms with his master since he
had strongly condemned enoch's behavior at the meeting of the
leaders ol the church during the night. okeke had gone as far as to
say that enoch should not be hidden in the parsonage, because he
would only draw the wrath of the clan on the pastor. mr. smith had
rebuked him in very strong language, and had not sought his
advice that morning. but now, as he came up and stood by him
confronting the angry spirits, mr. smith looked at him and smiled.
it was a wan smile, but there was deep gratitude there.

"wait a minute," said the commissioner. "i want to bring in my
men so that they too can hear your grievances and take warning.
many of them come from distant places and although they speak
your tongue they are ignorant of your customs. james! go and
bring in the men." his interpreter left the courtroom and soon
returned with twelve men. they sat together with the men of
umuofia, and ogbuefi ekwueme began to tell the story of how
enoch murdered an egwugwu.

it happened so quickly that the six men did not see it coming.
there was only a brief scuffle, too brief even to allow the drawing
of a sheathed machete. the six men were handcuffed and led into
the guardroom.

"we shall not do you any harm," said the district commissioner to
them later, "if only you agree to cooperate with us. we have
brought a peaceful administration to you and your people so that
you may be happy. if any man ill-treats you we shall come to your
rescue.
