[CHARACTER] 
 - 
                blifil is antagonist to tom jones and the son of bridget allworthy and captain 
blifil. although he appears at first to be a virtuous character, his hypocrisy 
soon exposes itself--blifil pretends to be pious and principled, but greed 
governs him. the fact that blifil has few redeeming qualities makes tom 
compassion for him at the end of the novel--after the revelation that 
blifil kept the secret of tom's birth to himself--even more commendable. 
blifil's dearth of natural human appetites--he at first does not desire 
sophia--does not distinguish him as a virtuous character, but rather 
provides a depressing picture of what humanity would be like if devoid of 
passion.
