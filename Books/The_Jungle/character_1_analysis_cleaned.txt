[CHARACTER]
like jurgis, ona is more a type than an individual, and
sinclair constructs her as an appealing feminine contrast to jurgis's
masculinity. whereas jurgis is confident and optimistic, ona is
fragile and easily frightened, as when she frets over the cost of
the wedding feast mere moments after marrying jurgis. ona is extremely
young--not even sixteen at the start of the novel--and is presented
as a delicate, lovely picture of female traits that sinclair believed
his readers would find laudable: docility, loyalty, and trust in
her husband and family. ona experiences a crisis when phil connor
rapes her, and she takes on a more independent existence when she
lies to jurgis about her whereabouts so that he will not guess what
has happened to her. but generally, throughout the novel, ona is
mainly portrayed as a girl for jurgis to love and a wife to complete
the family ideal that sinclair repeatedly exposes to the destructive
forces of capitalism. ona's death occurs in chapter 19, only
slightly more than halfway through the novel, and her final months
are largely a slide into increased fragility and poor health caused
by her return to work only a week after giving birth to antanas.
in this way, ona's death is portrayed as another sacrifice that
jurgis must make to capitalism, which pulls his family apart before
he can even fully establish it.
