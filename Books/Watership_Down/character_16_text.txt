they both ate seeds and flies. and the fox and the rabbit were friends and they
both ate grass. and there was plenty of grass and plenty of flies, because the
world was new and frith shone down bright and warm all day.
     "now, el-ahrairah was among the animals in those days and he had many
wives. he had so many wives that there was no counting them, and the wives had
so many young that even frith could not count them, and they ate the grass and
the dandelions and the lettuces and the clover, and el-ahrairah was the father of
them all." (bigwig growled appreciatively.) "and after a time," went on
dandelion, "after a time the grass began to grow thin and the rabbits wandered
everywhere, multiplying and eating as they went.
     "then frith said to el-ahrairah, 'prince rabbit, if you cannot control your
people, i shall find ways to control them. so mark what i say.' but el-ahrairah
would not listen and he said to frith, 'my people are the strongest in the world,
for they breed faster

e wheatfield, the very picture
of rabbits in an evening landscape. hazel, tired though he was, did not forget to
look for somewhere to bolt if there should be an alarm. he was lucky enough to
come upon a short length of old, overgrown ditch, partly fallen in and so heavily
overhung with cow parsley and nettles that it was almost as sheltered as a tunnel;
and all four of them made sure that they could reach it quickly from the open.
     "that'll be good enough at a pinch," said bigwig, munching clover and sniffing
at the fallen bloom from a wayfaring tree. "my goodness, we've learned a few
things since we left the old warren, haven't we? more than we'd have learned in a
lifetime back there. and digging! it'll be flying next, i suppose. have you noticed
that this soil's quite different from the soil in the old warren? it smells differently
and it slides and falls quite differently, too."
     "that reminds me," said hazel. "i meant to ask you. there was one thing at
that terrible warren of co

've been talking to another mouse. he'd heard
about the kestrel this evening and was very friendly. he told us about a place just
the other side of the wood where the grass has been cut short -- something to do
with horses, he said. 'you like a nice a grass? 'e very fine grass.' so we went there.
it's first-rate."
     the gallop turned out to be a good forty yards wide, mown to less than six
inches. hazel, with a delightful sense of having been proved right by events, set to
work on a patch of clover. they all munched for some time in silence.
     "you're a clever chap, hazel," said holly at last "you and your mouse. mind
you, we'd have found the place ourselves sooner or later, but not as soon as this."
     hazel could have pressed his chin glands for satisfaction, but he replied
merely, "we shan't need to go down the hill so much, after all." then he added,
"but, holly, you smell of blood, you know. it may be dangerous, even here. let's
go back to the wood. it's such a beautiful night t

ass."
     "i have come to tell you about my warren. we need more rabbits. we want you
to run away from the farm and join us."
     "there's a wire door at the back of this hutch," said boxwood. "come down
there: we can talk more easily."
     the door was made of wire netting on a wooden frame, with two leather hinges

nailed to the uprights and a hasp and staple fastened with a twist of wire. four
rabbits were crowded against the wire, pressing their noses through the mesh.
two -- laurel and clover -- were short-haired black angoras. the others,
boxwood and his doe haystack, were black-and-white himalayans.
     hazel began to speak about the life of the downs and the excitement and
freedom enjoyed by wild rabbits. in his usual straightforward way he told about
the predicament of his warren in having no does and how he had come to look for
some. "but," he said, "we don't want to steal your does. all four of you are
welcome to join us, bucks and does alike. there's plenty for everyone on t

hills." he went on to talk of the evening feed in the sunset and of early morning in
the long grass.
     the hutch rabbits seemed at once bewildered and fascinated. clover, the
angora doe -- a strong, active rabbit -- was clearly excited by hazel's description
and asked several questions about the warren and the downs. it became plain
that they thought of their life in the hutch as dull but safe. they had learned a
good deal about elil from some source or other and seemed sure that few wild
rabbits survived for long. hazel realized that although they were glad to talk to
him and welcomed his visit because it brought a little excitement and change into
their monot

you other three, keep watching. if another cat comes, you'll have to take it on
yourselves."
     "fine," said dandelion. "just leave it to us."
     bigwig and blackberry found the straw bale and climbed on the planks. as they
did so, boxwood spoke from the hutch.
     "who's that? hazel-rah, have you come back?"
     "hazel-rah has sent us," answered blackberry. "we've come to let you out. will
you come with us?"
     there was a pause and some movement in the hay and then clover replied,
"yes, let us out."
     blackberry sniffed his way round to the wire door and sat up, nosing over the
frame, the hasp and the staple. it took him some time to realize that the leather
hinges were soft enough to bite. then he found that they lay so smooth and flush
with the frame that he could not get his teeth to them. several times he tried to
find a grip and at last sat back on his haunches, at a loss.
     "i don't think this door's going to be any good," he said. "i wonder whether

growling.
     "well, you said magic, didn't you?" said blackberry with satisfaction. "do it
again."
     no strip of leather held by only one broad-headed nail at each end can stand
up for long to repeated twisting. soon one of the nailheads was almost out of
sight under the frayed edges.
     "careful now," said blackberry. "if it gives way suddenly, you'll go flying. just
pull it off with your teeth."
     two minutes later the door hung sagging on the staple alone. clover pushed
the hinge side open and came out, followed by boxwood.
     when several creatures -- men or animals -- have worked together to overcome
something offering resistance and have at last succeeded, there follows often a
pause -- as though they felt the propriety of paying respect to the adversary who
has put up so good a fight. the great tree falls, splitting, cracking, rushing down
in leaves to the final, shuddering blow along the ground. then the foresters are
silent, and do not at once s

whatever and no means of forming one. they had no more idea of what was
involved than a small child who says he will accompany the climbers up the fell.
     blackberry's heart sank. what was to be done with them? left to themselves,
they would hop slowly about the shed and the yard until the cats got them. of
their own accord they could no more run to the hills than fly to the moon. was
there no simple, plain idea that might get them -- or some of them -- on the
move? he turned to clover.
     "i don't suppose you've ever eaten grass by night," he said. "it tastes much
better than by day. let's all go and have some, shall we?"
     "oh, yes," said clover, "i'd like that. but will it be safe? we're all very much
afraid of the cats, you know. they come and stare at us sometimes through the
wire and it makes us shiver."
     this showed at least the beginnings of sense, thought blackberry.
     "the big rabbit is a match for any cat," he replied. "he nearly killed one on the

t another if he can help it" said bigwig briskly. "so
if you do want to eat grass by moonlight, let's go to where hazel-rah's waiting for
us."
     as bigwig led the way into the yard, he could make out the shape of the cat that
he had beaten, watching from the woodpile. cat-like, it was fascinated by the
rabbits and could not leave them alone, but it evidently had no stomach for
another fight and as they crossed the yard it stayed where it was.
     the pace was frighteningly slow. boxwood and clover seemed to have grasped
that there was some sort of urgency and were clearly doing their best to keep up,
but, the other two rabbits, once they had hopped into the yard, sat up and looked
about them in a foolish manner, completely at a loss. after a good deal of delay,
during which the cat left the woodpile and began to move stealthily round toward
the side of the shed, blackberry managed to get them out into the farmyard. but
here, finding themselves in an even more open place, they settled int

gwig's orders.
at this moment a second cat -- hazel's tabby -- came round the further end of the
farmhouse and made toward them. as it passed the kennel the labrador woke
and sat up, thrusting out its head and shoulders and looking first to one side and
then the other. it saw the rabbits, ran to the length of its rope and began to bark.
     "come on!" said bigwig. "we can't stay here. up the lane, everybody, and
quickly, too." blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit ran at once, taking boxwood

and clover with them into the darkness under the barn. dandelion remained
beside haystack, begging her to move and expecting every moment to feel the
cat's claws in his back. bigwig leaped across to him.
     "dandelion," he said in his ear, "get out of it, unless you want to be killed!"
     "but the--" began dandelion.
     "do as i say!" said bigwig. the noise of barking was fearful and he himself was
close to panic. dandelion hesitated a moment longer. then he left haystack and
shot up the lane, with

     they found the others gathered round hazel, under the bank. boxwood and
clover were trembling and seemed exhausted. hazel was talking to them
reassuringly, but broke off as bigwig appeared out of the dark. the dog stopped
barking and there was quiet.
     "we're all here," said bigwig. "shall we go, hazel?"
     "but there were four hutch rabbits," said hazel. "where are the other two?"
     "in the farmyard," said blackberry. "we couldn't do anything with them: and
then the dog began to bark."
     "yes, i heard it. you mean they're loose?"
     "they'll be a lot looser

 day, for a change? it's a lovely evening, if my nose says right. we ought to
try not to be more miserable than we can help, you know."
     "just before we silflay," said bigwig, "can i tell you, holly, that i don't believe
anyone else could have brought himself and three other rabbits safely back out of
a place like that?"
     "frith meant us to get back," replied holly. "that's the real reason why we're
here."
     as he turned to follow speedwell up the run that led into the wood, he found
clover beside him. "you and your friends must find it strange to go outside and
eat grass," he said. "you'll get used to it, you know. and i can promise you that
hazel-rah was right when he told you it's a better life here than in a hutch. come
with me and i'll show you a patch of nice, short tail-grass, if bigwig hasn't had it
all while i've been away."
     holly had taken to clover. she seemed more robust and less timid than
boxwood and haystack and was evidently doing her best to adapt herself to

warren life. what her stock might be he could not tell, but she looked healthy.
     "i like it underground all right," said clover, as they came up into the fresh air.
"the closed space is really very much like a hutch, except that it's darker. the
difficult thing for us is going to be feeding in the open. we're not used to being
free to go where we like and we don't know what to do. you all act so quickly and
half the time i don't know why. i'd prefer not to feed very far from the hole, if you
don't mind."
     they moved slowly across the sunset grass, nibbling as they went: clover was
soon absorbed in feeding, but holly

 -- ideas of protection, fidelity, romantic love and so on -- are,
of course, unknown to rabbits, although rabbits certainly do form exclusive
attachments much more frequently than most people realize. however, they are
not romantic and it came naturally to hazel and holly to consider the two
nuthanger does simply as breeding stock for the warren. this was what they had
risked their lives for.
     "well, it's hard to say, yet," replied holly. "they're doing their best to settle
down with us -- clover particularly. she seems very sensible. but they're
extraordinarily helpless, you know -- i've never seen anything like it -- and i'm
afraid they may turn out to be delicate in bad weather. they might survive next
winter and then again they might not. but you weren't to know that when you got
them out of the farm."
     "with a bit of luck, they might each have a litter before the winter," said hazel.
"i know the breeding season's over, but everything's so topsy-turvy with us here
that there's n

but it's dangerous. the other two i can't see at all yet and i'd like to talk it over
with fiver."
     "the sooner fiver and i get back to the warren the better," said hazel. "my
leg's good enough now, but all the same i think we'll leave it for tonight. good old
holly, will you tell them that fiver and i will come early tomorrow morning? it
worries me to think that bigwig and silver may start fighting about clover at any
moment."
     "hazel," said holly, "listen. i don't like this idea of yours at all. i've been in
efrafa and you haven't. you're making a bad mistake and you might very well get
us all killed."
     it was fiver who replied. "it ought to feel like that, i know," he said, "but
somehow it doesn't: not to me. i believe we can do it. anyway, i'm sure hazel's
right when he says it's the only chance we've got. suppose we go on talking about

a spinney adjoining the
southern edge of caesar's belt. to the west again was a shallow, dry downland
combe, perhaps four hundred yards across and overgrown with weeds and rough,
yellowing summer tussocks. there, well before sunset, kehaar, flying westward
down the belt, spotted the rabbits lying up, all among the nettles and goose grass.
he sailed down and alighted near hazel and fiver.
     "how's holly?" asked hazel.
     "'e sad," said kehaar. "'e say you no come back." then he added, "mees clover,
she ready for mudder."
     "that's good," said hazel. "is anyone doing anything about it?"
     "ya, ya, ees all to fight."
     "oh, well, i suppose it'll sort itself out."
     "vat you do now, meester 'azel?"
     "this is where you start helping, kehaar. we need a place to hide, as near the
big warren as we can safely get -- somewhere where those other rabbits won't find
us. if you know the country well enough, perhaps you can suggest something."

 sentries who was close by, chervil told him to go
round the burrows and send everyone up for silflay.
     "now," he said, "avens, you go to the further hole as usual, and thlayli can join
me on the nearer one. we'll send four sentries out to the line, to start with, and
when the mark have all gone out we'll add four more and keep two in reserve. i'll
see you in the usual place, by the big flint in the bank."
     bigwig followed chervil along the run, down which came the scents of warm
grass, clover and hop trefoil. he had found most of the runs closer and stuffier
than he was used to, no doubt because there were so few holes into the open air.
the prospect of an evening silflay, even in efrafa, was pleasant. he thought of the
beech leaves rustling above the far-off honeycomb, and sighed. "i wonder how
old holly's getting on," he thought, "and whether i'll ever see him again: or hazel
either, for the matter of that. well, i'll give these blighters something to think
about before i've finis

     "fine -- fine. dey say you damn good fella. meester pluebell, 'e say to pring one
mudder for everyone else and two for 'im."
     bigwig was trying to think of some appropriate reply to this when he saw
chervil running across the grass toward him. at once, without speaking again to
kehaar, he took a few hops in chervil's direction and began biting busily at a
patch of clover. as chervil came up, kehaar flew low above their heads and
disappeared over the trees.
     chervil looked after the flying gull and then turned to bigwig.
     "aren't you afraid of those birds?" he asked.
     "not particularly," answered bigwig.
     "they sometimes attack mice, you know, and rabbit kittens, too," said chervil.
"you were taking a risk, feeding there. why were you so careless?"
     for answer, bigwig sat up and gave chervil a playful cuff, hard enough to roll
him over.

tincts were blurred and not to be trusted. it was a time to
crouch and be silent. but a fugitive would be safe. indeed, he could not hope for a
better chance.
     "o lord with the starlight ears, send me a sign!" said bigwig.
     he heard movement in the run behind him. it was the owslafa bringing up the
prisoner. in the thundery twilight, blackavar looked more sick and dejected than
ever. his nose was dry and the whites of his eyes showed. bigwig went out into
the field, pulled a mouthful of clover and brought it back.
     "cheer up," he said to blackavar. "have some clover."
     "that's not allowed, sir," said one of the escort.
     "oh, let him have it, bartsia," said the other. "there's no one to see. it's hard
enough for everyone on a day like this, let alone the prisoner."
     blackavar ate the clover and bigwig took up his usual place as chervil arrived
to watch the mark go out.
     the rabbits were slow and hesitant and chervil himself seemed unable to rise
to his usual brisk

replied hazel.

     "that won't do, hazel-rah," said bluebell. "he's got two does up there."
     "only hutch does," replied hazel. "i dare say they're fairly tough and fast by
now, but all the same they'll never be quite like our own kind. clover, for instance
-- she'd never go far from the hole on silflay, because she knew she couldn't run as
fast as we can. but these efrafan does, you see -- they've been kept in by sentries

those two, right away under the bank there. they feel they can -- oh, great frith!"

others? did you get any does? is everyone all right?"
     "they'll be here very soon," said hazel. "yes, we've got a lot of does and
everyone who went has come back. this is blackavar, who's come out of efrafa."
     "good for him," said strawberry. "oh, hazel-rah, we've watched at the end of
the wood every evening since you went. holly and boxwood are all right -- they're
back at the warren: and what do you think? clover's going to kindle. that's fine,
isn't it?"

can tell you. and so i will -- what a story! -- but it must wait a bit. come on -- let's
go and bring the others in."

the length of the beech hanger and reached the warren. they fed among the dew
and the long shadows, with twilight already fallen in the fields below. then they

above and under ground, the rabbits fell naturally into a quiet, undisturbed
rhythm of feeding, digging and sleeping. several fresh runs and burrows were
made. the does, who had never dug in their lives before, enjoyed the work. both
hyzenthlay and thethuthinnang told hazel that they had had no idea how much
of their frustration and unhappiness in efrafa had been due simply to not being
allowed to dig. even clover and haystack found that they could manage pretty
well and boasted that they would bear the warren's first litters in burrows that
they had dug themselves. blackavar and holly became close friends. they talked a
great deal about their different ideas of scouting and tracking, and made some
patrols together, more for their own satisfaction than because there was any real
need. one early morning they persuaded silver to come with them and traveled

ll said, any
rabbits who felt discontented could always go back to efrafa; and the thought of
all that they had faced together was enough to take the sting out of anything that
might have made a real quarrel. the contentment of the does spread to everyone
else, until one evening hazel remarked that he felt a perfect fraud as chief rabbit,
for there were no problems and hardly a dispute to be settled.
     "have you thought about the winter yet?" asked holly.
     four or five of the bucks, with clover, hyzenthlay and vilthuril, were feeding
along the sunny west side of the hanger about an hour before sunset. it was still
hot and the down was so quiet that they could hear the horses tearing the grass in
the paddock of cannon heath farm, more than half a mile away. it certainly did
not seem a time to think of winter.
     "it'll probably be colder up here than any of us have been used to," said hazel.
"but the soil's so light and the roots break it up so much that we can dig a lot

 are," said hazel. "that's what i want to find out. go at
once, holly, will you? somehow it worries me not to know."
     holly and blackavar had hardly set off when speedwell appeared above
ground. he had an excited, triumphant look which attracted everyone's attention
immediately. he squatted in front of hazel and looked round him in silence, to
make sure of his effect.
     "you've finished the hole?" asked hazel.
     "never mind the hole," answered speedwell. "i didn't come up to say that.
clover's had her litter. all good, healthy kittens. three bucks and three does, she
says."
     "you'd better go up in the beech tree and sing that," said hazel. "see that
everybody knows! but tell them not to go crowding down disturbing her."
     "i shouldn't think they would," said bigwig. "who'd be a kitten again, or even
want to see one -- blind and deaf and no fur?"
     "some of the does may want to see them," said hazel. "they're excited, you
know. but we don't want clover disturbed into eatin

have to give it up."
     "you don't know these efrafans," said blackavar. "my mother used to tell me
what happened at nutley copse. it would be better to go now."
     "well, go on, then," answered hazel. "i'm not stopping you. and i'm not
leaving this warren. it's my home." he looked at hyzenthlay, heavy with young,
who was sitting in the mouth of the nearest hole and listening to the talk. "how
far do you think she'll get? and clover -- do we leave her or what?"

     "no, we must stay," said strawberry. "i believe el-ahrairah will save us from
this woundwort; and if he doesn't, i'm not going back to efrafa, i'll tell you that."
     "fill in the holes," said hazel.
     as the sun set, the rabbits fell to clawing and scrabbling in the runs. the sides
were hard with the hot weather. it was not easy to get started, and when the soil
began to fall, it was light and powdery and did little to block the holes. it was

the place where the tree roots formed a kind of cloister in the burrow. here the
roof, latticed through and through with fine roots, was very strong. the other
seemed to be more or less above the open center of the honeycomb, but rather
nearer to the south end, where the hall broke up into bays and runs with columns
of earth between. beyond these runs lay several of the warren's burrows. one,
lined with fur torn from her own belly, contained clover and the pile of grass and
leaves, covered over with earth, in which her newborn litter were sleeping.
     "well, we seem to be putting them to a great deal of trouble," said hazel.
"that's all to the good. it'll blunt their claws and i should think they'll be tired out
before they've done. what do you make of it, blackberry?"
     "i'm afraid it's a bad lookout, hazel-rah," replied blackberry. "it's true they're
in trouble up at the top end. there's a lot of ground above us there and the roots

sorry, old chap, not another word. we need you, we need everyone. silver, see
that he goes back with the others."
     when woundwort dropped through the roof of the honeycomb, bigwig was
already lying under a thin covering of soil on the other side of the south wall, not
far from clover's burrow.

     thunder sank his teeth into a piece of broken root and pulled it out. there was
an instant fall of earth and a gap opened where he had been digging. the soil no
longer reached to the roof. it was only a broad pile of soft earth, half filling the
run. woundwort, still waiting silently, could smell and hear a considerable
number of rabbits on the far side. he hoped that now they might come into the
open burrow and try to attack him. but they made no move.

     "they're a good bunch, you know," said holly. "i hope we get some more like

     "we can't expect many more until toward the end of the winter," said hazel,
"though i dare say there'll be a few."
     "we can expect anything, it seems to me," said holly.
     "three litters born in autumn -- have you ever heard of such a thing before?
frith didn't mean rabbits to mate in the high summer."
     "i don't know about clover," said hazel. "she's a hutch rabbit: it may be
natural to her to breed at any time, for all i know. but i'm sure that hyzenthlay
and vilthuril started their litters in the high summer because they'd had no
natural life in efrafa. for all that, they're the only two who have had litters, as
yet."
     "frith never meant us to go out fighting in the high summer, either, if that
comes to that," said silver. "everything that's happened is unnatural -- the

silver. "someone not so very far away."
     they had reached the eastern end of the trees and here, well out in the open
where it was still sunny, a little group of three young rabbits -- bigger than
hyzenthlay's -- were squatting in the long grass, listening to a hulking veteran,
lop-eared and scarred from nose to haunch -- none other than bigwig, captain of
a very free-and-easy owsla. these were the bucks of clover's litter and a likely lot
they looked.
