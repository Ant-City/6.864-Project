ut there with one arm hung over the barbed wire like
a sentry who was pointing the way for someone else.
nobody paid any attention to him for several days and then both the americans and
the limeys began to notice that when the wind was right that hun was raising quite a
stink. but it was only when the wind was just so and nobody cared much until one day
when the colonel who had sent the little scotchman back of the lines came through on
inspection. the colonel was a great guy to stand on form. corporal timlon who came
from manchester always swore that in a pinch the colonel would execute nine men to
keep up the morale of the tenth. anyhow the colonel was walking along with his
moustache waxed and his bony old nose high in the wind when all of a sudden he got a
sniff of the hun.
that's a very strong odor he said to corporal timlon. he's a bavarian sir said
corporal timlon they always smell worse. the colonel coughed and blew his nose and
said very bad for the morale of the men very bad take a squad o

ut tonight and bury him
corporal. corporal timlon started to explain that things were pretty fidgity out there even
at night but the colonel interrupted him. and corporal he said stuffing his handkerchief
back into his pocket don't forgetâ€”a word of prayer. corporal timlon said yes sir and then
looked hard at his men to see who was grinning so that he could figure who to take out on
the burial squad.
so that night corporal timlon took a detail of eight men. they dug a hole and
pushed that bavarian into it and the corporal said a word of prayer like the colonel told
him and they filled the hole and came on back. the air was pretty well cleaned up next
day but the day after that heinie got a little nervous and began dropping shells all around
the limey regiment. the limeys weren't hurt any but one of the big ones happened to
catch the bavarian. he leaped into the air like in a slow motion picture and landed high
and dry o

n the wire again with his finger pointing toward the limey regiment exactly like
a stool pigeon. that was when corporal timlon started calling him lazarus.
things were pretty busy that day and all through the night. every time the limeys
had an idle half hour they would shoot at lazarus in kind of a lazy way hoping they
might knock him off the wire because they knew the nearer he was to the ground the less
he would smell and that bavarian was getting awfully gamy. but he managed to hang
onto the wire and the next morning the colonel came through again. first thing he did
was sniff the air and get a strong flavor of laz

arus. he turned to corporal timlon and
said corporal timlon when i was subaltern an order was an order and not just an
interesting suggestion. yes sir said corporal timlon. you will take a full burial squad out
tonight said the colonel and you will bury the corpse six feet deep. and just so that you
will not take orders so lightly in the future you will read the full service of the church of
england over the body of our fallen enemy. but sir said corporal timlon you see things
have been pretty heavy here and-------
that night corporal timlon took a full burial squad out. they also took a sheet to
wrap lazarus in. it wasn't very tasty work because lazarus had gotten to the runny stage
by that time but they wrapped him in the sheet and planted him six feet deep and then all
of them stood around the grave while corporal timlon read the burial service maybe
skipping over a few ands and ors but getting the general idea across pretty well.

f the service a couple flares went up from the other side and just
as the corporal was throwing the third handful of dirt into lazarus' face somebody got a
bead on him and shot him right smack through the bottom. corporal timlon hollered out
god 'ave mercy on your soul amen those bloody barstards 'ave shot me in the arse that's
wot they've done mike for cover men. and they all scrambled back to the lines.
corporal timlon got eight weeks hospital leave which was lucky for him because the
whole limey regiment was almost wiped out three weeks later. a couple days after
corporal timlon was shot lazarus stopped another one and hit the fence again with his
sheets flapping in the wind and parts of him dripping toward the ground. one of the
limeys said that was to be expected because bavarians never held up very well after the
first week. the whole regiment opened fire on poor lazarus and managed to shoot him
off the w

barbed wire. when they came on
him he was lying on his stomach in a pool of vomit. in stumbling through the barbed wire
he had fallen and struck his right arm clean up to the shoulder through lazarus.
the detail that found him brought him to the officers' dugout. he was babbling and
crying and smelling to high heaven. the captain sent him back the same night. he said it
was a penalty for befouling the officers' dugout and he got very stern when anyone
inquired what had happened to the kid. when corporal timlon came back with his seat
repaired and someone told him the story he asked well how is the kid getting along? a
little guy named johnston who kept the whole regiment posted on such things said oh hell
he's mad as a hatter they haven't even let him out of the straight-jacket yet. well said
corporal timlon when is he going to get better? the doctors say he ain't never going to
get better said johnston he's bad off that one.
