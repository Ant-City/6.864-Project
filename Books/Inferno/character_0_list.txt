Dante - 
                The
author and protagonist of Inferno; the focus of
all action and interaction with other characters. Because Dante
chose to present his fictional poem as a record of events that actually
happened to him, a wide gulf between Dante the poet and Dante the
character pervades the poem. For instance, Dante the poet often portrays
Dante the character as compassionate and sympathetic at the sight
of suffering sinners, but Dante the poet chose to place them in
Hell and devised their suffering. As a result, if Dante the character
is at all representative of Dante the poet, he is a very simplified version:
sympathetic, somewhat fearful of danger, and confused both morally
and intellectually by his experience in Hell. As the poem progresses,
Dante the character gradually learns to abandon his sympathy and
adopt a more pitiless attitude toward the punishment of sinners,
which he views as merely a reflection of divine justice.
