Oberon - 
                The
king of the fairies, Oberon is initially at odds with his wife,
Titania, because she refuses to relinquish control of a young Indian
prince whom he wants for a knight. Oberon's desire for revenge on
Titania leads him to send Puck to obtain the love-potion flower
that creates so much of the play's confusion and farce.
