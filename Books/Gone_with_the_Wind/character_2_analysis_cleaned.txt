[CHARACTER]
blond, dreamy, and honorable, [CHARACTER] is the foil
to rhett's dark, realistic opportunism. ashley courts scarlett but
marries melanie hamilton, thus setting in motion scarlett's central
conflict. ashley is the perfect prewar southern gentleman: he excels
at hunting and riding, takes pleasure in the arts, and comes from
an excellent family.
	scarlett's idealization of ashley slowly fades as time
goes on, and she finally sees that the ashley she loves is not a
real man but a man embellished and adorned by her imagination. ashley
admits to his love for scarlett, but as a gentleman he ignores this
love in order to marry melanie, the more socially appropriate match
for him. he excels at battle despite his doubts about the southern
cause. as the novel progresses, though, ashley displays signs of
weakness and incompetence. after the war he is worthless on the
plantation and cannot adjust to the new world. whereas rhett and
scarlett survive by sacrificing their commitment to tradition, ashley
cannot or will not allow himself to thrive in a changed society.
he sinks even lower as he sacrifices his honor--the only thing he
still values in himself--by accepting charity from scarlett in the
form of a share in her mill and by kissing her twice. 
	ashley represents the old south and southern nostalgia
for the prewar days. he epitomizes the old lifestyle and cannot
function in the new south that emerges during and after the war.
scarlett clings to him like many southerners cling to dreams of
their old lives, but her eventual recognition of ashley's weakness
and incompetence enables her to see that dreaming of a lost world
makes one weak.
