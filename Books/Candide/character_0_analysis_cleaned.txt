[CHARACTER] 
[CHARACTER] is the protagonist of the novel, but
he is bland, naive, and highly susceptible to the influence of stronger
characters. like the other characters, [CHARACTER] is less a realistic
individual  than the embodiment of a particular idea or folly that
voltaire wishes to illustrate.

[CHARACTER]'s name is derived from the latin word candidus, which means
"white" and connotes fair-mindedness or a lack of corruption. as
that name suggests, [CHARACTER] begins the novel as a perfect innocent--wide-eyed
in his worship of his tutor pangloss's wrongheaded optimistic philosophy,
and completely unfamiliar with the ways of the world. over the course
of the novel, [CHARACTER] acquires wealth and even some knowledge about
the world, and begins to question his faith in optimism. yet that
faith remains and is frequently reactivated by any event that pleases
him, from the kindness of the stranger jacques to the death of vanderdendur,
the merchant who cheats him. at the end of the novel, [CHARACTER] rejects
pangloss's philosophizing in favor of the practical labor that is
introduced to him by the old farmer. while this shift in philosophy
appears on the surface to be real progress, [CHARACTER]'s personality
remains essentially unchanged. he is still incapable of forming
his own opinions, and has simply exchanged blind faith in pangloss's
opinions for blind faith in the opinions of the farmer. despite
his simplicity, [CHARACTER] is an effective, sympathetic hero. he is
fundamentally honest and good-hearted. he readily gives money to
strangers like brother giroflee and the poorest deposed king, and
he honors his commitment to marry cunegonde even after his love
for her has faded. his naivete, though incredible, makes [CHARACTER]
sympathetic to readers; the world of the novel is exaggerated and
fantastic, and we are likely to find the events described as unsettling
and confusing as he does.
