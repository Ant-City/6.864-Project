Feste - 
                	The
clown, or fool, of Olivia's household, Feste moves between Olivia's
and Orsino's homes. He earns his living by making pointed jokes,
singing old songs, being generally witty, and offering good advice
cloaked under a layer of foolishness. In spite of being a professional
fool, Feste often seems the wisest character in the play.
