during an interval in the melvinski trial in the large building of the law courts the 
members and public prosecutor met in ivan egorovich shebek's private room, 
where the conversation turned on the celebrated krasovski case. fedor 
vasilievich warmly maintained that it was not subject to their jurisdiction, ivan 
egorovich maintained the contrary, while peter ivanovich, not having entered into 
the discussion at the start, took no part in it but looked through the gazette, 
which had just been handed in. 
 
"gentlemen," he said, "ivan ilyich has died!"  
 
"you don't say so!" 
 
"here, read it yourself," replied peter ivanovich, handing fedor vasilievich the 
paper still damp from the press. surrounded by a black border were the words: 
"praskovya fedorovna golovina, with profound sorrow, informs relatives and 
friends of the demise of her beloved husband iva

s or their acquaintances.  
 

"i shall be sure to get shtabel's place or vinnikov's," thought fedor vasilievich. "i 
was promised that long ago, and the promotion means an extra eight hundred 
rubles a year for me besides the allowance."  
 
"now i must apply for my brother-in-law's transfer from kaluga," thought peter 
ivanovich. "my wife will be very glad, and then she won't be able to say that i 
never do anything for her relations."  
 
"i thought he would never leave his bed again," said peter ivanovich aloud. "it's 
very sad."  
 
"but what really was the matter with him?"  
 
"the doctors couldn't say -- at least they could, but each of them said something 
different. when last i saw him i though he was getting better."  
 
"and i haven't been to see him since the holidays. i always meant to go."  
 
"had he any property?"  
 
"i think his wife had a little -- but something quite trifling."  
 
"we shall have to go to see her, but they live so terribly far away."  
 
"far away from you, you

act of the death of a near acquaintance 
aroused, as usual, in all who heard of it the complacent feeling that, "it is he who 
is dead and not i."  
 
each one thought or felt, "well, he's dead but i'm alive!" but the more intimate of 
ivan ilyich's acquaintances, his so-called friends, could not help thinking also that 
they would now have to fulfill the very tiresome demands of propriety by 
attending the funeral service and paying a visit of condolence to the widow.  
 
fedor vasilievich and peter ivanovich had been his nearest acquaintances. 
peter ivanovich had studied law with ivan ilyich and had considered himself to be 
under obligations to him.  
 
having told his wife at dinnertime of ivan ilyich's death, and of his conjecture that 
it might be possible to get her brother transferred to their circuit, peter ivanovich 

sacrificed his usual nap, put on his evening clothes and drove to ivan ilych's 
house.  
 
at the entrance stood a carriage and two cabs. leaning against the wall in the

ll downstairs near the cloak stand was a coffin-lid covered with cloth of gold, 
ornamented with gold cord and tassels, which had been polished up with metal 
powder. two ladies in black were taking off their fur cloaks. peter ivanovich 
recognized one of them as ivan ilych's sister, but the other was a stranger to him. 
his colleague schwartz was just coming downstairs, but on seeing peter 
ivanovich enter he stopped and winked at him, as if to say: "ivan ilyich has made 
a mess of things -- not like you and me."  
 
schwartz's face with his piccadilly whiskers, and his slim figure in evening dress, 
had as usual an air of elegant solemnity which contrasted with the playfulness of 
his character and had a special piquancy her

e, or so it seemed to peter 
ivanovich.  
 
peter ivanovich allowed the ladies to precede him and slowly followed them 
upstairs. schwartz did not come down but remained where he was, and peter 
ivanovich understood that he wanted to arrange where they should play bridge 
that evening. the ladies went upstairs to the widow's room, and schwartz with 
seriously compressed lips but a playful looking his eyes, indicated by a twist of 
his eyebrows the room to the right where the body lay.  
 
peter ivanovich, like everyone else on such occasions, entered feeling uncertain 
what he would have to do. all he knew was that at such times it is always safe to 
cross oneself. but he was not quite sure whether one should make obeisance 
while doing so. he therefore adopted a middle course. on entering the room he 
began crossing himself and made a slight movement resembling a bow. at the 
same time, as far as the motion of his head and arm allowed, he surveyed the 
room. two young men -- apparently nephews

, one of whom was a high-school 
pupil -- were leaving the room, crossing themselves as they did so. an old 
woman was standing motionless, and a lady with strangely arched eyebrows was 
saying something to her in a whisper. a vigorous, resolute church reader, in a 
frock- coat, was reading something in a loud voice with an expression that 
precluded any contradiction. the butler's assistant, gerasim, stepping lightly in 
front of peter ivanovich, was strewing something on the floor. noticing this, peter 
ivanovich was immediately aware of a faint odor of a decomposing body.  
 
the last time he had called on ivan ilyich, peter ivanovich had seen gerasim in 
the study. ivan ilyich had been particularly fond of him and he was performing the 
duty of a sick nurse.  
 
peter ivanovich continued to make the sign of the cross slightly inclining his head 
in an intermediate direction between the coffin, the reader, and the icons on the 
table

 way peculiar to the dead, the protruding nose seeming to press 
on the upper lip. he was much changed and grown even thinner since peter 
ivanovich had last seen him, but, as is always the case with the dead, his face 
was handsomer and above all more dignified than when he was alive. the 
expression on the face said that what was necessary had been accomplished, 
and accomplished rightly. besides this there was in that expression a 
reproach and a warning to the living. this warning seemed to peter ivanovich 
out of place, or at least not applicable to him. he felt a certain discomfort and so 
he hurriedly crossed himself once more and turned and went out of the door -- 
too hurriedly and too regardless of propriety, as he himself was aware.  
 
schwartz was waiting for him in the adjoining room with legs spread wide apart 
and both hands toying with his top hat behind his back. the mere sight of that 
playful, well-groomed, and elegant figure refreshed peter ivanovich. he felt that 
schwartz was a

ressing influences. his very look said that this incident of a church service for 
ivan ilyich could not be a sufficient reason for infringing the order of the session -
- in other words, that it would certainly not prevent his unwrapping a new pack of 
cards and shuffling them that evening while a footman placed fresh candles on 
the table: in fact, that there was no reason for supposing that this incident would 
hinder their spending the evening agreeably. indeed he said this in a whisper as 
peter ivanovich passed him, proposing that they should meet for a game at 
fedor vasilievich's. but apparently peter ivanovich was not destined to play 
bridge that evening. praskovya fedorovna (a short, fat woman who despite all 
efforts to the contrary had continued to broaden steadily from her shoulders 
downwards and who had the same extraordinarily arched eyebrows as the lady 
who had been standing by the coffin), dressed all in black, her head covered with 
lace, came out of her own room with some other

ladies, conducted them to the 
room where the dead body lay, and said: "the service will begin immediately. 
please go in."  
 
schwartz, making an indefinite bow, stood still, evidently neither accepting nor 
declining this invitation. praskovya fedorovna recognizing peter ivanovich, 
sighed, went close up to him, took his hand, and said: "i know you were a true 
friend to ivan ilyich..." and looked at him awaiting some suitable response. and 
peter ivanovich knew that, just as it had been the right thing to cross himself in 
that room, so what he had to do here was to press her hand, sigh, and say, 
"believe me..." so he did all this and as he did it felt that the desired result had 
been achieved: that both he and she were touched.  
 

"come with me. i want to speak to you before it begins," said the widow. "give 
me your arm."  
 
peter ivanovich gave her his arm and they went to the inner rooms, passing 
schwartz who winked at peter ivanovich

compassionately.  
 
"that does for our bridge! don's object if we find another player. perhaps you 
can cut in when you do escape," said his playful look.  
 
peter ivanovich sighed still more deeply and despondently, and praskovya 
fedorovna pressed his arm gratefully. when they reached the drawing room, 
upholstered in pink cretonne and lighted by a dim lamp, they sat down at the 
table -- she on a sofa and peter ivanovich on a low pouf, the springs of which 
yielded spasmodically under his weight. praskovya fedorovna had been on the 
point of warning him to take another seat, but felt that such a warning was out of 
keeping with her present condition and so changed her mind. as he sat down on 
the pouf peter ivanovich recalled how ivan ilyich had arranged this room and had 
consulted him regarding this pink cretonne with green leaves. the whole room 
was full of furniture and knick-knacks, and on her way to the

sofa the lace of the 
widow's black shawl caught on the edge of the table. peter ivanovich rose to 
detach it, and the springs of the pouf, relieved of his weight, rose also and gave 
him a push. the widow began detaching her shawl herself, and peter ivanovich 
again sat down, suppressing the rebellious springs of the pouf under him. but the 
widow had not quite freed herself and peter ivanovich got up again, and again 
the pouf rebelled and even creaked. when this was all over she took out a clean 
cambric handkerchief and began to weep. the episode with the shawl and the 
struggle with the pouf had cooled peter ivanovich's emotions and he sat there 
with a sullen look on his face. this awkward situation was interrupted by sokolov, 
ivan ilych's butler, who came to report that the plot in the cemetery that 
praskovya fedorovna had chosen would cost two hundred rubles. she stopped

ping and, looking at peter ivanovich with the air of a victim, remarked in 
french that it was very hard for her. peter ivanovich made a silent gesture 
signifying his full conviction that it must indeed be so.  
 
"please smoke," she said in a magnanimous yet crushed voice, and turned to 
discuss with sokolov the price of the plot for the grave.  
 
peter ivanovich while lighting his cigarette heard her inquiring very 
circumstantially into the prices of different plots in the cemetery and finally decide 
which she would take. when that was done she gave instructions about 
engaging the choir. sokolov then left the room.  
 
"i look after everything myself," she told peter ivanovich, shifting the albums that 
lay on the table; and noticing that the table was endangered by his cigarette-ash, 
she immediately passed him an ash-tray, saying as she did so: "i

 consider it an 
affectation to say that my grief prevents my attending to practical affairs. on the 

contrary, if anything can -- i won't say console me, but -- distract me, it is seeing 
to everything concerning him." she again took out her handkerchief as if 
preparing to cry, but suddenly, as if mastering her feeling, she shook herself and 
began to speak calmly. "but there is something i want to talk to you about."  
 
peter ivanovich bowed, keeping control of the springs of the pouf, which 
immediately began quivering under him.  
 
"he suffered terribly the last few days."  
 
"did he?" said peter ivanovich.  
 
"oh, terribly! he screamed unceasingly, not for minutes but for hours. for 
the last three days he screamed incessantly. it was unendurable. i cannot 
understand how i bore it; you could hear him three rooms off. oh, what i 
have suffered!"  
 
"is it possible that he was conscious all that time?" asked peter ivano

vich.  
 
"yes," she whispered. "to the last moment. he took leave of us a quarter of an 
hour before he died, and asked us to take volodya away."  
 
the thought of the suffering of this man he had known so intimately, first as a 
merry little boy, then as a schoolmate, and later as a grown-up colleague, 
suddenly struck peter ivanovich with horror, despite an unpleasant 
consciousness of his own and this woman's dissimulation. he again saw that 
brow, and that nose pressing down on the lip, and felt afraid for himself.  
 
"three days of frightful suffering and the death! why, that might suddenly, at any 
time, happen to me," he thought, and for a moment felt terrified. but -- he did 
not himself know how -- the customary reflection at once occurred to him 
that this had happened to ivan ilyich and not to him, and that it sho

uld not 
and could not happen to him, and that to think that it could would be 
yielding to depressing which he ought not to do, as schwartz's expression 
plainly showed. after which reflection peter ivanovich felt reassured, and 
began to ask with interest about the details of ivan ilych's death, as though 
death was an accident natural to ivan ilyich but certainly not to himself.  
 
after many details of the really dreadful physical sufferings ivan ilyich had 
endured (which details he learnt only from the effect those sufferings had 
produced on praskovya fedorovna's nerves) the widow apparently found it 
necessary to get to business.  
 
"oh, peter ivanovich, how hard it is! how terribly, terrib

ly hard!" and she again 
began to weep.  
 

peter ivanovich sighed and waited for her to finish blowing her nose. when she 
had don so he said, "believe me..." and she again began talking and brought out 
what was evidently her chief concern with him -- namely, to question him as to 
how she could obtain a grant of money from the government on the occasion of 
her husband's death. she made it appear that she was asking peter ivanovich's 
advice about her pension, but he soon saw that she already knew about that to 
the minutest detail, more even than he did himself. she knew how much could be 
got out of the government in consequence of her husband's death, but wanted to 
find out whether she could not possibly extract something more. peter ivanovich 
tried to think of some means of doing so, but after reflecting for a while and, out 
of propriety, condemning the government for its niggardliness, he said he thought 
that not

hing more could be got. then she sighed and evidently began to devise 
means of getting rid of her visitor. noticing this, he put out his cigarette, rose, 
pressed her hand, and went out into the anteroom.  
 
in the dining room where the clock stood that ivan ilyich had liked so much and 
had bought at an antique shop, peter ivanovich met a priest and a few 
acquaintances who had come to attend the service, and he recognized ivan 
ilych's daughter, a handsome young woman. she was in black and her slim 
figure appeared slimmer than ever. she had a gloomy, determined, almost angry 
expression, and bowed to peter ivanovich as though he were in some way to 
blame. behind her, with the same offended look, stood a wealthy young man, 
and examining magistrate, whom peter ivanovich also knew and who was her 
fiancé, as he had heard

. he bowed mournfully to them and was about to pass 
into the death-chamber, when from under the stairs appeared the figure of ivan 
ilych's schoolboy son, who was extremely like his father. he seemed a little ivan 
ilyich, such as peter ivanovich remembered when they studied law together. his 
tear-stained eyes had in them the look that is seen in the eyes of boys of thirteen 
or fourteen who are not pure-minded.  
 
when he saw peter ivanovich he scowled morosely and shamefacedly. peter 
ivanovich nodded to him and entered the death-chamber. the service began: 
candles, groans, incense, tears, and sobs. peter ivanovich stood looking 
gloomily down at his feet. he did not look once at the dead man, did not yield to 
any depressing influence, and was one of the first to leave the room. there was 
no one in the anteroom, but gerasim darted out of the dead man's room, 
rummaged with his strong hands among the fur coats to find peter ivan

and helped him on with it.  
 
"well, friend gerasim," said peter ivanovich, so as to say something. "it's a sad 
affair, isn't it?"  
 
"it's god will. we shall all come to it some day," said gerasim, displaying 
his teeth -- the even white teeth of a healthy peasant -- and, like a man in 
the thick of urgent work, he briskly opened the front door, called the 

coachman, helped peter ivanovich into the sledge, and sprang back to the 
porch as if in readiness for what he had to do next.  
 
peter ivanovich found the fresh air particularly pleasant after the smell of 
incense, the dead body, and carbolic acid.  
 
"where to sir?" asked the coachman.  
 
"it's not too late even now.... i’ll call round on fedor vasilievich."   
 
he accordingly drove there and found them just finishing the first rubber, so that 
it was quite convenient for him to cut in.

it had to carry with it a salary of five thousand rubles and be in a ministry other 
than that in which they had failed to appreciate him.  
 
and this quest of ivan ilyich's was crowned with remarkable and unexpected 
success. at kursk an acquaintance of his, f. i. ilyin, got into the first-class 
carriage, sat down beside ivan ilyich, and told him of a telegram just received by 
the governor of kursk announcing that a change was about to take place in the 
ministry: peter ivanovich was to be superseded by ivan semonovich.  
 
the proposed change, apart from its significance for russia, had a special 
significance for ivan ilyich, because by bringing forward a new man, peter 
petrovich, and consequently his friend zachar ivanovich, it was highly favorable 
for ivan ilyich, since sachar ivanovich was a friend and colleague of his.  
 
in moscow this news was confirmed, and on reaching petersburg ivan ilyich 
found zachar ivanovich and received a definite promise of an appoi

did. her attitude was this: "you know," she would say to her friends, 
"ivan ilyich can't do as other people do, and keep to the treatment prescribed for 
him. one day he'll take his drops and keep strictly to his diet and go to bed in 
good time, but the next day unless i watch him he'll suddenly forget his medicine, 
eat sturgeon -- which is forbidden -- and sit up playing cards till one o'clock in the 
morning."  
 
"oh, come, when was that?" ivan ilyich would ask in vexation. "only once at 
peter ivanovich's."  
 
"and yesterday with shebek."  
 
"well, even if i hadn't stayed up, this pain would have kept me awake."  
 
"be that as it may you'll never get well like that, but will always make us 
wretched."  
 
praskovya fedorovna's attitude to ivan ilyich's illness, as she expressed it both 
to others and to him, was that it was his own fault and was another of the 

annoyances he caused her. ivan ilyich felt that this opinion escaped her 
involuntarily -- but that did not make it easier for hi

contrary..."  
 
ivan ilyich walked away, went to his own room, lay down, and began musing; 
"the kidney, a floating kidney." he recalled all the doctors had told him of how it 
detached itself and swayed about. and by an effort of imagination he tried to 
catch that kidney and arrest it and support it. so little was needed for this, it 
seemed to him. "no, i'll go to see peter ivanovich again." [that was the friend 
whose friend was a doctor.] he rang, ordered the carriage, and got ready to go.  

 
"where are you going, jean?" asked his wife with an especially sad and 
exceptionally kind look.  
 
this exceptionally kind look irritated him. he looked morosely at her.

he went to see peter ivanovich, and together they went to see his friend, the
