impassive, with lips that parted and said dryly:

"oh!  well, i took you for ruth wilcox."

margaret stammered: "i--mrs. wilcox--i?"

"in fancy, of course--in fancy.  you had her way of
walking.  good-day." and the old woman passed out into the
rain.

"it gave her quite a turn," said mr. wilcox, when retailing
the incident to dolly at tea-time.  "none of you girls have
any nerves, really.  of course, a word from me put it all
right, but silly old miss avery--she frightened you, didn't
she, margaret?  there you stood clutching a bunch of weeds.
she might have said something, instead of coming down the
stairs with that alarming bonnet on.  i passed her as i came
in.  enough to make the car shy.  i believe miss avery goes
in for being a character; some old maids do." he lit a
cigarette.  "it is their last resource.  heaven knows what
she was doing in the place; but that's bryce's business, not
mine."

"i wasn't as foolish as you suggest," said margar

"she only startled me, for the house had been silent so long."

"did you take her for a spook?" asked dolly, for whom
"spooks" and "going to church" summarized the unseen.

"not exactly."

"she really did frighten you," said henry, who was far
from discouraging timidity in females.  "poor margaret!  and
very naturally.  uneducated classes are so stupid."

"is miss avery uneducated classes?" margaret asked, and
found herself looking at the decoration scheme of dolly's
drawing-room.

"she's just one of the crew at the farm.  people like
that always assume things.  she assumed you'd know who she
was.  she left all the howards end keys in the front lobby,
and assumed that you'd seen them as you came in, that you'd
lock up the house when you'd done, and would bring them on
down to her.  and there was her niece hunting for them down
at the farm.  lack of education m

which was illogical but interesting.  through dolly,
margaret was destined to learn a good deal.

"but charles said i must try not to mind, because she
had known his grandmother."

"as usual, you've got the story wrong, my good dorothea."

"i mean great-grandmother--the one who left mrs. wilcox
the house.  weren't both of them and miss avery friends when

dolly was--for the following reason.

"then hadn't mrs. wilcox a brother--or was it an uncle?
anyhow, he popped the question, and miss avery, she said
'no.' just imagine, if she'd said 'yes,' she would have been
charles's aunt. (oh, i say,--that's rather good!  'charlie's
aunt'!  i must chaff him about that this evening.) and the
man went out and was killed.  yes, i'm certain i've got it
right now.  tom howard--he was the last of them."

"i believe so," said mr. wilcox negligently.

"i say!  howards end--howard's ended!" cried dolly.
"i'm rather on the spot this evening, eh?"

"i wish you'd ask whether crane's ended."

and, starting from howards end, she attempted to realize
england.  she failed--visions do not come when we try,
though they may come through trying.  but an unexpected love
of the island awoke in her, connecting on this side with the
joys of the flesh, on that with the inconceivable.  helen
and her father had known this love, poor leonard bast was
groping after it, but it had been hidden from margaret till
this afternoon.  it had certainly come through the house and
old miss avery.  through them: the notion of "through"
persisted; her mind trembled towards a conclusion which only
the unwise have put into words.  then, veering back into
warmth, it dwelt on ruddy bricks, flowering plum-trees, and
all the tangible joys of, spring.

henry, after allaying her agitation, had taken her over
his property, and had explained to her the use and
dimensions of the various rooms.  he had sketched the
history of the little estate.  "it is so unlucky," ran the
monologue, "that money was

him for the deed.  "when i had more control i did what i

that the rent would be paid regularly, he cancelled the
agreement, and resumed possession himself.  until he relet
the house, the schlegels were welcome to stack their
furniture in the garage and lower rooms.  margaret demurred,
but tibby accepted the offer gladly; it saved him from
coming to any decision about the future.  the plate and the
more valuable pictures found a safer home in london, but the
bulk of the things went country-ways, and were entrusted to
the guardianship of miss avery.

shortly before the move, our hero and heroine were
married.  they have weathered the storm, and may reasonably
expect peace.  to have no illusions and yet to love--what
stronger surety can a woman find?  she had seen her
husband's past as well as his heart.  she knew her own heart
with a thoroughness that commonplace people believe
impossible.  the heart of mrs. wilcox was alone hidden, and
perhaps it is superstitious to speculate on the feelings of
the dead.  they were married quietly--reall

ought up his children with expensive tastes,
believed in letting them shift for themselves.  after all,
he had not treated them generously.  yet another baby was
expected, she told margaret, and they would have to give up
the motor.  margaret sympathized, but in a formal fashion,
and dolly little imagined that the step-mother was urging
mr. wilcox to make them a more liberal allowance.  she
sighed again, and at last the particular grievance was
remembered.  "oh yes," she cried, "that is it: miss avery
has been unpacking your packing-cases."

"why has she done that?  how unnecessary!"

"ask another.  i suppose you ordered her to."

"i gave no such orders.  perhaps she was airing the
things.  she did undertake to light an occasional fire."

"it was far more than an air," said dolly solemnly.
"the floor sounds covered with books.  charles sent me to
know what is to be done, for he feels certain you don't know."

"books!" cried margaret, moved by the holy word.
"dolly, are you serious?  has she

been touching our books?"

"hasn't she, though!  what used to be the hall's full of
them.  charles thought for certain you knew of it."

"i am very much obliged to you, dolly.  what can have
come over miss avery?  i must go down about it at once.
some of the books are my brother's, and are quite valuable.
she had no right to open any of the cases."

"i say she's dotty.  she was the one that never got
married, you know.  oh, i say, perhaps she thinks your books
are wedding-presents to herself.  old maids are taken that
way sometimes.  miss avery hates us all like poison ever
since her frightful dust-up with evie."

"i hadn't heard of that," said margaret.  a visit from
dolly had its compensations.

"did

her to do such a heartless thing."

"but the present was so expensive."

"why does that make any difference, dolly?"

"still, when it costs over five pounds--i didn't see it,
but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a bond street shop.

uncle percy and albert and father and charles all said it
was quite impossible, and when four men agree, what is a
girl to do?  evie didn't want to upset the old thing, so
thought a sort of joking letter best, and returned the
pendant straight to the shop to save miss avery trouble."

"but miss avery said--"

dolly's eyes grew round.  "it was a perfectly awful
letter.  charles said it was the letter of a madman.  in the
end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw
it into the duckpond.

"did she give any reasons?"

"we think she meant to be invited to oniton, and so
climb into society."

"she's rather old for that," said margaret pensively.
"may not she have given the present to evie in remembrance
of her mother?"

"that's a notion.  give every one their due, eh?  well,

ose i ought to be toddling.  come along, mr. muff--you
want a new coat, but i don't know who'll give it you, i'm
sure;" and addressing her apparel with mournful humour,
dolly moved from the room.

margaret followed her to ask whether henry knew about
miss avery's rudeness.

"oh yes."

"i wonder, then, why he let me ask her to look after the
house."

"but she's only a farm woman," said dolly, and her
explanation proved correct.  henry only censured the lower
classes when it suited him.  he bore with miss avery as with
crane--because he could get good value out of them.  "i have
patience with a man who knows his job," he would say, really
having patience with the job, and not the man.  paradoxical
as it may sound, he had something of the artist about hi

margaret judged it better to settle the little trouble
herself.  parties were evidently ruffled.  with henry's
permission, she wrote a pleasant note to miss avery, asking
her to leave the cases untouched.  then, at the first
convenient opportunity, she went down herself, intending to
repack her belongings and store them properly in the local
warehouse: the plan had been amateurish and a failure.
tibby promised to accompany her, but at the last moment
begged to be excused.  so, for the second time in her life,
she entered the house alone.

her anxiety about helen's extraordinary absence was still
dormant, and as for a possible brush with miss avery--that
only gave zest to the expedition.  she had also eluded
dolly's invitation to luncheon.  walking straight up from
the station, she crossed the village green and entered the
long chestnut avenue that connects it with the church.  the
church itself stood in the village once.  but it there
attracted so many worshippers that the devil, in a pet,
snatched it from its foundations, and poised it on an
inconvenient knoll, three-quarters of a mile away.  if this
story is true, the chestnut avenue m

not if i cut it for you?"

margaret refused the cake, but unfortunately this
acquired her gentility in the eyes of miss avery's niece.

mustn't.  i will direct you myself if it comes to that.  i

stunned, margaret did not move from the best parlour,
over which the touch of art nouveau had fallen.  but the
other rooms looked in keeping, though they conveyed the
peculiar sadness of a rural interior.  here had lived an
elder race, to which we look back with disquietude.  the

sang his two syllables on the
budding guelder-rose.  some children were playing
uproariously in heaps of golden straw.  it was the presence
of sadness at all that surprised margaret, and ended by
giving her a feeling of completeness.  in these english
farms, if anywhere, one might see life steadily and see it
whole, group in one vision its transitoriness and its
eternal youth, connect--connect without bitterness until all
men are brothers.  but her thoughts were interrupted by the
return of miss avery's niece, and were so tranquillizing
that she suffered the interruption gladly.

it was quicker to go out by the back door, and, after
due explanations, they went out by it.  the niece was now
mortified by unnumerable chickens, who rushed up to her feet
for food, and by a shameless and maternal sow.  she did not
know what animals were coming to.  but her gentility
withered at the touch of the sweet air.  the wind was

through the myrtles of tuscany with the graces before her
and the zephyr behind.

the two women walked up the lane full of outward
civility.  but margaret was thinking how difficult it was to
be earnest about furniture on such a day, and the niece was
thinking about hats.  thus engaged, they reached howards
end.  petulant cries of "auntie!" severed the air.  there
was no reply, and the front door was locked.

"are you sure that miss avery is up here?" asked margaret.

"oh yes, mrs. wilcox, quite sure.  she is here daily."

margaret tried to look in through the dining-room
window, but the curtain inside was drawn tightly.  so with
the drawing-room and the hall.  the appearance of these
curtains was familiar, yet she did not remember them being
there on her other visit: her impression was that mr. bryce
had taken everything away.  they tried the back.  here again
they received no answer, and could see nothing; the

as fitted with a blind, while the pantry and
scullery had pieces of wood propped up against them, which
looked ominously like the lids of packing-cases.  margaret
thought of her books, and she lifted up her voice also.  at
the first cry she succeeded.

"well, well!" replied someone inside the house.  "if it
isn't mrs. wilcox come at last!"

"have you got the key, auntie?"

"madge, go away," said miss avery, still invisible.

"auntie, it's mrs. wilcox--"

margaret supported her.  "your niece and i have come together--"

"madge, go away.  this is no moment for your hat."

the poor woman went red.  "auntie gets more eccentric
lately," she said nervously.

"miss avery!" called margaret.  "i have come about the
furniture.  could you kindly let me in?"

"yes, mrs. wilcox," said the voice, "of course." but
after that came silence.  they called again without
response.  they walked round the house discons

olately.

"i hope miss avery is not ill," hazarded margaret.

"well, if you'll excuse me," said madge, "perhaps i
ought to be leaving you now.  the servants need seeing to at
the farm.  auntie is so odd at times." gathering up her
elegancies, she retired defeated, and, as if her departure
had loosed a spring, the front door opened at once.

miss avery said, "well, come right in, mrs. wilcox!"
quite pleasantly and calmly.

"thank you so much," began margaret, but broke off at
the sight of an umbrella-stand.  it was her own.

"come right into the hall first," said miss avery.  she
drew the curtain, and margaret uttered a cry of despair.
for an appalling thing had happened.  the hall was fitted up
with the contents of the library from wickham place.  the
carpet had been laid, the big work-table drawn up near the
window; the bookcases filled the
 
 ___________________________
 
 wall opposite the
fireplace, and her father's sword--this is what bewildered
her particularly--had been drawn from its scabbard and hung
naked amongst the sober volumes.  miss avery must have
worked for days.

"i'm afraid this isn't what we meant," she began.  "mr.
wilcox and i never intended the cases to be touched.  for
instance, these books are my brother's.  we are storing them
for him and for my sister, who is abroad.  when you kindly
undertook to look after things, we never expected you to do
so much."

"the house has been empty long enough," said the old woman.

margaret refused to argue.  "i dare say we didn't
explain," she said civilly.  "it has been a mistake, an

very likely our mistake."

"mrs. wilcox, it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty
years.  the house is mrs. wilcox's, and she would not desire
it to stand empty any longer."

to help the poor decaying brain, margaret said:

"yes, mrs. wilcox's house, the mother of mr. charles."

"mistake upon mistake," said miss avery.  "mistake upon mistake."

"well, i don't know," said margaret, sitting down in one
of her own chairs.  "i really don't know what's to be
done."  she could not help laughing.

the other said: "yes, it should be a merry house enough."

"i don't know--i dare say.  well, thank you very much,
miss avery.  yes, that's all right.  delightful."

"there is still the parlour." she went through the door
opposite and drew a curtain.  light flooded the drawing-room
and the drawing-room furniture from wickh

dining-room."  more curtains were drawn, more windows were
flung open to the spring.  "then through here--" miss avery
continued passing and repassing through the hall.  her voice
was lost, but margaret heard her pulling up the kitchen
blind.  "i've not finished here yet," she announced,
returning.  "there's still a deal to do.  the farm lads will
carry your great wardrobes upstairs, for there is no need to
go into expense at hilton."

"it is all a mistake," repeated margaret, feeling that
she must put her foot down.  "a misunderstanding.  mr.
wilcox and i are not going to live at howards end."

"oh, indeed.  o

n account of his hay fever?"

"we have settled to build a new home for ourselves in
sussex, and part of this furniture--my part--will go down
there presently." she looked at miss avery intently, trying
to understand the kink in her brain.  here was no maundering
old woman.  her wrinkles were shrewd and humorous.  she
looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but
unostentatious nobility.

"you think that you won't come back to live here, mrs.
wilcox, but you will."

"that remains to be seen," said margaret, smiling.  "we
have no intention of doing so for the present.  we happen to
need a much larger house.  circumstances oblige us to give
big parties.  of course, some da

miss avery retorted: "some day!  tcha!  tcha!  don't
talk about some day.  you are living here now."

"am i?"

"you are living here, and have been for the last ten
minutes, if you ask me."

it was a senseless remark, but with a queer feeling of
disloyalty margaret rose from her chair.  she felt that
henry had been obscurely censured.  they went into the
dining-room, where the sunlight poured in upon her mother's
chiffonier, and upstairs, where many an old god peeped from
a new niche.  the furniture fitted

 extraordinarily well.  in
the central room--over the hall, the room that helen had
slept in four years ago--miss avery had placed tibby's old
bassinette.

"the nursery," she said.

margaret turned away without speaking.

at last everything was seen.  the kitchen and lobby were
still stacked with furniture and straw, but, as far as she
could make out, nothing had been broken or scratched.  a
pathetic display of ingenuity!  then they took a friendly
stroll in the garden.  it had gone wild since her last
visit.  the gravel sweep was weedy, and grass had sprung up
at the very jaws of the garage.  and evie's rockery
 
 ___________________________
 
 was only
bumps.  perhaps evie was responsible for miss avery's
oddness.  but margaret suspected that the cause lay deeper,
and that the girl's silly letter had but loosed the
irritation of years.

"it's a beautiful meadow," she remarked.  it was one of
those open-air drawing-rooms that have been formed, hundreds
of years ago, out of the smaller fields.  so the boundary
hedge zigzagged down the hill at right angles, and at the
bottom there was a little green annex--a sort of
powder-closet for the cows.

"yes, the maidy's well enough," said miss avery, "fo

things.  there's not one wilcox that can stand up against a
field in june--i laughed fit to burst while he was courting ruth."

"my brother gets hay fever too," said margaret.

"this house lies too much on the land for them.
naturally, they were glad enough to slip in at first.  but
wilcoxes are better than nothing, as i see you've found."

margaret laughed.

"they keep a place going, don't they?  yes, it is just that."

"they keep england going, it is my opinion."

but miss avery upset her by replying: "ay, they breed
like rabbits.  well, well, it's a funny world.  but he who
made it knows what he wants in it, i suppose.  if mrs.
charlie is expecting her fourth, it isn't for us to repine."

"they breed and they also work," said margaret,
conscious of some invitation to disloyalty, which was echoed
by the very breeze and by the songs of the birds.  "it
certainly is a funny world, but so long as men like my
husband and his sons govern it, i think it'll never be a bad
one-
 
 ___________________________
 
-never really bad."

"no, better'n nothing," said miss avery, and turned to
the wych-elm.

on their way back to the farm she spoke of her old
friend much more clearly than before.  in the house margaret
had wondered whether she quite distinguished the first wife
from the second.  now she said: "i never saw much of ruth
after her grandmother died, but we stayed civil.  it was a
very civil family.  old mrs. howard never spoke against
anybody, nor let anyone be turned away without food.  then
it was never 'trespassers will be prosecuted' in their land,
but

would people please not come in.  mrs. howard was never
created to run a farm."

"had they no men to help them?" margaret asked.

miss avery replied: "things went on until there were no men."

"until mr. wilcox came along," corrected margaret,
anxious that her husband should receive his dues.

"i suppose so; but ruth should have married a--no
disrespect to you to say this, for i take it you were
intended to get wilcox any way, whether she got him first or
no."

"whom should she have married?"

"a soldier!" exclaimed the old woman.  "some real soldier."

margaret was silent.  it was a criticism of henry's
character far more trenchant
 
 ___________________________
 
 than any of her own.  she felt
dissatisfied.

"but that's all over," she went on.  "a better time is
coming now, though you've kept me long enough waiting.  in a
couple of weeks i'll see your lights shining through the
hedge of an evening.  have you ordered in coals?"

"we are not coming," said margaret firmly.  she
respected miss avery too much to humour her.  "no.  not
coming.  never coming.  it has all been a mistake.  the
furniture must be repacked at once, and i am very sorry but
i am making other arrangements, and must ask you to give me
the keys."

"certainly, mrs. wilcox," said miss avery, and resigned
her duties with a smile.

relieved at this conclusion, and having sent her
compliments to madge, margaret walked back to the station.
she had intended to go to the furniture warehouse and give
directions for removal, but

"how?"

"don't ask me."


chapter 35

one speaks of the moods of spring, but the days that are her
true children have only one mood; they are all full of the
rising and dropping of winds, and the whistling of birds.
new flowers may come out, the green embroidery of the hedges
increase, but the same heaven broods overhead, soft, thick,
and blue, the same figures, seen and unseen, are wandering
by coppice and meadow.  the morning that margaret had spent
with miss avery, and the afternoon she set out to entrap
helen, were the scales of a single balance.  time might
never have moved, rain never have fallen, and man alone,
with his schemes and ailments, was troubling nature until he
saw her through a veil of tears.

she protested no more.  whether henry was right or
wrong, he was most kind, and she knew of no other standard
by which to judge him.  she must trust him absolutely.  as
soon as he had taken up a business, his obtuseness
vanished.  he profited by the

 human rights, and
it seemed to margaret that all schlegels were threatened
with her.  "were they normal?"  what a question to ask!  and
it is always those who know nothing about human nature, who
are bored by psychology and shocked by physiology, who ask
it.  however piteous her sister's state, she knew that she
must be on her side.  they would be mad together if the
world chose to consider them so.

it was now five minutes past three.  the car slowed down
by the farm, in the yard of which miss avery was standing.
henry asked her whether a cab had gone past.  she nodded,
and the next moment they caught sight of it, at the end of
the lane.  the car ran silently like a beast of prey.  so
unsuspicious was helen that she was sitting on the porch,
with her back to the road.  she had come.  only her head and
shoulders were visible.  she sat framed in the vine, and one
of her hands played with the buds.  the wind ruffled her
hair, the sun glorified it; she was as she had always been.

margaret was

"the house is dead," said margaret with a frown.  "why
worry on about it?"

"but i am interested.  you talk as if i had lost all my
interest in life.  i am still helen, i hope.  now this
hasn't the feel of a dead house.  the hall seems more alive
even than in the old days, when it held the wilcoxes' own things."

"interested, are you?  very well, i must tell you, i
suppose.  my husband lent it on condition we--but by a
mistake all our things were unpacked, and miss avery,
instead of--" she stopped.  "look here, i can't go on like
this.  i warn you i won't.  helen, why should you be so
miserably unkind to me, simply because you hate henry?"

"i don't hate him now," said helen.  "i have stopped
being a schoolgirl, and, meg, once again, i'm not being
unkind.  but as for fitting in with your english life--no,
put it out of your head at once.  imagine a visit from me at
ducie street!  it's unthinkable."

margaret could not contradict her.  it was appalling to

helen had not followed her into the garden.  the door
once open, she lost her inclination to fly.  she remained in
the hall, going from bookcase to table.  she grew more like
the old helen, irresponsible and charming.

"this is mr. wilcox's house?" she inquired.

"surely you remember howards end?"

"remember?  i who remember everything!  but it looks to
be ours now."

"miss avery was extraordinary," said margaret, her own
spirits lightening a little.  again she was invaded by a
slight feeling of disloyalty.  but it brought her relief,
and she yielded to it.  "she loved mrs. wilcox, and would
rather furnish her house with our things than think of it
empty.  in consequence here are all the library books. "

"not all the books.  she hasn't unpacked the art books,
in which she may show her sense.  and we never used to have
the sword here."

"the sword looks well, though."

"you still have a mania for under-furnishing.  would you
care to come into the dining-room before you start?  there's
no carpet there.

they went in, and each minute their talk became more natural.

"oh, what a place for mother's chiffonier!" cried helen.

"look at the chairs, though."

"oh, look at them!  wickham place faced north, didn't it?"

"north-west."

"anyhow, it is thirty years since any of those chairs
have felt the sun.  feel.  their little backs are quite warm."

"but why has miss avery made them set to partners?  i
shall just--"

"over here, meg.  put it so that any one sitting will
see the lawn."

margaret moved a chair.  helen sat down in it.

"ye-es.  the window's too high."

"try a drawing-room chair."

"no, i don't like the drawing-room so much.  the beam
has been match-boarded.  it would have been so beautiful
otherwise. "

"helen, what a memory you have for some things!  you're
perfectly right.  it's a room that men have spoilt through
trying to make it nice for women.

here would after all be a
future, with laughter and the voices of children.  helen,
still smiling, came up to her sister.  she said, "it is
always meg." they looked into each other's eyes.  the inner
life had paid.

solemnly the clapper tolled.  no one was in the front.
margaret went to the kitchen, and struggled between
packing-cases to the window.  their visitor was only a
little boy with a tin can.  and triviality returned.

"little boy, what do you want?"

"please, i am the milk."

"did miss avery send you?" said margaret, rather sharply.

"yes, please."

"then take it back and say we require no milk." while
she called to helen, "no, it's not the siege, but possibly
an attempt to provision us against one."

"but i like milk," cried helen.  "why send it away?"

"do you?  oh, very well.  but we've nothing to put it
in, and he wants the can."

"please, i'm to call in the morning for the can," said
the boy.

"the house will be locked up then."

"in the morning would i bring eggs, too?"

"are

"what is it?"

"drink some milk to steady you."

margaret obeyed.

"no, i won't tell you yet," said helen, "because you may
laugh or be angry.  let's go upstairs first and give the
rooms an airing."

they opened window after window, till the inside, too,
was rustling to the spring.  curtains blew, picture-frames
tapped cheerfully.  helen uttered cries of excitement as she
found this bed obviously in its right place, that in its
wrong one.  she was angry with miss avery for not having
moved the wardrobes up.  "then one would see really." she
admired the view.  she was the helen who had written the
memorable letters four years ago.  as they leant out,
looking westward, she said: "about my idea.  couldn't you
and i camp out in this house for the night?"

"i don't think we could well do that," said margaret.

"here are beds, tables, towels--"

"i know; but the house isn't supposed to be slept in,
and henry's suggestion was--"

"i require no suggestions.  i shall

was the touch of selfishness, which was not enough to
mar helen's character, and even added to its beauty.  she
would have stopped without leave, and escaped to germany the
next morning.  margaret kissed her.

"expect me back before dark.  i am looking forward to it
so much.  it is like you to have thought of such a beautiful
thing."

"not a thing, only an ending," said helen rather sadly;
and the sense of tragedy closed in on margaret again as soon
as she left the house.

she was afraid of miss avery.  it is disquieting to
fulfil a prophecy, however superficially.  she was glad to
see no watching figure as she drove past the farm, but only
little tom, turning somersaults in the straw.


chapter 38

the tragedy began quietly enough, and like many another
talk, by the man's deft assertion of his superiority.  henry
heard her arguing with the driver, stepped out and settled
the fellow, who was inclined to be rude, and then led the
way to some chairs on the lawn.  dolly, who had not been

ything.  she is the house, and the tree that leans
over it.  people have their own deaths as well as their own
lives, and even if there is nothing beyond death, we shall
differ in our nothingness.  i cannot believe that knowledge
such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine.  she
knew about realities.  she knew when people were in love,
though she was not in the room.  i don't doubt that she knew
when henry deceived her."

"good-night, mrs. wilcox," called a voice.

"oh, good-night, miss avery."

"why should miss avery work for us?" helen murmured.

"why, indeed?"

miss avery crossed the lawn and merged into the hedge
that divided it from the farm.  an old gap, which mr. wilcox
had filled up, had reappeared, and her track through the dew
followed the path that he had turfed over, when he improved
the garden and made it possible for games.

"this is not quite our house yet," said helen.  "when
miss avery called, i felt we are only a couple of tourists."

"we shall be that everywhere,

descended.  it hurt him, not where it descended, but in the
heart.  books fell over him in a shower.  nothing had sense.

"get some water," commanded charles, who had all through
kept very calm.  "he's shamming.  of course i only used the
blade.  here, carry him out into the air."

thinking that he understood these things, margaret
obeyed him.  they laid leonard, who was dead, on the gravel;
helen poured water over him.

"that's enough," said charles.

"yes, murder's enough," said miss avery, coming out of
the house with the sword.


chapter 42

when charles left ducie street he had caught the first train
home, but had no inkling of the newest development until
late at night.  then his father, who had dined alone, sent
for him, and in very grave tones inquired for margaret.

"i don't know where she is, pater," said charles.
"dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for her."

"tell me when she comes in--."

another hour passed.  the servants went to bed, and
charles visited his father

 do what i can for helen, but on the understanding that
they clear out of the house at once.  do you see?  that is a
sine qua non."

"then at eight tomorrow i may go up in the car?"

"eight or earlier.  say that you are acting as my
representative, and, of course, use no violence, charles."

on the morrow, as charles returned, leaving leonard dead
upon the gravel, it did not seem to him that he had used
violence.  death was due to heart disease.  his stepmother
herself had said so, and even miss avery had acknowledged
that he only used the flat of the sword.  on his way through
the village he informed the police, who thanked him, and
said there must be an inquest.  he found his father in the
garden shading his eyes from the sun.

"it has been pretty horrible," said charles gravely.
"they were there, and they had the man up there with them too."

"what--what man?"

"i told you last night.  his name was bast."

"my god, is it possible?" said mr. wilcox.  "in your
mother's house!  charles, in y

our mother's house!"

"i know, pater.  that was what i felt.  as a matter of
fact, there is no need to trouble about the man.  he was in
the last stages of heart disease, and just before i could
show him what i thought of him he went off.  the police are
seeing about it at this moment."

mr. wilcox listened attentively.

"i got up there--oh, it couldn't have been more than
half-past seven.  the avery woman was lighting a fire for
them.  they were still upstairs.  i waited in the
drawing-room.  we were all moderately civil and collected,
though i had my suspicions.  i gave them your message, and
mrs. wilcox said, 'oh yes, i see; yes,' in that way of hers."

"nothing else?"

"i promised to tell you, 'with her love,' that she was
going to germany with her sister this evening.  that was all
we had time for."

mr. wilcox seemed relieved.

"because by then i suppose the man got tired of hiding,

ordered insanity, where the king takes the queen, and the

behind, such as the man at her feet had yearned for; there
was hope this side of the grave; there were truer
relationships beyond the limits that fetter us now.  as a
prisoner looks up and sees stars beckoning, so she, from the
turmoil and horror of those days, caught glimpses of the
diviner wheels.

the child's sake, and miss avery, calm, but murmuring
tenderly, "no one ever told the lad he'll have a
child"--they also reminded her that horror is not the end.
to what ultimate harmony we tend she did not know, but there
seemed great chance that a child would be born into the

nothing else to be done; the time for telegrams and anger
