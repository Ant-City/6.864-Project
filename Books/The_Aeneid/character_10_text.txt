  one summer's night and one whole day they pass
  betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.
  the fiery sun had finish'd half his race,
  look'd back, and doubted in the middle space,
  when they from far beheld the rising tow'rs,
  the tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs,
  thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,
  now rise in marble, from the roman sway.
  these cots (evander's kingdom, mean and poor)
  the trojan saw, and turn'd his ships to shore.
  't was on a solemn day: th' arcadian states,
  the king and prince, without the city gates,
  then paid their off'rings in a sacred grove
  to hercules, the warrior son of jove.
  thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,

  he said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes
  evander view'd the man with vast surprise,
  pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face:
  then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace:
  "o valiant leader of the trojan line,

  on sods of turf he set the soldiers round:
  a maple throne, rais'd higher from the ground,
  receiv'd the trojan chief; and, o'er the bed,
  a lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread.
  the loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine
  in bowls; the priest renew'd the rites divine:
  broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine.

  but when the rage of hunger was repress'd,
  thus spoke evander to his royal guest:
  "these rites, these altars, and this feast, o king,
  from no vain fears or superstition spring,
  or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,
  or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;
  but, sav'd from danger, with a grateful sense,
  the labors of a god we recompense.

  ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:

  this said, a double wreath evander twin'd,
  and poplars black and white his temples bind.
  then brims his ample bowl. with like design
  the rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.
  meantime the sun descended from the skies,
  and the bright evening star began to rise.
  and now the priests, potitius at their head,

  th' arcadians thought him jove; and said they saw
  the mighty thund'rer with majestic awe,
  who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,
  and scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground.
  then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood
  two stately towns, on either side the flood,)
  saturnia's and janicula's remains;
  and either place the founder's name retains.
  discoursing thus together, they resort
  where poor evander kept his country court.
  they view'd the ground of rome's litigious hall;
  (once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;)
  then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd,
  when thus the king bespoke his trojan guest:
  "mean as it is, this palace, and this door,
  receiv'd alcides, then a conqueror.
  dare to be poor; accept our homely food,
  which feasted him, and emulate a god."

  by turns their hands descend, and hammers chime.
  they turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs;
  the fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs.

  while, at the lemnian god's command, they urge
  their labors thus, and ply th' aeolian forge,
  the cheerful morn salutes evander's eyes,
  and songs of chirping birds invite to rise.
  he leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet

  th' intended march, amid the fearful crowd:
  the matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears,
  and double their devotion in their fears.
  the war at hand appears with more affright,
  and rises ev'ry moment to the sight.

  then old evander, with a close embrace,
  strain'd his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his face.
  "would heav'n," said he, "my strength and youth recall,
  such as i was beneath praeneste's wall;
  then when i made the foremost foes retire,
  and set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire;
  when herilus in single fight i slew,
  whom with three lives feronia did endue;
  and thrice i sent him to the stygian shore,

  and there was mnestheus too, increas'd in fame,
  since turnus from the camp he cast with shame.

  thus mortal war was wag'd on either side.
  meantime the hero cuts the nightly tide:
  for, anxious, from evander when he went,
  he sought the tyrrhene camp, and tarchon's tent;
  expos'd the cause of coming to the chief;
  his name and country told, and ask'd relief;
  propos'd the terms; his own small strength declar'd;
  what vengeance proud mezentius had prepar'd:
  what turnus, bold and violent, design'd;
  then shew'd the slipp'ry state of humankind,
  and fickle fortune; warn'd him to beware,
  and to his wholesome counsel added pray'r.

  bending his neck, and spurning back the sand-
  runs roaring downward from his hilly stand:
  imagine eager turnus not more slow,
  to rush from high on his unequal foe.

  young pallas, when he saw the chief advance
  within due distance of his flying lance,
  prepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try
  if fortune would his want of force supply;
  and thus to heav'n and hercules address'd:
  "alcides, once on earth evander's guest,
  his son adjures you by those holy rites,
  that hospitable board, those genial nights;
  assist my great attempt to gain this prize,
  and let proud turnus view, with dying eyes,
  his ravish'd spoils." 't was heard, the vain request;
  alcides mourn'd, and stifled sighs within his breast.
  then jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began:
  "short bounds of life are set to mortal man.

raises, to thy sire, at once deplor'd!
  one day first sent thee to the fighting field,
  beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd;
  one day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield.
  this dismal news, not from uncertain fame,
  but sad spectators, to the hero came:
  his friends upon the brink of ruin stand,
  unless reliev'd by his victorious hand.
  he whirls his sword around, without delay,
  and hews thro' adverse foes an ample way,
  to find fierce turnus, of his conquest proud:
  evander, pallas, all that friendship ow'd
  to large deserts, are present to his eyes;
  his plighted hand, and hospitable ties.

  four sons of sulmo, four whom ufens bred,
  he took in fight, and living victims led,
  to please the ghost of pallas, and expire,
  in sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire.
  at magus next he threw: he stoop'd below
  the flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow;
  then, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd:
  "by young iulus, by thy father's shade,
  o spare m

s armor, from the trojan pirate torn,
  by my triumphant lausus shall be worn."
  he said; and with his utmost force he threw
  the massy spear, which, hissing as it flew,
  reach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the course;
  but, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force
  took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt
  the side and bowels fam'd anthores fix'd.
  anthores had from argos travel'd far,
  alcides' friend, and brother of the war;
  till, tir'd with toils, fair italy he chose,
  and in evander's palace sought repose.
  now, falling by another's wound, his eyes
  he cast to heav'n, on argos thinks, and dies.

  the pious trojan then his jav'lin sent;
  the shield gave way; thro' treble plates it went
  of solid brass, of linen trebly roll'd,
  and three bull hides which round the buckler fold.
  all these it pass'd, resistless in the course,
  transpierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying force.
  the gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood.

y chance;
  that none unwarn'd may plead his ignorance,
  and i, at heav'n's appointed hour, may find
  your warlike ensigns waving in the wind.
  meantime the rites and fun'ral pomps prepare,
  due to your dead companions of the war:
  the last respect the living can bestow,
  to shield their shadows from contempt below.
  that conquer'd earth be theirs, for which they fought,
  and which for us with their own blood they bought;
  but first the corpse of our unhappy friend
  to the sad city of evander send,
  who, not inglorious, in his age's bloom,
  was hurried hence by too severe a doom."

  thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,
  where, new in death, lamented pallas lay.
  acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd
  the father's trust; and now the son he serv'd
  with equal faith, but less auspicious care.
  th' attendants of the slain his sorrow share.
  a troop of trojans mix'd with these appear,
  and mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair.
  soon as the prince appears,

  thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd:

  he died no death to make thee wish, too late,
  thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate:
  but what a champion has th' ausonian coast,
  and what a friend hast thou, ascanius, lost!"

  thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around,
  to raise the breathless body from the ground;
  and chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all
  his warlike troops, to wait the funeral,
  to bear him back and share evander's grief:
  a well-becoming, but a weak relief.
  of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,
  then on their shoulders the sad burden rear.
  the body on this rural hearse is borne:
  strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.
  all pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow'r,
  new cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r:
  unfaded yet, but yet unfed below,
  no more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe.

 from out the gate, the people stand,
  each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand.
  wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:
  the fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze,
  that cast a sullen splendor on their friends,
  the marching troop which their dead prince attends.
  both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;
  the matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,
  and their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky.
  the town is fill'd with tumult and with tears,
  till the loud clamors reach evander's ears:
  forgetful of his state, he runs along,
  with a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng;
  falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,
  with silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.
  short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks
  a passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:

  "o pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,
  to fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!
