[CHARACTER] 
though only twenty-two, [CHARACTER] is the product of passion,
hard work, and travel. he is a man of great integrity, as we learn
when he does not take advantage of the hypnotized phoebe and when
he supports and comforts the despondent hepzibah. although hepzibah views
[CHARACTER]'s friends as disreputable, the young man's politics come
across as boldly exciting, rich with vitality and possibility. [CHARACTER]
is not without a dark side and foibles, and the familiar maule bitterness
toward the pyncheon family infects him as well. this sense of bitterness
and rancor shows how [CHARACTER] continues the maule legacy of revenge
and faulty judgment. his politics, once so inspiring, end up seeming
rather flimsy; they crumble almost overnight once he has won phoebe's
love and seen the judge dead. moreover, he has a tendency to underestimate
others, brashly assuming that he can read phoebe like a book. overall,
though, [CHARACTER] emerges as a sympathetic figure, and his decision
not to abuse his family powers of hypnosis helps to diminish some
of the family stigma he bears.
