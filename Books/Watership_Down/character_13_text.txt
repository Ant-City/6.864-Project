d fiver remained in the ditch, nibbling halfheartedly at the dark
grass. at last hazel heard what he was listening for; a rabbit -- or was it two? --
approaching from the wood.
     a few moments later bigwig was in the ditch. behind him came a hefty, brisk-
looking rabbit something over twelve months old. he was well known by sight to
all the warren, for his fur was entirely gray, with patches of near-white that now
caught the moonlight as he sat scratching himself without speaking. this was

silver, a nephew of the threarah, who was serving his first month in the owsla.
     hazel could not help feeling relieved that bigwig had brought only silver -- a
quiet, straightforward fellow who had not yet really found his feet among the
veterans. when bigwig had spoken earlier of sounding out the owsla, hazel had
been in two minds. it was only too likely that they would encounter dangers
beyond the warren and that they would stand in need of some good fighters.
again, if fiver was right and the w

hole warren was in imminent peril, then of
course they ought to welcome any rabbit who was ready to join them. on the
other hand, there seemed no point in taking particular pains to get hold of rabbits
who were going to behave like toadflax.
     "wherever we settle down in the end," thought hazel, "i'm determined to see
that pipkin and fiver aren't sat on and cuffed around until they're ready to run
any risk just to get away. but is bigwig going to see it like that?"
     "you know silver, don't you?" asked bigwig, breaking in on his thoughts.
"apparently some of the younger fellows in the owsla have been giving him a thin
time -- teasing him about his fur, you know, and saying he only got his place
because of the threarah. i thought i was going to get some more, but i suppose
nearly all the owsla feel they're very well off as they are."
     he looked about him. "i say, there aren't many here, are there? do you think
it's really worth going on with this idea?"

ommon with himself and his
companions, started and sat up tensely. fiver muttered in his ear, "oh, hazel,
they've come to--" but broke off short. bigwig turned toward them and stared, his
nose working rapidly. the three came straight up to him.
     "thlayli?" said the leader.
     "you know me perfectly well," replied bigwig, "and i know you, holly. what do
you want?"
     "you're under arrest."
     "under arrest? what do you mean? what for?"
     "spreading dissension and inciting to mutiny. silver, you're under arrest too,
for failing to report to toadflax this evening and causing your duty to devolve on
a comrade. you're both to come with me."
     immediately bigwig fell upon him, scratching and kicking. holly fought back.
his followers closed in, looking for an opening to join the fight and pin bigwig
down. suddenly, from the top of the bank, buckthorn flung himself headlong into
the scuffle, knocked one of the guards flying with a kick from his back legs and
then closed with the othe

e embleer* river as many times as you like. always glad to
oblige."
     without the slightest hesitation, he took two hops to the water, waded in and
swam across the deep, still pool. they watched him pull himself out beside a
flowering clump of figwort, gripping one of the tough stems in his teeth, shake a
shower of drops out of his fur and scutter into the alder bushes. a moment later,
between the nut trees, they saw him running off into the field.
     "i'm glad he's with us," said hazel to silver. again he thought wryly of the
threarah. "he's the fellow to find out all we need to know. oh, i say, look, he's
coming back already."
     bigwig was racing back across the field, looking more agitated than he had at
any time since the encounter with captain holly. he ran into the water almost
headlong and paddled over fast, leaving an arrowhead ripple on the calm brown
surface. he was speaking as he jerked himself out on the sandy foreshore.
     "well, hazel, if i were you i shouldn't wait u

r.
     "frithrah, yes, i see!" said an excited voice at his ear. it was fiver. "quick,
hazel, don't wait! come on, and bring pipkin!"
     it was blackberry who bullied the stupefied pipkin to his feet and forced him to
limp the few yards to the gravel spit. the piece of wood, hardly bigger than a large
rhubarb leaf, was lightly aground. blackberry almost drove pipkin onto it with his
claws. pipkin crouched shivering and fiver followed him aboard.
     "who's strong?" said blackberry. "bigwig! silver! push it out!"
     no one obeyed him. all squatted, puzzled and uncertain. blackberry buried his
nose in the gravel under the landward edge of the board and raised it, pushing.
the board tipped. pipkin squealed and fiver lowered his head and splayed his
claws. then the board righted itself and drifted out a few feet into the pool with
the two rabbits hunched upon it, rigid and motionless. it rotated slowly and they
found themselves staring back at their comrades.
     "frith and inl√©!" said d

few minutes hazel had been as near to losing his head as he
was ever to come. he had been at his wits' end, with no reply to bigwig's scornful
impatience except his readiness to risk his own life in company with fiver and
pipkin. he still could not understand what had happened, but at least he realized
that blackberry wanted him to show authority. his head cleared.
     "swim," he said. "everybody swim."
     he watched them as they went in. dandelion swam as well as he ran, swiftly
and easily. silver, too, was strong. the others paddled and scrambled over

somehow, and as they began to reach the other side, hazel plunged. the cold
water penetrated his fur almost at once. his breath came short and as his head
went under he could hear a faint grating of gravel along the bottom. he paddled
across awkwardly, his head tilted high out of the water, and made for the figwort.
as he pulled himself out, he looked round among the sopping rabbits in the
alders.
     "where's bigwig?" he asked.
     "b

he had been in a field of
turnips. but this was entirely different from any of those and seemed, somehow,
attractive, wholesome, propitious. true, rabbits could not eat these plants: he
could smell that. but they could lie safely among them for as long as they liked,
and they could move through them easily and unseen. hazel determined then and
there to bring the rabbits up to the beanfield to shelter and rest until the evening.
he ran back and found the others where he had left them. bigwig and silver were
awake, but all the rest were still napping uneasily.
     "not asleep, silver?" he said.
     "it's too dangerous, hazel," replied silver. "i'd like to sleep as much as anyone,
but if we all sleep and something comes, who's going to spot it?"
     "i know. i've found a place where we can sleep safely for as long as we like."
     "a burrow?"
     "no, not a burrow. a great field of scented plants that will cover us, sight and
smell, until we're rested. come out here and smell it, if you li

ke."
     both rabbits did so. "you say you've seen these plants?" said bigwig, turning
his ears to catch the distant rustling of the beans."

     "yes, they're only just over the top. come on, let's get the others moving before
a man comes with a hrududu* or they'll scatter all over the place."
     silver roused the others and began to coax them into the field. they stumbled
out drowsily, responding with reluctance to his repeated assurance that it was
"only a little way."
     they became widely separated as they straggled up the slope. silver and bigwig
led the way, with hazel and buckthorn a short distance behind. the rest idled
along, hopping a few yards and then pausing to nibble or to pass droppings on the
warm, sunny grass. silver was almost at the crest when suddenly, from halfway
up, th

 covered the distance down the slope in a few seconds. he had no idea
what he was going to do, and if the crow had ignored him he would probably have
been at a loss. but by dashing up he distracted its attention and it turned on him.
he swerved past it, stopped and, looking back, saw bigwig come racing in from
the opposite side. the crow turned again, struck at bigwig and missed. hazel
heard its beak hit a pebble in the grass with a sound like a snail shell when a
thrush beats it on a stone. as silver followed bigwig, it recovered itself and faced
him squarely. silver stopped short in fear and the crow seemed to dance before
him, its great black wings flapping in a horrible commotion. it was just about to
stab when bigwig ran straight into it from behind and knocked it sideways, so
that it staggered across the turf with a harsh, raucous cawing of rage.
     "keep at it!" cried bigwig. "come in behind it! they're cowards! they only
attack helpless rabbits."
     but already the crow was makin

wood pigeons' wings among the branches. in an
instant the rabbits were running in all directions through the bean rows, each one
tearing by instinct toward holes that were not there.
     hazel stopped short on the edge of the beans. looking about him, he could see
none of the others. he waited, trembling, for the next shot: but there was silence.
then he felt, vibrating along the ground, the steady tread of a man going away
beyond the crest over which they had come that morning. at that moment silver
appeared, pushing his way through the plants close by.
     "i hope it's the crow, don't you?" said silver.

     "i hope no one's been silly enough to bolt out of this field," answered hazel.
"they're all scattered. how can we find them?"
     "i don't think we can," said silver. "we'd better go back to where we were.
they'll come in time."
     it was in fact a long time before all the rabbits had come back to the hollow in
the middle of the field. as he waited, hazel realized more fully tha

run on it -- faster than we can; and what else can run faster than we?"
     "it's dangerous, then? they can catch us?"
     "no, that's what's so odd. they don't take any notice of us at all. i'll show you,
if you like."
     the other rabbits were beginning to reach the hedge as bigwig hopped down
the bank and crouched on the verge of the road. from beyond the bend came the
sound of another approaching car. hazel and silver watched tensely. the car
appeared, flashing green and white, and raced down toward bigwig. for an
instant it filled the whole world with noise and fear. then it was gone and
bigwig's fur was blowing in the whack of wind that followed it down the hedges.
he jumped back up the bank among the staring rabbits.
     "see? they don't hurt you," said bigwig. "as a matter of fact, i don't think
they're alive at all. but i must admit i can't altogether make it out."

     "well, it will be dark soon," said hazel. "come on, let's get across. as far as i
can see, this road's no good to us at all. now that i've learned about it, i want to
get away from it as soon as i can."
     by moonrise they had made their way through newtown churchyard, where a
little brook runs between the lawns and under the path. wandering on, they
climbed a hill and came to newtown common -- a country of peat, gorse and
silver birch. after the meadows they had left, this was a strange, forbidding land.
trees, herbage, even the soil -- all were unfamiliar. they hesitated among the
thick heather, unable to see more than a few feet ahead. their fur became soaked

with the dew. the ground was broken by rifts and pits of naked black peat, where
water lay and sharp white stones, some as big as a pigeon's, some as a rabbit's
skull, glimmered in the moonlight. whenever they reached one of these rifts the
rabbits huddled tog

there enough trouble and danger already?"
     they went over to the far end of the pit. bigwig and silver were talking with
buckthorn under an overhanging broom. nearby, pipkin and dandelion were
pretending to feed on a patch of scrub. some way away, acorn was making a great

business of licking hawkbit's throat, while speedwell watched.
     "keep still if you can, poor old chap," said acorn, who obviously wanted to be
overheard. "just let me clean the blood out. steady, now!" hawkbit winced in an
exaggerated manner and backed away. as hazel came up, all the rabbits turned

on struck the smell of a stoat and they all
joined him, whispering and sniffing over the ground. but the scent was old and
after a time they went on again. in this low undergrowth their disorganized
progress and uneven, differing rhythms of movement delayed them still more
than in the wood. there were continual stampings of alarm, pausing, freezing to
the spot at the sound of movement real or imagined. it was so dark that hazel
seldom knew for certain whether he was leading or whether bigwig or silver
might not be ahead. once, hearing an unaccountable noise in front of him, which
ceased on the instant, he kept still for a long time; and when at last he moved
cautiously forward, found silver crouching behind a tussock of cocksfoot for fear
of the sound of his own approach. all was confusion, ignorance, clambering and
exhaustion. throughout the bad dream of the night's journey, pipkin seemed to
be always close beside him. though each of the others vanished and reappeared

e track.
     "he's done it! didn't i tell you he'd do it?"
     hazel turned his head and saw blackberry on the path. he was bedraggled and
exhausted, but it was he who was speaking. out of the heather behind him came
acorn, speedwell and buckthorn. all four rabbits were now staring straight at
him. he wondered why. then, as they approached, he realized that they were
looking not at him, but past him at something further off. he turned round. the
gravel track led downhill into a narrow belt of silver birch and rowan. beyond was
a thin hedge; and beyond that, a green field between two copses. they had
reached the other side of the common.
     "oh, hazel," said blackberry, coming up to him round a puddle in the gravel. "i
was so tired and confused, i actually began to wonder whether you knew where
you were going. i could hear you in the heather, saying 'not far now' and it was
annoying me. i thought you were making it up. i should have known better.

was off, slowly enough, down the slope, but when hazel stamped for him to stop
he did so at once.
     "where are the others?" said hazel. "dandelion? bigwig?"
     at that moment dandelion appeared out of the heather and sat on the path,
looking at the field. he was followed first by hawkbit and then by fiver. hazel
was watching fiver as he took in the sight of the field, when buckthorn drew his
attention back to the foot of the slope.
     "look, hazel," he said, "silver and bigwig are down there. they're waiting for
us."
     silver's light-gray fur showed up plainly against a low spray of gorse, but hazel
could not see bigwig until he sat up and ran toward them.
     "splendid, hazel," he said. "everybody's here. let's get them into that field."
     a few moments later they were under the silver birches and as the sun rose,
striking flashes of red and green from the drops on ferns and twigs, they
scrambled through the hedge, across a shallow ditch and into t

     the tired rabbits fed and basked in the sunny meadow as though they had
come no further than from the bank at the edge of the nearby copse. the heather
and the stumbling darkness were forgotten as though the sunrise had melted
them. bigwig and hawkbit chased each other through the long grass. speedwell
jumped over the little brook that ran down the middle of the field and when
acorn tried to follow him and fell short, silver joked with him as he scrambled
out and rolled him in a patch of dead oak leaves until he was dry. as the sun rose
higher, shortening the shadows and drawing the dew from the grass, most of the
rabbits came wandering back to the sun-flecked shade among the cow parsley
along the edge of the ditch. here, hazel and fiver were sitting with dandelion
under a flowering wild cherry. the white petals spun down around them,
covering the grass and speckling their fur, while thirty feet above a thrush sang

there's no need to do any serious digging, is there?" said bigwig. "that
sort of thing's all right for does, but not for us."
     "still, we'd better make one or two scrapes, don't you think?" said hazel.
"something to give us shelter at a pinch. let's go up to the copse and look round.
we might as well take our time and make quite sure where we'd like to have
them. we don't want to have to do the work twice."

     "yes, that's the style," said bigwig. "and while you're doing that, i'll take silver
and buckthorn here and have a run down the fields beyond, just to get the lie of
the land and make sure there isn't anything dangerous."
     the three explorers set off beside the brook, while hazel led the other rabbits
across the field and up to the edge of the woodland. they went slowly along the
foot of the bank, pushing in and out of the clumps of red campion and ragged
robin. from time to time one or another would begin to scrape in the gravelly
bank, or venture a little way in among the

 thought hazel wryly, teeth and claws would make no impression on that
great, firm body and shining pelt.
     when they reached the ditch, all the other rabbits were squatting together,
watching their approach. hazel stopped in front of them but did not know what
to say. if the stranger had not been there, he would have given them an account of

what had happened. if blackberry and he had driven the stranger across the field
by force, he could have handed him over for safekeeping to bigwig or silver. but
to have him sitting beside him, looking his followers over in silence and
courteously waiting for someone else to speak first -- this was a situation beyond
hazel's experience. it was bigwig, straightforward and blunt as always, who broke
the tension.
     "who is this, hazel?" he said. "why has he come back with you?"
     "i don't know," answered hazel, trying to look frank and feeling foolish. "he
came of his own accord."
     "well, we'd better ask him, then," said bigwig, with somethi

     he ran down the slope and over the brook. they watched him leap the bank of
the further copse and disappear through the green bracken. the first scatters of
rain were beginning to fall, pattering into the oak leaves and pricking the bare
pink skin inside their ears.
     "fine, big fellow, isn't he?" said buckthorn. "he doesn't look as though he had
much to bother about, living here."
     "what should we do, hazel, do you think?" asked silver. "it's true what he said,
isn't it? these scrapes -- well, we can crouch in them out of the weather, but no
more than that. and as we can't all get into one, we shall have to split up."
     "we'll join them together," said hazel, "and while we're doing that i'd like to
talk about what he said. fiver, bigwig and blackberry, can you come with me?
the rest of you split how you like."
     the new hole was short, narrow and rough. there was no room for two rabbits
to pass. four were like beans in

on fiver and now, when he really needed him, he was letting them down.
blackberry's reasoning had been first-rate and bigwig had at least shown which
way any sound-hearted rabbit would be likely to lean. apparently the only
contribution fiver could make was this beetle-spirited vaporing. he tried to
remember that fiver was undersized and that they had had an anxious time and
were all weary. at this moment the soil at the far end of the burrow began to
crumble inward, then it fell away and silver's head and front paws appeared.
     "here we are," said silver cheerfully. "we've done what you wanted, hazel, and
buckthorn's through next door. but what i'd like to know is, how about what's-
his-name? cowpat -- no -- cowslip? are we going to his warren or not? surely
we're not going to sit cowering in this place because we're frightened to go and
see him. whatever will he think of us?"
     "i'll tell you," said dandelion, from over his shoulder. "if he's not honest, he'll
know we're afraid

 to come; and if he is, he'll think we're suspicious, cowardly
skulkers. if we're going to live in these fields, we'll have to get on terms with his
lot sooner or later, and it goes against the grain to hang about and admit we
daren't visit them."
     "i don't know how many of them there are," said silver, "but we're quite a
crowd. anyhow, i hate the idea of just keeping away. how long have rabbits been
elil? old cowslip wasn't afraid to come into the middle of us, was he?"
     "very well," said hazel. "that's how i feel myself. i just wanted to know
whether you did. would you like bigwig and me to go over there first, by
ourselves, and report back?"
     "no," said silver. "let's all go. if we're going at all, for frith's sake let's do it as
though we weren't afraid. what do you say, dandelion

     "i think you're right."
     "then we'll go now," said hazel. "get the others and follow me."

into his eyes and under his scut, he watched them as they joined him. blackberry,
alert and intelligent, looking first up and then down the ditch before he crossed it.
bigwig, cheerful at the prospect of action. the steady, reliable silver. dandelion,
the dashing storyteller, so eager to be off that he jumped the ditch and ran a little
way into the field before stopping to wait for the rest. buckthorn, perhaps the
most sensible and staunch of them all. pipkin, who looked round for hazel and
then came over to wait beside him. acorn, hawkbit and speedwell, decent
enough rank-and-filers as long as they were not pushed beyond their limits. last
of all came fiver, dejected and reluctant as a sparrow in the frost. as hazel turned

of watery, pale gold light.

     "now, brace up, fiver!" he said aloud. "we're waiting for you, and getting
wetter every moment."
     a soaking bumblebee crawled over a thistle bloom, vibrated its wings for a few
seconds and then flew away down the field. hazel followed, leaving a dark track
behind him over the silvered grass.

there was a good deal of air ahead of him -- he could feel it moving -- and there
was a considerable space above his head. also, there were several rabbits near
him. it had not occurred to him that there would be a place underground where
he would be exposed on three sides. he backed quickly and felt pipkin at his tail.
"what a fool i was!" he thought. "why didn't i put silver there?" at this moment
he heard cowslip speaking. he jumped, for he could tell that he was some way
away. the size of the place must be immense.
     "is that you, hazel?" said cowslip. "you're welcome, and so are your friends.
we're glad you've come."

azel, crouched at his ease between two huge rabbits who could
have broken his back in a second, while buckthorn and cowslip started a playful
scuffle, nipping each other like kittens and then breaking off to comb their ears in
a comical pretense of sudden gravity. only fiver sat alone and apart. he seemed
either ill or very much depressed, and the strangers avoided him instinctively.
     the knowledge that the gathering was safely round the corner came to hazel in
the form of a recollection of silver's head and paws breaking through gravel. at
once, he felt warm and relaxed. he had already crossed the whole length of the
hall and was pressed close to two rabbits, a buck and a doe, each of whom was
fully as large as cowslip. when both together took a few slow hops down one of
the runs nearby, hazel followed and little by little they all three moved out of the
hall. they came to a smaller burrow, deeper underground. evidently this
belonged to the couple, for they settled down as though at hom

objection when hazel did the same. here, while the mood of the great hall slowly
passed from them, all three were silent for a time.
     "is cowslip the chief rabbit?" asked hazel at length.
     the other replied with a question. "are you called chief rabbit?"
     hazel found this awkward to answer. if he replied that he was, his new friends
might address him so for the future, and he could imagine what bigwig and silver
would have to say about that. as usual, he fell back on plain honesty.
     "we're only a few," he said. "we left our warren in a hurry to escape from bad
things. most stayed behind and the chief rabbit was one of them. i've been trying
to lead my friends, but i don't know whether they'd care to hear me called chief
rabbit."
     "that'll make him ask a few questions," he thought. "'why did you leave? why
didn't the rest come? what were you afraid of?' and whatever am i going to say?"

fill the warren, anything like. perhaps they've had some sort of trouble that's left
them sad."
     "we don't know because they don't tell us. but if we're going to stay here we've
got to learn to get on with them. we can't fight them: they're too big. and we
don't want them fighting us."
     "i don't believe they can fight, hazel," said pipkin. "although they're so big,
they don't seem like fighters to me. not like bigwig and silver."
     "you notice a lot, don't you, hlao-roo?" said hazel. "do you notice it's raining
harder than ever? i've got enough grass in my stomach for a bit. we'll go down
again now, but let's keep to ourselves for a while."
     "why not sleep?" said blackberry. "it's over a night and a day now and i'm
dropping."
     they returned down a different hole and soon found a dry, empty burrow,
where they curled up together and slept in the warmth of their own tired bodies.

used to taking a good look round when you silflay, but here we generally go
straight out."
     hazel did not mean to alter his ways or take instructions from cowslip.
however, no one had pushed him and there was no point in bickering over trifles.
he hopped across the ditch to the further bank and looked round him again.
several rabbits were already running down the field toward a distant hedge
dappled white with great patches of maybloom. he saw bigwig and silver and
went to join them, flicking the wet off his front paws step by step, like a cat.
     "i hope your friends have been looking after you as well as these fellows have

     fiver made no reply and hazel went back to the field.
     the day was certainly not one to encourage foreboding. by ni-frith it was so
hot that the lower part of the field was humid. the air was heavy with thick,
herbal smells, as though it were already late june; the water mint and marjoram,
not yet flowering, gave off scent from their leaves and here and there an early
meadowsweet stood in bloom. the chiffchaff was busy all morning, high in a
silver birch near the abandoned holes across the dip; and from deep in the copse,
somewhere by the disused well, came the beautiful song of the blackcap. by early
afternoon there was a stillness of heat, and a herd of cows from the higher fields
slowly grazed their way down into the shade. only a few of the rabbits remained
above ground. almost all were asleep in the burrows. but still fiver sat alone
under the yew tree.
     in the early evening hazel sought out bigwig and together they ventured into

     "then prince rainbow saw that el-ahrairah had been as good as his word, and
that he himself must keep his promise, too. he let the rabbits out of the marshes
of kelfazin and they multiplied everywhere. and from that day to this, no power
on earth can keep a rabbit out of a vegetable garden, for el-ahrairah prompts
them with a thousand tricks, the best in the world."

that you saw -- that's old-fashioned now. el-ahrairah doesn't really mean much to
us. not that your friend's story wasn't very charming," he added hastily.
     "el-ahrairah is a trickster," said buckthorn, "and rabbits will always need
tricks."
     "no," said a new voice from the further end of the hall, beyond cowslip.
"rabbits need dignity and, above all, the will to accept their fate."
     "we think silverweed is one of the best poets we've had for many months,"
said cowslip. "his ideas have a great following. would you like to hear him now?"
     "yes, yes," said voices from all sides. "silverweed!"
     "hazel," said fiver suddenly, "i want to get a clear idea of this silverweed, but i
daren't go closer by myself. will you come with me?"
     "why, fiver, whatever do you mean? what is there to be afraid of?"
     "oh, frith help me!" said fiver, trembling. "i can smell him from here. he

     "oh, fiver, don't be absurd! he just smells the same as the rest of them."
     "he smells like barley rained down and left to rot in the fields. he smells like a
wounded mole that can't get underground."
     "he smells like a big, fat rabbit to me, with a lot of carrots inside. but i'll come
with you."
     when they had edged their way through the crowd to the far end of the
burrow, hazel was surprised to realize that silverweed was a mere youngster. in
the sandleford warren no rabbit of his age would have been asked to tell a story,
except perhaps to a few friends alone. he had a wild, desperate air and his ears
twitched continually. as he began to speak, he seemed to grow less and less aware
of his audience and continually turned his head, as though listening to some
sound, audible only to himself, from the entrance tunnel behind him. but there
was an arresting fascination in his voice, like the movement of wind

desperate folly, hazel."
     "what on earth's all this?" said hazel to bigwig in perplexity.
     "he's talking about that lop-eared nitwit of a poet down there," answered
bigwig. "i know that much. but why he seems to think we should want to have
anything to do with him and his fancy talk -- that's more than i can imagine. you
can save your breath, fiver. the only thing that's bothering us is the row you've
started. as for silverweed, all i can say is, i'll keep silver and he can be just plain
weed."
     fiver gazed back at him with eyes that, like a fly's, seemed larger than his head.
"you think that," he said. "you believe that. but each of you, in his own way, is
thick in that mist. where is the--"
     hazel interrupted him and as he did so fiver started. "fiver, i won't pretend
that i didn't follow you up here to speak angrily. you've endangered our good
start in this warren--

is ears drooped. his eyes opened unseeing and the whites showed
bloodshot as the brown irises rolled one way and the other. after a moment his
voice came thick and low, bubbling out of the bloody spume in his mouth.
     "owsla -- no good -- biting wire. peg -- got to -- dig out."
     a convulsion shook him and he scrabbled at the ground, covering himself in a
mask of wet earth and blood. then he was still again.
     "run, fiver, run to the warren," cried hazel. "get the others -- blackberry,
silver. be quick! he'll die."
     fiver was off up the field like a hare. hazel, left alone, tried to understand what
was needed. what was the peg? how was he to dig it out? he looked down at the
foul mess before him. bigwig was lying across the wire, which came out under his
belly and seemed to disappear into the ground. hazel struggled with his own
incomprehension. bigwig had said, "dig." that at least he understood. he began
to scratch into the soft earth beside the body, until after a time his cl

 a moment," said blackberry. "let me think, and try not to be impatient."
     hazel turned his head and looked down the course of the brook. far away,
between the two copses, he could see the cherry tree where two days before he
had sat with blackberry and fiver in the sunrise. he remembered how bigwig had
chased hawkbit through the long grass, forgetting the quarrel of the previous
night in the joy of their arrival. he could see hawkbit running toward him now
and two or three of the others -- silver, dandelion and pipkin. dandelion, well in
front, dashed up to the gap and checked, twitching and staring.
     "what is it, hazel? what's happened? fiver said--"
     "bigwig's in a wire. let him alone till blackberry tells us. stop the others
crowding round."
     dandelion turned and raced back as pipkin came up.
     "is cowslip coming?" said hazel. "perhaps he knows--"
     "he wouldn't come," replied pipkin. "he told fiver to stop talking about it."
     "told him what?" asked hazel incred

ulously. but at that moment blackberry
spoke and hazel was beside him in a flash.
     "this is it," said blackberry. "the wire's on a peg and the peg's in the ground --
there, look. we've got to dig it out. come on -- dig beside it."
     hazel dug once more, his forepaws throwing up the soft, wet soil and slipping
against the hard sides of the peg. dimly, he was aware of the others waiting
nearby. after a time he was forced to stop, panting. silver took his place, and was
followed by buckthorn. the nasty, smooth, clean, man-smelling peg was laid bare
to the length of a rabbit's ear, but still it did not come loose. bigwig had not
moved. he lay across the wire, torn and bloody, with closed eyes. buckthorn drew
his head and paws out of the hole and rubbed the mud off his face.
     "the peg's narrower down there," he said. "it tapers. i think it could be bitten
through, but i can't get my teeth to it."

t, don't you?"
     "yes, hazel. i'm sorry. will bigwig--"
     "and another thing," said hazel desperately. "what was it you were telling me
about cowslip? did you say he told fiver to be quiet?"
     "yes, hazel. fiver came into the warren and told us about the snare, and that
poor bigwig--"
     "yes, all right. and then cowslip--?"
     "cowslip and strawberry and the others pretended not to hear. it was
ridiculous, because fiver was calling out to everybody. and then as we were
running out silver said to cowslip, 'surely you're coming?' and cowslip simply
turned his back. so then fiver went up and spoke to him very quietly, but i heard

     "i'll kill him," gasped a low, choking voice behind them. they all leaped round.
bigwig had raised his head and was supporting himself on his forepaws alone. his
body was twisted and his hind p

again and crawled forward, trailing
the wire through the grass with the broken peg snickering behind it.
     "let him alone!" cried hazel, for now they were all pressing forward to help
him. "do you want to kill him? let him rest! let him breathe!"
     "no, not rest," panted bigwig. "i'm all right." as he spoke he fell again and
immediately struggled up on his forepaws as before. "it's my back legs. won't
move. that cowslip! i'll kill him!"
     "why do we let them stay in that warren?" cried silver. "what sort of rabbits
are they? they left bigwig to die. you all heard cowslip in the burrow. they're
cowards. let's drive them out -- kill them! take the warren and live there
ourselves!"
     "yes! yes!" they all answered. "come on! back to the warren! down with
cowslip! down with silverweed! kill them!"
     "o embleer frith!" cried a squealing voice in the long grass.
     at this shocking impiety, the tumult died away. they looked about them,
wondering who could have spoken. there was sil

     "do?" replied fiver. "why, go -- now. i told cowslip we were going before i left
the burrow."
     "where?" said bigwig. but it was hazel who answered.
     "to the hills," he said.
     south of them, the ground rose gently away from the brook. along the crest
was the line of a cart track and beyond, a copse. hazel turned toward it and the
rest began to follow him up the slope in ones and twos.
     "what about the wire, bigwig?" said silver. "the peg will catch and tighten it
again."
     "no, it's loose now," said bigwig "i could shake it off if i hadn't hurt my neck."
     "try," said silver. "you won't get far otherwise."
     "hazel," said speedwell suddenly, "there's a rabbit coming down from the
warren. look!"
     "only one?" said bigwig. "what a pity! you take him, silver. i won't deprive
you. make a good job of it while you're at it."
     they stopped and waited, dotted here and there about the slope. the rabbit

     "no, he couldn't run like that with the white blindness," said hazel. "whatever
ails him, it isn't that."
     "it's strawberry!" cried dandelion.
     strawberry came through the hedge by the crab-apple tree, looked about him
and made his way to hazel. all his urbane self-possession had vanished. he was
staring and trembling and his great size seemed only to add to his air of stricken
misery. he cringed before them in the grass as hazel waited, stern and
motionless, with silver at his side.
     "hazel," said strawberry, "are you going away?"
     hazel made no answer, but silver said sharply, "what's that to you?"
     "take me with you." there was no reply and he repeated, "take me with you."
     "we don't care for creatures who deceive us," said silver. "better go back to
nildro-hain. no doubt she's less particular."
     strawberry gave a kind of choking squeal, as though he had been wounded. he
looked from silver to hazel and then to fiver. at last, in a pitiful

 whisper, he said,
     "the wires."
     silver was about to answer, but hazel spoke first.
     "you can come with us," he said. "don't say any more. poor fellow."
     a few minutes later the rabbits had crossed the cart track and vanished into
the copse beyond. a magpie, seeing some light-colored object conspicuous on the
empty slope, flew closer to look. but all that lay there was a splintered peg and a
twisted length of wire.

lay between.
     at the foot of the turf cliff, hazel and his companions were crouching under
the low branches of two or three spindle trees. since the previous morning they
had journeyed nearly three miles. their luck had been good, for everyone who
had left the warren was still alive. they had splashed through two brooks and
wandered fearfully in the deep woodlands west of ecchinswell. they had rested in
the straw of a starveall, or lonely barn, and woken to find themselves attacked by
rats. silver and buckthorn, with bigwig helping them, had covered the retreat
until, once all were together outside, they had taken to flight. buckthorn had been
bitten in the foreleg, and the wound, in the manner of a rat bite, was irritant and
painful. skirting a small lake, they had stared to see a great gray fisher bird that
stabbed and paddled in the sedge, until a flight of wild duck had frightened them
away with their clamor. they had crossed more than half a mile of open pasture
without a trace of c

re, there was not one of them who had not turned
sick at heart to think that bigwig was dead and wondered, like blackberry, what
would become of them now. without hazel, without blackberry, buckthorn and
pipkin -- bigwig would have died. without himself he would have died, for which
else, of them all, would not have stopped running after such punishment? there
was no more questioning of bigwig's strength, fiver's insight, blackberry's wits or
hazel's authority. when the rats came, buckthorn and silver had obeyed bigwig
and stood their ground. the rest had followed hazel when he roused them and,
without explanation, told them to go quickly outside the barn. later, hazel had
said that there was nothing for it but to cross the open pasture and under silver's
direction they had crossed it, with dandelion running ahead to reconnoiter.
when fiver said the iron tree was harmless they believed him.
     strawberry had had a bad time. his misery made him slow-witted and careless

ke. "so he darned well ought
to be," replied bigwig, "the great dandy" -- for by their standards strawberry was
scrupulously clean and fastidious. "well, i won't have him brow-beaten, bigwig,
mind. that won't help him." this bigwig had accepted, though rather sulkily. yet
he himself had become less overbearing. the snare had left him weak and
overwrought. it was he who had given the alarm in the barn, for he could not
sleep and at the sound of scratching had started up at once. he would not let
silver and buckthorn fight alone, but he had felt obliged to leave the worst of it to
them. for the first time in his life, bigwig had found himself driven to moderation
and prudence.
     as the sun sank lower and touched the edge of the cloud belt on the horizon,
hazel came out from under the branches and looked carefully round the lower
slope. then he stared upward over the anthills, to the open down rising above.

     "it'll mean a lot of work."
     "look, there's bigwig come up now and some of the others with him. why not
put it to them and see what they say?"
     during silflay, however, hazel mentioned blackberry's idea to no one but
fiver. later on, when most of the rabbits had finished feeding and were either
playing in the grass or lying in the sunshine, he suggested that they might go
across to the hanger -- "just to see what sort of a wood it is." bigwig and silver
agreed at once and in the end no one stayed behind.
     it was different from the meadow copses they had left: a narrow belt of trees,
four or five hundred yards long but barely fifty wide; a kind of windbreak
common on the downs. it consisted almost entirely of well-grown beeches. the
great, smooth trunks stood motionless in their green shade, the branches
spreading flat, one above another in crisp, light-dappled tiers. between the trees
the ground was open and offered hardly any cover. the r

they could not make out why the wood was so light and still and why they could
see so far between the trees. the continuous, gentle rustling of the beech leaves
was unlike the sounds to be heard in a copse of nut bushes, oak and silver birch.
     moving uncertainly in and out along the edge of the hanger, they came to the
northeast corner. here there was a bank from which they looked out over the
empty stretches of grass beyond. fiver, absurdly small beside the hulking bigwig,
turned to hazel with an air of happy confidence.
     "i'm sure blackberry's right, hazel," he said. "we ought to do our best to make
some holes here. i'm ready to try, anyway."
     the others were taken aback. pipkin, however, readily joined hazel at

 anyone had asked a question. "yes, it is holly,
and bluebell is with him -- no one else. they're in a bad way and they're not to be
troubled. we'll leave this hole empty for them. now i'm going underground
myself and so will you if you've got any sense."
     but before he went, bigwig turned to hazel and said, "you got yourself out of
that ditch down there instead of me, didn't you, hazel? i shan't forget that."
     hazel remembered buckthorn's leg and took him down with him. speedwell

and silver followed them.
     "i say, what's happened, hazel?" asked silver. "it must be something very bad.
holly would never leave the threarah."
     "i don't know," replied hazel, "and neither does anyone else yet. we'll have to
wait until tomorow. holly may stop running, but i don't think bluebell will. now
let me alone to do this leg of buckthorn's."
     the wound was a great deal better and soon hazel fell asleep.

s beginning to take shape. at the north end, the
beech roots formed a kind of irregular colonnade. this gave way to a more open
central space: and beyond, where there were no supporting roots, strawberry left
blocks of the earth untouched, so that the south end consisted of three or four
separate bays. these narrowed into low-roofed runs that led away into sleeping
burrows.
     hazel, much better pleased now that he could see for himself how the business
was going to turn out, was sitting with silver in the mouth of the run when
suddenly there was a stamping of "hawk! hawk!" and a dash for cover by the
rabbits outside. hazel, safe where he was, remained looking out past the shadow
of the wood to the open, sunlit grass beyond. the kestrel sailed into view and took
up station, the black-edged flange of its tail bent down and its pointed wings
beating rapidly as it searched the down below.
     "but do you think it would attack us?" asked hazel, watching it drop lower and
recommence its poised

 fluttering. "surely it's too small?"
     "you're probably right," replied silver. "all the same, would you care to go out
there and start feeding?"
     "i'd like to try standing up to some of these elil," said bigwig, who had come up
the run behind them. "we're afraid of too many. but a bird from the air would be
awkward, especially if it came fast. it might get the better of even a big rabbit if it
took him by surprise."
     "see the mouse?" said silver suddenly. "there, look. poor little beast."
     they could all see the field mouse, which was exposed in a patch of smooth
grass. it had evidently strayed too far from its hole and now could not tell what to
do. the kestrel's shadow had not passed over it, but the rabbits' sudden
disappearance had made it uneasy and it was pressed to the ground, looking
uncertainly this way and that. the kestrel had not yet seen it, but could hardly fail
to do so as soon as it moved.
     "any moment now," sai

rom the mouth of the hole, the mouse had
dashed between his front paws and was pressed to the ground between his back
legs. at the same moment the kestrel, all beak and talons, hit the loose earth
immediately outside like a missile thrown from the tree above. it scuffled
savagely and for an instant the three rabbits saw its round, dark eyes looking

straight down the run. then it was gone. the speed and force of the pounce, not a
length away, were terrifying and hazel leaped backward, knocking silver off his
balance. they picked themselves up in silence.
     "like to try standing up to that one?" said silver, looking round at bigwig. "let
me know when. i"ll come and watch."
     "hazel," said bigwig, "i know you're not stupid, but what did we get out of
that? are you going in for protecting every mole and shrew that can't get
underground?"
     the mouse had not moved. it was still crouching a little inside the run, on a
level with their heads and outlined against the light. hazel could se

day. holly's been more or less himself since he woke up this afternoon, and he's
been up to silflay. he asked where you and the others would be tonight and, as i
didn't know, i came to ask."
     "is he fit to talk to us, then?" asked bigwig.
     "i think so. it would be the best thing for him, if i'm any judge: and if he was
with all of us together he'd be less likely to have another bad night."
     "well, where are we going to sleep?" said silver.
     hazel considered. the honeycomb was still rough-dug and half finished, but it
would probably be as comfortable as the holes under the thorn trees. besides, if it
proved otherwise, they would have all the more inducement to improve it. to
know that they were actually making use of their day's hard work would please
everybody and they were likely to prefer this to a third night in the chalk holes.
     "i should think here," he said. "but we'll see how the others feel."

     "i can manage it," said holly. "but i must warn you that it will strike the frost
into the heart of every rabbit that hears it."
     he himself looked so sad and dark as he spoke that no one made any reply, and
after a few moments all six rabbits made their way up the slope in silence. when
they reached the corner of the wood, they found the others feeding or basking in
the evening sun on the north side of the beech trees. after a glance round among
them holly went up to silver, who was feeding with fiver in a patch of yellow
trefoil.
     "i'm glad to see you here, silver," he said. "i hear you've had a rough time."
     "it hasn't been easy," answered silver. "hazel's done wonders and we owe a lot
to fiver here as well."
     "i've heard of you," said holly, turning to fiver. "you're the rabbit who saw it
all coming. you talked to the threarah, didn't you?"
     "he talked to me," said fiver.

i mean. he's your chief rabbit now, that's plain. i hardly know him, but he must
be good or you'd all be dead; and this is no time to be squabbling. if any of the
other rabbits are wondering whether i might want to alter things, will you let
them know that i shan't?"
     "yes, i will," said silver.
     bigwig came up. "i know it's not owl time yet," he said, "but everyone's so

eager to hear you, holly, that they want to go underground at once. will that suit
you?"
     "underground?" replied holly. "but how can you all hear me underground? i
was expecting to talk here."
     "come and see," said bigwig.
     holly and bluebell were impressed by the honeycomb.

them for some time, thumping about and talking. i kept thinking, 'well, they've

     "what did the threarah say?" asked silver.
     "i've no idea. i didn't ask him and neither did anyone else, as far as i know. i
went to sleep and when i woke there was no sound up above. it was evening and i

     holly stopped and pressed his nose under bigwig's flank.
     "well, never mind about that bit," said hazel in a steady voice. "tell us how
you came away."
     "before that happened," said holly, "a great hrududu came into the field from
the lane. it wasn't the one the men came in. it was very noisy and it was yellow --
as yellow as charlock: and in front there was a great silver, shining thing that it
held in its huge front paws. i don't know how to describe it to you. it looked like
inl√©, but it was broad and not so bright. and this thing -- how can i tell you -- it
tore the field to bits. it destroyed the field."
     he stopped again.

surely that's not quite what you mean?"

that he did, he realized that terror and fatigue had probably not been the
principal causes of holly's collapse. he was badly wounded -- worse than
buckthorn. he must have lost a lot of blood. his ear was in ribbons and there was
any amount of dirt in it. hazel felt annoyed with dandelion. as several of the
rabbits began to silflay, attracted by the mild june night and the full moon, he
asked blackberry to wait. silver, who had been about to leave by the other run,
returned and joined them.
     "dandelion and the other two seem to have cheered you up, all right," said
hazel to holly. "it's a pity they didn't clean you up as well. that dirt's dangerous."
     "well, you see--" began bluebell, who had remained beside holly.
     "don't make a joke," said hazel. "you seem to think--"
     "i wasn't going to," said bluebell. "i was only going to say that i wanted to
clean the captain's ear, but it's too tender t

o be touched."
     "he's quite right," said holly. "i'm afraid i made them neglect it, but do as you
think best, hazel, i'm feeling much better now."
     hazel began on the ear himself. the blood had caked black and the task needed
patience. after a while the long, jagged wounds bled again as they slowly became
clean. silver took over. holly, bearing it as well as he could, growled and scuffled,
and silver cast about for something to occupy his attention.
     "hazel," he asked, "what was this idea you had -- about the mouse? you said
you'd explain it later. how about trying it out on us now?"
     "well," said hazel, "the idea is simply that in our situation we can't afford to
waste anything that might do us good. we're in a strange place we don't know
much about and we need friends. now, elil can't do us good, obviously, but there
are many creatures that aren't elil -- birds, mice, yonil and so

usually have much to do with them, but their enemies are our enemies, for the
most part. i think we ought to do all we can to make these creatures friendly. it
might turn out to be well worth the trouble."
     "i can't say i fancy the idea myself," said silver, wiping holly's blood out of his
nose. "these small animals are more to be despised than relied upon, i reckon.
what good can they do us? they can't dig for us, they can't get food for us, they
can't fight for us. they'd say they were friendly, no doubt, as long as we were
helping them; but that's where it would stop. i heard that mouse tonight -- 'you
want 'im, 'e come.' you bet he will, as long as there's any grub or warmth going,
but surely we're not going to have the warren overrun with mic

s need to know."
     "well, i admit a mouse might or might not come in handy," said hazel. "but
i'm sure a bird would, if we could only do enough for it. we can't fly, but some of

them know the country for a long way round. they know a lot about the weather,
too. all i'm saying is this. if anyone finds an animal or bird, that isn't an enemy,
in need of help, for goodness' sake don't miss the opportunity. that would be like
leaving carrots to rot in the ground."
     "what do you think?" said silver to blackberry.
     "i think it's a good idea, but real opportunities of the kind hazel has in mind
aren't likely to come very often."
     "i think that's about right," said holly, wincing as silver resumed licking. "the
idea's all right as far as it goes, but it won't come to a great deal in practice."
     "i'm ready to give it a try," said silver. "i reckon it'll be worth it, just to see
bigwig telling bedtime stories to a mole."

again.
     as the rabbits came up by the hole inside the beech wood, a swift gust of wind

passed through the leaves, checkering and dappling the ground beneath, stealing
and giving light under the branches. they listened, but beyond the rustle of the
leaves there came from the open down outside no sound except the monotonous
tremolo of a grasshopper warbler, far off in the grass.
     "what a moon!" said silver. "let's enjoy it while it's here."
     as they went over the bank they met speedwell and hawkbit returning.
     "oh, hazel," said hawkbit, "we've been talking to another mouse. he'd heard
about the kestrel this evening and was very friendly. he told us about a place just
the other side of the wood where the grass has been cut short -- something to do
with horses, he said. 'you like a nice a grass? 'e very fine grass.' so we went there.

     the gallop turned out to be a good

ing snow about to slide from a sloping roof. then the whole down and
all below it, earth and air, gave way to the sunrise. as a bull, with a slight but
irresistible movement, tosses its head from the grasp of a man who is leaning over
the stall and idly holding its horn, so the sun entered the world in smooth,
gigantic power. nothing interrupted or obscured its coming. without a sound, the
leaves shone and the grass coruscated along the miles of the escarpment.
     outside the wood, bigwig and silver combed their ears, sniffed the air and
hopped away, following their own long shadows to the grass of the gallop. as they
moved over the short turf -- nibbling, sitting up and looking round them -- they
approached a little hollow, no more than three feet across. before they reached
the edge bigwig, who was ahead of silver, checked and crouched, staring.
although he could not see into the hollow, he knew that there was some creature
in it -- something fairly big. peering through the blades of gra

ss round his head,
he could see the curve of a white back. whatever the creature was, it was nearly as
big as himself. he waited, stock still, for some little time, but it did not move.
     "what has a white back, silver?" whispered bigwig.
     silver considered. "a cat?"
     "no cats here."
     "how do you know?"
     at that moment they both heard a low, breathy hissing from the hollow. it
lasted for a few moments. then there was silence once more.
     bigwig and silver had a good opinion of themselves. apart from holly, they
were the only survivors of the sandleford owsla and they knew that their
comrades looked up to them. the encounter with the rats in the barn had been no
joke and had proved their worth. bigwig, who was generous and honest, had
never for a moment resented hazel's courage on the night when his own
superstitious fear had got the better of him. but the idea of going back to the
honeycomb and reporting that he had glimpsed an unknown creature

in the
grass and left it alone was more than he could swallow. he turned his head and
looked at silver. seeing that he was game, he took a final look at the strange white
back and then went straight up to the edge of the hollow. silver followed.
     it was no cat. the creature in the hollow was a bird -- a big bird, nearly a foot

long. neither of them had ever seen a bird like it before. the white part of its
back, which they had glimpsed through the grass, was in fact only the shoulders
and neck. the lower back was light gray and so were the wings, which tapered to
long, black-tipped primaries folded together over the tail. the head was very dark
brown -- almost black -- in such sharp contrast to the white neck that the b

looked as though it were wearing a kind of hood. the one dark red leg that they
could see ended in a webbed foot and three powerful, taloned toes. the beak,
hooked slightly downward at the end, was strong and sharp. as they stared, it
opened, disclosing a red mouth and throat. the bird hissed savagely and tried to
strike, but still it did not move.
     "it's hurt," said bigwig.
     "yes, you can tell that," replied silver. "but it's not wounded anywhere that i
can see. i'll go round--"
     "look out!" said bigwig. "he'll have you!"
     silver, as he started to move round the hollow, had come closer to the bird's
head. he jumped back just in time to avoid a quick, darting blow of the beak.
     "that would have broken your foot," said bigwig.
     as they squatted, looking at the bird -- for they both sensed intuitively that it
would not rise -- it suddenly burst into loud, raucous cries -- "yark! yark!
yark!"

-- a tremendous sound at close quarters -- that split the morning and
carried far across the down. bigwig and silver turned and ran.
     they collected themselves sufficiently to pull up short of the wood and make a
more dignified approach to the bank. hazel came to meet them in the grass.
there was no mistaking their wide eyes and dilated nostrils.
     "elil?" asked hazel.
     "well, i'm blessed if i know, to tell you the truth," replied bigwig. "there's a
great bird out there, like nothing i've ever seen."
     "how big? as big as a pheasant?"
     "not quite so big," admitted bigwig, "but bigger than a

wood pigeon: and a lot
fiercer."
     "is that what cried?"
     "yes. it startled me, all right. we were actually beside it. but for some reason
or other it can't move."
     "dying?"
     "i don't think so."
     "i'll go and have a look at it," said hazel.
     "it's savage. for goodness' sake be careful."
     bigwig and silver returned with hazel. the three of them squatted outside the
bird's reach as it looked sharply and desperately from one to the other. hazel
spoke in the hedgerow patois.
     "you hurt? you no fly?"
     the answer was a harsh gabbling which they all felt immediately to be exotic.
wherever the bird came from, it was somewhere far away. the accent was strange
and guttural, the speech distorted. they could catch only a word here and there.
     "come keel -- kah! kah! -- you come keel -- yark! --

o the ground. they

noticed for the first time that the grass in front of it was torn and scored with
lines. for some moments it stabbed here and there, then gave up, lifted its head
and watched them again.
     "i believe it's starving," said hazel. "we'd better feed it. bigwig, go and get
some worms or something, there's a good fellow."
     "er -- what did you say, hazel?"
     "worms."
     "me dig for worms?"
     "didn't the owsla teach -- oh, all right, i'll do it," said hazel. "you and silver
wait here."
     after a few moments, however, bigwig followed hazel back to the ditch and
began to join him in scratching at the dry ground. worms are not plentiful on the
downs and there had been no rain for days. after a time bigwig looked up.
     "what about beetles? wood lice? something like that?"
     they found some rotten sticks and carried them back. hazel pushed one
forward cautiously.
     "insects."
     the bird split the stick three ways in as many seconds and snapped up the few

     "damn de lot. fight plenty."
     "i bet it would, too," said bigwig, looking with admiration at the two-inch beak
and thick neck.
     "we no want you finish," said hazel. "you stay here you finish. we help you
maybe."
     "piss off!"
     "come on," said hazel immediately to the others. "let it alone." he began to
lollop back to the wood. "let it try keeping the kestrels off for a bit."
     "what's the idea, hazel?" said silver. "that's a savage brute. you can't make a
friend out of that."
     "you may be right," said hazel. "but what's the good of a blue tit or a robin to
us? they don't fly any distance. we need a big bird."
     "but why do you want a bird so particularly?"
     "i'll explain later," said hazel. "i'd like blackberry and fiver to hear as well.
but let's go underground now. if you don't want to chew pellets, i do."
     during the afternoon hazel organized more work on the warren. the

spring. it was nothing much, but it held him up. he rested and hung around a
rookery for a bit. then he got stronger and left them, and he was coming along
when he stopped in the farmyard and met this foul cat."
     "so when it's better it'll go on again?" said hazel.
     "yes."
     "we've been wasting our time, then."
     "why, hazel, what is it you have in mind?"
     "go and get blackberry and fiver: we'd better have silver, too. then i'll
explain."
     the quiet of the evening silflay, when the western sun shone straight along the
ridge, the grass tussocks threw shadows twice as long as themselves and the cool
air smelled of thyme and dog roses, was something which they had all come to
enjoy even more than former evenings in the meadows of sandleford. although
they could not know it, the down was more lonely than it had been for hundreds
of years. there were no sheep, and villagers from kingsclere and sydmonton

e warren, brought in
great numbers of beetles and grasshoppers. at first the gull's principal hardship
was lack of water. he suffered a good deal and was reduced to tearing at the
stems of the long grasses for moisture. however, during his third night in the
warren it rained for three or four hours and puddles formed on the track. a
cluttery spell set in, as it often does in hampshire when haytime approaches.
high winds from the south laid the grass flat all day, turning it to a dull,
damascene silver. the great branches of the beeches moved little, but spoke
loudly. there were squalls of rain on the wind. the weather made kehaar restless.
he walked about a good deal, watched the flying clouds and snapped up
everything the foragers brought. searching became harder, for in the wet the
insects burrowed into the deep grass and had to be scratched out.
     one afternoon hazel, who now shared a burrow with fiver as in the old days,
was woken by bigwig to be told that kehaar had something to say

ered each rabbit in turn, discussing who would
be the most likely to survive the long journey, to arrive in good shape and to go
down well in a strange warren. bigwig, rejected on the grounds that he might
quarrel in strange company, was inclined to be sulky at first, but came round
when he remembered that he could go on looking after kehaar. holly himself
wanted to take bluebell but, as blackberry said, one funny joke at the expense of
the chief rabbit might ruin everything. finally they chose silver, buckthorn and
strawberry. strawberry said little, but was obviously very much pleased. he had
suffered a good deal to show that he was no coward and now he had the

satisfaction of knowing that he was worth something to his new friends.
     they started early in the morning, in the gray light. kehaar had undertaken to
fly out later in the day, to make sure they were going in the right direction and
bring back news of their progress. hazel and bigwig went with them to the
southern end of the

seemed likely to regard the neighborhood of the hanger with healthy respect for
the future. things had not looked better since they had first set out from
sandleford.
     a spirit of happy mischief entered into hazel. he felt as he had on the morning
when they crossed the enborne and he had set out alone and found the beanfield.
he was confident and ready for adventure. but what adventure? something worth
telling to holly and silver on their return. something to -- well, not to diminish
what they were going to do. no, of course not -- but just to show them that their
chief rabbit was up to anything that they were up to. he thought it over as he
hopped down the bank and sniffed out a patch of salad burnet in the grass. what,

now, would be likely to give them just a little, not unpleasant shock? suddenly he
thought, "suppose, when they got back, that there were one or two does here
already?" and in the same moment he remem

up the hill and at once called everyone to meet in the honeycomb. fiver did not
appear.
     it was a dismal welcome for the strangers. not even bluebell could find a
cheerful word. dandelion was inconsolable to think that he might have stopped
hazel breaking from the ditch. the meeting came to an end in a dreary silence
and a half-hearted silflay.
     later that morning holly came limping into the warren. of his three
companions, only silver was alert and unharmed. buckthorn was wounded in the
face and strawberry was shivering and evidently ill from exhaustion. there were
no other rabbits with them.

look for them while there was still light? but if kehaar found them, what then?
they could not be compelled to return. or if they were, what good would that do,
if they wanted to be gone? at that moment holly began to speak and everyone
became quiet.
     "we all know we're in a mess," said holly, "and i suppose before long we shall
have to talk about what's best to be done. but i thought that first of all i ought to
tell you how it is that we four -- silver, buckthorn, strawberry and i -- have come
back without any does. you don't have to remind me that when we set out,
everyone thought it was going to be straightforward. and here we are, one rabbit
sick, one wounded and nothing to show for it. you're all wondering why."
     "no one's blaming you, holly," said bigwig.
     "i don't know whether i'm to blame or not," replied holly. "but you'll tell me
that when you've heard the story.

used to know -- meadows and woods -- but we didn't. anyhow, we found a track
with a good, thick hedge along one side and we decided to follow that. we took it
easy and stopped a good deal, because i was taking care to avoid running into elil.
i'm sure it's bad country for stoats as well as foxes, and i hadn't much idea what
we were going to do if we met one."
     "i'm pretty certain we did pass close to a weasel," said silver. "i could smell it.
but you know how it is with elil -- if they're not actually hunting, they often take
no notice of you. we left very little scent, and buried our hraka as though we were
cats."
     "well, before ni-frith," went on holly, "the track brought us to a long, thin
wood running right across the way we were going. these downland woods are
queer, aren't they? this was no thicker than the one above us now, but it
stretched as far as we could see either way, in a dead straight line. i

and rather harassed by having more to do than he could really cope with.
     "that night, when we were called to silflay, it was pitch dark and raining; but
you don't bother about a little thing like that in efrafa -- you're only too glad to
get out and get some food. all the rabbits trooped up; and we waited until the
very last. captain bugloss was out on the bank, with two of his sentries. silver
and the others went out in front of me and then i came up to him panting as if i'd
been running.
     "'captain bugloss?'
     "'yes?' he said. 'what is it?'

direction. you know how you always do. the rain had stopped and we set out. but
it was a very hard journey back. we were exhausted long before the end -- all
except silver: i don't know what we'd have done without him. we went on for a
day and a night without any real rest at all. we all felt that the only thing we
wanted to do was to get back here as soon as we could. when i reached the wood

     "our bodies stay here -- that's good enough for me. you'd better go and talk to

with fiver."

holly, will you tell them that fiver and i will come early tomorrow morning? it
worries me to think that bigwig and silver may start fighting about clover at any
moment."
     "hazel," said holly, "listen. i don't like this idea of yours at all. i've been in
efrafa and you haven't. you're making a bad mistake and you might very well get
us all killed."
     it was fiver who replied. "it ought to feel like that, i know," he said, "but
somehow it doesn't: not to me. i believe we can do it. anyway, i'm sure hazel's
right when he says it's the only chance we've got. suppose we go on talking about

     "and if that happens, i shan't ignore it," said hazel.
     there was silence. then bigwig spoke.
     "you may as well all know that i'm going," he said, "and we shall have kehaar
with us, if that appeals to you at all."
     there was a buzz of surprise.
     "of course, there are some of us who ought to stay here," said hazel. "the farm
rabbits can't be expected to go; and i'm not asking anyone who went the first time
to go back again."
     "i'll come, though," said silver. "i hate general woundwort and his council
with all my guts and if we're really going to make fools of them i want to be there,
as long as i don't have to go back inside the place -- that i couldn't face. but, after
all, you're going to need someone who knows the way."
     "i'll come," said pipkin. "hazel-rah saved my -- i mean, i'm sure he knows
what's--" he became confused. "anyway, i'll come," he repeated, in a very
nervous voice.
     there was a scuffling in the run that led down from the

nyone who wished could
remain at home and welcome -- implying that if he was so poor-spirited as to
choose to miss the exploit, they could do without him. holly, in whom loyalty was
second nature, had said no more to queer the pitch. he accompanied them as far
as the end of the wood with all the cheerfulness he could muster; only begging
hazel, out of hearing of the rest, not to underrate the danger. "send news by
kehaar when he reaches you," he said, "and come back soon."
     nevertheless, as silver guided them southward along higher ground to the
west of the farm, almost all, now that they were actually committed to the
adventure, felt dread and apprehension. they had heard enough about efrafa to
daunt the stoutest heart. but before reaching it -- or wherever they were going --
they had to expect two days on the open down. foxes, stoats, weasels -- any of
these might be encountered, and the only recourse would be flight above ground.

hat which holly had made
with his picked band of three. rabbits strayed, took alarm, stopped to rest. after a
time hazel divided them into groups, led by silver, bigwig and himself. yet still
they moved slowly, like climbers on a rock face, first some and then others taking
their turn to cross the same piece of ground.
     but at least the cover was good. june was moving toward july and high
summer. hedgerows and verges were at their rankest and thickest. the rabbits
sheltered in dim green sun-flecked caves of grass, flowering marjoram and cow
parsley; peered round spotted hairy-stemmed clumps of viper's bugloss,
blooming red and blue above their head

ld hardly have hoped to go far unobserved by enemies. but the sheep were
long gone and the tractors had plowed great expanses for wheat and barley. the
smell of the green, standing corn was round them all day. the mice were
numerous and so were the kestrels. the kestrels were disturbing, but hazel had
been right when he guessed that a healthy, full-grown rabbit was too large a
quarry for them. at all events, no one was attacked from above.
     some time before ni-frith, in the heat of the day, silver paused in a little patch
of thorn. there was no breeze and the air was full of the sweet, chrysanthemum-
like smell of the flowering compositae of dry uplands -- corn chamomile, yarrow
and tansy. as hazel and fiver came up and squatted beside him, he looked out
across the open ground ahead.
     "there, hazel-rah," he said, "that's the wood that holly didn't like."

." bigwig had gone
moodily down the hedgerow to collect his group.
     now he came out of a nearby clump of mugwort and flowering thistle and
joined hazel under the thorn.
     "what do you want?" he asked abruptly.
     "king of cats" (pfeffa-rah), answered hazel, "would you like to go and have a
look in those trees? and if you find any cats or men or anything like that, just
chase them off, would you, and then come and tell us it's all right?"
     when bigwig had slipped away, hazel said to silver, "have you any idea how
far the wide patrols go out? are we inside their range yet?"
     "i don't know, but i'd guess that we are," said silver. "as i understand it, the
range is up to the patrol. under a pushing sort of captain, a patrol may go out a
long way, i believe."
     "i see," said hazel. "well, i don't want to meet a patrol if it can possibly be
helped, and if we do, not one of them must get back to efrafa. that's one reason
why i brought so many of us. but by way of avoiding them,

     "but surely it doesn't run the way we want to go?" said silver.

somewhere to hide, as near to it as we can safely get. any ideas?"
     "only that it's terribly dangerous, hazel-rah," said silver. "you can't get near
efrafa safely and i don't know how you can begin to look for somewhere to hide.
and then the patrol -- if there is one -- they'll be cunning brutes. they might very
well spot us and not show themselves at all -- simply go and report."
     "well, here comes bigwig back again," said hazel. "is it all right, bigwig? good
-- let's get them into the wood and go down the length of it a little way. then we
must slip out on the other side and make sure that kehaar finds us. he's c

questions about the plan, he began to wonder how he could distract their
thoughts and get them to relax until they were ready to set off again. he
remembered the time, on the first night of his leadership, when they had been
forced to rest in the wood above the enborne. at least it was good to see that no
one was exhausted now: they were as tough a bunch of hlessil as ever raided a
garden. not a blade of grass to choose between them, thought hazel: pipkin and
fiver looked as fresh as silver and bigwig. still, a little entertainment would be all
to the good and raise their spirits. he was just going to speak up when acorn
saved him the trouble.
     "will you tell us a story, dandelion?" he asked.
     "yes! yes!" said several others. "come on! make it a stunner while you're at it!"
     "all right," said dandelion. "how about 'el-ahrairah and the fox in the
water'?"
     "let's have 'the hole in the sky,'" said hawkbit.
     "no, not that," said bigwig suddenly. he had spoken very

e south side of the combe when suddenly a
rabbit shouldered him roughly aside, pushed past fiver and was gone into the
open. hazel stopped and looked round in amazement.
     "who was that?" he asked.
     "bigwig," answered fiver, staring.
     together they went quickly back to the briars and once more looked into the
combe. bigwig, in full view, was loping warily downhill, straight toward the fox.
they watched him, aghast. he drew near, but still the fox paid no attention.
     "hazel," said silver from behind, "shall i--?"
     "no one is to move," said hazel quickly. "keep still, all of you."
     at about thirty yards' distance the fox saw the approaching rabbit. it paused
for a moment and then continued to trot forward. it was almost upon him before
bigwig turned and began to limp up the north slope of the combe toward the trees
of the belt. the fox hesitated again and then followed him.
     "what's he up to?" muttered blackberry.

 pace and was now some distance away from them. it
appeared to be overtaking bigwig. the sun had set and in the failing light they
could just make him out as he entered the undergrowth. he disappeared and the

fox followed. for several moments all was quiet. then, horribly clear across the
darkening, empty combe, there came the agonizing squeal of a stricken rabbit.
     "o frith and inl√©!" cried blackberry, stamping. pipkin turned to bolt. hazel did
not move.
     "shall we go, hazel?" asked silver. "we can't help him now."
     as he spoke, bigwig suddenly broke out of the trees, running very fast. almost
before they could grasp that he was alive, he had recrossed the entire upper slope
of the combe in a single dash and bolted in among them.
     "come on," said bigwig, "let's get out of here!"
     "but what -- what -- are you wounded?" asked bluebell in bewilderment.
     "no," said bigwig, "never better! let's go!"
     "you can wait until i'm ready," said hazel in a cold, angry tone.

     "so the homba got this other rabbit?"
     "it must have. after all, i led it right onto them, even though i didn't mean to.
but i never saw what actually happened."
     "what became of the others?"
     "i've no idea. they must have run, i suppose."
     "i see," said hazel thoughtfully. "well, perhaps it's all for the best. but look
here, bigwig, no more fancy tricks until the proper time -- there's too much at
stake. you'd better stay near silver and me -- we'll keep you in good heart."
     at that moment silver came up to them.
     "hazel," he said, "i've just realized where we are and it's a lot too close to
efrafa. i think we ought to make off as soon as we can."
     "i want to go right round efrafa -- wide," said hazel. "do you think you can
find the way to that iron road holly told us about?"
     "i think so," replied silver. "but we can't make too big a circle or they'll be
completely exhausted. i can't say i know the way, but

ithout menace, which died gradually away as they pushed on.
and once they heard a corncrake calling as it crept among the long grass of a path
verge. (it makes a sound like a human fingernail drawn down the teeth of a
comb.) but elil they met none and although they were continually on the watch
for signs of an efrafan patrol, they saw nothing but mice, and a few hedgehogs
hunting for slugs along the ditches.
     at last, as the first lark rose toward the light that was still far up in the sky,
silver, his pale fur sodden dark with dew, came limping back to where hazel was
encouraging bluebell and pipkin.
     "you can pluck up your spirits, bluebell," he said. "i think we're close to the
iron road."

     "i wouldn't care about my spirits," said bluebell, "if my legs weren't so tired.
slugs are lucky not to have legs. i think i'll be a slug."
     "well, i'm a hedgehog," said hazel, "so you'd better get on!"
     "you're not," replied bluebell. "you haven't enough fleas. now, slugs don't

ave fleas, either. how comforting to be a slug, among the dandelions so snug--"
     "and feel the blackbird's sudden tug," said hazel. "all right, silver, we're
coming. but where is the iron road? holly said a steep, overgrown bank. i can't
make out anything like that."
     "no, that's away up by efrafa. down here it runs in a sort of combe of its own.
can't you smell it?"
     hazel sniffed. in the cool damp, he picked up at once the unnatural smells of
metal, coal smoke and oil. they went forward and in a very short time found
themselves looking down from among the bushes and undergrowth on the edge
of the railway cutting. all was quiet, but

ed too much for the muscle torn
by the shotgun pellets. he wondered whether it was far to the river of which
kehaar had spoken. if it was, he was in for trouble.
     "hazel-rah," said pipkin, coming up from among the soapwort, "are you all
right? your leg looks queer -- you're dragging it."
     "no, it's all right," said hazel. "look, hlao-roo, where's kehaar? i want to talk
to him."
     "he's flown out to see if there's a patrol anywhere near, hazel-rah. bigwig
woke some time ago and he and silver asked kehaar to go. they didn't want to
disturb you."
     hazel felt irritated. it would have been better to be told at once which way to

go, rather than to wait while kehaar looked for patrols. they were going to cross a
river and, as far as he was concerned, they could not do it too soon. fretting, he
waited for kehaar. soon he had become as tense and nervous as he had ever been
in his life. he was beginning to believe that after all he might have been rash. it
was clear that holly had not

 underrated their danger near efrafa. he had little
doubt that bigwig, by sheer chance, had led the fox onto a wide patrol which had
been following their trail. then, in the morning, again by luck and the help of
kehaar, they had evidently just missed another at the crossing of the iron road.
perhaps silver's fear was well founded and a patrol had already spotted and
reported them without their knowing? had general woundwort got some sort of
kehaar of his own? perhaps a bat was at this moment talking to him? how was
one to foresee and guard against everything? the grass seemed sour, the sunshine
chilly. hazel sat hunched under the firs, worrying dismally. he felt less annoyed,
now, with bigwig: he could understand his feelings. waiting was bad. he fidgeted
for some kind of action. just as he had d

come on, let's get across. what would you do if a hrududu came?"
     "run," said fiver simply, "like this." and he scurried off the further end of the
bridge into the grass beyond.
     on this far side of the river, undergrowth and a grove of great horse chestnuts
extended almost down to the bridge. the ground was marshy, but at least there
was plenty of cover. fiver and pipkin began at once on some scrapes, while hazel
sat chewing pellets and resting his injured leg. soon they were joined by silver
and dandelion, but the other rabbits, more hesitant even than hazel, remained
crouching in the long grass on the right bank. at last, just before darkness fell,
fiver re-crossed the bridge and coaxed them to follow him back. bigwig, to
everyone's surprise, showed considerable reluctance, and only crossed in the end
after kehaar, returning from another flight over efrafa, had asked whether he
would like him to go and fetch a fox.

hazel, still conscious of being in man country, was half expecting either a dog or a
cat. but although they heard owls more than once, no elil attacked them and by
the morning they were in better spirits.
     as soon as they had fed, hazel set them to exploring the surroundings. it
became even more plain that the ground near the river was too wet for rabbits.
indeed, in places it was almost bog. marsh sedge grew there, pink, sweet-scented
valerian and the drooping water avens. silver reported that it was drier up in the
woodland away from the bank, and at first hazel had the idea of picking a fresh
spot and digging again. but presently the day grew so hot and humid that all
activity was quenched. the faint breeze vanished. the sun drew up a torpid
moisture from the watery thickets. the smell of water mint filled all the
hydrophanic air. the rabbits crept into the shade, under any cover that offered.
long before ni-frith, all were drowsing in the undergrowth.

everything in this river goes along, and fast, too -- see there." he looked out at a
piece of stick floating down on the even two-mile-an-hour current. "so what's
stopping this thing from going?"
     kehaar had a short-way-with-landlubbers manner which he sometimes used to
those of the rabbits that he did not particularly like. blackberry was not one of his

favorites: he preferred straightforward characters such as bigwig, buckthorn and
silver.

     "yes, i see," said fiver. "the rope goes round that metal thing where hazel's
sitting: and the other end's fixed on the bank here. it's like the stalk of a big leaf.
you could gnaw it through and the leaf -- the boat -- would drop off the bank."
     "well, anyway, let's go back now," said hazel, rather dejectedly. "i'm afraid we
don't seem to be any nearer to finding what we're looking for, kehaar. can you

there like that. general woundwort indeed! a gun's too good for him."
     nibbling and pondering, he moved slowly over the open meadow in the
evening sun. after a while he found that he was approaching a small hollow,
much like the one on watership down where he and silver had found kehaar. in
this hollow there were four does, with their backs to him. he recognized them as
the little group who had gone out last. they had evidently finished the hungry,
intent stage of feeding and were browsing and talking at leisure, and he could see
that one of them had the attention of the other three. even more than most
rabbits, bigwig loved a story and now he felt attracted by the prospect of hearing
something new in this strange warren. he moved quietly up to the edge of the

hollow just as the doe began to speak.
     at once he realized that this was no story. yet he had heard the like before,
somewhere. the rapt air, the rhythmic utterance, the intent listeners -- what was
it they recalled? then he remembered the smell of carrots, and silverweed
dominating the crowd in the great burrow. but these verses went to his heart as

silverweed's had not.

     long ago
     the yellowhammer sang, high on the thorn.
     he sang near a litter that the doe brought out to play,
     he sang in the wind and the kittens played below.
     their time slipped by all under the elder bloom.
     but the bird flew away and now my heart is dark
     and time will never play in the fields again.

     "hazel," said fiver. "hazel-rah, you won't help him by staying here in the dark
and worrying. quite likely there's nothing wrong. he's just had to sit tight for
some reason. anyway, he won't come tonight -- that's certain now -- and our
rabbits are in danger here. kehaar can go up tomorrow at dawn and bring us
another message."
     "i dare say you're right," said hazel, "but i hate to go. just suppose he were to
come. let silver take them back and i'll stay here."
     "you couldn't do any good by yourself, hazel, even if your leg was all right.
you're trying to eat grass that isn't there. why don't you give it a chance to grow?"
     they returned under the arch and as silver came out of the bushes to meet
them, they could hear the other rabbits stirring uneasily among the nettles.

back over the river now, before it's completely dark."

 clearly. he could certainly succeed in getting out with a
couple of resolute, sensible does. but the sentry -- unless he could kill him --
would raise the alarm at once and he could not be sure of finding the way to the
river in the dark. even if he did, it was possible that the pursuit might follow him
over the plank bridge and into the middle of his unprepared, sleeping friends.
and at the best he would have come out of efrafa with no more than a couple of
does, because his nerve had failed. silver and the others would not know what he
had had to endure. they would know only that he had run away.
     "no, we mustn't give up yet," he said, as gently as he could. "it's the thunder
and the waiting that make you feel so much upset. listen, i promise you that by
this time tomorrow you'll be out of efrafa forever and the others with you. now

uld be no true sunset. on the green path by the riverbank, hazel sat fidgeting
as he tried to imagine what might be going on in efrafa.
     "he told you he wanted you to attack the sentries while the rabbits were
feeding, didn't he," he said to kehaar, "and that he'd bring the mothers out in the
confusion?"
     "ya, say dis, but not 'appen. den 'e say go away, come again tonight."
     "so that's still what he means to do. the question is, when will they be
feeding? it's getting dark already. silver, what do you think?"
     "if i know them, they won't alter anything they usually do," said silver. "but if
you're worried in case we're not there in time, why not go now?"
     "because they're always patrolling. the longer we wait up there, the greater the
risk. if a patrol finds us before bigwig comes, it won't be just a matter of getting
ourselves away. they'll realize we're there for some purpose and give the alarm,
and that'll be the end of any chance he's got."
     "listen, hazel-rah,"

y don't you take them all over
the river now and wait in the undergrowth, near the boat? once kehaar's attacked
the sentries, he can fly back and tell us."
     "yes, that's it," answered hazel. "but once he's told us, we must get up there in
no time at all. bigwig's going to need us as well as kehaar."
     "well, you won't be able to dash up to the arch," said fiver, "with your leg. the
best thing you can do is to get on the boat and have the rope gnawed half through
by the time we come back. silver can look after the fighting, if there's going to be
any."
     hazel hesitated. "but some of us are probably going to get hurt. i can't stay
behind."
     "fiver's right," said blackberry. "you will have to wait on the boat, hazel. we
can't risk your being left to be picked up by the efrafans. besides, it's very
important that the rope should be half gnawed -- that's a job for someone
sensible. it mustn't break too soon or we're all finished."
     it took them some time to persuade hazel. when

he left bank, the wind began to blow in fitful, warm gusts,
with a multifoliate rustling through the sedges. they had just reached the plank
bridge when there came a rumble of thunder. in the intense, strange light, the
plants and leaves seemed magnified and the fields beyond the river very near.
there was an oppressive stillness.
     "you know, hazel-rah," said bluebell, "this really is the funniest evening i've

ever gone looking for a doe."
     "it's going to get a lot funnier soon," said silver. "there'll be lightning and
pouring rain. for goodness' sake, all of you, don't panic, or we'll never see our
warren again. i think this is going to be a rough business," he added quietly to
hazel. "i don't like it much."

     bigwig woke to hear his name repeated urgently.

onger seemed connected by anything except his own
dazed senses. he heard kehaar screaming as he dived again to attack vervain. he
felt the rain pouring cold into the open gash in his shoulder. through the curtain
of rain he glimpsed woundwort dodging among his officers and urging them back
into the ditch on the edge of the field. he saw blackavar striking at campion and
campion turning to run. then someone beside him was saying, "hullo, bigwig.
bigwig! bigwig! what do you want us to do?" it was silver.
     "where's hazel?" he said.
     "waiting at the boat. i say, you're wounded! what--"
     "then get these does down there," said bigwig.
     all was confusion. in ones and twos the does, utterly bemused and scarcely
able to move or to understand what was said to them, were urged into getting up
and stumbling their way down the field. other rabbits began to appear through
the rain: acorn, clearly frightened, but determined not to run; dandelion
encouraging pipkin; speedwell and hawkbit mak

ing toward kehaar -- the only
creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made them understand that they were to help to get the
does away.
     "go back to blackberry, go back to blackberry," silver kept repeating. "i left
three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then bluebell, then fiver -- he's quite near the river."
     "and there is blackberry," said bigwig.
     "you did it, then, bigwig," said blackberry, shivering. "was it very bad? good
heavens, your shoulder--"
     "it's not finished yet," said bigwig. "has everyone passed you?"
     "you're the last," said blackberry. "can we go? this storm's terrifying me!"

     "they'll never give up," said bigwig. "i warn you, silver, they'll be at us before
it's done. there's thick cover in the water meadow -- they'll use that. acorn, come
back, keep away from that ditch!"
     "go back to bluebell! go back to bluebell!" repeated silver, running from side
to side.
     they found bluebell by the hedge at the bottom of the field. he was white-eyed
and ready to bolt.
     "silver," he said, "i saw a bunch of rabbits -- strangers, efrafans, i suppose --
come out of the ditch over there and slip across into the water meadow. they're
behind us now. one of them was the biggest rabbit i've ever seen."

with the surface and about eight inches above it. just in time hazel saw what
kehaar meant. if the punt did pass under the bridge without sticking, it would do

so by no more than a claw's breadth. any creature above the level of the sides
would be struck and perhaps knocked into the river. he scuttered through the
warm bilgewater to the other end and pushed his way up among the wet, crowded
rabbits.
     "get down in the bottom! get down in the bottom!" he said. "silver, hawkbit --
all of you. never mind the water. you, and you -- what's your name? oh,
blackavar, is it? -- get everyone into the bottom. be quick."
     like bigwig, he found that the efrafan rabbits obeyed him at once. he saw
kehaar fly up from his perch and disappear over the wooden rails. the concrete
abutments projected from each bank, so that the narrowed river ran slightly
faster under the bridge. the punt had been drifting broadside on, but now one
end swung forward, so that hazel lost his

. he turned and looked upward. the brickwork was sheer, with a
projecting course half way between him and the parapet. there was no
scrambling up that.
     "what's to be done, blackberry?" he asked, making his way to the bolt fixed on
the bow, with its ragged remnant of painter. "you got us on this thing. how do we
get off?"
     "i don't know, hazel-rah," replied blackberry. "of all the ways we could finish
up, i never thought of this. it looks as though we'll have to swim."
     "swim?" said silver. "i don't fancy it, hazel-rah. i know it's no distance, but
look at those banks. the current would take us down before we could get out: and
that means into one of these holes under the bridge."
     hazel tried to look through the arch. there was very little to be seen. the dark
tunnel was not long -- perhaps not much longer than the punt itself. the water
looked smooth. there seemed to be no obstructions and there was room for the
head of a swimming animal between the surface of the water and

o see exactly what lay
on the other side of the bridge. the light was failing. water, green leaves, moving
reflections of leaves, the splashing of the raindrops and some curious thing that
appeared to be standing in the water and to be made of vertical gray lines -- these
were all that could be made out. the rain echoed dismally up the culvert. the
hard, ringing noise from under the soffit, so much unlike any sound to be heard
in an earth tunnel, was disturbing. hazel returned to blackberry and silver.
     "this is as bad a fix as we've been in," he said. "we can't stay here, but i can't
see any way out."
     kehaar appeared on the parapet above them, flapped the rain out of his wings
and dropped down to the punt.
     "ees finish poat," he said. "not vait more."
     "but how can we get to the bank, kehaar?" said hazel.
     the gull was surprised. "dog sveem, rat sveem. you no sveem?"

us, kehaar. we wo

if he were a rabbit? that there was slack water immediately below the bridge,
with a low, shelving bank where they could get out easily? that seemed too much
to hope for. or did he simply mean that they had better hurry up and take a
chance on being able to do what he himself could do without difficulty? this
seemed more likely. suppose one of them did jump out of the boat and go down
with the current -- what would that tell the others, if he did not come back?
     poor hazel looked about him. silver was licking bigwig's wounded shoulder.
blackberry was fidgeting on and off the thwart, strung up, able to feel only too
clearly all that hazel felt himself. as he still hesitated, kehaar let out a squawk.
     "yark! damn rabbits no goot. vat i do, i show you."
     he tumbled clumsily off the raised bow. there was no gap between the punt
and the dark mouth of the culvert. sitting low in the water like a mallard, he
floated into the tunnel and vanished. peering after him, hazel could at first s

track was empty and there was nothing to be heard or smelled. they crossed it
and reached the end of the bridge on the upstream side. here the bank dropped
almost sheer to the river, some six feet below. blackavar scrambled down without
hesitation, but hazel followed more slowly. just above the bridge, between it and
a thorn bush upstream, was a ledge of turf which overhung the water. out in the
river, a few feet away, the punt lay against the weedy piers.
     "silver!" said hazel. "fiver! come on, get them into the water. it's all right
below the bridge. get the does in first, if you can. there's no time to lose. the
men may come back."
     it was no easy matter to rouse the torpid, bewildered does and make them
understand what they had to do. silver went from one to another. dandelion, as
soon as he saw hazel on the bank, went at once to the bow and plunged in.
speedwell followed, but as fiver was about to go silver stopped him.
     "if all our bucks go,

 hazel," he said, "the does will be left alone and i don't
think they'll manage it."
     "they'll obey thlayli, sir," said blackavar, before hazel could reply. "i think
he's the one to get them started."
     bigwig was still lying in the bilgewater, in the place he had taken up when they
came to the first bridge. he seemed to be asleep, but when silver nuzzled him he
raised his head and looked about in a dazed manner.

     "oh, hello, silver," he said. "i'm afraid this shoulder of mine's going to be a
bother. i feel awfully cold, too. where's hazel?"
     silver explained. bigwig got up with difficulty and they saw that he was still
bleeding. he limped to the thwart and climbed on it.
     "hyzenthlay," he said, "your friends can't be any wetter, so we'll get them to

thrayonlosa, was clearly in a bad way and blackberry and thethuthinnang swam
through together, one in front of her and one behind.
     as darkness closed in, the rain stopped. hazel and blackavar went back to the
bank of the pool below the bridge. the sky cleared and the oppression lifted as
the thunder moved away eastward. but it was fu inl√© before bigwig himself came
through the bridge with silver and fiver. it was as much as ever he could do to
keep afloat, and when he reached the grating he rolled over in the water, belly
uppermost, like a dying fish. he drifted into the shallows and, with silver's help,
pulled himself out. hazel and several of the others were waiting for him, but he
cut them short with a flash of his old bullying manner. "come on, get out of the
way," he said. "i'm going to sleep now, hazel, and frith help you if you say i'm
not."
     "that's how we go on, you see,"

onlosa gone and, searching, had found her in a clump of
reeds downstream. evidently the poor creature had felt that she was going to die
and, in the manner of animals, had slipped away.
     the news depressed hazel. he knew that they had been lucky to get so many
does out of efrafa and to escape from woundwort without having to stand and
fight. the plan had been a good one, but the storm and the frightening efficiency
of the efrafans had nearly defeated it. for all the courage of bigwig and of silver,
they would have failed without kehaar. now kehaar was going to leave them,
bigwig was wounded, and his own leg was none too good. with the does to look
after, they would not be able to travel in the open as fast or as easily as they had
on the way down from watership. he would have liked to stay where they were
for a few days, so that bigwig could recover his strength and the does find their
feet and get used to life outside a warren. but the place, he realized, was
hopelessly inhospitable. al

he said. "is that
woundwort?"
     "no," said blackavar, at his shoulder. "that's captain campion."
     "i see," said hazel. "well, i've heard of you, campion. i don't know whether
you mean us any harm, but the best thing you can do is to let well alone. as far as
we're concerned, our dealings with efrafa are finished."
     "you may think that," replied campion, "but you'll find it's otherwise. that doe
behind you must come with us; and so must any others that are with you."
     as he spoke, silver and acorn appeared lower down the slope, followed by
thethuthinnang. after a glance at the efrafans, silver spoke quickly to
thethuthinnang, who slipped back through the burdocks. then he came up to
hazel.
     "i've sent for the white bird, hazel," he said quietly.
     as a piece of bluff it was effective. they saw campion look upward nervously
and another of the patrol glanced back to the cover of the bushes.
     "what you're saying is stupid," said hazel to campion. "there are a lot of us

     "i have a great many more rabbits," he said. "the does must stay here. the rest
of you can go. otherwise we shall kill you."
     "very well," said hazel. "bring your whole patrol into the open and we'll do as
you say."
     by this time a considerable number of rabbits was coming up the slope.
campion and his patrol looked at them in silence but made no move.
     "you'd better stay where you are," said hazel at length. "if you try to interfere
with us it will be the worse for you. silver and blackberry, take the does and go
on. the rest of us will join you."
     "hazel-rah," whispered blackavar, "the patrol must be killed -- all of them.
they mustn't report back to the general."
     this had also occurred to hazel. but as he thought of the dreadful fight and the
four efrafans actually torn to pieces -- for that was what it would mean -- he
could not find it in his heart to do it. like bigwig, he felt a reluctant liking for
campion. besides, it would take some doing. quite pro

went. apart from his dislike of the whole idea, there were disadvantages that
might be fatal.
     "no, we'll let them alone," he replied firmly.
     blackavar was silent and they sat watching campion as the last of the does
disappeared through the bushes.
     "now," said hazel, "take your patrol and go the same way that you saw us
come. don't speak -- go."
     campion and the patrol made off downhill and hazel, relieved to be rid of
them so easily, hurried after silver, with the others close behind.
     once through the belt, they made excellent progress. after the rest of a day
and a half the does were in good shape. the promise of an end to the journey that
night and the thought that they had escaped both the fox and the patrol made
them eager and responsive. the only cause of delay was blackavar, who seemed
uneasy and kept hanging about in the rear. at last, in the late afternoon, hazel
sent for him and told him to go ahead, on the line of the path they w

n and unhappiness in efrafa had been due simply to not being
allowed to dig. even clover and haystack found that they could manage pretty
well and boasted that they would bear the warren's first litters in burrows that
they had dug themselves. blackavar and holly became close friends. they talked a
great deal about their different ideas of scouting and tracking, and made some
patrols together, more for their own satisfaction than because there was any real
need. one early morning they persuaded silver to come with them and traveled

over a mile to the outskirts of kingsclere, returning with a tale of mischief and
feasting in a cottage garden. blackavar's hearing had weakened since the
mutilation of his ears; but holly found that his power of noticing and drawing
conclusions from anything unusual was almost uncanny and that he seemed to be
able to become invisible at will.
     sixteen bucks and ten does made a happy enough society for a warren. there
was some bickering here and there, but n

     "i'm certain," answered holly. "we could smell them; and we heard them, too
-- below us in the combe. we wondered what so many rabbits could be doing
there and we were going down to see when we suddenly came face to face with
campion. we looked at him and he looked at us and then i realized what it must
mean and we turned and ran. he didn't follow us -- probably because he'd had no
orders. but how long will it take them to get here?"
     blackavar had returned from underground, bringing silver and blackberry.
     "we ought to leave at once, sir," he said to hazel. "we might be able to get
quite a long way before they come."
     hazel looked about him. "anyone who wants to go can go," he said. "i shan't.
we made this warren ourselves and frith only knows what we've been through on
account of it. i'm not going to leave it now."
     "neither am i," said bigwig. "if i'm for the black rabbit, there's one or two
from efrafa will come with me."
     there was a short silence.

was ready to hunt again. but the efrafans were accustomed to a death here and
there. unless general woundwort himself were killed, they would stay until the
job was done. nothing would stop them, short of some unexpected catastrophe.
     but suppose that he himself were to go and talk to woundwort? might there
not just possibly be a chance of getting him to see sense? whatever had happened
at nutley copse, the efrafans could not fight to the finish against rabbits like
bigwig, holly and silver without losing lives -- probably a good many lives.
woundwort must know this. perhaps it might not be too late, even now, to
persuade him to agree to a new plan -- a plan that would be as good for one
warren as the other.
     "and perhaps it might be," thought hazel grimly. "but it's a possible chance
and so i'm afraid the chief rabbit has got to take it. and since this savage brute is
probably not to be trusted, i suppose the chief rabbit must go alone."

lay between the tree roots. he came at once upon the open run. he listened, but
all was quiet. vervain (who was more used to dealing with prisoners than with
enemies) ordered two of his rabbits to make their way down it. the discovery of
the silent, open run gave him the hope that he might be able to seize the warren
by a sudden dash to the very center. the wretched rabbits, obeying his orders,
were met by silver and buckthorn at a point where the run opened out. they were
cuffed and mauled and barely got out with their lives. the sight of them did
nothing to encourage vervain's party, who were reluctant to dig and made little
headway during the darkness before moonrise.
     groundsel, who felt that he ought to set an example, himself dug his way into
the loose, fallen soil of one of the bank runs. plowing over the soft earth like a fly
on summer butter and holding his head clear, he suddenly found him

king of anything else. the hopelessness of their chances
had no important place in his thoughts. even the sound of the digging, clearer
already, only set him thinking of the best way to sell his life as dearly as he could.
but what else was there for any of them to do? at least bigwig's preparations
would keep the others busy and perhaps do something to dispel the silent fear
that filled all the warren.
     "you're quite right, bigwig," he said. "let's prepare a little reception. will you
tell silver and the others what you want and get them started?"
     as bigwig began to explain his plan to silver and holly, hazel sent speedwell
to the north end of the honeycomb to listen to the digging and keep reporting
what he could make out about its progress. as far as he could see, it would make
little difference whether the roof-fall came there or in the center, but at least he
ought to try to show the others that he was keeping his wits about him.

know it's a risk, but it'll be better than just trying to stand up in front of a rabbit
like woundwort."
     "but suppose they break through the wall somewhere else?" said holly.
     "you must try to make them do it here," replied bigwig. "when you hear them
on the other side, make a noise -- do a bit of scratching or something -- just above
where i am. anything to get them interested. come on, help me to dig. and,
silver, get everyone back out of the honeycomb now and close this wall
completely."

     "bigwig," said pipkin, "i can't wake fiver. he's still lying out there in the
middle of the floor. what's to be done?"
     "i'm afraid there's nothing we can do now," replied bigwig. "it's a great pity,
but we'll have to leave him."
     "oh, bigwig," cried pipkin, "let me stay out there with him! you'll never miss
me, and i can go on trying--"
     "hlao-roo," said holly as kindly as he could, "if we lose no o

that he goes back with the others."
     when woundwort dropped through the roof of the honeycomb, bigwig was
already lying under a thin covering of soil on the other side of the south wall, not
far from clover's burrow.

     thunder sank his teeth into a piece of broken root and pulled it out. there was
an instant fall of earth and a gap opened where he had been digging. the soil no
longer reached to the roof. it was only a broad pile of soft earth, half filling the
run.

 came. back in the honeycomb, groundsel
immediately surrendered himself and his fugitives to fiver, who was still
bemused from his long trance, and scarcely restored to his senses sufficiently to
grasp what was toward. at length, however, after the five efrafans had remained
crouching for some time in the burrow, listening to the sounds of the dog hunting
above, fiver recovered himself, made his way to the mouth of the run where
bigwig still lay half conscious, and succeeded in making holly and silver
understand that the siege was ended. there was no lack of helpers to tear open
the blocked gaps in the south wall. it so happened that bluebell was the first
through into the honeycomb; and for many days afterward he was still improving
upon his imitation of captain fiver at the head of his crowd of efrafan prisoners
-- "like a tomtit rounding up a bunch of molting jackdaws," as he put it.

tility for the does starts about february. there are fine

days when silflay is still enjoyable. for the adventurous, garden-raiding has its
charms. and underground there are stories to be told and games to be played --
bob-stones and the like. for rabbits, winter remains what it was for men in the
middle ages -- hard, but bearable by the resourceful and not altogether without
compensations.
     on the west side of the beech hanger, in the evening sun, hazel and fiver were
sitting with holly, silver and groundsel. the efrafan survivors had been allowed
to join the warren and after a shaky start, when they were regarded with dislike
and suspicion, were settling down pretty well, largely because hazel was
determined that they should.
     since the night of the siege, fiver had spent much time alone and even in the
honeycomb, or at morning and evening silflay, was often silent and preoccupied.
no one resented this -- "he looks right through you in such a nice, friendly way,"

     "i don't know about clover," said hazel. "she's a hutch rabbit: it may be
natural to her to breed at any time, for all i know. but i'm sure that hyzenthlay
and vilthuril started their litters in the high summer because they'd had no
natural life in efrafa. for all that, they're the only two who have had litters, as
yet."
     "frith never meant us to go out fighting in the high summer, either, if that
comes to that," said silver. "everything that's happened is unnatural -- the
fighting, the breeding -- and all on account of woundwort. if he wasn't unnatural,
who was?"
     "bigwig was right when he said he wasn't like a rabbit at all," said holly. "he
was a fighting animal -- fierce as a rat or a dog. he fought because he actually felt
safer fighting than running. he was brave, all right. but it wasn't natural; and
that's why it was bound to finish him in the end. he was trying to do something

some gave their lives. it was worth it, to feel we were efrafans. for the first time
ever, rabbits didn't go scurrying away. the elil feared us. and that was on account
of woundwort -- him and no one but him. we weren't good enough for the
general. depend upon it, he's gone to start another warren somewhere else. but
no efrafan officer will ever forget him."
     "well, now i'll tell you something," began silver. but hazel cut him short.
     "you mustn't say you weren't good enough," he said. "you did everything for
him that rabbits could do and a great deal more. and what a lot we learned from
you! as for efrafa, i've heard it's doing well under campion, even if some things
aren't quite the same as they used to be. and listen -- by next spring, if i'm right,
we shall have too many rabbits here for comfort. i'm going to encourage some of
the youngsters to start a new warren between here and efrafa; an

the right fellow to start that scheme off."
     "won't it be difficult to arrange?" asked holly.
     "not when kehaar comes," said hazel, as they began to hop easily back toward
the holes at the northeast corner of the hanger. "he'll turn up one of these days,
when the storms begin on that big water of his. he can take a message to
campion as quickly as you'd run down to the iron tree and back."
     "by frith in the leaves, and i know someone who'll be glad to see him!" said
silver. "someone not so very far away."
     they had reached the eastern end of the trees and here, well out in the open
where it was still sunny, a little group of three young rabbits -- bigger than
hyzenthlay's -- were squatting in the long grass, listening to a hulking veteran,
lop-eared and scarred from nose to haunch -- none other than bigwig, captain of
a very free-and-easy owsla. these were the bucks of clover's litter and a likely lot
they looked.
     "oh, no, no, no, no," bigwig was saying.

     "oh, yes, sir," answered the young rabbit. after a pause, he said politely, "er --
you lost your tail?"
     "will you tell us about the fight in the storm, sir?" asked one of the other
rabbits, "and the tunnel of water?"
     "yes, later on," said the relentless trainer. "now look, i'm a cat, right? i'm

asleep in the sun, right? and you're going to get past me, right? now then--"
     "they pull his leg, you know," said silver, "but they'd do anything for him."
holly and groundsel had gone underground and silver and hazel moved out
once more into the sun.
     "i think we all would," replied hazel. "if it hadn't been for him that day, the
dog would have come too late. woundwort and his lot wouldn't have been above
ground. they'd have been down below, finishing what they'd come to do."
     "he beat woundwort, you know," said silver. "he had him beat before the dog
came. that was what i was going to say just now, but

it was as well i didn't, i
suppose."
     "i wonder how they're getting on with that winter burrow down the hill," said
hazel. "we're going to need it when the hard weather comes. that hole in the roof
of the honeycomb doesn't help at all. it'll close up naturally one day, i suppose,
but meanwhile it's a confounded nuisance."
     "here come the burrow-diggers, anyway," said silver.
     pipkin and bluebell came over the crest, together with three or four of the
does.
     "ah ha, ah ha, o hazel-rah," said bluebell. "the burrow's snug, it hath been
dug, t'is free from beetle, worm and slug. and in the snow, when down we go--"
     "then what a lot to you we'll owe," said hazel. "i mean it, too. the holes are
concealed, are they?"
     "just like efrafa, i should think," said bluebell. "as a matter of fact, i brought
one up with me to show you. you can't see it, can you? n

o -- well, there you are. i
say, just look at old bigwig with those youngsters over there. you know, if he went
back to efrafa now they couldn't decide which mark to put him in, could they?
he's got them all."
     "come over to the evening side of the wood with us, hazel-rah?" said pipkin.
"we came up early on purpose to have a bit of sunshine before it gets dark."
     "all right," answered hazel good-naturedly. "we've just come back from there,
silver and i, but i don't mind slipping over again for a bit."
     "let's go out to that little hollow where we found kehaar that morning," said
silver. "it'll be out of the wind. d'you remember how he cursed at us and tried to
peck us?"
     "and the worms we carried?" said bluebell. "don't forget them."
     as they came near the hollow they could hear that it was not empty. evidently
some of the other rabbits had had the same idea.

hollow, squeaking "hazel-rah! hazel-rah!" and jumping on hazel from all sides.
     "here, wait a minute," said hazel, cuffing them off. "i didn't come here to get
mixed up in a fight with a lot of roughs like you! let's hear the rest of the story."
     "but there's a man coming on a horse, hazel-rah," said one of the young
rabbits. "oughtn't we to run into the wood?"
     "how can you tell?" asked hazel. "i can't hear anything."
     "neither can i," said silver, listening with his ears up.
     the little rabbit looked puzzled.
     "i don't know how, hazel-rah," he answered, "but i'm sure i'm not mistaken."
     they waited for some little time, while the red sun sank lower. at last, just as
vilthuril was about to go on with the story, they heard hooves on the turf and the
horseman appeared from the west, cantering easily along the track toward
cannon heath down.
     "he won't bother us," said silver. "no need to run: he'll just go by. you're a

- no doubt some young buck who had come to ask his advice. the
sentry in the run outside should not really have let him in without asking first.
never mind, thought hazel. he raised his head and said, "do you want to talk to
me?"
     "yes, that's what i've come for," replied the other. "you know me, don't you?"
     "yes, of course," said hazel, hoping he would be able to remember his name in
a moment. then he saw that in the darkness of the burrow the stranger's ears
were shining with a faint silver light. "yes, my lord," he said, "yes, i know you."
     "you've been feeling tired," said the stranger, "but i can do something about
that. i've come to ask whether you'd care to join my owsla. we shall be glad to
have you and you'll enjoy it. if you're ready, we might go along now."
     they went out past the young sentry, who paid the visitor no attention. the
sun was shining and in spite of the cold there were a few bucks and does at silflay,
keeping out of the wind as they nibbled the shoo
