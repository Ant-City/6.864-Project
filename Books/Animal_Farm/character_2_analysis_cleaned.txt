[CHARACTER]
the most sympathetically drawn character in the novel,
[CHARACTER] epitomizes all of the best qualities of the exploited working
classes: dedication, loyalty, and a huge capacity for labor. he
also, however, suffers from what orwell saw as the working class's
major weaknesses: a naive trust in the good intentions of the intelligentsia
and an inability to recognize even the most blatant forms of political
corruption. exploited by the pigs as much or more than he had been
by mr. jones, [CHARACTER] represents all of the invisible labor that undergirds the
political drama being carried out by the elites. [CHARACTER]'s pitiful death
at a glue factory dramatically illustrates the extent of the pigs' betrayal.
it may also, however, speak to the specific significance of [CHARACTER]
himself: before being carted off, he serves as the force that holds
animal farm together.
