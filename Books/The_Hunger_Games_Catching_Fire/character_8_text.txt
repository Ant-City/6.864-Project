e  whole  time  thinking  about  how  i  killed  both  the 
tributes from their district, glimmer and marvel, last year, and that they probably knew them 
and might even have been their mentors. both my hammock and my attempt to connect with 
them are mediocre at best. i join enobaria at sword training and exchange a few comments, 

but  it's  clear  neither  of  us  wants  to  team  up.  finnick  appears  again  when  i'm  picking  up 
fishing  tips,  but  mostly  just  to  introduce  me  to  mags,  the  elderly  woman  who's  also  from 
district 4. between her district accent and her garbled speech — possibly she's had a stroke 
— i can't make out more than one in four words. but i swear she can make a decent fishhook 
out  of  anything—a  thorn,  a  wishbone,  an  earring.  after  a  while  i  tune  out  the  trainer  and 
simply try to copy whatever mags does. when i make a pretty good hook out of a bent nail 
and fasten it to some strands of my hair, she gives me a toothless s

we're called to eat, haymitch pounces on me immediately. “so at least half the victors 
have  instructed  their  mentors  to  request  you  as  an  ally.  i  know  it  can't  be  your  sunny 
personality.” 

“they saw her shoot,” says peeta with a smile. “actually, i saw her shoot, for real, for the 

first time. i'm about to put in a formal request myself.” 

“you're that good?” haymitch asks me. “so good that brutus wants you?” 

i shrug. “but i don't want brutus. i want mags and district three.” 

“of course you do.” haymitch sighs and orders a bottle of wine. “i'll tell everybody you're 

still making up your mind.” 

after  my  shooting  exhibition,  i  still  get  teased  some,  but  i  no  longer  feel  like  i'm  being 
mocked.  in  fact,  i  feel  as  if  i've  somehow  been  initiated  into the  victors'  circle.  during  the 
next  two  days,  i  spend  time  with  almost  everybody  headed  for  the  arena.  even  the

protect them. but all of them must die if i'm to save peeta. 

the  final  day  of  training  ends  with  our  private  sessions.  we  each  get  fifteen  minutes 
before the gamemakers to amaze them with our skills, but i don't know what any of us might 
have to show them. there's a lot of kidding about it at lunch. what we might do. sing, dance, 
strip,  tell  jokes.  mags,  who  i  can  understand  a  little  better  now,  decides  she's  just  going  to

surprise them if we could, but i'm fresh out of ideas. 

as the girl from 12, i'm scheduled to go last. the dining room gets quieter and quieter as 
the  tributes  file  out  to  go  perform.  it's  easier  to  keep  up  the  irreverent,  invincible  manner 
we've all adopted when there are more of us. as people disap

sure  enough,  gloss,  cashmere,  enobaria,  and  brutus  have  gathered,  their  pack  formed 
already, picking over the weapons. a quick survey of the rest of the arena shows that most of 
the tributes are still trapped on their plates. wait, no, there's someone standing on the spoke 
to  my  left,  the one  opposite  peeta.  it's  mags.  but  she  neither  heads  for the  cornucopia  nor 
tries to flee. instead she splashes into the water and starts paddling toward me, her gray head 
bobbing above the waves. well, she's old, but i guess after eighty years of living in district 4 
she can keep afloat. 

finnick has reached peeta now and is towing him back, one arm across his chest while the 
other propels them through the water with easy strokes. peeta rides along without resisting. i

convinced him to put his life in his hands — showed 
him the bangle, maybe. or just the sight of me waiting might have been enough. when they 
reach the sand, i help haul peeta up onto dry land. 

“hello, again,” he says, and gives me a kiss. “we've got allies.” 

“yes. just as haymitch intended,” i answer. “remind me, did we make deals with anyone 

else?” peeta asks. 

“only  mags,  i  think,”  i  say.  i  nod  toward  the  old  woman  doggedly  making  her  way 

toward us. 

“well, i can't leave mags behind,” says finnick. “she's one of the few people who actually 

likes me.” 

“i've  got  no  problem  with  mags,”  i  say.  “especially  now  that  i  see  the  arena.  het 

fishhooks are probably our best chance of getting a meal.” 

“katniss wanted her on the first day,” says peeta. 

“katniss has remarkably good judgment,” says finnick. wi

that i think includes the word “bob,” then pats her belt. 

“look, she's right. someone figured it out.” finnick points to beetee. he's flailing around 

in the waves but managing to keep his head above water. 

“what?” i say. 

“the belts. they're flotation devices,” says finnick. “i mean, you have to propel yourself, 

but they'll keep you from drowning.” 

i almost ask finnick to wait, to get beetee and wiress a

three  spokes  over  and  i  can't  even  see  wiress.  for  all  i  know,  finnick  would  kill  them  as 
quickly as he did the tribute from 5, so instead i suggest we move on. i hand peeta a bow, a 
sheath of arrows, and a knife, keeping the rest for myself. but mags tugs on my sleeve and 
babbles on until i've given the awl to her. pleased, she clamps the handle between her gums 
and reaches her arms up to finnick. he tosses his net over his shoulder, hoists mags on top of 
it, grips his tridents in his free hand, and we run away from the cornucopia. 

where the sand ends, woods begin to rise sharply. no, not really woods. at least not the 
kind  i  know. jungle.  the  foreign,  almost obsolete  word  comes  to  mind.  something  i  heard

obscured by tangles of vines with colorful blossoms. while the sun's hot and bright, the air's 
warm and heavy with moisture, and i get the feeling i will never really be dry here. the thin 
blue fabric of my jumpsuit lets the seawater evaporate easily, but it's already begun to cling to 
me with sweat. 

peeta takes the lead, cutting through the patches of dense vegetation with his long knife. i 
make finnick go second because even though he's the most powerful, he's got his hands full 
with mags. besides, while he's a whiz with that trident, it's a weapon less suited to the jungle 
than my arrows. it doesn't take long, between the steep incline and the heat, to become short 
of  breath.  peeta  and  i  have  been  training  intensely,  though,  and  finnick's  such  an  amazing 
physical specimen that even with mags over his shoulder, we climb rapidly for about a mile 
before he requests a rest. and then i think it's more for mags's sake than his own.

it's  fixed  in  space,  not  shifting  when  i  move.  and  that's  when  i  connect  the  square  with 
wiress and beetee in the training center and realize what lies before us. my warning cry is 
just reaching my lips when peeta's knife swings out to slash away some vines. 

there's a sharp zapping sound. for an instant, the trees are gone and i see open space over 
a short stretch of  bare earth. then peeta's  flung  back  from the  force  field, bringing  finnick 
and mags to the ground. 

i rush over to where he lies, motionless in a web of vines. “peeta?” there's a faint smell of 
singed hair. i call his name again, giving him a little shake, but he's unresponsive. my fingers 
fumble across his lips, where there's no warm breath although moments ago he was panting. i 
press my ear against his chest, to the spot where i always rest my head, where i know i will 
hear the strong and steady beat of his heart. 

instead, i find silence.

i scream. i shake him harder, even resort to slapping his face, but it's no use. his 

heart has failed. i am slapping emptiness. “peeta!” 

finnick  props  mags  against  a tree  and  pushes  me  out  of  the  way.  “let  me.”  his  fingers 
touch points at peeta's neck, run over the bones in his ribs and spine. then he pinches peeta's 
nostrils shut. 

“no!” i yell, hurling myself at finnick, for surely he intends to make certain that peeta's 
dead, to keep any hope of life from returning to him. finnick's hand comes up and hits me so 
hard, so squarely in the chest that i go flying back into a nearby tree trunk. i'm stunned for a 
moment,  by

so how can i kill him in his sleep? 

i  expect  to  see  a  smug  or  sarcastic  expression  on  his  face,  but  his  look  is  strangely 
quizzical. he glances between peeta and me, as if trying to figure something out, then gives 
his head a slight shake as if to clear it. “how are you?” he asks peeta. “do you think you can 
move on?” 

“no, he has to rest,” i say. my nose is running like crazy and i don't even have a shred of 
fabric to use as a handkerchief. mags rips off a handful of hanging moss from a tree limb and 
gives it to me. i'm too much of a mess to even question it. i blow my nose loudly and mop the 
tears off my face. it's nice, the moss. absorbent and surprisingly soft. 

i notice a gleam of gold on peeta's chest. i reach out and retrieve the disk that hangs from 
a chain around his neck. my mockingjay has been engraved on it. “is this your token?” i ask. 

“yes. do you mind that i used your mockingjay? i wanted us to match,” he sa

“yeah,”  i  say,  then  give  a  shrug.  “maybe  they  did  a  better  job  than  they  thought.  you 
know,  sometimes  i  do  hear  funny  things  on  that  side.  things  you  wouldn't ordinarily  think 
have a sound. like insect wings. or snow hitting the ground.” perfect. now all the attention 
will turn to the surgeons who fixed my deaf ear after the games last year, and they'll have to 
explain why i can hear like a bat. 

“you,”  says  mags,  nudging  me  forward,  so  i  take  the  lead.  since  we're  to  be  moving 
slowly, mags prefers to walk with the aid of a branch finnick quickly fashions into a cane for 
her.  he  makes  a  staff  for  peeta  as  well,  which  is  good  because,  despite  his  protestations,  i 
think all peeta really wants to do is lie down. finnick brings up the rear, so at least someone 
alert has our backs. 

i  walk  with  the  force  field  on  my  left,  because  that's  supposed  to  be  the  side

grapes  from a  nearby tree and toss them ahead of  me as i go. it's good i do, too, because i 
have  a  feeling  i'm  missing  the  patches  that  indicate  the  force  field  more  often  than  i'm 
spotting  them.  whenever  a  nut  hits  the  force  field,  there's  a  puff  of  smoke  before  the  nut 
lands, blackened and with a cracked shell, on the ground at my feet. 

after a few minutes i become aware of a smacking sound behind me and turn to see mags 
peeling the shell off one of the nuts and popping it in her already-full mouth. “mags!” i cry. 
“spit that out. it could be poisonous.” 

she  mumbles  something  and  ignores  me,  licking  her  lips  with  apparent  relish.  i  look  to 

finnick for help but he just laughs. “i guess we'll find out,” he says. 

i go forward, wondering  about finnick, who saved old mags  but will  let  her eat strange 
nuts. who haymitch has stamped with his seal of approval. who brought peeta bac

that. but leaving the choice of if we fight to me. 

i keep walking, tossing my nuts, sometimes catching a glimpse of the force field, trying to 
press to the  left to find a spot where we can break through, get away  from the cornucopia, 
and  hopefully  find  water.  but  after  another  hour or  so of  this  i  realize  it's  futile.  we're  not 
making any progress to the left. in fact, the force field seems to be herding us along a curved 
path. i stop and look back at mags's limping form, the sheen of sweat on peeta's face. “let's 
take a break,” i say. “i need to get another look from above.” 

the tree i choose seems to jut higher  into the air than the others. i make  my way up the 
twisting boughs, staying as close to the trunk as possible. no telling how easily these rubbery 
branches will snap. still i climb beyond good sense because there's something i  have to see. 
as i cling to a stretch of trunk no wider than a sapling, swaying back and forth i

possible. plutarch heavensbee might have already been given orders to knock us off. “at any 
rate, there's no point in trying to find out what's over the edge of this hill, because the answer 
is nothing.” 

“there must be drinkable water between the force field and the wheel,” peeta insists. we 
all  know  what  this  means.  heading  back  down.  heading  back  to  the  careers  and  the 
bloodshed. with mags hardly able to walk and peeta too weak to fight. 

we  decide  to  move  down  the  slope  a  few  hundred  yards  and  continue  circling.  see  if 
maybe there's some water at that level. i stay in the lead, occasionally chucking a nut to my 
left, but we're well out of range of the force field now. the sun beats down on us, turning the 
air to steam, playing tricks on our eyes. by midafternoon, it's clear peeta and mags can't go 
on. 

finnick chooses a campsite about ten yards below the for

weapon  by  deflecting  our  enemies  into  it  if  attacked.  then  he  and  mags  pull  blades  of  the 
sharp  grass  that  grows  in  five-foot-high  tufts  and  begin  to  weave  them  together  into  mats. 
since  mags  seems  to  have  no  ill  effects  from  the  nuts,  peeta  collects  bunches  of  them  and 
fries them by bouncing them off the force field. he methodically peels off the shells, piling 
the meats on a leaf. i stand guard, fidgety and hot and raw with the emotions of the day.

else. its muzzle is wet. like an animal that's been drinking from a stream. excited, i start at 
its home tree and move slowly out in a spiral. it can't be far, the creature's water source. 

nothing. i find nothing. not so much as a dewdrop. eventually, because i know peeta will 

be worried about me, i head back to the camp, hotter and more frustrated than ever. 

when i arrive, i see the others have transformed the place. mags and finnick have created 
a hut of sorts out of the grass mats, open on one side but with three walls, a floor, and a roof. 
mags has also plaited several bowls that peeta has filled with roasted nuts. their faces turn to 
me  hopefully,  but  i  give  my  head  a  shake.  “no.  no  water. it's  out there, though.  he  knew 
where  it  was,”  i  say,  hoisting  the  skinned  rodent  up  for  all  to  see.  “he'd  been  drinking

there's no chance of hiding it. 

peeta has another idea. he takes a cube of rodent meat, skewers it on the tip of a pointed 
stick, and  lets  it fall  into the  force field. there's a sharp sizzle and the stick  flies  back. the 
chunk of  meat  is  blackened on the outside  but well cooked inside. we give  him a round of 
applause, then quickly stop, remembering where we are. 

the white sun sinks in the rosy sky as we gather in the hut. i'm still  leery about the nuts, 
but finnick says mags recognized them from another games. i didn't bother spending time at 
the edible-plants station in training because it was so effortless for me last year. now i wish i 
had. for surely there would have been some of the unfamiliar plants surrounding me. and i 
might have guessed a bit more about where i was headed. mags seems fine, though, and she's 
been eating the nuts for hours. so i pick one up and take a small bite. it has a mild, slightly 
sweet  flavor  that  reminds  me  of  a  chestnut.

the  horizon,  a  pale  white  moon  rises,  making  things  just  visible  enough.  our  conversation 
trails off because we know what's coming. we position ourselves in a line at the mouth of the 
hut and peeta slips his hand into mine. 

the sky brightens when the seal of the capitol appears as if floating in space. as i listen to 
the strains of the anthem i think, it will be harder for finnick and mags. but it turns out to be 
plenty hard for me as well. seeing the faces of the eight dead victors projected into the sky. 

the  man  from district 5, the one finnick took out with his trident, is the  first to  appear. 
that  means  that  all  the  tributes  in  1  through  4  are  alive  —  the  four  careers,  beetee  and 
wiress, and, of course, mags and finnick. the man from district 5 is followed by the male

taking turns examining it. it's a hollow metal tube, tapered slightly at one end. on the other 
end  a  small  lip  curves  downward.  it's  vaguely  familiar.  a  part  that  could  have  fallen  off  a 
bicycle, a curtain rod, anything, really. 

peeta blows on one end to see if it makes a sound. it doesn't. finnick slides his pinkie into 

it, testing it out as a weapon. useless. 

“can you fish with it, mags?” i ask. mags, who can fish with almost anything, shakes her 

head and grunts. 

i  take  it  and  roll  it  back  and  forth  on  my  palm.  since  we're  allies,  haymitch  will  be 
working  with  the  district  4  mentors.  he  had  a  hand  in  choosing  this  gift.  that  means  it's

“to make syrup,” says peeta. “but there must be something else inside these trees.” 

we're all on our feet at once. our thirst. the lack of springs. the tree rat's sharp front teeth 
and wet muzzle. there can only be one thing worth having inside these trees. finnick goes to 
hammer the spile into the green bark of a massive tree with a rock, but i stop him. “wait. you 
might damage it. we need to drill a hole first,” i say. 

there's  nothing to drill with, so mags offers  her  awl and peeta drives  it straight  into the 
bark, burying the spike two inches deep. he and finnick take turns opening up the hole with 
the awl and the knives until it can hold the spile. i wedge it in carefully and we all stand back 
in anticipation. 

at  first  nothing  happens.  then  a  drop  of  water  rolls  down  the  lip  and  lands  in  mags's 

palm. she licks it off and holds out her hand for more. 

by  wiggling  and  adjusting  the  spile,  we  get  a  thin  stream

holding our mouths under the tap, wetting our parched tongues. mags brings over a  basket, 
and the grass is so tightly woven it holds water. we fill the basket and pass it around, taking 
deep gulps and, later, luxuriously, splashing our faces clean. like everything here, the water's 
on the warm side, but this is no time to be picky. 

without  our  thirst  to  distract  us,  we're  all  aware  of  how  exhausted  we  are  and  make

seems  to  be  the  tolling  of  a  bell. bong!  bong! it's  not  exactly  like  the  one  they  ring  in  the 
justice  building  on  new  year's  but  close  enough  for  me  to  recognize  it.  peeta  and  mags 
sleep through it, but finnick has the same look of attentiveness i feel. the tolling stops. 

“i counted twelve,” he says. 

i  nod.  twelve.  what  does  that  signify?  one  ring  for  each  district?  maybe.  but  why? 

“mean anything, do you think?” 

“no idea,” he says. 

we  wait  for  further  instructions,  maybe  a  message  from  claudius  templesmith.  an

alert. i grab his arm and begin to propel him through the jungle after finnick. 

“what is it? what is it?” he says in bewilderment. 

“some kind of fog. poisonous gas. hurry, peeta!” i urge. i can tell that however much he 
denied it during the day, the aftereffects of hitting the force field have been significant. he's 
slow, much slower than usual. and the tangle of vines and undergrowth, which unbalance me

along. i wedge  my  shoulder, which  still  seems under  my control, under peeta's arm and do 

my best to keep up with finnick’s rapid pace. we put about ten yards between us and the fog 
when finnick stops. 

“it’s no good. i'll have to carry him. can you take mags?” he asks me. 

“yes,”  i  say  stoutly,  although  my  heart  sinks.  it's  true  that  mags  can't  weigh  more  than 
about seventy pounds, but i'm not very big myself. still, i'm sure i've carried heavier loads. if 
only  my  arms  would  stop  jumping  around.  i  squat  down  and  she  positions  herself  over  my 
shoulder,  the  way  she  rides  on  finnick.  i  slowly  straighten  my  legs  and,  with  my  knees 
locked, i can manage her. finnick has peeta slung across his back n

instinct is to run directly away from it, i realize finnick is moving at a diagonal down the hill. 
he's trying to keep a distance from the gas while steering us toward the water that surrounds 
the  cornucopia.  yes,  water,  i  think  as  the  acid  droplets  bore  deeper  into  me.  now  i'm  so 
thankful i didn't kill  finnick,  because  how would i have gotten peeta out of here alive? so 
thankful to have someone else on my side, even if it's only temporarily. 

it's  not  mags's  fault  when  i  begin  falling.  she's  doing  everything  she  can  to  be  an  easy 
passenger, but the fact is, there is only so much weight i can handle. especially now that my 
right leg seems to be going stiff. the first two times i crash to the ground, i manage to make 
it back on my feet, but the third time, i cannot get my leg to cooperate. as i struggle to get

much surety as i can muster. 

i can see  finnick's eyes, green  in the  moonlight. i can see them  as clear as day.  almost 
like a cat's, with a strange reflective quality. maybe because they are shiny with tears. “no,” 
he  says.  “i  can't  carry  them  both.  my  arms  aren't  working.”  it's  true.  his  arms  jerk 
uncontrollably at his sides. his hands are empty. of his three tridents, only one remains, and 
it's in peeta's hands. “i'm sorry, mags. i can't do it.” 

what happens next is so fast, so senseless, i can't even move to stop it. mags hauls herself 
up,  plants  a  kiss  on  finnick's  lips,  and  then  hobbles  straight  into the  fog.  immediately,  her 
body is seized by wild contortions and she falls to the ground in a horrible dance. 

i want to scream, but my throat is on fire. i take one futile step in her direction when i hear 
the cannon blast, know her heart has stopped, that she is dead. “finnick?” i call out ho

are dead, or clearly dying. and mags is dead. this is something i know, or maybe just think i 
know, because it makes no sense at all. 

moonlight  glinting  on  finnick's  bronze  hair,  beads  of  searing  pain  peppering  me,  a  leg 
turned to wood. i follow finnick until he collapses on the ground, peeta still on top of him. i 
seem  to  have  no  ability  to  stop  my  own  forward  motion  and  simply  propel  myself  onward 
until  i  trip  over  their  prone  bodies,  just  one  more  on  the  heap. this  is  where  and

peak. 

“i'm going to try to tap a tree,” i say. my fingers fumble at my belt and find the spile still 

hanging from its vine. 

“let me make the hole first,” says peeta. “you stay with him. you're the healer.” 

that's a joke, i think. but i don't say it out loud, since finnick has enough to deal with. he 
got the worst of the fog, although i'm not sure why. maybe because he's the biggest or maybe 
because  he  had  to  exert  himself  the  most.  and  then,  of  course,  there's  mags.  i  still  don't 
understand what happened there. why he essentially abandoned her to carry peeta. why she 
not only didn't question it, but ran straight to her death without a moment's hesitation. was it 
because she was so old that her days were  numbered, anyway? did they think that finnick 
would stand a better chance of winning if he had peeta and me as allies? the haggard look on 
finnick's face tells me that now is not the moment to ask. 

instead  i  try  to  put  myself  back  togethe

 really  necessary,  but 
brutus  blocked  my  arrow  with  his,  so  i  buckle  it  back  on,  thinking  it  might  offer  some 
protection. i undo my hair and comb it with my fingers, thinning it out considerably since the 
fog droplets damaged it. then i braid back what's left of it. 

peeta has found a good tree about ten yards from the narrow strip of beach. we can hardly 
see him, but the sound of his knife against the wooden trunk is crystal clear. i wonder what 
happened  to  the  awl.  mags  must’ve  either  dropped  it  or  taken  it  into  the  fog  with  her. 
anyway, it's gone. 

i have moved out a bit farther into the shallows, floating alternately on my belly and back. 
if  the  seawater  healed  peeta  and  me,  it  seems  to  be  transforming  finnick  altogether.  he 
begins to move slowly, just testing his limbs, and gradually begins to swim. but it's not like 
me  swimming,  the  rhythmic  strokes,  the  even  pace.  it's  like  watching  some  strange  sea

ater begins to gush from the spile. we slake our thirst, let the warm water pour over 
our itching bodies. we fill a handful of shells with drinking water and go back to the beach. 

it's still night, though dawn can't be too many hours away. unless the gamemakers want it 

to be. “why don't you two get some rest?” i say. “i'll watch for a while.” 

“no,  katniss,  i'd  rather,”  says  finnick.  i  look  in  his  eyes,  at  his  face,  and  realize  he's 

barely holding back tears. mags. the least i can do is give him the privacy to mourn her. 

“all  right,  finnick,  thanks,”  i  say.  i  lie  down  on  the  sand  with  peeta,  who  drifts  off  at 
once.  i  stare  into  the  night,  thinking  of  what  a  difference  a  day  makes.  how  yesterday 
morning, finnick was on my kill list, and now i'm willing to sleep with him as my guard. he 
saved peeta and let mags die and i don't know why. only that i can never settle the balance 
owed between us. all i can do at the m

h  loaf of  bread. remembering  from 
last year how haymitch's gifts are often timed to send a message, i make a note to myself. be 
friends with finnick. you'll get food. 

finnick turns the bread over in his hands, examining the crust. a bit too possessively. it's 
not necessary. it's got that green tint from seaweed that the bread from district 4 always has. 
we all know it's his. maybe he's just realized how precious it is, and that he may never see 
another loaf again. maybe some memory of mags is associated with the crust. but all he says 
is, “this will go well with the shellfish.” 

while i help peeta coat his skin with the ointment, finnick deftly cleans the meat from the 
shellfish. we gather round and eat the delicious sweet flesh with the salty bread from district 
4. 

we all look monstrous—the ointment seems to be causing some of the scabs to peel — but 
i'm glad for the medicine. not just because it gives relief from the itching, but also because it 
acts as protect

fortunately it's not too deep. he's lost a lot of blood, though—you can tell by the pallor of his 
skin — and it's still oozing out of the wound. 

i sit back on my heels, trying to think. what do i have to work with? seawater? i feel like 
my mother when her first line of defense for treating everything was snow. i look over at the 
jungle. i bet there's a whole pharmacy  in there  if  i knew  how to use it. but these aren't  my 
plants. then i think about the moss mags gave me to blow my nose. “be right back,” i tell 
peeta. fortunately the stuff seems to be pretty common in the jungle. i rip an armful from the 
nearby trees and carry  it  back to the beach. i  make a thick pad out of the  moss, place  it on 

beetee's cut, and secure it by tying vines around his body. we get some water into him and 
then pull him into the shade at the edge of the jungle. 

“i think that's all we can do,” i say. 

“it's good. you're good with this healing stuff,”

thing  into  wiress.  finnick  tells  about the  fog  and  the  monkeys  in  a  detached, 
almost clinical voice, avoiding the most important detail of the story. 

everybody offers to guard while the others rest, but in the end, it's johanna and i who stay 
up. me because i'm really rested, she because she simply refuses to lie down. the two of us 
sit in silence on the beach until the others have gone to sleep. 

johanna glances over at finnick, to be sure, then turns to me. “how'd you lose mags?” 

“in  the  fog.  finnick  had  peeta.  i  had  mags  for  a  while.  then  i  couldn't  lift  her.  finnick 

said he couldn't take them both. she kissed him and walked right into the poison,” i say. 

“she was finnick's mentor, you know,” johanna says accusingly. 

“no, i didn't,” i say. 

“she was half his family,” she says a few moments later, but there's less venom behind it. 

we watch the water lap up over the undergarments. “so what were you doing with nuts

weapon he could have.” 

there's  something  odd  about  johanna  not  putting  this  together.  something  that  doesn't 
quite  ring  true.  suspicious.  “seems  like  you'd  have  figured  that  out,”  i  say.  “since  you 
nicknamed him volts and all.” 

johanna's eyes narrow at me dangerously. “yeah, that was really stupid of me, wasn't it?” 
she says. “i guess i must have been distracted by keeping your little friends alive. while you 
were...what, again? getting mags killed off?” 

my fingers tighten on the knife handle at my belt. 

“go  ahead.  try  it.  i  don't  care  if  you  are  knocked  up,  i'll  rip  your  throat  out,”  says 

johanna. 

i know i can't kill her right now. but it's just a matter of time with johanna and me. before 

one of us offs the other. 

“maybe we all had better be careful where we step,” says finnick, shooting me a look. he 
takes the coil and sets it on beetee's chest. “there's your wire, volts. watch where you

a. so i follow finnick about fifteen yards into the jungle, where he finds a good 
tree and starts stabbing to make a hole with his knife. 

as i stand there, weapons ready, i can't lose the uneasy feeling that something is going on 
and that it has to do with peeta. i retrace our steps, starting from the moment the gong rang 
out, searching  for the source of  my discomfort. finnick towing peeta in off  his  metal plate. 
finnick  reviving  peeta  after the  force  field  stopped  his  heart.  mags  running  into the  fog  so 
that  finnick  could  carry  peeta.  the  morphling  hurling  herself  in  front  of  him  to  block  the 
monkey's  attack. the  fight with the careers was  so quick,  but didn't finnick  block brutus's 
spear  from  hitting peeta even though  it  meant taking enobaria's knife  in  his  leg?  and  even 
now johanna has him drawing a map on a leaf rather than risking the jungle... 

there  is  no  question  about  it.  for  reasons  completely  unfathomable  to  me,

l of water, i take 
it with a silent nod of thanks, knowing how much she would despise the pity in my voice. 

while  johanna  collects  water  and  my  arrows,  beetee  fiddles  with  his  wire,  and  finnick 

takes to the water. i need to clean up, too, but i stay in peeta's arms, still too shaken to move. 

“who did they use against finnick?” he asks. 

“somebody named annie,” i say. 

“must be annie cresta,” he says. 

“who?” i ask. 

“annie  cresta.  she  was  the  girl  mags  volunteered  for.  she  won  about  five  years  ago,” 

says peeta. 

that  would  have  been  the  summer  after  my  father  died,  when  i  first  began  feeding  my 
family, when my whole being was occupied with battling starvation. “i don't remember those 
games much,” i say. “was that the earthquake year?” 

“yeah. annie's the one who went mad when her district partner got beheaded. ran off by 
herself and hid. but an earthquake broke a dam and most of the arena got flooded.

 we are on the clock face again. 

finnick weaves yet another water basket and a net for fishing. i take a quick swim and put 
more  ointment  on  my  skin.  then  i  sit  at  the  edge  of  the  water,  cleaning  the  fish  finnick 
catches and watching the sun drop below the horizon. the bright moon is already on the rise, 
filling the arena with that strange twilight. we're about to settle down to our meal of raw fish 
when the anthem begins. and then the faces ... 

cashmere. gloss. wiress. mags. the woman from district 5. the morphling who gave her 

life for peeta. blight. the man from 10. 

eight dead. plus eight from the first night. two-thirds of us gone in a day and a half. that 

must be some kind of record. 

“they're  really  burning  through  us,”  says  johanna.  “who's  left?  besides  us  five  and 

district two?” asks finnick. 

“chaff,” says peeta, without needing to think about it. perhaps  he's been keeping an eye 

out for him because of haymitch.
