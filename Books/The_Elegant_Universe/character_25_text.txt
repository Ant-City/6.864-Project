uld now seek—with unbridled vigor—an understanding of what these curled-up dimensions look
like.

what do the curled-up dimensions look like?

the extra spatial dimensions of string theory cannot be "crumpled" up any which way; the equations
that emerge from the theory severely restrict the geometrical form that they can take. in 1984, philip
candelas  of  the  university  of  texas  at  austin,  gary  horowitz  and  andrew  strominger  of  the
university of california at santa barbara, and edward witten showed that a particular class of six-
dimensional geometrical shapes can meet these conditions. they are known as calabi-yau spaces (or
calabi-yau  shapes)  in  honor  of  two  mathematicians,  eugenio  calabi  from  the  university  of
pennsylvania and shing-tung yau from harvard university, whose research in a related context, but
prior to string theory, plays a central role in understanding these spaces. although the mathematics
describing calabi-yau spaces is intricate and subtle, we can ge

tered. the history of science teaches us that
each time we think that we have it all figured out, nature has a radical surprise in store for us that
requires significant and sometimes drastic changes in how we think the world works. then again, in a
bit of brash posturing, we can also imagine, as others before us have perhaps naively done, that we
are living through a landmark period in humanity's history in which the search for the ultimate laws of
the universe will finally draw to a close. as edward witten has said,

i feel that we are so close with string theory that—in my moments of greatest optimism—i
imagine  that  any  day,  the  final  form  of  the  theory  might  drop  out  of  the  sky  and  land  in
someone's lap. but more realistically, i feel that we are now in the process of constructing
a much deeper theory than anything we have had before and that well into the twenty-first
century, when i am too old to have any useful thoughts on the subject, younger physicists
will have to dec
