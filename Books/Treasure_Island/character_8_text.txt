n swore at them again for their delay.

"search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and
get the chest," he cried.

i could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the
house must have shook with it. promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of
astonishment arose; the window of the captain's room was thrown open
with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the
moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the
road below him.

"pew," he cried, "they've been before us. someone's turned the chest out
alow and aloft."

"is it there?" roared pew.

"the money's there."

the blind man cursed the money.

"flint's fist, i mean," he cried.

"we don't see it here nohow," returned the man.

"here, you below there, is it on bill?" cried the blind man again.

at that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search
the captain's body, came to the door of the inn. "bill's been overhauled
a'ready," said he; "nothin' left."

"it's these people of the inn--it's that boy. i wish i had put his eyes
out!" cried the blind man, pew. "there were no time ago--they had the
door bolted when i tried it. scatter, lads, and find 'em."

"sure enough, they left their glim here," said the fellow from the
window.

"scatter and find 'em! rout the house out!" reiterated pew, striking
with his stick upon the road.

then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet
pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the
very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on
the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. and just
the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead
captain's money was once more clearly audible through the night,
but this time twice repeated. i had thought it

to be the blind man's
trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but i now found
that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its
effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.

"there's dirk again," said one. "twice! we'll have to budge, mates."

"budge, you skulk!" cried pew. "dirk was a fool and a coward from the
first--you wouldn't mind him. they must be close by; they can't be far;
you have your hands on it. scatter and look for them, dogs! oh, shiver
my soul," he cried, "if i had eyes!"

this appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began
to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, i thought,
and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest
stood irresolute on the road.

"you have your hands on thousands

be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it's here, and
you stand there skulking. there wasn't one of you dared face bill, and

poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when i might be rolling in a
coach! if you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch
them still."

"hang it, pew, we've got the doubloons!" grumbled one.

"they might have hid the blessed thing," said another. "take the
georges, pew, and don't stand here squalling."

squalling was the word for it; pew's anger rose so high at these
objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand,
he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded
heavily on more than one.

these, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him
in horrid terms, and tried in vain t

p.

this quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging,
another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the
hamlet--the tramp of horses galloping. almost at the same time a
pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. and that was
plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once
and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one
slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of
them remained but pew. him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic
or out of revenge for his ill words and blows i know not; but there he
remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping
and calling for his comrades. finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few
steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, "johnny, black dog, dirk,"
and other names, "you won't leave old pew, mates--not old pew!"

just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders
came in sight in the moonlight 
 
 ___________________________
 
and swept at full gallop down the slope.

at this pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for
the ditch, into which he rolled. but he was on his feet again in a
second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the
nearest of the coming horses.

the rider tried to save him, but in vain. down went pew with a cry that
rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him
and passed by. he fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face
and moved no more.

i leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. they were pulling up, at any
rate, horrified at the accident; and i soon saw what they were. one,
tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to
dr. livesey's; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the
way, and with whom he had had the inte

lligence to return at once. some
news of the lugger in kitt's hole had found its way to supervisor dance
and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance
my mother and i owed our preservation from death.

pew was dead, stone dead. as for my mother, when we had carried her up
to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her
back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still
continued to deplore the balance of the money. in the meantime the
supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to kitt's hole; but his men
had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes
supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was
no great matter

 he hailed her. a
voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get
some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his
arm. soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. mr. dance
stood there, as he said, "like a fish out of water," and all he could do
was to dispatch a man to b---- to warn the cutter. "and that," said he,
"is just about as good as nothing. they've got off clean, and there's
an end. only," he added, "i'm glad i trod on master pew's corns," for by
this time he had heard my story.

i went back with him to the admiral benbow, and you cannot imagine a
house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down
by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself;
and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain's
money-bag and a little silver from the till, i could see at once that we
were ruined. mr. dance could make nothing of the scene.

"they got the money, you say? well, then, haw

ose?"

"no, sir; not money, i think," replied i. "in fact, sir, i believe i
have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, i should
like to get it put in safety."

"to be sure, boy; quite right," said he. "i'll take it, if you like."

"i thought perhaps dr. livesey--" i began.

"perfectly right," he interrupted very cheerily, "perfectly right--a
gentleman and a magistrate. and, now i come to think of it, i might as
well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. master pew's
dead, when all's done; not that i regret it, but he's dead, you see, and
people will make it out against an officer of his majesty's revenue,
if make it out they can. now, i'll tell you, hawkins, if you like, i'll
take you along."

i thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet
where the horses were. by the time i had told mother of my purpose they
were all in the saddle.

"dogger," said mr. dance, "you have a good horse; take up this lad
behind you."

as soon as i was

seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling
as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the
shoulder for the more favoured of his guests.

now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of long john in
squire trelawney's letter i had taken a fear in my mind that he might
prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom i had watched for so long at
the old benbow. but one look at the man before me was enough. i had seen
the captain, and black dog, and the blind man, pew, and i thought i knew
what a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me,
from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.

i plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up
to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer.

"mr. silver, sir?" i asked, holding out the note.

"yes, my lad," said he; "such is my name, to be sure. and who may you
be?" and then as he saw the squire's letter, he seemed to me to give
something almost lik

and then, as morgan rolled back to his seat, silver added to me in a
confidential whisper that was very flattering, as i thought, "he's
quite an honest man, tom morgan, on'y stupid. and now," he ran on again,
aloud, "let's see--black dog? no, i don't know the name, not i. yet i
kind of think i've--yes, i've seen the swab. he used to come here with a
blind beggar, he used."

"that he did, you may be sure," said i. "i knew that blind man too. his
name was pew."

"it was!" cried silver, now quite excited. "pew! that were his name for
certain. ah, he looked a shark, he did! if we run down this black dog,
now, there'll be news for cap'n trelawney! ben's a good runner; few
seamen run better than ben. he should run him down, hand over hand, by
the powers! he talked o' keel-hauling, did he? i'll keel-haul him!"

all the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and
down the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving

it was silver's voice, and before i had heard a dozen words, i would
not have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and
listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen
words i understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended
upon me alone.

what i heard in the apple barrel

"no, not i," said silver. "flint was cap'n; i was quartermaster, along
of my timber leg. the same broadside i lost my leg, old pew lost his
deadlights. it was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me--out of
college and all--latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged
like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at corso castle. that
was roberts' men, that was, and comed of changing names to their
ships--royal fortune and so on. now, what a ship was christened, so let
her stay, i says. so it was with the cassandra, as brought us all safe
home from malabar, after england took the viceroy of the indies; so it
was with th

ilver. "i never sailed
along of him; first with england, then with flint, that's my story;
and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. i laid by nine
hundred safe, from england, and two thousand after flint. that ain't bad
for a man before the mast--all safe in bank. 'tain't earning now, it's
saving does it, you may lay to that. where's all england's men now? i
dunno. where's flint's? why, most on 'em aboard here, and glad to get
the duff--been begging before that, some on 'em. old pew, as had lost
his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in
a year, like a lord in parliament. where is he now? well, he's dead now
and under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers,
the man was starving! he begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and
starved at that, by the powers!"

"well, it ain't much use, after all," said the young seaman.

"'tain't much use for fools, you may lay to it--that, nor nothing,"
cried silver. "but now, you look here:

for i trust you, but it'd make jealousy among the mates."

"and can you trust your missis?" asked the other.

"gentlemen of fortune," returned the cook, "usually trusts little among
themselves, and right they are, you may lay to it. but i have a way with
me, i have. when a mate brings a slip on his cable--one as knows me, i
mean--it won't be in the same world with old john. there was some that
was feared of pew, and some that was feared of flint; but flint his own
self was feared of me. feared he was, and proud. they was the roughest
crew afloat, was flint's; the devil himself would have been feared to go
to sea with them. well now, i tell you, i'm not a boasting man, and you
seen yourself how easy i keep company, but when i was quartermaster,
lambs wasn't the word for flint's old buccaneers. ah, you may be sure of
yourself in old john's ship."

"well, i tell you now," replied the lad, "i didn't half

i know you. you'll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow, and go hang."

"everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling, john; but there's others
as could hand and steer as well as you," said israel. "they liked a bit
o' fun, they did. they wasn't so high and dry, nohow, but took their
fling, like jolly companions every one."

"so?" says silver. "well, and where are they now? pew was that sort,
and he died a beggar-man. flint was, and he died of rum at savannah. ah,
they was a sweet crew, they was! on'y, where are they?"

"but," asked dick, "when we do lay 'em athwart, what are we to do with
'em, anyhow?"

"there's the man for me!" cried the cook admiringly. "that's what i call
business. well, what would you think? put 'em ashore like maroons? that
would have been england's way. or cut 'em down like that much pork? that
would have been flint's, or billy bones's."
