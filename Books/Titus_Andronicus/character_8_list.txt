Chiron and Demetrius  - 
      
        Two Goth princes. Sons of Tamora. They squabble over who loves Lavinia more, when really they are merely guided by lust. They murder Bassianus and then brutally rape and disfigure Lavinia. They are shown in this play to be nothing more than engines of lust, destruction, and depravity, empty of even the basic wit that makes Aaron a more compelling villain. They are finally killed by Titus, who has their blood and bones made into a pastry to be fed to their mother.
