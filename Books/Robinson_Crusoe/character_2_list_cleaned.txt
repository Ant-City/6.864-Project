the [CHARACTER] - 
 the sea captain who picks up crusoe and the slave
boy xury from their boat after they escape from their moorish captors
and float down the african coast. the [CHARACTER] takes crusoe
to brazil and thus inaugurates crusoe's new life as plantation owner.
the [CHARACTER] is never named--unlike xury, for example--and
his anonymity suggests a certain uninteresting blandness in his
role in the novel. he is polite, personable, and extremely generous
to crusoe, buying the animal skins and the slave boy from crusoe
at well over market value. he is loyal as well, taking care of crusoe's
brazilian investments even after a twenty-eight-year absence. his role
in crusoe's life is crucial, since he both arranges for crusoe's
new career as a plantation owner and helps crusoe cash in on the
profits later.
