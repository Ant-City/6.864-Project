[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER], okonkwo's oldest son, struggles in the shadow of
his powerful, successful, and demanding father. his interests are
different from okonkwo's and resemble more closely those of unoka,
his grandfather. he undergoes many beatings, at a loss for how to please
his father, until the arrival of ikemefuna, who becomes like an older
brother and teaches him a gentler form of successful masculinity.
as a result, okonkwo backs off, and [CHARACTER] even starts to win his
grudging approval. [CHARACTER] remains conflicted, however: though he
makes a show of scorning feminine things in order to please his father,
he misses his mother's stories.
with the unconscionable murder of ikemefuna, however,
[CHARACTER] retreats into himself and finds himself forever changed. his
reluctance to accept okonkwo's masculine values turns into pure
embitterment toward him and his ways. when missionaries come to mbanta,
[CHARACTER]'s hope and faith are reawakened, and he eventually joins forces
with them. although okonkwo curses his lot for having borne so "effeminate"
a son and disowns [CHARACTER], [CHARACTER] appears to have found peace at last
in leaving the oppressive atmosphere of his father's tyranny.
