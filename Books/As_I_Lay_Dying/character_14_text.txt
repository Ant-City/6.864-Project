it goes round and round on the shining track. then the track goes shining 
round and round. 



"will what be there?" 
"that train. in the window." 

"you go to sleep. you can see tomorrow if it's there." 
maybe santa claus wont know they are town boys. 
"dewey dell." 

"you go to sleep. he aint going to let none of them town boys have it." 
it was behind the window, red on the track, the track shining round and 
round. it made my heart hurt and then it was pa and jewel and darl and mr 
gillespie's boy. mr gillespie's boy's legs come down under his nightshirt when 
he goes into the moon, his legs fuzz. they go on around the house toward the 
apple tree. 

"what are they going to do, dewey dell?" 

they went around the house toward the apple tree. 

"i can smell her," i say. "can you smell her, too?" 

"hush," dewey dell says. "the wind's changed. go to sleep." 

and so i am going to know where they stay at night soon. they come around 

the house, going across the yard in the moon, carr

ying her on their shoulders. 

they carry her down to the barn, the moon shining flat and quiet on her. then 

they come back and go into the house again. while they were in the moon, mr 

gillespie's boy's legs fuzzed. and then i waited and i said dewey dell? and then 

i waited and then i went to find where they stay at night and i saw something 

that dewey dell told me not to tell nobody. 

darl 

against the dark doorway he seems to materialise out of darkness, lean as a race 

horse in his underclothes in the beginning of the glare. he leaps to the ground 

with on his face an expression of furious unbelief. he has seen me without even 

turning his head or his eyes in which the glar

 says, leaping down the slope toward the barn. 

for an instant longer he runs silver in the moonlight, then he springs out 

like a flat figure cut leanly from tin against an abrupt and soundless explosion 

as the whole loft of the barn takes fire at once, as though it had been stuffed 

with powder. the front, the conical facade with the square orifice of doorway 

broken only by the square squat shape of the coffin on the sawhorses like a 

cubistic bug, conies into relief. behind me pa and gillespie and mack and dewey 

dell and vardaman emerge from the house. 

he pauses at the coffin, stooping, looking at me, his face furious. 

overhead the flames sound like thunder; across us rushes a cool draft: there is 

no heat in it at all yet, and a handful of chaff lifts suddenly and sucks 

swiftly along the stalls where a horse is screaming. "quick," i say; "the 

horses." 

he glares a moment longer at me, then at the roof overhead, then he leaps 
toward the stall where the horse screams. it

plunges and kicks, the sound of the 
crashing blows sucking up into the sound of the flames. they sound like an 
interminable train crossing an endless trestle. gillespie and mack pass me, in 
knee-length nightshirts, shouting, their voices thin and high and meaningless 
and at the same time profoundly wild and sad: ". . . cow . . . stall . . ." 
gillespie's nightshirt rushes ahead of him on the draft, ballooning about his 
hairy thighs. 

the stall door has swung shut. jewel thrusts it back with his buttocks and 

he appears, his back arched, the muscles ridged through his garment as he drags 



the horse out by its head. in the glare its eyes roll with soft, fleet, wild 
opaline fire; its muscles bunch and run as it flings its head about, lifting 
jewel clear of the ground. he drags it on, slowly, terrifically; again he gives 
me across his sh

oulder a single glare furious and brief. even when they are 
clear of the barn the horse continues to fight and lash backward toward the 
doorway until gillespie passes me, stark-naked, his nightshirt wrapped about the 
mule's head, and beats the maddened horse on out of the door. 
jewel returns, running; again he looks down at file coffin. but he comes 
on. "where's cow?" he cries, passing me. i follow him. in the stall mack is 
struggling with the other mule. when its head turns into the glare i can see the 
wild rolling of its eye too, but it makes no sound. it just stands there, 
watching mack over its shoulder, swinging its hind quarters toward him

o the end of her spine. 
jewel turns back into the barn. "here," i say; "jewel!" i grasp at him; he 
strikes my hand down. "you fool," i say, "dont you see you cant make it hack 
yonder?" the hallway looks like a searchlight turned into rain. "come on," i 
say, "around this way." 

when we are through the gap he begins to run. "jewel," i say, running. he 
darts around the corner. when i reach it he has almost reached the next one, 
running against the glare like that figure cut from tin. pa and gillespie and 
mack are some distance away, watching the barn, pink against the darkness where 
for the time the moonlight has been vanquished. "catch him!" i cry; "stop him!" 
when i reach the front, he is struggling with gillespie; the one lean in 
underclothes, the other stark naked. they are like two figures in a greek 
frieze, isolated out of all reality by the red glare. before i can reach them he 
has struck gillespie to the ground and turned and run back into the barn. 
the sound of it has become

and then cash was still awake. he turned his head from side to side, with 
sweat on his face. 

"do you want some more water on it, cash?" dewey dell said. 

cash's leg and foot turned black. we held the lamp and looked at cash's 

foot and leg where it was black. 

"your foot looks like a nigger's foot, cash," i said. "i reckon we'll have 
to bust it off," pa said. "what in the tarnation you put it on there for," mr 
gillespie said. 

"i thought it would steady it some," pa said. "i just aimed to help him." 

they got the flat iron and the hammer. dewey dell held the lamp. they had 

to hit it hard. and then cash went to sleep. 

"he's asleep now," i said. "it cant hurt him while he's asleep." 

it just cracked. it wouldn't come off. 

"it'll take the hide, too," mr gillespie said. "why in the tarnation you 
put it on there. didn't none of you think to grease his leg first?" 
"i just aimed to help him," pa said. "it

was darl put it on." 
"where is darl?" they said. 

"didn't none of you have more sense than that?" mr gillespie said. "i'd a 
thought he would, anyway." 

jewel was lying on his face. his back was red. dewey dell put the medicine 
on it. the medicine was made out of butter and soot, to draw out the fire. then 
his back was black. 

"does it hurt, jewel?" i said. "your back looks like a nigger's, jewel," i 

said. cash's foot and leg looked like a nigger's. then they broke it off. cash's 

leg bled. 

"you go on back and lay down," dewey dell said. "you ought to be asleep." 
"where is darl?" they said.

ave your cakes here?" i say. "we'll watch them." 

she descends steadily, not looking at us. 

"how would she know where to go if she waited till we get to town?" 
vardaman says. "where would you go to do it in town, dewey dell?" 
she lifts the package down and turns and disappears among the trees and 
undergrowth. 

"dont be no longer than you can help," pa says. "we aint got no time to 

waste." she does not answer. after a while we cannot hear her even. "we ought to 



done like armstid and gillespie said and sent word to town and had it dug and 
ready," he said. 

"why didn't you?" i say. "you could have telephoned." 

"what for?" jewel says. "who the hell cant dig a hole in the ground?" 

a car comes over the hill. it begins to sound the torn, slowing. it runs 

along the roadside in low gear, the outside wheels in the ditch, and passes us 

and goes on. vardaman watches it until it is out of sight. 

"how far is it now, darl?" he says. 

"not far," i say. 

"we ought to done it," pa says

gh the wagon has started 
again. "get in, jewel," i say. "come on. let's get away from here." but he does 
not get in. instead he sets his foot on the turning hub of the rear wheel, one 
hand grasping the stanchion, and with the hub turning smoothly under his sole he 
lifts the other foot and squats there, staring straight ahead, motionless, lean, 
wooden-backed, as though carved squatting out of the lean wood. 



cash 

it wasn't nothing else to do. it was either send him to jackson, or have 
gillespie sue us, because he knowed some way that darl set fire to it. i dont 
know how he knowed, but he did. vardaman see him do it, but he swore he never 
told nobody but dewey dell and that she told him not to tell nobody. but 
gillespie knowed it. but he would a suspicioned it sooner or later. he could 
have done it that night just watching the way darl acted. 
and so pa said, "i reckon there aint nothing else to do," and jewel said, 
"you want to fix him now?" 
"fix him?" pa said. 

"catch him and

ould want us all there," pa says. 

"let's take cash to the doctor first," darl said. "she'll wait. she's 
already waited nine days." 

"you all dont know," pa says. "the somebody you was young with and you 
growed old in her and she growed old in you, seeing the old coming on and it was 
the one somebody you could hear say it dont matter and know it was the truth 
outen the hard world and all a man's grief and trials. you all dont know." 
"we got the digging to do, too," i said. 

"armstid and gillespie both told you to send word ahead," darl said. "dont 
you want to go to peabody's now, cash?" 

"go on," i said. "it feels right easy now. it's best to get things done in 
the right place." 

"if it was just dug," pa says. "we forgot our spade, too." 

"yes," darl said. "i'll go to the hardware store. we'll have to buy one." 

"it'll cost money," pa says. 

"do you begrudge her it?" darl says. 

"go on and get a spade," jewel said. "here. give me the money." 
but pa didn't stop. "i reckon we can

you stepped in it. and then i always kind of had a idea that 

him and dewey dell kind of knowed things betwixt them. if i'd a said it was ere 

a one of us she liked better than ere a other, i'd a said it was darl. but when 

we got it filled and covered and drove out the gate and turned into the lane 

where them fellows was waiting, when they come out and come on him and he jerked 

back, it was dewey dell that was on him before even jewel could get at him. and 

then i believed i knowed how gillespie knowed about how his barn taken fire. 

she hadn't said a word, hadn't even looked at him, but when them fellows 

told him what they wanted and that they had come to get him and he throwed back, 

she jumped on him like a wild cat so that one of the fellows had to quit and 

hold her and her scratching and clawing at him like a wild cat, while the other 



one and pa and jewel throwed darl down and held him lying on his back, looking 
up at me. 

"i thought you would have told me," he said. "
