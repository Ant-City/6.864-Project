Dr. Valentini - 
                An
Italian surgeon who comes to the American hospital to contradict
the hospital's opinion that Henry must wait six months before having
an operation on his leg. In agreeing to perform surgery the next
morning, Dr. Valentini displays the kind of self-assurance and confidence
that Henry (and the novel) celebrates.
