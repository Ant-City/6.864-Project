nnot come to cressid but by pandar;
    and he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo
    as she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
    tell me, apollo, for thy daphne's love,
    what cressid is, what pandar, and what we?
    her bed is india; there she lies, a pearl;
    between our ilium and where she resides
    let it be call'd the wild and wand'ring flood;
    ourself the merchant, and this sailing pandar
    our doubtful hope, our convoy, and our bark.

  aeneas. how now, prince troilus! wherefore not afield?
  troilus. because not there. this woman's answer sorts,
    for womanish it is to be from thence.
    what news, aeneas, from the field to-day?
  aeneas. that paris is returned home, and hurt.
  troilus. by whom, aeneas?
  aeneas. troilus, by menelaus.
  troilus. let paris bleed: 'tis but a scar to scorn;
    paris is gor'd with menelaus' horn.
[alarum]
  aeneas. hark what good sport is out of town to-day!
  troilus. better

  alexander. queen hecuba and helen.
  cressida. and whither go they?
  alexander. up to the eastern tower,
    whose height commands as subject all the vale,

    here and see them as they pass toward ilium? good niece, do,
    sweet niece cressida.
  cressida. at your pleasure.
  pandarus. here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may see
    most bravely. i'll tell you them all by their names as they pass
    by; but mark troilus above the rest.

                       aeneas passes

  cressida. speak not so loud.
  pandarus. that's aeneas. is not that a brave man? he's one of the
    flowers of troy, i can tell you. but mark troilus; you shall see
    anon.

  pandarus. that's antenor. he has a shrewd wit, i can tell you; and
    he's a man good enough; he's one o' th' soundest judgments in
    troy, whosoever, and a proper man of person. when comes troilus?
    i'll show you troilus anon.

    so that the ram that batters down the wall,

  agamemnon. how?
  aeneas. ay;
    i ask, that i might waken reverence,
    and bid the cheek be ready with a blush
    modest as morning when she coldly eyes
    the youthful phoebus.
    which is that god in office, guiding men?
    which is the high and mighty agamemnon?
  agamemnon. this troyan scorns us, or the men of troy
    are ceremonious courtiers.
  aeneas. courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
    as bending angels; that's their fame in peace.
    but when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
    good arms, strong joints, true swords; and, jove's accord,
    nothing so full of heart. but peace, aeneas,
    peace, troyan; lay thy finger on thy lips.
    the worthiness of praise distains his worth,
    if that the prais'd himself bring the praise forth;
    but what the repining enemy commends,

  aeneas. sir, pardon; 'tis for agamemnon's ears.
  agamemnon. he hears nought privately that comes from troy.
  aeneas. nor i from troy come not to whisper with him;

    if none, he'll say in troy, when he retires,
    the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
    the splinter of a lance. even so much.
  agamemnon. this shall be told our lovers, lord aeneas.
    if none of them have soul in such a kind,
    we left them all at home. but we are soldiers;

    and formless ruin of oblivion;
    but in this extant moment, faith and troth,
    strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
    bids thee with most divine integrity,
    from heart of very heart, great hector, welcome.
  hector. i thank thee, most imperious agamemnon.
  agamemnon. [to troilus] my well-fam'd lord of troy, no less to you.
  menelaus. let me confirm my princely brother's greeting.
    you brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
  hector. who must we answer?
  aeneas. the noble menelaus.
  hector. o you, my lord? by mars his gauntlet, thanks!
    mock not that i affect the untraded oath;
    your quondam wife swears still by venus' glove.
    she's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
  menelaus. name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
  hector. o, pardon; i offend.
  nestor. i have, thou gallant troyan, seen thee oft,
    labouring for destiny, make cruel way
    through ranks of greekish youth; and i have seen thee,
    as hot as perse

    and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
    when that a ring of greeks have hemm'd thee in,
    like an olympian wrestling. this have i seen;
    but this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
    i never saw till now. i knew thy grandsire,
    and once fought with him. he was a soldier good,
    but, by great mars, the captain of us all,
    never like thee. o, let an old man embrace thee;
    and, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
  aeneas. 'tis the old nestor.
  hector. let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
    that hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time.
    most reverend nestor, i am glad to clasp thee.
  nestor. i would my arms could match thee in contention
    as they contend with thee in courtesy.
  hector. i would they could.
  nestor. ha!
    by this white beard, i'd fight with thee to-morrow.
    well, welcome, welcome! i have seen the time.

  cassandra. lay hold upon him, priam, hold him fast;
    he is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,
    thou on him leaning, and all troy on thee,
    fall all together.
  priam. come, hector, come, go back.
    thy wife hath dreamt; thy mother hath had visions;
    cassandra doth foresee; and i myself
    am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
    to tell thee that this day is ominous.
    therefore, come back.
  hector. aeneas is a-field;
    and i do stand engag'd to many greeks,
    even in the faith of valour, to appear
    this morning to them.
  priam. ay, but thou shalt not go.
  hector. i must not break my faith.
    you know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
    let me not shame respect; but give me leave
    to take that course by your consent and voice
    which you do here forbid me, royal priam.
