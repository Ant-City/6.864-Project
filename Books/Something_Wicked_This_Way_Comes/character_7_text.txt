u so sure lightning will strike anywhere around here?' said jim suddenly, his
eyes bright.
the salesman almost flinched. 'why, i got a nose, an eye, an ear.both those houses, their
timbers! listen!'
they listened. maybe their houses leaned under the cool afternoon wind. maybe not.

itching to let lightning pour through! tonight!'
'tonight?' jim sat up happily.
'no ordinary storm!' said the salesman. 'tom fury tells you. fury, ain't that a fine name for
one who sells lightning-rods? did i take the name? no! did the name fire me to my
occupations? yes! grown up, i saw cloudy fires jumping the world, making men hop and hide.
thought: i'll chart hurricanes, map storms, then run ahead shaking my iron cudgels, my
miraculous defenders, in my fists! i've shielded and made snug-safe one hundred thousand,
count 'em, god-fearing homes.so when i tell you, boys, you're in dire need, listen! climb that

'mama!' said the child.
the dwarf stopped and looked at the boy no bigger than himself. their eyes met.
will flung himself back, tried to gum his body into the concrete. he felt jim do the same, not
moving but moving his mind, his soul, thrusting it into darkness to hide from the little drama
above.
'come on, junior!' a woman's voice.
the boy was puffed up and away.
too late.
for the dwarf was looking down.
and in his eyes were the lost bits and fitful pieces of a man named fury who had sold
lightning-rods how many days how many years ago in the long, the easy, the safe and
wondrous time before this fright was born.
oh, mr fury, thought will, what they've done to you. threw you under a pile-driver, squashed
you in a steel press, squeezed the tears and screams out of you, trapped you in a jack-in-abox
all pressed down until there's nothing left of you, mr fury…nothing left but this…

think you're lying.you don't know the last names. now, why should you, a carnival stranger, lie
