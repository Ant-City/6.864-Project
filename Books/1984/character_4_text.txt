t martin's-in-the-fields it used to be called,' supplemented the old man,
'though i don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.'

winston did not buy the picture. it would have been an even more
incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry
home, unless it were taken out of its frame. but he lingered for some
minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not
weeks--as one might have gathered from the inscription over the
shop-front--but charrington. mr charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged
sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years. throughout that
time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never
quite got to the point of doing it. all the while that they were talking
the half-remembered rhyme kept running through winston's head. oranges and
lemons say the bells of st clement's, you owe me three farthings, say
the bells of st martin's! it was curious, but when you said it to yourself
you had t

he illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost london
that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. from one
ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. yet so
far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells
ringing.

he got away from mr charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not
to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of
the door. he had already made up his mind that after a suitable
interval--a month, say--he would take the risk of visiting the shop again.
it was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the centre.
the serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place,
after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the
shop could be trusted.

 however----!

yes, he thought again, he would come back. he would buy further scraps of
beautiful rubbish. he would buy the engraving of st clement danes, take
it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his
overalls. he would drag the rest of that poem out of mr charrington's
memory. even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed
momentarily through his mind again. for perhaps five seconds exaltation
made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much
as a preliminary glance through the window. he had even started humming
to an improvised tune

and in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust,
and with a twig from a pigeon's nest began drawing a map on the floor.




chapter 4



winston looked round the shabby little room above mr charrington's shop.
beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets and
a coverless bolster. the old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was
ticking away on the mantelpiece. in the corner, on the gateleg table, the
glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out
of the half-darkness.

in the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, and two cups,
provided by mr charrington. winston lit the burner and set a pan of water
to boil. he had brought an e

full of victory coffee and some
saccharine tablets. the clock's hands said seventeen-twenty: it was
nineteen-twenty really. she was coming at nineteen-thirty.

folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious, gratuitous, suicidal folly.
of all the crimes that a party member could commit, this one was the least
possible to conceal. actually the idea had first floated into his head in
the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface
of the gateleg table. as he had foreseen, mr charrington had made no
difficulty about letting the room. he was obviously glad of the few dollars
that it would bring him. nor did he seem shocked or become offensively
knowing when it was made clear that winston wanted the room for the purpose
of a love-affair. instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in
generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he
had become partly invisible. privacy, he said, was a very valuable thing.
everyone wanted a place where they could be

. he wished that they
were a married couple of ten years' standing. he wished that he were
walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly
and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the
household. he wished above all that they had some place where they could
be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time
they met. it was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the
following day, that the idea of renting mr charrington's room had occurred
to him. when he suggested it to julia she had agreed with unexpected
readiness. both of them knew that it was lunacy. it was as though they were
intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. as he sat waiting on the
edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the ministry of love.
it was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's
consciousness. there it lay, fixed in future times, preceding death as
surely as 99 precedes 100. one could not avoid it

ere'--she nodded at the engraving on the opposite
wall--'would that be a hundred years old?'

'more. two hundred, i dare say. one can't tell. it's impossible to discover
the age of anything nowadays.'

she went over to look at it. 'here's where that brute stuck his nose out,'
she said, kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture. 'what is
this place? i've seen it before somewhere.'

'it's a church, or at least it used to be. st clement danes its name was.'
the fragment of rhyme that mr charrington had taught him came back into
his head, and he added half-nostalgically: "oranges and lemons, say the
bells of st clement's!"

to his astonishment she capped the line:


  'you owe me three farthings, say the bells of st martin's,
  when will you pay me? say the bells of old bailey----'


'i can't remember how it goes on after that. but anyway i remember it ends
up, "here comes a candle to light you to bed, here comes a chopper to chop
off your head!"'

it was like the two halves of a countersi

gn. but there must be another
line after 'the bells of old bailey'. perhaps it could be dug out of
mr charrington's memory, if he were suitably prompted.

'who taught you that?' he said.

'my grandfather. he used to say it to me when i was a little girl. he was
vaporized when i was eight--at any rate, he disappeared. i wonder what a
lemon was,' she added inconsequently. 'i've seen oranges. they're a kind
of round yellow fruit with a thick skin.'

'i can remember lemons,' said winston. 'they were quite common in the
fifties. they were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell
them.'

'i bet that

l dozen children were blown to pieces. there were further angry
demonstrations, goldstein was burned in effigy, hundreds of copies of the
poster of the eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames, and
a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew round
that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and
an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their
house set on fire and perished of suffocation.

in the room over mr charrington's shop, when they could get there, julia
and winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window,
naked for the sake of coolness. the rat had never come back, but the bugs
had multiplied hideously in the heat. it did not seem to matter. dirty or
clean, the room was paradise. as soon as they arrived they would sprinkle
everything with pepper bought on the black market, tear off their clothes,
and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep and wake to find that
the bugs had ral

be intolerable, he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the
telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice. now that they had a
secure hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even seem a hardship that
they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time.
what mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist. to know
that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. the room
was a world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk.
mr charrington, thought winston, was another extinct animal. he usually
stopped to talk with mr charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs.
the old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors, and on the other
hand to have almost no customers. he led a ghostlike existence between the
tiny, dark shop, and an even tinier back kitchen where he prepared his
meals and which contained, among other things, an unbelievably ancient
gramophone with an enormous horn. he seemed glad of the opportunity to
talk. w

up her glass and sniff at
it with frank curiosity.

'it is called wine,' said o'brien with a faint smile. 'you will have read
about it in books, no doubt. not much of it gets to the outer party, i am
afraid.' his face grew solemn again, and he raised his glass: 'i think it
is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health. to our leader: to
emmanuel goldstein.'

winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness. wine was a thing he
had read and dreamed about. like the glass paperweight or mr charrington's
half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the
olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. for some reason
he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like
that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect. actually,
when he came to swallow it, the stuff was distinctly disappointing. the
truth was that after years of gin-drinking he could barely taste it. he
set down the empty glass.

'then there is such a person as goldst

o'brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat
white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue. it was important,
he said, not to go out smelling of wine: the lift attendants were very
observant. as soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget
her existence. he took another pace or two up and down, then stopped.

'there are details to be settled,' he said. 'i assume that you have a
hiding-place of some kind?'

winston explained about the room over mr charrington's shop.

'that will do for the moment. later we will arrange something else for you.
it is important to change one's hiding-place frequently. meanwhile i shall
send you a copy of the book'--even o'brien, winston noticed, seemed to
pronounce the words as though they were in italics--'goldstein's book, you
understand, as soon as possible. it may be some days before i can get hold
of one. there are not many in existence, as you can imagine. the thought

ized the allusion. 'and
in the meantime, is there anything that you wish to say before you leave?
any message? any question?.'

winston thought. there did not seem to be any further question that he
wanted to ask: still less did he feel any impulse to utter high-sounding
generalities. instead of anything directly connected with o'brien or the
brotherhood, there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the
dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days, and the little room
over mr charrington's shop, and the glass paperweight, and the steel
engraving in its rosewood frame. almost at random he said:

'did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins "oranges and lemons,
say the bells of st clement's"?'

again o'brien nodded. with a sort of grave courtesy he completed the
stanza:


  'oranges and lemons, say the bells of st clement's,
  you owe me three farthings, say the bells of st martin's,
  when will you pay me? say the bells of old bailey,
  when i grow rich, say the bells o

ted his shoulders, the pavement tickled
his feet, even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made
his joints creak.

he had worked more than ninety hours in five days. so had everyone else in
the ministry. now it was all over, and he had literally nothing to do, no
party work of any description, until tomorrow morning. he could spend six
hours in the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. slowly, in
mild afternoon sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the direction
of mr charrington's shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols, but
irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone
interfering with him. the heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped
against his knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and down
the skin of his leg. inside it was the book, which he had now had in his
possession for six days and had not yet opened, nor even looked at.

ence that the war with eurasia had ever happened. at twelve hundred it
was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the ministry were free till
tomorrow morning. winston, still carrying the brief-case containing the
book, which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his
body while he slept, went home, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in
his bath, although the water was barely more than tepid.

with a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above
mr charrington's shop. he was tired, but not sleepy any longer. he opened
the window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for
coffee. julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book. he
sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case.

a heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the
cover. the print also looked slightly irregular. the pages were worn at
the edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had passed through

the drivelling song seemed to have kept its popularity. you still heard it
all over the place. it had outlived the hate song. julia woke at the
sound, stretched herself luxuriously, and got out of bed.

'i'm hungry,' she said. 'let's make some more coffee. damn! the stove's
gone out and the water's cold.' she picked the stove up and shook it.
'there's no oil in it.'

'we can get some from old charrington, i expect.'

'the funny thing is i made sure it was full. i'm going to put my clothes
on,' she added. 'it seems to have got colder.'

winston also got up and dressed himself. the indefatigable voice sang on:


  'they sye that time 'eals all things,
  they sye you can always forget;
  but the smiles an' the tears acrorss the years
  they twist my 'eart-strings yet!'


as he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled across to the window.
the sun must have gone down behind the houses; it was

 necessary to be able to breathe. then two of the men hoisted her
up by knees and shoulders, and carried her out of the room like a sack.
winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow and contorted, with
the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek; and that
was the last he saw of her.

he stood dead still. no one had hit him yet. thoughts which came of their
own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit through his
mind. he wondered whether they had got mr charrington. he wondered what
they had done to the woman in the yard. he noticed that he badly wanted
to urinate, and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or
three hours ago. he noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine,
meaning twenty-one. but the light seemed too strong. would not the light
be fading at twenty-one hours on an august evening? he wondered whether
after all he and julia had mistaken the time--had slept the clock round
and thought it was twenty-thirty when really

it was nought eight-thirty

it was not interesting.

there was another, lighter step in the passage. mr charrington came into
the room. the demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly became more
subdued. something had also changed in mr charrington's appearance. his
eye fell on the fragments of the glass paperweight.

'pick up those pieces,' he said sharply.

a man stooped to obey. the cockney accent had disappeared; winston suddenly
realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few moments ago on the
telescreen. mr charrington was still wearing his old velvet jacket, but
his hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. also he was not
wearing his spectacles. he gave winston a single sharp glance, as though
verifying his identit

either; he was looking only at the dials.

he was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre wide, full of glorious,
golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out confessions at the
top of his voice. he was confessing everything, even the things he had
succeeded in holding back under the torture. he was relating the entire
history of his life to an audience who knew it already. with him were the
guards, the other questioners, the men in white coats, o'brien, julia,
mr charrington, all rolling down the corridor together and shouting with
laughter. some dreadful thing which had lain embedded in the future had
somehow been skipped over and had not happened. everything was all right,
there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was laid bare,
understood, forgiven.

he was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had
heard o'brien's voice. all through his interrogation, although he had
never seen him, he had had the feeling that o'brien was at his
