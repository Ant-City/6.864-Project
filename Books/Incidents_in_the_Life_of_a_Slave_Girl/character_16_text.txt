 too spirited a boy to stand that, and he went off. being desirous to do something to support himself, and having no one to advise him, he shipped for a whaling voyage. when i received these tidings i shed many tears, and bitterly reproached myself for having left him so long. but i had done it for the best, and now all i could do was to pray to the heavenly father to guide and protect him.

        not long after my return, i received the following letter from miss emily flint, now mrs. dodge:â€”

        "in this you will recognize the hand of your friend and mistress. having heard that you had gone with a family to europe, i have waited to hear of your return to write to you. i should have answered the letter you wrote to me long since, but as i could not then act independently of my father, i knew there could be nothing done satisfactory to you. there were persons here who were willing to buy you and run the risk of getting you. to this i would not consent. i have always been att

rd to lose so valuable a slave as i was.

        i kept close watch of the newspapers for arrivals; but one saturday night, being much occupied, i forgot to examine the evening express as usual. i went down into the parlor for it, early in the morning, and found the boy about to kindle a fire with it. i took it from him and examined the list of arrivals. reader, if you have never been a slave, you cannot imagine the acute sensation of suffering at my heart, when i read the names of mr. and mrs. dodge, at a hotel in courtland street. it was a third-rate hotel, and that circumstance convinced me of the truth of what i had heard, that they were short of funds and had need of my value, as they valued me; and that was by dollars and cents. i hastened with the paper to mrs. bruce. her heart and hand were always open to every one in distress, and she always warmly sympathized with mine. it was impossible to tell how near the enemy was. he might have passed and repassed the house while we were slee

 of arrivals. it was not long after mrs. bruce's return to her house, before several people came to inquire for me. one inquired for me, another asked for my daughter ellen, and another said he had a letter from my grandmother, which he was requested to deliver in person.

        they were told, "she has lived here, but she has left."

        "how long ago?"

        "i don't know, sir."

        "do you know where she went?"

        "i do not, sir." and the door was closed.

        this mr. dodge, who claimed me as his property, was originally a yankee pedler in the south; then he became a merchant, and finally a slaveholder. he managed to get introduced into what was called the first society, and married miss emily flint. a quarrel arose between him and her brother, and the brother cowhided him. this led to a family feud, and he proposed to remove to virginia. dr. flint left him no property, and his own means had become circumscribed, while a wife and children depended upon him for sup

port. under these circumstances, it was very natural that he should make an effort to put me into his pocket.

        i had a colored friend, a man from my native place, in whom i had the most implicit confidence. i sent for him, and told him that mr. and mrs. dodge had arrived in new york. i proposed that he should call upon them to make inquiries about his friends at the south, with whom dr. flint's family were well acquainted. he thought there was no impropriety in his doing so, and he consented. he went to the hotel, and knocked at the door of mr. dodge's room, which was opened by the gentleman himself, who gruffly inquired, "what brought you here? how came you to know i was in the city?"

        "your arrival was published in the evening papers, sir;

 and i called to ask mrs. dodge about my friends at home. i didn't suppose it would give any offence."

        "where's that negro girl, that belongs to my wife?"

        "what girl, sir?"

        "you know well enough. i mean linda, that ran away from dr. flint's plantation, some years ago. i dare say you've seen her, and know where she is."

        "yes, sir, i've seen her, and know where she is. she is out of your reach, sir."

        "tell me where she is, or bring her to me, and i will give her a chance to buy her f

        "i don't think it would be of any use, sir. i have heard her say she would go to the ends of the earth, rather than pay any man or woman for her freedom, because she thinks she has a right to it. besides, she couldn't do it, if she would, for she has spent her earnings to educate her children."

        this made mr. dodge very angry, and some high words passed between them. my friend was afraid to

come where i was; but in the course of the day i received a note from him. i supposed they had not come from the south, in the winter, for a pleasure excursion; and now the nature of their business was very plain.

        mrs. bruce came to me and entreated me to leave the city the next morning. she said her house was watched, and it was possible that some clew to me might be obtained. i refused to take her

        i had been told that mr. dodge said his wife had never signed away her right to my children, and if he could not get me, he would take them. this it was, more

than any thing else, that roused such a tempest in my soul. benjamin was with his uncle william in california, but my innocent young daughter had come to spend a vacation with me. i thought of what i had suffered in slavery at her age, and my heart was like a tiger's when a hunter tries to seize her young.

slavery; that such a great obligation could not be easily cancelled; and that i preferred to go to my brother in california.

        without my knowledge, mrs. bruce employed a gentleman in new york to enter into negotiations with mr. dodge. he proposed to pay three hundred dollars down, if mr. dodge would sell me, and enter into obligations to relinquish all claim to me or my children forever after. he who called himself my master said he scorned so small an offer for such a valuable servant. the gentleman replied, "you can do as you choose, sir. if you reject this offer you will never get any thing; for the woman has friends who will convey her and her children out of the country."

        mr. dodge concluded that "half a loaf

        my brain reeled as i read these lines. a gentleman near me said, "it's true; i have seen the bill of sale." "the bill of sale!" those words struck me like a blow. so i was sold at last! a human being sold in the free city of new york! the bill of sale is on record, and future generations will learn from it that women were articles of traffic in new york, late in the nineteenth century of the christian religion. it may hereafte

 i do not like to look upon it. i am deeply grateful to the generous friend who procured it, but i despise the miscreant who demanded payment for what never rightfully belonged to him or his.

        i had objected to having my freedom bought, yet i must confess that when it was done i felt as if a heavy load had been lifted from my weary shoulders. when i rode home in the cars i was no longer afraid to unveil my face and look at people as they passed. i should have been glad to have met daniel dodge himself; to have had him seen me and known me, that he might have mourned over the untoward circumstances which compelled him to sell me for three hundred dollars.

        when i reached home, the arms of my benefactress were thrown round me, and our tears mingled. as soon as she could speak, she said, "o linda, i'm so glad it's all over! you wrote to me as if you thought you were going to be transferred from one owner to another. but i did not buy you for your services. i should have done jus
