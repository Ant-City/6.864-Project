"there is a dragon marked in red on the mountain, said balin, "but it will be easy enough 
to find him without that, if ever we arrive there." 
"there is one point that you haven't noticed," said the wizard, "and that is the secret 
entrance. you see that rune on the west side, and the hand pointing to it from the other 
runes? that marks a hidden passage to the lower halls. 
"it may have been secret once," said thorin, "but how do we know that it is secret any 
longer? old smaug had lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to 
know about those caves." 
"he may-but he can't have used it for years and years. "why?" 
"because it is too small. 'five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' say the 
runes, but smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young 
dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men of dale." 
"it seems a great big hole to me," squeaked bilbo (who had no experience of dragons

though they usually have a good notion of the current market value; and they can't make 
a thing for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armour. there were 
lots of dragons in the north in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up 
there, with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and 
destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse. there was a most specially 
greedy, strong and wicked worm called smaug. one day he flew up into the air and 
came south. the first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the north, 
and the pine-trees on the mountain creaking and cracking in the wind. some of the 
dwarves who happened to be outside (i was one luckily -a fine adventurous lad in those 
days, always wandering about, and it saved my life that day)-well, from a good way off 
we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. then he came down the 
slopes and when he reached

agons' way, he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it 
for a bed. later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to dale, and 
carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until dale was ruined, and all the people 
dead or gone. what goes on there now i don't know for certain, but i don't suppose 
anyone lives nearer to the mountain than the far edge of the long lake now-a-days. 
"the few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed smaug; and 
there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards. 
they looked very grim but they said very little. when i asked how they had got away, 
they told me to hold my tongue, and said that one day in the proper time i should know. 
after that we went away, and we have had to earn our livings as best we could up and 
down the lands, often enough sinking as low as blacksmith-work or even coalmining. but 
we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. and even now

"is that the mountain?" asked bilbo in a solemn voice, looking at it with round eyes. he 
had never seen a thing that looked so big before. 
"of course not!" said balin. "that is only the beginning of the misty mountains, and we 
have to get through, or over, or under those somehow, before we can come into 

wilderland beyond. and it is a deal of a way even from the other side of them to the 
lonely mountain in the east where smaug lies on our treasure." 
"o!" said bilbo, and just at that moment he felt more fared than he ever remembered 
feeling before. he was thinking once again of his comfortable chair before the fire in his 
favourite sitting-room in his hobbit-hole, and of the kettle singing. not for the last time! 
now gandalf led the way. "we must not miss the road, or we shall be done for," he said. 
"we need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safetyalso it is very necessary to 
tackle the misty mountains

quickly grew fat and strong again. 
indeed within a week they were quite recovered, fitted out in fine cloth of their proper 
colours, with beards combed and trimmed, and proud steps. thorin looked and walked 
as if his kingdom was already regained and smaug chopped up into little pieces. 
then, as he had said, the dwarves' good feeling towards the little hobbit grew stronger 
every day. there were no more groans or grumbles. they drank his health, and they 
patted him on the back, and they made a great fuss of him; which was just as well, for he 
was not feeling particularly cheerful. he had not forgotten the look of the mountain, nor 
the thought of the dragon, and he had besides a shocking cold. for three days he

baggins remained a bit of a mystery. in any case the king knew now the dwarves' 
errand, or thought he did, and he said to himself: 
"very well! we'll see! no treasure will come back through mirkwood without my having 
something to say in the matter. but i expect they will all come to a bad end, and serve 
them right!" he at any rate did not believe in dwarves fighting and killing dragons like 
smaug, and he strongly suspected attempted burglary or something like it which shows 
he was a wise elf and wiser than the men of the town, though not quite right, as we shall 
see in the end. he sent out his spies about the shores of the lake and as far northward 
towards the mountains as they would go, and waited.

elay. so he spoke to the master and his councillors and said that soon he and his 
company must go on towards the mountain. 
then for the first time the master was surprised and a little frightened; and he wondered 
if thorin was after all really a descendant of the old kings. 
he had never thought that the dwarves would actually dare to approach smaug, but 
believed they were frauds who would sooner or later be discovered and be turned out. 
he was wrong. thorin, of course, was really the grandson of the king under the 
mountain, and there is no knowing what a dwarf will not dare and do for revenge or the 
recovery of his own. but the master was not sorry at all to let them go. they were

end of the tunnel, an opening of much the same size and shape as the door above. 
through it peeps the hobbit's little head. before him lies the great bottommost cellar or 
dungeon-hall of the ancient dwarves right at the mountain's root. it is almost dark so that 
its vastaess can only be dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor 
there is a great glow. the glow of smaug! 
there he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast asleep; thrumming came from his jaws and 
nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were low in slumber. 
beneath him, under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail, and about him on all sides 
stretching away across the unseen floors, lay countless piles of precious things, gold 
wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver redstained in the ruddy light. 

smaug lay, with wings folded like an immeasurable bat, turned partly on one side, so

with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; and he gazed motionless, 
almost forgetting the frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and count. 
he gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against his will, he stole from 
the shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the nearest edge of the mounds of 
treasure. above him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace even in his sleep. he 
grasped a great two-handled cup, as heavy as he could carry, and cast one fearful eye 
upwards. smaug stirred a wing, opened a claw, the rumble of his snoring changed its 
note. 
then bilbo fled. but the dragon did not wake-not yet but shifted into other dreams of 
greed and violence, lying there in his stolen hall while the little hobbit toiled back up the 
long tunnel. his heart was beating and a more fevered shaking was in his legs than 
when he was going down, but still he clutched the cup, and his chief thought was: "i've 
done it! this will show them. 'more like a grocer than a burglar' i

ure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the mountain 
underneath as if it was an old volcano that had made up its mind to start eruptions once 
again. the door behind them was pulled nearly to, and blocked from closing with a 
stone, but up the long tunnel came the dreadful echoes, from far down in the depths, of 
a bellowing and a trampling that made the ground beneath them tremble. 
then the dwarves forgot their joy and their confident boasts of a moment before and 
cowered down in fright. smaug was still to be reckoned with. it does not do to leave a 
live dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him. dragons may not have much 
real use for all their wealth, but they know it to an ounce as a rule, especially after long 
possession; and smaug was no exception. he had passed from an uneasy dream (in 
which a warrior, altogether insignificant in size but provided with a bitter sword and great 
courage, figured most unpleasantly) to a doze, and from a doze to wide waking. there

"they will be slain, and all our ponies too, and all out stores lost," moaned the others.

get inside mr. baggins and balin, and you two fili and kili-the dragon shan't have all of 
us. now you others, where are the ropes? be quick!" 
those were perhaps the worst moments they had been through yet. the horrible sounds 
of smaug's anger were echoing in the stony hollows far above; at any moment he might 
come blazing down or fly whirling round and find them there, near the perilous cliff's 
edge hauling madly on the ropes. up came bofur, and still all was safe. up came 
bombur, puffing and blowing while the ropes creaked, and still all was safe. up came 
some tools and bundles of stores, and then danger was upon them. a whirring noise 
was heard. a red light touched the points of standing rocks. the dragon came. they h

barely time to fly back to the tunnel, pulling and dragging in their bundles, when smaug 
came hurtling from the north, licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating his great 
wings with a noise like a roaring wind. his hot breath shrivelled the grass before the 
door, and drove in through the crack they had left and scorched them as they lay hid. 
flickering fires leaped up and black rockshadows danced. then darkness fell as he 
passed again. 
the ponies screamed with terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off. the dragon 
swooped and turned to pursue them, and was gone.

"that'll be the end of our poor beasts!" said thorin. 
"nothing can escape smaug once he sees it. here we are and here we shall have to 
stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long open miles back to the river with smaug 
on the watch!" 
it was not a pleasant thought! they crept further down the tunnel, and there they lay and 
shivered though it was warm and stuffy, until dawn came pale through the crack of the 
door. every now and again through the night they could hear the roar of the flying 
dragon grow and then pass and fade, as he hunted round and round the mountain-sides. 
he guessed from the ponies, and from the traces of the camps he had discovered, that 
men had come up from the river and the lake and

eft, not if a thousand years turned him to 
smouldering stone, but he could afford to wait. slow and silent he crept back to his lair 
and half closed his eyes. 
when morning came the terror of the dwarves grew less. they realized that dangers of 
this kind were inevitable in dealing with such a guardian, and that it was no good giving 
up their quest yet. nor could they get away just now, as thorin had pointed out. their 
ponies were lost or killed, and they would have to wait some time before smaug relaxed 
his watch sufficiently for them to dare the long way on foot. luckily they had saved 
enough of their stores to last them still for some time. 
they debated long on what was to be done, but they could think of no way of getting rid 
of smaug - which had always been a weak point in their plans, as bilbo felt inclined to 
point out. then as is the nature of folk that are thoroughly perplexed, they began to 
grumble at the hobbit, blaming him for what had at first so pleased them: for bri

away a cup and stirring up smaug's wrath so soon. 
"what else do you suppose a burglar is to do?" asked bilbo angrily. "i was not engaged 
to kill dragons, that is warrior's work, but to steal treasure. i made the best beginning i 
could. did you expect me to trot back with the whole hoard of thror on my back? if there 
is any grumbling to be done, i think i might have a say. you ought to have brought five 
hundred burglars not one. i am sure it reflects great credit on your grandfather, but you

ade the vast extent of his wealth clear to me. i should 
want hundreds of years to bring it all up, if i was fifty times as big, and smaug as tame 
as a rabbit." 
after that of course the dwarves begged his pardon. 
"what then do you propose we should do, mr. baggins?" asked thorin politely. 
"i have no idea at the moment - if you mean about removing the treasure. 
that obviously depends entirely on some new turn of luck and the getting rid of smaug. 
getting rid of dragons is not at all in my line, but i will do my best to think about it. 
personally i have no hopes at all, and wish i was safe back at home." 
"never mind that for the moment! what are we to do now, to-day?" 
"well, if you really want my advice, i should say we can do nothing but stay where we 
are. by day we can no doubt creep out safely enough to take the air. perhaps before 
long one or two could be chosen to go back to the store by the river and replenish our 
supplies.

 but in the meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside the tunnel by night. 
"now i will make you an offer. i have got my ring and will creep down this very noon-then 
if ever smaug ought to be napping-and see what he is up to. perhaps something will 
turn up. 'every worm has his weak spot,' as my father used to say, though i am sure it 
was not from personal experience." 
naturally the dwarves accepted the offer eagerly. already they had come to respect little 
bilbo. now he had become the real leader in their adventure. 
he had begun to have ideas and plans of his own. when midday came he got ready for 
another journey down into the mountain. he did not like it of course

 more about 
dragons and their wily ways, he might have teen more frightened and less hopeful of 
catching this one napping. 
the sun was shining when he started, but it was as dark as night in the tunnel. the light 
from the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went down. so silent was his going that 
smoke on a gentle wind could hardly have surpasses it, and he was inclined to feel a bit 
proud of himself as he drew near the lower door. there was only the very fainter glow to 
be seen. 
"old smaug is weary and asleep," he thought. "he can't, see me and he won't hear me. 
cheer up bilbo!" he had forgotten or had never heard about dragons' sense of smell. 

it is also an awkward fact that they keep half an eye open watching while they sleep, if 
they are suspicious. smaug certainly looked fast asleep, almost dead and dark, with 
scarcely a snore more than a whiff of unseen steam, when bilbo peeped once more from 
the entrance. he was just about to step out on to the floor when he caught a

pretending to sleep! he was watching the tunnel entrance! hurriedly bilbo stepped back 
and blessed the luck of his ring. then smaug spoke. 
"well, thief! i smell you and i feel your air. i hear your breath. come along! help yourself 
again, there is plenty and to spare!" 
but bilbo was not quite so unlearned in dragon-lore as all that, and if smaug hoped to 
get him to come nearer so easily he was disappointed. 
"no thank you, o smaug the. tremendous!" he replied. "i did not come for presents. i 
only wished to have a look at you and see if you were truly as great as tales say. i did 
not believe them." 
"do you now?" said the dragon somewhat flattered, even though he did not 
believe a word of it. 
"truly songs and tales fall utterly short of the reality, o smaug the chiefest and greatest 
of calamities," replied bilbo.

my name, but i don't seem to remember smelling you before. who are you and where do 
you come from, may i ask?" 
"you may indeed! i come from under the hill, and under hills and over the hills my paths 
led. and through the air, i am he that walks unseen." 
"so i can well believe," said smaug, "but that is hardly our usual name." 
"i am the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. i as chosen for the lucky number." 
"lovely titles!" sneered the dragon. "but lucky numbers don't always come off." 
"i am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them alive again from 
the water. i came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me." 
"these don't sound so creditable," scoffed smaug.

er; and i 
am barrel-rider," went on bilbo beginning to be pleased with his riddling. 
"that's better!" said smaug. "but don't let your imagination run away with you!" 
this of course is the way to talk to dragons, if you don't want to reveal your proper name 
(which is wise), and don't want to infuriate them by a flat refusal (which is also very 
wise). no dragon can resist the fascination of riddling talk and of wasting time trying to 
understand it. there was a lot here which smaug did not understand at all (though i 
expect you do, since you know all about bilbo's adventures to which he was referring), 
but he thought he understood enough, and he chuckled in his wicked inside. 
"i thought so last night," he smiled to himself. "lake-men, some nasty scheme of those 
miserable tub-trading lake-men, or i'm a lizard. i haven't been down that way for an age 
and an age; but i will soon alter that!" 
"very well, o barrel-rider!" he said aloud. "maybe barrel was your pony's name

maybe not, though it was fat enough. you may walk unseen, but you did not walk all the 
way. let me tell you i ate six ponies last night and i shall catch and eat all the others 
before long. in return for the excellent meal i will give you one piece of advice for your 
good: don't have more to do with dwarves than you can help!" 
"dwarves!" said bilbo in pretended surprise. 
"don't talk to me!" said smaug. "i know the smell (and taste) of dwarf-no one better. 
don't tell me that i can eat a dwarf-ridden pony and not know it! 
you'll come to a bad end, if you go with such friends. thief barrel-rider. i don't mind if 
you go back and tell them so from me." 

but he did not tell bilbo that there was one smell he could not make out at all, hobbit-
smell; it was quite outside his experience and puzzled him mightily. 
"i suppose you got a fair price for that cup last night?" he went on. 
"come now, d

skulking outside, and your job is to do all the dangerous work and get what you can 
when i'm not looking-for them? and you will get a fair share? 
don't you believe it! if you get off alive, you will be lucky." 
bilbo was now beginning to feel really uncomfortable. whenever smaug's roving eye, 
seeking for him in the shadows, flashed across him, he trembled, and an unaccountable 
desire seized hold of him to rush out and reveal himself and tell all the truth to smaug. in 
fact he was in grievous danger of coming under the dragon-spell. but plucking up 
courage he spoke again. 
"you don't know everything, o smaug the mighty," said he. "not gold alone brought us 
hither." 
"ha! ha! you admit the 'us'," laughed smaug. "why not say 'us fourteen' and be done 
with it. mr. lu

 in that case you may, perhaps, not altogether waste your time. 
"i don't know if it has occurred to you that, even if you could steal the gold bit by bit-a 
matter of a hundred years or so - you could not get it very far? not much use on the 
mountain-side? not much use in the forest? bless me! 
had you never thought of the catch? a fourteenth share, i suppose, or something like it, 
those were the terms, eh? but what about delivery? what about cartage? what about 
armed guards and tolls?" and smaug laughed aloud. he had a wicked and a wily heart, 
and he knew his guesses were not far out, though he suspected that the lake-men were 
at the back of the plans, and that most of the plunder was meant to stop there in the 
town by the shore that in his young days had been called esgaroth. 
you will hardly believe it, but poor bilbo was really very taken aback. 
so far all his. thoughts and energies had been concentrated on getting to the mountain 
and finding the entrance. he had never bothered

 to wonder how the treasure was to be 
removed, certainly never how any part of it that might fall to his share was to be brought 
back all the way to bag-end under-hill. 
now a nasty suspicion began to grow in his mind-had the dwarves forgotten this 
important point too, or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the time? that is the 
effect that dragon-talk has on the inexperienced. bilbo of course ought to have been on 
his guard; but smaug had rather an overwhelming personality. 
"i tell you," he said, in an effort to remain loyal to his friends and to keep his end up, "that 
gold was only an afterthought with us. we came over hill and under hill, by wave and 
win, for "revenge". surely, o smaug the unassessably wealthy, you must realize that 
your success has made you some bitter enemies?" 
then smaug really did laugh-a devastating sound which shook bilbo to the floor, while 
far up in the tunnel the dwarves huddled together and

"i have always understood," said bilbo in a frightened squeak, "that dragons were softer 
underneath, especially in the region of the-er-chest; but doubtless one so fortified has 
thought of that." 
the dragon stopped short in his boasting. "your information is antiquated," he snapped. 
"i am armoured above and below with iron scales and hard gems. no blade can pierce 
me." 
"i might have guessed it," said bilbo. "truly there can; nowhere be found the equal of 
lord smaug the impenetrable. what magnificence to possess a waistcoat of fine 
diamonds!" 
"yes, it is rare and wonderful, indeed," said smaug absurdly pleased. he did not know 
that the hobbit had already caught a glimpse of his peculiar under-covering on his 
previous visit, and was itching for a closer view for reasons of his own. the dragon rolled 
over. "look!" he said. "what do you say to that?" 
"dazzlingly marvellous! perfect! flawless! staggering!" exclaimed bilbo aloud, but what

as a parting shot, as he darted back and fled up the tunnel. 
it was an unfortunate remark, for the dragon spouted terrific flames after him, and fast 
though he sped up the slope, he had not gone nearly far enough to be comfortable 
before the ghastly head of smaug was thrust against the opening behind. luckily the 
whole head and jaws could not squeeze in, but the nostrils sent forth fire and vapour to 
pursue him, and he was nearly overcome, and stumbled blindly on in great pain and 
fear. he had been feeling rather pleased with the cleverness of his conversation with 
smaug, but his mistake at the end shook him into better sense. 
"never laugh at live dragons, bilbo you fool!" he said to himself, and it became a 
favourite saying of his later, and pass

y be in that direction. i wish to goodness i had 
never said that about barrel-rider; it would make even a blind rabbit in these parts think

"well, well! it cannot be helped, and it is difficult not to slip in talking to a dragon, or so i 
have always heard," said balin anxious to comfort him. "i think you did very well, if you 
ask me-you found out one very useful thing at any rate, and got home alive, and that is 
more than most can say who have had words with the likes of smaug. it may be a mercy 
and a blessing yet to know of the bare patch in the old worm's diamond waistcoat." 
that turned the conversation, and they all began discussing dragonslayings historical, 
dubious, and mythical, and the various sorts of stabs and jabs and undercuts, and the 
different arts, devices and stratagems by which they had been accomplished. the 
general opinion was that catching a dragon napping was not as easy as it sounded, and 
the attempt to stick one or prod one asleep was more

istened, till at last when the stars 
began to peep forth, it silently spread its wings and flew away. and all the while they

bits, if necessary, to stop up our entrance, and if we are smashed with it the better 
he will like it." 
"you are very gloomy, mr. baggins!" said thorin. "why has not smaug blocked the lower 
end, then, if he is so eager to keep us out? he has not, or we should have heard him." 
"i don't know, i don't know-because at first he wanted to try

 and lure me in again, i 
suppose, and now perhaps because he is waiting till after tonight's hunt, or because he 
does not want to damage his bedroom if he can help it - but i wish you would not argue. 
smaug will be coming out at any minute now, and our only hope is to get well in the 
tunnel and shut the door." 
he seemed so much in earnest that the dwarves at last did as he said, though they 
delayed shutting the door-it seemed a desperate plan, for no one knew whether or how 
they could get it open again from the inside, and the thought of being shut in a place 
from which the only way out led through the dragon's lair was not one they liked. also 
everything seemed quite quiet, both outside and

shut in the mountain! 
and not a moment too soon. they had hardly gone any distance down the tunnel when a 
blow smote the side of the mountain like the crash of batteringrams made of forest oaks 
and swung by giants. the rock boomed, the walls cracked and stones fell from the roof 
on their heads. what would have happened if the door had still been open i don't like to 
think. they fled further down the tunnel glad to be still alive, while behind them outside 
they heard the roar and rumble of smaug's fury. he was breaking rocks to pieces, 
smashing wall and cliff with the lashings of his huge tail, till their little lofty camping 
ground, the scorched grass, the thrush's stone, the snail-covered walls, the narrow 
ledge, and all disappeared in a jumble of smithereens, and an avalanche of splintered 
stones fell over the cliff into the valley below. 
smaug had left his lair in silent stealth, quietly soared into the air, and then floated heavy 
and slow in the dark like a monstrous crow, d

e still to darkness and to silence going on unbroken. at last after 
days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when they were becoming choked and dazed for 
want of air, they could bear it no longer. they would almost have welcomed sounds from 
below of the dragon's return. in the silence they feared some cunning devilry of his, but 
they could not sit there for ever. 
thorin spoke: "let us try the door!" he said. "i must feel the wind on my face soon or die. 
i think i would rather be smashed by smaug in the open than suffocate in here!" 
so several of the dwarves got up and groped back to where the door had been. but they 
found that the upper end of the tunnel had been shattered and blocked with broken rock. 
neither key nor the magic it had once obeyed would ever open that door again. 
"we are trapped!" they groaned. "this is the end. we shall die here." 
but somehow, just when the dwarves were most despairing, bilbo felt a strange 
lightening of the heart, as if a heavy weight had gone f

there's hope!" as my father used to say, and 
'third time pays for all.' i am going down the tunnel once again. i have been that way 
twice, when i knew there was a dragon at the other end, so i will risk a third visit when i 
am no longer sure. anyway the only way out is down. and i think time you had better all 
come with me." 
in desperation they agreed, and thorin was the first go forward by bilbo's side. 
"now do be careful!" whispered the hobbit, "and quiet as you can be! 
there may be no smaug at the bottom but then again there may be. don't let us take 
any unnecessary risks!" 
down, down they went. the dwarves could not, course, compare with the hobbit in real 
stealth, and the made a deal of puffing and shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly; 
but though every now and again bilbo in fear stopped and listened, not a sound stirred 
below near the bottom, as well as he could judge, bilbo slipped on his ring and went 
ahead. but he did not need it: the darkness was complete, and

 into the hall! 
there he lay face downwards on the floor and did no dare to get up, or hardly even to 
breathe. but nothing moved. there was not a gleam of lightunless, as seemed to him, 
when at last he slowly raised his head, there was a pale white glint, above him and far 
off in the gloom. but certainly it was not a spark of dragon-fire, though the wormstench 
was heavy in the place, and the taste of vapour was on his tongue. 
at length mr. baggins could bear it no longer. "come found you, smaug, you worm!" he 
squeaked aloud. "stop playing hide-and-seek! give me a light, and then eat me if you 
can catch me!" 

faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer. bilbo got up, and 
found that he did not know in what direction to turn. 
"now i wonder what on earth smaug is playing at," he said. "he is not at home today (or 
tonight, or whatever it is), i do believe. if oin and gloin have not lost their time tinder-
boxes, perhaps we can make a little light, and have a look

spark of his torch vanished from the sight of the watching dwarves. but soon they saw it 
far away in the distance again. bilbo was crossing the floor of the hall. 
he went on, until he came to the great doors at the further side, and there a draught of 
air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his light. he peeped timidly through and 
caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim beginnings of wide stairs going up 
into the gloom. and still there was no sight nor sound of smaug. he was just going to 

turn and go back, when a black shape swooped at him and brushed his face. he 
squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and fell. his torch dropped head downwards 
and went out! 
"only a bat, i suppose and hope!" he said miserably. but now what am i to do? which is 
east, south, north west?" 
"thorin! balin! oin! gloin! fill! kili!" he cried as loud he could-it seemed a thin little noise 
in the wide blackness. "the light's gone out! 
someone come and find and help me!"

ld them at that moment about the 
arkenstone, i don't know. the mere fleeting glimpses of treasure which they had caught 
as they went along had rekindled all the fire of their dwarvish hearts; and when the heart 
of a dwarf, even the most respectable, is wakened by gold and by jewels, he grows 
suddenly bold, and he may become fierce. 
the dwarves indeed no longer needed any urging. all were now eager to explore the hall 
while they had the chance, and willing to believe that, for the present, smaug was away 
from home. each now gripped a lighted torch; and as they gazed, first on one side and 
then on another, they forgot fear and even caution. they spoke aloud, and cried out to 
one another, as they lifted old treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them 
in the light caressing and fingering them. fili and kili were almost in merry mood, and 
finding still hanging there many golden harps strung with silver they took them and 
struck them; and being magical (and also untouched

ns kept his head more clear of the bewitchment of the hoard than 
the dwarves did. long before the dwarves were tired of examining the treasures he 
became wary of it and sat down on the floor; and he began to wonder nervously what 
the end of it all would be "i would give a good many of these precious goblets, thought, 
"for a drink of something cheering out of one beorn's wooden bowls!" 
"thorin!" he cried aloud. "what next? we are armed, but what good has any armour ever 
been before against smaug the dreadful? this treasure is not yet won back. we are not 
looking for gold yet, but for a way of escape; and we have tempted luck too long!" 
'"you speak the truth!" answered thorin, recovering his wits. "let us go! 
i will guide you. not in a thousand years should i forget the ways of this palace." then he 
hailed the others, and they gathered together, and holding their torches above their 
heads they passed through the gaping doors, not without many a backward glance of 
longing.

as. a bitter easterly breeze blew with a threat of oncoming winter. 
it swirled over and round the arms of the mountain into the valley, and sighed among the 
rocks. after their long time in the stewing depths of the dragonhaunted caverns, they 
shivered in the sun. suddenly bilbo realized that he was not only tired but also very 
hungry indeed. "it seems to be late morning," he said, "and so i suppose it is more or 
less breakfast-time - if there is any breakfast to have. but i don't feel that smaug's front 
doorstep is the safest place for a meal. do let's go somewhere where we can sit quiet for 
a bit!" 
"quite right!" said balin. "and i think i know which way we should go: we ought to make 
for the old look-out post at the southwest corner of the mountain." 
"how far is that?" asked the hobbit. 
"five hours march, i should think. it will be rough going. the road from the gate along 
the left edge of the stream seems all broken up. but look down there! the river loops

imeless hole?" 
as a matter of fact two nights and the day between had gone by (and not altogether 
without food) since the dragon smashed the magic door, but bilbo had quite lost count, 
and it might have been one night or a week of nights for all he could tell. 
"come, come!" said thorin laughing - his spirits had begun to rise again, and he rattled 
the precious stones in his pockets. "don't call my place a nasty hole! you wait till it has 
been cleaned and redecorated!" 
"that won't be till smaug's dead," said bilbo glumly. "in the meanwhile where is he? i 
would give a good breakfast to know. i hope he is not up on the mountain looking down 
at us!" 
that idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, and they quickly decided that bilbo and balin 
were right. 
"we must move away from here," said don. "i feel as if his eyes were on the back of my 
head." 
"it's a cold lonesome place," said bombur. "there may be drink, but i see no sign of 
food. a dragon would always be hungry in such parts."

ound the mountain. but there seemed small need for 
watching in the days of our prosperity, and the guards were made over comfortable, 
perhaps - otherwise we might have had longer warnings of the coming of the dragon, 
and things might have been different. 
still, "here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a while, and can see much without being 
seen." 
"not much use, if we have been seen coming here," said dori, who was always looking 
up towards the mountain's peak, as if he expected to see smaug perched there like a 
bird on a steeple. 
"we must take our chance of that," said thorin. "we can go no further today." 
"hear, hear!" cried bilbo, and flung himself on the ground. 
in the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there was a small 
chamber further in, more removed from the cold outside. it was quite deserted; not even 
wild animals seemed to have used it in all the days of smaug's dominion. there they laid 
their burdens; and some threw themselves down at once

 and slept, but the others sat 
near the outer door and discussed their plans. 
in all their talk they came perpetually back to one thing: where was smaug? they looked 
west and there was nothing, and east there was nothing, and in the south there was no 
sign of the dragon, but there was a gathering of very many birds. at that they gazed and 
wondered; but they were no nearer understanding it, when the first cold stars came out.

 dread. so it was that the dragon did not 
find them quite unprepared. before long, so great was his speed, they could see him as 
a spark of fire rushing towards them and growing ever huger and more bright, and not 
the most foolish doubted that the prophecies had gone rather wrong. still they had a little 
time. every vessel in the town was filled with water, every warrior was armed, every 
arrow and dart was ready, and the bridge to the land was thrown down and destroyed, 
before the roar of smaug's terrible approach grew loud, and the lake rippled red as fire 
beneath the awful beating of his wings. 
amid shrieks and wailing and the shouts of men he came over them, swept towards the 
bridges and was foiled! the bridge was gone, and his enemies were on an island in 
deep water-too deep and dark and cool for his liking. if he plunged into it, a vapour and a 
steam would arise enough to cover all the land with a mist for days; but the lake was 
mightier than he, it would quench him before

fire leaped from thatched roofs and wooden beam-ends as he hurtled down and past 
and round again, though all had been drenched with water before he came. once more 
water was flung by a hundred hands wherever a spark appeared. 
back swirled the dragon. a sweep of his tail and the roof of the great house crumbled 
and smashed down. flames unquenchable sprang high into the night. 
another swoop and another, and another house and then another sprang afire and fell; 
and still no arrow hindered smaug or hurt him more than a fly from the marshes. already 
men were jumping into the water on every side. women and children were being 
huddled into laden boats in the market-pool. weapons were flung down. there was 
mourning and weeping, where but a little time ago the old songs of mirth to come had 
been sung about the dwarves. now men cursed their names. the master himself was 
turning to his great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the confusion and save himself.

well!" 
the dragon swooped once more lower than ever, and as he turned and dived down his 
belly glittered white with sparkling fires of gems in the moon-but not in one place. the 
great bow twanged. the black arrow sped straight from the string, straight for the hollow 
by the left breast where the foreleg was flung wide. in it smote and vanished, barb, shaft 
and feather, so fierce was its flight. with a shriek that deafened men, felled trees and 
split stone, smaug shot spouting into the air, turned over and crashed down from on 
high in ruin. 
full on the town he fell. his last throes splintered it to sparks and gledes. the lake 
roared in. a vast steam leaped up, white in the sudden dark under the moon. there was 
a hiss, a gushing whirl, and then silence. and that was the end of smaug and esgaroth, 
but not of bard. the waxing moon rose higher and higher and the wind grew loud and 
cold. it twisted the white fog into bending pillars and hurrying clouds

esult of his words was 
that for the moment the people quite forgot their idea of a new king, and turned their 
angry thoughts towards thorin and his company. wild and bitter words were shouted 
from many sides; and some of those who had before sung the old songs loudest, were 
now heard as loudly crying that the dwarves had stirred the dragon up against them 
deliberately! 
"fools!" said bard. "why waste words and wrath on those unhappy creatures? 
doubtless they perished first in fire, before smaug came to us." 
then even as he was speaking, the thought came into his heart of the fabled treasure of 
the mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly silent. he thought of the 
master's words, and of dale rebuilt, and filled with golden bells, if he could but find the 
men. 
at length he spoke again: "this is no time for angry words. master, or for considering 
weighty plans of change. there is work to do. i serve you still-though after a while i may 
think again of your words

s name, and he had a hard task to govern the people and direct the preparations 
for their protection and housing. probably most of them would have perished in the 
winter that now hurried after autumn, if help had not been to hand. but help came swiftly; 
for bard at once had speedy messengers sent up the river to the forest to ask the aid of 
the king of the elves of the wood, and these messengers had found a host already on 
the move, although it was then only the third day after the fall of smaug. 
the elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the birds that 
loved his folk, and already knew much of what had happened. very great indeed was the 
commotion among all things with wings that dwelt on the borders of the desolation of the 
dragon. the air was filled with circling flocks, and their swift-flying messengers flew here 
and there across the sky. 
above the borders of the forest there was whistling, crying and piping. far over 
mirkwood tidings spread: "smaug is d

heir companies came flying from the 
south; and the crows that still lived about the mountain were wheeling and crying 
unceasingly above. 
"something strange is happening," said thorin. "the time has gone for the autumn 
wanderings; and these are birds that dwell always in the land; there are starlings and 
flocks of finches; and far off there are many carrion birds as if a battle were afoot!" 
suddenly bilbo pointed: "there is that old thrush again!" he cried. "he seems to have 
escaped, when smaug smashed the mountain-side, but i don't suppose the snails 
have!" 
sure enough the old thrush was there, and as bilbo pointed, he flew towards them and 
perched on a stone near by. then he fluttered his wings and sang; then he cocked his 
head on one side, as if to listen; and again he sang, and again he listened. 
"i believe he is trying to tell us something," said balin; "but i cannot follow the speech of 
such birds, it is very quick and difficult. can you make it out baggins?"

remember still the king that was of old. most of my people are abroad, for there are great 
tidings in the south - some are tidings of joy to you, and some you will not think so good. 
"behold! the birds are gathering back again to the mountain and to dale from south and 
east and west, for word has gone out that smaug is dead!" 
"dead! dead?" shouted the dwarves. "dead! then we have been in needless fear-and 
the treasure is ours!" 
they all sprang up and began to caper about for joy. 
"yes, dead," said rac. "the thrush, may his feathers never fall, saw him die, and we 
may trust his words. he saw him fall in battle with the men of esgaroth the third night 
back from now at the rising of the moon." 
it was some time before thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and listen to the 
raven's news. at length

easure is yours-for the moment. but many are gathering hither beside the birds. the 
news of the death of the guardian has already gone far and wide, and the legend of the 
wealth of thror has not lost in the telling during many years; many are eager for a share 
of the spoil. already a host of the elves is on the way, and carrion birds are with them 
hoping for battle and slaughter. by the lake men murmur that their sorrows are due to 
the dwarves; for they are homeless and many have died, and smaug has destroyed 
their town. they too think to find amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or 
dead. 
"your own wisdom must decide your course, but thirteen is small remnant of the great 
folk of durin that once dwelt here, and now are scattered far. if you will listen to my 
counsel, you will not trust the master of the lake-men, but rather him that shot the 
dragon with his bow. bard is he, of the race of dale, of the line of girion; he is a grim 
man but true. we would see peace once

his share of 
the profits for the peaceful winding up of these affairs. 
"back to the mountain!" cried the dwarves as if they had not heard him; so back he had 
to go with them. as you have heard some of the events already, you will see that the 
dwarves still had some days before them. they explored the caverns once more, and 
found, as they expected, that only the front gate remained open; all the other gates 
(except, of course, the small secret door) had long ago been broken and blocked by 
smaug, and no sign of them remained. 

so now they began to labour hard in fortifying the main entrance, and in remaking the 
road that led from it. tools were to be found in plenty that the miners and quarriers and 
builders of old had used; and at such work the dwarves were still very skilled. 
as they worked the ravens brought them constant tidings. in this way they learned that 
the elvenking had turned aside to the lake, and they still had a breathing space. better 
still, they heard that three

"who are you, and of what would you parley?" 
"i am bard, and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure delivered. is that not 
a matter that concerns you? moreover i am by right descent the heir of girion of dale, 
and in your hoard is mingled much of the wealth of his halls and town, which of old 
smaug stole. is not that a matter of which we may speak? further in his last battle 
smaug destroyed the dwellings of the men of esgaroth, and i am yet the servant of their 
master. i would speak for him and ask whether you have no thought for the sorrow and 

misery of his people. they aided you in your distress, and in recompense you have thus 
far brought ruin only, though doubtless undesigned." 
now these were fair words and true, if proudly and grimly spoken; and

on which a dragon has long brooded, 
nor with dwarvish hearts. long hours in the past days thorin had spent in the treasury, 
and the lust of it was heavy on him. though he had hunted chiefly for the arkenstone, 
yet he had an eye for many another wonderful thing that was lying there, about which 
were wound old memories of the labours and the sorrows of his race. 
"you put your worst cause last and in the chief place," thorin answered. 
"to the treasure of my people no man has a claim, because smaug who stole it from us 
also robbed him of life or home. the treasure was not his that his evil deeds should be 
amended with a share of it. the price of the goods and the assistance that we received 
of the lake-men we will fairly pay-in due time. but nothing will we give, not even a loaf's 
worth, under threat of force. while an armed host lies before our doors, we look on you

colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to win the dominion of the north. 
tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and in all the mountains there was a forging 
and an arming. 
then they marched and gathered by hill and valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark, 
until around and beneath the great mountain gundabad of the north, where was their 
capital, a vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares 
upon the south. then they learned of the death of smaug, and joy was in their hearts: 
and they hastened night after night through the mountains, and came thus at last on a 
sudden from the north hard on the heels of dain. not even the ravens knew of their 
coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the lonely mountain from 
the hills behind. how much gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is plain that he had not 
expected this sudden assault. 
this is the plan that he made in council with the elvenking and with bard; and with dain,

e if he was going to be in a last desperate 
stand, he preferred on the whole to defend the elvenking. gandalf, too, i may say, was 
there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought, preparing, i suppose, some last blast of 
magic before the end. 
that did not seem far off. "it will not be long now," thought bilbo, "before the goblins win 
the gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. really it is enough to 
make one weep, after all one has gone through. i would rather old smaug had been left 
with all the wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old 
bombur, and balin and fili and kili and all the rest come to a bad end; and bard too, and 
the lake-men and the merry elves. misery me! i have heard songs of many battles, and i 
have always understood that defeat may be glorious. it seems very uncomfortable, not 
to say distressing. i wish i was well out of it."
