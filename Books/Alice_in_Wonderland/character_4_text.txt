ertainly too much of it in the air. even the duchess
sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment’s pause. the only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on
the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

‘please would you tell me,’ said alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, ‘why
your cat grins like that?’

‘it’s a cheshire cat,’ said the duchess, ‘and that’s why. pig!’

she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,
and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--

‘i didn’t know that cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, i didn’t know
that cats could grin.’

‘they all can,’ said the duchess; ‘and most of ‘em do.’

‘i don’t know of any that do,’ alice said very politely, feeling quite

 absurd for her to carry it further.

so she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see
it trot away quietly into the wood. ‘if it had grown up,’ she said
to herself, ‘it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, i think.’ and she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, ‘if one only knew the right way to change them--’ when she
was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a
tree a few yards off.

the cat only grinned when it saw alice. it looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

‘cheshire puss,’ she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.
‘come, it’s pleased so far,’ thought alice, and she went on. ‘would you
tell me, please, which way i ought to g

at it might happen any minute,
‘and then,’ thought she, ‘what would become of me? they’re dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one
left alive!’

she was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance
in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it
a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself
‘it’s the cheshire cat: now i shall have somebody to talk to.’

‘how are you getting on?’ said the cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. ‘it’s no use
speaking to it,’ she thought, ‘till its ears have come, or at least one
of them.’ in another minute the whole head appeared, and then alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. the cat seemed to think that

 away when it saw mine coming!’

‘how do you like the queen?’ said the cat in a low voice.

‘not at all,’ said alice: ‘she’s so extremely--’ just then she noticed
that the queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
‘--likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.’

the queen smiled and passed on.

‘who are you talking to?’ said the king, going up to alice, and looking
at the cat’s head with great curiosity.

‘it’s a friend of mine--a cheshire cat,’ said alice: ‘allow me to
introduce it.’

‘i don’t like the look of it at all,’ said the king: ‘however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.’

‘i’d rather not,’ the cat remarked.

‘don’t be impertinent,’ said the king, ‘and don’t look at me like that!’
he got behind alice as he spoke.

‘a cat may look at a king,’ said alice. ‘i’ve read that in some book,
but i don’t remember where.’

‘well, it must be removed,’ said the king very decidedly, and he

her side of the garden, where alice could see it trying in a helpless
sort of way to fly up into a tree.

by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: ‘but it doesn’t
matter much,’ thought alice, ‘as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground.’ so she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.

when she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised to find quite a
large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the king, and the queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

the executioner’s argum
