two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the child,
while the other remained in my possession, i rang the bell, and fled
with all speed. a fortnight after i was at rogliano, and i said to
assunta,--‘console thyself, sister; israel is dead, but he is avenged.’
she demanded what i meant, and when i had told her all,--‘giovanni,’
said she, ‘you should have brought this child with you; we would have
replaced the parents it has lost, have called it benedetto, and then, in
consequence of this good action, god would have blessed us.’ in reply i
gave her the half of the linen i had kept in order to reclaim him if we
became rich.”

“what letters were marked on the linen?” said monte cristo.

“an h and an n, surmounted by a baron’s coronet.”

“by heaven, m. bertuccio, you make use of heraldic terms; where did you
study heraldry?”

“in your service, excellency, where everything is learned.”

e itself more prematurely, and yet it was not owing to any fault
in his bringing up. he was a most lovely child, with large blue eyes, of
that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion; only
his hair, which was too light, gave his face a most singular expression,
and added to the vivacity of his look, and the malice of his smile.
unfortunately, there is a proverb which says that ‘red is either
altogether good or altogether bad.’ the proverb was but too correct as
regarded benedetto, and even in his infancy he manifested the worst
disposition. it is true that the indulgence of his foster-mother
encouraged him. this child, for whom my poor sister would go to the
town, five or six leagues off, to purchase the earliest fruits and the
most tempting sweetmeats, preferred to palma grapes or genoese
preserves, the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor’s orchard, or the dried
apples in his loft, when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples
that grew in my garden. one day, when be

nedetto was about five or six,
our neighbor wasilio, who, according to the custom of the country, never
locked up his purse or his valuables--for, as your excellency knows,
there are no thieves in corsica--complained that he had lost a louis out
of his purse; we thought he must have made a mistake in counting his
money, but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement. one day,
benedetto, who had been gone from the house since morning, to our great
anxiety, did not return until late in the evening, dragging a monkey
after him, which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree. for
more than a month past, the mischievous child, who knew not what to wish
for, had taken it into his head to have a monkey. a boatman, who had
passed by rogliano, and who had several of these animals, whose tricks
had greatly diverted him, had, doubtless, suggested this idea to him.

how you obtained this animal.’ benedetto maintained the truth of what he
had said, and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his
imagination than to his veracity. i became angry; he began to laugh, i
threatened to strike him, and he made two steps backwards. ‘you cannot
beat me,’ said he; ‘you have no right, for you are not my father.’


“we never knew who had revealed this fatal secret, which we had so
carefully concealed from him; however, it was this answer, in which the

my arm fell without touching him. the boy triumphed, and this victory
rendered him so audacious, that all the money of assunta, whose
affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it,
was spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against, and follies
she had not the courage to prevent. when i was at rogliano everything
went on properly, but no sooner was my back turned than benedetto became
master, and everything went ill. when he was only eleven, he chose his
companions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty, the worst
characters in bastia, or, indeed, in corsica, and they had already, for
some mischievous pranks, been several times threatened with a
prosecution. i became alarmed, as any prosecution might be attended with
serious consequences. i was compelled, at this period, to leave corsica
on an important expedition; i reflected for a long time, and with the

should accompany me. i hoped that the active and laborious life of a
smuggler, with the severe discipline on board, would have a salutary
effect on his character, which was now well-nigh, if not quite, corrupt.
i spoke to benedetto alone, and proposed to him to accompany me,
endeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the
imagination of a child of twelve. he heard me patiently, and when i had
finished, burst out laughing.

“‘are you mad, uncle?’ (he called me by this name when he was in good
humor); ‘do you think i am going to change the life i lead for your mode
of existence--my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil
you impose on yourself, exposed to the bitter frost at night

perceived, receive a volley of bullets, all to earn a paltry sum? why, i
have as much money as i want; mother assunta always furnishes me when i
ask for it! you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer.’ the
arguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me. benedetto rejoined
his associates, and i saw him from a distance point me out to them as a
fool.”

“sweet child,” murmured monte cristo.

“oh, had he been my own son,” replied bertuccio, “or even my nephew, i
would have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that
you are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that i was
striking a child whose father i had killed, made it impossible for me to
punish him. i gave my sister, who constantly defended the unfortunate

benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for when the fit
seized him, he learned more in a day than others in a week. my intention
was to enter him as a clerk in some ship, and without letting him know
anything of my plan, to convey him some morning on board; by this means
his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct. i set off for
france, after having fixed upon the plan. our cargo was to be landed in
the gulf of lyons, and this was a difficult thing to do because it was

“alas, i have still to recount the most distressing period of my life.
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister, i
lost no time in hastening to corsica, but when i arrived at rogliano i
found a house of mourning, the consequences of a scene so horrible that
the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day. acting by my advice,
my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of
benedetto, who was continually tormenting her for money, as long as he
believed there was a sou left in her possession. one morning he
threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him
with what he desired, and disappeared and remained away all day, leaving
the kind-hearted assunta, who loved him as if he were her own child, to
weep over his conduct and bewail his absence. evening came, and still,
with all the patient solicitude of a mother, she watched for his return.

by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions. she
stretched out her arms to him, but they seized hold of her, and one of
the three--none other than the accursed benedetto exclaimed,--‘put her
to torture and she’ll soon tell us where her money is.’

“it unfortunately happened that our neighbor, wasilio, was at bastia,
leaving no person in his house but his wife; no human creature beside
could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling. two held

smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners.

or, but it was fastened; she flew to the windows,
but they were also secured; then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks;
it was assunta calling for help. the cries died away in groans, and next
morning, as soon as wasilio’s wife could muster up courage to venture
abroad, she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public
authorities, when assunta, although dreadfully burnt, was found still
breathing; every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open,
and the money stolen. benedetto never again appeared at rogliano,
neither have i since that day either seen or heard anything concerning
him.

“it was subsequently to these dreadful events that i waited on your
excellency, to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned
benedetto, since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my sister,
since she was dead.”

“and in what light did you view the occurrence?” inquired monte cristo.

“as a punishment for the crime i had committed,” answered bertuccio.
“oh, t

 whose hand the ground
was dug to receive the corpse of his child.”

“everything is possible,” said monte cristo, rising from the bench on
which he had been sitting; “even,” he added in an inaudible voice, “even
that the procureur be not dead. the abbé busoni did right to send you to
me,” he went on in his ordinary tone, “and you have done well in
relating to me the whole of your history, as it will prevent my forming
any erroneous opinions concerning you in future. as for that benedetto,
who so grossly belied his name, have you never made any effort to trace
out whither he has gone, or what has become of him?”

“no; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, i should
shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast. thank god,
i have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and i hope and
believe he is dead.”

“do not think so, bertuccio,” replied the count; “for the wicked are not
so easily disposed of, for god seems to have them und

care to make of them instruments of his vengeance.”

“so be it,” responded bertuccio, “all i ask of heaven is that i may
never see him again. and now, your excellency,” he added, bowing his
head, “you know everything--you are my judge on earth, as the almighty
is in heaven; have you for me no words of consolation?”

“my good friend, i can only repeat the words addressed to you by the
abbé busoni. villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you,
and, perhaps, to others. benedetto, if still living, will become the
instrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly
punished in his turn. as far as you yourself are concerned, i see but
one point in which you are really guilty. ask yourself, wherefore, after
rescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it to its
mother? there was the crime, bertuccio--that was where you became really
culpable.”

“true, excellency, that was the crime, the real crime, for in that i

“eight!” repeated bertuccio.

“stop! you are in a shocking hurry to be off--you forget one of my
guests. lean a little to the left. stay! look at m. andrea cavalcanti,
the young man in a black coat, looking at murillo’s ‘madonna’; now he is
turning.” this time bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation, had not
a look from monte cristo silenced him. “benedetto?” he muttered;
“fatality!”

“half-past six o’clock has just struck, m. bertuccio,” said the count
severely; “i ordered dinner at that hour, and i do not like to wait;”
 and he returned to his guests, while bertuccio, leaning against the
wall, succeeded in reaching the dining-room. five minutes afterwards the
doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and bertuccio appearing
said, with a violent effort, “the dinner waits.”

familiarity. “tell me,” he said--“tell me what you want?”

“well, then, i want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and carry
me back.” andrea turned pale, but said nothing.

“yes,” said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking
impudently at the youth; “i have taken the whim into my head; do you
understand, master benedetto?”

at this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went
towards his groom, saying, “this man is right; i did indeed charge him
with a commission, the result of which he must tell me; walk to the
barrier, there take a cab, that you may not be too late.” the surprised
groom retired. “let me at least reach a shady spot,” said andrea.

“oh, as for that, i’ll take you to a splendid place,” said the man with
the handkerchief; and taking the horse’s bit he led the ti

“you are lucky; i wish i could say as much, for i do conceal myself; and
then i was afraid you would not recognize me, but you did,” added
caderousse with his unpleasant smile. “it was very polite of you.”

“come,” said andrea, “what do you want?”

“you do not speak affectionately to me, benedetto, my old friend, that
is not right--take care, or i may become troublesome.” this menace
smothered the young man’s passion. he urged the horse again into a trot.
“you should not speak so to an old friend like me, caderousse, as you
said just now; you are a native of marseilles, i am----”

“do you know then now what you are?”

“no, but i was brought up in corsica; you are old and obstinate, i am

“what are you waiting for?” said caderousse. “i hope i am not the
cause.”

“hush,” said andrea. they passed the barrier without accident. at the
first cross street andrea stopped his horse, and caderousse leaped out.

“well!” said andrea,--“my servant’s coat and my hat?”

“ah,” said caderousse, “you would not like me to risk taking cold?”

“but what am i to do?”

“you? oh, you are young while i am beginning to get old. _au revoir_,
benedetto;” and running into a court, he disappeared.

“alas,” said andrea, sighing, “one cannot be completely happy in this
world!”

then led the young man into the study, and either by chance or manœuvre
the door was partially closed after andrea, so that from the place where
they sat neither the count nor the baroness could see anything; but as
the banker had accompanied andrea, madame danglars appeared to take no
notice of it.

the count soon heard andrea’s voice, singing a corsican song,
accompanied by the piano. while the count smiled at hearing this song,
which made him lose sight of andrea in the recollection of benedetto,
madame danglars was boasting to monte cristo of her husband’s strength
of mind, who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand
francs by a failure at milan. the praise was well deserved, for had not
the count heard it from the baroness, or by one of those means by which
he knew everything, the baron’s countenance would not have led him to
suspect it. “hem,” thought monte cristo, “he begins to conceal his
losses; a month since he boasted of them.” then aloud,--“oh,

not like you, do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead
me? think for a moment. you have your servant’s clothes on--you
therefore keep a servant; i have none, and am obliged to prepare my own
meals. you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d’hôte of the
hôtel des princes, or the café de paris. well, i too could keep a
servant; i too could have a tilbury; i too could dine where i like; but
why do i not? because i would not annoy my little benedetto. come, just
acknowledge that i could, eh?” this address was accompanied by a look
which was by no means difficult to understand. “well,” said andrea,
“admitting your love, why do you want me to breakfast with you?”

“that i may have the pleasure of seeing you, my little fellow.”

“what is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements?”

“eh, dear friend,” said caderousse, “are wills ever made without
codicils? but you first came to breakfast, did you not?

have put on some vine-leaves to please you, wicked one. ah, yes; you
look at my room, my four straw chairs, my images, three francs each. but
what do you expect? this is not the hôtel des princes.”

“come, you are growing discontented, you are no longer happy; you, who
only wish to live like a retired baker.” caderousse sighed. “well, what
have you to say? you have seen your dream realized.”

“i can still say it is a dream; a retired baker, my poor benedetto, is
rich--he has an annuity.”

“well, you have an annuity.”

“i have?”


“yes, since i bring you your two hundred francs.” caderousse shrugged
his shoulders. “it is humiliating,” said he, “thus to receive money
given grudgingly,--an uncertain supply which may soon fail. you see i am
obliged to economize, in case your prosperity should cease. well, my
friend, fortune is inconstant, as the chaplain of the regiment said. i
know your prosperity is great, you rascal; you are to m

“what? of danglars?”

“yes, to be sure; must i say baron danglars? i might as well say count
benedetto. he was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a
memory he ought to invite me to your wedding, seeing he came to mine.
yes, yes, to mine; gad, he was not so proud then,--he was an under-clerk
to the good m. morrel. i have dined many times with him and the count of
morcerf, so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate
them a little, we might meet in the same drawing-rooms.”

“come, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light.”

“that is all ve

perhaps i may one day put on my best coat, and presenting myself at the
great gate, introduce myself. meanwhile let us sit down and eat.”
 caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good
appetite, praising each dish he set before his visitor. the latter
seemed to have resigned himself; he drew the corks, and partook largely
of the fish with the garlic and fat. “ah, mate,” said caderousse, “you
are getting on better terms with your old la

 a robbery, to spoil all my good fortune--and
yours with mine--and both of us to be dragged down there again?”

“it would make very little difference to me,” said caderousse, “if i
were retaken, i am a poor creature to live alone, and sometimes pine for
my old comrades; not like you, heartless creature, who would be glad
never to see them again.” andrea did more than tremble this time, he
turned pale.

“come, caderousse, no nonsense!” said he.

“don’t alarm yourself, my little benedetto, but just point out to me
some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your
assistance, and i will contrive it.”

“well, i’ll see--i’ll try to contrive some way,” said andrea.

“meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs,
my little fellow? i have a fancy, and mean to get a housekeeper.”

“well, you shall have your five hundred francs,” said andrea; “but it is
very hard for me, my poor caderousse--you take advantage----”

“thank you,” said andrea; “i will let you know a week beforehand.” they
parted. caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen
andrea go down the three stories, but also cross the court. then he
returned hastily, shut his door carefully, and began to study, like a
clever architect, the plan andrea had left him.

“dear benedetto,” said he, “i think he will not be sorry to inherit his
fortune, and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred
thousand will not be his worst friend.”



chapter 82. the burglary

the day following that on which the conversation we have related took
place, the count of monte cristo set out for auteuil, accompanied by ali
and several attendants, and also taking with him some horses whose
qualities he was desirous of ascertaining. he was induced to undertake
this journey, of

cristo, “i may indeed say you are my deliverer!”

“you mean to say you have been freed from confinement?”

“yes, that is true, reverend sir.”

“who was your liberator?”

“an englishman.”

“what was his name?”

“lord wilmore.”

“i know him; i shall know if you lie.”

“ah, reverend sir, i tell you the simple truth.”

“was this englishman protecting you?”

“no, not me, but a young corsican, my companion.”

“what was this young corsican’s name?”

“benedetto.”

“is that his christian name?”

“he had no other; he was a foundling.”

“then this young man escaped with you?”

“he did.”

“in what way?”

“we were working at saint-mandrier, near toulon. do you know saint-
mandrier?”

“i do.”

“in the hour of rest, between noon and one o’clock----”

“galley-slaves having a nap after dinner! we may well pity the poor
fellows!” said the abbé.

“nay,” said caderousse, “one can’t always work--one is not a dog.”
 
 ___________________________
 


“so much the better for the dogs,” said monte cristo.

“while the rest slept, then, we went away a short distance; we severed
our fetters with a file the englishman had given us, and swam away.”

“and what is become of this benedetto?”

“i don’t know.”

“you ought to know.”

“no, in truth; we parted at hyères.” and, to give more weight to his
protestation, caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé, who
remained motionless in his place, as calm as ever, and pursuing his
interrogation. “you lie,” said the abbé busoni, with a tone of
irresistible authority.

“reverend sir!”

“you lie! this man is still your friend, and you, perhaps, make use of
him as your accomplice.”


“oh, reverend s

ir!”

“since you left toulon what have you lived on? answer me!”

“on what i could get.”

“you lie,” repeated the abbé a third time, with a still more imperative
tone. caderousse, terrified, looked at the count. “you have lived on the
money he has given you.”

“true,” said caderousse; “benedetto has become the son of a great lord.”

“how can he be the son of a great lord?”

“a natural son.”

“and what is that great lord’s name?”

“the count of monte cristo, the very same in whose house we are.”

“benedetto the count’s son?” replied monte cristo, astonished in his
turn.

“well, i should think so, since the count has found him a false father--
since the count gives him four thousand francs a month, and leaves him
500,000 francs in his will.”

“ah, yes,”

is still serving him.”

“oh!” said caderousse, groaning with pain.

“take this pen and paper, and write what i dictate.”

“i don’t know how to write, reverend sir.”

“you lie! take this pen, and write!” caderousse, awed by the superior
power of the abbé, sat down and wrote:--

sir,--the man whom you are receiving at your house, and to whom you
intend to marry your daughter, is a felon who escaped with me from
confinement at toulon. he was no. 59, and i no. 58. he was called
benedetto, but he is ignorant of his real name, having never known his
parents.

“sign it!” continued the count.

“but would you ruin me?”

“if i sought your ruin, fool, i should drag you to the first guard-
house; besides, when that note is delivered, in all probability you will
have no more to fear. sign it, then!”

caderousse signed it. “the address, ‘to monsieur the baron danglars,
banker, rue de la chaussée d’antin.’” caderousse wrote the address. the
abbé took the note. “n

beyed, leaving the abbé alone with caderousse,
who had not yet revived.

when the wretched man again opened his eyes, the count looked at him
with a mournful expression of pity, and his lips moved as if in prayer.
“a surgeon, reverend sir--a surgeon!” said caderousse.

“i have sent for one,” replied the abbé.

“i know he cannot save my life, but he may strengthen me to give my
evidence.”

“against whom?”

“against my murderer.”

“did you recognize him?”

“yes; it was benedetto.”

“the young corsican?”

“himself.”

“your comrade?”

“yes. after giving me the plan of this house, doubtless hoping i should
kill the count and he thus become his heir, or that the count would kill
me and i should be out of his way, he waylaid me, and has murdered me.”

“i have also sent for the procureur.”

“he will not come in time; i feel my life fast ebbing.”

“wait a moment,” said monte cristo. he left the room, and returned in
five minutes with a phial. the

d dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the
contents of the phial. caderousse drew a deep breath. “oh,” said he,
“that is life to me; more, more!”

“two drops more would kill you,” replied the abbé.

“oh, send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch!”

“shall i write your deposition? you can sign it.”

“yes, yes,” said caderousse; and his eyes glistened at the thought of
this posthumous revenge. monte cristo wrote:--

“i die, murdered by the corsican benedetto, my comrade in the galleys at
toulouse, no. 59.”

“quick, quick!” said caderousse, “or i shall be unable to sign it.”

monte cristo gave the pen to caderousse, who collected all his strength,
signed it, and fell back on his bed, saying: “you will relate all the
rest, reverend sir; you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti. he
lodges at the hôtel des princes. oh, i am dying!” he again fainted. the
abbé made him smell the contents of the phial, and he again opened his
eyes.

whole time, and when he saw you leave the house, ran to the angle of the
wall to conceal himself.”

“did you see all that?”

“remember my words: ‘if you return home safely, i shall believe god has
forgiven you, and i will forgive you also.’”

“and you did not warn me!” cried caderousse, raising himself on his
elbows. “you knew i should be killed on leaving this house, and did not
warn me!”


“no; for i saw god’s justice placed in the hands of benedetto, and
should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence.”

“god’s justice! speak not of it, reverend sir. if god were just, you
know how many would be punished who now escape.”

“patience,” said the abbé, in a tone which made the dying man shudder;
“have patience!” caderousse looked at him with amazement. “besides,”
 said the abbé, “god is merciful to all, as he has been to you; he is
first a father, then a judge.”

“do you then believe in god?” s

reason, without excuse. god is wearied; he has punished you.”

caderousse was fast sinking. “give me drink,” said he: “i thirst--i
burn!” monte cristo gave him a glass of water. “and yet that villain,
benedetto, will escape!”

“no one, i tell you, will escape; benedetto will be punished.”

“then, you, too, will be punished, for you did not do your duty as a
priest--you should have prevented benedetto from killing me.”

“i?” said the count, with a smile which petrified the dying man, “when
you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected
my breast! yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent, i might
have prevented benedetto from killing you; but i found yo

“_one!_” said the count mysteriously, his eyes fixed on the corpse,
disfigured by so awful a death. ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and
the procureur arrived, the one accompanied by the porter, the other by
ali, and were received by the abbé busoni, who was praying by the side
of the corpse.



chapter 84. beauchamp

the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation
throughout paris for the next fortnight. the dying man had signed a
deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin. the police had orders
to make the strictest search for the murderer. caderousse’s knife, dark
lantern, bunch of keys, and clothing, excepting the waistcoat, which
could not be found, were deposited at the registry; the corpse was
conveyed to the morgue. the count told everyone that this adventure had
happened during his absence at auteuil, and that he only knew what was
related by the abbé busoni, who that evening, by mere chance, had
requested to pass the night in his ho

was mentioned in his presence, but there was no reason why anyone should

preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to
exercise when required to speak in criminal cases.

 he was quite alone; on one
side was the vast wilderness of the saint-lazare, on the other, paris
enshrouded in darkness. “am i to be captured?” he cried; “no, not if i
can use more activity than my enemies. my safety is now a mere question
of speed.” at this moment he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg
poissonnière. the dull driver, smoking his pipe, was plodding along
toward the limits of the faubourg saint-denis, where no doubt he
ordinarily had his station. “ho, friend!” said benedetto.

“what do you want, sir?” asked the driver.

“is your horse tired?”

“tired? oh, yes, tired enough--he has done nothing the whole of this
blessed day! four wretched fares, and twenty sous over, making in all
seven francs, are all that i have earned, and i ought to take ten to the
owner.”

“will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?”

“with pleasure, sir; twenty francs are not to be despised. tell me what
i am to do for this.”

“i came to ask you, my friend,” said the baroness, “what will be done
with this impostor?”

“impostor,” repeated villefort; “certainly, madame, you appear to
extenuate some cases, and exaggerate others. impostor, indeed!--m.
andrea cavalcanti, or rather m. benedetto, is nothing more nor less than
an assassin!”

“sir, i do not deny the justice of your correction, but the more
severely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man, the more deeply
will you strike our family. come, forget him for a moment, and instead
of pursuing him, let him go.”

“you are too late, madame; the orders are issued.”

“well, should he be arrested--do they think they will arrest him?”

“i hope so.”

“if they should arrest him (i know that sometimes prisons af

madame, dare you ask for mercy for that wretch!”

“but, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?”

“listen; this is his description: ‘benedetto, condemned, at the age of
sixteen, for five years to the galleys for forgery.’ he promised well,
as you see--first a runaway, then an assassin.”

“and who is this wretch?”

“who can tell?--a vagabond, a corsican.”

“has no one owned him?”

“no one; his parents are unknown.”

“but who was the man who brought him from lucca?”

chapter 100. the apparition

as the procureur had told madame danglars, valentine was not yet
recovered. bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed;
and it was in her own room, and from the lips of madame de villefort,
that she heard all the strange events we have related,--we mean the
flight of eugénie and the arrest of andrea cavalcanti, or rather
benedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against
him. but valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the
same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of
health. indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and confused
forms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented themselves before
her eyes.

during the daytime valentine’s perceptions remained tolerably clear,
owing to the constant presence of m. noirtier, who caused himself to be

ancied she saw her stepmother
threatening her, then morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes
mere strangers, like the count of monte cristo came to visit her; even
the very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and
this state lasted till about three o’clock in the morning, when a deep,
heavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake till
daylight. on the evening of the day on which valentine had learned of
the flight of eugénie and the arrest of benedetto,--villefort having
retired as well as noirtier and d’avrigny,--her thoughts wandered in a
confused maze, alternately reviewing her own situation and the events
she had just heard.

eleven o’clock had struck. the nurse, having placed the beverage

“grief has stunned him,” replied d’avrigny; and they both returned
thoughtfully to the procureur’s study.

“see, i have not slept,” said villefort, showing his undisturbed bed;
“grief does not stun me. i have not been in bed for two nights; but then
look at my desk; see what i have written during these two days and
nights. i have filled those papers, and have made out the accusation
against the assassin benedetto. oh, work, work,--my passion, my joy, my
delight,--it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows!” and he convulsively
grasped the hand of d’avrigny.

“do you require my services now?” asked d’avrigny.

“no,” said villefort; “only return again at eleven o’clock; at twelve

becoming a man, lifted up his eyes and groaned.

“shall you be present in the reception room?”

“no; i have a cousin who has undertaken th

the puritanical procureur, who has just lost his daughter, and in fact
nearly all his family, in so singular a manner; morcerf dishonored and
dead; and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of
benedetto; besides----”

“besides what?” asked the count.

“alas, do you not know?”

“what new calamity?”

“my daughter----”

“mademoiselle danglars?”

“eugénie has left us!”

“good heavens, what are you telling me?”

“the truth, my dear count. oh, how happy you must be in not having
either wife or children!”

“do you think so?”

“indeed i do.”

“and so mademoiselle danglars----”

“she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch, so she

“yes; but without fail.”

“ah, you are laughing at me; send tomorrow at twelve, and the bank shall

“i will come myself.”

“better still, since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you.” they
shook hands. “by the way,” said m. de boville, “are you not going to the
funeral of poor mademoiselle de villefort, which i met on my road here?”

“no,” said the banker; “i have appeared rather ridiculous since that
affair of benedetto, so i remain in the background.”

“bah, you are wrong. how were you to blame in that affair?”

“listen--when one bears an irreproachable name, as i do, one is rather
sensitive.”

“everybody pities you, sir; and, above all, mademoiselle danglars!”

“poor eugénie!” said danglars; “do you know she is going to embrace a
religious life?”

“no.”

“alas, it is unhappily but too true. the day after the event, she
decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance; they

d to say that the gentleman was right; that he intended to be civil,
in his way, and that they would set the example of liberty of
conscience,--and the mob retired. the keeper was so stupefied at this
scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person,
attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions’ den to
something more substantial than mere fascination. andrea made no
resistance, although he protested against it. suddenly a voice was heard
at the wicket. “benedetto!” exclaimed an inspector. the keeper relaxed
his hold. “i am called,” said andrea. “to the visitors’ room!” said the
same voice.

“you see someone pays me a visit. ah, my dear sir, you will see whether
a cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person!” and andrea, gliding
through the court like a black shadow, rushed out through the wicket,
leaving his comrades, and even the keeper, lost in wonder. certainly a
call to the visitors’ room had scarcely astonished andrea less th

magistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or the
doctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for. behind the grating
of the room into which andrea had been led, he saw, while his eyes
dilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of m. bertuccio,
who was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars, the bolted
doors, and the shadow which moved behind the other grating.

“ah,” said andrea, deeply affected.

“good morning, benedetto,” said bertuccio, with his deep, hollow voice.

“you--you?” said the young man, looking fearfully around him.

“do you not recognize me, unhappy child?”

“silence,--be silent!” said andrea, who knew the delicate sense of
hearing possessed by the walls; “for heaven’s sake, do not speak so
loud!”

“you wish to speak with me alone, do you not?” said bertuccio.

“oh, yes.”

“that is well.” and bertuccio, feeling in his pocket, signed to a keeper

“well, be it so. you have continued your course of villany; you have

me this, you might have saved yourself the trouble. i know all these
things. but there are some with which, on the contrary, i am not
acquainted. let us talk of those, if you please. who sent you?”

“come, come, you are going on quickly, m. benedetto!”

“yes, and to the point. let us dispense with useless words. who sends
you?”

“no one.”

“how did you know i was in prison?”

“i recognized you, some time since, as the insolent dandy who so
gracefully mounted his horse in the champs-élysées.”

“oh, the champs-élysées? ah, yes; we burn, as they say at the game of
pincette. the champs-élysées? come, let us talk a little about my
father.”

“who, then, am i?”

“you, sir?--you are my adopted father. but it was no

“oh, these are fine words.”

“and there will be fine doings, if you do not take care.”

“menaces--i do not fear them. i will say----”

“do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?” said
bertuccio, in so calm a tone, and with so steadfast a look, that andrea
was moved to the very soul. “do you think you have to do with galley-
slaves, or novices in the world? benedetto, you are fallen into terrible
hands; they are ready to open for you--make use of them. do not play
with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment, but which they
can take up again instantly, if you attempt to intercept their
movements.”


“my father--i will know who my father is,” said the obstinate youth; “i
will perish if i must, but i _will_ know it. what does scandal signify
to me? what possessions, what reputation, what ‘pull,’ as beauchamp
says,--have i? you great peop

“i came to tell you.”

“ah,” cried benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy. just then the door
opened, and the jailer, addressing himself to bertuccio, said,--“excuse
me, sir, but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner.”

“and so closes our interview,” said andrea to the worthy steward; “i
wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil!”

“i will return tomorrow,” said bertuccio.

 in his
room, exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case
against the murderer of caderousse. this affair, like all those in which
the count of monte cristo had interfered, caused a great sensation in
paris. the proofs were certainly not convincing, since they rested upon
a few words written by an escaped galley-slave on his death-bed, and who
might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion.
but the mind of the procureur was made up; he felt assured that
benedetto was guilty, and he hoped by his skill in conducting this
aggravated case to flatter his self-love, which was about the only
vulnerable point left in his frozen heart.

the case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of
villefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming
assizes. he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever, to evade
the enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose of
obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day

of trial. and
then so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor valentine, and
the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent, that no one
wondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties, which
were the only means he had of dissipating his grief.

once only had villefort seen his father; it was the day after that upon
which bertuccio had paid his second visit to benedetto, when the latter
was to learn his father’s name. the magistrate, harassed and fatigued,
had descended to the garden of his house, and in a gloomy mood, similar
to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies, he began
knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose-
trees, which, placed along the avenue, seemed like the spectres of the
brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season. more than once
he had reached that part of the garden where the famous board

the king’s attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity; he looked
upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly, “farewell,
madame, farewell!” that farewell struck madame de villefort like the
executioner’s knife. she fainted. the procureur went out, after having
double-locked the door.



chapter 109. the assizes

the benedetto affair, as it was called at the palais, and by people in
general, had produced a tremendous sensation. frequenting the café de
paris, the boulevard de gand, and the bois de boulogne, during his brief
career of splendor, the false cavalcanti had formed a host of
acquaintances. the papers had related his various adventures, both as
the man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as everyone who had been
personally acquainted with prince andrea cavalcanti experienced a lively
curiosity in his fate,

they all determined to spare no trouble in
endeavoring to witness the trial of m. benedetto for the murder of his
comrade in chains.

in the eyes of many, benedetto appeared, if not a victim to, at least an
instance of, the fallibility of the law. m. cavalcanti, his father, had
been seen in paris, and it was expected that he would re-appear to claim
the illustrious outcast. many, also, who were not aware of the
circumstances attending his withdrawal from paris, were struck with the
worthy appearance, the gentlemanly bearing, and the knowledge of the
world displayed by the old patrician, who certainly played the nobleman

“a nobility of the rope!” said château-renaud phlegmatically.

“he will be condemned, will he not?” asked debray of beauchamp.

“my dear fellow, i think we should ask you that question; you know such
news much better than we do. did you see the president at the minister’s
last night?”

“yes.”

“what did he say?”

“something which will surprise you.”

“oh, make haste and tell me, then; it is a long time since that has
happened.”

“well, he told me that benedetto, who is considered a serpent of
subtlety and a giant of cunning, is really but a very commonplace, silly
rascal, and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on
his phrenological organs after his death.”

“bah,” said beauchamp, “he played the prince very well.”

“yes, for you who detest those unhappy princes, beauchamp, and are
always delighted to find fault with them; but not for me, who discover a
gentleman by instinct, and who scent out an aristocratic family like

sister did not seem uneasy, and told me that though she had not seen him
for two or three days, she was sure he was well.”

“ah, now i think of it, the count of monte cristo cannot appear in the
hall,” said beauchamp.

“why not?”

“because he is an actor in the drama.”

“has he assassinated anyone, then?”

“no, on the contrary, they wished to assassinate him. you know that it
was in leaving his house that m. de caderousse was murdered by his
friend benedetto. you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his
house, containing the letter which stopped the signature of the
marriage-contract. do you see the waistcoat? there it is, all blood-
stained, on the desk, as a testimony of the crime.”

“ah, very good.”

“hush, gentlemen, here is the court; let us go back to our places.” a
noise was heard in the hall; the sergeant called his two patrons with an
energetic “hem!” and the door-keeper appearing, called out with that
shrill voice pec

t said of general admiration, sat in the
armchair and cast a tranquil glance around him. everyone looked with
astonishment on that grave and severe face, whose calm expression
personal griefs had been unable to disturb, and the aspect of a man who
was a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror.

“gendarmes,” said the president, “lead in the accused.”

at these words the public attention became more intense, and all eyes
were turned towards the door through which benedetto was to enter. the
door soon opened and the accused appeared. the same impression was
experienced by all present, and no one was deceived by the expression of
his countenance. his features bore no sign of that deep emotion which
stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek. his hands,
gracefully placed, one upon his hat, the other in the opening of his
white waistcoat, were not at all tremulous; his eye was calm and even
brilliant. scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the

nd implacable pen of villefort. during the reading of this,
which was long, the public attention was continually drawn towards
andrea, who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern. villefort had
never been so concise and eloquent. the crime was depicted in the most
vivid colors; the former life of the prisoner, his transformation, a
review of his life from the earliest period, were set forth with all the
talent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that
of the procureur. benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion
before the sentence of the law could be pronounced.

andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought
against him. m. de villefort, who examined him attentively, and who no
doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed
to use, in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes, notwithstanding
the depth and profundity of his gaze. at length the reading of the
indictment was ended.

“i will answer that question, as well as the rest, mr. president, but in
its turn.”

“your age?” repeated the president.

“i am twenty-one years old, or rather i shall be in a few days, as i was
born the night of the 27th of september, 1817.” m. de villefort, who was
busy taking down some notes, raised his head at the mention of this
date. “where were you born?” continued the president.

“at auteuil, near paris.” m. de villefort a second time raised his head,
looked at benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of medusa, and
became livid. as for benedetto, he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine
cambric pocket-handkerchief.

“your profession?”

“first i was a forger,” answered andrea, as calmly as possible; “then i
became a thief, and lately have become an assassin.” a murmur, or rather
storm, of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly. the judges
themselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury manifested tokens of
disgust for a cynicism so

 unexpected in a man of fashion. m. de
villefort pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at first pale, had
become red and burning; then he suddenly arose and looked around as
though he had lost his senses--he wanted air.


“are you looking for anything, mr. procureur?” asked benedetto, with his
most ingratiating smile. m. de villefort answered nothing, but sat, or
rather threw himself down again upon his chair.

“and now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?” said the
president. “the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and
classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the part of the
court, both in the name of morality, and for the respect due to
humanity. you appear to consider this a point of honor, and it may be
for this reason, that

you have delayed acknowledging your name. you
wished it to be preceded by all these titles.”

“it is quite wonderful, mr. president, how entirely you have read my
thoughts,” said benedetto, in his softest voice and most polite manner.
“this is, indeed, the reason why i begged you to alter the order of the
questions.” the public astonishment had reached its height. there was no
longer any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused. the audience
felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude.

“well,” said the president; “your name?”

“i cannot tell you my name, since i do not know it; but i know my
father’s, and can tell it to you.”

aid the president, stupefied, and without noticing
the agitation which spread over the face of m. de villefort; “king’s
attorney?”

“yes; and if you wish to know his name, i will tell it,--he is named
villefort.” the explosion, which had been so long restrained from a
feeling of respect to the court of justice, now burst forth like thunder
from the breasts of all present; the court itself did not seek to
restrain the feelings of the audience. the exclamations, the insults
addressed to benedetto, who remained perfectly unconcerned, the
energetic gestures, the movement of the gendarmes, the sneers of the
scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any
disturbance--all this lasted five minutes, before the door-keepers and
magistrates were able to restore silence. in the midst of this tumult
the voice of the president was heard to exclaim,--“are you playing with
justice, accused, and do you dare set your fellow-citizens an example of
disorder which even in these time

there was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the
young man, which silenced the tumult. all eyes were turned for a moment
towards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had
changed him into a corpse. “gentlemen,” said andrea, commanding silence
by his voice and manner; “i owe you the proofs and explanations of what
i have said.”

“but,” said the irritated president, “you called yourself benedetto,
declared yourself an orphan, and claimed corsica as your country.”

“i said anything i pleased, in order that the solemn declaration i have
just made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly have
been the case. i now repeat that i was born at auteuil on the night of
the 27th of september, 1817, and that i am the son of the procureur, m.

before fainted, and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics. she
was carried out of the hall, the thick veil which concealed her face
dropped off, and madame danglars was recognized. notwithstanding his
shattered nerves, the ringing sensation in his ears, and the madness
which turned his brain, villefort rose as he perceived her.

“the proofs, the proofs!” said the president; “remember this tissue of
horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs.”

“the proofs?” said benedetto, laughing; “do you want proofs?”

“yes.”

“well, then, look at m. de villefort, and then ask me for proofs.”

everyone turned towards the procureur, who, unable to bear the universal
gaze now riveted on him alone, advanced staggering into the midst of the
tribunal, with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark
of his nails. the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment.

“father,” said benedetto, “i am asked for proofs, do you wish me to give
them?
