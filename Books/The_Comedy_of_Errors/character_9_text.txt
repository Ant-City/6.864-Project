orpentine;
for there’s the house: that chain will i bestow--
be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,                       120
i’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.

_ang._ i’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.

_ant. e._ do so. this jest shall cost me some expense.
