scene 

the same as in oedipus the king, an open space before the royal palace, once that of oedipus, at thebes. the backscene represents the front of the palace, with three doors, of which the central and largest is the principal entrance into the house. the time is at daybreak on the morning after the fall of the two brothers, eteocles and polyneices, and the flight of the defeated argives. antigone calls ismene forth from the palace, in order to spea

dest first in honour, thou and thy mother whom the lightning smote; and now, when all our people is captive to a violent plague, come thou with healing feet over the parnassian height, or over the moaning strait! 

antistrophe 2

o thou with whom the stars rejoice as they move, the stars whose breath is fire; o master of the voices of the night; son begotten of zeus; appear, o king, with thine attendant thyiads, who in night-long frenzy dance before thee, the giver of good gifts, iacchus!

messenger
dwellers by the house of cadmus and of amphion, there is no estate of mortal life that i would ever praise or blame as settled. fortune raises and fortune humbles the lucky or unlucky from day to day, and no one can prophesy to men concerning those things which are established. for 

creon was blest once, as i count bliss; he had saved this land of cadmus from its foes; he was clothed with sole dominion in the land; he reigned, the glorious sire of princely

children. and now all hath been lost. for when a man hath forfeited his pleasures, i count him not as living,-i hold him but a breathing corpse. heap up riches in thy house, if thou wilt; live in kingly state; yet, if there be no gladness therewith, i would not give the shadow of a vapour for all the rest, compared with joy.

leader of the chorus
and what is this new grief that thou hast to tell for our princes?

messenger
death; and the living are guilty for the dead.

leader
and who is the slayer? who the stricken? speak.

messenger
haemon hath perished; his blood hath been shed by no stranger.

leader
by his father's hand, or by his own?

messenger
by his own, in wrath with his sire for the murder.

leader
o prophet, how true, then, hast thou proved thy word!

messenger
these things stand thus; ye must consider of the rest.

leader
lo, i see the hapless eurydice, creon's wife, approaching; she comes from the h

enter eurydice from the palace.

eurydice
people of thebes, i heard your words as i was going forth, to salute the goddess pallas with my prayers. even as i was loosing the fastenings of the gate, to open it, the message of a household woe smote on mine ear: i sank back, terror-stricken, into the arms of my handmaids, and my senses fled. but say again what the tidings were; i shall hear them as one who is no stranger to sorrow.

messenger
dear lady, i will witness of what i saw, and will leave no word of the truth untold. why, indeed, should i soothe thee with words in which must presently be found false? truth is ever best.-i attended thy lord as his guide to the furthest part of the plain, where the body of polyneices, torn by dogs, still lay unpitied. we prayed the goddess of the roads, and pluto, in mercy to restrain their wrath; we washed the dead with holy washing; and with freshly-plucked boughs we solemnly burned such re

 clasped the maiden to his faint embrace, and, as he gasped, sent forth on her pale cheek the swift stream of the oozing blood. 

corpse enfolding corpse he lies; he hath won his nuptial rites, poor youth, not here, yet in the halls of death; and he hath witnessed to mankind that, of all curses which cleave to man, ill counsel is the sovereign curse.
eurydice retires into the house.

leader
what wouldst thou augur from this? the lady hath turned back, and is gone, without a word, good or evil.

messenger
i, too, am startled; yet i nourish the hope that, at these sore tidings of her son, she cannot deign to give her sorrow public vent, but in the privacy of the house will set her handmaids to mourn the household grief. for she is not untaught of discretion, that she should err.

leader
i know not; but to me, at least, a strained silence seems to portend peril, no less than vain abundance of lament.

messenger
well, i will enter the house, and learn whether indeed she is not hiding some repressed

the messenger goes into the palace. enter creon, on the spectators' left, with attendants, carrying the shrouded body of haemon on bier. the following lines between creon and the chorus are chanted responsively.

chorus
lo, yonder the king himself draws near, bearing that which tells too clear a tale,-the work of no stranger's madness,-if we may say it,-but of his own misdeeds.

creon
strophe 1

woe for the sins of a darkened soul, stubborn sins, fraught with death! ah, ye behold us, the sire who hath slain,

retched blindness of my counsels! alas, my son, thou hast died in thy youth, by a timeless doom, woe is me!-thy spirit hath fled,-not by thy folly, but by mine own!

chorus
strophe 2

ah me, how all too late thou seemest to see the right! 
creon ah me, i have learned the bitter lesson! but then, methinks, oh then, some god smote me from above with crushing weight, and hurled me into ways of cruelty, woe is me,-overthrowing and trampling on my joy! woe, woe, for the troublous toils of men!
enter messenger from the house.

messenger
sire, thou hast come, methinks, as one whose hands are not empty, but who hath store laid up besides; thou bearest yonder burden with thee-and thou art soon to look upon the woes within thy house.

creon
and what worse ill is yet to follow upon ills?

messenger
thy queen hath died, true mother of yon corpse-ah, hapless lady by blows newly dealt.

est thou, my son? what is this new message that thou bringest-woe, woe is me!-of a wife's doom-of slaughter headed on slaughter?

chorus
thou canst behold: 'tis no longer hidden within.
the doors of the palace are opened, and the corpse of eurydice is disclosed.

creon
antistrophe 2

ah me,-yonder i behold a new, a second woe! what destiny, ah what, can yet await me? i have but now raised my son in my arms,-and there, again, i see a corpse before me! alas, alas, unhappy mother! alas, my child!

messenger
there, at the altar, self-stabbed with a keen knife, she suffered her darkening eyes to close, when she had wailed for the noble fate of megareus who died before, and then for his fate who lies there,-and when, with her last breath, she had invoked evil fortunes upon thee, the slayer of thy sons.

creon
strophe 3

woe, woe! i thrill with dread. is there none to strike me to the heart with two-edged sword?-o miserable that i am, and steeped in miserable anguish!

messenger
yea, both this son's d

creon
and what was the manner of the violent deed by which she passed away?

messenger
her own hand struck her to the heart, when she had learned her son's sorely lamented fate.
creon
strophe 4

ah me, this guilt can never be fixed on any other of mortal kind, for my acquittal! i, even i, was thy slayer, wretched that i am-i own the truth. lead me away, o my servants, lead me hence with all speed, whose life is but as death!

chorus
thy counsels are good, if there can be good with ills; briefest is best, when trouble is in our path.
