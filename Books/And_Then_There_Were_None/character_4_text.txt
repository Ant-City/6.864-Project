"ladies and gentlemen! silence, please!" 

every one was startled. they looked round - at each other, at the walls. who was 
speaking? 

the voice went on - a high clear voice.

against us. we will deal with those accusations presently. at the moment i am 
interested in a minor point amongst the names recited was that of william 
henry blore. but as far as we know there is no one named blore amongst us. the 
name of davis was not mentioned. what have you to say about that, mr. davis?" 

blore said sulkily: 



"cat's out of the bag, it seems. i suppose i'd better admit that my name isn't 
davis." 



"you are william henry blore?" 
"that's right." 



"i will add something," said lombard. "not only are you here under a false name, 
mr. blore, but in addition i've noticed this evening that you're a first-class liar. 
you claim to have come from natal, south africa. i know south africa and natal 
and i'm prepared to swear that you've never set foot in south africa in your life." 

all eyes were turned on blore. angry suspicious eyes. anthony marston moved a 
step nearer to him. his fists clenched themselves.

awaiting the summons. 

general macarthur and the judge had been pacing the terrace outside, 
exchanging desultory comments on the political situation. 

vera claythorne and philip lombard had been up to the summit of the island 
behind the house. there they had discovered william henry blore, standing 
staring at the mainland. 

he said: 

"no sign of that motor boat yet. i've been watching for it." 

vera said, smiling: 

"devon's a sleepy county. things are usually late." 

philip lombard was looking the other way, out to sea. 

he said abruptly: 

"what d'you think of the weather?" 

glancing up at the sky, blore remarked: 

"looks all right to me." 

lombard pursed up his mouth into a whistle. 



he said: 

"it will come on to blow before the day's out." 

blore said:

way of the rest. 

blore snorted with a kind of savage satisfaction.

self-righteous smug old hypocrite. sitting up in court feeling like god almighty. 
he'd got his all right... no more being careful for him. 



and now there were four of them. the girl, lombard, armstrong and himself. 

very soon another of them would go... but it wouldn't be william henry blore. 
he'd see to that all right. 

(but the revolver... what about the revolver? that was the disturbing factor - the 
revolver!) 

blore sat on his bed, his brow furrowed, his little eyes creased and puckered 
while he pondered the problem of the revolver... 

in the silence he could hear the clocks strike downstairs.

he relaxed a little now - even went so far as to lie down on his bed. but he did not 
undress. 

he lay there, thinking. going over the whole business from the beginni
