had no trouble believing it. he was up. he was reading. everybody else in his house was
asleep.
 'listen,' i said, 'i'm writing this book about dresden. i'd like some help remembering
stuff. i wonder if i could come down and see you, and we could drink and talk and
remember.'
 he was unenthusiastic. he said he couldn't remember much. he told me, though, to
come ahead.
 'i think the climax of the book will be the execution of poor old edgar derby,' i said.
'the irony is so great. a whole city gets burned down, and thousands and thousands of
people are killed. and then this one american foot soldier is arrested in the ruins for
taking a teapot. and he's given a regular trial, and then he's shot by a firing squad.'
 'um,' said o'hare.
 'don't you think that's really where the climax should come?' 'i don't know anything
about it,' he said. 'that's your trade, not mine.'

 billy did as he was told, took off his clothes. that was the first thing they told him to
do on tralfamadore, too.
 a german measured billy's upper right arm with his thumb and forefinger, asked a
companion what sort of an army would send a weakling like that to the front. they
looked at the other american bodies now, pointed out a lot more that were nearly as bad
as billy's.
 one of the best bodies belonged to the oldest american by far, a high school teacher
from indianapolis. his name was edgar derby. he hadn't been in billy's boxcar. he'd
been in roland weary's car, had cradled weary's head while he died. so it goes. derby
was forty-four years old. he was so old he had a son who was a marine in the pacific
theater of war.
 derby had pulled political wires to get into the army at his age. the subject he had
taught in indianapolis was contemporary problems in western civilization. he also
coached the tennis team, and took very good care of his body.
 derby's son would survive the war. derby

n camp, he was
given a number, too, and an iron dogtag in which that number was stamped. a slave
laborer from poland had done the stamping. he was dead now. so it goes.
 billy was told to hang the tag around his neck along with his american dogtags, which
he did. the tag was like a salt cracker, perforated down its middle so that a strong man
could snap it in two with his bare hands. in case billy died, which he didn't, half the tag
would mark his body and half would mark his grave.
 after poor edgar derby, the high school teacher, was shot in dresden later on, a doctor
pronounced him dead and snapped his dogtag in two. so it goes.
 properly enrolled and tagged, the americans were led through gate after gate again. in
two days' time now their families would learn from the international red cross that they
were alive.
 next to billy was little paul lazzaro, who had promised to avenge roland weary.
lazzaro wasn't thinking about vengeance. he was thinking about his terrible bellyache.

d shrunk to the size of a walnut. that dry, shriveled pouch was as sore as

 next to lazzaro was poor, doomed old edgar derby, with his american and german
dogs displayed like a necklace, on the outside of his clothes. he had expected to become
a captain, a company commander, because of his wisdom and age. now here he was on
the czechoslovakian border at midnight.
 'halt,' said a guard.
 the americans halted. they stood there quietly in the cold. the sheds they were
among were outwardly like thousands of other sheds they had passed. there was this
difference, though: the sheds had tin chimneys, and out of the chimneys

ock had just struck midnight
and cinderella was lamenting
'goodness me, the clock has struckalackaday,

 billy found the couplet so comical that he not only laughed-he shrieked. he went on
shrieking until he was carried out of the shed and into another, where the hospital was. it
was a six-bed hospital. there weren't any other patients in there.
 billy was put to bed and tied down, and given a shot of morphine. another american
volunteered to watch over him. this volunteer was edgar derby, the high school teacher
who would be shot to death in dresden. so it goes.
 derby sat on a three-legged stool. he was given a book to read. the book was the red
badge of courage, by stephen crane. derby had read it before. now he read it again
while billy pilgrim entered a morphine paradise.
 under morphine, billy had a dream of giraffes in a garden. the giraffes were following
gravel paths, were pausing to munch sugar pears from treetops. billy was a giraffe, too.
he ate a pear. it was a hard

 'it isn't much fun if you have to pinch every penny till it screams.
 'it's nice to have a little breathing room.'
 'her father owns the optometry school where billy was going. he also owns six offices
around our part of the state. he flies his own plane and has a summer place up on lake
george.'
 'that's a beautiful lake.'
 billy fell asleep under his blanket. when he woke up again, he was tied to the bed in
the hospital back in prison. he opened one eye, saw poor old edgar derby reading the
red badge of courage by candlelight.
 billy closed that one eye saw in his memory of the future poor old edgar derby in
front of a firing squad in the ruins of dresden. there were only four men in that squad.
billy had heard that one man in each firing squad was customarily given a rifle loaded
with blank cartridge. billy didn't think there would be a blank cartridge issued in a squad
that small, in a war that old.
 now the head englishman came into the hospital to check on billy. h

zy thought now occurred to billy. the truth of it startled him. it
would make a good epitaph for billy pilgrim-and for me, too.
 'would you talk about the war now, if i wanted you to?' said valencia. in a tiny cavity
in her great body she was assembling the materials for a green beret.
 'it would sound like a dream,' said billy. 'other people's dreams aren't very interesting
usually.'
 'i heard you tell father one time about a german firing squad.' she was referring to the
execution of poor old edgar derby.
 'um.'
 'you had to bury him? '
 'yes.'
 did he see you with your shovels before he was shot?'
 'yes.'
 'did he say anything?'
 'no.'
 'was he scared?'
 'they had him doped up. he was sort of glassy-eyed.'
 and they pinned a target to him?'

of the bathroom to take a leak. he groped for the light, realized as he felt the rough wall

cot next to billy's. billy was out of bed, groping along a wall, trying to find a way out
because he had to take a leak so badly.
 he suddenly found a door, which opened, let him reel out into the prison night. billy
was loony with time-travel and morphine. he delivered himself to a barbed-wire fence
which snagged him in a dozen places. billy tried to back away from it but the barbs
wouldn't let go. so billy did a silly little dance with the fence, taking a step this wa

 billy pilgrim says he went to dresden germany, on the day after his morphine night in
the british compound in the center of the extermination camp for russian prisoners of
war. billy woke up at dawn on that day in january. there were no windows in the little
hospital, and the ghostly candles had gone out. so the only light came from pin-prick
holes in the walls, and from a sketchy rectangle that outlined the imperfectly fitted door.
little paul lazzaro, with a broken arm, snored on one bed. edgar derby, the high school
teacher who would eventually he shot, snored on another.
 billy sat up in bed. he had no idea what year it was or what planet he was on.
whatever the planet's name was, it was cold. but it wasn't the cold that had awakened
billy. it was animal magnetism which was making him shiver and itch. it gave him
profound aches in his musculature, as though he had been exercising hard.
 the animal magnetism was coming from behind him. if billy had had to guess as to
the source, he would h

aid lazzaro. 'anybody touches me, he better kill me, or i'm
gonna have him killed.'
 the blue fairy godmother knew something about killing. he gave lazzaro a careful
smile. 'there is still time for me to kill you,' he said, 'if you really persuade me that it's the
sensible thing to do.'
 'why don't you go fuck yourself?'
 'don't think i haven't tried,' the blue fairy godmother answered.
 the blue fairy godmother left, amused and patronizing. when he was gone, lazzaro
promised billy and poor old edgar derby that he was going to have revenge, and that
revenge was sweet.
 'it's the sweetest thing there is,' said lazzaro. 'people fuck with me,' he said, 'and jesus
christ are they ever fucking sorry. i laugh like hell. i don't care if it's a guy or a dame. if
the president of the united states fucked around with me, i'd fix him good. you should
have seen what i did to a dog one time.'
 'a dog?' said billy.
 'son of a bitch bit me. so i got me some steak, and i got me the spring out of a clock. i

r your own guts out, boy. that's me in
there with all those knives."' so it goes.
 'anybody ever asks you what the sweetest thing in life is-' said lazzaro, 'it's revenge.'
 when dresden was destroyed later on, incidentally, lazzaro did not exult. he didn't
have anything against the germans, he said. also, he said he liked to take his enemies
one at a time. he was proud of never having hurt an innocent bystander. 'nobody ever
got it from lazzaro,' he said, 'who didn't have it coming.'
 poor old edgar derby, the high school teacher, got into the conversation now. he
asked lazzaro if he planned to feed the blue fairy godmother clock springs and steak.
 'shit,' said lazzaro.
 'he's a pretty big man,' said derby, who, of course, was a pretty big man himself.
 'size don't mean a thing.'
 'you're going to shoot him?'
 'i'm gonna have him shot,' said lazzaro. 'he'll get home after the war. he'll be a big
hero. the dames'll be climbing all over him. he'll settle down. a couple of years'll go by.

airs of a high-powered laser gun. it is aimed at him
from the darkened press box. in the next moment, billy pilgrim is dead. so it goes.
 so billy experiences death for a while. it is simply violet light and a hum. there isn't
anybody else there. not even billy pilgrim is there.
 then he swings back into life again, all the way back to an hour after his life was
threatened by lazzaro-in 1945. he has been told to get out of his hospital bed and dress,
that he is well. he and lazzaro and poor old edgar derby are to join their fellows in the
theater. there they will choose a leader for themselves by secret ballot in a free election.
 billy and lazzaro and poor old edgar derby crossed the prison yard to the theater
now. billy was carrying his little coat as though it were a lady's muff. it was wrapped
around and round his hands. he was the central clown in an unconscious travesty of that
famous oil painting, 'the spirit of '76.'
 edgar derby was writing letters home in his head, telling his wife that

 'close the fucking door,' somebody said to billy. 'were you born i'm a barn?'
 billy closed it, took a hand from his muff, touched a stove. it was as cold as ice. the
stage was still set for cinderella. azure curtains hung from the arches which were
shocking pink. there were golden thrones and the dummy clock, whose hands were set at
midnight. cinderella's slippers, which were a man's boots painted silver, were capsized
side by side under a golden throne.
 billy and poor old edgar derby and lazzaro had been in the hospital when the british
passed out blankets and mattresses, so they had none. they had to improvise. the only
space open to them was up on the stage, and they went up there, pulled the azure curtains
down, made nests.
 billy, curled in his azure nest, found himself staring at cinderella's silver boots under a
throne. and then he remembered that his shoes were ruined, that he needed boots. he
hated to get out of his nest, but he forced himself to do it. he crawled t

 'you needn't worry about bombs, by the way. dresden is an open city. it is undefended,
and contains no war industries or troop concentrations of any importance.'
 somewhere in there, old edgar derby was elected head american. the englishman
called for nominations from the floor, and there weren't any. so he nominated derby,
praising him for his maturity and long experience in dealing with people. there were no
further nominations, so the nominations were closed.
 'all in favor?'
 two or three people said, 'aye.'
 then poor old derby made a speech. he thanked the englishman for his good advice,
said he meant to follow it exactly. he said he was sure that all the other americans would
do the

 the americans began to feel much better. they were able to hold their food. and then
it was time to go to dresden. the americans marched fairly stylishly out of the british
compound. billy pilgrim again led the parade. he had silver boots now, and a muff, and a
piece of azure curtain which he wore like a toga. billy still had a beard. so did poor old
edgar derby, who was beside him. derby was imagining letters to home, his lips
working tremulously.
 dear margaret-we are leaving for dresden today. don't worry. it will never be
bombed. it is an open city. there was an election at noon, and guess what? and so on.
 they came to the prison railroad yard again. they had arrived on only two cars. they
would depart far more comfortably on four. they saw the dead hobo again. he was
frozen stiff in the weeds beside the track. he was in a fetal position, trying e

an artificial leg, and carried not only a loaded rifle but a cane. still they were
expected to earn obedience and respect from tall cocky, murderous american
infantrymen who had just come from all the killing of the front.
 and then they saw bearded billy pilgrim in his blue toga and silver shoes, with his
hands in a muff. he looked at least sixty years old. next to billy was little paul lazzaro
with a broken arm. he was fizzing with rabies. next to lazzaro was the poor old high
school teacher, edgar derby, mournfully pregnant with patriotism and middle age and
imaginary wisdom. and so on.
 the eight ridiculous dresdeners ascertained that these hundred ridiculous creatures
really were american fighting men fresh from the front. they smiled, and then they
laughed. their terror evaporated. there was nothing to be afraid of. here were more
crippled human beings, more fools like themselves. here was light opera.
 so out of the gate of the railroad yard and into the streets of dresden marched the ligh

he supposed that they were part of an
amazing new phase of the second world war. it was all right with him. everything was
pretty much all right with billy.
 he was taken to a small private hospital. a famous brain surgeon came up from boston
and operated on him for three hours. billy was unconscious for two days after that, and
he dreamed millions of things, some of them true. the true things were time-travel.
 one of the true things was his first evening in the slaughterhouse. he and poor old
edgar derby were pushing an empty two-wheeled cart down a dirt lane between empty
pens for animals. they were going to a communal kitchen for supper for all. they were
guarded by a sixteen-year-old german named werner gluck. the axles of the cart were
greased with the fat of dead animals. so it goes.
 the sun had just gone down, and its afterglow was backlighting the city, which formed
low cliffs around the bucolic void to the idle stockyards. the city was blacked out
because bombers might come, so billy d

but one woman who had
been waiting for them impatiently. she was a war widow. so it goes. she had her hat and
coat on. she wanted to go home, too, even though there wasn't anybody there. her white
gloves were laid out side by side on the zinc counter top.
 she had two big cans of soup for the americans. it was simmering over low fires on
the gas range. she had stacks of loaves of black bread, too.
 she asked gluck if he wasn't awfully young to be in the army. he admitted that he
was.
 she asked edgar derby if he wasn't awfully old to be in the army. he said he was.
 she asked billy pilgrim what he was supposed to be. billy said he didn't know. he was
just trying to keep warm.
 'all the real soldiers are dead,' she said. it was true. so it goes.
 another true thing that billy saw while he was unconscious in vermont was the work
that he and the others had to do in dresden during the month before the city was
destroyed. they washed windows and swept floors and cleaned lavatories and put jars

 billy spooned it on his second day. there were spoons hidden all over the factory, on
rafters, in drawers, behind radiators, and so on. they had been hidden in haste by persons
who had been spooning syrup, who had heard somebody else coming. spooning was a
crime.
 on his second day, billy was cleaning behind a radiator and he found a spoon. to his
back was a vat of syrup that was cooling. the only other person who could see billy and
his spoon was poor old edgar derby, who was washing a window outside. the spoon
was a tablespoon. billy thrust it into the vat, turned it around and around, making a gooey
lollipop. he thrust it into his mouth.
 a moment went by, and then every cell in billy's body shook him with ravenous
gratitude and applause.
 there were diffident raps at the factory window. derby was out there, having seen all.
he wanted some syrup, too.
 so billy made a lollipop for him. he opened the window. he stuck the lollipop into

'just ask for wild bob.'
 lily rumfoord shuddered, went on pretending to read the harry truman thing.
 billy's daughter barbara came in later that day. she was all doped up, had the same
glassy-eyed look that poor old edgar derby wore just before he was shot in dresden.
doctors had given her pills so she could continue to function, even though her father was
broken and her mother was dead.
 so it goes.
 she was accompanied by a doctor and a nurse. her brother robert was flying home
from a battlefield in vietnam. 'daddy,' she said tentatively. 'daddy? '
 but billy was ten years away, back in 1958. he was examining the eyes of a young
male mongolian idiot in order to prescribe corrective lenses. the idiot's mother was

 so a new technique was devised. bodies weren't brought up any more. they were

outside the shelters, simply sent the fire in.
 somewhere in there the poor old high school teacher, edgar derby, was caught with a
teapot he had taken from the catacombs. he was arrested for plundering. he was tried and
shot.
 so it goes.
and somewhere in there was springtime. the corpse mines were closed down. the
soldiers all left to fight the russians. in the suburbs, the women and children dug rifle
pits. billy and the rest of his group were locked up in the stable in the suburbs. and then,
one morning, they got up to discover that the door was unlocked. the second world war
in europe was over.
