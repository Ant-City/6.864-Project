about its head
and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;
he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.

"how now!" said scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.
"what do you want with me?"

"much!"--marley's voice, no doubt about it.

"who are you?"

"ask me who i was."

"who were you then?" said scrooge, raising his
voice. "you're particular, for a shade." he was going
to say "to a shade," but substituted this, as more
appropriate.

"in life i was your partner, jacob marley."

"can you--can you sit down?" asked scrooge, looking
doubtfully at him.

"i can."

"do it, then."

scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know
whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in
a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event
of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity
of an embarrassing explanation. but the ghost sat
down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he
were quite used to it.

"you don't believe in me," observed th

pattern strange to you?"

scrooge trembled more and more.

"or would you know," pursued the ghost, "the
weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?
it was full as heavy and as long as this, seven
christmas eves ago. you have laboured on it, since.
it is a ponderous chain!"

scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the
expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty
or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see
nothing.

"jacob," he said, imploringly. "old jacob marley,
tell me more. speak comfort to me, jacob!"

"i have none to give," the ghost replied. "it comes
from other regions, ebenezer scrooge, and is conveyed
by other ministers, to other kinds of men. nor
can i tell you what i would. a very little more is
all permitted to me. i cannot rest, i cannot stay, i
cannot linger anywhere. my spirit never walked
beyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my
spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our
money-changing hole; and weary journeys

elaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank
into a heavy sleep.


stave iii:  the second of the three spirits

awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and
sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, scrooge had
no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the
stroke of one. he felt that he was restored to consciousness
in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding
a conference with the second messenger despatched to him
through jacob marley's intervention. but finding that he
turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which
of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put
them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down
again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. for
he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its
appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and
made nervous.

 spirit, stretching out
its hand towards the city. "slander those who tell it ye!
admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse.
and bide the end!"

"have they no refuge or resource?" cried scrooge.

"are there no prisons?" said the spirit, turning on him
for the last time with his own words. "are there no workhouses?"

the bell struck twelve.

scrooge looked about him for the ghost, and saw it not.
as the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the
prediction of old jacob marley, and lifting up his eyes,
beheld a solemn phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like
a mist along the ground, towards him.


stave iv:  the last of the spirits

the phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. when
it came near him, scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in
the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to
scatter gloom and mystery.

it was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed
its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible

last prayer to have his fate
reversed, he saw an alteration in the phantom's hood and dress.
it shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.


stave v:  the end of it

yes! and the bedpost was his own. the bed was his own,
the room was his own. best and happiest of all, the time
before him was his own, to make amends in!

"i will live in the past, the present, and the future!"
scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. "the spirits
of all three shall strive within me. oh jacob marley!
heaven, and the christmas time be praised for this! i say
it on my knees, old jacob; on my knees!"

he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions,
that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his
call. he had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the
spirit, and his face was wet with tears.

"they are not torn down," cried scrooge, folding one of
his bed-curtains in his arms, "they are not torn down, rings
and all. they are here--i am here--the shadows of the

am as happy as an angel, i am as merry as a schoolboy. i
am as giddy as a drunken man. a merry christmas to
everybody! a happy new year to all the world. hallo
here! whoop! hallo!"

he had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing
there: perfectly winded.

"there's the saucepan that the gruel was in!" cried
scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace.
"there's the door, by which the ghost of jacob marley
entered! there's the corner where the ghost of christmas
present, sat! there's the window where i saw the wandering
spirits! it's all right, it's all true, it all happened.
ha ha ha!"

really, for a man who had been out of practice for so
many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh.
the father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!

"i don't know what day of the month it is!" said
scrooge. "i don't know how long i've been among the
