de guiche is an opposing double to cyrano. he represents everything that cyrano would become if cyrano were to use his wit for flattery and social climbing. de guiche is a violent, vengeful, and bitter man. as the play’s villain, he constantly plans to have cyrano killed, and he is unafraid to admit it.
he serves as a symbol of misguided aristocracy and ineffective leadership. his troops do not respect him. they approve of him only late in the play, when he leads a complex military maneuver for the french and then helps rescue roxane from the dangers of battle. he does become a better person near the end of the play—a change stemming from cyrano’s remarkable example of kindness, heroism, and respectability.
