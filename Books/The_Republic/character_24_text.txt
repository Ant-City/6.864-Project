er than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are
scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?

there i think that you are right.

and our philosopher follows the same analogy--he is like a plant which,
having proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue,
but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most noxious of
all weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power. do you really
think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted by sophists,
or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth
speaking of? are not the public who say these things the greatest of all
sophists? and do they not educate to perfection young and old, men and
women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?

when is this accomplished? he said.

when they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or in
a court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular resort,
and there is a great uproar, and they praise som

the overwhelming flood of popular opinion? or will he be carried away
by the stream? will he not have the notions of good and evil which the
public in general have--he will do as they do, and as they are, such
will he be?

yes, socrates; necessity will compel him.

and yet, i said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not been
mentioned.

what is that?

the gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death, which, as you
are aware, these new sophists and educators, who are the public, apply
when their words are powerless.

indeed they do; and in right good earnest.

now what opinion of any other sophist, or of any private person, can be
expected to overcome in such an unequal contest?

none, he replied.

no, indeed, i said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly;
there neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different
type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that
which is supplied by publi

c opinion--i speak, my friend, of human virtue
only; what is more than human, as the proverb says, is not included:
for i would not have you ignorant that, in the present evil state of
governments, whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power
of god, as we may truly say.

i quite assent, he replied.

then let me crave your assent also to a further observation.

what are you going to say?

why, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call sophists
and whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing
but the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their
assemblies; and this is their wisdom. i might compare them to a man who
should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is
fed by him--he would learn how to approach and handle him, also at what
times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse, and what
is the meaning of his several cries, and by what sounds, when another
utters th
