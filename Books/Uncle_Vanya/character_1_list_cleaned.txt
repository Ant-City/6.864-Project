[CHARACTER]([CHARACTER])  - 
      plagued by gout and rheumatism, the pompous and egotistical serebryakov is a failed scholar, deeply embittered by the onset of old age. he finds himself detestable in his infirmity and bemoans his residence in the provinces and his tomb-like estate, tormented by the meaningless chatter and indifference of his family. notably he is terrified by his brother-in-law voynitsky, perhaps betraying some latent remorse at having exploited him for his livelihood. in any case, serebryakov is quick to cover over tensions in the household and reassert his preeminence. votnitsky names him his "bitterest enemy."
