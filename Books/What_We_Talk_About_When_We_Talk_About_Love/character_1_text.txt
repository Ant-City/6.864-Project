who to look for if something happened to him."

terri drank from her glass.  she said, "but mel's right--we lived like fugitives. we were afraid.
mel was, weren't you, honey? i even called the police at one point, but they were no help. they
said they couldn't do anything until ed actually did something. isn't that a laugh?" terry said.

she poured the last of the gin into her glass and waggled the bottle.  mel got up from the table
and went to the cupboard. he took down another bottle.

"well, nick and i know what hove is," laura said. "for us, i mean," laura said. she bumped my
knee with her knee. "you're supposed to say something now," laura said, and turned her smile

for an answer, i took laura's hand and raised it to my lips. i made a big production out of
kissing her hand. everyone was amused.

"we're lucky," i said.

said, "you guys are our pals," mel said.  he picked up his glass.

mel said, "i was going to tell you about something.   i mean, i was going to prove a point.  you
see, this happened a few months ago, but it's still going on right now, and it ought to make us

“tell your story,” terri said.  “then we’ll go to that new place, okay?”

“okay,” mel said.  “where was i?” he said.  he stared at the table and then he began again.

“i dropped in to see each of them every day, sometimes twice a day if i was up doing other calls
anyway.  casts and bandages, head to foot, the both of them.  you know, you’ve seen it in the
