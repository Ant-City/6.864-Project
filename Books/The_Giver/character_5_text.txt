 me that it might enhance his nurturing if i
could call him by a name. just privately, of course, when no one
else is around."

"did you find it?" jonas asked. he was fascinated. it didn't seem a
terribly important rule, but the fact that his father had broken a rule
at all awed him. he glanced at his mother, the one responsible for
adherence to the rules, and was relieved that she was smiling.

his father nodded. "his name-if he makes it to the naming without
being released, of course-is to be gabriel. so i whisper that to him
when i feed him every four hours, and during exercise and




playtime. if no one can hear me.

"i call him gabe, actually," he said, and grinned. "gabe." jonas
tried it out. a good name, he decided. though jonas had only
become a five the year that they acquired lily and learned her
name, he remembered the excitement, the conversations at home,
wondering about her: how she would look, who she would be, how

she would fit into their established family unit. he re

ewchild onto his tummy in the basket. he sat beside it and
rubbed its small back with a rhythmic motion. "anyway, lily-billy,"
he said affectionately, "the birthmothers never even get to see
newchildren. if you enjoy the little ones so much, you should hope
for an assignment as nurturer."

"when you're an eight and start your volunteer hour, you can try
some at the nurturing center," mother suggested.

"yes, i think i will," lily said. she knelt beside the basket. "what did
you say his name is? gabriel? hello, gabriel," she said in a
singsong voice. then she giggled "ooops," she whispered. "i think
he's alseep. i guess i'd better be quiet."

jonas turned to the school assignments on his desk some chance
of that, he thought. lily was never quiet probably she should hope



for an assignment as speaker so that she could sit in the office with
the microphone all day, making announcements. he laughed
silently to himself, picturing his sister droning on in the self-
important

voice that a

t happened was the announcement
later that evening over the speaker, the announcement that had
singled him out without using his name, that had caused both of his
parents to glance meaningfully at his desk where the apple still lay.

now, sitting at his desk, staring at his schoolwork as his family
hovered over the newchild in its basket, he shook his head, trying
to forget the odd incident. he forced himself to arrange his papers
and try to study a little before the evening meal. the newchild,
gabriel, stirred and whimpered, and father spoke softly to lily,
explaining the feeding procedure as he opened the container that
held the formula and equipment.



the evening proceeded as all evenings did in the family unit, in the
dwelling, in the community: quiet, reflective, a time for renewal and
preparation for the day to come. it was different only in the addition
to it of the newchild with his pale, solemn, knowing eyes.

jonas rode at a leisurely pace, glancing at the bikeports beside

 herself. she leaned back and sighed with
pleasure, her head on a soft cushioned headrest.

"comfortable?" he asked, and she nodded, her eyes closed. jonas
squeezed cleansing lotion onto the clean sponge at the edge of the
tub and began to wash her frail body.

last night he had watched as his father bathed the newchild. this
was much the same: the fragile skin, the soothing water, the gentle
motion of his hand, slippery with soap. the relaxed, peaceful smile
on the woman's face reminded him of gabriel being bathed.

and the nakedness, too. it was against the rules for children or
adults to look at another's nakedness; but the rule did not apply to
newchildren or the old. jonas was glad. it was a nuisance to keep
oneself covered while changing for games, and the required
apology if one had by mistake glimpsed another's body was always
awkward. he couldn't see why it was necessary. he liked the
feeling of safety here in this warm and quiet room; he liked the
expression of trust on the woman's

the nurturers' section at the front; coming from it were
the wails and howls of the newchildren who sat squirming on the
nurturers' laps. at every other public ceremony, the audience was
silent and attentive. but once a year, they all smiled indulgently at
the commotion from the little ones waiting to receive their names
and families.

jonas finally caught his father's eye and waved. father grinned and
waved back, then held up the hand of the newchild on his lap,
making it wave, too.

it wasn't gabriel. gabe was back at the nurturing center today,
being cared for by the night crew. he had been given an unusual
and special reprieve from the committee, and granted an additional
year of nurturing before his naming and placement. father had
gone before the committee with a plea on behalf of gabriel, who
had not yet gained the weight appropriate to his days of life nor
begun to sleep soundly enough at night to be placed with his family
unit. normally such a newchild would be labeled inadequate and
 
 ___________________________
 

released from the community.

instead, as a result of father's plea, gabriel had been labeled
uncertain and given the additional year. he would continue to be
nurtured at the center and would spend his nights with jonas's
family unit. each family member, including lily, had been required
to sign a pledge that they would not become attached to this little
temporary guest, and that they would relinquish him without protest



or appeal when he was assigned to his own family unit at next
year's ceremony.

at least, jonas thought, after gabriel was placed next year, they

part of the community. if he were released, they would not see him
again. ever. those who were released-even as newchildren-were
sent elsewhere and never returned to the community.

father had not had to release a single newchild this year, so
gabriel would have represented a real failure and sadness. even
jonas, though he didn't hover over the little one the way lily and his
father did, was glad that gabe had not been released.

the first ceremony began right on time, and jonas watched as one
after another each newchild was given a name and handed by the
nurturers to its new family unit. for some, it was a first child. but
many came to the stage accompanied by another child beaming
with pride to receive a little brother or sister, the way j

newchildren. but it was rare that there was such an age gap
between children in a family unit.



when her family's ceremony was completed, fiona took the seat
that had been saved for her in the row ahead of asher and jonas.
she turned and whispered to them, "he's cute. but i don't like his
name very much." she made a face and giggled. fiona's new
brother had been



44



named bruno. it wasn't a great name, jonas thought, like-well, like
gabriel, for example. but it was okay.

the audience applause, which was enthusiastic at each naming,
rose in an exuberant swell when one parental pair, glowing with
pride, took a male newchild and heard him named caleb.

this new caleb was a replacement child. the couple had lost their
first caleb, a cheerful little four. loss of a child was very, very rare.
the community was extraordinarily safe, each citizen watchful and
protective of all children. but somehow the first little caleb had

pockets, indicating that she was mature enough now to keep track
of her own small belongings. she stood solemnly listening to the
speech of firm instructions on the responsibilities of eight and doing
volunteer hours for the first time. but jonas could see that lily,
though she seemed attentive, was looking longingly at the row of
gleaming bicycles, which would be presented tomorrow morning to
the nines.

next year, lily-billy, jonas thought.

it was an exhausting day, and even gabriel, retrieved in his basket
from the nurturing center, slept soundly that night.

finally it was the morning of the ceremony of twelve.

now father sat beside mother in the audience. jonas could see
them applauding dutifully as the nines, one by one, wheeled their
new bicycles, each with its gleaming nametag attached to the back,
from the stage. he knew that his parents cringed a little, as he did,
when fritz, who lived in the dwelling next door to theirs, received

dismounting by his door as asher continued on.

"right! see you!" asher called back. once again, there was just a
moment when things weren't quite the same, weren't quite as they
had always been through the long friendship. perhaps he had
imagined it. things couldn't change, with asher.

the evening meal was quieter than usual. lily chattered about her
plans for volunteer work; she would begin, she said, at the
nurturing center, since she was already an expert at feeding
gabriel.

"i know," she added quickly, when her father gave her a warning
glance, "i won't mention his name. i know i'm not supposed to know
his name.



"i can't wait for tomorrow to come," she said happily.
jonas sighed uneasily. "i can," he muttered.


"you've been greatly honored," his mother said. "your father and i
are very proud."

"it's the most important job in the community," father said.

"but just the other night, you said that the job of making
assignments was the most important!"

the man had sat back down in the comfortable upholstered chair.
he moved his shoulders around as if to ease away an aching
sensation. he seemed terribly weary.

"call me the giver," he told jonas.

"you slept soundly, jonas?" his mother asked at the morning meal.
"no dreams?"

jonas simply smiled and nodded, not ready to lie, not willing to tell
the truth. "i slept very soundly," he said.

"i wish this one would," his father said, leaning down from his chair
to touch gabriel's waving fist. the basket was on the floor beside
him; in its corner, beside gabriel's head, the smiled hippo sat
staring with its blank eyes.

"so do i," mother said, rolling her eyes. "he's so fretful at night."

jonas had not heard the newchild during the night because as
always, he had slept soundly. but it was not true that he had no
dreams.

again and again, as he slept, he had slid down that snow-covered
hill. always, in the dream, it seemed as if there were a destination:
a something- h

he looked down at himself, at the colorless fabric of his clothing.
"but it's all the same, always."

then he laughed a little. "i know it's not important, what you wear. it
doesn't matter. but--"

"it's the choosing that's important, isn't it?" the giver asked him.

jonas nodded. "my little brother--" he began, and then corrected
himself. "no, that's inaccurate. he's not my brother, not really. but
this newchild that my family takes care of-- his name's gabriel?"

"yes, i know about gabriel."

"well, he's right at the age where he's learning so much. he grabs
toys when we hold them in front of him-my father says he's
learning small-muscle control. and he's really cute."

the giver nodded.

"but now that i can see colors, at least sometimes, i was just
thinking: what if we could hold up things that were bright red, or



bright yellow, and he could choose? instead of the sameness."

"he might make wrong choices."

"oh." jonas was silent for a minute. "

ather asked at the evening meal.
"you're so quiet tonight. aren't you feeling well? would you like
some medication?"

but jonas remembered the rules. no medication for anything
related to his training.

and no discussion of his training. at the time for sharing-of-feelings,
he simply said that he felt tired, that his school lessons had been
unusually demanding that day.

he went to his sleepingroom early, and from behind the closed door
he could hear his parents and sister laughing as they gave gabriel
his evening bath.

they have never known pain, he thought. the realization made him
feel desperately lonely, and he rubbed his throbbing leg. he
eventually slept. again and again he dreamed of the anguish and
the isolation on the forsaken hill.

the daily training continued, and now it always included pain. the
agony of the fractured leg began to seem no more than a mild
discomfort as the giver led jonas firmly, little by little, into the deep
and terrible suffering of the past. each time, in h

"some years ago," the giver told him, "before your birth, a lot of
citizens petitioned the committee of elders. they wanted to
increase the rate of births. they wanted each birthmother to be
assigned four births instead of three, so that the population would
increase and there would be more laborers available."

jonas nodded, listening. "that makes sense."

"the idea was that certain family units could accommodate an
additional child."

jonas nodded again. "mine could," he pointed out. "we have
gabriel this year, and it's fun, having a third child."

"the committee of elders sought my advice," the giver said. "it
made sense to them, too, but it was a new idea, and they came to
me for wisdom."

"and you used your memories?"



the giver said yes. "and the strongest memory that came was
hunger. it came from many generations back. centuries back. the
population had gotten so big that hunger was everywhere.
excruciating hunger and starvation. it was followed by warfare."

warfare? it was a concep

smile.

"why can't we just apply for a change of rules?" jonas suggested.

the giver laughed; then jonas, too, chuckled reluctantly.

"the decision was made long before my time or yours," the giver



said, "and before the previous receiver, and--" he waited.

"back and back and back." jonas repeated the familiar phrase.
sometimes it had seemed humorous to him. sometimes it had
seemed meaningful and important.

now it was ominous. it meant, he knew, that nothing could be
changed.

the newchild, gabriel, was growing, and successfully passed the
tests of maturity that the nurturers gave each month; he could sit
alone, now, could reach for and grasp small play objects, and he
had six teeth. during the daytime hours, father reported, he was
cheerful and seemed



114



of normal intelligence. but he remained fretful at night, whimpering
often, needing frequent attention.

"after all this extra time i've put in with him," father said one
evening after gabriel had been bathed and was lying, for th

e
moment, hugging his hippo placidly in the small crib that had
replaced the basket, "i hope they're not going to decide to release
him."

"maybe it would be for the best," mother suggested. "i know you
don't mind getting up with him at night. but the lack of sleep is
awfully hard for me."

"if they release gabriel, can we get another newchild as a visitor?"
asked lily. she was kneeling beside the crib, making funny faces at
the little one, who was smiling back at her.

jonas's mother rolled her eyes in dismay.



"no," father said, smiling. he ruffled lily's hair. "it's very rare,
anyway, that a newchild's status is as uncertain as gabriel's. it
probably won't happen again, for a long time.

"anyway," he sighed, "they won't make the decision for a while.

 bathed. he remembered her sparkling eyes, her soft
voice, her low chuckle. fiona had told him recently that larissa had
been released at a wonderful ceremony.

but he knew that the old were not given children to raise. larissa's
life elsewhere would be quiet and serene as befit the old; she
would not welcome the responsibility of nurturing a newchild who
needed feeding and care, and would likely cry at night.




"mother? father?" he said, the idea coming to him unexpectedly,
"why don't we put gabriel's crib in my room tonight? i know how to
feed and comfort him, and it would let you and father get some
sleep."

father looked doubtful. "you sleep so soundly, jonas. what if his
restlessness didn't wake you?"

it was lily who answered that. "if no one goes to tend gabriel," she
pointed out, "he gets very loud. he'd wake all of us, if jonas slept
through it."

father laughed. "you're right, lily-billy. all right, jonas, let's try it,
just for tonight. i'll take the night off and we'll let mothe

gabriel slept soundly for the earliest part of the night. jonas, in his
bed, lay awake for a while; from time to time he raised himself on
one elbow, looking over at the crib.

the newchild was on his stomach, his arms relaxed beside his
head, his eyes closed, and his breathing regular and
undisturbed. finally jonas slept too.

then, as the middle hours of the night approached, the noise of
gabe's restlessness woke jonas. the newchild was turning under
his cover, flailing his arms, and beginni

ng to whimper.

jonas rose and went to him. gently he patted gabriel's back.
sometimes that was all it took to lull him back to sleep. but the
newchild still squirmed fretfully under his hand.

still patting rhythmically, jonas began to remember the wonderful



sail that the giver had given him not long before: a bright, breezy
day on a clear turquoise lake, and above him the white sail of the
boat billowing as he moved along in the brisk wind.

he was not aware of giving the memory; but suddenly he realized
that it was becoming dimmer, that it was sliding thro

ugh his hand
into the being of the newchild. gabriel became quiet. startled,
jonas pulled back what was left of the memory with a burst of will.
he removed his hand from the little back and stood quietly beside
the crib.

to himself, he called the memory of the sail forward again. it was
still there, but the sky was less blue, the gentle motion of the boat
slower, the water of the lake more murky and clouded. he kept it for
a while, soothing his own nervousness at what had occurred, then
let it go and returned to his bed.

once more, toward dawn,

 the newchild woke and cried out. again
jonas went to him. this time he quite deliberately placed his hand
firmly on gabriel's back, and



117



released the rest of the calming day on the lake. again gabriel
slept.

but now jonas lay awake, thinking. he no longer had any more
than a wisp of the memory, and he felt a small lack where it had
been. he could ask the giver for another sail, he knew. a sail
perhaps on ocean, next time, for jonas had a memory of ocean,
now, and knew what it was; he knew that there were sailboats
there, too, in memories yet to be acquired.

he wondered, though, if he should confess to the giver that he
had given a memory away. he was not yet qualified to be a giver

that he had this power frightened him. he decided not to tell.

jonas entered the annex room and realized immediately that it was
a day when he would be sent away. the giver was rigid in his
chair, his face in his hands.

"i'll come back tomorrow, sir," he said quickly. then he hesitated.
"unless maybe there's something i can do to help."

the giver looked up at him, his face contorted with suffering.
"please," he gasped, "take some of the pain."

thing as meaningful as the memory.

"and of course our community can't function smoothly if people
don't use precise language. you could ask, 'do you enjoy me?' the
answer is 'yes,' " his mother said.

"or," his father suggested, " 'do you take pride in my
accomplishments?' and the answer is wholeheartedly 'yes.' "

"do you understand why it's inappropriate to use a word like 'love'?"
mother asked.

jonas nodded. "yes, thank you, i do," he replied slowly.

it was his first lie to his parents.

"gabriel?" jonas whispered that night to the newchild. the crib was
in his room again. after gabe had slept soundly in jonas's room for
four nights, his parents had pronounced the experiment a success
and jonas a hero. gabriel was growing rapidly, now crawling and
giggling across the room and pulling himself up to stand. he could



128



be upgraded in the nurturing center, father said happily, now that
he slept; he could be officially named and given to his family in
december, which was only two mont

hs away.

but when he was taken away, he stopped sleeping again, and cried
in the night.

so he was back in jonas's sleepingroom. they would give it a little
more time, they decided. since gabe seemed to like it in jonas's
room, he would sleep there at night a little longer, until the habit of
sound sleep was fully formed. the nurturers were very optimistic



about gabriel's future.

there was no answer to jonas's whisper. gabriel was sound
asleep.

"things could change, gabe," jonas went on. "things could be
different. i don't know how, but there must be some way for things
to be different. there could be colors.

"and grandparents," he added, staring through the dimness toward
the ceiling of his sleepingroom. "and everybody would have the
memories.

"you know about memories," he whispered, turning toward the crib.

gabriel's breathing was even and deep. jonas liked having him
there, though he felt guilty about the secr

et. each night he gave
memories to gabriel: memories of boat rides and picnics in the sun;
memories of soft rainfall against windowpanes; memories of
dancing barefoot on a damp lawn.

"gabe?"

the newchild stirred slightly in his sleep. jonas looked over at him.



129



"there could be love," jonas whispered.

the next morning, for the first time, jonas did not take his pill.
something within him, something that had grown there through the
memories, told him to throw the pill away.

as he slept. but he knew he couldn't go back to the world of no
feelings that he had lived in so long.

and his new, heightened feelings permeated a greater realm than
simply his sleep. though he knew that his failure to take the pills
accounted for some of it, he thought that the feelings came also
from the memories. now he could see all of the colors; and he


could /ceepthem, too, so that the trees and grass and bushes
stayed green in his vision. gabriel's rosy cheeks stayed pink, even
when he slept. and apples were always, always red.

now, through the memories, he had seen oceans and mountain
lakes and streams that gurgled through woods; and now he saw the
familiar wide river beside the path differently. he saw all of the light
and color and history it contained and carried in its slow-moving
water; and he knew that there was an elsewhere from which it
came, and an elsewhere to which it was going.

on this unexpected, casual holiday he felt h
 
 ___________________________
 

he could change nothing.

back in their dwelling, that evening, lily chattered merrily about the
wonderful holiday she had had, playing with her friends, having her
midday meal out of doors, and (she confessed) sneaking a very
short try on her father's bicycle.

"i can't wait till i get my very own bicycle next month. father's is too
big for me. i fell," she explained matter-of-factly.

"good thing gabe wasn't in the child seat!"

"a very good thing," mother agreed, frowning at the idea of it.
gabriel waved his arms at the mention of himself. he had begun to
walk just the week before. the first steps of a newchild were always
the occasion for celebration at the nurturing center, father said,
but also for the introduction of a discipline wand. now father
brought the slender instrument home with him each night, in case
gabriel misbehaved.

but he was a happy and easygoing toddler. now he moved
unsteadily across the room, laughing. "gay!" he chirped. "gay!" it
was the way he said his own name.

 tonight," father said. "tomorrow's a
busy day for me. the twins are being born tomorrow, and the test
results show that they're identical."

"one for here, one for elsewhere," lily chanted. "one for here, one
for else--"

"do you actually take it elsewhere, father?" jonas asked.

"no, i just have to make the selection. i weigh them, hand the larger



waiting, and then i get the smaller one all cleaned up and comfy.
then i perform a small ceremony of release and--" he glanced
down, grinning at gabriel. "then i wave bye-bye," he said, in the
special sweet voice he used when he spoke to the newchild. he
waved his hand in the familiar gesture.

gabriel giggled and waved bye-bye back to him.

"and somebody else comes to get him? somebody from
elsewhere?"

"that's right, jonas-bonus."

jonas rolled his eyes in embarrassment that his father had used
the silly pet name.

lily was deep in thought. "what if they give the little twin a name
elsewhere, a name like, oh, maybe jonathan? and here, in our

then we'd have a problem. but this one," he handed one, after
rewrapping it, to his assistant, "is six pounds even. so you can
clean him up and dress him and take him over to the center."

the woman took the newchild and left through the door she had
entered.

jonas watched as his father bent over the squirming newchild on
the bed. "and you, little guy, you're only five

pounds ten ounces. a s hrimp!"

"that's the special voice he uses with gabriel," jonas remarked,
smiling.

"watch," the giver said.

"now he cleans him up and makes him comfy," jonas told him. "he
told me."

"be quiet, jonas," the giver commanded in a strange voice. "



watch ."

obediently jonas concentrated on the screen, waiting for what
would happen next. he was especially curious about the ceremony
part.

his father turned and opened the cupboard. he took out a syringe
and a small bottle. very carefully he inserted the needle into the
bottle and began to fill the sy

 but he felt a very deep sadness that he had
left his closest friend behind. he knew that in the danger of his
escape he must be absolutely silent; but with his heart and mind,
he called back and hoped that with his capacity for hearing-beyond,
the giver would know that jonas had said goodbye.



it had happened at the evening meal. the family unit was eating
together as always: lily chattering away, mother and father making
their customary comments (and lies, jonas knew) about the day.
nearby, gabriel played happily on the floor, babbling his baby talk,
looking with glee now and then toward jonas, obviously delighted
to have him back after the unexpected night away from the
dwelling.

father glanced down toward the toddler. "enjoy it, little guy," he
said. "this is your last night as visitor."

"what do you mean?" jonas asked him.

father sighed with disappointment. "well, you know he wasn't here
when you got home this morning because we had him stay
overnight at the nurturing center. it see

, to give it a try. he'd been sleeping so
soundly."

"didn't it go well?" mother asked sympathetically.

father gave a rueful laugh. "that's an understatement. it was a
disaster. he cried all night, apparently. the night crew couldn't
handle it. they were really frazzled by the time i got to work."

"gabe, you naughty thing," lily said, with a scolding little cluck
toward the grinning toddler on the floor.

"so," father went on, "we obviously had to make the



165



decision. even i voted for gabriel's release when we had the
meeting this afternoon."

jonas put down his fork and stared at his father. "release?" he

asked.

father nodded. "we certainly gave it our best try, didn't we?"

"yes, we did," mother agreed emphatically.

lily nodded in agreement, too.

jonas worked at keeping his voice absolutely calm. "when?" he
asked. "when will he be released?"

"first thing tomorrow morning. we have to start our preparations for
the naming ceremony, so we thought we'd get this taken care of

serious crime, even though what he had taken was leftovers, set


out on the dwelling doorsteps for collection.

third, he had stolen his father's bicycle. he had hesitated for a
moment, standing beside the bikeport in the darkness, not wanting
anything of his father's and uncertain, as well, whether he could
comfortably ride the larger bike when he was so accustomed to his
own.

but it was necessary because it had the child seat attached to the
back.

and he had taken gabriel, too.

he could feel the little head nudge his back, bouncing gently
against him as he rode. gabriel was sleeping soundly, strapped
into the seat. before he had left the dwelling, he had laid his hands
firmly on gabe's back and transmitted to him the most soothing
memory he could: a slow-swinging hammock under palm trees on
an island someplace, at evening, with a rhythmic sound of languid
water lapping hypnotically against a beach nearby. as the memory
seeped from him into the newchild, he coul

aware of his escape. so he rode hard, steadily, willing
himself not to tire as the minutes and miles passed. there had
been no time to receive the memories he and the giver had
counted on, of strength and courage. so he relied on what he had,
and hoped it would be enough.

he circled the outlying communities, their dwellings



dark. gradually the distances between communities widened, with
longer stretches of empty road. his legs ached at first; then, as time
passed, they became numb.

at dawn gabriel began to stir. they were in an isolated place; fields
on either side of the road were dotted with thickets of trees here
and there. he saw a stream, and made his way to it across a rutted,
bumpy meadow; gabriel, wide awake now, giggled as the bicycle
jolted him up and down.

jonas unstrapped gabe, lifted him from the bike, and watched him
investigate the grass and twigs with delight. carefully he hid the
bicycle in thick bushes.

"morning meal, gabe!" he unwrapped some of the food and fed

both. then he filled the cup he had brought with water from
the stream and held it for gabriel to drink. he drank thirstily himself,
and sat by the stream, watching the newchild play.

he was exhausted. he knew he must sleep, resting his own
muscles and preparing himself for more hours on the bicycle. it
would not be safe to travel in daylight.

they would be looking for him soon.

he found a place deeply hidden in the trees, took the newchild
there, and lay down, holding gabriel in his arms. gabe struggled
cheerfully as if it were a wrestling game, the kind they had played
back in the dwelling, with tickles and laughter.

"sorry, gabe," jonas told him. "i know it's morning, and i know you
just woke up. but we have to sleep now.

he cuddled the small body close to him, and rubbed the little back.
he murmured to gabriel soothingly. then




he pressed his hands firmly and transmitted a memory of deep,
contented exhaustion. gabriel's head nodded, after a moment and
fell a

 thing was the planes. by now, days had passed;
jonas no longer knew how many. the journey had become
automatic: the sleep by days, hidden in underbrush and trees; the
finding of water; the careful division of scraps of food, augmented
by what he could find in the fields. and the endless, endless miles
on the bicycle by night.

his leg muscles were taut now. they ached when he settled
himself to sleep. but they were stronger, and he stopped now less
often to rest. sometimes he paused and lifted gabriel down for a
brief bit of exercise, running down the road or through a field
together in the dark. but always, when he returned, strapped the
uncomplaining toddler into the seat again, and remounted, his legs
were ready.

so he had enough strength of his own, and had not needed what
the giver might have provided, had there been time.

but when the planes came, he wished that he could have received
the courage.

he knew they were search planes. they flew so low that they woke
him with the noise of

 their engines, and sometimes, looking out and
up fearfully from the hiding places, he could almost see the faces of
the searchers.

he knew that they could not see color, and that their



flesh, as well as gabriel's light golden curls, would be no more than
smears of gray against the colorless foliage. but he remembered
from his science and technology studies at school that the search
planes used heat-seeking devices which could identify body
warmth and would hone in on two humans huddled in shrubbery.

so always, when he heard the aircraft sound, he reached to gabriel
and transmitted memories of snow, keeping some for himself.
together they became cold; and when the planes were gone, they
would shiver,

holding each other, until sleep came again.

sometimes, urging the memories into gabriel, jonas felt that they
were more shallow, a little weaker than they had been. it was what
he had hoped, and what he and the giver had planned: that as he
moved away from the community, he would shed the memories and
leave them behind for the people. but now, when he needed them,
when the planes came, he tried hard to cling to what he still had, of
cold, and to use it for their survival.

usually the aircraft came by day, when they were hiding. but he
was alert at night, too, on the road, always

listening intently for the
sound of the engines. even gabriel listened, and would call out,
"plane! plane!" sometimes before jonas had heard the terrifying
noise. when the aircraft searchers came, as they did occasionally,
during the night as they rode, jonas sped to the nearest tree or
bush, dropped to the ground, and made himself and gabriel cold.
but it was sometimes a frighteningly close call.

as he pedaled through the nights, through isolated landscape now,
with the communities far behind and no sign of human habitation
around him or ahead, he was




constantly vigilant, looking for the next nearest hiding place should
the sound of engines come.

but the frequency of the planes diminished. they came less often,
and flew, when they did come, less slowly, as if the search had
become haphazard and no longer hopeful. finally there

entire day and night when they did not come at all.


now the landscape was changing. it was a subtle change, hard to
identify at first. the road was narrower, and bumpy, apparently no
longer tended by road crews. it was harder, suddenly, to balance
on the bike, as the front wheel wobbled over stones and ruts.

one night jonas fell, when the bike jolted to a sudden stop against
a rock. he grabbed instinctively for gabriel; and the newchild,
strapped tightly in his seat, was uninjured, only frightened when the
bike fell to its side. but jonas's ankle was twisted, and his knees
were scraped and raw, blood seeping through his torn trousers.
painfully he righted himself and the bike, and reassured gabe.

tentatively he began to ride in daylight. he had forgotten the fear of
the searchers, who seemed to have diminished into the past. but
now there were new fears; the unfamiliar landscape held hidden,
unknown perils.

trees became more numerous, and the forests beside the road
were dark and thick with mystery. they saw streams more
frequently now and stopped often to drink. jonas carefully washed
his injured knees, wincing as he rubbed at the raw flesh. the



constant ache of his swollen ankle was eased when he soaked it
occasionally in the cold water that rushed through roadside gullies.


he was newly aware that gabriel's safety depended entirely upon
his own continued strength.

they saw their first waterfall, and for the first time wildlife.

"plane! plane!" gabriel called, and jonas turned swiftly into the
trees, though he had not seen planes in days, and he did not hear
an aircraft engine now. when he stopped the bicycle in the
shrubbery and turned to grab gabe, he saw the small chubby arm
pointing toward the sky.

terrified, he looked up, but it was not a plane at all. though he had
never seen one before,

 would starve. now
that they had left the cultivated fields

behind them, it was almost impossible to find food. they finished
the meager store of potatoes and carrots they had saved from the
last agricultural area, and now they were always hungry.

jonas knelt by a stream and tried without success to catch a fish
with his hands. frustrated, he threw rocks into the water, knowing
even as he did so that it was useless. finally, in desperation, he
fashioned a makeshift net, looping the strands of gabriel's blanket
around a curved stick.

after countless tries, the net yielded two flopping silvery fish.
methodically jonas hacked them to pieces with a sharp rock and
fed the raw shreds to himself and to gabriel. they ate some
berries, and tried without success to catch a bird.

at night, while gabriel slept beside him, jonas lay awake, tortured
by hunger, and remembered his life in the community where meals
were delivered to each dwelling every day.

he tried to use the flagging power of his memor

"starving." you have never

now he was. if he had stayed in the community, he


would not be. it was as simple as that. once he had yearned for
choice. then, when he had had a choice, he had made the wrong
one: the choice to leave. and now he was starving.

but if he had stayed ...

his thoughts continued. if he had stayed, he would have starved in
other ways. he would have lived a life hungry for feelings, for color,
for love.

and gabriel? for gabriel there would have been no life at all. so
there had not really been a choice.

it became a struggle to ride the bicycle as jonas weakened from
lack of food, and realized at the same time that he was
encountering something he had for a long time yearned to see:
hills. his sprained ankle throbbed as he forced the pedal downward
in an effort that was almost beyond him.

and the weather was changing. it rained for two days. jonas had
never seen rain, though he had experienced it often i

n the
memories. he had liked those rains, enjoyed the new feeling of it,
but this was different. he and gabriel became cold and wet, and it
was hard to get dry, even when sunshine occasionally followed.

gabriel had not cried during the long frightening journey. now he
did. he cried because he was hungry and cold and terribly weak.
jonas cried, too, for the same reasons, and another reason as well.
he wept because he was afraid now that he could not save gabriel.
he no longer cared about himself.



jonas felt more and more certain that the destination lay ahead of
him, very near now in the night that was approaching. none of his
senses confirmed it. he saw nothing ahead except the endless
ribbon of road unfolding in twisting narrow curves. he heard no
sound ahead.

yet he felt it: felt that elsewhere was not far away. but he had little
hope left that he would be able to reach it. his hope diminished
further when the sharp, cold air began to blur and t

swirling white.

gabriel, wrapped in his inadequate blanket, was hunched,
shivering, and silent in his little seat. jonas stopped the bike
wearily, lifted the child down, and realized with heartbreak how cold
and weak gabe had become.

standing in the freezing mound that was thickening around his
numb feet, jonas opened his own tunic, held gabriel to his bare
chest, and tied the torn and dirty blanket around them both. gabriel
moved feebly against him and whimpered briefly into the silence
that surrounded them.

dimly, from a nearly forgotten perception as blurred as the
substance itself, jonas recalled what the whiteness was.




"it's called snow, gabe," jonas whispered. "snowflakes. they fall
down from the sky, and they're very beautiful."

there was no response from the child who had once been so



curious and alert. jonas looked down through the dusk at the little
head against his chest. gabriel's curly hair wa

the bicycle. a steep hill loomed ahead. in the
best of conditions, the hill would have been a difficult, demanding
ride. but now the rapidly deepening snow obscured the narrow road
and made the ride impossible. his front wheel moved forward
imperceptibly as he pushed on the pedals with his numb,
exhausted legs. but the bicycle stopped. it would not move.

he got off and let it drop sideways into the snow. for a moment he
thought how easy it would be to drop beside it himself, to let himself
and gabriel slide into the softness of snow, the darkness of night,
the warm comfort of sleep. but he had come this far. he must try to
go on.

the memories had fallen behind him now, escaping from his
protection to return to the people of his community. were there any
left at all? could he hold onto a last bit of warmth? did he still have
the strength to give? could gabriel still receive?

he pressed his hands into gabriel's back and tried to remember
sunshine. for a moment it seemed that nothing came to

 his frozen feet and legs. he felt his face begin to
glow and the tense, cold skin of his arms and hands relax. for a
fleeting second he felt that he wanted to keep it for himself, to let



himself bathe in sunlight, unburdened by anything or anyone else.

but the moment passed and was followed by an urge, a need, a
passionate yearning to share the warmth with the one person left
for him to love. aching from the effort, he forced the memory of
warmth into the thin, shivering body in his arms.

gabriel stirred. for a moment they both were bathed in warmth and
renewed strength as they stood hugging each other in the blinding
snow.

jonas began to walk up the hill.

the memory was agonizingly brief. he had trudged no more than a
few yards through the night when it was gone and they were cold
again.

but his mind was alert now. warming himself ever so briefly had
shaken away the lethargy and resignation and restored his will to
survive. he began to walk faster on feet that he could no longer

l. but the hill was treacherously steep; he was impeded by the
snow and his own lack of strength. he didn't make it very far before
he stumbled and fell forward.

on his knees, unable to rise, jonas tried a second time. his
consciousness grasped at a wisp of another warm memory, and
tried desperately to hold it there, to enlarge it, and pass it into
gabriel. his spirits and strength lifted with the momentary warmth
and he stood. again, gabriel stirred against him as he began to
climb.

but the memory faded, leaving him colder than before. if only he
had had time to receive more warmth from the giver before he


escaped! maybe there would be more left for him now. but there
was no purpose in if-onlys. his entire concentration now had to be
on moving his feet, warming gabriel and himself, and going
forward.

he climbed, stopped, and warmed them both briefly again, with a
tiny scrap of memory that seemed certainly to be all he

hausted; on the contrary, his steps
were leaden, and he could barely move his freezing, tired legs.

but he began, suddenly, to feel happy. he began to recall happy
times. he remembered his parents and his sister. he remembered
his friends, asher and fiona. he remembered the giver.

memories of joy flooded through him suddenly.

he reached the place where the hill crested and he could feel the
ground under his snow-covered feet become level. it would not be
uphill anymore.

"we're almost there, gabriel," he whispered, feeling quite certain
without knowing why. "i remember this place, gabe." and it was
true. but it was not a grasping of a thin and burdensome
recollection; this was different. this was something that he could
keep. it was a memory of his own.



he hugged gabriel and rubbed him briskly, warming him, to keep
him alive. the wind was bitterly cold. the snow swirled, blurring his
vision. but somewhere ahead, through the blinding storm, he knew
there was warmth and light.

using his

inside him, jonas found the sled that was waiting for them at the
top of the hill. numbly his hands fumbled for the rope.

he settled himself on the sled and hugged gabe close. the hill was
steep but the snow was powdery and soft, and he knew that this
time there would be no ice, no fall, no pain. inside his freezing
body, his heart surged with hope.

they started down.

jonas felt himself losing consciousness and with his whole being
willed himself to stay upright atop the sled, clutching gabriel,
keeping him safe. the runners sliced through the snow and the
wind whipped at his face as they sped in a straight line through an
incision that seemed to lead to the final destination, the place that
he had always felt was waiting, the elsewhere that held their future
and their past.

he forced his eyes open as they went downward, downward,
sliding, and all at once he could see lights, and he recognized them
now. he knew they were shining through the windows of rooms,
that they were the red, b
