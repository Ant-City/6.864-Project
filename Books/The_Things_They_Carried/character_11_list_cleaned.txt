[CHARACTER] - 
                	a
soldier in the alpha company and one of the few unsympathetic characters
in the work. every time [CHARACTER] appears, he is mean-spirited and cruel,
torturing vietnamese civilians and poking fun both at the corpses of
the enemy and the deaths of his own fellow soldiers. his humanity
is finally demonstrated near the end of the work, when he is forced
to help unearth kiowa's body from the muck of the sewage field.
this moment of remorse proves that a breaking point is possible
even for soldiers who use cruelty as a defense mechanism.
