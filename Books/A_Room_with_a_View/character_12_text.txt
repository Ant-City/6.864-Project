again now that ireland is all right. and as it is, the glass over our
front door was broken last election, and freddy is sure it was the
tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.â€

â€œshameful! a manufacturing district, i suppose?â€

â€œno--in the surrey hills. about five miles from dorking, looking over
the weald.â€

miss lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.

â€œwhat a delightful part; i know it so well. it is full of the very
nicest people. do you know sir harry otway--a radical if ever there
was?â€

â€œvery well indeed.â€

â€œand old mrs. butterworth the philanthropist?â€

â€œwhy, she rents a field of us! how funny!â€

miss lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: â€œoh, you
have property in surrey?â€

â€œhardly any,â€ said lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. â€œonly thirty
acres--just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.â€

miss lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her
auntâ€™s suffolk e

â€œpfui!â€

â€œi know,â€ said cecil. â€œi know. i canâ€™t think why mrs. honeychurch allows
it.â€

for cecil considered the bone and the maplesâ€™ furniture separately; he
did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the
life that he desired.

â€œiâ€™ve come for tea and for gossip. isnâ€™t this news?â€

â€œnews? i donâ€™t understand you,â€ said cecil. â€œnews?â€

mr. beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.

â€œi met sir harry otway as i came up; i have every reason to hope that i
am first in the field. he has bought cissie and albert from mr. flack!â€

â€œhas he indeed?â€ said cecil, trying to recover himself. into what a
grotesque mistake had he fallen! was it likely that a clergyman and a
gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant? but his
stiffness remained, and, though he asked who cissie and albert might be,
he still thought mr. beebe rather a bounder.

o sides, and the upper and third side was
occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled
spire. mr. beebeâ€™s house was near the church. in height it scarcely
exceeded the cottages. some great mansions were at hand, but they were
hidden in the trees. the scene suggested a swiss alp rather than the
shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly
little villas--the villas that had competed with cecilâ€™s engagement,
having been acquired by sir harry otway the very afternoon that lucy had
been acquired by cecil.

â€œcissieâ€ was the name of one of these villas, â€œalbertâ€ of the other.
these titles were not only picked out in shaded gothic on the garden
gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed
the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals. â€œalbertâ€
 was inhabited. his tortured garden was bright with geraniums and
lobelias and polished shells. his little windows were chastely swathed
in

fact. her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn
was yellow with dandelions.

â€œthe place is ruined!â€ said the ladies mechanically. â€œsummer street will
never be the same again.â€

as the carriage passed, â€œcissieâ€™sâ€ door opened, and a gentleman came out
of her.

â€œstop!â€ cried mrs. honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
â€œhereâ€™s sir harry. now we shall know. sir harry, pull those things down
at once!â€

sir harry otway--who need not be described--came to the carriage and
said â€œmrs. honeychurch, i meant to. i canâ€™t, i really canâ€™t turn out
miss flack.â€

â€œam i not always right? she ought to have gone before the contract was
signed. does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephewâ€™s time?â€

â€œbut what can i do?â€ he lowered his voice. â€œan old lady, so very vulgar,
and almost bedridden.â€

â€œturn her out,â€ said cecil bravely.

sir harry sighed, and looked at the villas mou

€œall that you say is quite true,â€ said lucy, though she felt
discouraged. â€œi wonder whether--whether it matters so very much.â€

â€œit matters supremely. sir harry is the essence of that garden-party.
oh, goodness, how cross i feel! how i do hope heâ€™ll get some vulgar
tenant in that villa--some woman so really vulgar that heâ€™ll notice
it. gentlefolks! ugh! with his bald head and retreating chin! but letâ€™s
forget him.â€

this lucy was glad enough to do. if cecil disliked sir harry otway and
mr. beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered
to her would escape? for instance, freddy. freddy was neither clever,
nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented cecil from saying, any
minute, â€œit would be wrong not to loathe freddyâ€? and what would she
reply? further than freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety
enough. she could only assure herself that cecil had known freddy some
time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps,

â€œcecil?â€ exclaimed lucy.

â€œdonâ€™t be rude, dear,â€ said his mother placidly. â€œlucy, donâ€™t screech.
itâ€™s a new bad habit youâ€™re getting into.â€

â€œbut has cecil--â€

â€œfriends of cecilâ€™s,â€ he repeated, â€œâ€˜and so really dee-sire-rebel. ahem!
honeychurch, i have just telegraphed to them.â€™â€

she got up from the grass.

it was hard on lucy. mr. beebe sympathized with her very much. while she
believed that her snub about the miss alans came from sir harry otway,
she had borne it like a good girl. she might well â€œscreechâ€ when
she heard that it came partly from her lover. mr. vyse was a
tease--something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure
in thwarting people. the clergyman, knowing this, looked at miss
honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.

when she exclaimed, â€œbut cecilâ€™s emersons--they canâ€™t possibly be the
same ones--there is that--â€ he did not consider that the exclamation
was strange, but saw in it an opp

chapter xi: in mrs. vyseâ€™s well-appointed flat

the comic muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not
disdain the assistance of mr. vyse. his idea of bringing the emersons to
windy corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the
negotiations without a hitch. sir harry otway signed the agreement,
met mr. emerson, who was duly disillusioned. the miss alans were
duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to lucy, whom they held
responsible for the failure. mr. beebe planned pleasant moments for the
new-comers, and told mrs. honeychurch that freddy must call on them as
soon as they arrived. indeed, so ample was the museâ€™s equipment that she
permitted mr. harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head,
to be forgotten, and to die.

â€œlet me introduce mr. honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at
florence.â€

â€œhow do you do? very glad to see you, and that you are taking george for
a bathe. very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry. marriage
is a duty. i am sure that she will be happy, for we know mr. vyse, too.
he has been most kind. he met us by chance in the national gallery, and
arranged everything about this delightful house. though i hope i have
not vexed sir harry otway. i have met so few liberal landowners, and
i was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the
conservative attitude. ah, this wind! you do well to bathe. yours is a
glorious country, honeychurch!â€

â€œnot a bit!â€ mumbled freddy. â€œi must--that is to say, i have to--have
the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, i hope.â€

â€œcall, my lad? who taught us that drawing-room twaddle? call on your
grandmother! listen to the wind among the pines! yours i
