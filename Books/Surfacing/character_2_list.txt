David - 
The psychologically abusive and womanizing husband of Anna. David is
a communications teacher who loves baseball. He is an amateur filmmaker
composing a film with Joe called Random Samples. David's
constant joking and imitation of cartoon characters serves as a poor cover for
his selfish and sexist behavior, and the manner in which he communicates with
Anna is deeply cruel. David is staunchly anti-American, yet he possesses all of
the awful qualities that the narrator associates with Americans.
