[CHARACTER] - 
                	the
straitlaced steward--or head servant--in the household of lady olivia.
[CHARACTER] is very efficient but also very self-righteous, and he
has a poor opinion of drinking, singing, and fun. his priggishness
and haughty attitude earn him the enmity of sir toby, sir andrew,
and maria, who play a cruel trick on him, making him believe that
olivia is in love with him. in his fantasies about marrying his
mistress, he reveals a powerful ambition to rise above his social
class.
