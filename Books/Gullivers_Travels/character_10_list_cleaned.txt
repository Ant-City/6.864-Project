[CHARACTER] - 
                the portuguese captain who takes gulliver back to
europe after he is forced to leave the land of the houyhnhnms. don
pedro is naturally benevolent and generous, offering the half-crazed
gulliver his own best suit of clothes to replace the tatters he
is wearing. but gulliver meets his generosity with repulsion, as
he cannot bear the company of yahoos. by the end of the voyage,
don pedro has won over gulliver to the extent that he is able to
have a conversation with him, but the captain's overall yahoolike
nature in gulliver's eyes alienates him from gulliver to the very
end.
