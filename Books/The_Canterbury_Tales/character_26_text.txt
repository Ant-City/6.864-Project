that when that one was dead, soothly to sayn,
his fellow went and sought him down in hell:

twelve books are disposed of in the few lines foregoing.

6. waimenting:  bewailing; german, "wehklagen"

from which he has freely borrowed in his poetry. the words are
"quis legem det amantibus?

("who can give law to lovers? love is a law unto himself, and
greater")

14. "perithous" and "theseus" must, for the metre, be
pronounced as words of four and three syllables respectively --
the vowels at the end not being diphthongated, but enunciated
separately, as if the words were printed pe-ri-tho-us, the-se-us.
the same rule applies in such words as "creature" and
"conscience," which are trisyllables.

15. stound: moment, short space of time; from anglo-saxon,

bacchus, and the muses.

42. it need not be said that chaucer pays slight heed to
chronology in this passage, where the deeds of turnus, the

memories of the far past in the time of fabulous theseus, the

notes to the cuckoo and the nightingale


1. these two lines occur also in the knight's tale; they
commence the speech of theseus on the love follies of palamon
and arcite, whom the duke has just found fighting in the forest.

2. a stronger reading is "all."

3. "ocy, ocy," is supposed to come from the latin "occidere,"
to kill; or rather the old french, "occire," "occis," denoting the
doom which the nightingale imprecates or supplicates on all
who do offence to love.

a twist in an rope -- and, as a verb, to twist or entangle.

35. they feel in times, with vapour etern: they feel in their
seasons, by the emission of an eternal breath or inspiration (that
god loves, &c.)

36. the idea of this stanza is the same with that developed in
the speech of theseus at the close of the knight's tale; and it is
probably derived from the lines of boethius, quoted in note 91
to that tale.

37. in this and the following lines reappears the noble doctrine
of the exalting and purifying influence of true love, advanced in
"the court of love," "the cuckoo and the nightingale," &c.

30. the same prohibition occurs in the fifteenth statute of "the

pursuits of gallantry; he does so prominently in "the court of
love," "the assembly of fowls," and "the house of fame."
