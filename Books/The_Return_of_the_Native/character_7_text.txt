fth of november, like other denizens of the heath?”
“i knew it was meant for me.”
“how did you know it? i have had no word with you since you—you chose her, and walked about with her, and deserted me entirely, as if i had never been yours life and soul so irretrievably!”
“eustacia! could i forget that last autumn at this same day of the month and at this same place you lighted exactly such a fire as a signal for me to come and see you? why should there have been a bonfire again by captain vye’s house if not for the same purpose?”
“yes, yes—i own it,” she cried under her breath, with a drowsy fervour of manner and tone which was quite peculiar to her. “don’t begin speaking to me as you did, damon; you will drive me to say words i would not wish to say to you. i had given you up, and resolved not to think of you any more; and then i heard the news, and i came out and got the fire ready because i thought that you had been faithful to me.”
“what have you heard to make

as soon as the sad little boy had withdrawn from the fire he clasped the money tight in the palm of his hand, as if thereby to fortify his courage, and began to run. there was really little danger in allowing a child to go home alone on this part of egdon heath. the distance to the boy’s house was not more than three-eighths of a mile, his father’s cottage, and one other a few yards further on, forming part of the small hamlet of mistover knap: the third and only remaining house was that of captain vye and eustacia, which stood quite away from the small cottages and was the loneliest of lonely houses on these thinly populated slopes.
he ran until he was out of breath, and then, becoming more courageous, walked leisurely along, singing in an old voice a little song about a sailor-boy and a fair one, and bright gold in store. in the middle of this the child stopped—from a pit under the hill ahead of him shone a light, whence proceeded a cloud of floating dust and a smacking noise.

i might come in without any fuss,” was answered in a lad’s pleasant voice.
“oh, did he?” said eustacia more gently. “what do you want, charley?”
“please will your grandfather lend us his fuelhouse to try over our parts in, tonight at seven o’clock?”
“what, are you one of the egdon mummers for this year?”
“yes, miss. the cap’n used to let the old mummers practise here.”
“i know it. yes, you may use the fuelhouse if you like,” said eustacia languidly.
the choice of captain vye’s fuelhouse as the scene of rehearsal was dictated by the fact that his dwelling was nearly in the centre of the heath. the fuelhouse was as roomy as a barn, and was a most desirable place for such a purpose. the lads who formed the company of players lived at different scattered points around, and by meeting in this spot the distances to be traversed by all the comers would be about equally proportioned.
for mummers and mumming eustacia had the greatest contempt. the mummers themselves were

dows; the front, upon which the moonbeams directly played, had originally been white; but a huge pyracanth now darkened the greater portion.
it became at once evident that the dance was proceeding immediately within the surface of the door, no apartment intervening. the brushing of skirts and elbows, sometimes the bumping of shoulders, could be heard against the very panels. eustacia, though living within two miles of the place, had never seen the interior of this quaint old habitation. between captain vye and the yeobrights there had never existed much acquaintance, the former having come as a stranger and purchased the long-empty house at mistover knap not long before the death of mrs. yeobright’s husband; and with that event and the departure of her son such friendship as had grown up became quite broken off.
“is there no passage inside the door, then?” asked eustacia as they stood within the porch.
“no,” said the lad who played the saracen. “the door opens right upon the front sit

t, since wildeve’s resumption of his right to thomasin, venn, with the thoroughness which was part of his character, had determined to see the end of the episode.
“who was there?” said mrs. yeobright.
“nobody hardly. i stood right out of the way, and she did not see me.” the reddleman spoke huskily, and looked into the garden.
“who gave her away?”
“miss vye.”
“how very remarkable! miss vye! it is to be considered an honour, i suppose?”
“who’s miss vye?” said clym.
“captain vye’s granddaughter, of mistover knap.”
“a proud girl from budmouth,” said mrs. yeobright. “one not much to my liking. people say she’s a witch, but of course that’s absurd.”
the reddleman kept to himself his acquaintance with that fair personage, and also that eustacia was there because he went to fetch her, in accordance with a promise he had given as soon as he learnt that the marriage was to take place. he merely said, in continuation of the story——
“i was sitting on the c

cond time i have been wounded today.”
“ah, yes; i have heard of it. i blush for my native egdon. was it a serious injury you received in church, miss vye?”
there was such an abundance of sympathy in clym’s tone that eustacia slowly drew up her sleeve and disclosed her round white arm. a bright red spot appeared on its smooth surface, like a ruby on parian marble.
“there it is,” she said, putting her finger against the spot.
“it was dastardly of the woman,” said clym. “will not captain vye get her punished?”
“he is gone from home on that very business. i did not know that i had such a magic reputation.”
“and you fainted?” said clym, looking at the scarlet little puncture as if he would like to kiss it and make it well.
“yes, it frightened me. i had not been to church for a long time. and now i shall not go again for ever so long—perhaps never. i cannot face their eyes after this. don’t you think it dreadfully humiliating? i wished i was dead for hours after, but i

eliminary training. my plan is one for instilling high knowledge into empty minds without first cramming them with what has to be uncrammed again before true study begins.”
“i might have believed you if you had kept yourself free from entanglements; but this woman—if she had been a good girl it would have been bad enough; but being——”
“she is a good girl.”
“so you think. a corfu bandmaster’s daughter! what has her life been? her surname even is not her true one.”
“she is captain vye’s granddaughter, and her father merely took her mother’s name. and she is a lady by instinct.”
“they call him ‘captain,’ but anybody is captain.”
“he was in the royal navy!”
“no doubt he has been to sea in some tub or other. why doesn’t he look after her? no lady would rove about the heath at all hours of the day and night as she does. but that’s not all of it. there was something queer between her and thomasin’s husband at one time—i am as sure of it as that i stand

nd. she did not know what to do. she wished it had been night instead of morning, that she might at least have borne her misery without the possibility of being seen. tracing mile after mile along between the dying ferns and the wet white spiders’ webs, she at length turned her steps towards her grandfather’s house. she found the front door closed and locked. mechanically she went round to the end where the stable was, and on looking in at the stable door she saw charley standing within.
“captain vye is not at home?” she said.
“no, ma’am,” said the lad in a flutter of feeling; “he’s gone to weatherbury, and won’t be home till night. and the servant is gone home for a holiday. so the house is locked up.”
eustacia’s face was not visible to charley as she stood at the doorway, her back being to the sky, and the stable but indifferently lighted; but the wildness of her manner arrested his attention. she turned and walked away across the enclosure to the gate, and was hidden by

do this for more than half an hour. it was not till his stock of fuel had greatly diminished that he went to the back door and sent in to beg that mrs. yeobright would open the window-shutters and see the sight outside.
eustacia, who had been sitting listlessly in the parlour, started up at the intelligence and flung open the shutters. facing her on the bank blazed the fire, which at once sent a ruddy glare into the room where she was, and overpowered the candles.
“well done, charley!” said captain vye from the chimney-corner. “but i hope it is not my wood that he’s burning.... ah, it was this time last year that i met with that man venn, bringing home thomasin yeobright—to be sure it was! well, who would have thought that girl’s troubles would have ended so well? what a snipe you were in that matter, eustacia! has your husband written to you yet?”
“no,” said eustacia, looking vaguely through the window at the fire, which just then so much engaged her mind that she did not resen

vicinity of wildeve’s residence a minute or two later. having agreed to keep watch at this hour every night, in case she should require assistance, this promptness proved how strictly he had held to his word. four hours after the present time, that is, at midnight, he was to be ready to drive her to budmouth, as prearranged.
eustacia returned to the house. supper having been got over she retired early, and sat in her bedroom waiting for the time to go by. the night being dark and threatening, captain vye had not strolled out to gossip in any cottage or to call at the inn, as was sometimes his custom on these long autumn nights; and he sat sipping grog alone downstairs. about ten o’clock there was a knock at the door. when the servant opened it the rays of the candle fell upon the form of fairway.
“i was a-forced to go to lower mistover tonight,” he said, “and mr. yeobright asked me to leave this here on my way; but, faith, i put it in the lining of my hat, and thought no more about it t

 yourself,” he said. “i’ll go and get some more wood.”
“no, no—don’t stay for that. i’ll make up the fire. will you go at once—please will you?”
yeobright ran upstairs to finish dressing himself. while he was gone another rapping came to the door. this time there was no delusion that it might be eustacia’s—the footsteps just preceding it had been heavy and slow. yeobright thinking it might possibly be fairway with a note in answer, descended again and opened the door.
“captain vye?” he said to a dripping figure.
“is my granddaughter here?” said the captain.
“no.”
“then where is she?”.
“i don’t know.”
“but you ought to know—you are her husband.”
“only in name apparently,” said clym with rising excitement. “i believe she means to elope tonight with wildeve. i am just going to look to it.”
“well, she has left my house; she left about half an hour ago. who’s sitting there?”
“my cousin thomasin.”
the captain bowed in a preoccupied w

 legs will hardly carry me there such a night as this. i am not so young as i was. if they are interrupted in their flight she will be sure to come back to me, and i ought to be at the house to receive her. but be it as ‘twill i can’t walk to the quiet woman, and that’s an end on’t. i’ll go straight home.”
“it will perhaps be best,” said clym. “thomasin, dry yourself, and be as comfortable as you can.”
with this he closed the door upon her, and left the house in company with captain vye, who parted from him outside the gate, taking the middle path, which led to mistover. clym crossed by the right-hand track towards the inn.
thomasin, being left alone, took off some of her wet garments, carried the baby upstairs to clym’s bed, and then came down to the sitting-room again, where she made a larger fire, and began drying herself. the fire soon flared up the chimney, giving the room an appearance of comfort that was doubled by contrast with the drumming of the storm without, whic

ards and forwards in the draught of the chimney till their flaccidity was changed to dry crispness throughout. then the woman came and unpinned them, and, folding them together, carried the handful upstairs. presently the doctor appeared from above with the look of a man who could do no more, and, pulling on his gloves, went out of the house, the trotting of his horse soon dying away upon the road.
at four o’clock there was a gentle knock at the door. it was from charley, who had been sent by captain vye to inquire if anything had been heard of eustacia. the girl who admitted him looked in his face as if she did not know what answer to return, and showed him in to where venn was seated, saying to the reddleman, “will you tell him, please?”
venn told. charley’s only utterance was a feeble, indistinct sound. he stood quite still; then he burst out spasmodically, “i shall see her once more?”
“i dare say you may see her,” said diggory gravely. “but hadn’t you better run and tell c
