like very sanctity, she did approach
my cabin where i lay: thrice bow'd before me;
and, gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
did this break from her: 'good antigonus,
since fate, against thy better disposition,
hath made thy person for the thrower-out
of my poor babe, according to thine oath,--
places remote enough are in bohemia,
there weep, and leave it crying; and, for the babe
is counted lost for ever, perdita
i pr'ythee call't. for this ungentle business,
put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
thy wife paulina more': so, with shrieks,
she melted into air. affrighted much,
i did in time collect myself; and thought
this was so, and no slumber. dreams are toys;
yet, for this once, yea, superstitiously,
i will be squar'd by this. i do believe
hermione hath suffer'd death, and that

that he shuts up himself; imagine me,

                        sir, the year growing ancient,--
not yet on summer's death nor on the birth
of trembling winter,--the fairest flowers o' the season
are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
our rustic garden's barren; and i care not
to get slips of them.

polixenes.
                      wherefore, gentle maiden,
do you neglect them?

perdita.
                     for i have heard it said
there is an art which, in their piedness, shares
with great creating nature.

polixenes.
                            say there be;
yet nature is made better by no mean
but nature makes that mean; so, o'er that art
which you say adds to nature, is an art
that nature makes. you see, sweet maid, we marry
a gentler scion to the wildest stock,
and make conceive a bark of baser kind
by bud of nobler race. this is an art
which does mend natu

the dibble in earth to set one slip of them;

this youth should say, 'twere well, and only therefore
desire to breed by me.--here's flowers for you;
hot lavender, mints, savory, marjoram;

                              had our prince,--
jewel of children,--seen this hour, he had pair'd
well with this lord: there was not full a month
between their births.

leontes.
pr'ythee no more; cease; thou know'st
he dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
when i shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
will bring me to consider that which may
unfurnish me of reason.--they are come.--

[re-enter cleomenes, with florizel, perdita, and attendants.]

your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
for she did print your royal father off,
conceiving you: were i but twenty-one,
your father's image is so hit in you,
his very air, that i should call you brother,
as i did him, and speak of something wildly
by us perform'd before. most dearly welcome!
and your fair princess,--goddess! o, alas!
i lost a couple that 'twixt heaven and earth
might thus have stood, begetting wonder, as
you, gracious couple, do! and then i

lord.
                      lay't so to his charge;
he's with the king your father.

leontes.
                                who? camillo?

lord.
camillo, sir; i spake with him; who now
has these poor men in question. never saw i
wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
forswear themselves as often as they speak:
bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
with divers deaths in death.

perdita.
                             o my poor father!--
the heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
our contract celebrated.

leontes.
                         you are married?

florizel.
we are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
the stars, i see, will kiss the valleys first:--
the odds for high and low's alike.

leontes.
                                   my lord,
is this the daughter of a king?

florizel.
                                she is,
when once she is my wife.

leontes.
o grave and good paulina, the great comfort
that i have had of thee!

paulina.
                         what, sovereign sir,
i did not well, i meant well. all my services
you have paid home: but that you have vouchsaf'd,
with your crown'd brother and these your contracted
heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
it is a surplus of your grace which never
my life may last to answer.

leontes.

                  as now she might have done,
so much to my good comfort, as it is
now piercing to my soul. o, thus she stood,
even with such life of majesty,--warm life,
as now it coldly stands,--when first i woo'd her!
i am asham'd: does not the stone rebuke me
for being more stone than it?--o royal piece,
there's magic in thy majesty; which has
my evils conjur'd to remembrance; and
from thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
standing like stone with thee!

perdita.
                               and give me leave;
and do not say 'tis superstition, that
i kneel, and then implore her blessing.--lady,
dear queen, that ended when i but began,
give me that hand of yours to kiss.

paulina.
                                    o, patience!
the statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's
not dry.

camillo.
my lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
so many summers dry; scarce any joy
did ever so long live; no so

                             do, paulina;
for this affliction has a taste as sweet
as any cordial comfort.--still, methinks,
there is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
could ever yet cut breath? let no man mock me,
for i will kiss her!

paulina.
                     good my lord, forbear:
the ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
you'll mar it if you kiss it; stain your own
with oily painting. shall i draw the curtain?

leontes.
no, not these twenty years.

perdita.
                            so long could i
stand by, a looker on.

paulina.
                       either forbear,
quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
for more amazement. if you can behold it,
i'll make the statue move indeed, descend,
and take you by the hand, but then you'll think,--
which i protest against,--i am assisted
by wicked powers.

leontes.
                  what you can make her do
i am content to look on: what to speak,
i am content to hear; for 'tis as eas
