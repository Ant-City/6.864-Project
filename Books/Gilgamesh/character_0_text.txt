the gilgamesh epic is the most notable literary product of babylonia as
yet discovered in the mounds of mesopotamia. it recounts the exploits
and adventures of a favorite hero, and in its final form covers twelve
tablets, each tablet consisting of six columns (three on the obverse
and three on the reverse) of about 50 lines for each column, or a total
of about 3600 lines. of this total, however, barely more than one-half
has been found among the remains of the great collection of cuneiform
tablets gat

a much older original. the absence of any reference to assyria in
the fragments recovered justifies us in assuming that the assyrian
version received its present form in babylonia, perhaps in erech;
though it is of course possible that some of the late features,
particularly the elaboration of the teachings of the theologians or
schoolmen in the eleventh and twelfth tablets, may have been produced
at least in part under assyrian influence. a definite indication
that the gilgamesh epic reverts to a period earlier than hammurabi
(or hammurawi) [3] i.e., beyond 2000 b. c., was furnished by the
publication of a text clearly belonging to the first babylonian
dynasty (of which hammurabi was the sixth member) in _ct_. vi, 5;
which text zimmern [4] recognized as a part of the tale of atra-hasis,
one of the names given to the survivor of the deluge, recounted on
the eleventh tablet of the gilgamesh epic. [5] this was confirmed
by the discovery [6] of a fragment of the del

eleventh year of ammisaduka, i.e., c. 1967 b.c. in this text, likewise,
the name of the deluge hero appears as atra-hasis (col. viii, 4). [7]
but while these two tablets do not belong to the gilgamesh epic and
merely introduce an episode which has also been incorporated into the
epic, dr. bruno meissner in 1902 published a tablet, dating, as the
writing and the internal evidence showed, from the hammurabi period,
which undoubtedly is a portion of what by way of distinction we may
call an old babylonian version. [8] it was picked up by dr. meissner
at a dealer's shop in bagdad and acquired for the berlin museum. the
tablet consists of four columns (two on the obverse and two on the

on we do not know the numeration
of the tablet in this old babylonian edition. its chief value,
apart from its furnishing a proof for the existence of the epic
as early as 2000 b. c., lies (a) in the writing _gish_ instead of
gish-gi(n)-mash in the assyrian version, for the name of the hero,
(b) in the writing en-ki-du--abbreviated from dug--"enki is
good" for en-ki-dú in the assyrian version, [9] and (c) in the
remarkable address of the maiden sabitum, dwelling at the seaside,
to whom gilgamesh comes in the course of his wanderings. from the
assyrian version we know that the hero tells the maiden of his grief
for his lost companion, and of his longing to escape the dire fate of
enkidu. in the old babylonian fragment the answer of sabitum is given
in full, and the sad note that it strikes, showing how hopeless it
is for man to try to escape death which is in store for all mankind,
is as remarkable as is the philosophy of "eat, drink and be merry"
which sabitum imparts. the addre

tended to illustrate the impossibility
of learning anything of the fate of those who have passed out of this
world. it also emphasizes the necessity of contenting oneself with the
comfort that the care of the dead, by providing burial and food and
drink offerings for them affords, as the only means of ensuring for
them rest and freedom from the pangs of hunger and distress. however,
it is of course possible that the twelfth tablet, which impresses
one as a supplement to the adventures of gilgamesh, ending with his
return to uruk (i.e., erech) at the close of the eleventh tablet, may
represent a _later_ elaboration of the tendency to connect religious
teachings with the exploits of a favorite hero.

we now have further evidence both of the extreme antiquity of the
literary form of the gilgamesh epic and also of the disposition to
make the epic the medium of illustrating aspects of life and the
destiny of mankind. the discovery by dr. arno poebel of a sumerian
form of

 the tale of the descent of ishtar to the lower world and her
release [11]--apparently a nature myth to illustrate the change of
season from summer to winter and back again to spring--enables us to
pass beyond the akkadian (or semitic) form of tales current in the
euphrates valley to the sumerian form. furthermore, we are indebted
to dr. langdon for the identification of two sumerian fragments in the
nippur collection which deal with the adventures of gilgamesh, one in
constantinople, [12] the other in the collection of the university
of pennsylvania museum. [13] the former, of which only 25 lines are
preserved (19 on the obverse and 6 on the reverse), appears to be a
description of the weapons of gilgamesh with which he arms himself
for an encounter--presumably the encounter with humbaba or huwawa,
the ruler of the cedar forest in the mountain. [14] the latter deals
with the building operations of gilgamesh in the city of erech. a

mern's _sumerische kultlieder aus altbabylonischer zeit_
(leipzig, 1913), no. 196, appears likewise to be a fragment of the
sumerian version of the gilgamesh epic, bearing on the episode of
gilgamesh's and enkidu's relations to the goddess ishtar, covered in
the sixth and seventh tablets of the assyrian version. [15]

until, however, further fragments shall have turned up, it would
be hazardous to institute a comparison between the sumerian and the
akkadian versions. all that can be said for the present is that there
is every reason to believe in the existence of a literary form of the
epic in sumerian which presumably antedated the akkadian recension,
just as we have a sumerian for

m of ishtar's descent into the nether
world, and sumerian versions of creation myths, as also of the
deluge tale. [16] it does not follow, however, that the akkadian
versions of the gilgamesh epic are translations of the sumerian,
any more than that the akkadian creation myths are translations of
a sumerian original. indeed, in the case of the creation myths,
the striking difference between the sumerian and akkadian views
of creation [17] points to the independent production of creation
stories on the part of the semitic settlers of the euphrates valley,
though no doubt these were worked out in part under sumerian literary
influences. the same is probably true of deluge tales

, which would
be given a distinctly akkadian coloring in being reproduced and
steadily elaborated by the babylonian _literati_ attached to the
temples. the presumption is, therefore, in favor of an independent
_literary_ origin for the semitic versions of the gilgamesh epic,
though naturally with a duplication of the episodes, or at least of
some of them, in the sumerian narrative. nor does the existence of a
sumerian form of the epic necessarily prove that it originated with
the sumerians in their earliest home before they came to the euphrates
valley. they may have adopted it after their conquest of southern
babylonia from the semites who, there are now substantial grounds for
believing, were the earlier settlers in the euphrates valley. [18]

t distinguish, therefore, between the earliest _literary_ form,
which was undoubtedly sumerian, and the _origin_ of the episodes
embodied in the epic, including the chief actors, gilgamesh and his
companion enkidu. it will be shown that one of the chief episodes,
the encounter of the two heroes with a powerful guardian or ruler
of a cedar forest, points to a western region, more specifically to
amurru, as the scene. the names of the two chief actors, moreover,
appear to have been "sumerianized" by an artificial process, [19]
and if this view turns out to be correct, we would have a further
ground for assuming the tale to have originated among the akkadian
settlers and to

abi period. the study of this important new
material also enables us to advance the interpretation of the epic
and to perfect the analysis into its component parts. in the spring
of 1914, the museum of the university of pennsylvania acquired by
purchase a large tablet, the writing of which as well as the style
and the manner of spelling verbal forms and substantives pointed
distinctly to the time of the first babylonian dynasty. the tablet
was identified by dr. arno poebel as part of the gilgamesh epic; and,
as the colophon showed, it formed the second tablet of the series. he
copied it with a view to publication, but the outbreak of the war which
found him in germany--his native country--prevented him from carrying
out this intention. [20] he, however, utilized some of its contents in
his discussion of the historical or semi-historical traditions about
gilgamesh, as revealed by the important list of partly mythical and
partly historical dynasties, found among the tablets of the n

ippur
collection, in which gilgamesh occurs [21] as a king of an erech
dynasty, whose father was â, a priest of kulab. [22]

the publication of the tablet was then undertaken by dr. stephen
langdon in monograph form under the title, "the epic of
gilgamish." [23] in a preliminary article on the tablet in the
_museum journal_, vol. viii, pages 29-38, dr. langdon took the
tablet to be of the late persian period (i.e., between the sixth
and third century b. c.), but his attention having been called to
this error of some _150

 a number can be restored, so that we have a fairly complete
tablet. the most serious break occurs at the top of the reverse, where
about eight lines are missing. in consequence of this the connection
between the end of the obverse (where about five lines are missing)
and the beginning of the reverse is obscured, though not to the extent
of our entirely losing the thread of the narrative.

about the same time that the university of pennsylvania museum
purchased this second tablet of the gilgamesh series, yale university
obtained a tablet from the same dealer, which turned out to be a
continuation of the university of pennsylvania tablet. that the two
belong to the same edition of the epic is shown by their agreement
in the dark brown color of the clay, in the writing as well as in
the size of the tablet, though the characters on the yale tablet
are somewhat cramped and in consequence more difficult to read. both
tablets consist of six columns, three on the obverse and three on th

natives in the mounds at warka, from which about the year 1913, many
tablets came into the hands of dealers. it is likely that where two
tablets of a series were found, others of the series were also dug up,
and we may expect to find some further portions of this old babylonian
version turning up in the hands of other dealers or in museums.

coming to the contents of the two tablets, the pennsylvania tablet
deals with the meeting of the two heroes, gilgamesh and enkidu,
their conflict, followed by their reconciliation, while the yale
tablet in continuation takes up the preparations for the encounter of
the two heroes with the guardian of the cedar forest, humbaba--but
probably pronounced hubaba [27]--or, as the name appears in the old
babylonian version, huwawa. the two tablets correspond, therefore,
to portions of tablets i to v of the assyrian version; [28] but,
as will be shown in detail further on, the number of _completely_

 in general, it may be said that the assyrian
version is more elaborate, which points to its having received its
present form at a considerably later period than the old babylonian
version. [29] on the other hand, we already find in the babylonian
version the tendency towards repetition, which is characteristic
of babylonian-assyrian tales in general. through the two babylonian
tablets we are enabled to fill out certain details of the two episodes
with which they deal: (1) the meeting of gilgamesh and enkidu, and
(2) the encounter with huwawa; while their greatest value consists
in the light that they throw on the gradual growth of the epic until
it reached its definite form in the text represented by the fragments
in ashurbanapal's library. let us now take up the detailed analysis,
first of the pennsylvania tablet and then of the yale tablet. the
pennsylvania tablet begins with two dreams recounted by gilgamesh
to his mother, which the latter interprets as presaging the coming
o

f enkidu to erech. in the one, something like a heavy meteor falls
from heaven upon gilgamesh and almost crushes him. with the help of
the heroes of erech, gilgamesh carries the heavy burden to his mother
ninsun. the burden, his mother explains, symbolizes some one who,
like gilgamesh, is born in the mountains, to whom all will pay homage
and of whom gilgamesh will become enamoured with a love as strong as
that for a woman. in a second dream, gilgamesh sees some one who is
like him, who brandishes an axe, and with whom he falls in love. this
personage, the mother explains, is again enkidu.

langdon is of the opinion that these dreams are recounted to
enkidu by a woman with whom enkidu cohabits for six days and seven
nights and who weans enkidu from association with animals. this,
however, cannot be correct. the scene between enkidu and the woman
must have been recounted in detail in the first tablet, as in the
assyrian version, [30]

whereas here in the second tablet we have the
continuation of the tale with gilgamesh recounting his dreams directly
to his mother. the story then continues with the description of the
coming of enkidu, conducted by the woman to the outskirts of erech,
where food is given him. the main feature of the incident is the
conversion of enkidu to civilized life. enkidu, who hitherto had
gone about naked, is clothed by the woman. instead of sucking milk
and drinking from a trough like an animal, food and strong drink are
placed before him, and he is taught how to eat and drink in

nd his exploit in dispatching lions is briefly told. at this
point--the end of column 3 (on the obverse), i.e., line 117, and the
beginning of column 4 (on the reverse), i.e., line 131--a gap of 13
lines--the tablet is obscure, but apparently the story of enkidu's
gradual transformation from savagery to civilized life is continued,
with stress upon his introduction to domestic ways with the wife
chosen or decreed for him, and with work as part of his fate. all
this has no connection with gilgamesh, and it is evident that the
tale of enkidu was originally an _independent_ tale to illustrate the
evolution of man's career and destiny, how through intercourse with
a woman he awakens to the sense of human dignity, how he becomes
accustomed to the ways of civilization, how he passes through the
pastoral stage to higher walks of life, how the family is instituted,
and how men come to be engaged in the labors associated with human
activities. in order to connect this tale with the gilgame

the two heroes are brought together; the woman taking on herself,
in addition to the rôle of civilizer, that of the medium through
which enkidu is brought to gilgamesh. the woman leads enkidu from
the outskirts of erech into the city itself, where the people on
seeing him remark upon his likeness to gilgamesh. he is the very
counterpart of the latter, though somewhat smaller in stature. there
follows the encounter between the two heroes in the streets of erech,
where they engage in a fierce combat. gilgamesh is overcome by enkidu
and is enraged at being thrown to the ground. the tablet closes with
the endeavor of enkidu to pacify gilgamesh. enkidu declares that the
mother of gilgamesh has exalted her son above the ordinary mortal,
and that enlil himself has singled him out for royal prerogati

after this, we may assume, the two heroes become friends and together
proceed to carry out certain exploits, the first of which is an attack
upon the mighty guardian of the cedar forest. this is the main episode
in the yale tablet, which, therefore, forms the third tablet of the
old babylonian version.

in the first column of the obverse of the yale tablet, which is badly
preserved, it would appear that the elders of erech (or perhaps the
people) are endeavoring to dissuade gilgamesh from making the attempt
to penetrate to the abode of huwawa. if this is correct, then the
close of the first column may represent a conversation between these
elders and the woman who accompanies enkidu. it would be the elders
who are represented as "reporting the speech to the woman," which is
presumably the determination of gilgamesh to fight huwawa. the elders
apparently desire enkidu to accompany gilgamesh in this perilous
adventure, and with this in view appeal to the woman. in the

second
column after an obscure reference to the mother of gilgamesh--perhaps
appealing to the sun-god--we find gilgamesh and enkidu again face to
face. from the reference to enkidu's eyes "filled with tears," we may
conclude that he is moved to pity at the thought of what will happen to
gilgamesh if he insists upon carrying out his purpose. enkidu, also,
tries to dissuade gilgamesh. this appears to be the main purport of
the dialogue between the two, which begins about the middle of the
second column and extends to the end of the third column. enkidu
pleads that even his strength is insufficient,


	"my arms are lame,
	my strength has become weak." (lines 88-89)


gilgamesh apparently asks for a description of the terrible tyrant
who thus arouses the fear of enkidu, and in reply enkidu tells
him how at one time, when he was roaming about with the cattle, he

enetrated into the forest and heard the roar of huwawa which was
like that of a deluge. the mouth of the tyrant emitted fire, and his
breath was death. it is clear, as professor haupt has suggested, [32]
that enkidu furnishes the description of a volcano in eruption, with
its mighty roar, spitting forth fire and belching out a suffocating
smoke. gilgamesh is, however, undaunted and urges enkidu to accompany
him in the adventure.

"i will go down to the forest," says gilgamesh, if the conjectural
restoration of the line in question (l. 126) is correct. enkidu replies
by again drawing a lurid picture of what will happen "when we go
(together) to the forest......." this speech of enkidu is continued on
the reverse. in reply gilgamesh emphasizes his reliance upon the good
will of shamash and reproaches enkidu with cowardice. he declares
himself superior to enkidu's warning, and in bold terms says that
he prefers to perish in the attempt to overcome huwawa rather

there follows an interesting description of the forging of the
weapons for the two heroes in preparation for the encounter. [33]
the elders of erech when they see these preparations are stricken
with fear. they learn of huwawa's threat to annihilate gilgamesh if
he dares to enter the cedar forest, and once more try to dissuade
gilgamesh from the undertaking.


	"thou art young, o gish, and thy heart carries thee away,
	thou dost not know what thou proposest to do." (lines 190-191)


they try to frighten gilgamesh by repeating the description of
the terrible huwawa. gilgamesh is still undaunted and prays to his
patron deity shamash, who apparently accords him a favorable "oracle"
(_têrtu_). the two heroes arm themselves for the fray, and

of erech, now reconciled to the perilous undertaking, counsel gilgamesh
to take provision along for the undertaking. they urge gilgamesh to
allow enkidu to take the lead, for


	"he is acquainted with the way, he has trodden the road
	[to] the entrance of the forest." (lines 252-253)


the elders dismiss gilgamesh with fervent wishes that enkidu may track
out the "closed path" for gilgamesh, and commit him to the care of
lugalbanda--here perhaps an epithet of shamash. they advise gilgamesh
to perform certain rites, to wash his feet in the stream of huwawa and
to pour out a libation of water to shamash. enkidu follows in a speech
likewise intended to encourage the hero; and with the actual beginning
of the expedition against huwawa the tablet ends. the encounter itself,
with the triumph of the two heroes, must have been described in the
fourth tablet.

ught forward for an
elamitic origin. gressmann [39] still favors such an origin, though
realizing that the description of the cedar forest points to the amanus
or lebanon range. in further confirmation of the west semitic origin of
the name, we have in lucian, _de dea syria_, § 19, the name kombabos
[40] (the guardian of stratonika), which forms a perfect parallel to
hu(m)baba. of the important bearings of this western character of the
name huwawa on the interpretation and origin of the gilgamesh epic,
suggesting that the episode of the encounter between the tyrant and
the two heroes rests upon a tradition of an expedition against the
west or amurru land, we shall have more to say further on.

the variation in the writing of the name enkidu is likewise
interesting. it is evident that the form in the old babylonian
version with the sign du (i.e., dúg) is the original, for it furnishes
us with a suitable etymology "enki is good." the writing with dúg,
pronounced du, also shows

 will be recalled that in the third column of the
yale tablet, enkidu speaks of himself in his earlier period while
still living with cattle, as wandering into the cedar forest of
huwawa, while in another passage (ll. 252-253) he is described as
"acquainted with the way ... to the entrance of the forest." this
would clearly point to the west as the original home of enkidu. we
are thus led once more to amurru--taken as a general designation of
the west--as playing an important role in the gilgamesh epic. [42] if
gilgamesh's expedition against huwawa of the lebanon district recalls
a babylonian campaign against amurru, enkidu's coming from his home,
where, as we read repeatedly in the assyrian version,


	"he ate herbs with the gazelles,
	drank out of a trough with cattle," [43]


may rest on a tradition of an amorite invasion of babylonia. the
fight between gilgamesh and enkidu would fit in with this tradition,
while the subsequent reconciliation would be the form in which the

the assyrian version. of the meaning of gish there is fortunately
no doubt. it is clearly the equivalent to the akkadian _zikaru_,
"man" (brünnow no. 5707), or possibly _rabû_, "great" (brünnow
no. 5704). among various equivalents, the preference is to be given
to _itlu_, "hero." the determinative for deity stamps the person so
designated as deified, or as in part divine, and this is in accord
with the express statement in the assyrian version of the gilgamesh
epic which describes the hero as


	"two-thirds god and one-third human." [44]


gish is, therefore, the hero-god _par excellence_; and this shows
that we are not dealing with a genuine proper name, but rather with a
descriptive attribute. proper names are not formed in this way, either
in sumerian or akkadian. now what relation does this form gish bear to

does not appear in our epic, but seems to apply to etana, another
figure of babylonian mythology), there seemed to be no further reason
to question that the problem had been solved. besides, in a later

, the probabilities are that the name is
foreign. a foreign name might naturally be spelled in various ways. the
epic in the assyrian version clearly depicts dgish-gì(n)-mash as a
conqueror of erech, who forces the people into subjection, and whose
autocratic rule leads the people of erech to implore the goddess
aruru to create a rival to him who may withstand him. in response
to this appeal denkidu is formed out of dust by aruru and eventually
brought to erech. [47] gish-gì(n)-mash or gilgamesh is therefore in
all probability a foreigner; and the simplest solution suggested by the
existence of the two forms (1) gish in the old babylonian version and
(2) gish-gì(n)-mash in the assyrian version, is to regard the former
as an abbreviation, which seemed appropriate, because the short name
conveyed the idea of the "hero" _par excellence_. if gish-gì(n)-mash
is a foreign name, one would think in the first instance of sumerian;

 my affliction," which the mother is supposed to have exclaimed
at the birth (genesis 29, 32), with a play upon _ben_ and _be'onyi_,
any more than judah means "i praise yahweh" (v. 35), though it does
contain the divine name (_ye_hô) as an element. the play on the
name may be close or remote, as long as it fulfills its function of
_suggesting_ an etymology that is complimentary or appropriate.

in this way, an artificial division and at the same time a
distortion of a foreign name like gilgamesh into several elements,
gish-bil-ga-mesh, is no more violent than, for example, the explanation
of issachar or rather issaschar as "god has given my hire" (genesis
30, 18) with a play upon the element _se_char, and as though the
name were to be divided into _yah_ ("god") and _se_char ("hire");
or the popular name of alexander among the arabs as _zu'l karnaini_,
"the possessor of the two horns." with a suggestion of his conquest
of two hemispheres, or what not. [59] the element gil in gilg

would be regarded as a contraction of gish-bil or gi-bil, in order
to furnish the meaning "father-hero," or gil might be looked upon
as a variant for gish, which would give us the "phonetic" form in
the assyrian version dgish-gi-mash, [60] as well as such a variant
writing dgish-gi-mas-(si). now a name like gilgamesh, upon which we
may definitely settle as coming closest to the genuine form, certainly
impresses one as foreign, i.e., it is neither sumerian nor akkadian;
and we have already suggested that the circumstance that the hero of
the epic is portrayed as a conqueror of erech, and a rather ruthless
one at that, points to a tradition of an invasion of the euphrates
valley as the background for the episode in the first tablet of the

en-me(n)-nun-na and bar-sal-nun-na strike one again as "sumerianized"
names rather than as genuine sumerian formations. [64]

some of these names, as galumum, arpi and etana, are so amoritic
in appearance, that one may hazard the conjecture of their western
origin. may gilgamesh likewise belong to the amurru [65] region, or
does he represent a foreigner from the east in contrast to enkidu,
whose name, we have seen, may have been baal-tôb in the west, with
which region he is according to the epic so familiar? it must be
confessed that the second element _ga-mesh_ would fit in well with
a semitic origin for the name, for the element impresses one as
the participial form of a semitic stem g-m-s, just as in the second
element of meskin-gaser we have such a form. gi

l might then be the
name of a west-semitic deity. such conjectures, however, can for the
present not be substantiated, and we must content ourselves with the
conclusion that gilgamesh as the real name of the hero, or at least
the form which comes closest to the real name, points to a foreign
origin for the hero, and that such forms as dgish-bil-ga-mesh and
dgish-bíl-gi-mesh and other variants are "sumerianized" forms for which
an artificial etymology was brought forward to convey the idea of the
"original hero" or the hero _par excellence_. by means of this "play"
on the name, which reverts to the compilers of the sumerian version
of the epic, gilgamesh was converted

 the resemblance of the two heroes to one
another extends to their personal appearance. when enkidu appears on
the streets of erech, the people are struck by this resemblance. they
remark that he is "like gish," though "shorter in stature" (lines
179-180). enkidu is described as a rival or counterpart. [66]

this relationship between the two is suggested also by the assyrian
version. in the creation of enkidu by aruru, the people urge the
goddess to create the "counterpart" (_zikru_) of gilgamesh, someone who
will be like him (_ma-si-il_) (tablet i, 2, 31). enkidu not only comes
from the mountain, [67] but the mountain is specifically designated as
his birth-place (i, 4, 2), precisely as in the pennsylvania tablet,
while in another passage he is also described, as in our tablet, as
"born in the field." [68] still more significant is the designation of
gilgamesh as the _talimu_, "younger brother," of enkidu. [69] in accord
with this, we find gilgamesh in his lament over enkidu des
 
 ___________________________
 
cribing
him as a "younger brother" (_ku-ta-ni_); [70] and again in the last
tablet of the epic, gilgamesh is referred to as the "brother" of
enkidu. [71] this close relationship reverts to the sumerian version,
for the constantinople fragment (langdon, above, p. 13) begins with the
designation of gish-bil-ga-mesh as "his brother." by "his" no doubt
enkidu is meant. likewise in the sumerian text published by zimmern
(above, p. 13) gilgamesh appears as the brother of enkidu (rev. 1, 17).

turning to the numerous representations of gilgamesh and enkidu on
seal cylinders, [72] we find this resemblance of the two heroes to each
other strikingly confirmed. both are represented as bearded, with the
strands arranged in the same fashion. the face in both cases is broad,
with curls protruding at the side of the head, though at times these
curls are lacking in the case of enkidu. what is particularly striking
is to find gilgamesh ge

ing in quite a number
of instances. [74] the hoofs and the horns mark the period when enkidu
lived with animals and much like an animal. most remarkable, however,
of all are cylinders on which we find the two heroes almost exactly
alike as, for example, ward no. 199 where two figures, the one a
duplicate of the other (except that one is just a shade taller), are in
conflict with each other. dr. ward was puzzled by this representation
and sets it down as a "fantastic" scene in which "each gilgamesh
is stabbing the other." in the light of the pennsylvania tablet,
this scene is clearly the conflict between the two heroes described
in column 6, preliminary to their forming a friendship. even in the
realm of myth the human experience holds good that there is nothing
like a good fight as a basis for a subsequent alliance. the fragment
describes this conflict as a furious one in which gilgamesh is worsted,
and his wounded pride assuaged by the generous victor, who comforts his
vanquishe

roes
in the pennsylvania tablet as alike, one the counterpart of the other,
the seal cylinder portrays them almost exactly alike, as alike as two
brothers could possibly be; with just enough distinction to make it
clear on close inspection that two figures are intended and not one
repeated for the sake of symmetry. there are slight variations in the
manner in which the hair is worn, and slightly varying expressions
of the face, just enough to make it evident that the one is intended
for gilgamesh and the other for enkidu. when, therefore, in another
specimen, no. 173, we find a gilgamesh holding his counterpart by the
legs, it is merely another aspect of the fight between the two heroes,
one of whom is intended to represent enkidu, and not, as dr. ward
supposed, a grotesque repetition of gilgamesh. [75]

the description of enkidu in the pennsylvania tablet as a parallel
figure to gilgamesh leads us to a consideration of the relationship
of the two figures to one another. many ye

ars ago it was pointed
out that the gilgamesh epic was a composite tale in which various
stories of an independent origin had been combined and brought into
more or less artificial connection with the _heros eponymos_ of
southern babylonia. [76] we may now go a step further and point out
that not only is enkidu originally an entirely independent figure,
having no connection with gish or gilgamesh, but that the latter is
really depicted in the epic as the counterpart of enkidu, a reflection
who has been given the traits of extraordinary physical power that
belong to enkidu. this is shown in the first place by the fact that
in the encounter it is enkidu who triumphs over gilgamesh. the entire
analysis of the episode of the meeting between the two heroes as given
by gressmann [77] must be revised. it is not enkidu who is terrified
and who is warned against the encounter. it is gilga

mesh who, during
the night on his way from the house in which the goddess ishhara
lies, encounters enkidu on the highway. enkidu "blocks the path"
[78] of gilgamesh. he prevents gilgamesh from re-entering the house,
[79] and the two attack each other "like oxen." [80] they grapple
with each other, and enkidu forces gilgamesh to the ground. enkidu
is, therefore, the real hero whose traits of physical prowess are
afterwards transferred to gilgamesh.

similarly in the next episode, the struggle against huwawa, the yale
tablet makes it clear that in the original form of the tale enkidu
is the real hero. all warn gish against the undertaking--the elders
of erech, enkidu, and also the workmen. "why dost thou desire to do
this?" [81] they say to him. "thou art young, and thy heart carries
thee away. thou knowest not what thou proposest to do." [82] this part
of the incident is now better known to us through the latest fragment
of the 
 
 ___________________________
 
assyrian version discovered and published by king. [83] the
elders say to gilgamesh:


	"do not trust, o gilgamesh, in thy strength!
	be warned(?) against trusting to thy attack!
	the one who goes before will save his companion, [84]
	he who has foresight will save his friend. [85]
	let enkidu go before thee.
	he knows the roads to the cedar forest;
	he is skilled in battle and has seen fight."


gilgamesh is sufficiently impressed by this warning to invite enkidu
to accompany him on a visit to his mother, ninsun, for the purpose
of receiving her counsel. [86]

it is only after enkidu, who himself hesitates and tries to dissuade
gish, decides to accompany the latter that the elders of erech
are reconciled and encourage gish for the fray. the two in concert
proceed against huwawa. gilgamesh alone cannot carry out the plan. now
when a tale thus associates two figures in one deed, one of the
 
 ___________________________
 

two has been added to the original tale. in the present case there
can be little doubt that enkidu, without whom gish cannot proceed,
who is specifically described as "acquainted with the way ... to the
entrance of the forest" [87] in which huwawa dwells is the _original_
vanquisher. naturally, the epic aims to conceal this fact as much
as possible _ad majorem gloriam_ of gilgamesh. it tries to put the
one who became the favorite hero into the foreground. therefore, in
both the babylonian and the assyrian version enkidu is represented
as hesitating, and gilgamesh as determined to go ahead. gilgamesh,
in fact, accuses enkidu of cowardice and boldly declares that he
will proceed even though failure stare him in the face. [88] traces
of the older view, however, in which gilgamesh is the one for whom
one fears the outcome, crop out; as, for example, in the complaint of

gilgamesh's mother to shamash that the latter has stirred the heart
of her son to take the distant way to hu(m)baba,


	"to a fight unknown to him, he advances,
	an expedition unknown to him he undertakes." [89]


ninsun evidently fears the consequences when her son informs her
of his intention and asks her counsel. the answer of shamash is not
preserved, but no doubt it was of a reassuring character, as was the
answer of the sun-god to gish's appeal and prayer as set forth in
the yale tablet

. [90]

again, as a further indication that enkidu is the real conqueror of
huwawa, we find the coming contest revealed to enkidu no less than
three times in dreams, which gilgamesh interprets. [91] since the
person who dreams is always the one to whom the dream applies, we may
see in these dreams a further trace of the primary rôle originally
assigned to enkidu.

another exploit which, according to the assyrian version, the two
heroes perform in concert is the killing of a bull, sent by anu at
the instance of ishtar to avenge an insult offered to the goddess
by gilgamesh, who rejects her offer of marriage. in the fragmentary
description of the contest with the b
 
 ___________________________
 
ull, we find enkidu "seizing"
the monster by "its tail." [92]

that enkidu originally played the part of the slayer is also shown
by the statement that it is he who insults ishtar by throwing a
piece of the carcass into the goddess' face, [93] adding also an
insulting speech; and this despite the fact that ishtar in her rage
accuses gilgamesh of killing the bull. [94] it is thus evident that
the epic alters the original character of the episodes in order to
find a place for gilgamesh, with the further desire to assign to the
latter the _chief_ rôle. be it noted also that enkidu, not gilgamesh,
is punished for the insult to ishtar. enkidu must therefore in the
original form of the episode have been the guilty party, who is
stricken with mortal disease as a punishment to which after twelve
days he succumbs. [95] in view of this, we may supply the name of
enkidu in the little song introduced at the close of the encounter
with the bull, and not gilgamesh as has hitherto
 
 ___________________________
 
 been done.


	"who is distinguished among the heroes?
	who is glorious among men?
	[enkidu] is distinguished among heroes,
	[enkidu] is glorious among men." [96]


finally, the killing of lions is directly ascribed to enkidu in the
pennsylvania tablet:


	"lions he attacked
	*     *     *     *     *
	lions he overcame" [97]


whereas gilgamesh appears to be afraid of lions. on his long search
for utnapishtim he says:


	"on reaching the entrance of the mountain at night
	i saw lions and was afraid." [98]


he prays to sin and ishtar to protect and save him. when, therefore,
in another passage some one celebrates gilgamesh as the one who
overcame the "guardian," who dispatched hu(m)baba in the cedar forest,
who killed lions and overthrew the bull, [99] we have the completion
of the process which transferred to gilgamesh ex
 
 ___________________________
 
ploits and powers
which originally belonged to enkidu, though ordinarily the process
stops short at making gilgamesh a _sharer_ in the exploits; with the
natural tendency, to be sure, to enlarge the share of the favorite.

we can now understand why the two heroes are described in the
pennsylvania tablet as alike, as born in the same place, aye, as
brothers. gilgamesh in the epic is merely a reflex of enkidu. the
latter is the real hero and presumably, therefore, the older
figure. [100] gilgamesh resembles enkidu, because he _is_ originally
enkidu. the "resemblance" _motif_ is merely the manner in which
in the course of the partly popular, partly literary transfer, the
recollection is preserved that enkidu is the original, and gilgamesh
the copy.

the artificiality of the process which brings the two heroes together
is apparent in the dreams of gilgamesh which are interpreted by
his mother as portending the coming of enkidu. not the conflict is
foreseen, but the subsequent clos

e association, naïvely described as
due to the personal charm which enkidu exercises, which will lead
gilgamesh to fall in love with the one whom he is to meet. the two
will become one, like man and wife.

on the basis of our investigations, we are now in a position to
reconstruct in part the cycle of episodes that once formed part of
an enkidu epic. the fight between enkidu and gilgamesh, in which
the former is the victor, is typical of the kind of tales told of
enkidu. he is the real prototype of the greek hercules. he slays
lions, he overcomes a powerful opponent dwelling in the forests of
lebanon, he kills the bull, and he finally succumbs to disease sent
as a punishment by an angry goddess. the death of enkidu naturally
formed the close of the enkidu epic, which in its original form may,
of course, have included other exploits besides those taken over into
the gilga

mesh epic.



vii.


there is another aspect of the figure of enkidu which is brought
forward in the pennsylvania tablet more clearly than had hitherto been
the case. many years ago attention was called to certain striking
resemblances between enkidu and the figure of the first man as
described in the early chapters of genesis. [101] at that time we had
merely the assyrian version of the gilgamesh epic at our disposal,
and the main point of contact was the description of enkidu living
with the animals, drinking and feeding like an animal, until a woman
is brought to him with whom he engages in sexual intercourse. this
suggested that enkidu was a picture of primeval man, while the
woman reminded one of eve, who when she is brought to adam becomes
his helpmate and inseparable companion. the biblical tale stands,
of course, on a much higher level, and is introduced, as are other
tra
 
 ___________________________
 


we may now pass beyond these general indications and recognize in the
story of enkidu as revealed by the pennsylvania tablet an attempt
to trace the evolution of primitive man from low beginnings to the
regular and orderly family life associated with advanced culture. the
new tablet furnishes a further illustration for the surprisingly early
tendency among the babylonian _literati_ to connect with popular tales
teachings of a religious or ethical character. just as the episode
between gilgamesh and the maiden sabitum is made the occasion for
introducing reflections on the inevitable fate of man to encounter
death, so the meeting of enkidu with the woman becomes the medium
of impressing the lesson of human progress through the substitution
of bread and wine for milk and water, through the institution of
the family, and through work and the laying up of resources. this
is the significance of the address to enkidu in column 4 of the
pennsylvania tablet, even though certain express

ions in it are
somewhat obscure. the connection of the entire episode of enkidu and
the woman with gilgamesh is very artificial; and it becomes much more
intelligible if we disassociate it from its present entanglement in
the epic. in gilgamesh's dream, portending the meeting with enkidu,
nothing is said of the woman who is the companion of the latter. the
passage in which enkidu is created by aruru to oppose gilgamesh [102]
betrays evidence of having been worked over in order to bring enkidu
into association with the longing of the people of erech to get rid
of a tyrannical character. the people in their distress appeal to
aruru to create a rival to gilgamesh. in response,


	"aruru upon hearing this created a man of anu in her heart."


now this "man of anu" cannot possibly be enkidu, for the sufficient
reason that a few lines further on enkidu is described as an offspring
of ninib. moreover, th
 
 ___________________________
 
e being created is not a "counterpart"
of gilgamesh, but an animal-man, as the description that follows
shows. we must separate lines 30-33 in which the creation of the "anu
man" is described from lines 34-41 in which the creation of enkidu is
narrated. indeed, these lines strike one as the proper _beginning_
of the original enkidu story, which would naturally start out with
his birth and end with his death. the description is clearly an
account of the creation of the first man, in which capacity enkidu
is brought forward.


	"aruru wa

shed her hands, broke off clay,
	threw it on the field [103]
	... created enkidu, the hero, a lofty
	offspring of the host of ninib." [104]


the description of enkidu follows, with his body covered with hair
like an animal, and eating and drinking with the animals. there
follows an episode [105] which has no connection whatsoever with
the gilgamesh epic, but which is clearly intended to illustrate how
enkidu came to abandon the life with the animals. a hunter sees enkidu
and is amazed at the strange sight--an animal and yet a man. enkidu,
as though resenting his condition, becomes enraged at the sight of
the hunter, and the latter goes to his father and tells him of the
strange creature whom he is unable to catch. in reply, the father
advises his son to take a woman with him when next he goes out on
his pursuit, and to have the wom

an remove her dress in the presence
of enkidu, who will then approach her, and after intercourse with
her will abandon the animals among whom he lives. by this device he
will catch the strange creature. lines 14-18 of column 3 in the first
tablet in which the father of the hunter refers to gilgamesh must be
regarded as a later insertion, a part of the reconstruction of the
tale to connect the episode with gilgamesh. the advice of the father
to his son, the hunter, begins, line 19,


	"go my hunter, take with thee a woman."


in the reconstructed tale, the father tells his son to go to gilgamesh
to relate to him the strange appearance of the animal-man; but there
is clearly no purpose in this, as is shown by the fact that when the
hunter does so, gilgamesh makes _precisely the same speech_ as does
the father of the hunter. lines 40-44 of column 3, in which gilgamesh
is represented as speaking t

o the hunter form a complete _doublet_
to lines 19-24, beginning


	"go, my hunter, take with thee a woman, etc."


and similarly the description of enkidu appears twice, lines 2-12
in an address of the hunter to his father, and lines 29-39 in the
address of the hunter to gilgamesh.

the artificiality of the process of introducing gilgamesh into
the episode is revealed by this awkward and entirely meaningless
repetition. we may therefore reconstruct the first two scenes in the
enkidu epic as follows: [106]

tablet i, col. 2, 34-35: creation of enkidu by aruru.

36-41: description of enkidu's hairy body and of his life with the
animals.

42-50: the hunter sees enkidu, who shows his anger, as also his woe,
at his condition.

3, 1-12: the hunter tells his father of the strange being who pulls
up the traps which the hunt

by her and stays with her six days and seven nights. the animals see
the change in enkidu and run away from him. he has been transformed
through the woman. so far the episode. in the assyrian version there
follows an address of the woman to enkidu beginning (col. 4, 34):


	"beautiful art thou, enkidu, like a god art thou."


we find her urging him to go with her to erech, there to meet gilgamesh
and to enjoy the pleasures of city life with plenty of beautiful
maidens. gilgamesh, she adds, will expect enkidu, for the coming
of the latter to erech has been foretold in a dream. it is evident
that here we have again the later transformation of the enkidu epic
in order to bring the two heroes together. will it be considered too
bold if we assume that in the original form the address of the woman
and the construction of the episode were such as we find preserved in
part in columns 2 
 
 ___________________________
 
epic? the address
of the woman begins in line 51 of the pennsylvania tablet:


	"i gaze upon thee, enkidu, like a god art thou."


this corresponds to the line in the assyrian version (i, 4, 34)
as given above, just as lines 52-53:


	"why with the cattle
	dost thou roam across the field?"


correspond to i, 4, 35, of the assyrian version. there follows in both
the old babylonian and the assyrian version the appeal of the woman
to enkidu, to allow her to lead him to erech where gilgamesh dwells
(pennsylvania tablet lines 54-61 = assyrian version i, 4, 36-39);
but in the pennsylvania tablet we now have a _second_ speech (lines
62-63) beginning like the first one with _al-ka_, "come:"


	"come, arise from the accursed ground."


enkidu consents, and now the woman takes off her garments and clothes
the naked enkidu, while putting another garment on herself. she takes
hold of his hand and leads him to the sheepfolds (not to erech!!),
where bread and wine are placed befo

re him. accustomed hitherto
to sucking milk with cattle, enkidu does not know what to do with
the strange food until encouraged and instructed by the woman. the
entire third column is taken up with this introduction of enkidu
to civilized life in a pastoral community, and the scene ends with
enkidu becoming a guardian of flocks. now all this has nothing to
do with gilgamesh, and clearly sets forth an entirely different
idea from the one embodied in the meeting of the two heroes. in the
original enkidu tale, the animal-man is looked upon as the type of a
primitive savage, and the point of the tale is to illustrate in the
naïve manner characteristic of folklore the evolution to the higher
form of pastoral life. this aspect of the incident is, therefore,
to be separated from the other phase which has as its chief _motif_
the bringing of the two heroes togethe

sen independently, hebrew and babylonian
writers diverged, each group going its own way, each reflecting the
particular point of view from which the evolution of human society
was viewed.

leaving the analogy between the biblical and babylonian tales aside,
the main point of value for us in the babylonian story of enkidu
and the woman is the proof furnished by the analysis, made possible
through the pennsylvania tablet, that the tale can be separated
from its subsequent connection with gilgamesh. we can continue this
process of separation in the fourth column, where the woman instructs
enkidu in the further duty of living his life with the woman decreed
for him, to raise a family, to engage in work, to build cities and
to gather resources. all this is looked upon in the same optimistic
spirit as marking progress, whereas the biblical writer, consistent
with his point of view, looks upon work as a curse, and makes cain,
the murderer, also the founder of cities. the step to the hi

 shame and uncovers himself
(genesis 9, 21), whereas in the babylonian description enkidu's jolly
spirit after he has drunk seven jars of wine meets with approval. the
biblical point of view is that he who drinks wine becomes drunk;
[109] the babylonian says, if you drink wine you become happy. [110]

if the thesis here set forth of the original character and import
of the episode of enkidu with the woman is correct, we may again
regard lines 149-153 of the pennsylvania tablet, in which gilgamesh
is introduced, as a later addition to bring the two heroes into
association. the episode in its original form ended with the
introduction of enkidu first to pastoral life, and then to the still
higher city life with regulated forms of social existence.

now, to be sure, this enkidu has little in common with the enkidu
who is described as a powerful warrior, a hercules, who kills lions,
overcomes the giant huwawa, and dispatches a great bull, but it is
the nature of folklore everywhere

an,
told how he emerged from this state, how he became civilized, was
clothed, learned to eat food and drink wine, how he shaved off the
hair with which his body was covered, [112] anointed himself--in short,


	"he became manlike." [113]


thereupon he is taught his duties as a husband, is introduced to
the work of building, and to laying aside supplies, and the like. the
fully-developed and full-fledged hero then engages in various exploits,
of which _some_ are now embodied in the gilgamesh epic. who this enkidu
was, we are not in a position to determine, but the suggestion has
been thrown out above that he is a personage foreign to babylonia,
that his home appears to be in the undefined amurru district, and
that he conquers that district. the original tale of enkidu, if this
view be correct, must therefore have been carried to the euphrates
valley, at a very remote period, with one of the migratory waves that
brought a western people as invaders into babylonia. here the ta

was combined with stories current of another hero, gilgamesh--perhaps
also of western origin--whose conquest of erech likewise represents
an invasion of babylonia. the center of the gilgamesh tale was erech,
and in the process of combining the stories of enkidu and gilgamesh,
enkidu is brought to erech and the two perform exploits in common. in
such a combination, the aim would be to utilize all the incidents of
_both_ tales. the woman who accompanies enkidu, therefore, becomes
the medium of bringing the two heroes together. the story of the
evolution of primitive man to civilized life is transformed into the
tale of enkidu's removal to erech, and elaborated with all kinds of
details, among which we have, as perhaps embodying a genuine historical
tradition,
 
 ___________________________
 
 the encounter of the two heroes.

before passing on, we have merely to note the very large part taken
in both the old babylonian and the assyrian version by the struggle
against huwawa. the entire yale tablet--forming, as we have seen,
the third of the series--is taken up with the preparation for the
struggle, and with the repeated warnings given to gilgamesh against
the dangerous undertaking. the fourth tablet must have recounted the
struggle itself, and it is not improbable that this episode extended
into the fifth tablet, since in the assyrian version this is the
case. the elaboration of the story is in itself an argument in favor
of assuming some historical background for it--the recollection of
the conquest of amurru by some powerful warrior; and we have seen
that this conquest must be ascribed to enkidu and not to gilgamesh.

if, now, enkidu is not only the older figure but the one who is the
real hero of the most notable episode in the gilgamesh epic; if,
furthermore, enkidu is the hercules who kills lions and dispatches
the bull sent by an enraged goddess, what becomes of gilgamesh? what
is left for him?

in the first place, he is definitely the conqueror of erech. he builds
the wall of erech, [114] and we may assume that the designation of
the city as _uruk supûri_, "the walled erech," [115] rests upon this
tradition. he is also associated with the great temple eanna, "the
heavenly house," in erech. to gilgamesh belongs also the unenviable
tradition of having exercised his rule in erech so harshly that the
people are impelled to implore aruru to create a rival

v inclusive of the assyrian version being taken up with the huwawa
episode, modified with a view of bringing the two heroes together,
we come at once to the sixth tablet, which tells the story of how
the goddess ishtar wooed gilgamesh, and of the latter's rejection
of her advances. this tale is distinctly a nature myth. the attempt
of gressmann [116] to find some historical background to the episode
is a failure. the goddess ishtar symbolizes the earth which woos the
sun in the spring, but whose love is fatal, for after a few months
the sun's power begins to wane. gilgamesh, who in incantation hymns
is invoked in terms which show that he was conceived as a sun-god,
[117] recalls to the goddess how she changed her love

like circe of greek mythology, and brought them to grief. enraged at
gilgamesh's insult to her vanity, she flies to her father anu and cries
for revenge. at this point the episode of the creation of the bull is
introduced, but if the analysis above given is correct it is enkidu
who is the hero in dispatching the bull, and we must assume that the
sickness with which gilgamesh is smitten is the punishment sent by anu
to avenge the insult to his daughter. this sickness symbolizes the
waning strength of the sun after midsummer is past. the sun recedes
from the earth, and this was pictured in the myth as the sun-god's
rejection of ishtar; gilgamesh's fear of death marks the approach
of the winter season, when the sun appears to have lost its vigor
completely and is near to death. the entire episode is, therefore,
a nature myth, symbolical of the passing of spring

 to midsummer and
then to the bare season. the myth has been attached to gilgamesh as
a favorite figure, and then woven into a pattern with the episode
of enkidu and the bull. the bull episode can be detached from the
nature myth without any loss to the symbolism of the tale of ishtar
and gilgamesh.

as already suggested, with enkidu's death after this conquest
of the bull the original enkidu epic came to an end. in order to
connect gilgamesh with enkidu, the former is represented as sharing
in the struggle against the bull. enkidu is punished with death,
while gilgamesh is smitten with disease. since both shared equally
in the guilt, the punishment should have been the same for both. the
differentiation may be taken as an indication that gilgamesh's disease
has nothing to do with the bull episode, but is merely part of the
nature myth.

gilgamesh now begins a series of wanderings in search of
the restoration of his vigor,

and this _motif_ is evidently a
continuation of the nature myth to symbolize the sun's wanderings
during the dark winter in the hope of renewed vigor with the coming
of the spring. professor haupt's view is that the disease from which
gilgamesh is supposed to be suffering is of a venereal character,
affecting the organs of reproduction. this would confirm the position
here taken that the myth symbolizes the loss of the sun's vigor. the
sun's rays are no longer strong enough to fertilize the earth. in
accord with this, gilgamesh's search for healing leads him to the
dark regions [118] in which the scorpion-men dwell. the terrors of
the region symbolize the gloom of the winter season. at last gilgamesh
reaches a region of light a

gain, described as a landscape situated at
the sea. the maiden in control of this region bolts the gate against
gilgamesh's approach, but the latter forces his entrance. it is the
picture of the sun-god bursting through the darkness, to emerge as
the youthful reinvigorated sun-god of the spring.

now with the tendency to attach to popular tales and nature myths
lessons illustrative of current beliefs and aspirations, gilgamesh's
search for renewal of life is viewed as man's longing for eternal
life. the sun-god's waning power after midsummer is past suggests
man's growing weakness after the meridian of life has been left
behind. winter is death, and man longs to escape it. gilgamesh's
wanderings are used as illustration of this longing, and accordingly
the search for life becomes also the quest for immortality. can the
precious boon of eternal life be achieved? popular fancy created
the figure of a favorite o

f the gods who had escaped a destructive
deluge in which all mankind had perished. [119] gilgamesh hears of
this favorite and determines to seek him out and learn from him the
secret of eternal life. the deluge story, again a pure nature myth,
symbolical of the rainy season which destroys all life in nature,
is thus attached to the epic. gilgamesh after many adventures finds
himself in the presence of the survivor of the deluge who, although
human, enjoys immortal life among the gods. he asks the survivor
how he came to escape the common fate of mankind, and in reply
utnapishtim tells the story of the catastrophe that brought about
universal destruction. the moral of the tale is obvious. only those
singled out by the special favor of the gods can hope to be removed
to the distant "source of the streams" and live forever. the rest

of
mankind must face death as the end of life.

that the story of the deluge is told in the eleventh tablet of the
series, corresponding to the eleventh month, known as the month of
"rain curse" [120] and marking the height of the rainy season, may
be intentional, just as it may not be accidental that gilgamesh's
rejection of ishtar is recounted in the sixth tablet, corresponding to
the sixth month, [121] which marks the end of the summer season. the
two tales may have formed part of a cycle of myths, distributed
among the months of the year. the gilgamesh epic, however, does
not form such a cycle. both myths have been artificially attached
to the adventures of the hero. for the deluge story we now have the
definite proof for its independent existence, through dr. poebel's
publication of a sum

erian text which embodies the tale, [122] and
without any reference to gilgamesh. similarly, scheil and hilprecht
have published fragments of deluge stories written in akkadian and
likewise without any connection with the gilgamesh epic. [123]

in the epic the story leads to another episode attached to gilgamesh,
namely, the search for a magic plant growing in deep water, which has
the power of restoring old age to youth. utnapishtim, the survivor of
the deluge, is moved through pity for gilgamesh, worn out by his long
wanderings. at the request of his wife, utnapishtim decides to tell
gilgamesh of this plant, and he succeeds in finding it. he plucks it
and decides to take it back to erech so that all may enjoy the benefit,
but on his way stops to bathe in a cool cistern. a serpent comes along

and snatches the plant from him, and he is forced to return to erech
with his purpose unachieved. man cannot hope, when old age comes on,
to escape death as the end of everything.

lastly, the twelfth tablet of the assyrian version of the gilgamesh
epic is of a purely didactic character, bearing evidence of having
been added as a further illustration of the current belief that there
is no escape from the nether world to which all must go after life has
come to an end. proper burial and suitable care of the dead represent
all that can be done in order to secure a fairly comfortable rest for
those who have passed out of this world. enkidu is once more introduced
into this episode. his shade is invoked by gilgamesh and rises up out
o

	"tell me, my friend, tell me, my friend,
	the law of the earth which thou hast
	experienced, tell me,"


the mournful message comes back:


	"i cannot tell thee, my friend, i cannot tell."


death is a mystery and must always remain such. the historical
gilgamesh has clearly no connection with the figure introduced into
this twelfth tablet. indeed, as already suggested, the gilgamesh epic
must have ended with the return to erech, as related at the close of
the eleventh tablet. the twelfth tablet was added by some school-men of
babylonia (or perhaps of assyria), purely for the purpose of conveying
a summary of the teachings in regard to the fate of the dead. whether
these six episodes covering the sixth to the twelfth tablets, (1) the
nature myth, (2) the killing of the divine bull, (3) the punishment
of gilgamesh and the death of enkidu, (4) gilgamesh's wanderings,

 
 ___________________________
 
(5) the deluge, (6) the search for immortality, were all included
at the time that the old babylonian version was compiled cannot, of
course, be determined until we have that version in a more complete
form. since the two tablets thus far recovered show that as early as
2000 b.c. the enkidu tale had already been amalgamated with the current
stories about gilgamesh, and the endeavor made to transfer the traits
of the former to the latter, it is eminently likely that the story of
ishtar's unhappy love adventure with gilgamesh was included, as well
as gilgamesh's punishment and the death of enkidu. with the evidence
furnished by meissner's fragment of a version of the old babylonian
revision and by our two tablets, of the early disposition to make
popular tales the medium of illustrating current beliefs and the
teachings of the temple schools, it may
 
 ___________________________
 
 furthermore be concluded that
the death of enkidu and the punishment of gilgamesh were utilized for
didactic purposes in the old babylonian version. on the other hand,
the proof for the existence of the deluge story in the hammurabi
period and some centuries later, _independent_ of any connection
with the gilgamesh epic, raises the question whether in the old
babylonian version, of which our two tablets form a part, the deluge
tale was already woven into the pattern of the epic. at all events,
till proof to the contrary is forthcoming, we may assume that the
twelfth tablet of the assyrian version, though also reverting to a
babylonian original, dates as the _latest_ addition to the epic from
a period subsequent to 2000 b.c.; and that the same is probably the
case with the eleventh tablet.

to sum up, there are four main currents that flow together in the
gilgamesh epic even in its old babylonian form: (1) the adventures of
a mighty warrior enkidu, resting perhaps on a faint tradition of the
conquest of amurru by the hero; (2) the more definite recollection
of the exploits of a foreign invader of babylonia by the name of
gilgamesh, whose home appears likewise to have been in the west; [124]
(3) nature myths and didactic tales transferred to enkidu and gilgamesh
as popular figures; and (4) the process of weaving the traditions,
exploits, myths and didactic tales together, in the course of which
process gilgamesh becomes the main hero, and enkidu his companion.

furthermore, our investigation has shown that to enkidu belongs the
episode with the woman, used to illustrate the evolution of primitive
man to the ways and conditions of civilized life, the conquest of
huwawa in the land of amurru, the killing of lions and also of the
bull, while gilg
 
 ___________________________
 
amesh is the hero who conquers erech. identified with
the sun-god, the nature myth of the union of the sun with the earth and
the subsequent separation of the two is also transferred to him. the
wanderings of the hero, smitten with disease, are a continuation of
the nature myth, symbolizing the waning vigor of the sun with the
approach of the wintry season.

the details of the process which led to making gilgamesh the favorite
figure, to whom the traits and exploits of enkidu and of the sun-god
are transferred, escape us, but of the fact that enkidu is the _older_
figure, of whom certain adventures were set forth in a tale that
once had an independent existence, there can now be little doubt in
the face of the evidence furnished by the two tablets of the old
babylonian version; just as the study of these tablets shows that
in the combination of the tales of enkidu and gilgamesh, the former
is the
 
 ___________________________
 
 prototype of which gilgamesh is the copy. if the two are
regarded as brothers, as born in the same place, even resembling one
another in appearance and carrying out their adventures in common,
it is because in the process of combination gilgamesh becomes the
_reflex_ of enkidu. that enkidu is not the figure created by aruru to
relieve erech of its tyrannical ruler is also shown by the fact that
gilgamesh remains in control of erech. it is to erech that he returns
when he fails of his purpose to learn the secret of escape from old
age and death. erech is, therefore, not relieved of the presence of
the ruthless ruler through enkidu. the "man of anu" formed by aruru
as a deliverer is confused in the course of the growth of the epic
with enkidu, the offspring of ninib, and in this way we obtain the
strange contradiction of enkidu and gilgamesh appearing first as bitter
rivals and then as clo

se and inseparable friends. it is of the nature
of epic compositions everywhere to eliminate unnecessary figures by
concentrating on one favorite the traits belonging to another or to
several others.

the close association of enkidu and gilgamesh which becomes one of
the striking features in the combination of the tales of these two
heroes naturally recalls the "heavenly twins" _motif_, which has been
so fully and so suggestively treated by professor j. rendell harris
in his _cult of the heavenly twins_, (london, 1906). professor harris
has conclusively shown how widespread the tendency is to associate
two divine or semi-divine beings in myths and legends as inseparable
companions [125] or twins, like castor and pollux, romulus a

riac acts of thomas), and the various illustrations of "dioscuri
in christian legends," set forth by dr. harris in his work under this
title, which carries the _motif_ far down into the period of legends
about christian saints who appear in pairs, including the reference
to such a pair in shakespeare's henry v:


	"and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by
	from that day to the ending of the world."--(_act, iv,
	3, 57-58._)


there are indeed certain parallels which suggest that enkidu-gilgamesh
may represent a babylonian counterpart to the "heavenly twins." in
the indo-iranian, greek and roman mythology, the twins almost
invariably act together. in unison they proceed on expeditions to
punish enemies. [129]

but after all, the parallels are of too general a character to be of
much moment; and moreover the parallels stop short at the critical
point, for gilgamesh though worsted is _not_ killed by enkidu,
whereas one of the "heavenly twins" is always killed by the brother,
as

abel is by cain, and iphikles by his twin brother herakles. even
the trait which is frequent in the earliest forms of the "heavenly
twins," according to which one is immortal and the other is mortal,
though applying in a measure to enkidu who is killed by ishtar, while
gilgamesh the offspring of a divine pair is only smitten with disease,
is too unsubstantial to warrant more than a general comparison between
the enkidu-gilgamesh pair and the various forms of the "twin" _motif_
found throughout the ancient world. for all that, the point is of some
interest that in the gilgamesh epic we should encounter two figures who
are portrayed as possessing the same traits and accomplishing feats in
common, which suggest a partial parallel to the various forms in which
the twin-_motif_ appears in the mythologies, folk-lore and legends
of many nations; and it may be that in some of these instances the
duplication is due, as i

in concluding this study of the two recently discovered tablets of
the old babylonian version of the gilgamesh epic which has brought us
several steps further in the interpretation and in our understanding
of the method of composition of the most notable literary production
of ancient babylonia, it will be proper to consider the _literary_
relationship of the old babylonian to the assyrian version.

we have already referred to the different form in which the names
of the chief figures appear in the old babylonian version, dgish as
against dgish-gì(n)-mash, den-ki-du as against den-ki-dú, hu-wa

ion for the assyrian revision; and
this conclusion is confirmed by a comparison of parallel passages in
our two tablets with the assyrian version, for such parallels rarely
extend to verbal agreements in details, and, moreover, show that the
assyrian version has been elaborated.

beginning with the pennsylvania tablet, column i is covered in the
assyrian version by tablet i, 5, 25, to 6, 33, though, as pointed out
above, in the assyrian version we have the anticipation of the dreams
of gilgamesh and their interpretation through their recital to enkidu
by his female companion, whereas in the old babylonian version we
have the dreams _directly_ given in a conversation between gilgamesh
and his mother. in the anticipation, there would naturally be some
omissions. so lines 4-5 and 12-13 of the pennsylvania tablet do not
appear in the assyrian version, but in their place is a line (i, 5,
35), to be restored to


	"[i saw him and like] a woman i fell in love with him."


which oc

curs in the old babylonian version only in connection with
the second dream. the point is of importance as showing that in the
babylonian version the first dream lays stress upon the omen of
the falling meteor, as symbolizing the coming of enkidu, whereas
the second dream more specifically reveals enkidu as a man, [131]
of whom gilgamesh is instantly enamored. strikingly variant lines,
though conveying the same idea, are frequent. thus line 14 of the
babylonian version reads


	"i bore it and carried it to thee"


and appears in the assyrian version (i, 5, 35_b_ supplied from 6, 26)


	"i threw it (or him) at thy feet" [132]


with an additional line in elaboration


	"thou didst bring him into contact with me" [133]


which anticipates the speech of the mother

-25, an elaboration of line
30 in the pennsylvania tablet and taken over from the recital of
the first dream. through the assyrian version i, 6, 31-32, we can
restore the closing lines of column i of the pennsylvania tablet,
while with line 33 = line 45 of the pennsylvania tablet, the parallel
between the two versions comes to an end. lines 34-43 of the assyrian
version (bringing tablet i to a close) [135] represent an elaboration
of the speech of ninsun, followed by a further address of gilgamesh
to his mother, and by the determination of gilgamesh to seek out
enkidu. [136] nothing of this sort appears to have been included in
the old babylonian version.our text proceeds with the scene between
enkidu and the woman, in which the latter by her charms and her appeal
endeavors to lead enkidu away from his life with the animals. from
the abrupt manner in which the scene is introduced in line 43 of the
pennsylvania tablet, it is evident that this cannot be the _first_
mention of the w

oman. the meeting must have been recounted in the
first tablet, as is the case in the assyrian version. [137] the second
tablet takes up the direct recital of the dreams of gilgamesh and
then continues the narrative. whether in the old babylonian version
the scene between enkidu and the woman was described with the same
naïve details, as in the assyrian version, of the sexual intercourse
between the two for six days and seven nights cannot of course be
determined, though presumably the assyrian version, with the tendency
of epics to become more elaborate as they pass from age to age, added
some realistic touches. assuming that lines 44-63 of the pennsylvania

leave the "accursed ground" in which he dwells. this speech, as the
description which follows, extending into columns 3-4, and telling how
the woman clothed enkidu, how she brought him to the sheep folds, how
she taught him to eat bread and to drink wine, and how she instructed
him in the ways of civilization, must have been included in the second
tablet of the assyrian version which has come down to us in a very
imperfect form. nor is the scene in which enkidu and gilgamesh have
their encounter found in the preserved portions of the second (or
possibly the third) tablet of the assyrian version, but only a brief
reference to it in the fourth tablet, [138] in which in epic style the
story is repeated, leading up to the second exploit--the joint campaign
of enkidu and gilgamesh against huwawa. this reference, covering only
seven lines, corresponds to lines 192-231 of the pennsylvania tablet;

growth would take in more than its original confines. "erech of the
plazas" must have come to be used as a honorific designation of this
important center as early as 2000 b. c., whereas later, perhaps
because of its decline, the epithet no longer seemed appropriate
and was replaced by the more modest designation of "walled erech,"
with an allusion to the tradition which ascribed the building of the
wall of the city to gilgamesh. at all events, all three expressions,
"erech of the plazas," "erech walled" and "erech land," are to be
regarded as synonymous. the position once held by erech follows also
from its ideographic designation (brünnow no. 4796) by the sign "house"
with a "gunufied" extension, which conveys the idea of unu = _subtu_,
or "dwelling" _par excellence_. the pronunciation unug or unuk (see
the gloss _u-nu-uk_, vr 23, 8a), composed of _unu_, "dwelling," and
_ki_, "place," is hardly to be regarded

the break at the close of column 3 (about 5 lines) and the top
of column 4 (about 8 lines) is a most serious interruption in the
narrative, and makes it difficult to pick up the thread where the
tablet again becomes readable. we cannot be certain whether the "strong
man, the unique hero" who addresses some one (lines 115-117) is enkidu
or gish or some other personage, but presumably gish is meant. in the
assyrian version, tablet i, 3, 2 and 29, we find gilgamesh described
as the "unique hero" and in l. 234 of the pennsylvania tablet gish
is called "unique," while again, in the assyrian version, tablet i,
2, 15 and 26, he is designated as _gasru_ as in our text. assuming
this, whom does he address? perhaps the shepherds? in either case
he receives an answer that rejoices him. if the fragment of the
assyrian version (k 8574) above discussed is the equivalent to the
close of column 3 of the pennsylvania tablet, we may go one step

plural forms. our text furnishes, as does also the yale tablet, an
interesting illustration of the vacillation in the hammurabi period
in the twofold use of _im_: (a) as an indication of the plural (as in

that enkidu comforts his rival by telling him that he is destined for
a career above that of the ordinary man. he is to be more than a mere

version, tablet iv, 5, 2 and 5), _i-sim-sú d_enlil = yale tablet,
l. 137, where this is to be supplied. this position accorded to enlil
is an important index for the origin of the epic, which is thus shown
to date from a period when the patron deity of nippur was acknowledged
as the general head of the pantheon. this justifies us in going back
several centuries at least before hammurabi for the beginning of
the gilgamesh story. if it had originated in the hammurabi period,
we should have had marduk introduced instead of enlil.

[note on sabitum (above, p. 11)

in a communication before the oriental club of philadelphia (feb. 10,
1920), prof. haupt made the suggestion that _sa-bi-tum_ (or _tu_),
hitherto regarded as a proper name, is an epithet describing the
woman who dwells at the seashore which gilgamesh in the course of his
wanderings reaches, as an "innkeeper". it is noticeable that the term
always appears without the determinative placed before proper names;
and since in the old babylonian version (so far as preserved) and
in the assyrian version, the determinative is invariably used, its
consistent absence in the case of _sabitum_ (assyrian version, tablet
x, 1, 1, 10, 15, 20; 2, 15-16 [_sa-bit_]; meissner fragment col. 2,
11-12) speaks in favor of professor haupt's suggestion. the m

k" and in the pael to "furnish drink". muss-arnolt
in his assyrian dictionary, 746b, has also recognized that _sabitum_
was originally an epithet and compares the aramaic _se_bhoyâthâ(p1)
"barmaids". in view of the bad reputation of inns in ancient babylonia
as brothels, it would be natural for an epithet like _sabitum_ to
become the equivalent to "public" women, just as the inn was a "public"
house. sabitum would, therefore, have the same force as _samhatu_
(the "harlot"), used in the gilgamesh epic by the side of _harimtu_
"woman" (see the note to line 46 of pennsylvania tablet). the sumerian
term for the female innkeeper is sal gestinna "the woman of the wine,"
known to us from the hammurabi code §§108-111. the bad reputation of
inns is confirmed by these statutes, for the house of the sal gestinna
is a gathering place for outlaws. the punishment of a female devotee
who enters the "house of a wine woman" (bît sal gestinna §110) is
death. it was not "prohibition" that prom

pted so severe a punishment,
but the recognition of the purpose for which a devotee would enter
such a house of ill repute. the speech of the _sabitum_ or innkeeper
to gilgamesh (above, p. 12) was, therefore, an invitation to stay with
her, instead of seeking for life elsewhere. viewed as coming from a
"public woman" the address becomes significant. the invitation would
be parallel to the temptation offered by the _harimtu_ in the first
tablet of the enkidu, and to which enkidu succumbs. the incident
in the tablet would, therefore, form a parallel in the adventures
of gilgamesh to the one that originally belonged to the enkidu
cycle. finally, it is quite possibl

mrod epic" on the supposition that the hero of
the babylonian epic is identical with nimrod, the "mighty hunter"
of genesis 10, has now been generally abandoned, in the absence of
any evidence that the babylonian hero bore a name like nimrod. for
all that, the description of nimrod as the "mighty hunter" and the
occurrence of a "hunter" in the babylonian epic (assyrian version
tablet i)--though he is not the hero--points to a confusion in
the hebrew form of the borrowed tradition between gilgamesh and
nimrod. the latest french translation of the epic is by dhorme,
_choix de textes religieux assyro-babyloniens_ (paris, 1907),
pp. 182-325; the latest german translation by ungnad-gressmann,
_das gilgamesch-epos_ (göttingen, 1911), with a valuable analysis
and discussion. these two translations now supersede jensen's
translation in the _keilinschriftliche bibliothek_, which, however,
is still valuable because of the detailed notes, containing a wealth

of _miscellaneous inscriptions in the yale babylonian collection_,
page 3, note. according to professor clay the original form of the
hero's name was west semitic, and was something like _bilga-mash_,
the meaning of which was perhaps "the offspring of mash." for the
first element in this division of the name cf. pilikam, the name of
a ruler of an early dynasty, and balak of the old testament. in view
of the fact that the axe figures so prominently in the epic as an
instrument wielded by gilgamesh, professor clay furthermore thinks it
reasonable to assume that the name was interpreted by the babylonian
scribe as "the axe of mash." in this way he would account for the
use of the determinative for weapons, which is also the sign gish,
in the name. it is certainly noteworthy that the ideogram gish-tún in
the later form of _gish-tún-mash_ = _pasu_, "axe," _ct_ xvi, 38:14b,
etc. _tun_ also = _pilaku_ "axe," _ct_ xii, 10:34b. names with similar
