ator when one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose
ears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her
natural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with:

"just fancy, flora, i met a young swedish governess to-day who told
me some most interesting things about the co-operative movement in
scandinavia. we really must have her to dine here one evening."

"to be sure!" said her sister flora, "but i haven't wasted my time
either. i met such a clever old gentleman at m. vinteuil's who knows
maubant quite well, and maubant has told him every little thing about
how he gets up his parts. it is the most interesting thing i ever heard.
he is a neighbour of m. vinteuil's, and i never knew; and he is so nice
besides."

"m. vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours," cried my aunt
céline in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed
forced because she had been planning the little speech for so long;
darting, as she spoke, what she called a 'sign

se interpolations, we would feel that the story
was not yet long enough, and would rally her with: "oh, but surely he
said something else as well. there was more than that, the first time
you told it."

my great-aunt herself would lay aside her work, and raise her head and
look on at us over her glasses.

the day had yet another characteristic feature, namely, that during may
we used to go out on saturday evenings after dinner to the 'month of
mary' devotions.

as we were liable, there, to meet m. vinteuil, who held very strict
views on "the deplorable untidiness of young people, which seems to
be encouraged in these days," my mother would first see that there was
nothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for
the church. it was in these 'month of mary' services that i can remember
having first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. the hawthorn was not
merely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us
a right of entry; but, arranged upon the altar itse

a flower had opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so
unconcernedly, like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of
stamens, slender as gossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a
white mist, that in following these with my eyes, in trying to imitate,
somewhere inside myself, the action of their blossoming, i imagined it
as a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance
from her contracted pupils, by a young girl in white, careless and
alive.

m. vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us.
he belonged to a good family, and had once been music-master to
my grandmother's sisters; so that when, after losing his wife and
inheriting some property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of
combray, we used often to invite him to our house. but with his intense
prudishness he had given up coming, so as not to be obliged to meet
swann, who had made what he called "a most unsuitable marriage, as
seems to be the fashion in these days."

 my mother, on hearing that he
'composed,' told him by way of a compliment that, when she came to see
him, he must play her something of his own. m. vinteuil would have liked
nothing better, but he carried politeness and consideration for others
to so fine a point, always putting himself in their place, that he was
afraid of boring them, or of appearing egotistical, if he carried out,
or even allowed them to suspect what were his own desires. on the day
when my parents had gone to pay him a visit, i had accompanied them,
but they had allowed me to remain outside, and as m. vinteuil's house,
montjouvain, stood on a site actually hollowed out from a s

covered with shrubs, among which i took cover, i had found myself on a
level with his drawing-room, upstairs, and only a few feet away from its
window. when a servant came in to tell him that my parents had arrived,
i had seen m. vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet of music
so as to catch the eye. but as soon as they entered the room he had
snatched it away and hidden it in a corner. he was afraid, no doubt, of
letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave
him a chance of playing them some of his compositions. and every time
that my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject
of his playing, he had hurriedly protested: "i cannot think who put that

neath their freckles. despite the heavy, motionless
silence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like
the murmuring of an intense vitality, with which the whole altar was
quivering like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which i
was reminded by seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed
to have kept the springtime virulence, the irritant power of stinging
insects now transmuted into flowers.

outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with m. vinteuil,
in the porch. boys would be chevying one another in the square, and he
would interfere, taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the
big. if his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she
had been to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and
more sensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless,
schoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was
angling for an invitation to the house. her father would then arrange

good taste in admiring, only such books and pictures as they would
continue to admire when their minds were developed and mature. no doubt
they regarded aesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded
vision could not fail to discern, without needing to have their
equivalent in experience of life stored up and slowly ripening in one's
heart.

it was along the 'méséglise way,' at montjouvain, a house built on the
edge of a large pond, and overlooked by a steep, shrub-grown hill, that
m. vinteuil lived. and so we used often to meet his daughter driving her
dogcart at full speed along the road. after a certain year we never
saw her alone, but always accompanied by a friend, a girl older than
herself, with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end
installed herself permanently, one day, at montjouvain. people said:
"that poor m. vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone
is talking about, and to let his daughter--a man who is horrified if you
use a word in the

 wrong sense--bring a woman like that to live under his
roof. he says that she is a most superior woman, with a heart of gold,
and that she would have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had
only been trained. he may be sure it is not music that she is teaching
his daughter." but m. vinteuil assured them that it was, and indeed
it is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their
normal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in
physical intercourse. bodily passion, which has been so unjustly
decried, compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them
of unselfishness and generosity, and so effectively that they shine
resplendent in the eyes of all beholders. dr. percepied, whose loud
voice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his hea

as every right to be fond of music, that
girl. i should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a
child; nor vinteuil either, it seems. and then he plays music too,
with his daughter's friend. why, gracious heavens, it must be a regular
musical box, that house out there! what are you laughing at? i say
they've been playing too much music, those people. i met papa vinteuil
the other day, by the cemetery. it was all he could do to keep on his
feet."

anyone who, like ourselves, had seen m. vinteuil, about this time,
avoiding people whom he knew, and turning away as soon as he caught
sight of them, changed in a few months into an old man, engulfed in a
sea of sorrows, incapable of any effort not directly aimed at promoting
his daughter's happiness, spending whole days beside his wife's grave,
could hardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a
broken heart, could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to
the rumours which were going about. he knew, perhaps he even

e saying. there is probably no one, however rigid
his virtue, who is not liable to find himself, by the complexity of
circumstances, living at close quarters with the very vice which
he himself has been most outspoken in condemning, without at first
recognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his
presence, so as to wound him and to make him suffer; the odd words, the
unaccountable attitude, one evening, of a person whom he has a thousand
reasons for loving. but for a man of m. vinteuil's sensibility it must
have been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have
to resign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed
to occur in bohemian circles only; for they are produced whenever there
needs to establish itself in the security necessary to its development a
vice which nature herself has planted in the soul of a child, perhaps by
no more than blending the virtues of its father and mother, as she might
blend the colours of their eyes. and yet h

may have known of his daughter's conduct it did not follow that his
adoration of her grew any less. the facts of life do not penetrate to
the sphere in which our beliefs are cherished; as it was not they that
engendered those beliefs, so they are powerless to destroy them; they
can aim at them continual blows of contradiction and disproof without
weakening them; and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming, one
after another, without interruption into the bosom of a family, will not

 lose faith in either the clemency of its god or the capacity of
its physician. but when m. vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself
from the point of view of the world, and of their reputation, when he
attempted to place himself by her side in the rank which they occupied
in the general estimation of their neighbours, then he was bound to give
judgment, to utter his own and her social condemnation in precisely
the terms which the inhabitant of combray most hostile to him and his
daughter would have employed; he saw himself and her in 'low,' in the
very 'lowest water,' inextricably stranded;

 and his manners had of late
been tinged with that humility, that respect for persons who ranked
above him and to whom he must now look up (however far beneath him they
might hitherto have been), that tendency to search for some means of
rising again to their level, which is an almost mechanical result of any
human misfortune.

one day, when we were walking with swann in one of the streets of
combray, m. vinteuil, turning out of another street, found himself so
suddenly face to face with us all that he had not time to escape; and
swann, with that almost arrogant charity of a man of the world who,
amid the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices, finds in another's
shame merely a reason for treating him with a friendly benevolence, the
outward signs of which serve to enhance and gratify the self-esteem of
the bestower because he feels that they are all the more precious to him

owed, conversed at great length with m. vinteuil,
with whom for a long time he had been barely on speaking terms, and
invited him, before leaving us, to send his daughter over, one day,
to play at tansonville. it was an invitation which, two years earlier,
would have enraged m. vinteuil, but which now filled him with so much
gratitude that he felt himself obliged to refrain from the indiscretion
of accepting. swann's friendly regard for his daughter seemed to him to
be in itself so honourable, so precious a support for his cause that he
felt it would perhaps be better to make no use of it, so as to have the
wholly platonic satisfaction of keeping it in reserve.

"what a charming man!" he said to us, after swann had gone, with the
same enthusiasm and veneration which make cleve

r and pretty women of the
middle classes fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a
duchess, even though she be ugly and a fool. "what a charming man! what
a pity that he should have made such a deplorable marriage!"

and then, so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most
sincere of men, who cast off, while they are talking to anyone, the
opinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer
there, my family joined with m. vinteuil in deploring swann's marriage,
invoking principles and conventions which (all the more because they
invoked them in common with him, as though we were all thorough good
fellows of the same sort) they appeared to suggest were in no way
infringed at montjouvain. m. vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit
swann, an omission which swann was the first to regret. for constantly,
after meeting m. vinteuil, he would remember that he had been meaning
for a long time to ask him about some one of the

same name as himself,
one of his relatives, swann supposed. and on this occasion he determined
that he would not forget what he had to say to him when m. vinteuil
should appear with his daughter at tansonville.

since the 'méséglise way' was the shorter of the two that we used to
take for our walks round combray, and for that reason was reserved for
days of uncertain weather, it followed that the climate of méséglise
shewed an unduly high rainfall, and we would never lose sight of the
fringe of roussainville wood, so that we could, at any moment, run for
shelter beneath its dense thatch of leaves.

ither the accidental setting or
the direct inspiration and cause, i am reminded that it was in that same
autumn, on one of those walks, near the bushy precipice which guarded
montjouvain from the rear, that i was struck for the first time by
this lack of harmony between our impressions and their normal forms of
expression. after an hour of rain and wind, against which i had put up a
brisk fight, as i came to the edge of the montjouvain pond, and reached
a little hut, roofed with tiles, in which m. vinteuil's gardener kept
his tools, the sun shone out again, and its golden rays, washed clean
by the shower, blazed once more in the sky, on the trees, on the wall
of the hut, and on the still wet tiles of the roof, which had a chicken
perching upon its ridge. the wind pulled out sideways the wild grass
that grew in the wall, and the chicken's downy feathers, both of which
things let themselves float upon the wind's breath to their full extent,

 my life. it was during a spell of very hot
weather; my parents, who had been obliged to go away for the whole day,
had told me that i might stay out as late as i pleased; and having
gone as far as the montjouvain pond, where i enjoyed seeing again the
reflection of the tiled roof of the hut, i had lain down in the shade
and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up
behind the house, just where i had waited for my parents, years before,
one day when they had gone to call on m. vinteuil. it was almost dark
when i awoke, and i wished to rise and go away, but i saw mlle. vinteuil
(or thought, at least, that i recognised her, for i had not seen her
often at combray, and then only when she was still a child, whereas
she was now growing into a young woman), who probably had just come in,
standing in front of me, and only a few feet away from me, in that room
in which her father had entertained mine, and which she had now made
into a little sitting-room for herself. the window was p

she was in deep mourning, for her father had but lately died. we had
not gone to see her; my mother had not cared to go, on account of that
virtue which alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence--namely,
modesty; but she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart. my
mother had not forgotten the sad end of m. vinteuil's life, his complete
absorption, first in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his
daughter, and, later, in the suffering which she had caused him; she
could see the tortured expression which was never absent from the old
man's face in those terrible last years; she knew that he had definitely
abandoned the task of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later
work, the poor little pieces, we imagined, of an old music-master, a
retired village organist, which, we assumed, were of

 little or no value
in themselves, though we did not despise them, because they were of such
great value to him and had been the chief motive of his life before he
sacrificed them to his daughter; pieces which, being mostly not even
written down, but recorded only in his memory, while the rest were
scribbled on loose sheets of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain
unknown for ever; my mother thought, also, of that other and still more
cruel renunciation to which m. vinteuil had been driven, that of seeing
the girl happily settled, with an honest and respectable future; when
she called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come
upon my aunts' old music-master, she was moved to very real grief, and
shuddered to think of that other grief, so different in its bitterness,
which mlle. vinteuil must now be feeling, tinged with remorse at having
virtually killed her father. "poor m. vinteuil," my mother would say,
"he lived for his daughter, and now he has d

ied for her, without getting
his reward. will he get it now, i wonder, and in what form? it can only
come to him from her."

at the far end of mlle. vinteuil's sitting-room, on the mantelpiece,
stood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch,
just as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside,
then flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little
table on which she placed the photograph, just as, long ago, m. vinteuil
had 'placed' beside him the piece of music which he would have liked
to play over to my parents. and then her friend came in. mlle. vinteuil
greeted her without rising, clasping her hands behind her head, and
drew her body to one side of the sofa, as though to 'make room.' but no
sooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps
suggesting a particular position to her friend, with an emphasis which
might well be regarded as importunate. she thought that her friend would

of her friend. but the latter now had her back
turned to the little table on which the old music-master's portrait had
been arranged. mlle. vinteuil realised that her friend would not see
it unless her attention were drawn to it, and so exclaimed, as if she
herself had just noticed it for the first time: "oh! there's my father's
picture looking at us; i can't think who can have put it there; i'm sure
i've told them twenty times, that is not the proper place for it."

i remembered the words that m. vinteuil had used to my parents in
apologising for an obtrusive sheet of music. this photograph was, of
course, in common use in their ritual observances, was subjected to
daily profanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently
a liturgical response: "let him stay there. he can't trouble us any
longer. d'you think he'd start whining, d'you think he'd pack you out
of the house if he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old
monkey?"

to which mlle. vinteuil replied, "oh, pleas

e of an orphan.

"do you know what i should like to do to that old horror?" she said,
taking up the photograph. she murmured in mlle. vinteuil's ear something
that i could not distinguish.

"oh! you would never dare."

"not dare to spit on it? on that?" shouted the friend with deliberate
brutality.

i heard no more, for mlle. vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward,
preoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew
the shutters close; but i knew now what was the reward that m. vinteuil,
in return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on
account of his daughter, had received from her after his death.

and yet i have since reflected that if m. vinteuil had been able to be
present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have
continued to believe in his daughter's soundness of heart, and that he
might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. it was true
that in all mlle. vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so
strong and
