schrödinger was that the waves were "smeared-out" electrons. this captured some of the "feeling" of
an electron wave, but it was too rough. when you smear something out, part of it is here and part of it
is there. however, one never encounters half of an electron or a third of an electron or any other
fraction,  for  that  matter.  this  makes  it  hard  to  grasp  what  a  smeared  electron  actually  is. as  an
alternative, in 1926 german physicist max born sharply refined schrödinger's interpretation of an
electron wave, and it is his interpretation—amplified by bohr and his colleagues—that is still with us
today.  born's  suggestion  is  one  of  the  strangest  features  of  quantum  theory,  but  is  supported
nonetheless by an enormous amount of experimental data. he asserted that an electron wave must be
interpreted from the standpoint of probability. places where the magnitude (a bit more correctly, the
square of magnitude) of the wave
