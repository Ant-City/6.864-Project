distant from old ways of thinking. but the uncertainty principle cleanly and definitively undercut any
attempt to cling to the past.

the uncertainty principle tells us that the universe is a frenetic place when examined on smaller

and  smaller  distances  and  shorter  and  shorter  time  scales.  we  saw  some  evidence  of  this  in  our
attempt, described in the preceding chapter, to pinpoint the location of elementary particles such as
electrons: by shining light of ever higher frequency on electrons, we measure their position with ever
greater precision, but at a cost, since our observations become ever more disruptive. high-frequency
photons have a lot of energy and therefore give the electrons a sharp "kick," significantly changing
their velocities. like the frenzy in a room full of children all of whose momentary positions you know
with great accuracy but over whose velocities—the speeds and directions in which

in  fact,  had  experiments  revealed  a  somewhat  different  particle  content  in  the  microscopic
world,  possibly  interacting  with  somewhat  different  forces,  these  changes  could  have  been  fairly
easily incorporated in the standard model by providing the theory with different input parameters. the
structure of the standard model, in this sense, is too flexible to be able to explain the properties of the
elementary particles, as it could have accommodated a range of possibilities.

string theory is dramatically different. it is a unique and inflexible theoretical edifice. it requires
no input beyond a single number, described below, that sets the benchmark scale for measurements.
all properties of the microworld are within the realm of its explanatory power. to understand this,
let's first think about more familiar strings, such as those on a violin. each such string can undergo a

holds for the messenger particles themselves. particles like photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons
are yet other resonant patterns of string vibration. and of particular importance, among the vibrational
string patterns, one matches perfectly the properties of the graviton, ensuring that gravity is an integral
part of string theory.7

so we see that, according to string theory, the observed properties of each elementary particle
arise because its internal string undergoes a particular resonant vibrational pattern. this perspective
differs sharply from that espoused by physicists before the discovery of string theory; in the earlier
perspective the differences among the fundamental particles were explained by saying that, in effect,
each  particle  species  was  "cut  from  a  different  fabric."  although  each  particle  was  viewed  as
elementary,  the  kind  of  "stuff"  each  embodied  was  thought  to  be  differe

example,  had  negative  electric  charge,  while  neutrino  "stuff"  had  no  electric  charge.  string  theory
alters this picture radically by declaring that the "stuff" of all matter and all forces is the same. each
elementary particle is composed of a single string—that is, each particle is a single string—and all
strings  are  absolutely  identical.  differences  between  the  particles  arise  because  their  respective
strings  undergo  different  resonant  vibrational  patterns.  what  appear  to  be  different  elementary
particles are actually different "notes" on a fundamental string. the universe—being composed of an
enormous number of these vibrating strings—is akin to a cosmic symphony.

elementary  level,  describable  in  terms  of  forces  acting  between  these  elementary  material
constituents, string theory provides the promise of a single, all-inclusive, unified description of the
physical universe: a theory of everything (t.o.e.).

the music of string theory

even though string theory does away with the previous concept of structureless elementary particles,
old language dies hard, especially when it provides an accurate description of reality down to the
most  minute  of  distance  scales.  following  the  common  practice  of  the  field  we  shall  therefore
continue to refer to "elementary particles," yet we will always mean "what appear to be elementary
particles but are actually tiny pieces of vibrating string." in the preceding section we proposed that
the masses and the force charges of such elementary particles are the result of the way 
 
 ___________________________
 
in which their
respective  strings  are  vibrating.  this  leads  us  to  the  following  realization:  if  we  can  work  out
precisely the allowed resonant vibrational patterns of fundamental strings—the "notes," so to speak,
that they can play—we should be able to explain the observed properties of the elementary particles.
for the first time, therefore, string theory sets up a framework for explaining the properties of the
particles observed in nature.

at  this  stage,  then,  we  should  "grab  hold"  of  a  string  and  "pluck"  it  in  all  sorts  of  ways  to
determine the possible resonant patterns of vibration. if string theory is right, we should find that the
possible patterns yield exactly the observed properties of the matter and force particles in tables 1.1
and 1.2. of course, a string is too small

portional  to  the  tension  of  the  string  (and  it  is  also
proportional to the number of peaks and troughs in the particular vibrational pattern), while the whole
number multiple is determined by the amplitude of the vibrational pattern.

the  key  point  for  the  present  discussion  is  this:  since  the  minimal  energy  denominations  are
proportional  to  the  string's  tension,  and  since  this  tension  is  enormous,  the  fundamental  minimal
energies are, on the usual scales of elementary particle physics, similarly huge. they are multiples of
what is known as the planck energy. to get a sense of scale, if we translate the planck energy into a

mass using einstein's famous conversion formula e = mc2, they correspond to masses that are on the
order  of  ten  billion  billion  (1019)  times  that  of  a  proton.  this  gargantuan  mass—by  elementary
particle standards—is known as the planck mass; it's about equal to the mass of a grain of dust or a
collection of a million average bac

tive to these finest of details can be
extracted and understood with confidence.

this takes us to the third consequence of the enormous value of the string tension. strings can
execute an infinite number of different vibrational patterns. for instance, in figure 6.2 we showed the
beginnings of a never-ending sequence of possibilities characterized by an ever greater number of
peaks  and  troughs.  doesn't  this  mean  that  there  would  have  to  be  a  corresponding  never-ending
sequence of elementary particles, seemingly in conflict with the experimental situation summarized in
tables 1.1 and 1.2?

the answer is yes: if string theory is right, each of the infinitely many resonant patterns of string
vibration should correspond to an elementary particle. an essential point, however, is that the high
string tension ensures that all but a few of these vibrational patterns will correspond to extremely
heavy particles (the few being the lowest-energy vibrations that have near-perfect cancellations with

fluctuations are now seen to have arisen in our theories because we were unaware
of  these  limits  and  were  thus  led  by  a  point-particle  approach  to  grossly  overstep  the  bounds  of

physical reality.

given  the  apparent  simplicity  of  this  solution  for  overcoming  the  problem  between  general
relativity and quantum mechanics, you might wonder why it took so long for someone to suggest that
the point-particle description is merely an idealization and that in the real world elementary particles
do have some spatial extent. this takes us to our second point. long ago, some of the greatest minds
in  theoretical  physics,  such  as  pauli,  heisenberg,  dirac,  and  feynman, did  suggest  that  nature's
constituents might not actually be points but rather small undulating "blobs" or "nuggets." they and
others found, however, that it is very hard to construct a theory, whose fundamental constituent is not
a  point  particle,  that  is  nonetheless  consistent  with  the  most  basic  of

consider the way in which point particles would interact, if they were actually to exist,
and hence how they could be used as physical probes. the most basic interaction is between two
point particles moving on a collision course so that their trajectories will intersect, as in figure 6.5.
if these particles were billiard balls they would collide, and each would be deflected onto a new
trajectory.  point-particle  quantum  field  theory  shows  that  essentially  the  same  thing  happens  when
elementary particles collide—they scatter off one another and continue on deflected trajectories—but
the details are a little different.

figure 6.5 two particles interact—they "slam together"—and cause the path of each to be deflected.

other is its antiparticle, the positron. when matter and antimatter collide, they can annihilate in a flash

symmetries sensitive to something known as spin.

dimensions that must be curled up to a very small size to be consistent with our never having seen
them. but a tiny string can probe a tiny space. as a string moves about, oscillating as it travels, the
geometrical  form  of  the  extra  dimensions  plays  a  critical  role  in  determining  resonant  patterns  of
vibration.  because  the  patterns  of  string  vibrations  appear  to  us  as  the  masses  and  charges  of  the
elementary particles, we conclude that these fundamental properties of the universe are determined, in
large measure, by the geometrical size and shape of the extra dimensions. that's one of the most far-
reaching insights of string theory.

since the extra dimensions so profoundly influence basic physical properties of the universe, we
should now seek—with unbridled vigor—an understanding of what these curled-up dimensions look
like.

toward this goal. they not only found that the extra dimensions in string theory must be curled up into

patterns  of  string  vibrations.  one  central  result  they  found  highlights  the  amazingly  unexpected
solutions string theory offers to long-standing particle-physics problems.

recall that the elementary particles that physicists have found fall into three families of identical
organization, with the particles in each successive family being increasingly massive. the puzzling
question for which there was no insight prior to string theory is, why families and why three? here is
string theory's proposal. a typical calabi-yau shape contains  holes that are analogous to those found
at the center of a phonograph record, or a doughnut, or a "multidoughnut", as shown in figure 9.1. in

can arise—holes which themselves can have a variety of dimensions ("multidimensional holes")—but
figure 9.1 conveys the basic idea. candelas, horowitz, strominger, and witten closely examined the
effect that these holes have on the possible patterns of string vibration, and here is what they found.

there is a family of lowest-energy string vibrations associated with each hole in the calabi-yau
portion of space. because the familiar elementary particles should correspond to the lowest-energy
oscillatory  patterns,  the  existence  of  multiple  holes—somewhat  like  those  in  the  multidoughnut—
means that the patterns of string vibrations will fall into multiple families. if the curled-up calabi-

proclaims that the family organization observed experimentally, rather than being some unexplainable

prediction  that  each  such  known  particle  will  have  a  superpartner.  we  can  determine  the  force
charges that each of these superpartner particles should carry, but we do not currently have the ability
to predict their masses. even so, the prediction that superpartners exist is a generic feature of string
theory;  it  is  a  property  of  string  theory  that  is  true,  independent  of  those  aspects  of  the  theory  we
haven't yet figured out.

no superpartners of the known elementary particles have ever been observed. this might mean
that they do not exist and that string theory is wrong. but many particle physicists feel that it means

second,  could  such  a  topology-changing  tear  happen  today  or  tomorrow?  could  it  have
happened  in  the  past? yes.  experimental  measurements  of  elementary  particle  masses  show  their
values to be quite stable over time. but if we head back to the earliest epochs following the big bang,
even non-string-based theories invoke important periods during which elementary particle masses do
change over time. these periods, from a string-theoretic perspective, could certainly have involved
the topology-changing tears discussed in this chapter. closer to the present, the observed stability of
elementary particle masses implies that if the universe is currently undergoing a topology-changing
spatial tear, it must be doing it exceedingly slowly—so slowly that its effect on elementary particle
masses is smaller than our present experimental sensitivity. remarkably, so long

occurred  at  the  moment  of  the  big  bang  and  that  prevail  within  black  holes cannot  be  understood
without  a  quantum  mechanical  formulation  of  the  gravitational  force.  with  the  discovery  of  string
theory, we now have a hope of solving these deep mysteries. in this and the next chapter, we describe
how far string theorists have gone toward understanding black holes and the origin of the universe.

black holes and elementary particles

at  first  sight  it's  hard  to  imagine  any  two  things  more  radically  different  than  black  holes  and
elementary  particles.  we  usually  picture  black  holes  as  the  most  gargantuan  of  heavenly  bodies,
whereas elementary particles are the most minute specks of matter. but the research of a number of
physicists during the late 1960s and early 1970s, including demetrios christodoulou, werner israel,
richard  price,  brandon  carter,  roy  kerr,  david  robinson,  hawking,  a

nd  penrose,  showed  that
black holes and elementary particles are perhaps not as different as one might think. these physicists
found  increasingly  persuasive  evidence  for  what  john  wheeler  has  summarized  by  the  statement
"black holes have no hair." by this, wheeler meant that except for a small number of distinguishing
features, all black holes appear to be alike. the distinguishing features? one, of course, is the black
hole's mass. what are the others? research has revealed that they are the electric and certain other
force charges a black

arges, and spin are completely identical. black holes do not have
fancy "hairdos"—that is, other intrinsic traits—that distinguish one from another. this should ring a
loud bell. recall that it is precisely such properties—mass, force charges, and spin—that distinguish
one  elementary  particle  from  another.  the  similarity  of  the  defining  traits  has  led  a  number  of
physicists  over  the  years  to  the  strange  speculation  that  black  holes  might  actually  be  gigantic
elementary particles.

in fact, according to einstein's theory, there is no minimum mass for a black hole. if we crush a
chunk of matter of any mass to a small enough size, a straightforward application of general relativity
shows that it will become a black hole. (the lighter the mass, the smaller we must crush it.) and so,
we can imagine a thought experiment in which we start with ever-lighter blobs of matter, crush them
into  ever-smaller  black  holes,  and  compare  the  properties  of  the  resulting  black

 holes  with  the
properties of elementary particles. wheeler's no-hair statement leads us to conclude that for small
enough masses the black holes we form in this manner will look very much like elementary particles.
both will look like tiny bundles characterized completely by their mass, force charges, and spin.

but there is a catch. astrophysical black holes, with masses many times that of the sun, are so
large  and  heavy  that  quantum  mechanics  is  largely  irrelevant  and  only  the  equations  of  general
relativity need be used to understand their properties. (we are here discussing the overall structure of
the black hole, not the singular central point of collapse within a black hole, whose t

certainly  requires  a  quantum-mechanical  description.) as  we  try  to  make  ever  less  massive  black
holes, however, there comes a point when they are so light and small that quantum mechanics does
comes into play. this happens if the total mass of the black hole is about the planck mass or less.
(from the point of view of elementary particle physics, the planck mass is huge—some ten billion
billion times the mass of a proton. from the point of view of black holes, though, the planck mass,
being equal to that of an average grain of dust, is quite tiny.) and so, physicists who speculated that
tiny  black  holes  and  elementary  particles  might  be  closely  related  immediately  ran  up  against  the
incompatibility  between  general  relativity—the  theoretical  heart  of  black  holes—and  quantum
mechanics. in the past, th

it  does.  through  a  fairly  unexpected  and  sophisticated  realization  of  black  holes,  string  theory
provides the first theoretically sound connection between black holes and elementary particles. the
road  to  this  connection  is  a  bit  circuitous,  but  it  takes  us  through  some  of  the  most  interesting
developments in string theory, making it a journey well worth taking.

it begins with a seemingly unrelated question that string theorists have kicked around since the
late  1980s.  mathematicians  and  physicists  have  long  known  that  when  six  spatial  dimensions  are

among the many e-mail responses was one from plesser, who gave us one of the highest compliments
one physicist can give another by declaring, "i wish that i had thought of that!" notwithstanding our
fears the previous night, we had convinced the string theory community that not only can the fabric of
space undergo the mild tears discovered earlier (chapter 11), but that far more drastic rips, roughly
illustrated by figure 13.3, can occur as well.

returning to black holes and elementary particles

what does this have to do with black holes and elementary particles? a lot. to see this, we must ask
ourselves the same question we posed in chapter 11. what are the observable physical consequences
of such tears in the fabric of space? for flop transitions, as we have seen, the surprising answer to
this question was that not much happens at all. for conifold transitions—the technical name for the
drastic space-tearing transitions we had now found—there is, once again, no physical catast

shape goes through a space-tearing conifold transition, an initially massive black hole becomes ever
lighter until it is massless and then it transmutes into a massless particle—such as a massless photon
—which in string theory is nothing but a single string executing a particular vibrational pattern. in this
way,  for  the  first  time,  string  theory  explicitly  establishes  a  direct,  concrete,  and  quantitatively
unassailable connection between black holes and elementary particles.

"melting" black holes

the  connection  between  black  holes  and  elementary  particles  which  we  found  is  closely  akin  to
something we are all familiar with from day-to-day life, known technically as a phase transition. a
simple example of a phase transition is the one we mentioned in the last chapter: water can exist as a
solid (ice), as a liquid (liquid water), and a gas (steam). these are known as the phases of water, and
the transformation from one form to another is called a ph

se, the initial calabi-yau shape (the analog of the ice phase, say), we
find that there are certain black holes present. in the second phase, the second calabi-yau shape (the
analog of the liquid water phase), these black holes have gone through a phase transition—they have
"melted"  so  to  speak—into  fundamental  vibrational  string  patterns.  the  tearing  of  space  through

conifold transitions takes us from one calabi-yau phase to the other. in so doing, we see that black
holes and elementary particles, like water and ice, are two sides of the same coin. we see that black
holes snugly fit within the framework of string theory.

we have purposely used the same water analogy for these drastic space-tearing transmutations
and for the transmutations from one of the five formulations of string theory to another (chapter 12)
because they are deeply connected. recall that we expressed through figure 12.11 that the five string
theories  are  dual  to  one  another  and  thereby  are  unified  under

in others, physics may differ in more pronounced ways: the up-quark might weigh ten times what it
weighs in our universe, or the strength of the electromagnetic force might be ten times the value we
measure,  with  all  the  profound  implications  that  this  has  on  stars  and  on  life  as  we  know  it  (as
indicated in chapter 1). and in other universes, physics may differ in still more dramatic ways: the
list of elementary particles and forces may be completely distinct from ours, or, taking a cue from
string  theory,  even  the  number  of  extended  dimensions  may  differ,  with  some  cramped  universes
having as few as zero or one large spatial dimension, while other expansive universes possess eight,
nine,  or  even  ten  extended  spatial  dimensions.  if  we  let  our  imaginations  run  free,  even  the  laws
themselves can drastically differ from universe to universe. the range of possibilities is endless.
