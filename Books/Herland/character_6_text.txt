â€œbut they are interesting--i like them,â€ jeff objected, â€œand iâ€™m sure
they are educational.â€

â€œiâ€™m sick and tired of being educated,â€ terry protested. â€œfancy going to
a dame school--at our age. i want to get out!â€

but we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly. our
special tutors rose rapidly in our esteem. they seemed of rather finer
quality than the guards, though all were on terms of easy friendliness.
mine was named somel, jeffâ€™s zava, and terryâ€™s moadine. we tried to
generalize from the names, those of the guards, and of our three girls,
but got nowhere.

â€œthey sound well enough, and theyâ€™re mostly short, but thereâ€™s no
similarity of termination--and no two alike. however, our acquaintance
is limited as yet.â€

there were many things we meant to ask--as soon as we could talk well
enough. better teaching i never saw. from morning to night there was
somel, always on call except between two and four; always pleasant with
a steady friendly k

und later.

little by little they wrung from us the fact that the friend of man,
in the city, was a prisoner; was taken out for his meager exercise on
a leash; was liable not only to many diseases but to the one destroying
horror of rabies; and, in many cases, for the safety of the citizens,
had to go muzzled. jeff maliciously added vivid instances he had known
or read of injury and death from mad dogs.

they did not scold or fuss about it. calm as judges, those women were.
but they made notes; moadine read them to us.

â€œplease tell me if i have the facts correct,â€ she said. â€œin your
country--and in others too?â€

â€œyes,â€ we admitted, â€œin most civilized countries.â€

â€œin most civilized countries a kind of animal is kept which is no longer
useful--â€

â€œthey are a protection,â€ terry insisted. â€œthey bark if burglars try to
get in.â€

then she made notes of â€œburglarsâ€ and went on: â€œbecause of the love
which people bear to this animal.â€

zava interrupted here. â€œis

 the unfit perish. in our economic
struggle, i continued, there was always plenty of opportunity for the
fittest to reach the top, which they did, in great numbers, particularly
in our country; that where there was severe economic pressure the lowest
classes of course felt it the worst, and that among the poorest of all
the women were driven into the labor market by necessity.

they listened closely, with the usual note-taking.

â€œabout one-third, then, belong to the poorest class,â€ observed moadine
gravely. â€œand two-thirds are the ones who are--how was it you so
beautifully put it?--â€˜loved, honored, kept in the home to care for the
children.â€™ this inferior one-third have no children, i suppose?â€

jeff--he was getting as bad as they were--solemnly replied that, on the
contrary, the poorer they were, the more children they had. that too, he
explained, was a law of nature: â€œreproduction is in inverse proportion
to individuation.â€

â€œthese â€˜laws of nature,â€™â€ zava gently ask

ed, â€œare they all the laws you
have?â€

â€œi should say not!â€ protested terry. â€œwe have systems of law that go
back thousands and thousands of years--just as you do, no doubt,â€ he
finished politely.

â€œoh no,â€ moadine told him. â€œwe have no laws over a hundred years old,
and most of them are under twenty. in a few weeks more,â€ she continued,
â€œwe are going to have the pleasure of showing you over our little land
and explaining everything you care to know about. we want you to see our
people.â€

â€œand i assure you,â€ somel added, â€œthat our people want to see you.â€

terry brightened up immensely at this news, and reconciled himself to
the renewed demands upon our capacity as teachers. it was lucky t

 equal to ours
at home; and by the time we were led forth to lecture, our audiences
had thoroughly mastered a well-arranged digest of all we had previously
given to our teachers, and were prepared with such notes and questions
as might have intimidated a university professor.

they were not audiences of girls, either. it was some time before we
were allowed to meet the young women.


â€œdo you mind telling what you intend to do with us?â€ terry burst
forth one day, facing the calm and friendly moadine with that funny
half-blustering air of his. at first he used to storm and flourish quite
a good deal, but nothing seemed to amuse them more; they would gather
around and watch him as if it was an exhibition, politely, but with
evident interest. so he learned to check himself, and was almost
reasonable in his bearing--but not quite.

she announced smoothly and evenly: â€œnot in the least. i thought it was
quite plain. we are trying to learn of you all we can, and to teach you

shown the action of a practical intelligence, coupled with fine artistic
feeling, and, apparently, untrammeled by any injurious influences.

our first step of comparative freedom was a personally conducted tour of
the country. no pentagonal bodyguard now! only our special tutors,
and we got on famously with them. jeff said he loved zava like an
aunt--â€œonly jollier than any aunt i ever sawâ€; somel and i were as
chummy as could be--the best of friends; but it was funny to watch terry
and moadine. she was patient with him, and courteous, but it was like
the patience and courtesy of some great man, say a skilled, experienced
diplomat, with a schoolgirl. her grave acquiescence with his most
preposterous expression of feeling; her genial laughter, not only
with, but, i often felt, at him--though impeccably polite; her
innocent questions, which almost invariably led him to say more than he
intended--jeff and i found it all amusing to watch.

he never seemed to recognize that quiet backgroun

me cases his reputation for what was
felicitously termed â€œgaietyâ€ seemed a special charm.

but here, against the calm wisdom and quiet restrained humor of these
women, with only that blessed jeff and my inconspicuous self to compare
with, terry did stand out rather strong.

as â€œa man among men,â€ he didnâ€™t; as a man among--i shall have to say,
â€œfemales,â€ he didnâ€™t; his intense masculinity seemed only fit complement
to their intense femininity. but here he was all out of drawing.

moadine was a big woman, with a balanced strength that seldom showed.
her eye was as quietly watchful as a fencerâ€™s. she maintained a pleasant
relation with her charge, but i doubt if many, even in that country,
could have done as well.

he called her â€œmaud,â€ amongst ourselves, and said she was â€œa good old
soul, but a little slowâ€; wherein he was quite wrong. needless to
say, he called jeffâ€™s teacher â€œjava,â€ and sometimes â€œmocha,â€ or plain
â€œcoffeeâ€; when specially mischievous, â

€œchicory,â€ and even â€œpostum.â€ but
somel rather escaped this form of humor, save for a rather forced â€œsome
â€˜ell.â€

â€œdonâ€™t you people have but one name?â€ he asked one day, after we
had been introduced to a whole group of them, all with pleasant,
few-syllabled strange names, like the ones we knew.

â€œoh yes,â€ moadine told him. â€œa good many of us have another, as we get
on in life--a descriptive one. that is the name we earn. sometimes even
that is changed, or added to, in an unusually rich life. such as our
present land mother--what you call president or king, i believe. she
was called mera, even as a child; that means â€˜thinker.â€™ later there
was added du--du-mera--the wise thinker, and now we all know her as
o-du-mera--great and wise thinker. you shall meet her.â€

â€œno surnames at all then?â€ purs

furniture, on the dishes sometimes. because otherwise one is likely to
forget, and we want to know to whom to be grateful.â€

â€œyou speak as if it were done for the convenience of the consumer--not
the pride of the producer,â€ i suggested.

â€œitâ€™s both,â€ said somel. â€œwe have pride enough in our work.â€

â€œthen why not in your children?â€ urged jeff.

â€œbut we have! weâ€™re magnificently proud of them,â€ she insisted.

â€œthen why not sign â€˜em?â€ said terry triumphantly.

moadine turned to him with her slightly quizzical smile. â€œbecause the
finished product is not a private one. when they are babies, we do speak
of them, at times, as â€˜essaâ€™s lato,â€™ or â€˜novineâ€™s amelâ€™; but that is
merely descriptive and conversational. in the records, of course,
the child stands in her own line of mothers; but in dealing with it
personally it is lato, or amel, without dragging in its ancestors.â€

â€œbut have you names enough to give a new one to each child?â€

. when i got back to our own padded armor and its
starched borders i realized with acute regret how comfortable were those
herland clothes.

we scanned that audience, looking for the three bright faces we knew;
but they were not to be seen. just a multitude of girls: quiet, eager,
watchful, all eyes and ears to listen and learn.

we had been urged to give, as fully as we cared to, a sort of synopsis
of world history, in brief, and to answer questions.

â€œwe are so utterly ignorant, you see,â€ moadine had explained to us. â€œwe
know nothing but such science as we have worked out for ourselves,
just the brain work of one small half-country; and you, we gather, have
helped one another all over the globe, sharing your discoveries, pooling
your progress. how wonderful, how supremely beautiful your civilization
must be!â€

somel gave a further suggestion.

â€œyou do not have to begin all over again, as you did with us. we have
made a sort of digest of what we have learned from you, and it has be

 say, an increasing inability on our
part to answer them effectively.

our special guides, who were on the platform with us, and sometimes
aided in clarifying a question or, oftener, an answer, noticed this
effect, and closed the formal lecture part of the evening rather
shortly.

â€œour young women will be glad to meet you,â€ somel suggested, â€œto talk
with you more personally, if you are willing?â€

willing! we were impatient and said as much, at which i saw a flickering
little smile cross moadineâ€™s face. even then, with all those eager young
things waiting to talk to us, a sudden question crossed my mind: â€œwhat
was their point of view? what did they think of us?â€ we learned that
later.

terry plunged in among those young creatures with a sort of rapture,
somewhat as a glad swimmer takes to the sea. jeff, with a rapt look on
his high-bred face, approached as to a sacrament. but i was a little
chilled by that last thought of mine, and kept my eyes open. i found
time to watch jeff, e

 and i feared the worst. we tried to
caution him--much good that did. the big handsome fellow drew himself up
to his full height, lifted that great chest of his, and laughed.

â€œthere are three separate marriages,â€ he said. â€œi wonâ€™t interfere with
yours--nor you with mine.â€

so the great day came, and the countless crowds of women, and we three
bridegrooms without any supporting â€œbest men,â€ or any other men to back
us up, felt strangely small as we came forward.

somel and zava and moadine were on hand; we were thankful to have them,
too--they seemed almost like relatives.

there was a splendid procession, wreathing dances, the new anthem i
spoke of, and the whole great place pulsed with feeling--the deep awe,
the sweet hope, the wondering expectation of a new miracle.

â€œthere has been nothing like this in the country since our motherhood
began!â€ somel said softly to me, while we watched the symbolic marches.
â€œyou see, it is the dawn of a new era. you donâ€™t know how much

 had at first, and were unable to meet sanely
and dispassionately. i fancy too--this is pure conjecture--that he
had succeeded in driving alima beyond her best judgment, her real
conscience, and that after that her own sense of shame, the reaction of
the thing, made her bitter perhaps.

they quarreled, really quarreled, and after making it up once or twice,
they seemed to come to a real break--she would not be alone with him
at all. and perhaps she was a bit nervous, i donâ€™t know, but she got
moadine to come and stay next door to her. also, she had a sturdy
assistant detailed to accompany her in her work.

terry had his own ideas, as iâ€™ve tried to show. i daresay he thought he
had a right to do as he did. perhaps he even convinced himself that
it would be better for her. anyhow, he hid himself in her bedroom one
night...

the women of herland have no fear of men. why should they have? they
are not timid in any sense. they are not weak; and they all have strong
trained athletic bodies. oth

ello could not have extinguished alima with
a pillow, as if she were a mouse.

terry put in practice his pet conviction that a woman loves to be
mastered, and by sheer brute force, in all the pride and passion of his
intense masculinity, he tried to master this woman.

it did not work. i got a pretty clear account of it later from ellador,
but what we heard at the time was the noise of a tremendous struggle,
and alima calling to moadine. moadine was close by and came at once; one
or two more strong grave women followed.

terry dashed about like a madman; he would cheerfully have killed
them--he told me that, himself--but he couldnâ€™t. when he swung a chair
over his head one sprang in the air and caught it, two threw themselves
bodily upon him and forced him to the floor; it was only the work of a
few moments to have him tied hand and foot, and then, in sheer pity for
his futile rage, to anesthetize him.

alima was in a cold fury. she

about sex.â€

when terry said sex, sex with a very large _s_, he meant the male sex,
naturally; its special values, its profound conviction of being â€œthe
life force,â€ its cheerful ignoring of the true life process, and its
interpretation of the other sex solely from its own point of view.

i had learned to see these things very differently since living with
ellador; and as for jeff, he was so thoroughly herlandized that he
wasnâ€™t fair to terry, who fretted sharply in his new restraint.

moadine, grave and strong, as sadly patient as a mother with a
degenerate child, kept steady watch on him, with enough other women
close at hand to prevent an outbreak. he had no weapons, and well knew
that all his strength was of small avail against those grim, quiet
women.

we were allowed to visit him freely, but he had only his room, and a
small high-walled garden to walk in, while the preparations for our
departure were under way.

three of us were to go: terry, because he must; i, because two wer

me?â€

she was keen for coming. so the plans went on. sheâ€™d have liked to wait
for that marvel of celisâ€™s, but terry had no such desire. he was crazy
to be out of it all. it made him sick, he said, sick; this everlasting
mother-mother-mothering. i donâ€™t think terry had what the phrenologists
call â€œthe lump of philoprogenitivenessâ€ at all well developed.

â€œmorbid one-sided cripples,â€ he called them, even when from his window
he could see their splendid vigor and beauty; even while moadine, as
patient and friendly as if she had never helped alima to hold and bind
him, sat there in the room, the picture of wisdom and serene strength.
â€œsexless, epicene, undeveloped neuters!â€ he went on bitterly. he sounded
like sir almwroth wright.

well--it was hard. he was madly in love with alima, really; more so than
he had ever been before, and their tempestuous courtship, quarrels, and
reconciliations had fanned the flame. and then when he sought by that
supreme conquest which seems so na

e did not submit he would slay her,
slay a slave and place him beside her and say he found him there. a poor
device, it always seemed to me. if mr. lucretius had asked him how he
came to be in his wifeâ€™s bedroom overlooking her morals, what could he
have said? but the point is lucrese submitted, and alima didnâ€™t.

â€œshe kicked me,â€ confided the embittered prisoner--he had to talk to
someone. â€œi was doubled up with the pain, of course, and she jumped on
me and yelled for this old harpy [moadine couldnâ€™t hear him] and they
had me trussed up in no time. i believe alima could have done it alone,â€
 he added with reluctant admiration. â€œsheâ€™s as strong as a horse. and
of course a manâ€™s helpless when you hit him like that. no woman with a
shade of decency--â€

i had to grin at that, and even terry did, sourly. he wasnâ€™t given to
reasoning, but it did strike him that an assault like his rather waived
considerations of decency.

that man in herland.

i studied it awhile, thinking of the time theyâ€™d have if some of our
contagions got loose there, and concluded they were right. so i agreed.

terry was the obstacle. â€œindeed i wonâ€™t!â€ he protested. â€œthe first
thing iâ€™ll do is to get an expedition fixed up to force an entrance into
ma-land.â€

â€œthen,â€ they said quite calmly, â€œhe must remain an absolute prisoner,
always.â€

â€œanesthesia would be kinder,â€ urged moadine.

â€œand safer,â€ added zava.

â€œhe will promise, i think,â€ said ellador.

and he did. with which agreement we at last left herland.
