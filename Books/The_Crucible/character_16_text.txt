proctor, without conviction: they dismissed it. you heard her say - 
 
elizabeth: and what of tomorrow? she will cry me out until they take me! 
 
proctor: sit you down. 
 
elizabeth: she wants me dead, john, you know it! 
 
proctor: i say sit down! she sits, trembling. he speaks quietly, trying to keep his wits, now we 
must be wise, elizabeth. 
 
elizabeth, with sarcasm, and a sense of being lost: oh, indeed, indeed!

proctor: fear nothing. i’ll find ezekiel cheever. i’ll tell him she said it were all sport. 
 
elizabeth: john, with so many in the jail, more than cheever’s help is needed 
now, i think. would you favor me with this? go to abigail. 
 
proctor, his soul hardening as he senses... : what have i to say to abigail? 
 
elizabeth, delicately: john - grant me this. you have a faulty understanding of 
young girls. there is a promise made in any bed - 
 
proctor, striving against his anger: what promise!

money back. so my martha, she says to him, “walcott, if you haven’t the wit to 
feed  a  pig  properly,  you’ll  not  live  to  own  many,”  she  says.  now  he  goes  to 
court and claims that from that day to this he cannot keep a pig alive for more 
than four weeks because my martha bewitch them with her books! 
enter ezekiel cheever. a shocked silence. 
cheever: good evening to you, proctor. 
proctor: why, mr. cheever. good evening. 
cheever: good evening, all. good evening, mr. hale. 
proctor: i hope you come not on business of the court. 
 
cheever: i do, proctor, aye. i am clerk of the court. now, y’know.

judge hathorne enters. he is in his sixties, a bitter, remorseless salem judge. 
 
hathorne:  how  do  you  dare  come  roarin’ into  this  court!  are  you  gone  daft, 
corey? 
 
giles: you’re not a boston judge yet, hathorne. you’ll not call me daft! 
 
enter deputy governor danforth and, behind him, ezekiel cheever and parris. 
on his appearance, silence falls. danforth is a grave man in his sixties, of some 
humor and sophistication that does not, however, interfere with an exact loyalty 
to his position and his cause. he comes down to giles, who awaits his wrath. 
 
danforth, looking directly at giles: who is this man? 
 
parris: giles corey, sir, and a more contentious - 
 
giles, to parris: i am asked the question, and i am old enough to answer it! to
