Jocasta - 
                	Oedipus's
wife and mother, and Creon's sister. Jocasta appears only in the
final scenes of Oedipus the King. In her first
words, she attempts to make peace between Oedipus and Creon, pleading
with Oedipus not to banish Creon. She is comforting to her husband
and calmly tries to urge him to reject Tiresias's terrifying prophecies
as false. Jocasta solves the riddle of Oedipus's identity before
Oedipus does, and she expresses her love for her son and husband
in her desire to protect him from this knowledge.
