so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with. but of course i like
diana best and always will. i _adore_ diana. iâ€™m dreadfully far behind the
others. theyâ€™re all in the fifth book and iâ€™m only in the fourth. i feel
that itâ€™s kind of a disgrace. but thereâ€™s not one of them has such an
imagination as i have and i soon found that out. we had reading and
geography and canadian history and dictation today. mr. phillips said my
spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could
see it, all marked over. i felt so mortified, marilla; he might have
been politer to a stranger, i think. ruby gillis gave me an apple and
sophia sloane lent me a lovely pink card with â€˜may i see you home?â€™ on
it. iâ€™m to give it back to her tomorrow. and tillie boulter let me wear
her bead ring all the afternoon. can i have some of those pearl beads

four years ago his father was sick
and had to go out to alberta for his health and gilbert went with him.
they were there three years and gil didnâ€™t go to school hardly any
until they came back. you wonâ€™t find it so easy to keep head after this,
anne.â€

â€œiâ€™m glad,â€ said anne quickly. â€œi couldnâ€™t really feel proud of keeping
head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten. i got up yesterday
spelling â€˜ebullition.â€™ josie pye was head and, mind you, she peeped
in her book. mr. phillips didnâ€™t see her--he was looking at prissy
andrews--but i did. i just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she
got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.â€

â€œthose pye girls are cheats all round,â€ said diana indignantly, as they
climbed the fence of the main road. â€œgertie pye actually went and put
her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. did you ever? i

gilbert blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid
of ruby gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. he
was a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth
twisted into a teasing smile. presently ruby gillis started up to take
a sum to the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek,
believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots. everybody looked at
her and mr. phillips glared so sternly that ruby began to cry. gilbert
had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the
soberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at
anne and winked with inexpressible drollery.

â€œi think your gilbert blythe _is_ handsome,â€ confided anne to diana,
â€œbut i think heâ€™s very bold. it isnâ€™t good manners to wink at a strange
girl.â€

but it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.

mr. phillips was back in t

you mean, hateful boy!â€ she exclaimed passionately. â€œhow dare you!â€

and then--thwack! anne had brought her slate down on gilbertâ€™s head and
cracked it--slate not head--clear across.

avonlea school always enjoyed a scene. this was an especially enjoyable
one. everybody said â€œohâ€ in horrified delight. diana gasped. ruby
gillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. tommy
sloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared
open-mouthed at the tableau.

mr. phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on anneâ€™s
shoulder.

â€œanne shirley, what does this mean?â€ he said angrily. anne returned no
answer. it was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell
before the whole school that she had been called â€œcarrots.â€ gilbert it
was who spoke up stoutly.

â€œit was my fault mr. phillips. i teased her.â€

mr. phillips paid no heed to gilbert.

â€œi am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such
a vindictive spir

being a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts
of small imperfect mortals. â€œanne, go and stand on the platform in front
of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.â€

anne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under
which her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. with a white,
set face she obeyed. mr. phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the
blackboard above her head.

â€œann shirley has a very bad temper. ann shirley must learn to control
her temper,â€ and then read it out loud so that even the primer class,
who couldnâ€™t read writing, should understand it.

anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.
she did not cry or hang her head. anger was still too hot in her heart
for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. with
resentful eyes and passion

my feelings _excruciatingly_, diana.â€

it is possible the matter might have blown over without more
excruciation if nothing else had happened. but when things begin to
happen they are apt to keep on.

avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in mr. bellâ€™s spruce
grove over the hill and across his big pasture field. from there they
could keep an eye on eben wrightâ€™s house, where the master boarded. when
they saw mr. phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse;
but the distance being about three times longer than mr. wrightâ€™s lane
they were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three
minutes too late.

on the following day mr. phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic
fits of reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he should
expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned. anyone
who came in late would be punished.

all the boys and some of the girls

ter; and anne, who had not
been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the
grove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a
wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity
of the shadowy places, was latest of all. anne could run like a deer,
however; run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys
at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as mr.
phillips was in the act of hanging up his hat.

mr. phillipsâ€™s brief reforming energy was over; he didnâ€™t want the
bother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something
to save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it
in anne, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a
forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a
particularly rakish and disheveled appearance.

â€œanne shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boysâ€™ company we
shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,â€

 he said sarcastically.
â€œtake those flowers out of your hair and sit with gilbert blythe.â€

the other boys snickered. diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the
wreath from anneâ€™s hair and squeezed her hand. anne stared at the master
as if turned to stone.

â€œdid you hear what i said, anne?â€ queried mr. phillips sternly.

â€œyes, sir,â€ said anne slowly â€œbut i didnâ€™t suppose you really meant it.â€

â€œi assure you i didâ€--still with the sarcastic inflection which all the
children, and anne especially, hated. it flicked on the raw. â€œobey me at
once.â€

for a moment anne looked as if she meant to disobey. then, realizing
that there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the
aisle, sat down beside gilbert blythe, and buried her face in her arms
on the desk. ruby gillis, who got

that that boy should
be gilbert blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly
unbearable. anne felt that she could not bear it and it would be of
no use to try. her whole being seethed with shame and anger and
humiliation.

at first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged.
but as anne never lifted her head and as gilbert worked fractions as if
his whole soul was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned
to their own tasks and anne was forgotten. when mr. phillips called the
history class out anne should have gone, but anne did not move, and
mr. phillips, who had been writing some verses â€œto priscillaâ€ before he
called the class, was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never
missed her. once, when nobody was looking, gilbert took from his desk
a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, â€œyou are sweet,â€ and
slipped it under the curve of anneâ€™s arm. whereupon anne arose, took the
pink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers

those things home for, anne?â€ diana wanted to
know, as soon as they were out on the road. she had not dared to ask the
question before.

â€œi am not coming back to school any more,â€ said anne. diana gasped and
stared at anne to see if she meant it.

â€œwill marilla let you stay home?â€ she asked.

â€œsheâ€™ll have to,â€ said anne. â€œiâ€™ll _never_ go to school to that man
again.â€

â€œoh, anne!â€ diana looked as if she were ready to cry. â€œi do think youâ€™re
mean. what shall i do? mr. phillips will make me sit with that horrid
gertie pye--i know he will because she is sitting alone. do come back,
anne.â€

â€œiâ€™d do almost anything in the world for you, diana,â€ said anne sadly.
â€œiâ€™d let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. but
i canâ€™t do this, so please donâ€™t ask it. you harrow up my very soul.â€

â€œjust think of all the fun you will miss,â€ mourned diana. â€œwe are going
to build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and weâ€™ll be playing

all next week and youâ€™ve never played ball, anne. itâ€™s tremendously
exciting. and weâ€™re going to learn a new song--jane andrews is
practicing it up now; and alice andrews is going to bring a new pansy
book next week and weâ€™re all going to read it out loud, chapter about,
down by the brook. and you know you are so fond of reading out loud,
anne.â€

nothing moved anne in the least. her mind was made up. she would not go
to school to mr. phillips again; she told marilla so when she got home.

â€œnonsense,â€ said marilla.

â€œit isnâ€™t nonsense at all,â€ said anne, gazing at marilla with solemn,
reproachful eyes. â€œdonâ€™t you understand, marilla? iâ€™ve been insulted.â€

â€œinsulted fiddlesticks! youâ€™ll go to school tomorrow as usual.â€

â€œoh, no.â€ anne shook her head gently. â€œiâ€™m not going back, marilla. iâ€™ll
learn my lessons at home and iâ€™ll be as good as i can be and hold my
tongue all the time if itâ€™s possible a

marilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking
out of anneâ€™s small face. she understood that she would have trouble in
overcoming it; but she re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then.
â€œiâ€™ll run down and see rachel about it this evening,â€ she thought.
â€œthereâ€™s no use reasoning with anne now. sheâ€™s too worked up and iâ€™ve
an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion. far as i can
make out from her story, mr. phillips has been carrying matters with a
rather high hand. but it would never do to say so to her. iâ€™ll just talk
it over with rachel. sheâ€™s sent ten children to school and she ought to
know something about it. sheâ€™ll have heard the whole story, too, by this
time.â€

marilla found mrs. lynde knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully
as usual.

â€œi suppose you know what iâ€™ve come about,â€ she said, a little
shamefacedly.

mrs. rachel nodded.

wonâ€™t go back to school. i never saw a child so worked up. iâ€™ve been
expecting trouble ever since she started to school. i knew things were
going too smooth to last. sheâ€™s so high strung. what would you advise,
rachel?â€

â€œwell, since youâ€™ve asked my advice, marilla,â€ said mrs. lynde
amiably--mrs. lynde dearly loved to be asked for advice--â€œiâ€™d just
humor her a little at first, thatâ€™s what iâ€™d do. itâ€™s my belief that
mr. phillips was in the wrong. of course, it doesnâ€™t do to say so to the
children, you know. and of course he did right to punish her yesterday
for giving way to temper. but today it was different. the others who
were late should have been punished as well as anne, thatâ€™s what. and i
donâ€™t believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. it
isnâ€™t modest. tillie boulter was real indignant. she took anneâ€™s part
right through and said all the scholars did too. anne seems real popular

amazement.

â€œyes. that is i wouldnâ€™t say school to her again until she said it
herself. depend upon it, marilla, sheâ€™ll cool off in a week or so and
be ready enough to go back of her own accord, thatâ€™s what, while, if
you were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum
sheâ€™d take next and make more trouble than ever. the less fuss made the
better, in my opinion. she wonâ€™t miss much by not going to school, as
far as _that_ goes. mr. phillips isnâ€™t any good at all as a teacher. the
order he keeps is scandalous, thatâ€™s what, and he neglects the young
fry and puts all his time on those big scholars heâ€™s getting ready for
queenâ€™s. heâ€™d never have got the school for another year if his uncle
hadnâ€™t been a trustee--_the_ trustee, for he just leads the other two
around by the nose, thatâ€™s what. i declare, i donâ€™t know what education
in this island is coming to.â€

mrs. rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were

creek gave her. you had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw
it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the
warts would all go. charlie sloaneâ€™s name was written up with em whiteâ€™s

one of his children again; and mattie andrews had a new red hood and a
blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were
perfectly sickening; and lizzie wright didnâ€™t speak to mamie wilson
because mamie wilsonâ€™s grown-up sister had cut out lizzie wrightâ€™s

â€œyouâ€™d better muse over your lessons and sums,â€ said marilla, concealing
her delight at this development of the situation. â€œif youâ€™re going back
to school i hope weâ€™ll hear no more of breaking slates over peopleâ€™s
heads and such carryings on. behave yourself and do just what your
teacher tells you.â€

â€œiâ€™ll try to be a model pupil,â€ agreed anne dolefully. â€œthere wonâ€™t be
much fun in it, i expect. mr. phillips said minnie andrews was a model
pupil and there isnâ€™t a spark of imagination or life in her. she is
just dull and poky and never seems to have a good time. but i feel so
depressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now. iâ€™m going round by
the road. i couldnâ€™t bear to go by the birch path all alone. i should
weep bitter tears if i did.â€

anne was welcomed back to school with open arms. her imagination had

ability in

the girls were not the only scholars who â€œappreciatedâ€ her. when anne
went to her seat after dinner hour--she had been told by mr. phillips to
sit with the model minnie andrews--she found on her desk a big luscious
â€œstrawberry apple.â€ anne caught it up all ready to take a bite when she
remembered that the only place in avonlea where strawberry apples grew
was in the old blythe orchard on the other side of the lake of shining
waters. anne dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and
ostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief. the apple lay
untouched on her desk until the next morning, when little timothy
andrews,

he fire, annexed it as one
of his perquisites. charlie sloaneâ€™s slate pencil, gorgeously bedizened
with striped red and yellow paper, costing two cents where ordinary
pencils cost only one, which he sent up to her after dinner hour, met
with a more favorable reception. anne was graciously pleased to accept
it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated
youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to
make such fearful errors in his dictation that mr. phillips kept him in
after school to rewrite it.

but as,

so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from diana barry who
was sitting with gertie pye embittered anneâ€™s little triumph.

â€œdiana might just have smiled at me once, i think,â€ she mourned to
marilla that night. but the next morning a note most fearfully and
wonderfully twisted and folded, and a small parcel were passed across to

marilla pessimistically expected more trouble since anne had again begun
to go to school. but none developed. perhaps anne caught something of
the â€œmodelâ€ spirit from minnie andrews; at least she got on very well
with mr. phillips thenceforth. she flung herself into her studies heart
and soul, determined not to be outdone in any class by gilbert blythe.
the rivalry between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured
on gilbertâ€™s side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing
cannot be said of anne, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for
holding grudges. she was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves. she
would not stoop to admit that she meant to rival gilbert in schoolwork,

tten up together. it was almost as bad
as a take-notice and anneâ€™s mortification was as evident as gilbertâ€™s
satisfaction. when the written examinations at the end of each month
were held the suspense was terrible. the first month gilbert came out
three marks ahead. the second anne beat him by five. but her triumph was
marred by the fact that gilbert congratulated her heartily before the
whole school. it would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had
felt the sting of his defeat.

mr. phillips might not be a very good teacher; but a pupil so inflexibly
determined on learning as anne was could hardly escape making progress
under any kind of teacher. by the end of the term anne and gilbert were
both promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the
elements of â€œthe branchesâ€--by which latin, geometry, french, and
algebra were meant. in geometry anne met her waterloo.

â€œeven diana gets along better than i do. but i donâ€™t mind being beaten

casting a cloud over my whole life. iâ€™m such a dunce at it, matthew.â€

anne was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in
school. gilbert blythe spelled her down in class and left her clear out
of sight in mental arithmetic. anneâ€™s consequent humiliation was
less than it might have been, however, in view of the concert and the
spare-room bed. she and diana talked so constantly about it all day that
with a stricter teacher than mr. phillips dire disgrace must inevitably
have been their portion.

anne felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going
to the concert, for nothing else was discussed that day in school. the
avonlea debating club, which met fortnightly all winter, had had several
smaller free entertainments; but this was to be a big affair, admission
ten cents, in aid of the library. the avonlea young people had been
practicing for weeks, and all the scholars were especially interested in

until people sitting near her laughed too, more out of sympathy with her
than with amusement at a selection that was rather threadbare even in
avonlea; and when mr. phillips gave mark antonyâ€™s oration over the
dead body of caesar in the most heart-stirring tones--looking at prissy
andrews at the end of every sentence--anne felt that she could rise and
mutiny on the spot if but one roman citizen led the way.

only one number on the program failed to interest her. when gilbert

|dear me, there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as
mrs. lynde says,â€ remarked anne plaintively, putting her slate and books
down on the kitchen table on the last day of june and wiping her red

i took an extra handkerchief to school today? i had a presentiment that
it would be needed.â€

â€œi never thought you were so fond of mr. phillips that youâ€™d require two
handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away,â€ said
marilla.

â€œi donâ€™t think i was crying because i was really so very fond of him,â€
 reflected anne. â€œi just cried because all the others did. it was

phillips, but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she

â€œit does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesnâ€™t it?â€ she said
