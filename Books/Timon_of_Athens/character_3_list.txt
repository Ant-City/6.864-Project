Flavius - 
      
        One of Timon's servants, Flavius is terrified to talk to Timon about his finances because Timon refuses to listen to him. Timon has not only run out of money, but he has gone into debt in order to continue giving gifts to his friends, and all his land is mortgaged. Finally Flavius has to confront Timon with the facts. When Timon is unable to procure a loan from his friends, he leaves Athens, and Flavius and his other servants mourn the fall of such a good man, brought down by his own generosity. Flavius shares out his last cash among the remaining servants, and determines to continue to serve Timon, going into the wilderness after him. Upon finding Timon, he offers his last remaining gold and weeps at Timon's downfall. Astonished, Timon declares Flavius is the only honorable man he knew in Athens, the only man who escapes his cursings of mankind, and gives him a sum of gold as a reward.
