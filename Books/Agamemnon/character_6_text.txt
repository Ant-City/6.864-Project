a fire-god, from mount ida scattering flame.
whence starting, beacon after beacon burst
in flaming message hitherward. ida first
told hermes' lemnian rock, whose answering sign
was caught by towering athos, the divine,
with pines immense--yea, fishes of the night
swam skyward, drunken with that leaping light,
which swelled like some strange sun, till dim and far
makistos' watchmen marked a glimmering star;

modern theatre. a space of some days is assumed to have passed and we find
the elders again assembled_.

leader.

soon surely shall we read the message right;
were fire and beacon-call and lamps of light
true speakers, or but happy lights, that seem
and are not, like sweet voices in a dream.
i see a herald yonder by the shore,
shadowed with olive sprays. and from his sore
rent raiment cries a witness from afar,
dry dust, born brother to the mire of war,
that mute he comes not, neither through the smoke
of mountain forests shall his tale be spoke;
but either shouting for a joyful day,
or else.... but other thoughts i cast away.
as good hath dawned, may good shine on, we pray!

--and whoso for this city prayeth aught
  else, let him reap the harvest of his thought!

p. 21, l. 487.]--this break in the action, covering a space of several
days, was first pointed out by dr. walter headlam. incidentally it removes
the gravest of the difficulties raised by dr. verrall in his famous essay
upon the plot of the _agamemnon_.

p. 21, l. 495, dry dust, own brother to the mire of war.]--i.e. "i can see
by the state of his clothes, caked with dry dust which was once the mire
of battle, that he comes straight from the war and can speak with
knowledge." the herald is probably (though perhaps not quite consistently)
conceived as having rushed post-haste with his news.

pp. 22 ff., herald.]--the herald bursts in overcome with excitement and
delight, full of love for his home and everything he sees. a marked
contrast to agamemnon, ll. 810 ff. note that his first speech confirms all
the worst fears suggested by clytemnestra. agamemnon has committed all the
sins she prayed against, and more. the terrible lines 527 ff., "till her
gods' houses, etc.," are very

like a passage in the _persae_, 811 ff.,
where exactly the same acts by the persian invaders of greece make their
future punishment inevitable.

p. 22, l. 509, pythian lord.]--apollo is often a sinister figure in
tragedy. cf. sophocles _oedipus_ , ll. 915 ff., pp. 52 ff., and the
similar scene, _electra_, 655 ff. here it is a shock to the herald to come
suddenly on the god who was the chief enemy of the greeks at troy. one
feels apollo an evil presence also in the cassandra scene, 11. 1071 ff.,
pp. 47 ff.

p. 23, l. 530, happy among men.]--the crown of his triumph! early greek
thought was always asking the question, what is human happiness? to the
herald agamemnon has achieved happiness if any one ever did. cf. the
well-known story of croesus asking solon who was the happiest man in the
world (herodotus, i. 30-33).

p. 24, ll. 551 ff.,

 herald's second speech.]--the connexion of thought is:
"after all, why should either of us wish to die? all has ended well." this
vivid description of the actualities of war can be better appreciated now
than it could in 1913.

p. 25, l. 577, these spoils.]--spoils purporting to come from the trojan
war were extant in greek temples in aeschylus' day and later.

p. 26, l. 595, our women's joy-cry.]--there seems to have been in argos an
old popular festival, celebrating with joy or mockery the supposed

p. 29, chorus. the name helena.]--there was a controversy in aeschylus'
day whether language, including names, was a matter of convention or of
nature. was it mere accident, and could you change the name of anything at
will? or was language a thing rooted in nature and fixed by god from of
old? aeschylus adopts the latter view: why was this being called helena?
if one had understood god's purpose one would have seen it was because she
really _was_ "helenâs"--_ship-destroyer_. (the herald's story of the
shipwreck has suggested this particular idea.) similarly, if a hero was
called aias, and came to great sorrow, one could see that he was so called
from 'aiai,' "alas!"--the antistrophe seems to find a meaning in the name
paris or alexandras, where the etymology is not so clear.

pp. 33 ff.]--entrance of agamemnon. the metre of the chorus indicates
marching; so that apparently the procession takes some time to move across
the orchestra and get into position. cassandra would be dre

ssed, as a
prophetess, in a robe of white reaching to the feet, covered by an
_agrênon_, or net of wool with large meshes; she would have a staff and
certain fillets or crowns. the leader welcomes the king: he explains that,
though he was against the war ten years ago, and has not changed his
opinion, he is a faithful servant of the king ... and that not all are
equally so. he gave a similar hint to the herald above, ll. 546-550, p.
24.

p. 35, agamemnon.]--a hard, cold speech, full of pride in the earlier
part, and turning to ominous threats at the end. those who have dared to
be false shall be broken.--at the end comes a note of fear, like the fear
in shakespeare's julius caesar. he is so full of triumph and success; he
must be very careful not to provoke a fall.--victory, nike, was to the
greeks a very vivid and infectious thing. it clung to you or it deserted
you. and one who was really charged w
