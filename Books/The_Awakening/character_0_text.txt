m. there were only creoles that summer at lebrun’s.
they all knew each other, and felt like one large family, among
whom existed the most amicable relations. a characteristic which
distinguished them and which impressed mrs. pontellier most forcibly
was their entire absence of prudery. their freedom of expression was
at first incomprehensible to her, though she had no difficulty in
reconciling it with a lofty chastity which in the creole woman seems to
be inborn and unmistakable.

never would edna pontellier forget the shock with which she heard madame
ratignolle relating to old monsieur farival the harrowing story of one
of her accouchements, withholding no intimate detail. she was growing
accustomed to like shocks, but she could not keep the mounting color
back from her cheeks. oftener than once her coming had interrupted the
droll story with which robert was entertaining some amused group of
married women.

a book had gone the rounds of the pension. when it came her turn to read
it, she did so w

ance wandered from his face away toward the gulf, whose
sonorous murmur reached her like a loving but imperative entreaty.

“oh, come!” he insisted. “you mustn’t miss your bath. come on. the water
must be delicious; it will not hurt you. come.”

he reached up for her big, rough straw hat that hung on a peg outside
the door, and put it on her head. they descended the steps, and walked
away together toward the beach. the sun was low in the west and the
breeze was soft and warm.

edna pontellier could not have told why, wishing to go to the beach with
robert, she should in the first place have declined, and in the second
place have followed in obedience to one of the two contradictory
impulses which impelled her.

a certain light was beginning to dawn dimly within her,--the light
which, showing the way, forbids it.

at that early period it served but to bewilder her. it moved her to
dreams, to thoughtfulness, to the shadowy anguish which had overcome her
the midnight when she had aband

of a long, sandy path, upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that
bordered it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads. there
were acres of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand. further away
still, vegetable gardens abounded, with frequent small plantations of
orange or lemon trees intervening. the dark green clusters glistened
from afar in the sun.

the women were both of goodly height, madame ratignolle possessing
the more feminine and matronly figure. the charm of edna pontellier’s
physique stole insensibly upon you. the lines of her body were long,
clean and symmetrical; it was a body which occasionally fell into
splendid poses; there was no suggestion of the trim, stereotyped
fashion-plate about it. a casual and indiscriminating observer, in
passing, might not cast a second glance upon the figure. but with more
feeling and discernment he would have recognized the noble beauty of its
modeling, and the graceful severity of poise and movement, which made

he water into froth. it fluttered the
skirts of the two women and kept them for a while engaged in adjusting,
readjusting, tucking in, securing hair-pins and hat-pins. a few persons
were sporting some distance away in the water. the beach was very still
of human sound at that hour. the lady in black was reading her morning
devotions on the porch of a neighboring bathhouse. two young lovers were
exchanging their hearts’ yearnings beneath the children’s tent, which
they had found unoccupied.

edna pontellier, casting her eyes about, had finally kept them at rest
upon the sea. the day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the
blue sky went; there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the
horizon. a lateen sail was visible in the direction of cat island, and
others to the south seemed almost motionless in the far distance.

“of whom--of what are you thinking?” asked adele of her companion,
whose countenance she had been watching with a little amused attention,
arrested by the absorbe
