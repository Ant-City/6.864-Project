[CHARACTER]  - 
      throughout most of the novel, venn works as a semi-nomadic "reddleman": he travels throughout the region selling the dye that farmers use to mark their sheep. as a consequence of his exposure to the dye, his entire body and everything he owns are dyed red. entirely red, camping out on the heath in his wagon, and emerging mysteriously from time to time, venn functions as an image of the heath incarnated. he watches over thomasin yeobright's interests throughout the novel, but also preserves his own interests: he has long been in love with her, and at the end of the novel they marry. venn is very clever and insightful, and can be a devious schemer.
