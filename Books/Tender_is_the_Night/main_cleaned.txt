i
on the pleasant shore of the french riviera, about half
way between marseilles and the italian border, stands a
large, proud, rosecolored hotel. deferential palms cool
its flushed façade, and before it stretches a short dazzling
beach. lately it has become a summer resort of notable and
fashionable people; a decade ago it was almost deserted after
its english clientele went north in april. now, many bungalows
cluster near it, but when this story begins only the
cupolas of a dozen old villas rotted like water lilies among
the massed pines between gausse’s hôtel des étrangers and
cannes, five miles away.
the hotel and its bright tan prayer rug of a beach were
one. in the early morning the distant image of cannes, the
pink and cream of old fortifications, the purple alp that
bounded italy, were cast across the water and lay quavering
in the ripples and rings sent up by sea-plants through the
clear shallows. before eight a man came down to the beach
in a blue bathrobe and with much preliminary application
to his person of the chilly water, and much grunting and
loud breathing, floundered a minute in the sea. when he
had gone, beach and bay were quiet for an hour. merchantmen
crawled westward on the horizon; bus boys shouted
in the hotel court; the dew dried upon the pines. in another
hour the horns of motors began to blow down from the 
6 tender is the night
winding road along the low range of the maures, which separates
the littoral from true provençal france.
a mile from the sea, where pines give way to dusty poplars,
is an isolated railroad stop, whence one june morning
in 1925 a victoria brought a woman and her daughter down
to gausse’s hotel. the mother’s face was of a fading prettiness
that would soon be patted with broken veins; her
expression was both tranquil and aware in a pleasant way.
however, one’s eye moved on quickly to her daughter, who
had magic in her pink palms and her cheeks lit to a lovely
flame, like the thrilling flush of children after their cold
baths in the evening. her fine forehead sloped gently up to
where her hair, bordering it like an armorial shield, burst
into lovelocks and waves and curlicues of ash blonde and
gold. her eyes were bright, big, clear, wet, and shining, the
color of her cheeks was real, breaking close to the surface
from the strong young pump of her heart. her body hovered
delicately on the last edge of childhood—she was almost
eighteen, nearly complete, but the dew was still on her.
as sea and sky appeared below them in a thin, hot line
the mother said:
‘something tells me we’re not going to like this place.’
‘i want to go home anyhow,’ the girl answered.
they both spoke cheerfully but were obviously without
direction and bored by the fact—moreover, just any direction
would not do. they wanted high excitement, not from
the necessity of stimulating jaded nerves but with the avidity
of prize-winning schoolchildren who deserved their
vacations.

‘we’ll stay three days and then go home. i’ll wire right
away for steamer tickets.’
at the hotel the girl made the reservation in idiomatic but
rather flat french, like something remembered. when they
were installed on the ground floor she walked into the glare
of the french windows and out a few steps onto the stone
veranda that ran the length of the hotel. when she walked
she carried herself like a balletdancer, not slumped down
on her hips but held up in the small of her back. out there
the hot light clipped close her shadow and she retreated—it
was too bright to see. fifty yards away the mediterranean
yielded up its pigments, moment by moment, to the brutal
sunshine; below the balustrade a faded buick cooked on the
hotel drive.
indeed, of all the region only the beach stirred with activity.
three british nannies sat knitting the slow pattern of
victorian england, the pattern of the forties, the sixties, and
the eighties, into sweaters and socks, to the tune of gossip as
formalized as incantation; closer to the sea a dozen persons
kept house under striped umbrellas, while their dozen children
pursued unintimidated fish through the shallows or
lay naked and glistening with cocoanut oil out in the sun.
as rosemary came onto the beach a boy of twelve ran
past her and dashed into the sea with exultant cries. feeling
the impactive scrutiny of strange faces, she took off her
bathrobe and followed. she floated face down for a few yards
and finding it shallow staggered to her feet and plodded forward,
dragging slim legs like weights against the resistance
of the water. when it was about breast high, she glanced 
8 tender is the night
back toward shore: a bald man in a monocle and a pair of
tights, his tufted chest thrown out, his brash navel sucked
in, was regarding her attentively. as rosemary returned the
gaze the man dislodged the monocle, which went into hiding
amid the facetious whiskers of his chest, and poured
himself a glass of something from a bottle in his hand.
rosemary laid her face on the water and swam a choppy
little fourbeat crawl out to the raft. the water reached up for
her, pulled her down tenderly out of the heat, seeped in her
hair and ran into the corners of her body. she turned round
and round in it, embracing it, wallowing in it. reaching the
raft she was out of breath, but a tanned woman with very
white teeth looked down at her, and rosemary, suddenly
conscious of the raw whiteness of her own body, turned on
her back and drifted toward shore. the hairy man holding
the bottle spoke to her as she came out.
‘i say—they have sharks out behind the raft.’ he was of
indeterminate nationality, but spoke english with a slow
oxford drawl. ‘yesterday they devoured two british sailors
from the flotte at golfe juan.’
‘heavens!’ exclaimed rosemary.
‘they come in for the refuse from the flotte.’
glazing his eyes to indicate that he had only spoken in
order to warn her, he minced off two steps and poured himself
another drink.
not unpleasantly self-conscious, since there had been
a slight sway of attention toward her during this conversation,
rosemary looked for a place to sit. obviously each
family possessed the strip of sand immediately in front of its 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 9
umbrella; besides there was much visiting and talking back
and forth—the atmosphere of a community upon which it
would be presumptuous to intrude. farther up, where the
beach was strewn with pebbles and dead sea-weed, sat a
group with flesh as white as her own. they lay under small
hand-parasols instead of beach umbrellas and were obviously
less indigenous to the place. between the dark people
and the light, rosemary found room and spread out her peignoir
on the sand.
lying so, she first heard their voices and felt their feet
skirt her body and their shapes pass between the sun and
herself. the breath of an inquisitive dog blew warm and nervous
on her neck; she could feel her skin broiling a little in
the heat and hear the small exhausted wa-waa of the expiring
waves. presently her ear distinguished individual voices
and she became aware that some one referred to scornfully
as ‘that north guy’ had kidnapped a waiter from a café in
cannes last night in order to saw him in two. the sponsor of
the story was a white-haired woman in full evening dress,
obviously a relic of the previous evening, for a tiara still
clung to her head and a discouraged orchid expired from
her shoulder. rosemary, forming a vague antipathy to her
and her companions, turned away.
nearest her, on the other side, a young woman lay under
a roof of umbrellas making out a list of things from a
book open on the sand. her bathing suit was pulled off her
shoulders and her back, a ruddy, orange brown, set off by a
string of creamy pearls, shone in the sun. her face was hard
and lovely and pitiful. her eyes met rosemary’s but did not 
10 tender is the night
see her. beyond her was a fine man in a jockey cap and redstriped
tights; then the woman rosemary had seen on the
raft, and who looked back at her, seeing her; then a man
with a long face and a golden, leonine head, with blue tights
and no hat, talking very seriously to an unmistakably latin
young man in black tights, both of them picking at little
pieces of seaweed in the sand. she thought they were mostly
americans, but something made them unlike the americans
she had known of late.
after a while she realized that the man in the jockey
cap was giving a quiet little performance for this group; he
moved gravely about with a rake, ostensibly removing gravel
and meanwhile developing some esoteric burlesque held
in suspension by his grave face. its faintest ramification had
become hilarious, until whatever he said released a burst of
laughter. even those who, like herself, were too far away to
hear, sent out antennæ of attention until the only person on
the beach not caught up in it was the young woman with
the string of pearls. perhaps from modesty of possession she
responded to each salvo of amusement by bending closer
over her list.
the man of the monocle and bottle spoke suddenly out
of the sky above rosemary.
‘you are a ripping swimmer.’
she demurred.
‘jolly good. my name is campion. here is a lady who says
she saw you in sorrento last week and knows who you are
and would so like to meet you.’
glancing around with concealed annoyance rosemary 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 11
saw the untanned people were waiting. reluctantly she got
up and went over to them.
‘mrs. abrams—mrs. mckisco—mr. mckisco—mr.
dumphry—
‘we know who you are,’ spoke up the woman in evening
dress. ‘you’re rosemary hoyt and i recognized you in
sorrento and asked the hotel clerk and we all think you’re
perfectly marvellous and we want to know why you’re not
back in america making another marvellous moving picture.’
they made a superfluous gesture of moving over for her.
the woman who had recognized her was not a jewess, despite
her name. she was one of those elderly ‘good sports’
preserved by an imperviousness to experience and a good
digestion into another generation.
‘we wanted to warn you about getting burned the first
day,’ she continued cheerily, ‘because your skin is important,
but there seems to be so darn much formality on this
beach that we didn’t know whether you’d mind.’
12 tender is the night
ii
‘we thought maybe you were in the plot,’ said mrs.
mckisco. she was a shabby-eyed, pretty young woman with
a disheartening intensity. ‘we don’t know who’s in the plot
and who isn’t. one man my husband had been particularly
nice to turned out to be a chief character—practically the
assistant hero.’
‘the plot?’ inquired rosemary, half understanding. ‘is
there a plot?’
‘my dear, we don’t know,’ said mrs. abrams, with a
convulsive, stout woman’s chuckle. ‘we’re not in it. we’re
the gallery.’
mr. dumphry, a tow-headed effeminate young man, remarked:
‘mama abrams is a plot in herself,’ and campion
shook his monocle at him, saying: ‘now, royal, don’t be too
ghastly for words.’ rosemary looked at them all uncomfortably,
wishing her mother had come down here with her.
she did not like these people, especially in her immediate
comparison of them with those who had interested her at
the other end of the beach. her mother’s modest but compact
social gift got them out of unwelcome situations swiftly
and firmly. but rosemary had been a celebrity for only six
months, and sometimes the french manners of her early
adolescence and the democratic manners of america, these
latter superimposed, made a certain confusion and let her 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 13
in for just such things.
mr. mckisco, a scrawny, freckle-and-red man of thirty,
did not find the topic of the ‘plot’ amusing. he had been
staring at the sea— now after a swift glance at his wife he
turned to rosemary and demanded aggressively:
‘been here long?’
‘only a day.’
‘oh.’
evidently feeling that the subject had been thoroughly
changed, he looked in turn at the others.
‘going to stay all summer?’ asked mrs. mckisco, innocently.
‘if you do you can watch the plot unfold.’
‘for god’s sake, violet, drop the subject!’ exploded her
husband. ‘get a new joke, for god’s sake!’
mrs. mckisco swayed toward mrs. abrams and breathed
audibly:
‘he’s nervous.’
‘i’m not nervous,’ disagreed mckisco. ‘it just happens
i’m not nervous at all.’
he was burning visibly—a grayish flush had spread over
his face, dissolving all his expressions into a vast ineffectuality.
suddenly remotely conscious of his condition he got
up to go in the water, followed by his wife, and seizing the
opportunity rosemary followed.
mr. mckisco drew a long breath, flung himself into the
shallows and began a stiff-armed batting of the mediterranean,
obviously intended to suggest a crawl—his breath
exhausted he arose and looked around with an expression
of surprise that he was still in sight of shore.
14 tender is the night
‘i haven’t learned to breathe yet. i never quite understood
how they breathed.’ he looked at rosemary inquiringly.
‘i think you breathe out under water,’ she explained. ‘and
every fourth beat you roll your head over for air.’
‘the breathing’s the hardest part for me. shall we go to
the raft?’
the man with the leonine head lay stretched out upon
the raft, which tipped back and forth with the motion of the
water. as mrs. mckisco reached for it a sudden tilt struck
her arm up roughly, whereupon the man started up and
pulled her on board.
‘i was afraid it hit you.’ his voice was slow and shy; he
had one of the saddest faces rosemary had ever seen, the
high cheekbones of an indian, a long upper lip, and enormous
deep-set dark golden eyes. he had spoken out of the
side of his mouth, as if he hoped his words would reach mrs.
mckisco by a circuitous and unobtrusive route; in a minute
he had shoved off into the water and his long body lay motionless
toward shore.
rosemary and mrs. mckisco watched him. when he
had exhausted his momentum he abruptly bent double, his
thin thighs rose above the surface, and he disappeared totally,
leaving scarcely a fleck of foam behind.
‘he’s a good swimmer,’ rosemary said.
mrs. mckisco’s answer came with surprising violence.
‘well, he’s a rotten musician.’ she turned to her husband,
who after two unsuccessful attempts had managed to climb
on the raft, and having attained his balance was trying to
make some kind of compensatory flourish, achieving only 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 15
an extra stagger. ‘i was just saying that abe north may be a
good swimmer but he’s a rotten musician.’
‘yes,’ agreed mckisco, grudgingly. obviously he had created
his wife’s world, and allowed her few liberties in it.
‘antheil’s my man.’ mrs. mckisco turned challengingly
to rosemary, ‘anthiel and joyce. i don’t suppose you ever
hear much about those sort of people in hollywood, but my
husband wrote the first criticism of ulysses that ever appeared
in america.’
‘i wish i had a cigarette,’ said mckisco calmly. ‘that’s
more important to me just now.’
‘he’s got insides—don’t you think so, albert?’
her voice faded off suddenly. the woman of the pearls
had joined her two children in the water, and now abe
north came up under one of them like a volcanic island,
raising him on his shoulders. the child yelled with fear and
delight and the woman watched with a lovely peace, without
a smile.
‘is that his wife?’ rosemary asked.
‘no, that’s mrs. diver. they’re not at the hotel.’ her eyes,
photographic, did not move from the woman’s face. after a
moment she turned vehemently to rosemary.
‘have you been abroad before?’
‘yes—i went to school in paris.’
‘oh! well then you probably know that if you want to enjoy
yourself here the thing is to get to know some real french
families. what do these people get out of it?’ she pointed
her left shoulder toward shore. ‘they just stick around with
each other in little cliques. of course, we had letters of in-
16 tender is the night
troduction and met all the best french artists and writers in
paris. that made it very nice.’
‘i should think so.’
‘my husband is finishing his first novel, you see.’
rosemary said: ‘oh, he is?’ she was not thinking anything
special, except wondering whether her mother had
got to sleep in this heat.
‘it’s on the idea of ulysses,’ continued mrs. mckisco.
‘only instead of taking twenty-four hours my husband takes
a hundred years. he takes a decayed old french aristocrat
and puts him in contrast with the mechanical age—‘
‘oh, for god’s sake, violet, don’t go telling everybody the
idea,’ protested mckisco. ‘i don’t want it to get all around
before the book’s published.’
rosemary swam back to the shore, where she threw
her peignoir over her already sore shoulders and lay down
again in the sun. the man with the jockey cap was now going
from umbrella to umbrella carrying a bottle and little
glasses in his hands; presently he and his friends grew livelier
and closer together and now they were all under a single
assemblage of umbrellas—she gathered that some one was
leaving and that this was a last drink on the beach. even the
children knew that excitement was generating under that
umbrella and turned toward it—and it seemed to rosemary
that it all came from the man in the jockey cap.
noon dominated sea and sky—even the white line of
cannes, five miles off, had faded to a mirage of what was
fresh and cool; a robin-breasted sailing boat pulled in behind
it a strand from the outer, darker sea. it seemed that 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 17
there was no life anywhere in all this expanse of coast except
under the filtered sunlight of those umbrellas, where
something went on amid the color and the murmur.
campion walked near her, stood a few feet away and
rosemary closed her eyes, pretending to be asleep; then
she half-opened them and watched two dim, blurred pillars
that were legs. the man tried to edge his way into a sandcolored
cloud, but the cloud floated off into the vast hot sky.
rosemary fell really asleep.
she awoke drenched with sweat to find the beach deserted
save for the man in the jockey cap, who was folding a last
umbrella. as rosemary lay blinking, he walked nearer and
said:
‘i was going to wake you before i left. it’s not good to get
too burned right away.’
‘thank you.’ rosemary looked down at her crimson
legs.
‘heavens!’
she laughed cheerfully, inviting him to talk, but dick
diver was already carrying a tent and a beach umbrella up
to a waiting car, so she went into the water to wash off the
sweat. he came back and gathering up a rake, a shovel, and
a sieve, stowed them in a crevice of a rock. he glanced up
and down the beach to see if he had left anything.
‘do you know what time it is?’ rosemary asked.
‘it’s about half-past one.’
they faced the seascape together momentarily.
‘it’s not a bad time,’ said dick diver. ‘it’s not one of worst
times of the day.’
18 tender is the night
he looked at her and for a moment she lived in the bright
blue worlds of his eyes, eagerly and confidently. then he
shouldered his last piece of junk and went up to his car, and
rosemary came out of the water, shook out her peignoir and
walked up to the hotel.

it was almost two when they went into the dining-room.
back and forth over the deserted tables a heavy pattern of
beams and shadows swayed with the motion of the pines
outside. two waiters, piling plates and talking loud italian,
fell silent when they came in and brought them a tired version
of the table d’hôte luncheon.
‘i fell in love on the beach,’ said rosemary.
‘who with?’
‘first with a whole lot of people who looked nice. then
with one man.’
‘did you talk to him?’
‘just a little. very handsome. with reddish hair.’ she was
eating, ravenously. ‘he’s married though—it’s usually the
way.’
her mother was her best friend and had put every last
possibility into the guiding of her, not so rare a thing in
the theatrical profession, but rather special in that mrs. elsie
speers was not recompensing herself for a defeat of her
own. she had no personal bitterness or resentments about
life—twice satisfactorily married and twice widowed, her
cheerful stoicism had each time deepened. one of her husbands
had been a cavalry officer and one an army doctor,
and they both left something to her that she tried to present
intact to rosemary. by not sparing rosemary she had 
20 tender is the night
made her hard—by not sparing her own labor and devotion
she had cultivated an idealism in rosemary, which at present
was directed toward herself and saw the world through
her eyes. so that while rosemary was a ‘simple’ child she
was protected by a double sheath of her mother’s armor and
her own—she had a mature distrust of the trivial, the facile
and the vulgar. however, with rosemary’s sudden success
in pictures mrs. speers felt that it was time she were spiritually
weaned; it would please rather than pain her if this
somewhat bouncing, breathless and exigent idealism would
focus on something except herself.
‘then you like it here?’ she asked.
‘it might be fun if we knew those people. there were some
other people, but they weren’t nice. they recognized me—
no matter where we go everybody’s seen ‘daddy’s girl.’’
mrs. speers waited for the glow of egotism to subside;
then she said in a matter-of-fact way: ‘that reminds me,
when are you going to see earl brady?’
‘i thought we might go this afternoon—if you’re rested.’
‘you go—i’m not going.’
‘we’ll wait till to-morrow then.’
‘i want you to go alone. it’s only a short way—it isn’t as if
you didn’t speak french.’
‘mother—aren’t there some things i don’t have to do?’
‘oh, well then go later—but some day before we leave.’
‘all right, mother.’
after lunch they were both overwhelmed by the sudden
flatness that comes over american travellers in quiet foreign
places. no stimuli worked upon them, no voices called them 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 21
from without, no fragments of their own thoughts came
suddenly from the minds of others, and missing the clamor
of empire they felt that life was not continuing here.
‘let’s only stay three days, mother,’ rosemary said when
they were back in their rooms. outside a light wind blew
the heat around, straining it through the trees and sending
little hot gusts through the shutters.
‘how about the man you fell in love with on the beach?’
‘i don’t love anybody but you, mother, darling.’
rosemary stopped in the lobby and spoke to gausse père
about trains. the concierge, lounging in light-brown khaki
by the desk, stared at her rigidly, then suddenly remembered
the manners of his métier. she took the bus and rode with
a pair of obsequious waiters to the station, embarrassed by
their deferential silence, wanting to urge them: ‘go on, talk,
enjoy yourselves. it doesn’t bother me.’
the first-class compartment was stifling; the vivid advertising
cards of the railroad companies—the pont du
gard at arles, the amphitheatre at orange, winter sports
at chamonix—were fresher than the long motionless sea
outside. unlike american trains that were absorbed in an
intense destiny of their own, and scornful of people on another
world less swift and breathless, this train was part of
the country through which it passed. its breath stirred the
dust from the palm leaves, the cinders mingled with the
dry dung in the gardens. rosemary was sure she could lean
from the window and pull flowers with her hand.
a dozen cabbies slept in their hacks outside the cannes
station. over on the promenade the casino, the smart 
22 tender is the night
shops, and the great hotels turned blank iron masks to the
summer sea. it was unbelievable that there could ever have
been a ‘season,’ and rosemary, half in the grip of fashion,
became a little selfconscious, as though she were displaying
an unhealthy taste for the moribund; as though people were
wondering why she was here in the lull between the gaiety
of last winter and next winter, while up north the true world
thundered by.
as she came out of a drug store with a bottle of cocoanut
oil, a woman, whom she recognized as mrs. diver, crossed
her path with arms full of sofa cushions, and went to a car
parked down the street. a long, low black dog barked at her,
a dozing chauffeur woke with a start. she sat in the car, her
lovely face set, controlled, her eyes brave and watchful, looking
straight ahead toward nothing. her dress was bright red
and her brown legs were bare. she had thick, dark, gold hair
like a chow’s.
with half an hour to wait for her train rosemary sat
down in the café des alliés on the croisette, where the
trees made a green twilight over the tables and an orchestra
wooed an imaginary public of cosmopolites with the
nice carnival song and last year’s american tune. she had
bought le temps and the saturday evening post for her
mother, and as she drank her citronade she opened the latter
at the memoirs of a russian princess, finding the dim
conventions of the nineties realer and nearer than the
headlines of the french paper. it was the same feeling that
had oppressed her at the hotel—accustomed to seeing the
starkest grotesqueries of a continent heavily underlined as 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 23
comedy or tragedy, untrained to the task of separating out
the essential for herself, she now began to feel that french
life was empty and stale. this feeling was surcharged by listening
to the sad tunes of the orchestra, reminiscent of the
melancholy music played for acrobats in vaudeville. she was
glad to go back to gausse’s hotel.
her shoulders were too burned to swim with the next
day, so she and her mother hired a car—after much haggling,
for rosemary had formed her valuations of money
in france—and drove along the riviera, the delta of many
rivers. the chauffeur, a russian czar of the period of ivan
the terrible, was a self-appointed guide, and the resplendent
names—cannes, nice, monte carlo—began to glow
through their torpid camouflage, whispering of old kings
come here to dine or die, of rajahs tossing buddha’s eyes
to english ballerinas, of russian princes turning the weeks
into baltic twilights in the lost caviare days. most of all, there
was the scent of the russians along the coast—their closed
book shops and grocery stores. ten years ago, when the season
ended in april, the doors of the orthodox church were
locked, and the sweet champagnes they favored were put
away until their return. ‘we’ll be back next season,’ they
said, but this was premature, for they were never coming
back any more.
it was pleasant to drive back to the hotel in the late afternoon,
above a sea as mysteriously colored as the agates
and cornelians of childhood, green as green milk, blue as
laundry water, wine dark. it was pleasant to pass people eating
outside their doors, and to hear the fierce mechanical 
24 tender is the night
pianos behind the vines of country estaminets. when they
turned off the corniche d’or and down to gausse’s hotel
through the darkening banks of trees, set one behind another
in many greens, the moon already hovered over the
ruins of the aqueducts... .
somewhere in the hills behind the hotel there was a
dance, and rosemary listened to the music through the
ghostly moonshine of her mosquito net, realizing that there
was gaiety too somewhere about, and she thought of the
nice people on the beach. she thought she might meet them
in the morning, but they obviously formed a selfsufficient
little group, and once their umbrellas, bamboo rugs, dogs,
and children were set out in place the part of the plage was
literally fenced in. she resolved in any case not to spend her
last two mornings with the other ones.

the matter was solved for her. the mckiscos were not yet
there and she had scarcely spread her peignoir when two
men—the man with the jockey cap and the tall blonde man,
given to sawing waiters in two— left the group and came
down toward her.
‘good morning,’ said dick diver. he broke down.
‘look—sunburn or no sunburn, why did you stay away yesterday?
we worried about you.’
she sat up and her happy little laugh welcomed their intrusion.
‘we wondered,’ dick diver said, ‘if you wouldn’t come
over this morning. we go in, we take food and drink, so it’s
a substantial invitation.’
he seemed kind and charming—his voice promised that
he would take care of her, and that a little later he would open
up whole new worlds for her, unroll an endless succession
of magnificent possibilities. he managed the introduction
so that her name wasn’t mentioned and then let her know
easily that everyone knew who she was but were respecting
the completeness of her private life—a courtesy that rosemary
had not met with save from professional people since
her success.
nicole diver, her brown back hanging from her pearls,
was looking through a recipe book for chicken maryland. 
26 tender is the night
she was about twentyfour, rosemary guessed—her face
could have been described in terms of conventional prettiness,
but the effect was that it had been made first on the
heroic scale with strong structure and marking, as if the
features and vividness of brow and coloring, everything we
associate with temperament and character had been molded
with a rodinesque intention, and then chiseled away in the
direction of prettiness to a point where a single slip would
have irreparably diminished its force and quality. with the
mouth the sculptor had taken desperate chances—it was the
cupid’s bow of a magazine cover, yet it shared the distinction
of the rest.
‘are you here for a long time?’ nicole asked. her voice
was low, almost harsh.
suddenly rosemary let the possibility enter her mind
that they might stay another week.
‘not very long,’ she answered vaguely. ‘we’ve been abroad
a long time—we landed in sicily in march and we’ve been
slowly working our way north. i got pneumonia making a
picture last january and i’ve been recuperating.’
‘mercy! how did that happen?’
‘well, it was from swimming,’ rosemary was rather reluctant
at embarking upon personal revelations. ‘one day i
happened to have the grippe and didn’t know it, and they
were taking a scene where i dove into a canal in venice. it
was a very expensive set, so i had to dive and dive and dive
all morning. mother had a doctor right there, but it was
no use—i got pneumonia.’ she changed the subject determinedly
before they could speak. ‘do you like it here—this 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 27
place?’
‘they have to like it,’ said abe north slowly. ‘they invented
it.’ he turned his noble head slowly so that his eyes
rested with tenderness and affection on the two divers.
‘oh, did you?’
‘this is only the second season that the hotel’s been open
in summer,’ nicole explained. ‘we persuaded gausse to
keep on a cook and a garçon and a chasseur—it paid its way
and this year it’s doing even better.’
‘but you’re not in the hotel.’
‘we built a house, up at tarmes.’
‘the theory is,’ said dick, arranging an umbrella to clip
a square of sunlight off rosemary’s shoulder, ‘that all the
northern places, like deauville, were picked out by russians
and english who don’t mind the cold, while half of us
americans come from tropical climates—that’s why we’re
beginning to come here.’
the young man of latin aspect had been turning the

‘well, what nationality are these people?’ he demanded,
suddenly, and read with a slight french intonation, ‘‘registered
at the hotel palace at vevey are mr. pandely vlasco,

most— geneveva de momus. almost worth running up to

he stood up with sudden restlessness, stretching himself 
28 tender is the night
with one sharp movement. he was a few years younger than
diver or north. he was tall and his body was hard but overspare
save for the bunched force gathered in his shoulders
and upper arms. at first glance he seemed conventionally
handsome—but there was a faint disgust always in his
face which marred the full fierce lustre of his brown eyes.
yet one remembered them afterward, when one had forgotten
the inability of the mouth to endure boredom and the
young forehead with its furrows of fretful and unprofitable
pain.
‘we found some fine ones in the news of americans last
week,’ said nicole. ‘mrs. evelyn oyster and—what were the
others?’
‘there was mr. s. flesh,’ said diver, getting up also. he
took his rake and began to work seriously at getting small
stones out of the sand.
‘oh, yes—s. flesh—doesn’t he give you the creeps?’
it was quiet alone with nicole—rosemary found it even
quieter than with her mother. abe north and barban, the
frenchman, were talking about morocco, and nicole having
copied her recipe picked up a piece of sewing. rosemary
examined their appurtenances—four large parasols that
made a canopy of shade, a portable bath house for dressing,
a pneumatic rubber horse, new things that rosemary had
never seen, from the first burst of luxury manufacturing
after the war, and probably in the hands of the first of purchasers.
she had gathered that they were fashionable people,
but though her mother had brought her up to beware such
people as drones, she did not feel that way here. even in

their absolute immobility, complete as that of the morning,
she felt a purpose, a working over something, a direction,
an act of creation different from any she had known. her
immature mind made no speculations upon the nature of
their relation to each other, she was only concerned with
their attitude toward herself—but she perceived the web of
some pleasant interrelation, which she expressed with the
thought that they seemed to have a very good time.
she looked in turn at the three men, temporarily expropriating
them. all three were personable in different ways;
all were of a special gentleness that she felt was part of their
lives, past and future, not circumstanced by events, not at all
like the company manners of actors, and she detected also a
far-reaching delicacy that was different from the rough and
ready good fellowship of directors, who represented the intellectuals
in her life. actors and directors—those were the
only men she had ever known, those and the heterogeneous,
indistinguishable mass of college boys, interested only in
love at first sight, whom she had met at the yale prom last
fall.
these three were different. barban was less civilized,
more skeptical and scoffing, his manners were formal, even
perfunctory. abe north had, under his shyness, a desperate
humor that amused but puzzled her. her serious nature distrusted
its ability to make a supreme impression on him.
but dick diver—he was all complete there. silently she
admired him. his complexion was reddish and weatherburned,
so was his short hair—a light growth of it rolled
down his arms and hands. his eyes were of a bright, hard 
30 tender is the night
blue. his nose was somewhat pointed and there was never
any doubt at whom he was looking or talking—and this
is a flattering attention, for who looks at us?— glances fall
upon us, curious or disinterested, nothing more. his voice,
with some faint irish melody running through it, wooed the
world, yet she felt the layer of hardness in him, of self-control
and of self-discipline, her own virtues. oh, she chose
him, and nicole, lifting her head saw her choose him, heard
the little sigh at the fact that he was already possessed.
toward noon the mckiscos, mrs. abrams, mr. dumphry,
and signor campion came on the beach. they had brought
a new umbrella that they set up with side glances toward
the divers, and crept under with satisfied expressions—all
save mr. mckisco, who remained derisively without. in his
raking dick had passed near them and now he returned to
the umbrellas.
‘the two young men are reading the book of etiquette
together,’ he said in a low voice.
‘planning to mix wit de quality,’ said abe.
mary north, the very tanned young woman whom rosemary
had encountered the first day on the raft, came in from
swimming and said with a smile that was a rakish gleam:
‘so mr. and mrs. neverquiver have arrived.’
‘they’re this man’s friends,’ nicole reminded her, indicating
abe. ‘why doesn’t he go and speak to them? don’t
you think they’re attractive?’
‘i think they’re very attractive,’ abe agreed. ‘i just don’t
think they’re attractive, that’s all.’
‘well, i have felt there were too many people on the 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 31
beach this summer,’ nicole admitted. ‘our beach that dick
made out of a pebble pile.’ she considered, and then lowering
her voice out of the range of the trio of nannies who
sat back under another umbrella. ‘still, they’re preferable to
those british last summer who kept shouting about: ‘isn’t
the sea blue? isn’t the sky white? isn’t little nellie’s nose
red?’’
rosemary thought she would not like to have nicole for
an enemy.
‘but you didn’t see the fight,’ nicole continued. ‘the day
before you came, the married man, the one with the name
that sounds like a substitute for gasoline or butter—‘
‘mckisco?’
‘yes—well they were having words and she tossed some
sand in his face. so naturally he sat on top of her and rubbed
her face in the sand. we were—electrified. i wanted dick to
interfere.’
‘i think,’ said dick diver, staring down abstractedly at
the straw mat, ‘that i’ll go over and invite them to dinner.’
‘no, you won’t,’ nicole told him quickly.
‘i think it would be a very good thing. they’re here—let’s
adjust ourselves.’
‘we’re very well adjusted,’ she insisted, laughing. ‘i’m not
going to have my nose rubbed in the sand. i’m a mean, hard
woman,’ she explained to rosemary, and then raising her
voice, ‘children, put on your bathing suits!’
rosemary felt that this swim would become the typical
one of her life, the one that would always pop up in her
memory at the mention of swimming. simultaneously the 
32 tender is the night
whole party moved toward the water, super-ready from the
long, forced inaction, passing from the heat to the cool with
the gourmandise of a tingling curry eaten with chilled white
wine. the divers’ day was spaced like the day of the older
civilizations to yield the utmost from the materials at hand,
and to give all the transitions their full value, and she did
not know that there would be another transition presently
from the utter absorption of the swim to the garrulity of the
provençal lunch hour. but again she had the sense that dick
was taking care of her, and she delighted in responding to
the eventual movement as if it had been an order.
nicole handed her husband the curious garment on
which she had been working. he went into the dressing tent
and inspired a commotion by appearing in a moment clad
in transparent black lace drawers. close inspection revealed
that actually they were lined with fleshcolored cloth.
‘well, if that isn’t a pansys trick!’ exclaimed mr. mckisco
contemptuously—then turning quickly to mr. dumphry
and mr. campion, he added, ‘oh, i beg your pardon.’
rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks. her na-
ïveté responded whole-heartedly to the expensive simplicity
of the divers, unaware of its complexity and its lack of innocence,
unaware that it was all a selection of quality rather
than quantity from the run of the world’s bazaar; and that
the simplicity of behavior also, the nursery-like peace and
good will, the emphasis on the simpler virtues, was part of
a desperate bargain with the gods and had been attained
through struggles she could not have guessed at. at that
moment the divers represented externally the exact fur-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 33
thermost evolution of a class, so that most people seemed
awkward beside them—in reality a qualitative change had
already set in that was not at all apparent to rosemary.
she stood with them as they took sherry and ate crackers.
dick diver looked at her with cold blue eyes; his kind,
strong mouth said thoughtfully and deliberately:
‘you’re the only girl i’ve seen for a long time that actually
did look like something blooming.’
in her mother’s lap afterward rosemary cried and cried.
‘i love him, mother. i’m desperately in love with him—i
never knew i could feel that way about anybody. and he’s
married and i like her too—it’s just hopeless. oh, i love him
so!’
‘i’m curious to meet him.’
‘she invited us to dinner friday.’
‘if you’re in love it ought to make you happy. you ought
to laugh.’
rosemary looked up and gave a beautiful little shiver of
her face and laughed. her mother always had a great influence
on her.
34 tender is the night
v
rosemary went to monte carlo nearly as sulkily as it
was possible for her to be. she rode up the rugged hill to
la turbie, to an old gaumont lot in process of reconstruction,
and as she stood by the grilled entrance waiting for
an answer to the message on her card, she might have been
looking into hollywood. the bizarre débris of some recent
picture, a decayed street scene in india, a great cardboard
whale, a monstrous tree bearing cherries large as basketballs,
bloomed there by exotic dispensation, autochthonous
as the pale amaranth, mimosa, cork oak or dwarfed pine.
there were a quick-lunch shack and two barnlike stages and
everywhere about the lot, groups of waiting, hopeful, painted
faces.
after ten minutes a young man with hair the color of canary
feathers hurried down to the gate.
‘come in, miss hoyt. mr. brady’s on the set, but he’s very
anxious to see you. i’m sorry you were kept waiting, but you
know some of these french dames are worse about pushing
themselves in—‘
the studio manager opened a small door in the blank
wall of stage building and with sudden glad familiarity
rosemary followed him into half darkness. here and
there figures spotted the twilight, turning up ashen faces
to her like souls in purgatory watching the passage of a 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 35
mortal through. there were whispers and soft voices and,
apparently from afar, the gentle tremolo of a small organ.
turning the corner made by some flats, they came upon the
white crackling glow of a stage, where a french actor—his
shirt front, collar, and cuffs tinted a brilliant pink—and an
american actress stood motionless face to face. they stared
at each other with dogged eyes, as though they had been in
the same position for hours; and still for a long time nothing
happened, no one moved. a bank of lights went off with
a savage hiss, went on again; the plaintive tap of a hammer
begged admission to nowhere in the distance; a blue face appeared
among the blinding lights above, called something
unintelligible into the upper blackness. then the silence was
broken by a voice in front of rosemary.
‘baby, you don’t take off the stockings, you can spoil ten
more pairs. that dress is fifteen pounds.’
stepping backward the speaker ran against rosemary,
whereupon the studio manager said, ‘hey, earl—miss
hoyt.’
they were meeting for the first time. brady was quick
and strenuous. as he took her hand she saw him look her
over from head to foot, a gesture she recognized and that
made her feel at home, but gave her always a faint feeling of
superiority to whoever made it. if her person was property
she could exercise whatever advantage was inherent in its
ownership.
‘i thought you’d be along any day now,’ brady said, in a
voice that was just a little too compelling for private life, and
that trailed with it a faintly defiant cockney accent. ‘have a 
36 tender is the night
good trip?’
‘yes, but we’re glad to be going home.’
‘no-o-o!’ he protested. ‘stay awhile—i want to talk to
you. let me tell you that was some picture of yours—that
‘daddy’s girl.’ i saw it in paris. i wired the coast right away
to see if you were signed.’
‘i just had—i’m sorry.’
‘god, what a picture!’
not wanting to smile in silly agreement rosemary
frowned.
‘nobody wants to be thought of forever for just one picture,’
she said.
‘sure—that’s right. what’re your plans?’
‘mother thought i needed a rest. when i get back we’ll
probably either sign up with first national or keep on with
famous.’
‘who’s we?’
‘my mother. she decides business matters. i couldn’t do
without her.’
again he looked her over completely, and, as he did,
something in rosemary went out to him. it was not liking,
not at all the spontaneous admiration she had felt for the
man on the beach this morning. it was a click. he desired
her and, so far as her virginal emotions went, she contemplated
a surrender with equanimity. yet she knew she would
forget him half an hour after she left him—like an actor
kissed in a picture.
‘where are you staying?’ brady asked. ‘oh, yes, at
gausse’s. well, my plans are made for this year, too, but that 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 37
letter i wrote you still stands. rather make a picture with
you than any girl since connie talmadge was a kid.’
‘i feel the same way. why don’t you come back to hollywood?’
‘i can’t stand the damn place. i’m fine here. wait till after
this shot and i’ll show you around.’
walking onto the set he began to talk to the french actor
in a low, quiet voice.
five minutes passed—brady talked on, while from
time to time the frenchman shifted his feet and nodded.
abruptly, brady broke off, calling something to the lights
that startled them into a humming glare. los angeles was
loud about rosemary now. unappalled she moved once
more through the city of thin partitions, wanting to be back
there. but she did not want to see brady in the mood she
sensed he would be in after he had finished and she left the
lot with a spell still upon her. the mediterranean world was
less silent now that she knew the studio was there. she liked
the people on the streets and bought herself a pair of espadrilles
on the way to the train.
her mother was pleased that she had done so accurately
what she was told to do, but she still wanted to launch her
out and away. mrs. speers was fresh in appearance but she
was tired; death beds make people tired indeed and she had
watched beside a couple.
38 tender is the night
vi
feeling good from the rosy wine at lunch, nicole diver
folded her arms high enough for the artificial camellia on
her shoulder to touch her cheek, and went out into her lovely
grassless garden. the garden was bounded on one side by
the house, from which it flowed and into which it ran, on
two sides by the old village, and on the last by the cliff falling
by ledges to the sea.
along the walls on the village side all was dusty, the
wriggling vines, the lemon and eucalyptus trees, the casual
wheel-barrow, left only a moment since, but already grown
into the path, atrophied and faintly rotten. nicole was invariably
somewhat surprised that by turning in the other
direction past a bed of peonies she walked into an area so
green and cool that the leaves and petals were curled with
tender damp.
knotted at her throat she wore a lilac scarf that even in
the achromatic sunshine cast its color up to her face and
down around her moving feet in a lilac shadow. her face
was hard, almost stern, save for the soft gleam of piteous
doubt that looked from her green eyes. her once fair hair
had darkened, but she was lovelier now at twenty-four than
she had been at eighteen, when her hair was brighter than
she.
following a walk marked by an intangible mist of bloom 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 39
that followed the white border stones she came to a space
overlooking the sea where there were lanterns asleep in the
fig trees and a big table and wicker chairs and a great market
umbrella from sienna, all gathered about an enormous
pine, the biggest tree in the garden. she paused there a moment,
looking absently at a growth of nasturtiums and iris
tangled at its foot, as though sprung from a careless handful
of seeds, listening to the plaints and accusations of some
nursery squabble in the house. when this died away on the
summer air, she walked on, between kaleidoscopic peonies
massed in pink clouds, black and brown tulips and fragile
mauve-stemmed roses, transparent like sugar flowers in
a confectioner’s window— until, as if the scherzo of color
could reach no further intensity, it broke off suddenly in
mid-air, and moist steps went down to a level five feet below.
here there was a well with the boarding around it dank
and slippery even on the brightest days. she went up the
stairs on the other side and into the vegetable garden; she
walked rather quickly; she liked to be active, though at
times she gave an impression of repose that was at once
static and evocative. this was because she knew few words
and believed in none, and in the world she was rather silent,
contributing just her share of urbane humor with a precision
that approached meagreness. but at the moment when
strangers tended to grow uncomfortable in the presence of
this economy she would seize the topic and rush off with
it, feverishly surprised with herself—then bring it back and
relinquish it abruptly, almost timidly, like an obedient re-
40 tender is the night
triever, having been adequate and something more.
as she stood in the fuzzy green light of the vegetable
garden, dick crossed the path ahead of her going to his
work house. nicole waited silently till he had passed; then
she went on through lines of prospective salads to a little
menagerie where pigeons and rabbits and a parrot made
a medley of insolent noises at her. descending to another
ledge she reached a low, curved wall and looked down seven
hundred feet to the mediterranean sea.
she stood in the ancient hill village of tarmes. the villa
and its grounds were made out of a row of peasant dwellings
that abutted on the cliff—five small houses had been
combined to make the house and four destroyed to make
the garden. the exterior walls were untouched so that from
the road far below it was indistinguishable from the violet
gray mass of the town.
for a moment nicole stood looking down at the mediterranean
but there was nothing to do with that, even with
her tireless hands. presently dick came out of his one-room
house carrying a telescope and looked east toward cannes.
in a moment nicole swam into his field of vision, whereupon
he disappeared into his house and came out with a
megaphone. he had many light mechanical devices.
‘nicole,’ he shouted, ‘i forgot to tell you that as a final apostolic
gesture i invited mrs. abrams, the woman with the
white hair.’
‘i suspected it. it’s an outrage.’
the ease with which her reply reached him seemed to
belittle his megaphone, so she raised her voice and called, 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 41
‘can you hear me?’
‘yes.’ he lowered the megaphone and then raised it stubbornly.
‘i’m going to invite some more people too. i’m going
to invite the two young men.’
‘all right,’ she agreed placidly.
‘i want to give a really bad party. i mean it. i want to
give a party where there’s a brawl and seductions and people
going home with their feelings hurt and women passed out
in the cabinet de toilette. you wait and see.’
he went back into his house and nicole saw that one
of his most characteristic moods was upon him, the excitement
that swept everyone up into it and was inevitably
followed by his own form of melancholy, which he never
displayed but at which she guessed. this excitement about
things reached an intensity out of proportion to their importance,
generating a really extraordinary virtuosity with
people. save among a few of the tough-minded and perennially
suspicious, he had the power of arousing a fascinated
and uncritical love. the reaction came when he realized the
waste and extravagance involved. he sometimes looked
back with awe at the carnivals of affection he had given, as a
general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy
an impersonal blood lust.
but to be included in dick diver’s world for a while was a
remarkable experience: people believed he made special reservations
about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of
their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many
years. he won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration
and a politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that 
42 tender is the night
it could be examined only in its effect. then, without caution,
lest the first bloom of the relation wither, he opened
the gate to his amusing world. so long as they subscribed to
it completely, their happiness was his preoccupation, but at
the first flicker of doubt as to its allinclusiveness he evaporated
before their eyes, leaving little communicable memory
of what he had said or done.
at eight-thirty that evening he came out to meet his
first guests, his coat carried rather ceremoniously, rather
promisingly, in his hand, like a toreador’s cape. it was characteristic
that after greeting rosemary and her mother he
waited for them to speak first, as if to allow them the reassurance
of their own voices in new surroundings.
to resume rosemary’s point of view it should be said
that, under the spell of the climb to tarmes and the fresher
air, she and her mother looked about appreciatively. just
as the personal qualities of extraordinary people can make
themselves plain in an unaccustomed change of expression,
so the intensely calculated perfection of villa diana transpired
all at once through such minute failures as the chance
apparition of a maid in the background or the perversity of
a cork. while the first guests arrived bringing with them
the excitement of the night, the domestic activity of the day
receded past them gently, symbolized by the diver children
and their governess still at supper on the terrace.
‘what a beautiful garden!’ mrs. speers exclaimed.
‘nicole’s garden,’ said dick. ‘she won’t let it alone—she
nags it all the time, worries about its diseases. any day now
i expect to have her come down with powdery mildew or fly 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 43
speck, or late blight.’ he pointed his forefinger decisively at
rosemary, saying with a lightness seeming to conceal a paternal
interest, ‘i’m going to save your reason—i’m going to
give you a hat to wear on the beach.’
he turned them from the garden to the terrace, where he
poured a cocktail. earl brady arrived, discovering rosemary
with surprise. his manner was softer than at the studio, as if
his differentness had been put on at the gate, and rosemary,
comparing him instantly with dick diver, swung sharply
toward the latter. in comparison earl brady seemed faintly
gross, faintly ill-bred; once more, though, she felt an electric
response to his person.
he spoke familiarly to the children who were getting up
from their outdoor supper.
‘hello, lanier, how about a song? will you and topsy
sing me a song?’
‘what shall we sing?’ agreed the little boy, with the
odd chanting accent of american children brought up in
france.
‘that song about ‘mon ami pierrot.’’
brother and sister stood side by side without self-consciousness
and their voices soared sweet and shrill upon the
evening air.
“au clair de la lune
mon ami pierrot
prête-moi ta plume
pour écrire un mot
ma chandelle est morte
44 tender is the night
je n’ai plus de feu
ouvre-moi ta porte
pour l’amour de dieu.’
the singing ceased and the children, their faces aglow
with the late sunshine, stood smiling calmly at their success.
rosemary was thinking that the villa diana was the
centre of the world. on such a stage some memorable thing
was sure to happen. she lighted up higher as the gate tinkled
open and the rest of the guests arrived in a body—the
mckiscos, mrs. abrams, mr. dumphry, and mr. campion
came up to the terrace.
rosemary had a sharp feeling of disappointment—she
looked quickly at dick, as though to ask an explanation of
this incongruous mingling. but there was nothing unusual
in his expression. he greeted his new guests with a proud
bearing and an obvious deference to their infinite and
unknown possibilities. she believed in him so much that
presently she accepted the rightness of the mckiscos’ presence
as if she had expected to meet them all along.
‘i’ve met you in paris,’ mckisco said to abe north, who
with his wife had arrived on their heels, ‘in fact i’ve met you
twice.’
‘yes, i remember,’ abe said.
‘then where was it?’ demanded mckisco, not content to
let well enough alone.
‘why, i think—‘ abe got tired of the game, ‘i can’t remember.’
the interchange filled a pause and rosemary’s instinct 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 45
was that something tactful should be said by somebody, but
dick made no attempt to break up the grouping formed by
these late arrivals, not even to disarm mrs. mckisco of her
air of supercilious amusement. he did not solve this social
problem because he knew it was not of importance at the
moment and would solve itself. he was saving his newness
for a larger effort, waiting a more significant moment for his
guests to be conscious of a good time.
rosemary stood beside tommy barban—he was in a
particularly scornful mood and there seemed to be some
special stimulus working upon him. he was leaving in the
morning.
‘going home?’
‘home? i have no home. i am going to a war.’
‘what war?’
‘what war? any war. i haven’t seen a paper lately but i
suppose there’s a war—there always is.’
‘don’t you care what you fight for?’
‘not at all—so long as i’m well treated. when i’m in a rut
i come to see the divers, because then i know that in a few
weeks i’ll want to go to war.’
rosemary stiffened.
‘you like the divers,’ she reminded him.
‘of course—especially her—but they make me want to
go to war.’
she considered this, to no avail. the divers made her
want to stay near them forever.
‘you’re half american,’ she said, as if that should solve
the problem.
46 tender is the night
‘also i’m half french, and i was educated in england and
since i was eighteen i’ve worn the uniforms of eight countries.
but i hope i did not give you the impression that i am
not fond of the divers— i am, especially of nicole.’
‘how could any one help it?’ she said simply.
she felt far from him. the undertone of his words repelled
her and she withdrew her adoration for the divers
from the profanity of his bitterness. she was glad he was
not next to her at dinner and she was still thinking of his
words ‘especially her’ as they moved toward the table in the
garden.
for a moment now she was beside dick diver on the
path. alongside his hard, neat brightness everything faded
into the surety that he knew everything. for a year, which
was forever, she had had money and a certain celebrity and
contact with the celebrated, and these latter had presented
themselves merely as powerful enlargements of the people
with whom the doctor’s widow and her daughter had associated
in a hôtel-pension in paris. rosemary was a romantic
and her career had not provided many satisfactory opportunities
on that score. her mother, with the idea of a career
for rosemary, would not tolerate any such spurious substitutes
as the excitations available on all sides, and indeed
rosemary was already beyond that—she was in the movies
but not at all at them. so when she had seen approval of
dick diver in her mother’s face it meant that he was ‘the real
thing”; it meant permission to go as far as she could.
‘i was watching you,’ he said, and she knew he meant it.
‘we’ve grown very fond of you.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 47
‘i fell in love with you the first time i saw you,’ she said
quietly. he pretended not to have heard, as if the compliment
were purely formal.
‘new friends,’ he said, as if it were an important point,
‘can often have a better time together than old friends.’
with that remark, which she did not understand precisely,
she found herself at the table, picked out by slowly
emerging lights against the dark dusk. a chord of delight
struck inside her when she saw that dick had taken her
mother on his right hand; for herself she was between luis
campion and brady.
surcharged with her emotion she turned to brady with
the intention of confiding in him, but at her first mention
of dick a hard-boiled sparkle in his eyes gave her to understand
that he refused the fatherly office. in turn she
was equally firm when he tried to monopolize her hand,
so they talked shop or rather she listened while he talked
shop, her polite eyes never leaving his face, but her mind
was so definitely elsewhere that she felt he must guess the
fact. intermittently she caught the gist of his sentences and
supplied the rest from her subconscious, as one picks up the
striking of a clock in the middle with only the rhythm of the
first uncounted strokes lingering in the mind.
48 tender is the night
vii
in a pause rosemary looked away and up the table where
nicole sat between tommy barban and abe north, her
chow’s hair foaming and frothing in the candlelight. rosemary
listened, caught sharply by the rich clipped voice in
infrequent speech:
‘the poor man,’ nicole exclaimed. ‘why did you want to
saw him in two?’
‘naturally i wanted to see what was inside a waiter.
wouldn’t you like to know what was inside a waiter?’
‘old menus,’ suggested nicole with a short laugh. ‘pieces
of broken china and tips and pencil stubs.’
‘exactly—but the thing was to prove it scientifically. and
of course doing it with that musical saw would have eliminated
any sordidness.’
‘did you intend to play the saw while you performed the
operation?’ tommy inquired.
‘we didn’t get quite that far. we were alarmed by the
screams. we thought he might rupture something.’
‘all sounds very peculiar to me,’ said nicole. ‘any musician
that’ll use another musician’s saw to—‘
they had been at table half an hour and a perceptible
change had set in—person by person had given up something,
a preoccupation, an anxiety, a suspicion, and now
they were only their best selves and the divers’ guests. not 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 49
to have been friendly and interested would have seemed to
reflect on the divers, so now they were all trying, and seeing
this, rosemary liked everyone—except mckisco, who had
contrived to be the unassimilated member of the party. this
was less from ill will than from his determination to sustain
with wine the good spirits he had enjoyed on his arrival. lying
back in his place between earl brady, to whom he had
addressed several withering remarks about the movies, and
mrs. abrams, to whom he said nothing, he stared at dick
diver with an expression of devastating irony, the effect being
occasionally interrupted by his attempts to engage dick
in a cater-cornered conversation across the table.
‘aren’t you a friend of van buren denby?’ he would say.
‘i don’t believe i know him.’
‘i thought you were a friend of his,’ he persisted irritably.
when the subject of mr. denby fell of its own weight,
he essayed other equally irrelative themes, but each time
the very deference of dick’s attention seemed to paralyze
him, and after a moment’s stark pause the conversation
that he had interrupted would go on without him. he tried
breaking into other dialogues, but it was like continually
shaking hands with a glove from which the hand had been
withdrawn—so finally, with a resigned air of being among
children, he devoted his attention entirely to the champagne.
rosemary’s glance moved at intervals around the table,
eager for the others’ enjoyment, as if they were her future
stepchildren. a gracious table light, emanating from a bowl 
50 tender is the night
of spicy pinks, fell upon mrs. abrams’ face, cooked to a turn
in veuve cliquot, full of vigor, tolerance, adolescent good
will; next to her sat mr. royal dumphry, his girl’s comeliness
less startling in the pleasure world of evening. then
violet mckisco, whose prettiness had been piped to the surface
of her, so that she ceased her struggle to make tangible
to herself her shadowy position as the wife of an arriviste
who had not arrived.
then came dick, with his arms full of the slack he had
taken up from others, deeply merged in his own party.
then her mother, forever perfect.
then barban talking to her mother with an urbane fluency
that made rosemary like him again. then nicole.
rosemary saw her suddenly in a new way and found her one
of the most beautiful people she had ever known. her face,
the face of a saint, a viking madonna, shone through the
faint motes that snowed across the candlelight, drew down
its flush from the wine-colored lanterns in the pine. she was
still as still.
abe north was talking to her about his moral code: ‘of
course i’ve got one,’ he insisted, ‘—a man can’t live without
a moral code. mine is that i’m against the burning of
witches. whenever they burn a witch i get all hot under the
collar.’ rosemary knew from brady that he was a musician
who after a brilliant and precocious start had composed
nothing for seven years.
next was campion, managing somehow to restrain his
most blatant effeminacy, and even to visit upon those near
him a certain disinterested motherliness. then mary north

with a face so merry that it was impossible not to smile back
into the white mirrors of her teeth—the whole area around
her parted lips was a lovely little circle of delight.
finally brady, whose heartiness became, moment by
moment, a social thing instead of a crude assertion and reassertion
of his own mental health, and his preservation of
it by a detachment from the frailties of others.
rosemary, as dewy with belief as a child from one of mrs.
burnett’s vicious tracts, had a conviction of homecoming, of
a return from the derisive and salacious improvisations of
the frontier. there were fireflies riding on the dark air and
a dog baying on some low and far-away ledge of the cliff.
the table seemed to have risen a little toward the sky like
a mechanical dancing platform, giving the people around
it a sense of being alone with each other in the dark universe,
nourished by its only food, warmed by its only lights.
and, as if a curious hushed laugh from mrs. mckisco were
a signal that such a detachment from the world had been
attained, the two divers began suddenly to warm and glow
and expand, as if to make up to their guests, already so subtly
assured of their importance, so flattered with politeness,
for anything they might still miss from that country well
left behind. just for a moment they seemed to speak to every
one at the table, singly and together, assuring them of their
friendliness, their affection. and for a moment the faces
turned up toward them were like the faces of poor children
at a christmas tree. then abruptly the table broke up—the
moment when the guests had been daringly lifted above
conviviality into the rarer atmosphere of sentiment, was 
52 tender is the night
over before it could be irreverently breathed, before they
had half realized it was there.
but the diffused magic of the hot sweet south had withdrawn
into them—the soft-pawed night and the ghostly
wash of the mediterranean far below—the magic left these
things and melted into the two divers and became part of
them. rosemary watched nicole pressing upon her mother
a yellow evening bag she had admired, saying, ‘i think
things ought to belong to the people that like them’—and
then sweeping into it all the yellow articles she could find,
a pencil, a lipstick, a little note book, ‘because they all go
together.’
nicole disappeared and presently rosemary noticed that
dick was no longer there; the guests distributed themselves
in the garden or drifted in toward the terrace.
‘do you want,’ violet mckisco asked rosemary, ‘to go to
the bathroom?’
not at that precise moment.
‘i want,’ insisted mrs. mckisco, ‘to go to the bathroom.’
as a frank outspoken woman she walked toward the house,
dragging her secret after her, while rosemary looked after
with reprobation. earl brady proposed that they walk down
to the sea wall but she felt that this was her time to have a
share of dick diver when he reappeared, so she stalled, listening
to mckisco quarrel with barban.
‘why do you want to fight the soviets?’ mckisco said.
‘the greatest experiment ever made by humanity? and the
riff? it seems to me it would be more heroic to fight on the
just side.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 53
‘how do you find out which it is?’ asked barban dryly.
‘why—usually everybody intelligent knows.’
‘are you a communist?’
‘i’m a socialist,’ said mckisco, ‘i sympathize with russia.’
‘well, i’m a soldier,’ barban answered pleasantly. ‘my
business is to kill people. i fought against the riff because i
am a european, and i have fought the communists because
they want to take my property from me.’
‘of all the narrow-minded excuses,’ mckisco looked
around to establish a derisive liaison with some one else,
but without success. he had no idea what he was up against
in barban, neither of the simplicity of the other man’s bag of
ideas nor of the complexity of his training. mckisco knew
what ideas were, and as his mind grew he was able to recognize
and sort an increasing number of them—but faced by a
man whom he considered ‘dumb,’ one in whom he found no
ideas he could recognize as such, and yet to whom he could
not feel personally superior, he jumped at the conclusion
that barban was the end product of an archaic world, and as
such, worthless. mckisco’s contacts with the princely classes
in america had impressed upon him their uncertain and
fumbling snobbery, their delight in ignorance and their deliberate
rudeness, all lifted from the english with no regard
paid to factors that make english philistinism and rudeness
purposeful, and applied in a land where a little knowledge
and civility buy more than they do anywhere else—an attitude
which reached its apogee in the ‘harvard manner’
of about 1900. he thought that this barban was of that 
54 tender is the night
type, and being drunk rashly forgot that he was in awe of
him—this led up to the trouble in which he presently found
himself.
feeling vaguely ashamed for mckisco, rosemary waited,
placid but inwardly on fire, for dick diver’s return. from
her chair at the deserted table with barban, mckisco, and
abe she looked up along the path edged with shadowy myrtle
and fern to the stone terrace, and falling in love with her
mother’s profile against a lighted door, was about to go there
when mrs. mckisco came hurrying down from the house.
she exuded excitement. in the very silence with which
she pulled out a chair and sat down, her eyes staring, her
mouth working a little, they all recognized a person cropfull
of news, and her husband’s ‘what’s the matter, vi?’
came naturally, as all eyes turned toward her.
‘my dear—‘ she said at large, and then addressed rosemary,
‘my dear—it’s nothing. i really can’t say a word.’
‘you’re among friends,’ said abe.
‘well, upstairs i came upon a scene, my dears—‘
shaking her head cryptically she broke off just in time,
for tommy arose and addressed her politely but sharply:
‘it’s inadvisable to comment on what goes on in this
house.’

violet breathed loud and hard once and with an effort
brought another expression into her face.
dick came finally and with a sure instinct he separated
barban and the mckiscos and became excessively ignorant
and inquisitive about literature with mckisco—thus giving
the latter the moment of superiority which he required.
the others helped him carry lamps up—who would not be
pleased at carrying lamps helpfully through the darkness?
rosemary helped, meanwhile responding patiently to royal
dumphry’s inexhaustible curiosity about hollywood.
now—she was thinking—i’ve earned a time alone with
him. he must know that because his laws are like the laws
mother taught me.
rosemary was right—presently he detached her from the
company on the terrace, and they were alone together, borne
away from the house toward the seaside wall with what were
less steps than irregularly spaced intervals through some of
which she was pulled, through others blown.
they looked out over the mediterranean. far below, the
last excursion boat from the isles des lerins floated across
the bay like a fourth-of-july balloon foot-loose in the heavens.
between the black isles it floated, softly parting the
dark tide.
‘i understand why you speak as you do of your mother,’ 
56 tender is the night
he said. ‘her attitude toward you is very fine, i think. she
has a sort of wisdom that’s rare in america.’
‘mother is perfect,’ she prayed.
‘i was talking to her about a plan i have—she told me
that how long you both stayed in france depended on you.’
on you, rosemary all but said aloud.
‘so since things are over down here—‘
‘over?’ she inquired.
‘well, this is over—this part of the summer is over. last
week nicole’s sister left, to-morrow tommy barban leaves,
monday abe and mary north are leaving. maybe we’ll have
more fun this summer but this particular fun is over. i want
it to die violently instead of fading out sentimentally—that’s
why i gave this party. what i’m coming to is—nicole and
i are going up to paris to see abe north off for america—i
wonder if you’d like to go with us.’
‘what did mother say?’
‘she seemed to think it would be fine. she doesn’t want to
go herself. she wants you to go alone.’
‘i haven’t seen paris since i’ve been grown,’ said rosemary.
‘i’d love to see it with you.’
‘that’s nice of you.’ did she imagine that his voice was
suddenly metallic? ‘of course we’ve been excited about you
from the moment you came on the beach. that vitality, we
were sure it was professional—especially nicole was. it’d
never use itself up on any one person or group.’
her instinct cried out to her that he was passing her
along slowly toward nicole and she put her own brakes on,
saying with an equal harness:
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 57
‘i wanted to know all of you too—especially you. i told
you i fell in love with you the first time i saw you.’
she was right going at it that way. but the space between
heaven and earth had cooled his mind, destroyed the impulsiveness
that had led him to bring her here, and made
him aware of the too obvious appeal, the struggle with an
unrehearsed scene and unfamiliar words.
he tried now to make her want to go back to the house
and it was difficult, and he did not quite want to lose her.
she felt only the draft blowing as he joked with her goodhumoredly.
‘you don’t know what you want. you go and ask your
mother what you want.’
she was stricken. she touched him, feeling the smooth
cloth of his dark coat like a chasuble. she seemed about to
fall to her knees— from that position she delivered her last
shot.
‘i think you’re the most wonderful person i ever met—
except my mother.’
‘you have romantic eyes.’
his laughter swept them on up toward the terrace where
he delivered her to nicole... .
too soon it had become time to go and the divers helped
them all to go quickly. in the divers’ big isotta there would
be tommy barban and his baggage—he was spending the
night at the hotel to catch an early train—with mrs. abrams,
the mckiscos and campion. earl brady was going to drop
rosemary and her mother on his way to monte carlo, and
royal dumphry rode with them because the divers’ car was 
58 tender is the night
crowded. down in the garden lanterns still glowed over the
table where they had dined, as the divers stood side by side
in the gate, nicole blooming away and filling the night with
graciousness, and dick bidding good-by to everyone by
name. to rosemary it seemed very poignant to drive away
and leave them in their house. again she wondered what
mrs. mckisco had seen in the bathroom.

ix
it was a limpid black night, hung as in a basket from a single
dull star. the horn of the car ahead was muffled by the
resistance of the thick air. brady’s chauffeur drove slowly;
the tail-light of the other car appeared from time to time
at turnings—then not at all. but after ten minutes it came
into sight again, drawn up at the side of the road. brady’s
chauffeur slowed up behind but immediately it began to roll
forward slowly and they passed it. in the instant they passed
it they heard a blur of voices from behind the reticence of
the limousine and saw that the divers’ chauffeur was grinning.
then they went on, going fast through the alternating
banks of darkness and thin night, descending at last in a
series of roller-coaster swoops, to the great bulk of gausse’s
hotel.
rosemary dozed for three hours and then lay awake, suspended
in the moonshine. cloaked by the erotic darkness
she exhausted the future quickly, with all the eventualities
that might lead up to a kiss, but with the kiss itself as
blurred as a kiss in pictures. she changed position in bed
deliberately, the first sign of insomnia she had ever had, and
tried to think with her mother’s mind about the question.
in this process she was often acute beyond her experience,
with remembered things from old conversations that had
gone into her half-heard.
60 tender is the night
rosemary had been brought up with the idea of work.
mrs. speers had spent the slim leavings of the men who
had widowed her on her daughter’s education, and when
she blossomed out at sixteen with that extraordinary hair,
rushed her to aix-les-bains and marched her unannounced
into the suite of an american producer who was recuperating
there. when the producer went to new york they went
too. thus rosemary had passed her entrance examinations.
with the ensuing success and the promise of comparative
stability that followed, mrs. speers had felt free to tacitly
imply tonight:
‘you were brought up to work—not especially to marry.
now you’ve found your first nut to crack and it’s a good
nut—go ahead and put whatever happens down to experience.
wound yourself or him— whatever happens it can’t
spoil you because economically you’re a boy, not a girl.’
rosemary had never done much thinking, save about the
illimitability of her mother’s perfections, so this final severance
of the umbilical cord disturbed her sleep. a false dawn
sent the sky pressing through the tall french windows, and
getting up she walked out on the terrace, warm to her bare
feet. there were secret noises in the air, an insistent bird
achieved an ill-natured triumph with regularity in the trees
above the tennis court; footfalls followed a round drive in
the rear of the hotel, taking their tone in turn from the dust
road, the crushed-stone walk, the cement steps, and then
reversing the process in going away. beyond the inky sea
and far up that high, black shadow of a hill lived the divers.
she thought of them both together, heard them still singing 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 61
faintly a song like rising smoke, like a hymn, very remote in
time and far away. their children slept, their gate was shut
for the night.
she went inside and dressing in a light gown and espadrilles
went out her window again and along the continuous
terrace toward the front door, going fast since she found
that other private rooms, exuding sleep, gave upon it. she
stopped at the sight of a figure seated on the wide white
stairway of the formal entrance—then she saw that it was
luis campion and that he was weeping.
he was weeping hard and quietly and shaking in the
same parts as a weeping woman. a scene in a role she had
played last year swept over her irresistibly and advancing
she touched him on the shoulder. he gave a little yelp before
he recognized her.
‘what is it?’ her eyes were level and kind and not slanted
into him with hard curiosity. ‘can i help you?’
‘nobody can help me. i knew it. i have only myself to
blame. it’s always the same.’
‘what is it—do you want to tell me?’
he looked at her to see.
‘no,’ he decided. ‘when you’re older you’ll know what
people who love suffer. the agony. it’s better to be cold and
young than to love. it’s happened to me before but never like
this—so accidental—just when everything was going well.’
his face was repulsive in the quickening light. not by a
flicker of her personality, a movement of the smallest muscle,
did she betray her sudden disgust with whatever it was.
but campion’s sensitivity realized it and he changed the 
62 tender is the night
subject rather suddenly.
‘abe north is around here somewhere.’
‘why, he’s staying at the divers’!’
‘yes, but he’s up—don’t you know what happened?’
a shutter opened suddenly in a room two stories above
and an english voice spat distinctly:
‘will you kaindlay stup tucking!’
rosemary and luis campion went humbly down the
steps and to a bench beside the road to the beach.
‘then you have no idea what’s happened? my dear, the
most extraordinary thing—‘ he was warming up now,
hanging on to his revelation. ‘i’ve never seen a thing come
so suddenly—i have always avoided violent people—they
upset me so i sometimes have to go to bed for days.’
he looked at her triumphantly. she had no idea what he
was talking about.
‘my dear,’ he burst forth, leaning toward her with his
whole body as he touched her on the upper leg, to show it
was no mere irresponsible venture of his hand—he was so
sure of himself. ‘there’s going to be a duel.’
‘wh-at?’
‘a duel with—we don’t know what yet.’
‘who’s going to duel?’
‘i’ll tell you from the beginning.’ he drew a long breath
and then said, as if it were rather to her discredit but he
wouldn’t hold it against her. ‘of course, you were in the other
automobile. well, in a way you were lucky—i lost at least
two years of my life, it came so suddenly.’
‘what came?’ she demanded.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 63
‘i don’t know what began it. first she began to talk—‘
‘who?’
‘violet mckisco.’ he lowered his voice as if there were
people under the bench. ‘but don’t mention the divers because
he made threats against anybody who mentioned it.’
‘who did?’
‘tommy barban, so don’t you say i so much as mentioned
them. none of us ever found out anyhow what it was violet
had to say because he kept interrupting her, and then her
husband got into it and now, my dear, we have the duel. this
morning—at five o’clock—in an hour.’ he sighed suddenly
thinking of his own griefs. ‘i almost wish it were i. i might
as well be killed now i have nothing to live for.’ he broke off
and rocked to and fro with sorrow.
again the iron shutter parted above and the same british
voice said:
‘rilly, this must stup immejetely.’
simultaneously abe north, looking somewhat distracted,
came out of the hotel, perceived them against the sky,
white over the sea. rosemary shook her head warningly before
he could speak and they moved another bench further
down the road. rosemary saw that abe was a little tight.
‘what are you doing up?’ he demanded.
‘i just got up.’ she started to laugh, but remembering the
voice above, she restrained herself.
‘plagued by the nightingale,’ abe suggested, and repeated,
‘probably plagued by the nightingale. has this
sewing-circle member told you what happened?’
campion said with dignity:
64 tender is the night
‘i only know what i heard with my own ears.’
he got up and walked swiftly away; abe sat down beside
rosemary.
‘why did you treat him so badly?’
‘did i?’ he asked surprised. ‘he’s been weeping around
here all morning.’
‘well, maybe he’s sad about something.’
‘maybe he is.’
‘what about a duel? who’s going to duel? i thought there
was something strange in that car. is it true?’
‘it certainly is coo-coo but it seems to be true.’

x
the trouble began at the time earl brady’s car passed the
divers’ car stopped on the road—abe’s account melted impersonally
into the thronged night—violet mckisco was
telling mrs. abrams something she had found out about
the divers—she had gone upstairs in their house and she
had come upon something there which had made a great
impression on her. but tommy is a watch-dog about the
divers. as a matter of fact she is inspiring and formidable—
but it’s a mutual thing, and the fact of the divers together is
more important to their friends than many of them realize.
of course it’s done at a certain sacrifice—sometimes they
seem just rather charming figures in a ballet, and worth just
the attention you give a ballet, but it’s more than that—you’d
have to know the story. anyhow tommy is one of those men
that dick’s passed along to nicole and when mrs. mckisco
kept hinting at her story, he called them on it. he said:
‘mrs. mckisco, please don’t talk further about mrs. diver.’
‘i wasn’t talking to you,’ she objected.
‘i think it’s better to leave them out.’
‘are they so sacred?’
‘leave them out. talk about something else.’
he was sitting on one of the two little seats beside campion.
campion told me the story.
66 tender is the night
‘well, you’re pretty high-handed,’ violet came back.
you know how conversations are in cars late at night,
some people murmuring and some not caring, giving up
after the party, or bored or asleep. well, none of them knew
just what happened until the car stopped and barban cried
in a voice that shook everybody, a voice for cavalry.
‘do you want to step out here—we’re only a mile from
the hotel and you can walk it or i’ll drag you there. you’ve
got to shut up and shut your wife up!’
‘you’re a bully,’ said mckisco. ‘you know you’re stronger
muscularly than i am. but i’m not afraid of you—what they
ought to have is the code duello—‘
there’s where he made his mistake because tommy, being
french, leaned over and clapped him one, and then the
chauffeur drove on. that was where you passed them. then
the women began. that was still the state of things when the
car got to the hotel.
tommy telephoned some man in cannes to act as second
and mckisco said he wasn’t going to be seconded by
campion, who wasn’t crazy for the job anyhow, so he telephoned
me not to say anything but to come right down.
violet mckisco collapsed and mrs. abrams took her to her
room and gave her a bromide whereupon she fell comfortably
asleep on the bed. when i got there i tried to argue with
tommy but the latter wouldn’t accept anything short of an
apology and mckisco rather spunkily wouldn’t give it.
when abe had finished rosemary asked thoughtfully:
‘do the divers know it was about them?’
‘no—and they’re not ever going to know they had any-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 67
thing to do with it. that damn campion had no business
talking to you about it, but since he did—i told the chauffeur
i’d get out the old musical saw if he opened his mouth
about it. this fight’s between two men—what tommy needs
is a good war.’
‘i hope the divers don’t find out,’ rosemary said.
abe peered at his watch.
‘i’ve got to go up and see mckisco—do you want to
come?—he feels sort of friendless—i bet he hasn’t slept.’
rosemary had a vision of the desperate vigil that highstrung,
badly organized man had probably kept. after a
moment balanced between pity and repugnance she agreed,
and full of morning energy, bounced upstairs beside abe.
mckisco was sitting on his bed with his alcoholic combativeness
vanished, in spite of the glass of champagne in
his hand. he seemed very puny and cross and white. evidently
he had been writing and drinking all night. he stared
confusedly at abe and rosemary and asked:
‘is it time?’
‘no, not for half an hour.’
the table was covered with papers which he assembled
with some difficulty into a long letter; the writing on the
last pages was very large and illegible. in the delicate light
of electric lamps fading, he scrawled his name at the bottom,
crammed it into an envelope and handed it to abe.
‘for my wife.’
‘you better souse your head in cold water,’ abe suggested.
‘you think i’d better?’ inquired mckisco doubtfully. ‘i 
68 tender is the night
don’t want to get too sober.’
‘well, you look terrible now.’
obediently mckisco went into the bathroom.
‘i’m leaving everything in an awful mess,’ he called. ‘i
don’t know how violet will get back to america. i don’t carry
any insurance. i never got around to it.’
‘don’t talk nonsense, you’ll be right here eating breakfast
in an hour.’
‘sure, i know.’ he came back with his hair wet and
looked at rosemary as if he saw her for the first time. suddenly
tears stood in his eyes. ‘i never have finished my novel.
that’s what makes me so sore. you don’t like me,’ he said to
rosemary, ‘but that can’t be helped. i’m primarily a literary
man.’ he made a vague discouraged sound and shook
his head helplessly. ‘i’ve made lots of mistakes in my life—
many of them. but i’ve been one of the most prominent—in
some ways—‘
he gave this up and puffed at a dead cigarette.
‘i do like you,’ said rosemary, ‘but i don’t think you
ought to fight a duel.’
‘yeah, i should have tried to beat him up, but it’s done
now. i’ve let myself be drawn into something that i had no
right to be. i have a very violent temper—‘ he looked closely
at abe as if he expected the statement to be challenged.
then with an aghast laugh he raised the cold cigarette butt
toward his mouth. his breathing quickened.
‘the trouble was i suggested the duel—if violet had only
kept her mouth shut i could have fixed it. of course even now
i can just leave, or sit back and laugh at the whole thing—
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 69
but i don’t think violet would ever respect me again.’
‘yes, she would,’ said rosemary. ‘she’d respect you
more.’
‘no—you don’t know violet. she’s very hard when she
gets an advantage over you. we’ve been married twelve
years, we had a little girl seven years old and she died and
after that you know how it is. we both played around on the
side a little, nothing serious but drifting apart—she called
me a coward out there tonight.’
troubled, rosemary didn’t answer.
‘well, we’ll see there’s as little damage done as possible,’
said abe. he opened the leather case. ‘these are barban’s
duelling pistols—i borrowed them so you could get familiar
with them. he carries them in his suitcase.’ he weighed
one of the archaic weapons in his hand. rosemary gave an
exclamation of uneasiness and mckisco looked at the pistols
anxiously.
‘well—it isn’t as if we were going to stand up and pot
each other with forty-fives,’ he said.
‘i don’t know,’ said abe cruelly; ‘the idea is you can sight
better along a long barrel.’
‘how about distance?’ asked mckisco.
‘i’ve inquired about that. if one or the other parties has to
be definitely eliminated they make it eight paces, if they’re
just good and sore it’s twenty paces, and if it’s only to vindicate
their honor it’s forty paces. his second agreed with me
to make it forty.’
‘that’s good.’
‘there’s a wonderful duel in a novel of pushkin’s,’ recol-
70 tender is the night
lected abe. ‘each man stood on the edge of a precipice, so if
he was hit at all he was done for.’
this seemed very remote and academic to mckisco, who
stared at him and said, ‘what?’
‘do you want to take a quick dip and freshen up?’
‘no—no, i couldn t swim.’ he sighed. ‘i don’t see what
it’s all about,’ he said helplessly. ‘i don’t see why i’m doing
it.’
it was the first thing he had ever done in his life. actually
he was one of those for whom the sensual world does
not exist, and faced with a concrete fact he brought to it a
vast surprise.
‘we might as well be going,’ said abe, seeing him fail a
little.
‘all right.’ he drank off a stiff drink of brandy, put
the flask in his pocket, and said with almost a savage air:
‘what’ll happen if i kill him—will they throw me in jail?’
‘i’ll run you over the italian border.’
he glanced at rosemary—and then said apologetically
to abe:
‘before we start there’s one thing i’d like to see you about
alone.’
‘i hope neither of you gets hurt,’ rosemary said. ‘i think
it’s very foolish and you ought to try to stop it.’

she found campion downstairs in the deserted lobby.
‘i saw you go upstairs,’ he said excitedly. ‘is he all right?
when is the duel going to be?’
‘i don’t know.’ she resented his speaking of it as a circus,
with mckisco as the tragic clown.
‘will you go with me?’ he demanded, with the air of having
seats. ‘i’ve hired the hotel car.’
‘i don’t want to go.’
‘why not? i imagine it’ll take years off my life but i
wouldn’t miss it for worlds. we could watch it from quite
far away.’
‘why don’t you get mr. dumphry to go with you?’
his monocle fell out, with no whiskers to hide in—he
drew himself up.
‘i never want to see him again.’
‘well, i’m afraid i can’t go. mother wouldn’t like it.’
as rosemary entered her room mrs. speers stirred sleepily
and called to her:
‘where’ve you been?’
‘i just couldn’t sleep. you go back to sleep, mother.’
‘come in my room.’ hearing her sit up in bed, rosemary
went in and told her what had happened.
‘why don’t you go and see it?’ mrs. speers suggested.
‘you needn’t go up close and you might be able to help af-
72 tender is the night
terwards.’
rosemary did not like the picture of herself looking on
and she demurred, but mrs. speer’s consciousness was still
clogged with sleep and she was reminded of night calls to
death and calamity when she was the wife of a doctor. ‘i like
you to go places and do things on your own initiative without
me—you did much harder things for rainy’s publicity
stunts.’
still rosemary did not see why she should go, but she
obeyed the sure, clear voice that had sent her into the stage
entrance of the odeon in paris when she was twelve and
greeted her when she came out again.
she thought she was reprieved when from the steps she
saw abe and mckisco drive away—but after a moment the
hotel car came around the corner. squealing delightedly
luis campion pulled her in beside him.
‘i hid there because they might not let us come. i’ve got
my movie camera, you see.’
she laughed helplessly. he was so terrible that he was no
longer terrible, only dehumanized.
‘i wonder why mrs. mckisco didn’t like the divers?’ she
said. ‘they were very nice to her.’
‘oh, it wasn’t that. it was something she saw. we never
did find exactly what it was because of barban.’
‘then that wasn’t what made you so sad.’
‘oh, no,’ he said, his voice breaking, ‘that was something
else that happened when we got back to the hotel. but now i
don’t care— i wash my hands of it completely.’
they followed the other car east along the shore past

juan les pins, where the skeleton of the new casino was
rising. it was past four and under a blue-gray sky the first
fishing boats were creaking out into a glaucous sea. then
they turned off the main road and into the back country.
‘it’s the golf course,’ cried campion, ‘i’m sure that’s where
it’s going to be.’
he was right. when abe’s car pulled up ahead of them
the east was crayoned red and yellow, promising a sultry
day. ordering the hotel car into a grove of pines rosemary
and campion kept in the shadow of a wood and skirted the
bleached fairway where abe and mckisco were walking
up and down, the latter raising his head at intervals like a
rabbit scenting. presently there were moving figures over
by a farther tee and the watchers made out barban and his
french second—the latter carried the box of pistols under
his arm.
somewhat appalled, mckisco slipped behind abe and
took a long swallow of brandy. he walked on choking and
would have marched directly up into the other party, but
abe stopped him and went forward to talk to the frenchman.
the sun was over the horizon.
campion grabbed rosemary’s arm.
‘i can’t stand it,’ he squeaked, almost voiceless. ‘it’s too
much. this will cost me—‘
‘let go,’ rosemary said peremptorily. she breathed a
frantic prayer in french.
the principals faced each other, barban with the sleeve
rolled up from his arm. his eyes gleamed restlessly in the
sun, but his motion was deliberate as he wiped his palm on 
74 tender is the night
the seam of his trousers. mckisco, reckless with brandy,
pursed his lips in a whistle and pointed his long nose about
nonchalantly, until abe stepped forward with a handkerchief
in his hand. the french second stood with his face
turned away. rosemary caught her breath in terrible pity
and gritted her teeth with hatred for barban; then:
‘one—two—three!’ abe counted in a strained voice.
they fired at the same moment. mckisco swayed but recovered
himself. both shots had missed.
‘now, that’s enough!’ cried abe.
the duellists walked in, and everyone looked at barban
inquiringly.
‘i declare myself unsatisfied.’
‘what? sure you’re satisfied,’ said abe impatiently. ‘you
just don’t know it.’
‘your man refuses another shot?’
‘you’re damn right, tommy. you insisted on this and my
client went through with it.’
tommy laughed scornfully.
‘the distance was ridiculous,’ he said. ‘i’m not accustomed
to such farces—your man must remember he’s not
now in america.’
‘no use cracking at america,’ said abe rather sharply.
and then, in a more conciliatory tone, ‘this has gone far
enough, tommy.’ they parleyed briskly for a moment—then
barban nodded and bowed coldly to his late antagonist.
‘no shake hand?’ suggested the french doctor.
‘they already know each other,’ said abe.
he turned to mckisco.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 75
‘come on, let’s get out.’
as they strode off, mckisco, in exultation, gripped his
arm.
‘wait a minute!’ abe said. ‘tommy wants his pistol back.
he might need it again.’
mckisco handed it over.
‘to hell with him,’ he said in a tough voice. ‘tell him he
can—‘
‘shall i tell him you want another shot?’
‘well, i did it,’ cried mckisco, as they went along. ‘and i
did it pretty well, didn’t i? i wasn’t yellow.’
‘you were pretty drunk,’ said abe bluntly.
‘no, i wasn’t.’
‘all right, then, you weren’t.’
‘why would it make any difference if i had a drink or
so?’
as his confidence mounted he looked resentfully at
abe.
‘what difference does that make?’ he repeated.
‘if you can’t see it, there’s no use going into it.’
‘don’t you know everybody was drunk all the time during
the war?’
‘well, let’s forget it.’
but the episode was not quite over. there were urgent
footsteps in the heather behind them and the doctor drew
up alongside.
‘pardon, messieurs,’ he panted. ‘voulez-vous regler mes
honorairies? naturellement c’est pour soins médicaux seulement.
m. barban n’a qu’un billet de mille et ne peut pas les 
76 tender is the night
régler et l’autre a laissé son porte-monnaie chez lui.’
‘trust a frenchman to think of that,’ said abe, and then
to the doctor. ‘combien?’
‘let me pay this,’ said mckisco.
‘no, i’ve got it. we were all in about the same danger.’
abe paid the doctor while mckisco suddenly turned into
the bushes and was sick there. then paler than before he
strutted on with abe toward the car through the now rosy
morning.
campion lay gasping on his back in the shrubbery, the
only casualty of the duel, while rosemary suddenly hysterical
with laughter kept kicking at him with her espadrille.
she did this persistently until she roused him—the only
matter of importance to her now was that in a few hours she
would see the person whom she still referred to in her mind
as ‘the divers’ on the beach.

they were at voisins waiting for nicole, six of them,
rosemary, the norths, dick diver and two young french
musicians. they were looking over the other patrons of the
restaurant to see if they had repose—dick said no american
men had any repose, except himself, and they were seeking
an example to confront him with. things looked black for
them—not a man had come into the restaurant for ten minutes
without raising his hand to his face.
‘we ought never to have given up waxed mustaches,’
said abe. ‘nevertheless dick isn’t the only man with repose—‘
‘oh, yes, i am.’
‘—but he may be the only sober man with repose.’
a well-dressed american had come in with two women
who swooped and fluttered unselfconsciously around a
table. suddenly, he perceived that he was being watched—
whereupon his hand rose spasmodically and arranged a
phantom bulge in his necktie. in another unseated party a
man endlessly patted his shaven cheek with his palm, and
his companion mechanically raised and lowered the stub of
a cold cigar. the luckier ones fingered eyeglasses and facial
hair, the unequipped stroked blank mouths, or even pulled
desperately at the lobes of their ears.
a well-known general came in, and abe, counting on the 
78 tender is the night
man’s first year at west point—that year during which no
cadet can resign and from which none ever recovers—made
a bet with dick of five dollars.
his hands hanging naturally at his sides, the general
waited to be seated. once his arms swung suddenly backward
like a jumper’s and dick said, ‘ah!’ supposing he had
lost control, but the general recovered and they breathed
again—the agony was nearly over, the garçon was pulling
out his chair ...
with a touch of fury the conqueror shot up his hand and
scratched his gray immaculate head.
‘you see,’ said dick smugly, ‘i’m the only one.’
rosemary was quite sure of it and dick, realizing that he
never had a better audience, made the group into so bright
a unit that rosemary felt an impatient disregard for all who
were not at their table. they had been two days in paris but
actually they were still under the beach umbrella. when, as
at the ball of the corps des pages the night before, the surroundings
seemed formidable to rosemary, who had yet to
attend a mayfair party in hollywood, dick would bring the
scene within range by greeting a few people, a sort of selection—the
divers seemed to have a large acquaintance, but
it was always as if the person had not seen them for a long,
long time, and was utterly bowled over, ‘why, where do you
keep yourselves?’—and then re-create the unity of his own
party by destroying the outsiders softly but permanently
with an ironic coup de grâce. presently rosemary seemed
to have known those people herself in some deplorable past,
and then got on to them, rejected them, discarded them.

their own party was overwhelmingly american and
sometimes scarcely american at all. it was themselves he
gave back to them, blurred by the compromises of how
many years.
into the dark, smoky restaurant, smelling of the rich raw
foods on the buffet, slid nicole’s sky-blue suit like a stray
segment of the weather outside. seeing from their eyes how
beautiful she was, she thanked them with a smile of radiant
appreciation. they were all very nice people for a while, very
courteous and all that. then they grew tired of it and they
were funny and bitter, and finally they made a lot of plans.
they laughed at things that they would not remember clearly
afterward—laughed a lot and the men drank three bottles
of wine. the trio of women at the table were representative
of the enormous flux of american life. nicole was the
granddaughter of a self-made american capitalist and the
granddaughter of a count of the house of lippe weissenfeld.
mary north was the daughter of a journeyman paper-hanger
and a descendant of president tyler. rosemary was from
the middle of the middle class, catapulted by her mother
onto the uncharted heights of hollywood. their point of resemblance
to each other and their difference from so many
american women, lay in the fact that they were all happy to
exist in a man’s world—they preserved their individuality
through men and not by opposition to them. they would
all three have made alternatively good courtesans or good
wives not by the accident of birth but through the greater
accident of finding their man or not finding him.
so rosemary found it a pleasant party, that luncheon, 
80 tender is the night
nicer in that there were only seven people, about the limit of
a good party. perhaps, too, the fact that she was new to their
world acted as a sort of catalytic agent to precipitate out all
their old reservations about one another. after the table
broke up, a waiter directed rosemary back into the dark
hinterland of all french restaurants, where she looked up
a phone number by a dim orange bulb, and called francoamerican
films. sure, they had a print of ‘daddy’s girl’—it
was out for the moment, but they would run it off later in
the week for her at 341 rue des saintes anges—ask for mr.
crowder.
the semi-booth gave on the vestiaire and as rosemary
hung up the receiver she heard two low voices not five feet
from her on the other side of a row of coats.
‘—so you love me?’
‘oh, do i!’
it was nicole—rosemary hesitated in the door of the
booth—then she heard dick say:
‘i want you terribly—let’s go to the hotel now.’ nicole
gave a little gasping sigh. for a moment the words conveyed
nothing at all to rosemary—but the tone did. the vast secretiveness
of it vibrated to herself.
‘i want you.’
‘i’ll be at the hotel at four.’
rosemary stood breathless as the voices moved away.
she was at first even astonished—she had seen them in their
relation to each other as people without personal exigencies—as
something cooler. now a strong current of emotion
flowed through her, profound and unidentified. she did not 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 81
know whether she was attracted or repelled, but only that
she was deeply moved. it made her feel very alone as she
went back into the restaurant, but it was touching to look
in upon, and the passionate gratitude of nicole’s ‘oh, do
i!’ echoed in her mind. the particular mood of the passage
she had witnessed lay ahead of her; but however far she was
from it her stomach told her it was all right—she had none
of the aversion she had felt in the playing of certain love
scenes in pictures.
being far away from it she nevertheless irrevocably participated
in it now, and shopping with nicole she was much
more conscious of the assignation than nicole herself. she
looked at nicole in a new way, estimating her attractions.
certainly she was the most attractive woman rosemary had
ever met—with her hardness, her devotions and loyalties,
and a certain elusiveness, which rosemary, thinking now
through her mother’s middle-class mind, associated with
her attitude about money. rosemary spent money she had
earned—she was here in europe due to the fact that she had
gone in the pool six times that january day with her temperature
roving from 99° in the early morning to 103°, when
her mother stopped it.
with nicole’s help rosemary bought two dresses and
two hats and four pairs of shoes with her money. nicole
bought from a great list that ran two pages, and bought the
things in the windows besides. everything she liked that
she couldn’t possibly use herself, she bought as a present for
a friend. she bought colored beads, folding beach cushions,
artificial flowers, honey, a guest bed, bags, scarfs, love birds, 
82 tender is the night
miniatures for a doll’s house and three yards of some new
cloth the color of prawns. she bought a dozen bathing suits,
a rubber alligator, a travelling chess set of gold and ivory, big
linen handkerchiefs for abe, two chamois leather jackets of
kingfisher blue and burning bush from hermes— bought
all these things not a bit like a high-class courtesan buying
underwear and jewels, which were after all professional
equipment and insurance—but with an entirely different
point of view. nicole was the product of much ingenuity and
toil. for her sake trains began their run at chicago and traversed
the round belly of the continent to california; chicle
factories fumed and link belts grew link by link in factories;
men mixed toothpaste in vats and drew mouthwash out of
copper hogsheads; girls canned tomatoes quickly in august
or worked rudely at the five-and-tens on christmas eve;
half-breed indians toiled on brazilian coffee plantations
and dreamers were muscled out of patent rights in new
tractors—these were some of the people who gave a tithe
to nicole, and as the whole system swayed and thundered
onward it lent a feverish bloom to such processes of hers
as wholesale buying, like the flush of a fireman’s face holding
his post before a spreading blaze. she illustrated very
simple principles, containing in herself her own doom, but
illustrated them so accurately that there was grace in the
procedure, and presently rosemary would try to imitate it.
it was almost four. nicole stood in a shop with a love bird
on her shoulder, and had one of her infrequent outbursts of
speech.
‘well, what if you hadn’t gone in that pool that day—i 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 83
sometimes wonder about such things. just before the war
we were in berlin—i was thirteen, it was just before mother
died. my sister was going to a court ball and she had three
of the royal princes on her dance card, all arranged by a
chamberlain and everything. half an hour before she was
going to start she had a side ache and a high fever. the doctor
said it was appendicitis and she ought to be operated
on. but mother had her plans made, so baby went to the
ball and danced till two with an ice pack strapped on under
her evening dress. she was operated on at seven o’clock
next morning.’
it was good to be hard, then; all nice people were hard
on themselves. but it was four o’clock and rosemary kept
thinking of dick waiting for nicole now at the hotel. she
must go there, she must not make him wait for her. she kept
thinking, ‘why don’t you go?’ and then suddenly, ‘or let me
go if you don’t want to.’ but nicole went to one more place
to buy corsages for them both and sent one to mary north.
only then she seemed to remember and with sudden abstraction
she signalled for a taxi.
‘good-by,’ said nicole. ‘we had fun, didn’t we?’
‘loads of fun,’ said rosemary. it was more difficult than
she thought and her whole self protested as nicole drove
away.

dick turned the corner of the traverse and continued
along the trench walking on the duckboard. he came to
a periscope, looked through it a moment; then he got up
on the step and peered over the parapet. in front of him
beneath a dingy sky was beaumont hamel; to his left the
tragic hill of thiepval. dick stared at them through his field
glasses, his throat straining with sadness.
he went on along the trench, and found the others waiting
for him in the next traverse. he was full of excitement
and he wanted to communicate it to them, to make them
understand about this, though actually abe north had seen
battle service and he had not.
‘this land here cost twenty lives a foot that summer,’ he
said to rosemary. she looked out obediently at the rather
bare green plain with its low trees of six years’ growth. if
dick had added that they were now being shelled she would
have believed him that afternoon. her love had reached a
point where now at last she was beginning to be unhappy,
to be desperate. she didn’t know what to do—she wanted to
talk to her mother.
‘there are lots of people dead since and we’ll all be dead
soon,’ said abe consolingly.
rosemary waited tensely for dick to continue.
‘see that little stream—we could walk to it in two min-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 85
utes. it took the british a month to walk to it—a whole
empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing
forward behind. and another empire walked very slowly
backward a few inches a day, leaving the dead like a million
bloody rugs. no europeans will ever do that again in this
generation.’
‘why, they’ve only just quit over in turkey,’ said abe.
‘and in morocco—‘
‘that’s different. this western-front business couldn’t
be done again, not for a long time. the young men think
they could do it but they couldn’t. they could fight the first
marne again but not this. this took religion and years of
plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that
existed between the classes. the russians and italians
weren’t any good on this front. you had to have a wholesouled
sentimental equipment going back further than you
could remember. you had to remember christmas, and
postcards of the crown prince and his fiancée, and little cafés
in valence and beer gardens in unter den linden and
weddings at the mairie, and going to the derby, and your
grandfather’s whiskers.’
‘general grant invented this kind of battle at petersburg
in sixtyfive.’
‘no, he didn’t—he just invented mass butchery. this kind
of battle was invented by lewis carroll and jules verne and
whoever wrote undine, and country deacons bowling and
marraines in marseilles and girls seduced in the back lanes
of wurtemburg and westphalia. why, this was a love battle—there
was a century of middle-class love spent here. 
86 tender is the night
this was the last love battle.’
‘you want to hand over this battle to d. h. lawrence,’
said abe.
‘all my beautiful lovely safe world blew itself up here
with a great gust of high explosive love,’ dick mourned persistently.
‘isn’t that true, rosemary?’
‘i don’t know,’ she answered with a grave face. ‘you know
everything.’
they dropped behind the others. suddenly a shower of
earth gobs and pebbles came down on them and abe yelled
from the next traverse:
‘the war spirit’s getting into me again. i have a hundred
years of ohio love behind me and i’m going to bomb out this
trench.’ his head popped up over the embankment. ‘you’re
dead—don’t you know the rules? that was a grenade.’
rosemary laughed and dick picked up a retaliatory
handful of stones and then put them down.
‘i couldn’t kid here,’ he said rather apologetically. ‘the
silver cord is cut and the golden bowl is broken and all that,
but an old romantic like me can’t do anything about it.’
‘i’m romantic too.’
they came out of the neat restored trench, and faced a
memorial to the newfoundland dead. reading the inscription
rosemary burst into sudden tears. like most women
she liked to be told how she should feel, and she liked dick’s
telling her which things were ludicrous and which things
were sad. but most of all she wanted him to know how she
loved him, now that the fact was upsetting everything,
now that she was walking over the battlefield in a thrilling 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 87
dream.
after that they got in their car and started back toward
amiens. a thin warm rain was falling on the new scrubby
woods and underbrush and they passed great funeral pyres
of sorted duds, shells, bombs, grenades, and equipment,
helmets, bayonets, gun stocks and rotten leather, abandoned
six years in the ground. and suddenly around a bend
the white caps of a great sea of graves. dick asked the chauffeur
to stop.
‘there’s that girl—and she still has her wreath.’
they watched as he got out and went over to the girl, who
stood uncertainly by the gate with a wreath in her hand.
her taxi waited. she was a red-haired girl from tennessee
whom they had met on the train this morning, come from
knoxville to lay a memorial on her brother’s grave. there
were tears of vexation on her face.
‘the war department must have given me the wrong
number,’ she whimpered. ‘it had another name on it. i been
lookin’ for it since two o’clock, and there’s so many graves.’
‘then if i were you i’d just lay it on any grave without
looking at the name,’ dick advised her.
‘you reckon that’s what i ought to do?’
‘i think that’s what he’d have wanted you to do.’
it was growing dark and the rain was coming down
harder.
she left the wreath on the first grave inside the gate, and
accepted dick’s suggestion that she dismiss her taxi-cab
and ride back to amiens with them.
rosemary shed tears again when she heard of the mis-
88 tender is the night
hap—altogether it had been a watery day, but she felt that
she had learned something, though exactly what it was she
did not know. later she remembered all the hours of the afternoon
as happy—one of those uneventful times that seem
at the moment only a link between past and future pleasure
but turn out to have been the pleasure itself.
amiens was an echoing purple town, still sad with the
war, as some railroad stations were:—the gare du nord and
waterloo station in london. in the daytime one is deflated
by such towns, with their little trolley cars of twenty years
ago crossing the great gray cobble-stoned squares in front of
the cathedral, and the very weather seems to have a quality
of the past, faded weather like that of old photographs. but
after dark all that is most satisfactory in french life swims
back into the picture—the sprightly tarts, the men arguing
with a hundred voilàs in the cafés, the couples drifting,
head to head, toward the satisfactory inexpensiveness of nowhere.
waiting for the train they sat in a big arcade, tall
enough to release the smoke and chatter and music upward
and obligingly the orchestra launched into ‘yes, we have
no bananas,’—they clapped, because the leader looked so
pleased with himself. the tennessee girl forgot her sorrow
and enjoyed herself, even began flirtations of tropical eyerollings
and pawings, with dick and abe. they teased her
gently.
then, leaving infinitesimal sections of wurtemburgers,
prussian guards, chasseurs alpins, manchester mill
hands and old etonians to pursue their eternal dissolution
under the warm rain, they took the train for paris. they ate 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 89
sandwiches of mortadel sausage and bel paese cheese made
up in the station restaurant, and drank beaujolais. nicole
was abstracted, biting her lip restlessly and reading over
the guide-books to the battle-field that dick had brought
along—indeed, he had made a quick study of the whole affair,
simplifying it always until it bore a faint resemblance to
one of his own parties.
90 tender is the night
xiv
when they reached paris nicole was too tired to go on to
the grand illumination at the decorative art exposition as
they had planned. they left her at the hotel roi george, and
as she disappeared between the intersecting planes made by
lobby lights of the glass doors, rosemary’s oppression lifted.
nicole was a force—not necessarily well disposed or predictable
like her mother—an incalculable force. rosemary
was somewhat afraid of her.
at eleven she sat with dick and the norths at a houseboat
café just opened on the seine. the river shimmered
with lights from the bridges and cradled many cold moons.
on sundays sometimes when rosemary and her mother
had lived in paris they had taken the little steamer up to
suresnes and talked about plans for the future. they had little
money but mrs. speers was so sure of rosemary’s beauty
and had implanted in her so much ambition, that she was
willing to gamble the money on ‘advantages”; rosemary in
turn was to repay her mother when she got her start... .
since reaching paris abe north had had a thin vinous
fur over him; his eyes were bloodshot from sun and wine.
rosemary realized for the first time that he was always stopping
in places to get a drink, and she wondered how mary
north liked it. mary was quiet, so quiet save for her frequent
laughter that rosemary had learned little about her. 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 91
she liked the straight dark hair brushed back until it met
some sort of natural cascade that took care of it— from time
to time it eased with a jaunty slant over the corner of her
temple, until it was almost in her eye when she tossed her
head and caused it to fall sleek into place once more.
‘we’ll turn in early to-night, abe, after this drink.’
mary’s voice was light but it held a little flicker of anxiety.
‘you don’t want to be poured on the boat.’
‘it’s pretty late now,’ dick said. ‘we’d all better go.’
the noble dignity of abe’s face took on a certain stubbornness,
and he remarked with determination:
‘oh, no.’ he paused gravely. ‘oh, no, not yet. we’ll have
another bottle of champagne.’
‘no more for me,’ said dick.
‘it’s rosemary i’m thinking of. she’s a natural alcoholic—keeps
a bottle of gin in the bathroom and all that—her
mother told me.’
he emptied what was left of the first bottle into rosemary’s
glass. she had made herself quite sick the first day
in paris with quarts of lemonade; after that she had taken
nothing with them but now she raised the champagne and
drank at it.
‘but what’s this?’ exclaimed dick. ‘you told me you didn’t
drink.’
‘i didn’t say i was never going to.’
‘what about your mother?’
‘i’m just going to drink this one glass.’ she felt some necessity
for it. dick drank, not too much, but he drank, and
perhaps it would bring her closer to him, be a part of the 
92 tender is the night
equipment for what she had to do. she drank it quickly,
choked and then said, ‘besides, yesterday was my birthday—i
was eighteen.’
‘why didn’t you tell us?’ they said indignantly.
‘i knew you’d make a fuss over it and go to a lot of trouble.’
she finished the champagne. ‘so this is the celebration.’
‘it most certainly is not,’ dick assured her. ‘the dinner
tomorrow night is your birthday party and don’t forget it.
eighteen—why that’s a terribly important age.’
‘i used to think until you’re eighteen nothing matters,’
said mary.
‘that’s right,’ abe agreed. ‘and afterward it’s the same
way.’
‘abe feels that nothing matters till he gets on the boat,’
said mary. ‘this time he really has got everything planned
out when he gets to new york.’ she spoke as though she were
tired of saying things that no longer had a meaning for her,
as if in reality the course that she and her husband followed,
or failed to follow, had become merely an intention.
‘he’ll be writing music in america and i’ll be working at
singing in munich, so when we get together again there’ll be
nothing we can’t do.’
‘that’s wonderful,’ agreed rosemary, feeling the champagne.
‘meanwhile, another touch of champagne for rosemary.
then she’ll be more able to rationalize the acts of her lymphatic
glands. they only begin to function at eighteen.’
dick laughed indulgently at abe, whom he loved, and in
whom he had long lost hope: ‘that’s medically incorrect and 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 93
we’re going.’ catching the faint patronage abe said lightly:
‘something tells me i’ll have a new score on broadway
long before you’ve finished your scientific treatise.’
‘i hope so,’ said dick evenly. ‘i hope so. i may even abandon
what you call my ‘scientific treatise.’’
‘oh, dick!’ mary’s voice was startled, was shocked.
rosemary had never before seen dick’s face utterly expressionless;
she felt that this announcement was something
momentous and she was inclined to exclaim with mary ‘oh,
dick!’
but suddenly dick laughed again, added to his remark
‘—abandon it for another one,’ and got up from the table.
‘but dick, sit down. i want to know—‘
‘i’ll tell you some time. good night, abe. good night,
mary.’
‘good night, dear dick.’ mary smiled as if she were going
to be perfectly happy sitting there on the almost deserted
boat. she was a brave, hopeful woman and she was following
her husband somewhere, changing herself to this kind
of person or that, without being able to lead him a step out
of his path, and sometimes realizing with discouragement
how deep in him the guarded secret of her direction lay.
and yet an air of luck clung about her, as if she were a sort
of token... .
94 tender is the night

‘what is it you are giving up?’ demanded rosemary, facing
dick earnestly in the taxi.
‘nothing of importance.’
‘are you a scientist?’
‘i’m a doctor of medicine.’
‘oh-h!’ she smiled delightedly. ‘my father was a doctor
too. then why don’t you—‘ she stopped.
‘there’s no mystery. i didn’t disgrace myself at the height
of my career, and hide away on the riviera. i’m just not practising.
you can’t tell, i’ll probably practise again some day.’
rosemary put up her face quietly to be kissed. he looked
at her for a moment as if he didn’t understand. then holding
her in the hollow of his arm he rubbed his cheek against her
cheek’s softness, and then looked down at her for another
long moment.
‘such a lovely child,’ he said gravely.
she smiled up at him; her hands playing conventionally
with the lapels of his coat. ‘i’m in love with you and nicole.
actually that’s my secret—i can’t even talk about you
to anybody because i don’t want any more people to know
how wonderful you are. honestly—i love you and nicole—i
do.’
—so many times he had heard this—even the formula
was the same.

suddenly she came toward him, her youth vanishing as
she passed inside the focus of his eyes and he had kissed her
breathlessly as if she were any age at all. then she lay back
against his arm and sighed.
‘i’ve decided to give you up,’ she said.
dick started—had he said anything to imply that she
possessed any part of him?
‘but that’s very mean,’ he managed to say lightly, ‘just
when i was getting interested.’
‘i’ve loved you so—‘ as if it had been for years. she was
weeping a little now. ‘i’ve loved you so-o-o.’
then he should have laughed, but he heard himself saying,
‘not only are you beautiful but you are somehow on the
grand scale. everything you do, like pretending to be in love
or pretending to be shy gets across.’
in the dark cave of the taxi, fragrant with the perfume
rosemary had bought with nicole, she came close again,
clinging to him. he kissed her without enjoying it. he knew
that there was passion there, but there was no shadow of it
in her eyes or on her mouth; there was a faint spray of champagne
on her breath. she clung nearer desperately and once
more he kissed her and was chilled by the innocence of her
kiss, by the glance that at the moment of contact looked beyond
him out into the darkness of the night, the darkness
of the world. she did not know yet that splendor is something
in the heart; at the moment when she realized that
and melted into the passion of the universe he could take
her without question or regret.
her room in the hotel was diagonally across from theirs 
96 tender is the night
and nearer the elevator. when they reached the door she
said suddenly:
‘i know you don’t love me—i don’t expect it. but you said
i should have told you about my birthday. well, i did, and
now for my birthday present i want you to come into my
room a minute while i tell you something. just one minute.’
they went in and he closed the door, and rosemary
stood close to him, not touching him. the night had drawn
the color from her face—she was pale as pale now, she was a
white carnation left after a dance.
‘when you smile—‘ he had recovered his paternal attitude,
perhaps because of nicole’s silent proximity, ‘i always
think i’ll see a gap where you’ve lost some baby teeth.’
but he was too late—she came close up against him with
a forlorn whisper.
‘take me.’
‘take you where?’
astonishment froze him rigid.
‘go on,’ she whispered. ‘oh, please go on, whatever they
do. i don’t care if i don’t like it—i never expected to—i’ve always
hated to think about it but now i don’t. i want you to.’
she was astonished at herself—she had never imagined
she could talk like that. she was calling on things she had
read, seen, dreamed through a decade of convent hours.
suddenly she knew too that it was one of her greatest rôles
and she flung herself into it more passionately.
‘this is not as it should be,’ dick deliberated. ‘isn’t it just
the champagne? let’s more or less forget it.’

‘oh, no, now. i want you to do it now, take me, show
me, i’m absolutely yours and i want to be.’
‘for one thing, have you thought how much it would
hurt nicole?’
‘she won’t know—this won’t have anything to do with
her.’
he continued kindly.
‘then there’s the fact that i love nicole.’
‘but you can love more than just one person, can’t you?
like i love mother and i love you—more. i love you more
now.’
‘—the fourth place you’re not in love with me but you
might be afterwards, and that would begin your life with a
terrible mess.’
‘no, i promise i’ll never see you again. i’ll get mother
and go to america right away.’
he dismissed this. he was remembering too vividly the
youth and freshness of her lips. he took another tone.
‘you’re just in that mood.’
‘oh, please, i don’t care even if i had a baby. i could go
into mexico like a girl at the studio. oh, this is so different
from anything i ever thought—i used to hate it when they
kissed me seriously.’ he saw she was still under the impression
that it must happen. ‘some of them had great big teeth,
but you’re all different and beautiful. i want you to do it.’
‘i believe you think people just kiss some way and you
want me to kiss you.’
‘oh, don’t tease me—i’m not a baby. i know you’re not in
love with me.’ she was suddenly humble and quiet. ‘i didn’t 
98 tender is the night
expect that much. i know i must seem just nothing to you.’
‘nonsense. but you seem young to me.’ his thoughts
added, ‘— there’d be so much to teach you.’
rosemary waited, breathing eagerly till dick said: ‘and
lastly things aren’t arranged so that this could be as you
want.’
her face drooped with dismay and disappointment and
dick said automatically, ‘we’ll have to simply—‘ he stopped
himself, followed her to the bed, sat down beside her while
she wept. he was suddenly confused, not about the ethics of
the matter, for the impossibility of it was sheerly indicated
from all angles but simply confused, and for a moment his
usual grace, the tensile strength of his balance, was absent.
‘i knew you wouldn’t,’ she sobbed. ‘it was just a forlorn
hope.’
he stood up.
‘good night, child. this is a damn shame. let’s drop it
out of the picture.’ he gave her two lines of hospital patter
to go to sleep on. ‘so many people are going to love you and
it might be nice to meet your first love all intact, emotionally
too. that’s an old-fashioned idea, isn’t it?’ she looked
up at him as he took a step toward the door; she looked at
him without the slightest idea as to what was in his head,
she saw him take another step in slow motion, turn and
look at her again, and she wanted for a moment to hold him
and devour him, wanted his mouth, his ears, his coat collar,
wanted to surround him and engulf him; she saw his hand
fall on the doorknob. then she gave up and sank back on the
bed. when the door closed she got up and went to the mir-

she woke up cooled and shamed. the sight of her beauty
in the mirror did not reassure her but only awakened the
ache of yesterday and a letter, forwarded by her mother,
from the boy who had taken her to the yale prom last fall,
which announced his presence in paris was no help—all
that seemed far away. she emerged from her room for the
ordeal of meeting the divers weighted with a double trouble.
but it was hidden by a sheath as impermeable as nicole’s
when they met and went together to a series of fittings. it
was consoling, though, when nicole remarked, apropos of
a distraught saleswoman: ‘most people think everybody
feels about them much more violently than they actually
do—they think other people’s opinions of them swing
through great arcs of approval or disapproval.’ yesterday
in her expansiveness rosemary would have resented that
remark—to-day in her desire to minimize what had happened
she welcomed it eagerly. she admired nicole for her
beauty and her wisdom, and also for the first time in her
life she was jealous. just before leaving gausse’s hotel her
mother had said in that casual tone, which rosemary knew
concealed her most significant opinions, that nicole was a
great beauty, with the frank implication that rosemary was
not. this did not bother rosemary, who had only recently
been allowed to learn that she was even personable; so that 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 101
her prettiness never seemed exactly her own but rather an
acquirement, like her french. nevertheless, in the taxi she
looked at nicole, matching herself against her. there were
all the potentialities for romantic love in that lovely body
and in the delicate mouth, sometimes tight, sometimes expectantly
half open to the world. nicole had been a beauty
as a young girl and she would be a beauty later when her
skin stretched tight over her high cheekbones—the essential
structure was there. she had been white-saxon-blonde
but she was more beautiful now that her hair had darkened
than when it had been like a cloud and more beautiful than
she.
‘we lived there,’ rosemary suddenly pointed to a building
in the rue des saints-péres.
‘that’s strange. because when i was twelve mother and
baby and i once spent a winter there,’ and she pointed to a
hotel directly across the street. the two dingy fronts stared
at them, gray echoes of girlhood.
‘we’d just built our lake forest house and we were economizing,’
nicole continued. ‘at least baby and i and the
governess economized and mother travelled.’
‘we were economizing too,’ said rosemary, realizing
that the word meant different things to them.
‘mother always spoke of it very carefully as a small hotel—‘
nicole gave her quick magnetic little laugh, ‘—i mean
instead of saying a ‘cheap’ hotel. if any swanky friends
asked us our address we’d never say, ‘we’re in a dingy little
hole over in the apache quarter where we’re glad of running
water,’—we’d say ‘we’re in a small hotel.’ as if all the 
102 tender is the night
big ones were too noisy and vulgar for us. of course the
friends always saw through us and told everyone about it,
but mother always said it showed we knew our way around
europe. she did, of course: she was born a german citizen.
but her mother was american, and she was brought up in
chicago, and she was more american than european.’
they were meeting the others in two minutes, and rosemary
reconstructed herself once more as they got out of the
taxi in the rue guynemer, across from the luxembourg
gardens. they were lunching in the norths’ already dismantled
apartment high above the green mass of leaves. the
day seemed different to rosemary from the day before—
when she saw him face to face their eyes met and brushed
like birds’ wings. after that everything was all right, everything
was wonderful, she knew that he was beginning to
fall in love with her. she felt wildly happy, felt the warm sap
of emotion being pumped through her body. a cool, clear
confidence deepened and sang in her. she scarcely looked at
dick but she knew everything was all right.
after luncheon the divers and the norths and rosemary
went to the franco-american films, to be joined by collis
clay, her young man from new haven, to whom she had
telephoned. he was a georgian, with the peculiarly regular,
even stencilled ideas of southerners who are educated in the
north. last winter she had thought him attractive—once
they held hands in an automobile going from new haven to
new york; now he no longer existed for her.
in the projection room she sat between collis clay and
dick while the mechanic mounted the reels of daddy’s girl 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 103
and a french executive fluttered about her trying to talk
american slang. ‘yes, boy,’ he said when there was trouble
with the projector, ‘i have not any benenas.’ then the lights
went out, there was the sudden click and a flickering noise
and she was alone with dick at last. they looked at each
other in the half darkness.
‘dear rosemary,’ he murmured. their shoulders
touched. nicole stirred restlessly at the end of the row and
abe coughed convulsively and blew his nose; then they all
settled down and the picture ran.
there she was—the school girl of a year ago, hair down
her back and rippling out stiffly like the solid hair of a tanagra
figure; there she was—so young and innocent—the
product of her mother’s loving care; there she was—embodying
all the immaturity of the race, cutting a new
cardboard paper doll to pass before its empty harlot’s mind.
she remembered how she had felt in that dress, especially
fresh and new under the fresh young silk.
daddy’s girl. was it a ‘itty-bitty bravekins and did it suffer?
ooo-ooo-tweet, de tweetest thing, wasn’t she dest too
tweet? before her tiny fist the forces of lust and corruption
rolled away; nay, the very march of destiny stopped; inevitable
became evitable, syllogism, dialectic, all rationality fell
away. women would forget the dirty dishes at home and
weep, even within the picture one woman wept so long that
she almost stole the film away from rosemary. she wept all
over a set that cost a fortune, in a duncan phyfe diningroom,
in an aviation port, and during a yacht-race that was
only used in two flashes, in a subway and finally in a bath-
104 tender is the night
room. but rosemary triumphed. her fineness of character,
her courage and steadfastness intruded upon by the vulgarity
of the world, and rosemary showing what it took with
a face that had not yet become mask-like—yet it was actually
so moving that the emotions of the whole row of people
went out to her at intervals during the picture. there was
a break once and the light went on and after the chatter of
applause dick said to her sincerely: ‘i’m simply astounded.
you’re going to be one of the best actresses on the stage.’
then back to daddy’s girl: happier days now, and a lovely
shot of rosemary and her parent united at the last in a father
complex so apparent that dick winced for all psychologists
at the vicious sentimentality. the screen vanished, the lights
went on, the moment had come.
‘i’ve arranged one other thing,’ announced rosemary to
the company at large, ‘i’ve arranged a test for dick.’
‘a what?’
‘a screen test, they’ll take one now.’
there was an awful silence—then an irrepressible chortle
from the norths. rosemary watched dick comprehend
what she meant, his face moving first in an irish way; simultaneously
she realized that she had made some mistake in
the playing of her trump and still she did not suspect that
the card was at fault.
‘i don’t want a test,’ said dick firmly; then, seeing the
situation as a whole, he continued lightly, ‘rosemary, i’m
disappointed. the pictures make a fine career for a woman—but
my god, they can’t photograph me. i’m an old
scientist all wrapped up in his private life.’

nicole and mary urged him ironically to seize the opportunity;
they teased him, both faintly annoyed at not having
been asked for a sitting. but dick closed the subject with a
somewhat tart discussion of actors: ‘the strongest guard is
placed at the gateway to nothing,’ he said. ‘maybe because
the condition of emptiness is too shameful to be divulged.’
in the taxi with dick and collis clay—they were dropping
collis, and dick was taking rosemary to a tea from
which nicole and the norths had resigned in order to do the
things abe had left undone till the last—in the taxi rosemary
reproached him.
‘i thought if the test turned out to be good i could take it
to california with me. and then maybe if they liked it you’d
come out and be my leading man in a picture.’
he was overwhelmed. ‘it was a darn sweet thought, but
i’d rather look at you. you were about the nicest sight i
ever looked at.’
‘that’s a great picture,’ said collis. ‘i’ve seen it four times.
i know one boy at new haven who’s seen it a dozen times—
he went all the way to hartford to see it one time. and when
i brought rosemary up to new haven he was so shy he
wouldn’t meet her. can you beat that? this little girl knocks
them cold.’
dick and rosemary looked at each other, wanting to be
alone, but collis failed to understand.
‘i’ll drop you where you’re going,’ he suggested. ‘i’m staying
at the lutetia.’
‘we’ll drop you,’ said dick.
‘it’ll be easier for me to drop you. no trouble at all.’
106 tender is the night
‘i think it will be better if we drop you.’
‘but—‘ began collis; he grasped the situation at last and
began discussing with rosemary when he would see her
again.
finally, he was gone, with the shadowy unimportance
but the offensive bulk of the third party. the car stopped
unexpectedly, unsatisfactorily, at the address dick had given.
he drew a long breath.
‘shall we go in?’
‘i don’t care,’ rosemary said. ‘i’ll do anything you want.’
he considered.
‘i almost have to go in—she wants to buy some pictures
from a friend of mine who needs the money.’
rosemary smoothed the brief expressive disarray of her
hair.
‘we’ll stay just five minutes,’ he decided. ‘you’re not going
to like these people.’
she assumed that they were dull and stereotyped people,
or gross and drunken people, or tiresome, insistent people,
or any of the sorts of people that the divers avoided. she
was entirely unprepared for the impression that the scene
made on her.

it was a house hewn from the frame of cardinal de retz’s
palace in the rue monsieur, but once inside the door there
was nothing of the past, nor of any present that rosemary
knew. the outer shell, the masonry, seemed rather to enclose
the future so that it was an electric-like shock, a definite
nervous experience, perverted as a breakfast of oatmeal
and hashish, to cross that threshold, if it could be so called,
into the long hall of blue steel, silver-gilt, and the myriad
facets of many oddly bevelled mirrors. the effect was unlike
that of any part of the decorative arts exhibition—for
there were people in it, not in front of it. rosemary had the
detached false-and-exalted feeling of being on a set and she
guessed that every one else present had that feeling too.
there were about thirty people, mostly women, and all
fashioned by louisa m. alcott or madame de ségur; and
they functioned on this set as cautiously, as precisely, as
does a human hand picking up jagged broken glass. neither
individually nor as a crowd could they be said to dominate
the environment, as one comes to dominate a work of
art he may possess, no matter how esoteric, no one knew
what this room meant because it was evolving into something
else, becoming everything a room was not; to exist
in it was as difficult as walking on a highly polished moving
stairway, and no one could succeed at all save with the 
108 tender is the night
aforementioned qualities of a hand moving among broken
glass—which qualities limited and defined the majority of
those present.
these were of two sorts. there were the americans and
english who had been dissipating all spring and summer,
so that now everything they did had a purely nervous inspiration.
they were very quiet and lethargic at certain hours
and then they exploded into sudden quarrels and breakdowns
and seductions. the other class, who might be called
the exploiters, was formed by the sponges, who were sober,
serious people by comparison, with a purpose in life and no
time for fooling. these kept their balance best in that environment,
and what tone there was, beyond the apartment’s
novel organization of light values, came from them.
the frankenstein took down dick and rosemary at a
gulp—it separated them immediately and rosemary suddenly
discovered herself to be an insincere little person,
living all in the upper registers of her throat and wishing the
director would come. there was however such a wild beating
of wings in the room that she did not feel her position
was more incongruous than any one else’s. in addition, her
training told and after a series of semi-military turns, shifts,
and marches she found herself presumably talking to a neat,
slick girl with a lovely boy’s face, but actually absorbed by a
conversation taking place on a sort of gun-metal ladder diagonally
opposite her and four feet away.
there was a trio of young women sitting on the bench.
they were all tall and slender with small heads groomed
like manikins’ heads, and as they talked the heads waved 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 109
gracefully about above their dark tailored suits, rather like
long-stemmed flowers and rather like cobras’ hoods.
‘oh, they give a good show,’ said one of them, in a deep
rich voice. ‘practically the best show in paris—i’d be the last
one to deny that. but after all—‘ she sighed. ‘those phrases
he uses over and over—‘oldest inhabitant gnawed by rodents.’
you laugh once.’
‘i prefer people whose lives have more corrugated surfaces,’
said the second, ‘and i don’t like her.’
‘i’ve never really been able to get very excited about them,
or their entourage either. why, for example, the entirely liquid
mr. north?’
‘he’s out,’ said the first girl. ‘but you must admit that the
party in question can be one of the most charming human
beings you have ever met.’
it was the first hint rosemary had had that they were
talking about the divers, and her body grew tense with indignation.
but the girl talking to her, in the starched blue
shirt with the bright blue eyes and the red cheeks and the
very gray suit, a poster of a girl, had begun to play up. desperately
she kept sweeping things from between them, afraid
that rosemary couldn’t see her, sweeping them away until
presently there was not so much as a veil of brittle humor
hiding the girl, and with distaste rosemary saw her plain.
‘couldn’t you have lunch, or maybe dinner, or lunch
the day after?’ begged the girl. rosemary looked about for
dick, finding him with the hostess, to whom he had been
talking since they came in. their eyes met and he nodded
slightly, and simultaneously the three cobra women noticed 
110 tender is the night
her; their long necks darted toward her and they fixed finely
critical glances upon her. she looked back at them defiantly,
acknowledging that she had heard what they said. then she
threw off her exigent vis-à-vis with a polite but clipped parting
that she had just learned from dick, and went over to
join him. the hostess—she was another tall rich american
girl, promenading insouciantly upon the national prosperity—was
asking dick innumerable questions about gausse’s
hôtel, whither she evidently wanted to come, and battering
persistently against his reluctance. rosemary’s presence reminded
her that she had been recalcitrant as a hostess and
glancing about she said: ‘have you met any one amusing,
have you met mr.—‘ her eyes groped for a male who might
interest rosemary, but dick said they must go. they left immediately,
moving over the brief threshold of the future to
the sudden past of the stone façade without.
‘wasn’t it terrible?’ he said.
‘terrible,’ she echoed obediently.
‘rosemary?’
she murmured, ‘what?’ in an awed voice.
‘i feel terribly about this.’
she was shaken with audibly painful sobs. ‘have you got
a handkerchief?’ she faltered. but there was little time to
cry, and lovers now they fell ravenously on the quick seconds
while outside the taxi windows the green and cream
twilight faded, and the firered, gas-blue, ghost-green
signs began to shine smokily through the tranquil rain. it
was nearly six, the streets were in movement, the bistros
gleamed, the place de la concorde moved by in pink maj-

esty as the cab turned north.
they looked at each other at last, murmuring names that
were a spell. softly the two names lingered on the air, died
away more slowly than other words, other names, slower
than music in the mind.
‘i don’t know what came over me last night,’ rosemary
said. ‘that glass of champagne? i’ve never done anything
like that before.’
‘you simply said you loved me.’
‘i do love you—i can’t change that.’ it was time for rosemary
to cry, so she cried a little in her handkerchief.
‘i’m afraid i’m in love with you,’ said dick, ‘and that’s not
the best thing that could happen.’
again the names—then they lurched together as if the
taxi had swung them. her breasts crushed flat against him,
her mouth was all new and warm, owned in common. they
stopped thinking with an almost painful relief, stopped seeing;
they only breathed and sought each other. they were
both in the gray gentle world of a mild hangover of fatigue
when the nerves relax in bunches like piano strings, and
crackle suddenly like wicker chairs. nerves so raw and
tender must surely join other nerves, lips to lips, breast to
breast... .
they were still in the happier stage of love. they were full
of brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions,
so that the communion of self with self seemed to be on a
plane where no other human relations mattered. they both
seemed to have arrived there with an extraordinary innocence
as though a series of pure accidents had driven them 
112 tender is the night
together, so many accidents that at last they were forced to
conclude that they were for each other. they had arrived
with clean hands, or so it seemed, after no traffic with the
merely curious and clandestine.
but for dick that portion of the road was short; the turning
came before they reached the hotel.
‘there’s nothing to do about it,’ he said, with a feeling of
panic. ‘i’m in love with you but it doesn’t change what i said
last night.’
‘that doesn’t matter now. i just wanted to make you love
me—if you love me everything’s all right.’
‘unfortunately i do. but nicole mustn’t know—she
mustn’t suspect even faintly. nicole and i have got to go on
together. in a way that’s more important than just wanting
to go on.’
‘kiss me once more.’
he kissed her, but momentarily he had left her.
‘nicole mustn’t suffer—she loves me and i love her—you
understand that.’
she did understand—it was the sort of thing she understood
well, not hurting people. she knew the divers loved
each other because it had been her primary assumption. she
had thought however that it was a rather cooled relation,
and actually rather like the love of herself and her mother.
when people have so much for outsiders didn’t it indicate a
lack of inner intensity?
‘and i mean love,’ he said, guessing her thoughts. ‘active
love— it’s more complicated than i can tell you. it was responsible
for that crazy duel.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 113
‘how did you know about the duel? i thought we were to
keep it from you.’
‘do you think abe can keep a secret?’ he spoke with
incisive irony. ‘tell a secret over the radio, publish it in a
tabloid, but never tell it to a man who drinks more than
three or four a day.’
she laughed in agreement, staying close to him.
‘so you understand my relations with nicole are complicated.
she’s not very strong—she looks strong but she isn’t.
and this makes rather a mess.’
‘oh, say that later! but kiss me now—love me now. i’ll
love you and never let nicole see.’
‘you darling.’
they reached the hotel and rosemary walked a little behind
him, to admire him, to adore him. his step was alert as
if he had just come from some great doings and was hurrying
on toward others. organizer of private gaiety, curator of
a richly incrusted happiness. his hat was a perfect hat and
he carried a heavy stick and yellow gloves. she thought what
a good time they would all have being with him to-night.
they walked upstairs—five flights. at the first landing
they stopped and kissed; she was careful on the next landing,
on the third more careful still. on the next—there were
two more—she stopped half way and kissed him fleetingly
good-by. at his urgency she walked down with him to the
one below for a minute—and then up and up. finally it was
good-by with their hands stretching to touch along the diagonal
of the banister and then the fingers slipping apart.
dick went back downstairs to make some arrangements for 
114 tender is the night
the evening—rosemary ran to her room and wrote a letter
to her mother; she was conscience-stricken because she did
not miss her mother at all.

although the divers were honestly apathetic to organized
fashion, they were nevertheless too acute to abandon
its contemporaneous rhythm and beat—dick’s parties were
all concerned with excitement, and a chance breath of fresh
night air was the more precious for being experienced in the
intervals of the excitement.
the party that night moved with the speed of a slapstick
comedy. they were twelve, they were sixteen, they
were quartets in separate motors bound on a quick odyssey
over paris. everything had been foreseen. people joined
them as if by magic, accompanied them as specialists, almost
guides, through a phase of the evening, dropped out
and were succeeded by other people, so that it appeared as
if the freshness of each one had been husbanded for them
all day. rosemary appreciated how different it was from any
party in hollywood, no matter how splendid in scale. there
was, among many diversions, the car of the shah of persia.
where dick had commandeered this vehicle, what bribery
was employed, these were facts of irrelevance. rosemary accepted
it as merely a new facet of the fabulous, which for
two years had filled her life. the car had been built on a special
chassis in america. its wheels were of silver, so was the
radiator. the inside of the body was inlaid with innumerable
brilliants which would be replaced with true gems by the 
116 tender is the night
court jeweller when the car arrived in teheran the following
week. there was only one real seat in back, because the shah
must ride alone, so they took turns riding in it and sitting
on the marten fur that covered the floor.
but always there was dick. rosemary assured the image
of her mother, ever carried with her, that never, never had
she known any one so nice, so thoroughly nice as dick was
that night. she compared him with the two englishmen,
whom abe addressed conscientiously as ‘major hengest
and mr. horsa,’ and with the heir to a scandinavian throne
and the novelist just back from russia, and with abe, who
was desperate and witty, and with collis clay, who joined
them somewhere and stayed along—and felt there was no
comparison. the enthusiasm, the selflessness behind the
whole performance ravished her, the technic of moving
many varied types, each as immobile, as dependent on supplies
of attention as an infantry battalion is dependent on
rations, appeared so effortless that he still had pieces of his
own most personal self for everyone.
—afterward she remembered the times when she had felt
the happiest. the first time was when she and dick danced
together and she felt her beauty sparkling bright against
his tall, strong form as they floated, hovering like people
in an amusing dream—he turned her here and there with
such a delicacy of suggestion that she was like a bright bouquet,
a piece of precious cloth being displayed before fifty
eyes. there was a moment when they were not dancing at
all, simply clinging together. some time in the early morning
they were alone, and her damp powdery young body

came up close to him in a crush of tired cloth, and stayed
there, crushed against a background of other people’s hats
and wraps... .
the time she laughed most was later, when six of them,
the best of them, noblest relics of the evening, stood in the
dusky front lobby of the ritz telling the night concierge
that general pershing was outside and wanted caviare and
champagne. ‘he brooks no delay. every man, every gun is at
his service.’ frantic waiters emerged from nowhere, a table
was set in the lobby, and abe came in representing general
pershing while they stood up and mumbled remembered
fragments of war songs at him. in the waiters’ injured reaction
to this anti-climax they found themselves neglected, so
they built a waiter trap—a huge and fantastic device constructed
of all the furniture in the lobby and functioning
like one of the bizarre machines of a goldberg cartoon. abe
shook his head doubtfully at it.
‘perhaps it would be better to steal a musical saw and—‘
‘that’s enough,’ mary interrupted. ‘when abe begins
bringing up that it’s time to go home.’ anxiously she confided
to rosemary:
‘i’ve got to get abe home. his boat train leaves at eleven.
it’s so important—i feel the whole future depends on his
catching it, but whenever i argue with him he does the exact
opposite.’
‘i’ll try and persuade him,’ offered rosemary.
‘would you?’ mary said doubtfully. ‘maybe you could.’
then dick came up to rosemary:
‘nicole and i are going home and we thought you’d want 
118 tender is the night
to go with us.’
her face was pale with fatigue in the false dawn. two
wan dark spots in her cheek marked where the color was
by day.
‘i can’t,’ she said. ‘i promised mary north to stay along
with them—or abe’ll never go to bed. maybe you could do
something.’
‘don’t you know you can’t do anything about people?’ he
advised her. ‘if abe was my room-mate in college, tight for
the first time, it’d be different. now there’s nothing to do.’
‘well, i’ve got to stay. he says he’ll go to bed if we only
come to the halles with him,’ she said, almost defiantly.
he kissed the inside of her elbow quickly.
‘don’t let rosemary go home alone,’ nicole called to
mary as they left. ‘we feel responsible to her mother.’
—later rosemary and the norths and a manufacturer of
dolls’ voices from newark and ubiquitous collis and a big
splendidly dressed oil indian named george t. horseprotection
were riding along on top of thousands of carrots
in a market wagon. the earth in the carrot beards was fragrant
and sweet in the darkness, and rosemary was so high
up in the load that she could hardly see the others in the
long shadow between infrequent street lamps. their voices
came from far off, as if they were having experiences different
from hers, different and far away, for she was with dick
in her heart, sorry she had come with the norths, wishing
she was at the hotel and him asleep across the hall, or that
he was here beside her with the warm darkness streaming
down.

‘don’t come up,’ she called to collis, ‘the carrots will all
roll.’ she threw one at abe who was sitting beside the driver,
stiffly like an old man... .
later she was homeward bound at last in broad daylight,
with the pigeons already breaking over saint-sulpice. all
of them began to laugh spontaneously because they knew
it was still last night while the people in the streets had the
delusion that it was bright hot morning.
‘at last i’ve been on a wild party,’ thought rosemary, ‘but
it’s no fun when dick isn’t there.’
she felt a little betrayed and sad, but presently a moving
object came into sight. it was a huge horse-chestnut tree
in full bloom bound for the champs élysées, strapped now
into a long truck and simply shaking with laughter—like a
lovely person in an undignified position yet confident none
the less of being lovely. looking at it with fascination rosemary
identified herself with it, and laughed cheerfully with
it, and everything all at once seemed gorgeous.
120 tender is the night
xix
abe left from the gare saint lazare at eleven—he stood
alone under the fouled glass dome, relic of the seventies, era
of the crystal palace; his hands, of that vague gray color that
only twenty-four hours can produce, were in his coat pockets
to conceal the trembling fingers. with his hat removed
it was plain that only the top layer of his hair was brushed
back—the lower levels were pointed resolutely sidewise. he
was scarcely recognizable as the man who had swum upon
gausse’s beach a fortnight ago.
he was early; he looked from left to right with his eyes
only; it would have taken nervous forces out of his control to
use any other part of his body. new-looking baggage went
past him; presently prospective passengers, with dark little
bodies, were calling: ‘jew-uls-hoo-oo!’ in dark piercing
voices.
at the minute when he wondered whether or not he had
time for a drink at the buffet, and began clutching at the
soggy wad of thousand-franc notes in his pocket, one end
of his pendulous glance came to rest upon the apparition of
nicole at the stairhead. he watched her—she was self-revelatory
in her little expressions as people seem to some one
waiting for them, who as yet is himself unobserved. she was
frowning, thinking of her children, less gloating over them
than merely animally counting them—a cat checking her 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 121
cubs with a paw.
when she saw abe, the mood passed out of her face;
the glow of the morning skylight was sad, and abe made
a gloomy figure with dark circles that showed through the
crimson tan under his eyes. they sat down on a bench.
‘i came because you asked me,’ said nicole defensively.
abe seemed to have forgotten why he asked her and nicole
was quite content to look at the travellers passing by.
‘that’s going to be the belle of your boat—that one with
all the men to say good-by—you see why she bought that
dress?’ nicole talked faster and faster. ‘you see why nobody
else would buy it except the belle of the world cruise? see?
no? wake up! that’s a story dress—that extra material tells
a story and somebody on world cruise would be lonesome
enough to want to hear it.’
she bit close her last words; she had talked too much for
her; and abe found it difficult to gather from her serious set
face that she had spoken at all. with an effort he drew himself
up to a posture that looked as if he were standing up
while he was sitting down.
‘the afternoon you took me to that funny ball—you
know, st. genevieve’s—‘ he began.
‘i remember. it was fun, wasn’t it?’
‘no fun for me. i haven’t had fun seeing you this time.
i’m tired of you both, but it doesn’t show because you’re
even more tired of me—you know what i mean. if i had any
enthusiasm, i’d go on to new people.’
there was a rough nap on nicole’s velvet gloves as she
slapped him back:
122 tender is the night
‘seems rather foolish to be unpleasant, abe. anyhow you
don’t mean that. i can’t see why you’ve given up about everything.’
abe considered, trying hard not to cough or blow his
nose.
‘i suppose i got bored; and then it was such a long way to
go back in order to get anywhere.’
often a man can play the helpless child in front of a
woman, but he can almost never bring it off when he feels
most like a helpless child.
‘no excuse for it,’ nicole said crisply.
abe was feeling worse every minute—he could think
of nothing but disagreeable and sheerly nervous remarks.
nicole thought that the correct attitude for her was to sit
staring straight ahead, hands in her lap. for a while there
was no communication between them— each was racing
away from the other, breathing only insofar as there was blue
space ahead, a sky not seen by the other. unlike lovers they
possessed no past; unlike man and wife, they possessed no
future; yet up to this morning nicole had liked abe better
than any one except dick—and he had been heavy, bellyfrightened,
with love for her for years.
‘tired of women’s worlds,’ he spoke up suddenly.
‘then why don’t you make a world of your own?’
‘tired of friends. the thing is to have sycophants.’
nicole tried to force the minute hand around on the station
clock, but, ‘you agree?’ he demanded.
‘i am a woman and my business is to hold things together.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 123
‘my business is to tear them apart.’
‘when you get drunk you don’t tear anything apart
except yourself,’ she said, cold now, and frightened and unconfident.
the station was filling but no one she knew came.
after a moment her eyes fell gratefully on a tall girl with
straw hair like a helmet, who was dropping letters in the
mail slot.
‘a girl i have to speak to, abe. abe, wake up! you fool!’
patiently abe followed her with his eyes. the woman
turned in a startled way to greet nicole, and abe recognized
her as some one he had seen around paris. he took
advantage of nicole’s absence to cough hard and retchingly
into his handkerchief, and to blow his nose loud. the morning
was warmer and his underwear was soaked with sweat.
his fingers trembled so violently that it took four matches
to light a cigarette; it seemed absolutely necessary to make
his way into the buffet for a drink, but immediately nicole
returned.
‘that was a mistake,’ she said with frosty humor. ‘after
begging me to come and see her, she gave me a good snubbing.
she looked at me as if i were rotted.’ excited, she did a
little laugh, as with two fingers high in the scales. ‘let people
come to you.’
abe recovered from a cigarette cough and remarked:
‘trouble is when you’re sober you don’t want to see anybody,
and when you’re tight nobody wants to see you.’
‘who, me?’ nicole laughed again; for some reason the
late encounter had cheered her.
‘no—me.’
124 tender is the night
‘speak for yourself. i like people, a lot of people—i
like—‘
rosemary and mary north came in sight, walking slowly
and searching for abe, and nicole burst forth grossly
with ‘hey! hi! hey!’ and laughed and waved the package of
handkerchiefs she had bought for abe.
they stood in an uncomfortable little group weighted
down by abe’s gigantic presence: he lay athwart them like
the wreck of a galleon, dominating with his presence his
own weakness and self-indulgence, his narrowness and bitterness.
all of them were conscious of the solemn dignity
that flowed from him, of his achievement, fragmentary,
suggestive and surpassed. but they were frightened at his
survivant will, once a will to live, now become a will to die.
dick diver came and brought with him a fine glowing
surface on which the three women sprang like monkeys
with cries of relief, perching on his shoulders, on the beautiful
crown of his hat or the gold head of his cane. now, for a
moment, they could disregard the spectacle of abe’s gigantic
obscenity. dick saw the situation quickly and grasped it
quietly. he pulled them out of themselves into the station,
making plain its wonders. nearby, some americans were
saying good-by in voices that mimicked the cadence of water
running into a large old bathtub. standing in the station,
with paris in back of them, it seemed as if they were vicariously
leaning a little over the ocean, already undergoing a
sea-change, a shifting about of atoms to form the essential
molecule of a new people.
so the well-to-do americans poured through the station 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 125
onto the platforms with frank new faces, intelligent, considerate,
thoughtless, thought-for. an occasional english face
among them seemed sharp and emergent. when there were
enough americans on the platform the first impression of
their immaculacy and their money began to fade into a
vague racial dusk that hindered and blinded both them and
their observers.
nicole seized dick’s arm crying, ‘look!’ dick turned in
time to see what took place in half a minute. at a pullman
entrance two cars off, a vivid scene detached itself from the
tenor of many farewells. the young woman with the helmetlike
hair to whom nicole had spoken made an odd dodging
little run away from the man to whom she was talking and
plunged a frantic hand into her purse; then the sound of
two revolver shots cracked the narrow air of the platform.
simultaneously the engine whistled sharply and the train
began to move, momentarily dwarfing the shots in significance.
abe waved again from his window, oblivious to what
had happened. but before the crowd closed in, the others
had seen the shots take effect, seen the target sit down upon
the platform.
only after a hundred years did the train stop; nicole,
mary, and rosemary waited on the outskirts while dick
fought his way through. it was five minutes before he found
them again—by this time the crowd had split into two sections,
following, respectively, the man on a stretcher and the
girl walking pale and firm between distraught gendarmes.
‘it was maria wallis,’ dick said hurriedly. ‘the man she
shot was an englishman—they had an awful time finding 
126 tender is the night
out who, because she shot him through his identification
card.’ they were walking quickly from the train, swayed
along with the crowd. ‘i found out what poste de police
they’re taking her to so i’ll go there—‘
‘but her sister lives in paris,’ nicole objected. ‘why not
phone her? seems very peculiar nobody thought of that.
she’s married to a frenchman, and he can do more than
we can.’
dick hesitated, shook his head and started off.
‘wait!’ nicole cried after him. ‘that’s foolish—how can
you do any good—with your french?’
‘at least i’ll see they don’t do anything outrageous to
her.’
‘they’re certainly going to hold on to her,’ nicole assured
him briskly. ‘she did shoot the man. the best thing is to
phone right away to laura—she can do more than we can.’
dick was unconvinced—also he was showing off for
rosemary.
‘you wait,’ said nicole firmly, and hurried off to a telephone
booth.
‘when nicole takes things into her hands,’ he said with
affectionate irony, ‘there is nothing more to be done.’
he saw rosemary for the first time that morning. they
exchanged glances, trying to recognize the emotions of the
day before. for a moment each seemed unreal to the other—then
the slow warm hum of love began again.
‘you like to help everybody, don’t you?’ rosemary said.
‘i only pretend to.’
‘mother likes to help everybody—of course she can’t help 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 127
as many people as you do.’ she sighed. ‘sometimes i think
i’m the most selfish person in the world.’
for the first time the mention of her mother annoyed
rather than amused dick. he wanted to sweep away her
mother, remove the whole affair from the nursery footing
upon which rosemary persistently established it. but he realized
that this impulse was a loss of control—what would
become of rosemary’s urge toward him if, for even a moment,
he relaxed. he saw, not without panic, that the affair
was sliding to rest; it could not stand still, it must go on or
go back; for the first time it occurred to him that rosemary
had her hand on the lever more authoritatively than he.
before he had thought out a course of procedure, nicole
returned.
‘i found laura. it was the first news she had and her voice
kept fading away and then getting loud again—as if she was
fainting and then pulling herself together. she said she knew
something was going to happen this morning.’
‘maria ought to be with diaghileff,’ said dick in a gentle
tone, in order to bring them back to quietude. ‘she has a
nice sense of decor—not to say rhythm. will any of us ever
see a train pulling out without hearing a few shots?’
they bumped down the wide steel steps. ‘i’m sorry for
the poor man,’ nicole said. ‘course that’s why she talked so
strange to me— she was getting ready to open fire.’
she laughed, rosemary laughed too, but they were both
horrified, and both of them deeply wanted dick to make a
moral comment on the matter and not leave it to them. this
wish was not entirely conscious, especially on the part of 
128 tender is the night
rosemary, who was accustomed to having shell fragments
of such events shriek past her head. but a totality of shock
had piled up in her too. for the moment, dick was too
shaken by the impetus of his newly recognized emotion to
resolve things into the pattern of the holiday, so the women,
missing something, lapsed into a vague unhappiness.
then, as if nothing had happened, the lives of the divers
and their friends flowed out into the street.
however, everything had happened—abe’s departure
and mary’s impending departure for salzburg this afternoon
had ended the time in paris. or perhaps the shots, the
concussions that had finished god knew what dark matter,
had terminated it. the shots had entered into all their
lives: echoes of violence followed them out onto the pavement
where two porters held a post-mortem beside them as
they waited for a taxi.
‘tu as vu le revolver? il était très petit, vraie perle—un
jouet.’
‘mais, assez puissant!’ said the other porter sagely. ‘tu as
vu sa chemise? assez de sang pour se croire à la guerre.’

in the square, as they came out, a suspended mass of gasoline
exhaust cooked slowly in the july sun. it was a terrible
thing— unlike pure heat it held no promise of rural escape
but suggested only roads choked with the same foul asthma.
during their luncheon, outdoors, across from the luxembourg
gardens, rosemary had cramps and felt fretful and
full of impatient lassitude—it was the foretaste of this that
had inspired her self-accusation of selfishness in the station.
dick had no suspicion of the sharpness of the change;
he was profoundly unhappy and the subsequent increase of
egotism tended momentarily to blind him to what was going
on round about him, and deprive him of the long groundswell
of imagination that he counted on for his judgments.
after mary north left them, accompanied by the italian
singing teacher who had joined them for coffee and was taking
her to her train, rosemary, too, stood up, bound for an
engagement at her studio: ‘meet some officials.’
‘and oh—‘ she proposed ‘—if collis clay, that southern
boy—if he comes while you are still sitting here, just tell
him i couldn’t wait; tell him to call me to-morrow.’
too insouciant, in reaction from the late disturbance,
she had assumed the privileges of a child—the result being
to remind the divers of their exclusive love for their own 
130 tender is the night
children; rosemary was sharply rebuked in a short passage
between the women: ‘you’d better leave the message with
a waiter,’ nicole’s voice was stern and unmodulated, ‘we’re
leaving immediately.’
rosemary got it, took it without resentment.
‘i’ll let it go then. good-by, you darlings.’
dick asked for the check; the divers relaxed, chewing
tentatively on toothpicks.
‘well—‘ they said together.
he saw a flash of unhappiness on her mouth, so brief that
only he would have noticed, and he could pretend not to
have seen. what did nicole think? rosemary was one of a
dozen people he had ‘worked over’ in the past years: these
had included a french circus clown, abe and mary north,
a pair of dancers, a writer, a painter, a comedienne from
the grand guignol, a half-crazy pederast from the russian
ballet, a promising tenor they had staked to a year in milan.
nicole well knew how seriously these people interpreted his
interest and enthusiasm; but she realized also that, except
while their children were being born, dick had not spent
a night apart from her since their marriage. on the other
hand, there was a pleasingness about him that simply had
to be used—those who possessed that pleasingness had to
keep their hands in, and go along attaching people that they
had no use to make of.
now dick hardened himself and let minutes pass without
making any gesture of confidence, any representation of
constantly renewed surprise that they were one together.
collis clay out of the south edged a passage between the 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 131
closely packed tables and greeted the divers cavalierly. such
salutations always astonished dick—acquaintances saying
‘hi!’ to them, or speaking only to one of them. he felt so intensely
about people that in moments of apathy he preferred
to remain concealed; that one could parade a casualness into
his presence was a challenge to the key on which he lived.
collis, unaware that he was without a wedding garment,
heralded his arrival with: ‘i reckon i’m late—the beyed has
flown.’ dick had to wrench something out of himself before
he could forgive him for not having first complimented nicole.
she left almost immediately and he sat with collis, finishing
the last of his wine. he rather liked collis—he was
‘post-war”; less difficult than most of the southerners he
had known at new haven a decade previously. dick listened
with amusement to the conversation that accompanied the
slow, profound stuffing of a pipe. in the early afternoon
children and nurses were trekking into the luxembourg
gardens; it was the first time in months that dick had let
this part of the day out of his hands.
suddenly his blood ran cold as he realized the content of
collis’s confidential monologue.
‘—she’s not so cold as you’d probably think. i admit i
thought she was cold for a long time. but she got into a jam
with a friend of mine going from new york to chicago at
easter—a boy named hillis she thought was pretty nutsey at
new haven—she had a compartment with a cousin of mine
but she and hillis wanted to be alone, so in the afternoon
my cousin came and played cards in our compartment. 
132 tender is the night
well, after about two hours we went back and there was
rosemary and bill hillis standing in the vestibule arguing
with the conductor—rosemary white as a sheet. seems
they locked the door and pulled down the blinds and i guess
there was some heavy stuff going on when the conductor
came for the tickets and knocked on the door. they thought
it was us kidding them and wouldn’t let him in at first, and
when they did, he was plenty sore. he asked hillis if that
was his compartment and whether he and rosemary were
married that they locked the door, and hillis lost his temper
trying to explain there was nothing wrong. he said the conductor
had insulted rosemary and he wanted him to fight,
but that conductor could have made trouble—and believe
me i had an awful time smoothing it over.’
with every detail imagined, with even envy for the
pair’s community of misfortune in the vestibule, dick felt a
change taking place within him. only the image of a third
person, even a vanished one, entering into his relation with
rosemary was needed to throw him off his balance and
send through him waves of pain, misery, desire, desperation.
the vividly pictured hand on rosemary’s cheek, the
quicker breath, the white excitement of the event viewed
from outside, the inviolable secret warmth within.
—do you mind if i pull down the curtain?
—please do. it’s too light in here.
collis clay was now speaking about fraternity politics at
new haven, in the same tone, with the same emphasis. dick
had gathered that he was in love with rosemary in some curious
way dick could not have understood. the affair with 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 133
hillis seemed to have made no emotional impression on
collis save to give him the joyful conviction that rosemary
was ‘human.’
‘bones got a wonderful crowd,’ he said. ‘we all did, as a
matter of fact. new haven’s so big now the sad thing is the
men we have to leave out.’
—do you mind if i pull down the curtain?
—please do. it’s too light in here.
... dick went over paris to his bank—writing a check, he
looked along the row of men at the desks deciding to which
one he would present it for an o.k. as he wrote he engrossed
himself in the material act, examining meticulously the
pen, writing laboriously upon the high glass-topped desk.
once he raised glazed eyes to look toward the mail department,
then glazed his spirit again by concentration upon
the objects he dealt with.
still he failed to decide to whom the check should be
presented, which man in the line would guess least of the
unhappy predicament in which he found himself and, also,
which one would be least likely to talk. there was perrin,
the suave new yorker, who had asked him to luncheons at
the american club, there was casasus, the spaniard, with
whom he usually discussed a mutual friend in spite of the
fact that the friend had passed out of his life a dozen years
before; there was muchhause, who always asked him whether
he wanted to draw upon his wife’s money or his own.
as he entered the amount on the stub, and drew two
lines under it, he decided to go to pierce, who was young
and for whom he would have to put on only a small show. it 
134 tender is the night
was often easier to give a show than to watch one.
he went to the mail desk first—as the woman who served
him pushed up with her bosom a piece of paper that had
nearly escaped the desk, he thought how differently women
use their bodies from men. he took his letters aside to open:
there was a bill for seventeen psychiatric books from a german
concern, a bill from brentano’s, a letter from buffalo
from his father, in a handwriting that year by year became
more indecipherable; there was a card from tommy barban
postmarked fez and bearing a facetious communication;
there were letters from doctors in zurich, both in german;
a disputed bill from a plasterer in cannes; a bill from
a furniture maker; a letter from the publisher of a medical
journal in baltimore, miscellaneous announcements and
an invitation to a showing of pictures by an incipient artist;
also there were three letters for nicole, and a letter for rosemary
sent in his care.
—do you mind if i pull down the curtain?
he went toward pierce but he was engaged with a woman,
and dick saw with his heels that he would have to present
his check to casasus at the next desk, who was free.
‘how are you, diver?’ casasus was genial. he stood up,
his mustache spreading with his smile. ‘we were talking
about featherstone the other day and i thought of you—he’s
out in california now.’
dick widened his eyes and bent forward a little.
‘in cali-for-nia?’
‘that’s what i heard.’
dick held the check poised; to focus the attention of 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 135
casasus upon it he looked toward pierce’s desk, holding the
latter for a moment in a friendly eye-play conditioned by an
old joke of three years before when pierce had been involved
with a lithuanian countess. pierce played up with a grin
until casasus had authorized the check and had no further
recourse to detain dick, whom he liked, than to stand up
holding his pince-nez and repeat, ‘yes, he’s in california.’
meanwhile dick had seen that perrin, at the head of the
line of desks, was in conversation with the heavyweight
champion of the world; from a sidesweep of perrin’s eye
dick saw that he was considering calling him over and introducing
him, but that he finally decided against it.
cutting across the social mood of casasus with the intensity
he had accumulated at the glass desk—which is to
say he looked hard at the check, studying it, and then fixed
his eyes on grave problems beyond the first marble pillar to
the right of the banker’s head and made a business of shifting
the cane, hat, and letters he carried—he said good-by
and went out. he had long ago purchased the doorman; his
taxi sprang to the curb.
‘i want to go to the films par excellence studio—it’s on
a little street in passy. go to the muette. i’ll direct you from
there.’
he was rendered so uncertain by the events of the last
forty-eight hours that he was not even sure of what he wanted
to do; he paid off the taxi at the muette and walked in
the direction of the studio, crossing to the opposite side of
the street before he came to the building. dignified in his
fine clothes, with their fine accessories, he was yet swayed 
136 tender is the night
and driven as an animal. dignity could come only with an
overthrowing of his past, of the effort of the last six years.
he went briskly around the block with the fatuousness of
one of tarkington’s adolescents, hurrying at the blind places
lest he miss rosemary’s coming out of the studio. it was
a melancholy neighborhood. next door to the place he saw
a sign: ‘1000 chemises.’ the shirts filled the window, piled,
cravated, stuffed, or draped with shoddy grace on the showcase
floor: ‘1000 chemises’—count them! on either side he
read: ‘papeterie,’ ‘pâtisserie,’ ‘solde,’ ‘réclame’—and constance
talmadge in ‘déjeuner de soleil,’ and farther away
there were more sombre announcements: ‘vêtements ecclé-
siastiques,’ ‘déclaration de décès’ and ‘pompes funèbres.’
life and death.
he knew that what he was now doing marked a turning
point in his life—it was out of line with everything that had
preceded it—even out of line with what effect he might hope
to produce upon rosemary. rosemary saw him always as
a model of correctness—his presence walking around this
block was an intrusion. but dick’s necessity of behaving as
he did was a projection of some submerged reality: he was
compelled to walk there, or stand there, his shirtsleeve fitting
his wrist and his coat sleeve encasing his shirtsleeve
like a sleeve valve, his collar molded plastically to his neck,
his red hair cut exactly, his hand holding his small briefcase
like a dandy—just as another man once found it necessary
to stand in front of a church in ferrara, in sackcloth and
ashes. dick was paying some tribute to things unforgotten,
unshriven, unexpurgated.

xxi
after three-quarters of an hour of standing around, he
became suddenly involved in a human contact. it was just
the sort of thing that was likely to happen to him when he
was in the mood of not wanting to see any one. so rigidly
did he sometimes guard his exposed self-consciousness that
frequently he defeated his own purposes; as an actor who
underplays a part sets up a craning forward, a stimulated
emotional attention in an audience, and seems to create in
others an ability to bridge the gap he has left open. similarly
we are seldom sorry for those who need and crave our
pity—we reserve this for those who, by other means, make
us exercise the abstract function of pity.
so dick might, himself, have analyzed the incident that
ensued. as he paced the rue des saintes-anges he was spoken
to by a thin-faced american, perhaps thirty, with an air
of being scarred and a slight but sinister smile. as dick gave
him the light he requested, he placed him as one of a type of

loafed about tobacco stores with one elbow on the counter
and watched, through heaven knew what small chink of the
mind, the people who came in and out. intimate to garages,
where he had vague business conducted in undertones,
to barber shops, to the lobbies of theatres—in such places,
at any rate, dick placed him. sometimes the face bobbed 
138 tender is the night
up in one of tad’s more savage cartoons—in boyhood dick
had often thrown an uneasy glance at the dim borderland of
crime on which he stood.
‘how do you like paris, buddy?’
not waiting for an answer the man tried to fit in his
footsteps with dick’s: ‘where you from?’ he asked encouragingly.
‘from buffalo.’
‘i’m from san antone—but i been over here since the
war.’
‘you in the army?’
‘i’ll say i was. eighty-fourth division—ever heard of
that outfit?’
the man walked a little ahead of him and fixed him with
eyes that were practically menacing.
‘staying in paris awhile, buddy? or just passing
through.’
‘passing through.’
‘what hotel you staying at?’
dick had begun laughing to himself—the party had the
intention of rifling his room that night. his thoughts were
read apparently without self-consciousness.
‘with a build like yours you oughtn’t to be afraid of me,
buddy. there’s a lot of bums around just laying for american
tourists, but you needn’t be afraid of me.’
becoming bored, dick stopped walking: ‘i just wonder
why you’ve got so much time to waste.’
‘i’m in business here in paris.’
‘in what line?’

‘selling papers.’
the contrast between the formidable manner and the
mild profession was absurd—but the man amended it with:
‘don’t worry; i made plenty money last year—ten or
twenty francs for a sunny times that cost six.’
he produced a newspaper clipping from a rusty wallet
and passed it over to one who had become a fellow stroller—
the cartoon showed a stream of americans pouring from
the gangplank of a liner freighted with gold.
‘two hundred thousand—spending ten million a summer.’
‘what you doing out here in passy?’
his companion looked around cautiously. ‘movies,’ he
said darkly. ‘they got an american studio over there. and
they need guys can speak english. i’m waiting for a break.’
dick shook him off quickly and firmly.
it had become apparent that rosemary either had escaped
on one of his early circuits of the block or else had
left before he came into the neighborhood; he went into the
bistro on the corner, bought a lead disk and, squeezed in an
alcove between the kitchen and the foul toilet, he called the
roi george. he recognized cheyne-stokes tendencies in his
respiration—but like everything the symptom served only
to turn him in toward his emotion. he gave the number of
the hotel; then stood holding the phone and staring into the
café; after a long while a strange little voice said hello.
‘this is dick—i had to call you.’
a pause from her—then bravely, and in key with his
emotion: ‘i’m glad you did.’
140 tender is the night
‘i came to meet you at your studio—i’m out in passy
across the way from it. i thought maybe we’d ride around
through the bois.’
‘oh, i only stayed there a minute! i’m so sorry.’ a silence.
‘rosemary.’
‘yes, dick.’
‘look, i’m in an extraordinary condition about you.
when a child can disturb a middle-aged gent—things get
difficult.’
‘you’re not middle-aged, dick—you’re the youngest person
in the world.’
‘rosemary?’ silence while he stared at a shelf that held
the humbler poisons of france—bottles of otard, rhum
st. james, marie brizzard, punch orangeade, andré fernet
blanco, cherry rochet, and armagnac.
‘are you alone?’
—do you mind if i pull down the curtain?
‘who do you think i’d be with?’
‘that’s the state i’m in. i’d like to be with you now.’
silence, then a sigh and an answer. ‘i wish you were with
me now.’
there was the hotel room where she lay behind a telephone
number, and little gusts of music wailed around
her—
“and two—for tea.
and me for you,
and you for me

alow-own.’
there was the remembered dust of powder over her tan—
when he kissed her face it was damp around the corners of
her hair; there was the flash of a white face under his own,
the arc of a shoulder.
‘it’s impossible,’ he said to himself. in a minute he was
out in the street marching along toward the muette, or away
from it, his small brief-case still in his hand, his gold-headed
stick held at a sword-like angle.
rosemary returned to her desk and finished a letter to
her mother.
‘—i only saw him for a little while but i thought he was
wonderful looking. i fell in love with him (of course i do
love dick best but you know what i mean). he really is
going to direct the picture and is leaving immediately for
hollywood, and i think we ought to leave, too. collis clay
has been here. i like him all right but have not seen much of
him because of the divers, who really are divine, about the
nicest people i ever knew. i am feeling not very well to-day
and am taking the medicine, though see no need for it. i’m
not even going to try to tell you all that’s happened until
i see you!!! so when you get this letter wire, wire,
wire! are you coming north or shall i come south with
the divers?’
at six dick called nicole.
‘have you any special plans?’ he asked. ‘would you like to
do something quiet—dinner at the hotel and then a play?’
‘would you? i’ll do whatever you want. i phoned rose-
142 tender is the night
mary a while ago and she’s having dinner in her room. i
think this upset all of us, don’t you?’
‘it didn’t upset me,’ he objected. ‘darling, unless you’re
physically tired let’s do something. otherwise we’ll get south
and spend a week wondering why we didn’t see boucher. it’s
better than brooding—‘
this was a blunder and nicole took him up sharply.
‘brooding about what?’
‘about maria wallis.’
she agreed to go to a play. it was a tradition between
them that they should never be too tired for anything, and
they found it made the days better on the whole and put
the evenings more in order. when, inevitably, their spirits
flagged they shifted the blame to the weariness and fatigue
of others. before they went out, as fine-looking a couple as
could be found in paris, they knocked softly at rosemary’s
door. there was no answer; judging that she was asleep they
walked into a warm strident paris night, snatching a vermouth
and bitters in the shadow by fouquet’s bar.

nicole awoke late, murmuring something back into her
dream before she parted her long lashes tangled with sleep.
dick’s bed was empty—only after a minute did she realize
that she had been awakened by a knock at their salon door.
‘entrez!’ she called, but there was no answer, and after a
moment she slipped on a dressing-gown and went to open
it. a sergent-deville confronted her courteously and stepped
inside the door.
‘mr. afghan north—he is here?’
‘what? no—he’s gone to america.’
‘when did he leave, madame?’
‘yesterday morning.’
he shook his head and waved his forefinger at her in a
quicker rhythm.
‘he was in paris last night. he is registered here but his
room is not occupied. they told me i had better ask at this
room.’
‘sounds very peculiar to me—we saw him off yesterday
morning on the boat train.’
‘be that as it may, he has been seen here this morning.
even his carte d’identité has been seen. and there you are.’
‘we know nothing about it,’ she proclaimed in amazement.
he considered. he was an ill-smelling, handsome man.
144 tender is the night
‘you were not with him at all last night?’
‘but no.’
‘we have arrested a negro. we are convinced we have at
last arrested the correct negro.’
‘i assure you that i haven’t an idea what you’re talking
about. if it’s the mr. abraham north, the one we know, well,
if he was in paris last night we weren’t aware of it.’
the man nodded, sucked his upper lip, convinced but
disappointed.
‘what happened?’ nicole demanded.
he showed his palms, puffing out his closed mouth. he
had begun to find her attractive and his eyes flickered at
her.
‘what do you wish, madame? a summer affair. mr. afghan
north was robbed and he made a complaint. we have
arrested the miscreant. mr. afghan should come to identify
him and make the proper charges.’
nicole pulled her dressing-gown closer around her
and dismissed him briskly. mystified she took a bath and
dressed. by this time it was after ten and she called rosemary
but got no answer—then she phoned the hotel office
and found that abe had indeed registered, at six-thirty this
morning. his room, however, was still unoccupied. hoping
for a word from dick she waited in the parlor of the suite;
just as she had given up and decided to go out, the office
called and announced:
‘meestaire crawshow, un nègre.’
‘on what business?’ she demanded.
‘he says he knows you and the doctaire. he says there is 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 145
a meestaire freeman into prison that is a friend of all the
world. he says there is injustice and he wishes to see meestaire
north before he himself is arrested.’
‘we know nothing about it.’ nicole disclaimed the whole
business with a vehement clap of the receiver. abe’s bizarre
reappearance made it plain to her how fatigued she
was with his dissipation. dismissing him from her mind
she went out, ran into rosemary at the dressmaker’s, and
shopped with her for artificial flowers and allcolored strings
of colored beads on the rue de rivoli. she helped rosemary
choose a diamond for her mother, and some scarfs and
novel cigarette cases to take home to business associates in
california. for her son she bought greek and roman soldiers,
a whole army of them, costing over a thousand francs.
once again they spent their money in different ways and
again rosemary admired nicole’s method of spending.
nicole was sure that the money she spent was hers— rosemary
still thought her money was miraculously lent to her
and she must consequently be very careful of it.
it was fun spending money in the sunlight of the foreign
city with healthy bodies under them that sent streams
of color up to their faces; with arms and hands, legs and
ankles that they stretched out confidently, reaching or stepping
with the confidence of women lovely to men.
when they got back to the hotel and found dick, all
bright and new in the morning, both of them had a moment
of complete childish joy.
he had just received a garbled telephone call from abe
who, so it appeared, had spent the forenoon in hiding.
146 tender is the night
‘it was one of the most extraordinary telephone conversations
i’ve ever held.’
dick had talked not only to abe but to a dozen others.
on the phone these supernumeraries had been typically introduced
as: ‘— man wants to talk to you is in the teput
dome, well he says he was in it—what is it?
‘hey, somebody, shut-up—anyhow, he was in some
shandel-scandal and he kaa pos-sibly go home. my own
per-sonal is that—my personal is he’s had a—‘ gulps
sounded and thereafter what the party had, rested with the
unknown.
the phone yielded up a supplementary offer:
‘i thought it would appeal to you anyhow as a psychologist.’
the vague personality who corresponded to this
statement was eventually hung on to the phone; in the sequence
he failed to appeal to dick, as a psychologist, or
indeed as anything else. abe’s conversation flowed on as
follows:
‘hello.’
‘well?’
‘well, hello.’
‘who are you?’
‘well.’ there were interpolated snorts of laughter.
‘well, i’ll put somebody else on the line.’
sometimes dick could hear abe’s voice, accompanied
by scufflings, droppings of the receiver, far-away fragments
such as, ‘no, i don’t, mr. north... .’ then a pert decided voice
had said: ‘if you are a friend of mr. north you will come
down and take him away.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 147
abe cut in, solemn and ponderous, beating it all down
with an overtone of earth-bound determination.
‘dick, i’ve launched a race riot in montmartre. i’m going
over and get freeman out of jail. if a negro from copenhagen
that makes shoe polish—hello, can you hear me—well,
look, if anybody comes there—‘ once again the receiver was
a chorus of innumerable melodies.
‘why you back in paris?’ dick demanded.
‘i got as far as evreux, and i decided to take a plane back
so i could compare it with st. sulpice. i mean i don’t intend
to bring st. sulpice back to paris. i don’t even mean
baroque! i meant st. germain. for god’s sake, wait a minute
and i’ll put the chasseur on the wire.’
‘for god’s sake, don’t.’
‘listen—did mary get off all right?’
‘yes.’
‘dick, i want you to talk with a man i met here this morning,
the son of a naval officer that’s been to every doctor in
europe. let me tell you about him—‘
dick had rung off at this point—perhaps that was a piece
of ingratitude for he needed grist for the grinding activity
of his mind.
‘abe used to be so nice,’ nicole told rosemary. ‘so nice.
long ago—when dick and i were first married. if you had
known him then. he’d come to stay with us for weeks and
weeks and we scarcely knew he was in the house. sometimes
he’d play—sometimes he’d be in the library with a
muted piano, making love to it by the hour—dick, do you
remember that maid? she thought he was a ghost and some-
148 tender is the night
times abe used to meet her in the hall and moo at her, and it
cost us a whole tea service once—but we didn’t care.’
so much fun—so long ago. rosemary envied them their
fun, imagining a life of leisure unlike her own. she knew little
of leisure but she had the respect for it of those who have
never had it. she thought of it as a resting, without realizing
that the divers were as far from relaxing as she was herself.
‘what did this to him?’ she asked. ‘why does he have to
drink?’
nicole shook her head right and left, disclaiming responsibility
for the matter: ‘so many smart men go to pieces
nowadays.’
‘and when haven’t they?’ dick asked. ‘smart men play
close to the line because they have to—some of them can’t
stand it, so they quit.’
‘it must lie deeper than that.’ nicole clung to her conversation;
also she was irritated that dick should contradict
her before rosemary. ‘artists like—well, like fernand don’t
seem to have to wallow in alcohol. why is it just americans
who dissipate?’
there were so many answers to this question that dick
decided to leave it in the air, to buzz victoriously in nicole’s
ears. he had become intensely critical of her. though he
thought she was the most attractive human creature he had
ever seen, though he got from her everything he needed, he
scented battle from afar, and subconsciously he had been
hardening and arming himself, hour by hour. he was not
given to self-indulgence and he felt comparatively graceless
at this moment of indulging himself, blinding his eyes with 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 149
the hope that nicole guessed at only an emotional excitement
about rosemary. he was not sure—last night at the
theatre she had referred pointedly to rosemary as a child.
the trio lunched downstairs in an atmosphere of carpets
and padded waiters, who did not march at the stomping
quick-step of those men who brought good food to the tables
whereon they had recently dined. here there were families
of americans staring around at families of americans, and
trying to make conversation with one another.
there was a party at the next table that they could not
account for. it consisted of an expansive, somewhat secretarial,
wouldyou-mind-repeating young man, and a score of
women. the women were neither young nor old nor of any
particular social class; yet the party gave the impression of a
unit, held more closely together for example than a group of
wives stalling through a professional congress of their husbands.
certainly it was more of a unit than any conceivable
tourist party.
an instinct made dick suck back the grave derision that
formed on his tongue; he asked the waiter to find out who
they were.
‘those are the gold-star muzzers,’ explained the waiter.
aloud and in low voices they exclaimed. rosemary’s eyes
filled with tears.
‘probably the young ones are the wives,’ said nicole.
over his wine dick looked at them again; in their happy
faces, the dignity that surrounded and pervaded the party,
he perceived all the maturity of an older america. for a
while the sobered women who had come to mourn for their 
150 tender is the night
dead, for something they could not repair, made the room
beautiful. momentarily, he sat again on his father’s knee,
riding with moseby while the old loyalties and devotions
fought on around him. almost with an effort he turned
back to his two women at the table and faced the whole new
world in which he believed.
—do you mind if i pull down the curtain?

abe north was still in the ritz bar, where he had been
since nine in the morning. when he arrived seeking sanctuary
the windows were open and great beams were busy
at pulling up the dust from smoky carpets and cushions.
chasseurs tore through the corridors, liberated and disembodied,
moving for the moment in pure space. the sit-down
bar for women, across from the bar proper, seemed very
small—it was hard to imagine what throngs it could accommodate
in the afternoon.
the famous paul, the concessionaire, had not arrived,
but claude, who was checking stock, broke off his work
with no improper surprise to make abe a pick-me-up. abe
sat on a bench against a wall. after two drinks he began to
feel better—so much better that he mounted to the barber’s
shop and was shaved. when he returned to the bar paul had
arrived—in his custom-built motor, from which he had disembarked
correctly at the boulevard des capucines. paul
liked abe and came over to talk.
‘i was supposed to ship home this morning,’ abe said. ‘i
mean yesterday morning, or whatever this is.’
‘why din you?’ asked paul.
abe considered, and happened finally to a reason: ‘i was
reading a serial in liberty and the next installment was due
here in paris— so if i’d sailed i’d have missed it—then i 
152 tender is the night
never would have read it.’
‘it must be a very good story.’
‘it’s a terr-r-rible story.’
paul arose chuckling and paused, leaning on the back of
a chair:
‘if you really want to get off, mr. north, there are friends
of yours going to-morrow on the france—mister what is
this name—and slim pearson. mister—i’ll think of it—tall
with a new beard.’
‘yardly,’ abe supplied.
‘mr. yardly. they’re both going on the france.’
he was on his way to his duties but abe tried to detain
him: ‘if i didn’t have to go by way of cherbourg. the baggage
went that way.’
‘get your baggage in new york,’ said paul, receding.
the logic of the suggestion fitted gradually into abe’s
pitch—he grew rather enthusiastic about being cared for, or
rather of prolonging his state of irresponsibility.
other clients had meanwhile drifted in to the bar: first
came a huge dane whom abe had somewhere encountered.
the dane took a seat across the room, and abe guessed he
would be there all the day, drinking, lunching, talking or
reading newspapers. he felt a desire to out-stay him. at
eleven the college boys began to step in, stepping gingerly
lest they tear one another bag from bag. it was about then
he had the chasseur telephone to the divers; by the time
he was in touch with them he was in touch also with other
friends—and his hunch was to put them all on different
phones at once—the result was somewhat general. from 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 153
time to time his mind reverted to the fact that he ought to
go over and get freeman out of jail, but he shook off all facts
as parts of the nightmare.
by one o’clock the bar was jammed; amidst the consequent
mixture of voices the staff of waiters functioned,
pinning down their clients to the facts of drink and money.
‘that makes two stingers ... and one more ... two martinis
and one ... nothing for you, mr. quarterly ... that makes
three rounds. that makes seventy-five francs, mr. quarterly.
mr. schaeffer said he had this—you had the last ... i can
only do what you say ... thanks vera-much.’
in the confusion abe had lost his seat; now he stood gently
swaying and talking to some of the people with whom he
had involved himself. a terrier ran a leash around his legs
but abe managed to extricate himself without upsetting
and became the recipient of profuse apologies. presently he
was invited to lunch, but declined. it was almost briglith, he
explained, and there was something he had to do at briglith.
a little later, with the exquisite manners of the alcoholic
that are like the manners of a prisoner or a family servant,
he said good-by to an acquaintance, and turning around
discovered that the bar’s great moment was over as precipitately
as it had begun.
across from him the dane and his companions had ordered
luncheon. abe did likewise but scarcely touched it.
afterwards, he just sat, happy to live in the past. the drink
made past happy things contemporary with the present, as
if they were still going on, contemporary even with the future
as if they were about to happen again.
154 tender is the night
at four the chasseur approached him:
‘you wish to see a colored fellow of the name jules peterson?’
‘god! how did he find me?’
‘i didn’t tell him you were present.’
‘who did?’ abe fell over his glasses but recovered himself.
‘says he’s already been around to all the american bars
and hotels.’
‘tell him i’m not here—‘ as the chasseur turned away
abe asked: ‘can he come in here?’
‘i’ll find out.’
receiving the question paul glanced over his shoulder;
he shook his head, then seeing abe he came over.
‘i’m sorry; i can’t allow it.’
abe got himself up with an effort and went out to the
rue cambon.

with his miniature leather brief-case in his hand richard
diver walked from the seventh arrondisement—where
he left a note for maria wallis signed ‘dicole,’ the word with
which he and nicole had signed communications in the
first days of love—to his shirtmakers where the clerks made
a fuss over him out of proportion to the money he spent.
ashamed at promising so much to these poor englishmen,
with his fine manners, his air of having the key to security,
ashamed of making a tailor shift an inch of silk on his
arm. afterward he went to the bar of the crillon and drank
a small coffee and two fingers of gin.
as he entered the hotel the halls had seemed unnaturally
bright; when he left he realized that it was because it had already
turned dark outside. it was a windy four-o’clock night
with the leaves on the champs élysées singing and failing,
thin and wild. dick turned down the rue de rivoli, walking
two squares under the arcades to his bank where there was
mail. then he took a taxi and started up the champs élysées
through the first patter of rain, sitting alone with his love.
back at two o’clock in the roi george corridor the beauty
of nicole had been to the beauty of rosemary as the beauty
of leonardo’s girl was to that of the girl of an illustrator.
dick moved on through the rain, demoniac and frightened,
the passions of many men inside him and nothing simple 
156 tender is the night
that he could see.
rosemary opened her door full of emotions no one else
knew of. she was now what is sometimes called a ‘little wild
thing’—by twentyfour full hours she was not yet unified and
she was absorbed in playing around with chaos; as if her
destiny were a picture puzzle— counting benefits, counting
hopes, telling off dick, nicole, her mother, the director she
met yesterday, like stops on a string of beads.
when dick knocked she had just dressed and been
watching the rain, thinking of some poem, and of full gutters
in beverly hills. when she opened the door she saw him
as something fixed and godlike as he had always been, as
older people are to younger, rigid and unmalleable. dick
saw her with an inevitable sense of disappointment. it took
him a moment to respond to the unguarded sweetness of her
smile, her body calculated to a millimeter to suggest a bud
yet guarantee a flower. he was conscious of the print of her
wet foot on a rug through the bathroom door.
‘miss television,’ he said with a lightness he did not feel.
he put his gloves, his brief-case on the dressing-table, his
stick against the wall. his chin dominated the lines of pain
around his mouth, forcing them up into his forehead and the
corner of his eyes, like fear that cannot be shown in public.
‘come and sit on my lap close to me,’ he said softly, ‘and
let me see about your lovely mouth.’
she came over and sat there and while the dripping slowed
down outside—drip—dri-i-ip, she laid her lips to the beautiful
cold image she had created.
presently she kissed him several times in the mouth, 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 157
her face getting big as it came up to him; he had never
seen anything so dazzling as the quality of her skin, and
since sometimes beauty gives back the images of one’s best
thoughts he thought of his responsibility about nicole, and
of the responsibility of her being two doors down across the
corridor.
‘the rain’s over,’ he said. ‘do you see the sun on the
slate?’
rosemary stood up and leaned down and said her most
sincere thing to him:
‘oh, we’re such actors—you and i.’
she went to her dresser and the moment that she laid her
comb flat against her hair there was a slow persistent knocking
at the door.
they were shocked motionless; the knock was repeated
insistently, and in the sudden realization that the door was
not locked rosemary finished her hair with one stroke, nodded
at dick who had quickly jerked the wrinkles out of the
bed where they had been sitting, and started for the door.
dick said in quite a natural voice, not too loud:
‘—so if you don’t feel up to going out, i’ll tell nicole and
we’ll have a very quiet last evening.’
the precautions were needless for the situation of the
parties outside the door was so harassed as to preclude any
but the most fleeting judgments on matters not pertinent to
themselves. standing there was abe, aged by several months
in the last twentyfour hours, and a very frightened, concerned
colored man whom abe introduced as mr. peterson
of stockholm.
158 tender is the night
‘he’s in a terrible situation and it’s my fault,’ said abe. ‘we
need some good advice.’
‘come in our rooms,’ said dick.
abe insisted that rosemary come too and they crossed
the hall to the divers’ suite. jules peterson, a small, respectable
negro, on the suave model that heels the republican
party in the border states, followed.
it appeared that the latter had been a legal witness to the
early morning dispute in montparnasse; he had accompanied
abe to the police station and supported his assertion
that a thousand franc note had been seized out of his hand
by a negro, whose identification was one of the points of the
case. abe and jules peterson, accompanied by an agent of
police, returned to the bistro and too hastily identified as the
criminal a negro, who, so it was established after an hour,
had only entered the place after abe left. the police had further
complicated the situation by arresting the prominent
negro restaurateur, freeman, who had only drifted through
the alcoholic fog at a very early stage and then vanished.
the true culprit, whose case, as reported by his friends, was
that he had merely commandeered a fifty-franc note to pay
for drinks that abe had ordered, had only recently and in a
somewhat sinister rôle, reappeared upon the scene.
in brief, abe had succeeded in the space of an hour in
entangling himself with the personal lives, consciences, and
emotions of one afro-european and three afro-americans
inhabiting the french latin quarter. the disentanglement
was not even faintly in sight and the day had passed in an
atmosphere of unfamiliar negro faces bobbing up in unex-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 159
pected places and around unexpected corners, and insistent
negro voices on the phone.
in person, abe had succeeded in evading all of them, save
jules peterson. peterson was rather in the position of the
friendly indian who had helped a white. the negroes who
suffered from the betrayal were not so much after abe as
after peterson, and peterson was very much after what protection
he might get from abe.
up in stockholm peterson had failed as a small manufacturer
of shoe polish and now possessed only his formula
and sufficient trade tools to fill a small box; however, his new
protector had promised in the early hours to set him up in
business in versailles. abe’s former chauffeur was a shoemaker
there and abe had handed peterson two hundred
francs on account.
rosemary listened with distaste to this rigmarole; to appreciate
its grotesquerie required a more robust sense of
humor than hers. the little man with his portable manufactory,
his insincere eyes that, from time to time, rolled white
semicircles of panic into view; the figure of abe, his face as
blurred as the gaunt fine lines of it would permit—all this
was as remote from her as sickness.
‘i ask only a chance in life,’ said peterson with the sort of
precise yet distorted intonation peculiar to colonial countries.
‘my methods are simple, my formula is so good that i
was drove away from stockholm, ruined, because i did not
care to dispose of it.’
dick regarded him politely—interest formed, dissolved,
he turned to abe:
160 tender is the night
‘you go to some hotel and go to bed. after you’re all
straight mr. peterson will come and see you.’
‘but don’t you appreciate the mess that peterson’s in?’ abe
protested.
‘i shall wait in the hall,’ said mr. peterson with delicacy.
‘it is perhaps hard to discuss my problems in front of me.’
he withdrew after a short travesty of a french bow; abe
pulled himself to his feet with the deliberation of a locomotive.
‘i don’t seem highly popular to-day.’
‘popular but not probable,’ dick advised him. ‘my advice
is to leave this hotel—by way of the bar, if you want. go to
the chambord, or if you’ll need a lot of service, go over to
the majestic.’
‘could i annoy you for a drink?’
‘there’s not a thing up here,’ dick lied.
resignedly abe shook hands with rosemary; he composed
his face slowly, holding her hand a long time and
forming sentences that did not emerge.
‘you are the most—one of the most—‘
she was sorry, and rather revolted at his dirty hands, but
she laughed in a well-bred way, as though it were nothing
unusual to her to watch a man walking in a slow dream. often
people display a curious respect for a man drunk, rather
like the respect of simple races for the insane. respect rather
than fear. there is something awe-inspiring in one who
has lost all inhibitions, who will do anything. of course we
make him pay afterward for his moment of superiority, his
moment of impressiveness. abe turned to dick with a last 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 161
appeal.
‘if i go to a hotel and get all steamed and curry-combed,
and sleep awhile, and fight off these senegalese—could i
come and spend the evening by the fireside?’
dick nodded at him, less in agreement than in mockery
and said: ‘you have a high opinion of your current capacities.’
‘i bet if nicole was here she’d let me come back.’
‘all right.’ dick went to a trunk tray and brought a box
to the central table; inside were innumerable cardboard letters.
‘you can come if you want to play anagrams.’
abe eyed the contents of the box with physical revulsion,
as though he had been asked to eat them like oats.
‘what are anagrams? haven’t i had enough strange—‘
‘it’s a quiet game. you spell words with them—any word
except alcohol.’
‘i bet you can spell alcohol,’ abe plunged his hand among
the counters. ‘can i come back if i can spell alcohol?’
‘you can come back if you want to play anagrams.’
abe shook his head resignedly.
‘if you’re in that frame of mind there’s no use—i’d just
be in the way.’ he waved his finger reproachfully at dick.
‘but remember what george the third said, that if grant was
drunk he wished he would bite the other generals.’
with a last desperate glance at rosemary from the golden
corners of his eyes, he went out. to his relief peterson was
no longer in the corridor. feeling lost and homeless he went
back to ask paul the name of that boat.
162 tender is the night

when he had tottered out, dick and rosemary embraced
fleetingly. there was a dust of paris over both of them
through which they scented each other: the rubber guard
on dick’s fountain pen, the faintest odor of warmth from
rosemary’s neck and shoulders. for another half-minute
dick clung to the situation; rosemary was first to return
to reality.
‘i must go, youngster,’ she said.
they blinked at each other across a widening space, and
rosemary made an exit that she had learned young, and on
which no director had ever tried to improve.
she opened the door of her room and went directly to
her desk where she had suddenly remembered leaving her
wristwatch. it was there; slipping it on she glanced down at
the daily letter to her mother, finishing the last sentence in
her mind. then, rather gradually, she realized without turning
about that she was not alone in the room.
in an inhabited room there are refracting objects only
half noticed: varnished wood, more or less polished brass,
silver and ivory, and beyond these a thousand conveyers of
light and shadow so mild that one scarcely thinks of them
as that, the tops of pictureframes, the edges of pencils or
ash-trays, of crystal or china ornaments; the totality of
this refraction—appealing to equally subtle reflexes of the 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 163
vision as well as to those associational fragments in the subconscious
that we seem to hang on to, as a glass-fitter keeps
the irregularly shaped pieces that may do some time—this
fact might account for what rosemary afterward mystically
described as ‘realizing’ that there was some one in the room,
before she could determine it. but when she did realize it
she turned swift in a sort of ballet step and saw that a dead
negro was stretched upon her bed.
as she cried ‘aaouu!’ and her still unfastened wristwatch
banged against the desk she had the preposterous idea that
it was abe north. then she dashed for the door and across
the hall.
dick was straightening up; he had examined the gloves
worn that day and thrown them into a pile of soiled gloves
in a corner of a trunk. he had hung up coat and vest and
spread his shirt on another hanger—a trick of his own.
‘you’ll wear a shirt that’s a little dirty where you won’t wear
a mussed shirt.’ nicole had come in and was dumping one
of abe’s extraordinary ash-trays into the waste-basket when
rosemary tore into the room.
‘dick! dick! come and see!’
dick jogged across the hall into her room. he knelt to
peterson’s heart, and felt the pulse—the body was warm, the
face, harassed and indirect in life, was gross and bitter in
death; the box of materials was held under one arm but the
shoe that dangled over the bedside was bare of polish and
its sole was worn through. by french law dick had no right
to touch the body but he moved the arm a little to see something—there
was a stain on the green coverlet, there would 
164 tender is the night
be faint blood on the blanket beneath.
dick closed the door and stood thinking; he heard cautious
steps in the corridor and then nicole calling him by
name. opening the door he whispered: ‘bring the couverture
and top blanket from one of our beds—don’t let any
one see you.’ then, noticing the strained look on her face, he
added quickly, ‘look here, you mustn’t get upset over this—
it’s only some nigger scrap.’
‘i want it to be over.’
the body, as dick lifted it, was light and ill-nourished.
he held it so that further hemorrhages from the wound
would flow into the man’s clothes. laying it beside the bed
he stripped off the coverlet and top blanket and then opening
the door an inch, listened—there was a clank of dishes
down the hall followed by a loud patronizing ‘mer-ci, madame,’
but the waiter went in the other direction, toward
the service stairway. quickly dick and nicole exchanged
bundles across the corridor; after spreading this covering
on rosemary’s bed, dick stood sweating in the warm twilight,
considering. certain points had become apparent to
him in the moment following his examination of the body;
first, that abe’s first hostile indian had tracked the friendly
indian and discovered him in the corridor, and when the
latter had taken desperate refuge in rosemary’s room, had
hunted down and slain him; second, that if the situation
were allowed to develop naturally, no power on earth could
keep the smear off rosemary—the paint was scarcely dry
on the arbuckle case. her contract was contingent upon an
obligation to continue rigidly and unexceptionally as ‘dad-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 165
dy’s girl.’
automatically dick made the old motion of turning up
his sleeves though he wore a sleeveless undershirt, and bent
over the body. getting a purchase on the shoulders of the
coat he kicked open the door with his heel, and dragged the
body quickly into a plausible position in the corridor. he
came back into rosemary’s room and smoothed back the
grain of the plush floor rug. then he went to the phone in
his suite and called the manager-owner of the hotel.
‘mcbeth?—it’s doctor diver speaking—something very
important. are we on a more or less private line?’
it was good that he had made the extra effort which had
firmly entrenched him with mr. mcbeth. here was one use
for all the pleasingness that dick had expended over a large
area he would never retrace... .
‘going out of the suite we came on a dead negro ... in the
hall ... no, no, he’s a civilian. wait a minute now—i knew
you didn’t want any guests to blunder on the body so i’m
phoning you. of course i must ask you to keep my name
out of it. i don’t want any french red tape just because i discovered
the man.’
what exquisite consideration for the hotel! only because
mr. mcbeth, with his own eyes, had seen these traits
in doctor diver two nights before, could he credit the story
without question.
in a minute mr. mcbeth arrived and in another minute
he was joined by a gendarme. in the interval he found
time to whisper to dick, ‘you can be sure the name of any
guest will be protected. i’m only too grateful to you for your 
166 tender is the night
pains.’
mr. mcbeth took an immediate step that may only be
imagined, but that influenced the gendarme so as to make
him pull his mustaches in a frenzy of uneasiness and greed.
he made perfunctory notes and sent a telephone call to his
post. meanwhile with a celerity that jules peterson, as a
business man, would have quite understood, the remains
were carried into another apartment of one of the most
fashionable hotels in the world.
dick went back to his salon.
‘what hap-pened?’ cried rosemary. ‘do all the americans
in paris just shoot at each other all the time?’
‘this seems to be the open season,’ he answered. ‘where’s
nicole?’
‘i think she’s in the bathroom.’
she adored him for saving her—disasters that could have
attended upon the event had passed in prophecy through
her mind; and she had listened in wild worship to his strong,
sure, polite voice making it all right. but before she reached
him in a sway of soul and body his attention focussed on
something else: he went into the bedroom and toward the
bathroom. and now rosemary, too, could hear, louder and
louder, a verbal inhumanity that penetrated the keyholes
and the cracks in the doors, swept into the suite and in the
shape of horror took form again.
with the idea that nicole had fallen in the bathroom and
hurt herself, rosemary followed dick. that was not the condition
of affairs at which she stared before dick shouldered
her back and brusquely blocked her view.

nicole knelt beside the tub swaying sidewise and sidewise.
‘it’s you!’ she cried, ‘—it’s you come to intrude on the
only privacy i have in the world—with your spread with red
blood on it. i’ll wear it for you—i’m not ashamed, though it
was such a pity. on all fools day we had a party on the zurichsee,
and all the fools were there, and i wanted to come
dressed in a spread but they wouldn’t let me—‘
‘control yourself!’
‘—so i sat in the bathroom and they brought me a domino
and said wear that. i did. what else could i do?’
‘control yourself, nicole!’
‘i never expected you to love me—it was too late—only
don’t come in the bathroom, the only place i can go for privacy,
dragging spreads with red blood on them and asking
me to fix them.’
‘control yourself. get up—‘
rosemary, back in the salon, heard the bathroom door
bang, and stood trembling: now she knew what violet
mckisco had seen in the bathroom at villa diana. she answered
the ringing phone and almost cried with relief when
she found it was collis clay, who had traced her to the divers’
apartment. she asked him to come up while she got her
hat, because she was afraid to go into her room alone.

i
in the spring of 1917, when doctor richard diver first arrived
in zurich, he was twenty-six years old, a fine age for a
man, indeed the very acme of bachelorhood. even in wartime
days, it was a fine age for dick, who was already too
valuable, too much of a capital investment to be shot off in a
gun. years later it seemed to him that even in this sanctuary
he did not escape lightly, but about that he never fully made
up his mind—in 1917 he laughed at the idea, saying apologetically
that the war didn’t touch him at all. instructions
from his local board were that he was to complete his studies
in zurich and take a degree as he had planned.
switzerland was an island, washed on one side by the
waves of thunder around gorizia and on another by the
cataracts along the somme and the aisne. for once there
seemed more intriguing strangers than sick ones in the cantons,
but that had to be guessed at—the men who whispered
in the little cafés of berne and geneva were as likely to be
diamond salesmen or commercial travellers. however, no
one had missed the long trains of blinded or one-legged
men, or dying trunks, that crossed each other between the
bright lakes of constance and neuchâtel. in the beer-halls
and shopwindows were bright posters presenting the swiss
defending their frontiers in 1914—with inspiring ferocity
young men and old men glared down from the mountains 
170 tender is the night
at phantom french and germans; the purpose was to assure
the swiss heart that it had shared the contagious glory of
those days. as the massacre continued the posters withered
away, and no country was more surprised than its sister republic
when the united states bungled its way into the war.
doctor diver had seen around the edges of the war by
that time: he was an oxford rhodes scholar from connecticut
in 1914. he returned home for a final year at johns
hopkins, and took his degree. in 1916 he managed to get to
vienna under the impression that, if he did not make haste,
the great freud would eventually succumb to an aeroplane
bomb. even then vienna was old with death but dick managed
to get enough coal and oil to sit in his room in the
damenstiff strasse and write the pamphlets that he later destroyed,
but that, rewritten, were the backbone of the book
he published in zurich in 1920.
most of us have a favorite, a heroic period, in our lives
and that was dick diver’s. for one thing he had no idea that
he was charming, that the affection he gave and inspired was
anything unusual among healthy people. in his last year at
new haven some one referred to him as ‘lucky dick’—the
name lingered in his head.
‘lucky dick, you big stiff,’ he would whisper to himself,
walking around the last sticks of flame in his room. ‘you
hit it, my boy. nobody knew it was there before you came
along.’
at the beginning of 1917, when it was becoming difficult
to find coal, dick burned for fuel almost a hundred textbooks
that he had accumulated; but only, as he laid each one 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 171
on the fire, with an assurance chuckling inside him that he
was himself a digest of what was within the book, that he
could brief it five years from now, if it deserved to be briefed.
this went on at any odd hour, if necessary, with a floor rug
over his shoulders, with the fine quiet of the scholar which
is nearest of all things to heavenly peace— but which, as will
presently be told, had to end.
for its temporary continuance he thanked his body that
had done the flying rings at new haven, and now swam in
the winter danube. with elkins, second secretary at the
embassy, he shared an apartment, and there were two nice
girl visitors—which was that and not too much of it, nor
too much of the embassy either. his contact with ed elkins
aroused in him a first faint doubt as to the quality of
his mental processes; he could not feel that they were profoundly
different from the thinking of elkins—elkins, who
would name you all the quarterbacks in new haven for
thirty years.
‘—and lucky dick can’t be one of these clever men; he
must be less intact, even faintly destroyed. if life won’t do
it for him it’s not a substitute to get a disease, or a broken
heart, or an inferiority complex, though it’d be nice to build
out some broken side till it was better than the original
structure.’
he mocked at his reasoning, calling it specious and
‘american’—his criteria of uncerebral phrase-making was
that it was american. he knew, though, that the price of his
intactness was incompleteness.
‘the best i can wish you, my child,’ so said the fairy 
172 tender is the night
blackstick in thackeray’s the rose and the ring, ‘is a little
misfortune.’
in some moods he griped at his own reasoning: could i
help it that pete livingstone sat in the locker-room tap day
when everybody looked all over hell for him? and i got an
election when otherwise i wouldn’t have got elihu, knowing
so few men. he was good and right and i ought to have sat
in the locker-room instead. maybe i would, if i’d thought i
had a chance at an election. but mercer kept coming to my
room all those weeks. i guess i knew i had a chance all right,
all right. but it would have served me right if i’d swallowed
my pin in the shower and set up a conflict.
after the lectures at the university he used to argue this
point with a young rumanian intellectual who reassured
him: ‘there’s no evidence that goethe ever had a ‘conflict’
in the modern sense, or a man like jung, for instance. you’re
not a romantic philosopher— you’re a scientist. memory,
force, character—especially good sense. that’s going to be
your trouble—judgment about yourself— once i knew a
man who worked two years on the brain of an armadillo,
with the idea that he would sooner or later know more about
the brain of an armadillo than any one. i kept arguing with
him that he was not really pushing out the extension of the
human range—it was too arbitrary. and sure enough, when
he sent his work to the medical journal they refused it—
they had just accepted a thesis by another man on the same
subject.’
dick got up to zurich on less achilles’ heels than would
be required to equip a centipede, but with plenty—the il-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 173
lusions of eternal strength and health, and of the essential
goodness of people; illusions of a nation, the lies of generations
of frontier mothers who had to croon falsely, that
there were no wolves outside the cabin door. after he took
his degree, he received his orders to join a neurological unit
forming in bar-sur-aube.
in france, to his disgust, the work was executive rather
than practical. in compensation he found time to complete
the short textbook and assemble the material for his next
venture. he returned to zurich in the spring of 1919 discharged.
the foregoing has the ring of a biography, without the
satisfaction of knowing that the hero, like grant, lolling in
his general store in galena, is ready to be called to an intricate
destiny. moreover it is confusing to come across a
youthful photograph of some one known in a rounded maturity
and gaze with a shock upon a fiery, wiry, eagle-eyed
stranger. best to be reassuring—dick diver’s moment now
began.
174 tender is the night
ii
it was a damp april day, with long diagonal clouds over
the albishorn and water inert in the low places. zurich is
not unlike an american city. missing something ever since
his arrival two days before, dick perceived that it was the
sense he had had in finite french lanes that there was nothing
more. in zurich there was a lot besides zurich—the
roofs upled the eyes to tinkling cow pastures, which in turn
modified hilltops further up—so life was a perpendicular
starting off to a postcard heaven. the alpine lands, home of
the toy and the funicular, the merry-go-round and the thin
chime, were not a being here, as in france with french
vines growing over one’s feet on the ground.
in salzburg once dick had felt the superimposed quality
of a bought and borrowed century of music; once in the
laboratories of the university in zurich, delicately poking
at the cervical of a brain, he had felt like a toy-maker rather
than like the tornado who had hurried through the old red
buildings of hopkins, two years before, unstayed by the irony
of the gigantic christ in the entrance hall.
yet he had decided to remain another two years in zurich,
for he did not underestimate the value of toy-making,
in infinite precision, of infinite patience.
to-day he went out to see franz gregorovius at dohmler’s
clinic on the zurichsee. franz, resident pathologist at 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 175
the clinic, a vaudois by birth, a few years older than dick,
met him at the tram stop. he had a dark and magnificent aspect
of cagliostro about him, contrasted with holy eyes; he
was the third of the gregoroviuses—his grandfather had instructed
krapaelin when psychiatry was just emerging from
the darkness of all time. in personality he was proud, fiery,
and sheeplike—he fancied himself as a hypnotist. if the
original genius of the family had grown a little tired, franz
would without doubt become a fine clinician.
on the way to the clinic he said: ‘tell me of your experiences
in the war. are you changed like the rest? you have
the same stupid and unaging american face, except i know
you’re not stupid, dick.’
‘i didn’t see any of the war—you must have gathered that
from my letters, franz.’
‘that doesn’t matter—we have some shell-shocks who
merely heard an air raid from a distance. we have a few
who merely read newspapers.’
‘it sounds like nonsense to me.’
‘maybe it is, dick. but, we’re a rich person’s clinic—we
don’t use the word nonsense. frankly, did you come down
to see me or to see that girl?’
they looked sideways at each other; franz smiled enigmatically.
‘naturally i saw all the first letters,’ he said in his official
basso. ‘when the change began, delicacy prevented me
from opening any more. really it had become your case.’
‘then she’s well?’ dick demanded.
‘perfectly well, i have charge of her, in fact i have charge 
176 tender is the night
of the majority of the english and american patients. they
call me doctor gregory.’
‘let me explain about that girl,’ dick said. ‘i only saw her
one time, that’s a fact. when i came out to say good-by to
you just before i went over to france. it was the first time i
put on my uniform and i felt very bogus in it—went around
saluting private soldiers and all that.’
‘why didn’t you wear it to-day?’
‘hey! i’ve been discharged three weeks. here’s the way i
happened to see that girl. when i left you i walked down toward
that building of yours on the lake to get my bicycle.’
‘—toward the ‘cedars’?’
‘—a wonderful night, you know—moon over that mountain—‘
‘the krenzegg.’
‘—i caught up with a nurse and a young girl. i didn’t
think the girl was a patient; i asked the nurse about tram
times and we walked along. the girl was about the prettiest
thing i ever saw.’
‘she still is.’
‘she’d never seen an american uniform and we talked,
and i didn’t think anything about it.’ he broke off, recognizing
a familiar perspective, and then resumed: ‘—except,
franz, i’m not as hardboiled as you are yet; when i see a
beautiful shell like that i can’t help feeling a regret about
what’s inside it. that was absolutely all—till the letters began
to come.’
‘it was the best thing that could have happened to her,’
said franz dramatically, ‘a transference of the most fortu-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 177
itous kind. that’s why i came down to meet you on a very
busy day. i want you to come into my office and talk a long
time before you see her. in fact, i sent her into zurich to
do errands.’ his voice was tense with enthusiasm. ‘in fact,
i sent her without a nurse, with a less stable patient. i’m
intensely proud of this case, which i handled, with your accidental
assistance.’
the car had followed the shore of the zurichsee into a
fertile region of pasture farms and low hills, steepled with
châlets. the sun swam out into a blue sea of sky and suddenly
it was a swiss valley at its best—pleasant sounds and
murmurs and a good fresh smell of health and cheer.
professor dohmler’s plant consisted of three old buildings
and a pair of new ones, between a slight eminence and
the shore of the lake. at its founding, ten years before, it had
been the first modern clinic for mental illness; at a casual
glance no layman would recognize it as a refuge for the broken,
the incomplete, the menacing, of this world, though
two buildings were surrounded with vine-softened walls of
a deceptive height. some men raked straw in the sunshine;
here and there, as they rode into the grounds, the car passed
the white flag of a nurse waving beside a patient on a path.
after conducting dick to his office, franz excused himself
for half an hour. left alone dick wandered about the
room and tried to reconstruct franz from the litter of his
desk, from his books and the books of and by his father and
grandfather; from the swiss piety of a huge claret-colored
photo of the former on the wall. there was smoke in the
room; pushing open a french window, dick let in a cone 
178 tender is the night
of sunshine. suddenly his thoughts swung to the patient,
the girl.
he had received about fifty letters from her written over
a period of eight months. the first one was apologetic, explaining
that she had heard from america how girls wrote
to soldiers whom they did not know. she had obtained the
name and address from doctor gregory and she hoped he
would not mind if she sometimes sent word to wish him
well, etc., etc.
so far it was easy to recognize the tone—from ‘daddy-long-legs’
and ‘molly-make-believe,’ sprightly and
sentimental epistolary collections enjoying a vogue in the
states. but there the resemblance ended.
the letters were divided into two classes, of which the
first class, up to about the time of the armistice, was of
marked pathological turn, and of which the second class,
running from thence up to the present, was entirely normal,
and displayed a richly maturing nature. for these latter letters
dick had come to wait eagerly in the last dull months at
bar-sur-aube—yet even from the first letters he had pieced
together more than franz would have guessed of the story.
mon capitaine:
i thought when i saw you in your uniform you were so
handsome. then i thought je m’en fiche french too and
german. you thought i was pretty too but i’ve had that before
and a long time i’ve stood it. if you come here again
with that attitude base and criminal and not even faintly
what i had been taught to associate with the role of gentleman
then heaven help you. however you seem quieter than 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 179
the others,
(2)
all soft like a big cat. i have only gotten to like boys who
are rather sissies. are you a sissy? there were some somewhere.
excuse all this, it is the third letter i have written you and
will send immediately or will never send. i’ve thought a lot
about moonlight too, and there are many witnesses i could
find if i could only be out of here.
(3)
they said you were a doctor, but so long as you are a cat it
is different. my head aches so, so excuse this walking there
like an ordinary with a white cat will explain, i think. i can
speak three languages, four with english, and am sure i
could be useful interpreting if you arrange such thing in
france i’m sure i could control everything with the belts all
bound around everybody like it was wednesday. it is now
saturday and
(4)
you are far away, perhaps killed.
come back to me some day, for i will be here always
on this green hill. unless they will let me write my father,
whom i loved dearly. excuse this. i am not myself today. i
will write when i feel better.
cherio
nicole warren.
excuse all this.
captain diver:
i know introspection is not good for a highly nervous 
180 tender is the night
state like mine, but i would like you to know where i stand.
last year or whenever it was in chicago when i got so i
couldn’t speak to servants or walk in the street i kept waiting
for some one to tell me. it was the duty of some one who
understood. the blind must be led. only no one would tell
me everything—they would just tell me half and i was already
too muddled to put two and two together. one man
was nice—he was a french officer and he understood. he
gave me a flower and said it was ‘plus petite et
(2)
moins entendue.’ we were friends. then he took it away.
i grew sicker and there was no one to explain to me. they
had a song about joan of arc that they used to sing at me
but that was just mean—it would just make me cry, for there
was nothing the matter with my head then. they kept making
reference to sports, too, but i didn’t care by that time. so
there was that day i went walking on michigan boulevard
on and on for miles and finally they followed me in an automobile,
but i wouldn’t get
(3)
in. finally they pulled me in and there were nurses. after
that time i began to realize it all, because i could feel what
was happening in others. so you see how i stand. and what
good can it be for me to stay here with the doctors harping
constantly in the things i was here to get over. so today
i have written my father to come and take me away. i am
glad
(4)
you are so interested in examining people and sending 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 181
them back. it must be so much fun.
and again, from another letter:
you might pass up your next examination and write me
a letter. they just sent me some phonograph records in case
i should forget my lesson and i broke them all so the nurse
won’t speak to me. they were in english, so that the nurses
would not understand. one doctor in chicago said i was
bluffing, but what he really meant was that i was a twin six
and he had never seen one before. but i was very busy being
mad then, so i didn’t care what he said, when i am very
busy being mad i don’t usually care what they say, not if i
were a million girls.
you told me that night you’d teach me to play. well, i
think love is all
(2)
there is or should be. anyhow i am glad your interest in
examinations keeps you busy.
tout à vous,
nicole warren.
there were other letters among whose helpless cæsuras
lurked darker rhythms.
dear captain diver:
i write to you because there is no one else to whom i can
turn and it seems to me if this farcicle situation is apparent
to one as sick as me it should be apparent to you. the mental
trouble is all over and besides that i am completely broken
and humiliated, if that was what they wanted. my family
have shamefully neglected me, there’s no use asking them
for help or pity. i have had enough and it is simply ruining 
182 tender is the night
my health and wasting my time pretending that what is the
matter with my
(2)
head is curable.
here i am in what appears to be a semi-insane-asylum,
all because nobody saw fit to tell me the truth about anything.
if i had only known what was going on like i know
now i could have stood it i guess for i am pretty strong, but
those who should have, did not see fit to enlighten me.
(3)
and now, when i know and have paid such a price for
knowing, they sit there with their dogs lives and say i
should believe what i did believe. especially one does but

i am lonesome all the time far away from friends and
family across the atlantic i roam all over the place in a half
daze. if you could get me a position as interpreter (i know
french and german like a native, fair

italian and a little spanish) or in the red cross ambulance
or as a trained nurse, though i would have to train you
would prove a great blessing.
and again:
since you will not accept my explanation of what is the
matter you could at least explain to me what you think, because
you have a kind cat’s face, and not that funny look
that seems to be so fashionable here. dr. gregory gave me
a snapshot of you, not as handsome as you are in your uniform,
but younger looking.

mon capitaine:
it was fine to have your postcard. i am so glad you take
such interest in disqualifying nurses—oh, i understood
your note very well indeed. only i thought from the moment
i met you that you were different.
dear capitaine:
i think one thing today and another tomorrow. that is
really all that’s the matter with me, except a crazy defiance
and a lack of proportion. i would gladly welcome any alienist
you might suggest. here they lie in their bath tubs and
sing play in your own backyard as if i had my
(2)
backyard to play in or any hope which i can find by looking
either backward or forward. they tried it again in the
candy store again and i almost hit the man with the weight,
but they held me.
i am not going to write you any more. i am too unstable.
and then a month with no letters. and then suddenly
the change.
—i am slowly coming back to life ...
—today the flowers and the clouds ...
—the war is over and i scarcely knew there was a war ...
—how kind you have been! you must be very wise behind
your face like a white cat, except you don’t look like
that in the picture dr. gregory gave me ...
—today i went to zurich, how strange a feeling to see a
city again.
—today we went to berne, it was so nice with the 
184 tender is the night
clocks.
—today we climbed high enough to find asphodel and
edelweiss ...
after that the letters were fewer, but he answered them
all. there was one:
i wish someone were in love with me like boys were ages
ago before i was sick. i suppose it will be years, though, before
i could think of anything like that.
but when dick’s answer was delayed for any reason, there
was a fluttering burst of worry—like a worry of a lover: ‘perhaps
i have bored you,’ and: ‘afraid i have presumed,’ and:
‘i keep thinking at night you have been sick.’
in actuality dick was sick with the flu. when he recovered,
all except the formal part of his correspondence was
sacrificed to the consequent fatigue, and shortly afterward
the memory of her became overlaid by the vivid presence of
a wisconsin telephone girl at headquarters in bar-sur-aube.
she was red-lipped like a poster, and known obscenely in
the messes as ‘the switchboard.’
franz came back into his office feeling self-important.
dick thought he would probably be a fine clinician, for
the sonorous or staccato cadences by which he disciplined
nurse or patient came not from his nervous system but from
a tremendous and harmless vanity. his true emotions were
more ordered and kept to himself.
‘now about the girl, dick,’ he said. ‘of course, i want to
find out about you and tell you about myself, but first about
the girl, because i have been waiting to tell you about it so
long.’

he searched for and found a sheaf of papers in a filing
cabinet but after shuffling through them he found they were
in his way and put them on his desk. instead he told dick
the story.
186 tender is the night
iii
about a year and a half before, doctor dohmler had some
vague correspondence with an american gentleman living
in lausanne, a mr. devereux warren, of the warren family
of chicago. a meeting was arranged and one day mr. warren
arrived at the clinic with his daughter nicole, a girl of
sixteen. she was obviously not well and the nurse who was
with her took her to walk about the grounds while mr. warren
had his consultation.
warren was a strikingly handsome man looking less than
forty. he was a fine american type in every way, tall, broad,
well-made—‘un homme très chic,’ as doctor dohmler described
him to franz. his large gray eyes were sun-veined
from rowing on lake geneva, and he had that special air
about him of having known the best of this world. the conversation
was in german, for it developed that he had been
educated at göttingen. he was nervous and obviously very
moved by his errand.
‘doctor dohmler, my daughter isn’t right in the head.
i’ve had lots of specialists and nurses for her and she’s taken
a couple of rest cures but the thing has grown too big for me
and i’ve been strongly recommended to come to you.’
‘very well,’ said doctor dohmler. ‘suppose you start at
the beginning and tell me everything.’
‘there isn’t any beginning, at least there isn’t any insanity 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 187
in the family that i know of, on either side. nicole’s mother
died when she was eleven and i’ve sort of been father and
mother both to her, with the help of governesses—father
and mother both to her.’
he was very moved as he said this. doctor dohmler saw
that there were tears in the corners of his eyes and noticed
for the first time that there was whiskey on his breath.
‘as a child she was a darling thing—everybody was crazy
about her, everybody that came in contact with her. she was
smart as a whip and happy as the day is long. she liked to
read or draw or dance or play the piano—anything. i used
to hear my wife say she was the only one of our children who
never cried at night. i’ve got an older girl, too, and there was
a boy that died, but nicole was— nicole was—nicole—‘
he broke off and doctor dohmler helped him.
‘she was a perfectly normal, bright, happy child.’
‘perfectly.’
doctor dohmler waited. mr. warren shook his head,
blew a long sigh, glanced quickly at doctor dohmler and
then at the floor again.
‘about eight months ago, or maybe it was six months ago
or maybe ten—i try to figure but i can’t remember exactly
where we were when she began to do funny things—crazy
things. her sister was the first one to say anything to me
about it—because nicole was always the same to me,’ he
added rather hastily, as if some one had accused him of being
to blame, ‘—the same loving little girl. the first thing
was about a valet.’
‘oh, yes,’ said doctor dohmler, nodding his venerable 
188 tender is the night
head, as if, like sherlock holmes, he had expected a valet
and only a valet to be introduced at this point.
‘i had a valet—been with me for years—swiss, by the
way.’ he looked up for doctor dohmler’s patriotic approval.
‘and she got some crazy idea about him. she thought he was
making up to her—of course, at the time i believed her and
i let him go, but i know now it was all nonsense.’
‘what did she claim he had done?’
‘that was the first thing—the doctors couldn’t pin her
down. she just looked at them as if they ought to know what
he’d done. but she certainly meant he’d made some kind of
indecent advances to her—she didn’t leave us in any doubt
of that.’
‘i see.’
‘of course, i’ve read about women getting lonesome and
thinking there’s a man under the bed and all that, but why
should nicole get such an idea? she could have all the young
men she wanted. we were in lake forest—that’s a summer
place near chicago where we have a place—and she was out
all day playing golf or tennis with boys. and some of them
pretty gone on her at that.’
all the time warren was talking to the dried old package
of doctor dohmler, one section of the latter’s mind kept
thinking intermittently of chicago. once in his youth he
could have gone to chicago as fellow and docent at the university,
and perhaps become rich there and owned his own
clinic instead of being only a minor shareholder in a clinic.
but when he had thought of what he considered his own
thin knowledge spread over that whole area, over all those 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 189
wheat fields, those endless prairies, he had decided against
it. but he had read about chicago in those days, about the
great feudal families of armour, palmer, field, crane, warren,
swift, and mccormick and many others, and since that
time not a few patients had come to him from that stratum
of chicago and new york.
‘she got worse,’ continued warren. ‘she had a fit or
something— the things she said got crazier and crazier. her
sister wrote some of them down—‘ he handed a much-folded
piece of paper to the doctor. ‘almost always about men
going to attack her, men she knew or men on the street—
anybody—‘
he told of their alarm and distress, of the horrors families
go through under such circumstances, of the ineffectual
efforts they had made in america, finally of the faith in a
change of scene that had made him run the submarine
blockade and bring his daughter to switzerland.
‘—on a united states cruiser,’ he specified with a touch of
hauteur. ‘it was possible for me to arrange that, by a stroke
of luck. and, may i add,’ he smiled apologetically, ‘that as
they say: money is no object.’
‘certainly not,’ agreed dohmler dryly.
he was wondering why and about what the man was lying
to him. or, if he was wrong about that, what was the
falsity that pervaded the whole room, the handsome figure
in tweeds sprawling in his chair with a sportsman’s ease?
that was a tragedy out there, in the february day, the young
bird with wings crushed somehow, and inside here it was all
too thin, thin and wrong.
190 tender is the night
‘i would like—to talk to her—a few minutes now,’ said
doctor dohmler, going into english as if it would bring him
closer to warren.
afterward when warren had left his daughter and returned
to lausanne, and several days had passed, the doctor
and franz entered upon nicole’s card:
diagnostic: schizophrénie. phase aiguë en décroissance.
la peur des hommes est un symptôme de la maladie, et n’est
point constitutionnelle... . le pronostic doit rester réservé.*
* diagnosis: divided personality. acute and down-hill
phase of the illness. the fear of men is a symptom of the illness
and is not at all constitutional... . the prognosis must
be reserved.
and then they waited with increasing interest as the days
passed for mr. warren’s promised second visit.
it was slow in coming. after a fortnight doctor dohmler
wrote. confronted with further silence he committed what
was for those days ‘une folie,’ and telephoned to the grand
hotel at vevey. he learned from mr. warren’s valet that he
was at the moment packing to sail for america. but reminded
that the forty francs swiss for the call would show up
on the clinic books, the blood of the tuileries guard rose
to doctor dohmler’s aid and mr. warren was got to the
phone.
‘it is—absolutely necessary—that you come. your daughter’s
health—all depends. i can take no responsibility.’
‘but look here, doctor, that’s just what you’re for. i have a
hurry call to go home!’
doctor dohmler had never yet spoken to any one so far 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 191
away but he dispatched his ultimatum so firmly into the
phone that the agonized american at the other end yielded.
half an hour after this second arrival on the zurichsee,
warren had broken down, his fine shoulders shaking with
awful sobs inside his easy fitting coat, his eyes redder than
the very sun on lake geneva, and they had the awful story.
‘it just happened,’ he said hoarsely. ‘i don’t know—i don’t
know.
‘after her mother died when she was little she used to
come into my bed every morning, sometimes she’d sleep in
my bed. i was sorry for the little thing. oh, after that, whenever
we went places in an automobile or a train we used to
hold hands. she used to sing to me. we used to say, ‘now
let’s not pay any attention to anybody else this afternoon—
let’s just have each other—for this morning you’re mine.’’
a broken sarcasm came into his voice. ‘people used to say
what a wonderful father and daughter we were—they used
to wipe their eyes. we were just like lovers—and then all
at once we were lovers—and ten minutes after it happened
i could have shot myself—except i guess i’m such a goddamned
degenerate i didn’t have the nerve to do it.’
‘then what?’ said doctor dohmler, thinking again of
chicago and of a mild pale gentleman with a pince-nez who
had looked him over in zurich thirty years before. ‘did this
thing go on?’
‘oh, no! she almost—she seemed to freeze up right away.
she’d just say, ‘never mind, never mind, daddy. it doesn’t
matter. never mind.’’
‘there were no consequences?’
192 tender is the night
‘no.’ he gave one short convulsive sob and blew his nose
several times. ‘except now there’re plenty of consequences.’
as the story concluded dohmler sat back in the focal
armchair of the middle class and said to himself sharply,
‘peasant!’—it was one of the few absolute worldly judgments
that he had permitted himself for twenty years. then
he said:
‘i would like for you to go to a hotel in zurich and spend
the night and come see me in the morning.’
‘and then what?’
doctor dohmler spread his hands wide enough to carry
a young pig.
‘chicago,’ he suggested.

‘then we knew where we stood,’ said franz. ‘dohmler told
warren we would take the case if he would agree to keep
away from his daughter indefinitely, with an absolute minimum
of five years. after warren’s first collapse, he seemed
chiefly concerned as to whether the story would ever leak
back to america.’
‘we mapped out a routine for her and waited. the prognosis
was bad—as you know, the percentage of cures, even
so-called social cures, is very low at that age.’
‘those first letters looked bad,’ agreed dick.
‘very bad—very typical. i hesitated about letting the first
one get out of the clinic. then i thought it will be good for
dick to know we’re carrying on here. it was generous of you
to answer them.’
dick sighed. ‘she was such a pretty thing—she enclosed
a lot of snapshots of herself. and for a month there i didn’t
have anything to do. all i said in my letters was ‘be a good
girl and mind the doctors.’’
‘that was enough—it gave her somebody to think of outside.
for a while she didn’t have anybody—only one sister
that she doesn’t seem very close to. besides, reading her
letters helped us here— they were a measure of her condition.’
‘i’m glad.’
194 tender is the night
‘you see now what happened? she felt complicity—that’s
neither here nor there, except as we want to revalue her ultimate
stability and strength of character. first came this
shock. then she went off to a boarding-school and heard the
girls talking—so from sheer self-protection she developed
the idea that she had had no complicity—and from there it
was easy to slide into a phantom world where all men, the
more you liked them and trusted them, the more evil—‘
‘did she ever go into the—horror directly?’
‘no, and as a matter of fact when she began to seem normal,
about october, we were in a predicament. if she had
been thirty years old we would have let her make her own
adjustment, but she was so young we were afraid she might
harden with it all twisted inside her. so doctor dohmler
said to her frankly, ‘your duty now is to yourself. this
doesn’t by any account mean the end of anything for you—
your life is just at its beginning,’ and so forth and so forth.
she really has an excellent mind, so he gave her a little freud
to read, not too much, and she was very interested. in fact,
we’ve made rather a pet of her around here. but she is reticent,’
he added; he hesitated: ‘we have wondered if in her
recent letters to you which she mailed herself from zurich,
she has said anything that would be illuminating about her
state of mind and her plans for the future.’
dick considered.
‘yes and no—i’ll bring the letters out here if you want.
she seems hopeful and normally hungry for life—even
rather romantic. sometimes she speaks of ‘the past’ as people
speak who have been in prison. but you never know 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 195
whether they refer to the crime or the imprisonment or the
whole experience. after all i’m only a sort of stuffed figure
in her life.’
‘of course, i understand your position exactly, and i express
our gratitude once again. that was why i wanted to see
you before you see her.’
dick laughed.
‘you think she’s going to make a flying leap at my person?’
‘no, not that. but i want to ask you to go very gently. you
are attractive to women, dick.’
‘then god help me! well, i’ll be gentle and repulsive—
i’ll chew garlic whenever i’m going to see her and wear a
stubble beard. i’ll drive her to cover.’
‘not garlic!’ said franz, taking him seriously. ‘you don’t
want to compromise your career. but you’re partly joking.’
‘—and i can limp a little. and there’s no real bathtub
where i’m living, anyhow.’
‘you’re entirely joking,’ franz relaxed—or rather assumed
the posture of one relaxed. ‘now tell me about
yourself and your plans?’
‘i’ve only got one, franz, and that’s to be a good psychologist—
maybe to be the greatest one that ever lived.’
franz laughed pleasantly, but he saw that this time dick
wasn’t joking.
‘that’s very good—and very american,’ he said. ‘it’s more
difficult for us.’ he got up and went to the french window.
‘i stand here and i see zurich—there is the steeple of the
grossmünster. in its vault my grandfather is buried. across 
196 tender is the night
the bridge from it lies my ancestor lavater, who would not
be buried in any church. nearby is the statue of another
ancestor, heinrich pestalozzi, and one of doctor alfred escher.
and over everything there is always zwingli—i am
continually confronted with a pantheon of heroes.’
‘yes, i see.’ dick got up. ‘i was only talking big. everything’s
just starting over. most of the americans in france
are frantic to get home, but not me—i draw military pay all
the rest of the year if i only attend lectures at the university.
how’s that for a government on the grand scale that knows
its future great men? then i’m going home for a month and
see my father. then i’m coming back—i’ve been offered a
job.’
‘where?’
‘your rivals—gisler’s clinic on interlacken.’
‘don’t touch it,’ franz advised him. ‘they’ve had a dozen
young men there in a year. gisler’s a manic-depressive himself,
his wife and her lover run the clinic—of course, you
understand that’s confidential.’
‘how about your old scheme for america?’ asked dick
lightly. ‘we were going to new york and start an up-to-date
establishment for billionaires.’
‘that was students’ talk.’
dick dined with franz and his bride and a small dog with
a smell of burning rubber, in their cottage on the edge of the
grounds, he felt vaguely oppressed, not by the atmosphere
of modest retrenchment, nor by frau gregorovius, who
might have been prophesied, but by the sudden contracting
of horizons to which franz seemed so reconciled. for 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 197
him the boundaries of asceticism were differently marked—
he could see it as a means to an end, even as a carrying on
with a glory it would itself supply, but it was hard to think
of deliberately cutting life down to the scale of an inherited
suit. the domestic gestures of franz and his wife as they
turned in a cramped space lacked grace and adventure. the
post-war months in france, and the lavish liquidations taking
place under the ægis of american splendor, had affected
dick’s outlook. also, men and women had made much of
him, and perhaps what had brought him back to the centre
of the great swiss watch, was an intuition that this was not
too good for a serious man.
he made kaethe gregorovius feel charming, meanwhile
becoming increasingly restless at the all-pervading
cauliflower— simultaneously hating himself too for this incipience
of he knew not what superficiality.
‘god, am i like the rest after all?’—so he used to think
starting awake at night—‘am i like the rest?’
this was poor material for a socialist but good material
for those who do much of the world’s rarest work. the
truth was that for some months he had been going through
that partitioning of the things of youth wherein it is decided
whether or not to die for what one no longer believes. in the
dead white hours in zurich staring into a stranger’s pantry
across the upshine of a streetlamp, he used to think that he
wanted to be good, he wanted to be kind, he wanted to be
brave and wise, but it was all pretty difficult. he wanted to
be loved, too, if he could fit it in.

the veranda of the central building was illuminated
from open french windows, save where the black shadows
of stripling walls and the fantastic shadows of iron chairs
slithered down into a gladiola bed. from the figures that
shuffled between the rooms miss warren emerged first in
glimpses and then sharply when she saw him; as she crossed
the threshold her face caught the room’s last light and
brought it outside with her. she walked to a rhythm—all
that week there had been singing in her ears, summer songs
of ardent skies and wild shade, and with his arrival the singing
had become so loud she could have joined in with it.
‘how do you do, captain,’ she said, unfastening her eyes
from his with difficulty, as though they had become entangled.
‘shall we sit out here?’ she stood still, her glance
moving about for a moment. ‘it’s summer practically.’
a woman had followed her out, a dumpy woman in a
shawl, and nicole presented dick: ‘señora—‘
franz excused himself and dick grouped three chairs together.
‘the lovely night,’ the señora said.
‘muy bella,’ agreed nicole; then to dick, ‘are you here
for a long time?’
‘i’m in zurich for a long time, if that’s what you mean.’
‘this is really the first night of real spring,’ the señora 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 199
suggested.
‘to stay?’
‘at least till july.’
‘i’m leaving in june.’
‘june is a lovely month here,’ the señora commented.
‘you should stay for june and then leave in july when it gets
really too hot.’
‘you’re going where?’ dick asked nicole.
‘somewhere with my sister—somewhere exciting, i hope,
because i’ve lost so much time. but perhaps they’ll think i
ought to go to a quiet place at first—perhaps como. why
don’t you come to como?’
‘ah, como—‘ began the señora.
within the building a trio broke into suppe’s ‘light
cavalry.’ nicole took advantage of this to stand up and the
impression of her youth and beauty grew on dick until it
welled up inside him in a compact paroxysm of emotion.
she smiled, a moving childish smile that was like all the lost
youth in the world.
‘the music’s too loud to talk against—suppose we walk
around. buenas noches, señora.’
‘g’t night—g’t night.’
they went down two steps to the path—where in a moment
a shadow cut across it. she took his arm.
‘i have some phonograph records my sister sent me from
america,’ she said. ‘next time you come here i’ll play them
for you—i know a place to put the phonograph where no
one can hear.’
‘that’ll be nice.’
200 tender is the night
‘do you know ‘hindustan’?’ she asked wistfully. ‘i’d never
heard it before, but i like it. and i’ve got ‘why do they
call them babies?’ and ‘i’m glad i can make you cry.’ i
suppose you’ve danced to all those tunes in paris?’
‘i haven’t been to paris.’
her cream-colored dress, alternately blue or gray as they
walked, and her very blonde hair, dazzled dick—whenever
he turned toward her she was smiling a little, her face lighting
up like an angel’s when they came into the range of a
roadside arc. she thanked him for everything, rather as if he
had taken her to some party, and as dick became less and
less certain of his relation to her, her confidence increased—
there was that excitement about her that seemed to reflect
all the excitement of the world.
‘i’m not under any restraint at all,’ she said. ‘i’ll play you
two good tunes called ‘wait till the cows come home’ and
‘good-by, alexander.’’
he was late the next time, a week later, and nicole was
waiting for him at a point in the path which he would pass
walking from franz’s house. her hair drawn back of her ears
brushed her shoulders in such a way that the face seemed to
have just emerged from it, as if this were the exact moment
when she was coming from a wood into clear moonlight.
the unknown yielded her up; dick wished she had no background,
that she was just a girl lost with no address save
the night from which she had come. they went to the cache
where she had left the phonograph, turned a corner by the
workshop, climbed a rock, and sat down behind a low wall,
facing miles and miles of rolling night.

they were in america now, even franz with his conception
of dick as an irresistible lothario would never have
guessed that they had gone so far away. they were so sorry,
dear; they went down to meet each other in a taxi, honey;
they had preferences in smiles and had met in hindustan,
and shortly afterward they must have quarrelled, for nobody
knew and nobody seemed to care—yet finally one of
them had gone and left the other crying, only to feel blue,
to feel sad.
the thin tunes, holding lost times and future hopes in
liaison, twisted upon the valais night. in the lulls of the
phonograph a cricket held the scene together with a single
note. by and by nicole stopped playing the machine and
sang to him.
“lay a silver dollar
on the ground
and watch it roll
because it’s round—‘
on the pure parting of her lips no breath hovered. dick
stood up suddenly.
‘what’s the matter, you don’t like it?’
‘of course i do.’
‘our cook at home taught it to me:
“a woman never knows
what a good man she’s got
till after she turns him down ...’
202 tender is the night
‘you like it?’
she smiled at him, making sure that the smile gathered
up everything inside her and directed it toward him, making
him a profound promise of herself for so little, for the
beat of a response, the assurance of a complimentary vibration
in him. minute by minute the sweetness drained down
into her out of the willow trees, out of the dark world.
she stood up too, and stumbling over the phonograph,
was momentarily against him, leaning into the hollow of his
rounded shoulder.
‘i’ve got one more record,’ she said. ‘—have you heard
‘so long, letty’? i suppose you have.’
‘honestly, you don’t understand—i haven’t heard a
thing.’
nor known, nor smelt, nor tasted, he might have added;
only hotcheeked girls in hot secret rooms. the young maidens
he had known at new haven in 1914 kissed men, saying
‘there!’, hands at the man’s chest to push him away. now
there was this scarcely saved waif of disaster bringing him
the essence of a continent... .

it was may when he next found her. the luncheon in zurich
was a council of caution; obviously the logic of his life
tended away from the girl; yet when a stranger stared at her
from a nearby table, eyes burning disturbingly like an uncharted
light, he turned to the man with an urbane version
of intimidation and broke the regard.
‘he was just a peeper,’ he explained cheerfully. ‘he was
just looking at your clothes. why do you have so many different
clothes?’
‘sister says we’re very rich,’ she offered humbly. ‘since
grandmother is dead.’
‘i forgive you.’
he was enough older than nicole to take pleasure in her
youthful vanities and delights, the way she paused fractionally
in front of the hall mirror on leaving the restaurant,
so that the incorruptible quicksilver could give her back
to herself. he delighted in her stretching out her hands to
new octaves now that she found herself beautiful and rich.
he tried honestly to divorce her from any obsession that he
had stitched her together—glad to see her build up happiness
and confidence apart from him; the difficulty was that,
eventually, nicole brought everything to his feet, gifts of
sacrificial ambrosia, of worshipping myrtle.
the first week of summer found dick re-established in 
204 tender is the night
zurich. he had arranged his pamphlets and what work he
had done in the service into a pattern from which he intended
to make his revise of ‘a psychology for psychiatrists.’
he thought he had a publisher; he had established contact
with a poor student who would iron out his errors in german.
franz considered it a rash business, but dick pointed
out the disarming modesty of the theme.
‘this is stuff i’ll never know so well again,’ he insisted. ‘i
have a hunch it’s a thing that only fails to be basic because
it’s never had material recognition. the weakness of this
profession is its attraction for the man a little crippled and
broken. within the walls of the profession he compensates
by tending toward the clinical, the ‘practical’—he has won
his battle without a struggle.
‘on the contrary, you are a good man, franz, because
fate selected you for your profession before you were born.
you better thank god you had no ‘bent’—i got to be a psychiatrist
because there was a girl at st. hilda’s in oxford
that went to the same lectures. maybe i’m getting trite but
i don’t want to let my current ideas slide away with a few
dozen glasses of beer.’
‘all right,’ franz answered. ‘you are an american. you
can do this without professional harm. i do not like these
generalities. soon you will be writing little books called
‘deep thoughts for the layman,’ so simplified that they are
positively guaranteed not to cause thinking. if my father
were alive he would look at you and grunt, dick. he would
take his napkin and fold it so, and hold his napkin ring, this
very one—‘ he held it up, a boar’s head was carved in the 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 205
brown wood—‘and he would say, ‘well my impression is—‘
then he would look at you and think suddenly ‘what is the
use?’ then he would stop and grunt again; then we would be
at the end of dinner.’
‘i am alone to-day,’ said dick testily. ‘but i may not be
alone to-morrow. after that i’ll fold up my napkin like your
father and grunt.’
franz waited a moment.
‘how about our patient?’ he asked.
‘i don’t know.’
‘well, you should know about her by now.’
‘i like her. she’s attractive. what do you want me to do—
take her up in the edelweiss?’
‘no, i thought since you go in for scientific books you
might have an idea.’
‘—devote my life to her?’
franz called his wife in the kitchen: ‘du lieber gott!
bitte, bringe dick noch ein glas-bier.’
‘i don’t want any more if i’ve got to see dohmler.’
‘we think it’s best to have a program. four weeks have
passed away—apparently the girl is in love with you. that’s
not our business if we were in the world, but here in the
clinic we have a stake in the matter.’
‘i’ll do whatever doctor dohmler says,’ dick agreed.
but he had little faith that dohmler would throw much
light on the matter; he himself was the incalculable element
involved. by no conscious volition of his own, the thing had
drifted into his hands. it reminded him of a scene in his
childhood when everyone in the house was looking for the 
206 tender is the night
lost key to the silver closet, dick knowing he had hid it under
the handkerchiefs in his mother’s top drawer; at that
time he had experienced a philosophical detachment, and
this was repeated now when he and franz went together to
professor dohmler’s office.
the professor, his face beautiful under straight whiskers,
like a vine-overgrown veranda of some fine old house, disarmed
him. dick knew some individuals with more talent,
but no person of a class qualitatively superior to dohmler.
—six months later he thought the same way when he saw
dohmler dead, the light out on the veranda, the vines of his
whiskers tickling his stiff white collar, the many battles that
had swayed before the chink-like eyes stilled forever under
the frail delicate lids—
‘... good morning, sir.’ he stood formally, thrown back
to the army.
professor dohmler interlaced his tranquil fingers. franz
spoke in terms half of liaison officer, half of secretary, till his
senior cut through him in mid-sentence.
‘we have gone a certain way,’ he said mildly. ‘it’s you,
doctor diver, who can best help us now.’
routed out, dick confessed: ‘i’m not so straight on it myself.’
‘i have nothing to do with your personal reactions,’ said
dohmler. ‘but i have much to do with the fact that this socalled
‘transference,’’ he darted a short ironic look at franz
which the latter returned in kind, ‘must be terminated. miss
nicole does well indeed, but she is in no condition to survive
what she might interpret as a tragedy.’

again franz began to speak, but doctor dohmler motioned
him silent.
‘i realize that your position has been difficult.’
‘yes, it has.’
now the professor sat back and laughed, saying on the
last syllable of his laughter, with his sharp little gray eyes
shining through: ‘perhaps you have got sentimentally involved
yourself.’
aware that he was being drawn on, dick, too, laughed.
‘she’s a pretty girl—anybody responds to that to a certain
extent. i have no intention—‘
again franz tried to speak—again dohmler stopped
him with a question directed pointedly at dick. ‘have you
thought of going away?’
‘i can’t go away.’
doctor dohmler turned to franz: ‘then we can send
miss warren away.’
‘as you think best, professor dohmler,’ dick conceded.
‘it’s certainly a situation.’
professor dohmler raised himself like a legless man
mounting a pair of crutches.
‘but it is a professional situation,’ he cried quietly.
he sighed himself back into his chair, waiting for the reverberating
thunder to die out about the room. dick saw
that dohmler had reached his climax, and he was not sure
that he himself had survived it. when the thunder had diminished
franz managed to get his word in.
‘doctor diver is a man of fine character,’ he said. ‘i feel
he only has to appreciate the situation in order to deal cor-
208 tender is the night
rectly with it. in my opinion dick can co-operate right here,
without any one going away.’
‘how do you feel about that?’ professor dohmler asked
dick.
dick felt churlish in the face of the situation; at the same
time he realized in the silence after dohmler’s pronouncement
that the state of inanimation could not be indefinitely
prolonged; suddenly he spilled everything.
‘i’m half in love with her—the question of marrying her
has passed through my mind.’
‘tch! tch!’ uttered franz.
‘wait.’ dohmler warned him. franz refused to wait:
‘what! and devote half your life to being doctor and nurse
and all—never! i know what these cases are. one time in
twenty it’s finished in the first push—better never see her
again!’
‘what do you think?’ dohmler asked dick.
‘of course franz is right.’

it was late afternoon when they wound up the discussion
as to what dick should do, he must be most kind and
yet eliminate himself. when the doctors stood up at last,
dick’s eyes fell outside the window to where a light rain was
falling—nicole was waiting, expectant, somewhere in that
rain. when, presently, he went out buttoning his oil-skin at
the throat, pulling down the brim of his hat, he came upon
her immediately under the roof of the main entrance.
‘i know a new place we can go,’ she said. ‘when i was ill
i didn’t mind sitting inside with the others in the evening—
what they said seemed like everything else. naturally now i
see them as ill and it’s—it’s—‘
‘you’ll be leaving soon.’
‘oh, soon. my sister, beth, but she’s always been called
baby, she’s coming in a few weeks to take me somewhere;
after that i’ll be back here for a last month.’
‘the older sister?’
‘oh, quite a bit older. she’s twenty-four—she’s very english.
she lives in london with my father’s sister. she was
engaged to an englishman but he was killed—i never saw
him.’
her face, ivory gold against the blurred sunset that strove
through the rain, had a promise dick had never seen before:
the high cheekbones, the faintly wan quality, cool rather 
210 tender is the night
than feverish, was reminiscent of the frame of a promising
colt—a creature whose life did not promise to be only
a projection of youth upon a grayer screen, but instead, a
true growing; the face would be handsome in middle life; it
would be handsome in old age: the essential structure and
the economy were there.
‘what are you looking at?’
‘i was just thinking that you’re going to be rather happy.’
nicole was frightened: ‘am i? all right—things couldn’t
be worse than they have been.’
in the covered woodshed to which she had led him, she sat
crosslegged upon her golf shoes, her burberry wound about
her and her cheeks stung alive by the damp air. gravely
she returned his gaze, taking in his somewhat proud carriage
that never quite yielded to the wooden post against
which he leaned; she looked into his face that always tried
to discipline itself into molds of attentive seriousness, after
excursions into joys and mockeries of its own. that part of
him which seemed to fit his reddish irish coloring she knew
least; she was afraid of it, yet more anxious to explore—this
was his more masculine side: the other part, the trained
part, the consideration in the polite eyes, she expropriated
without question, as most women did.
‘at least this institution has been good for languages,’
said nicole. ‘i’ve spoken french with two doctors, and german
with the nurses, and italian, or something like it, with
a couple of scrubwomen and one of the patients, and i’ve
picked up a lot of spanish from another.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 211
‘that’s fine.’
he tried to arrange an attitude but no logic seemed
forthcoming.
‘—music too. hope you didn’t think i was only interested
in ragtime. i practise every day—the last few months
i’ve been taking a course in zurich on the history of music.
in fact it was all that kept me going at times—music and
the drawing.’ she leaned suddenly and twisted a loose strip
from the sole of her shoe and then looked up. ‘i’d like to
draw you just the way you are now.’
it made him sad when she brought out her accomplishments
for his approval.
‘i envy you. at present i don’t seem to be interested in
anything except my work.’
‘oh, i think that’s fine for a man,’ she said quickly. ‘but
for a girl i think she ought to have lots of minor accomplishments
and pass them on to her children.’
‘i suppose so,’ said dick with deliberated indifference.
nicole sat quiet. dick wished she would speak so that
he could play the easy rôle of wet blanket, but now she sat
quiet.
‘you’re all well,’ he said. ‘try to forget the past; don’t
overdo things for a year or so. go back to america and be a
débutante and fall in love—and be happy.’
‘i couldn’t fall in love.’ her injured shoe scraped a cocoon
of dust from the log on which she sat.
‘sure you can,’ dick insisted. ‘not for a year maybe, but
sooner or later.’ then he added brutally: ‘you can have a perfectly
normal life with a houseful of beautiful descendants. 
212 tender is the night
the very fact that you could make a complete comeback
at your age proves that the precipitating factors were pretty
near everything. young woman, you’ll be pulling your
weight long after your friends are carried off screaming.’
—but there was a look of pain in her eyes as she took the
rough dose, the harsh reminder.
‘i know i wouldn’t be fit to marry any one for a long time,’
she said humbly.
dick was too upset to say any more. he looked out into
the grain field trying to recover his hard brassy attitude.
‘you’ll be all right—everybody here believes in you. why,
doctor gregory is so proud of you that he’ll probably—‘
‘i hate doctor gregory.’
‘well, you shouldn’t.’
nicole’s world had fallen to pieces, but it was only a flimsy
and scarcely created world; beneath it her emotions and
instincts fought on. was it an hour ago she had waited by
the entrance, wearing her hope like a corsage at her belt?
... dress stay crisp for him, button stay put, bloom narcissus—
air stay still and sweet.
‘it will be nice to have fun again,’ she fumbled on. for a
moment she entertained a desperate idea of telling him how
rich she was, what big houses she lived in, that really she was
a valuable property—for a moment she made herself into
her grandfather, sid warren, the horse-trader. but she survived
the temptation to confuse all values and shut these
matters into their victorian side-chambers—even though
there was no home left to her, save emptiness and pain.
‘i have to go back to the clinic. it’s not raining now.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 213
dick walked beside her, feeling her unhappiness, and
wanting to drink the rain that touched her cheek.
‘i have some new records,’ she said. ‘i can hardly wait to
play them. do you know—‘
after supper that evening, dick thought, he would finish
the break; also he wanted to kick franz’s bottom for having
partially introduced him to such a sordid business. he
waited in the hall. his eyes followed a beret, not wet with
waiting like nicole’s beret, but covering a skull recently operated
on. beneath it human eyes peered, found him and
came over:
‘bonjour, docteur.’
‘bonjour, monsieur.’
‘il fait beau temps.’
‘oui, merveilleux.’
‘vous êtes ici maintenant?’
‘non, pour la journée seulement.’
‘ah, bon. alors—au revoir, monsieur.’
glad at having survived another contact, the wretch in
the beret moved away. dick waited. presently a nurse came
downstairs and delivered him a message.
‘miss warren asks to be excused, doctor. she wants to lie
down. she wants to have dinner upstairs to-night.’
the nurse hung on his response, half expecting him to
imply that miss warren’s attitude was pathological.
‘oh, i see. well—‘ he rearranged the flow of his own saliva,
the pulse of his heart. ‘i hope she feels better. thanks.’
he was puzzled and discontent. at any rate it freed him.
leaving a note for franz begging off from supper, he 
214 tender is the night
walked through the countryside to the tram station. as he
reached the platform, with spring twilight gilding the rails
and the glass in the slot machines, he began to feel that the
station, the hospital, was hovering between being centripetal
and centrifugal. he felt frightened. he was glad when
the substantial cobble-stones of zurich clicked once more
under his shoes.
he expected to hear from nicole next day but there was
no word. wondering if she was ill, he called the clinic and
talked to franz.
‘she came downstairs to luncheon yesterday and to-day,’
said franz. ‘she seemed a little abstracted and in the clouds.
how did it go off?’
dick tried to plunge over the alpine crevasse between
the sexes.
‘we didn’t get to it—at least i didn’t think we did. i tried
to be distant, but i didn’t think enough happened to change
her attitude if it ever went deep.’
perhaps his vanity had been hurt that there was no coup
de grâce to administer.
‘from some things she said to her nurse i’m inclined to
think she understood.’
‘all right.’
‘it was the best thing that could have happened. she
doesn’t seem over-agitated—only a little in the clouds.’
‘all right, then.’
‘dick, come soon and see me.’

during the next weeks dick experienced a vast dissatisfaction.
the pathological origin and mechanistic defeat of
the affair left a flat and metallic taste. nicole’s emotions had
been used unfairly— what if they turned out to have been
his own? necessarily he must absent himself from felicity
a while—in dreams he saw her walking on the clinic path
swinging her wide straw hat... .
one time he saw her in person; as he walked past the palace
hotel, a magnificent rolls curved into the half-moon
entrance. small within its gigantic proportions, and buoyed
up by the power of a hundred superfluous horses, sat nicole
and a young woman whom he assumed was her sister. nicole
saw him and momentarily her lips parted in an expression of
fright. dick shifted his hat and passed, yet for a moment the
air around him was loud with the circlings of all the goblins
on the gross-münster. he tried to write the matter out of his
mind in a memorandum that went into detail as to the solemn
régime before her; the possibilities of another ‘push’ of
the malady under the stresses which the world would inevitably
supply—in all a memorandum that would have been
convincing to any one save to him who had written it.
the total value of this effort was to make him realize
once more how far his emotions were involved; thenceforth
he resolutely provided antidotes. one was the telephone 
216 tender is the night
girl from bar-sur-aube, now touring europe from nice to
coblenz, in a desperate roundup of the men she had known
in her never-to-be-equalled holiday; another was the making
of arrangements to get home on a government transport
in august; a third was a consequent intensification of work
on his proofs for the book that this autumn was to be presented
to the german-speaking world of psychiatry.
dick had outgrown the book; he wanted now to do more
spade work; if he got an exchange fellowship he could count
on plenty of routine.
meanwhile he had projected a new work: an attempt at
a uniform and pragmatic classification of the neuroses and
psychoses, based on an examination of fifteen hundred
pre-krapælin and post-krapælin cases as they would be
diagnosed in the terminology of the different contemporary
schools—and another sonorous paragraph—together
with a chronology of such subdivisions of opinion as have
arisen independently.
this title would look monumental in german.*
*ein versuch die neurosen und psychosen gleichmässig
und pragmatisch zu klassifizieren auf grund der
untersuchung von fünfzehn hundert pre-krapaelin und
post-krapaelin fällen wie siz diagnostiziert sein würden in
der terminologie von den verschiedenen schulen der gegenwart—and
another sonorous paragraph—zusammen
mit einer chronologic solcher subdivisionen der meinung
welche unabhängig entstanden sind.
going into montreux dick pedalled slowly, gaping at
the jugenhorn whenever possible, and blinded by glimpses 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 217
of the lake through the alleys of the shore hotels. he was
conscious of the groups of english, emergent after four years
and walking with detective-story suspicion in their eyes, as
though they were about to be assaulted in this questionable
country by german trained-bands. there were building and
awakening everywhere on this mound of débris formed by
a mountain torrent. at berne and at lausanne on the way
south, dick had been eagerly asked if there would be americans
this year. ‘by august, if not in june?’
he wore leather shorts, an army shirt, mountain shoes.
in his knapsack were a cotton suit and a change of underwear.
at the glion funicular he checked his bicycle and took
a small beer on the terrace of the station buffet, meanwhile
watching the little bug crawl down the eighty-degree slope of
the hill. his ear was full of dried blood from la tour de pelz,
where he had sprinted under the impression that he was a
spoiled athlete. he asked for alcohol and cleared up the exterior
while the funicular slid down port. he saw his bicycle
embarked, slung his knapsack into the lower compartment
of the car, and followed it in.
mountain-climbing cars are built on a slant similar to the
angle of a hat-brim of a man who doesn’t want to be recognized.
as water gushed from the chamber under the car,
dick was impressed with the ingenuity of the whole idea—a
complimentary car was now taking on mountain water at
the top and would pull the lightened car up by gravity, as
soon as the brakes were released. it must have been a great
inspiration. in the seat across, a couple of british were discussing
the cable itself.
218 tender is the night
‘the ones made in england always last five or six years.
two years ago the germans underbid us, and how long do
you think their cable lasted?’
‘how long?’
‘a year and ten months. then the swiss sold it to the italians.
they don’t have rigid inspections of cables.’
‘i can see it would be a terrible thing for switzerland if a
cable broke.’
the conductor shut a door; he telephoned his confrere
among the undulati, and with a jerk the car was pulled upward,
heading for a pinpoint on an emerald hill above. after
it cleared the low roofs, the skies of vaud, valais, swiss savoy,
and geneva spread around the passengers in cyclorama.
on the centre of the lake, cooled by the piercing current of
the rhône, lay the true centre of the western world. upon it
floated swans like boats and boats like swans, both lost in the
nothingness of the heartless beauty. it was a bright day, with
sun glittering on the grass beach below and the white courts
of the kursal. the figures on the courts threw no shadows.
when chillon and the island palace of salagnon came
into view dick turned his eyes inward. the funicular was
above the highest houses of the shore; on both sides a tangle
of foliage and flowers culminated at intervals in masses of
color. it was a rail-side garden, and in the car was a sign:
défense de cueillir les fleurs.
though one must not pick flowers on the way up, the
blossoms trailed in as they passed—dorothy perkins roses
dragged patiently through each compartment slowly waggling
with the motion of the funicular, letting go at the last 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 219
to swing back to their rosy cluster. again and again these
branches went through the car.
in the compartment above and in front of dick’s, a group
of english were standing up and exclaiming upon the backdrop
of sky, when suddenly there was a confusion among
them—they parted to give passage to a couple of young people
who made apologies and scrambled over into the rear
compartment of the funicular—dick’s compartment. the
young man was a latin with the eyes of a stuffed deer; the
girl was nicole.
the two climbers gasped momentarily from their efforts;
as they settled into seats, laughing and crowding the english
to the corners, nicole said, ‘hel-lo.’ she was lovely to
look at; immediately dick saw that something was different;
in a second he realized it was her fine-spun hair, bobbed
like irene castle’s and fluffed into curls. she wore a sweater
of powder blue and a white tennis skirt—she was the first
morning in may and every taint of the clinic was departed.
‘plunk!’ she gasped. ‘whoo-oo that guard. they’ll arrest
us at the next stop. doctor diver, the conte de marmora.’
‘gee-imminy!’ she felt her new hair, panting. ‘sister
bought first-class tickets—it’s a matter of principle with her.’
she and marmora exchanged glances and shouted: ‘then
we found that firstclass is the hearse part behind the chauffeur—shut
in with curtains for a rainy day, so you can’t see
anything. but sister’s very dignified—‘ again nicole and
marmora laughed with young intimacy.
‘where you bound?’ asked dick.
‘caux. you too?’ nicole looked at his costume. ‘that your 
220 tender is the night
bicycle they got up in front?’
‘yes. i’m going to coast down monday.’
‘with me on your handle-bars? i mean, really—will you?
i can’t think of more fun.’
‘but i will carry you down in my arms,’ marmora protested
intensely. ‘i will roller-skate you—or i will throw you
and you will fall slowly like a feather.’
the delight in nicole’s face—to be a feather again instead
of a plummet, to float and not to drag. she was a carnival
to watch—at times primly coy, posing, grimacing and gesturing—sometimes
the shadow fell and the dignity of old
suffering flowed down into her finger tips. dick wished himself
away from her, fearing that he was a reminder of a world
well left behind. he resolved to go to the other hotel.
when the funicular came to rest those new to it stirred in
suspension between the blues of two heavens. it was merely
for a mysterious exchange between the conductor of the car
going up and the conductor of the car coming down. then
up and up over a forest path and a gorge—then again up a
hill that became solid with narcissus, from passengers to sky.
the people in montreux playing tennis in the lakeside courts
were pinpoints now. something new was in the air; freshness—freshness
embodying itself in music as the car slid
into glion and they heard the orchestra in the hotel garden.
when they changed to the mountain train the music was
drowned by the rushing water released from the hydraulic
chamber. almost overhead was caux, where the thousand
windows of a hotel burned in the late sun.
but the approach was different—a leather-lunged engine 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 221
pushed the passengers round and round in a corkscrew,
mounting, rising; they chugged through low-level clouds
and for a moment dick lost nicole’s face in the spray of the
slanting donkey engine; they skirted a lost streak of wind
with the hotel growing in size at each spiral, until with a vast
surprise they were there, on top of the sunshine.
in the confusion of arrival, as dick slung his knapsack
and started forward on the platform to get his bicycle, nicole
was beside him.
‘aren’t you at our hotel?’ she asked.
‘i’m economizing.’
‘will you come down and have dinner?’ some confusion
with baggage ensued. ‘this is my sister—doctor diver from
zurich.’
dick bowed to a young woman of twenty-five, tall and
confident. she was both formidable and vulnerable, he decided,
remembering other women with flower-like mouths
grooved for bits.
‘i’ll drop in after dinner,’ dick promised. ‘first i must get
acclimated.’
he wheeled off his bicycle, feeling nicole’s eyes following
him, feeling her helpless first love, feeling it twist around inside
him. he went three hundred yards up the slope to the
other hotel, he engaged a room and found himself washing
without a memory of the intervening ten minutes, only
a sort of drunken flush pierced with voices, unimportant
voices that did not know how much he was loved.
222 tender is the night
ix
they were waiting for him and incomplete without him.
he was still the incalculable element; miss warren and the
young italian wore their anticipation as obviously as nicole.
the salon of the hotel, a room of fabled acoustics, was
stripped for dancing but there was a small gallery of englishwomen
of a certain age, with neckbands, dyed hair and
faces powdered pinkish gray; and of american women of a
certain age, with snowy-white transformations, black dresses
and lips of cherry red. miss warren and marmora were
at a corner table—nicole was diagonally across from them
forty yards away, and as dick arrived he heard her voice:
‘can you hear me? i’m speaking naturally.’
‘perfectly,’
‘hello, doctor diver.’
‘what’s this?’
‘you realize the people in the centre of the floor can’t
hear what i say, but you can?’
‘a waiter told us about it,’ said miss warren. ‘corner to
corner— it’s like wireless.’
it was exciting up on the mountain, like a ship at sea.
presently marmora’s parents joined them. they treated the
warrens with respect—dick gathered that their fortunes
had something to do with a bank in milan that had something
to do with the warren fortunes. but baby warren 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 223
wanted to talk to dick, wanted to talk to him with the impetus
that sent her out vagrantly toward all new men, as
though she were on an inelastic tether and considered that
she might as well get to the end of it as soon as possible. she
crossed and recrossed her knees frequently in the manner
of tall restless virgins.
‘—nicole told me that you took part care of her, and had
a lot to do with her getting well. what i can’t understand is
what we’re supposed to do—they were so indefinite at the
sanitarium; they only told me she ought to be natural and
gay. i knew the marmoras were up here so i asked tino to
meet us at the funicular. and you see what happens—the
very first thing nicole has him crawling over the sides of the
car as if they were both insane—‘
‘that was absolutely normal,’ dick laughed. ‘i’d call it a
good sign. they were showing off for each other.’
‘but how can i tell? before i knew it, almost in front of
my eyes, she had her hair cut off, in zurich, because of a picture
in ‘vanity fair.’’
‘that’s all right. she’s a schizoid—a permanent eccentric.
you can’t change that.’
‘what is it?’
‘just what i said—an eccentric.’
‘well, how can any one tell what’s eccentric and what’s
crazy?’
‘nothing is going to be crazy—nicole is all fresh and
happy, you needn’t be afraid.’
baby shifted her knees about—she was a compendium
of all the discontented women who had loved byron a hun-
224 tender is the night
dred years before, yet, in spite of the tragic affair with the
guards’ officer there was something wooden and onanistic
about her.
‘i don’t mind the responsibility,’ she declared, ‘but i’m
in the air. we’ve never had anything like this in the family
before—we know nicole had some shock and my opinion is
it was about a boy, but we don’t really know. father says he
would have shot him if he could have found out.’
the orchestra was playing ‘poor butterfly”; young marmora
was dancing with his mother. it was a tune new
enough to them all. listening, and watching nicole’s shoulders
as she chattered to the elder marmora, whose hair was
dashed with white like a piano keyboard, dick thought of
the shoulders of a violin, and then he thought of the dishonor,
the secret. oh, butterfly—the moments pass into
hours—
‘actually i have a plan,’ baby continued with apologetic
hardness. ‘it may seem absolutely impractical to you but
they say nicole will need to be looked after for a few years. i
don’t know whether you know chicago or not—‘
‘i don’t.’
‘well, there’s a north side and a south side and they’re
very much separated. the north side is chic and all that,
and we’ve always lived over there, at least for many years,
but lots of old families, old chicago families, if you know
what i mean, still live on the south side. the university
is there. i mean it’s stuffy to some people, but anyhow it’s
different from the north side. i don’t know whether you understand.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 225
he nodded. with some concentration he had been able
to follow her.
‘now of course we have lots of connections there—father
controls certain chairs and fellowships and so forth at the
university, and i thought if we took nicole home and threw
her with that crowd—you see she’s quite musical and speaks
all these languages—what could be better in her condition
than if she fell in love with some good doctor—‘
a burst of hilarity surged up in dick, the warrens were
going to buy nicole a doctor—you got a nice doctor you can
let us use? there was no use worrying about nicole when
they were in the position of being able to buy her a nice
young doctor, the paint scarcely dry on him.
‘but how about the doctor?’ he said automatically.
‘there must be many who’d jump at the chance.’
the dancers were back, but baby whispered quickly:
‘this is the sort of thing i mean. now where is nicole—
she’s gone off somewhere. is she upstairs in her room? what
am i supposed to do? i never know whether it’s something
innocent or whether i ought to go find her.’
‘perhaps she just wants to be by herself—people living
alone get used to loneliness.’ seeing that miss warren was
not listening he stopped. ‘i’ll take a look around.’
for a moment all the outdoors shut in with mist was like
spring with the curtains drawn. life was gathered near the
hotel. dick passed some cellar windows where bus boys
sat on bunks and played cards over a litre of spanish wine.
as he approached the promenade, the stars began to come
through the white crests of the high alps. on the horseshoe 
226 tender is the night
walk overlooking the lake nicole was the figure motionless
between two lamp stands, and he approached silently across
the grass. she turned to him with an expression of: ‘here
you are,’ and for a moment he was sorry he had come.
‘your sister wondered.’
‘oh!’ she was accustomed to being watched. with an effort
she explained herself: ‘sometimes i get a little—it gets a
little too much. i’ve lived so quietly. to-night that music was
too much. it made me want to cry—‘
‘i understand.’
‘this has been an awfully exciting day.’
‘i know.’
‘i don’t want to do anything anti-social—i’ve caused
everybody enough trouble. but to-night i wanted to get
away.’
it occurred to dick suddenly, as it might occur to a dying
man that he had forgotten to tell where his will was, that
nicole had been ‘re-educated’ by dohmler and the ghostly
generations behind him; it occurred to him also that there
would be so much she would have to be told. but having
recorded this wisdom within himself, he yielded to the insistent
face-value of the situation and said:
‘you’re a nice person—just keep using your own judgment
about yourself.’
‘you like me?’
‘of course.’
‘would you—‘ they were strolling along toward the dim
end of the horseshoe, two hundred yards ahead. ‘if i hadn’t
been sick would you—i mean, would i have been the sort of 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 227
girl you might have—oh, slush, you know what i mean.’
he was in for it now, possessed by a vast irrationality. she
was so near that he felt his breathing change but again his
training came to his aid in a boy’s laugh and a trite remark.
‘you’re teasing yourself, my dear. once i knew a man
who fell in love with his nurse—‘ the anecdote rambled on,
punctuated by their footsteps. suddenly nicole interrupted
in succinct chicagoese: ‘bull!’
‘that’s a very vulgar expression.’
‘what about it?’ she flared up. ‘you don’t think i’ve got
any common sense—before i was sick i didn’t have any, but
i have now. and if i don’t know you’re the most attractive
man i ever met you must think i’m still crazy. it’s my hard
luck, all right—but don’t pretend i don’t know—i know
everything about you and me.’
dick was at an additional disadvantage. he remembered
the statement of the elder miss warren as to the young doctors
that could be purchased in the intellectual stockyards
of the south side of chicago, and he hardened for a moment.
‘you’re a fetching kid, but i couldn’t fall in love.’
‘you won’t give me a chance.’
‘what!’
the impertinence, the right to invade implied, astounded
him. short of anarchy he could not think of any chance
that nicole warren deserved.
‘give me a chance now.’
the voice fell low, sank into her breast and stretched the
tight bodice over her heart as she came up close. he felt the
young lips, her body sighing in relief against the arm grow-
228 tender is the night
ing stronger to hold her. there were now no more plans
than if dick had arbitrarily made some indissoluble mixture,
with atoms joined and inseparable; you could throw it
all out but never again could they fit back into atomic scale.
as he held her and tasted her, and as she curved in further
and further toward him, with her own lips, new to herself,
drowned and engulfed in love, yet solaced and triumphant,
he was thankful to have an existence at all, if only as a reflection
in her wet eyes.
‘my god,’ he gasped, ‘you’re fun to kiss.’
that was talk, but nicole had a better hold on him now
and she held it; she turned coquette and walked away, leaving
him as suspended as in the funicular of the afternoon.
she felt: there, that’ll show him, how conceited; how he
could do with me; oh, wasn’t it wonderful! i’ve got him,
he’s mine. now in the sequence came flight, but it was all
so sweet and new that she dawdled, wanting to draw all of
it in.
she shivered suddenly. two thousand feet below she saw
the necklace and bracelet of lights that were montreux and
vevey, beyond them a dim pendant of lausanne. from down
there somewhere ascended a faint sound of dance music.
nicole was up in her head now, cool as cool, trying to collate
the sentimentalities of her childhood, as deliberate as a man
getting drunk after battle. but she was still afraid of dick,
who stood near her, leaning, characteristically, against the
iron fence that rimmed the horseshoe; and this prompted
her to say: ‘i can remember how i stood waiting for you in
the garden—holding all my self in my arms like a basket of 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 229
flowers. it was that to me anyhow—i thought i was sweet—
waiting to hand that basket to you.’
he breathed over her shoulder and turned her insistently
about; she kissed him several times, her face getting big
every time she came close, her hands holding him by the
shoulders.
‘it’s raining hard.’
suddenly there was a booming from the wine slopes
across the lake; cannons were shooting at hail-bearing
clouds in order to break them. the lights of the promenade
went off, went on again. then the storm came swiftly, first
falling from the heavens, then doubly falling in torrents
from the mountains and washing loud down the roads
and stone ditches; with it came a dark, frightening sky and
savage filaments of lightning and world-splitting thunder,
while ragged, destroying clouds fled along past the hotel.
mountains and lake disappeared—the hotel crouched amid
tumult, chaos and darkness.
by this time dick and nicole had reached the vestibule,
where baby warren and the three marmoras were anxiously
awaiting them. it was exciting coming out of the wet
fog—with the doors banging, to stand and laugh and quiver
with emotion, wind in their ears and rain on their clothes.
now in the ballroom the orchestra was playing a strauss
waltz, high and confusing.
... for doctor diver to marry a mental patient? how did
it happen? where did it begin?
‘won’t you come back after you’ve changed?’ baby warren
asked after a close scrutiny.
230 tender is the night
‘i haven’t got any change, except some shorts.’
as he trudged up to his hotel in a borrowed raincoat he
kept laughing derisively in his throat.
‘big chance—oh, yes. my god!—they decided to buy
a doctor? well, they better stick to whoever they’ve got in
chicago.’ revolted by his harshness he made amends to nicole,
remembering that nothing had ever felt so young as
her lips, remembering rain like tears shed for him that lay
upon her softly shining porcelain cheeks ... the silence of the
storm ceasing woke him about three o’clock and he went to
the window. her beauty climbed the rolling slope, it came
into the room, rustling ghostlike through the curtains... .
... he climbed two thousand meters to rochers de naye
the following morning, amused by the fact that his conductor
of the day before was using his day off to climb also.
then dick descended all the way to montreux for a
swim, got back to his hotel in time for dinner. two notes
awaited him.
‘i’m not ashamed about last night—it was the nicest thing
that ever happened to me and even if i never saw you again,
mon capitaine, i would be glad it happened.’
that was disarming enough—the heavy shade of dohmler
retreated as dick opened the second envelope:
dear doctor diver: i phoned but you were out. i
wonder if i may ask you a great big favor. unforeseen circumstances
call me back to paris, and i find i can make
better time by way of lausanne. can you let nicole ride as
far as zurich with you, since you are going back monday?
and drop her at the sanitarium? is this too much to ask?

sincerely,
beth evan warren.
dick was furious—miss warren had known he had a bicycle
with him; yet she had so phrased her note that it was
impossible to refuse. throw us together! sweet propinquity
and the warren money!
he was wrong; baby warren had no such intentions. she
had looked dick over with worldly eyes, she had measured
him with the warped rule of an anglophile and found him
wanting—in spite of the fact that she found him toothsome.
but for her he was too ‘intellectual’ and she pigeonholed
him with a shabby-snobby crowd she had once known in
london—he put himself out too much to be really of the
correct stuff. she could not see how he could be made into
her idea of an aristocrat.
in addition to that he was stubborn—she had seen him
leave her conversation and get down behind his eyes in that
odd way that people did, half a dozen times. she had not
liked nicole’s free and easy manner as a child and now she
was sensibly habituated to thinking of her as a ‘gone coon”;
and anyhow doctor diver was not the sort of medical man
she could envisage in the family.
she only wanted to use him innocently as a convenience.
but her request had the effect that dick assumed she desired.
a ride in a train can be a terrible, heavy-hearted or
comic thing; it can be a trial flight; it can be a prefiguration
of another journey just as a given day with a friend can be
long, from the taste of hurry in the morning up to the re-
232 tender is the night
alization of both being hungry and taking food together.
then comes the afternoon with the journey fading and dying,
but quickening again at the end. dick was sad to see
nicole’s meagre joy; yet it was a relief for her, going back to
the only home she knew. they made no love that day, but
when he left her outside the sad door on the zurichsee and
she turned and looked at him he knew her problem was one
they had together for good now.

in zurich in september doctor diver had tea with baby
warren.
‘i think it’s ill advised,’ she said, ‘i’m not sure i truly understand
your motives.’
‘don’t let’s be unpleasant.’
‘after all i’m nicole’s sister.’
‘that doesn’t give you the right to be unpleasant.’ it irritated
dick that he knew so much that he could not tell her.
‘nicole’s rich, but that doesn’t make me an adventurer.’
‘that’s just it,’ complained baby stubbornly. ‘nicole’s
rich.’
‘just how much money has she got?’ he asked.
she started; and with a silent laugh he continued, ‘you
see how silly this is? i’d rather talk to some man in your
family—‘
‘everything’s been left to me,’ she persisted. ‘it isn’t we
think you’re an adventurer. we don’t know who you are.’
‘i’m a doctor of medicine,’ he said. ‘my father is a clergyman,
now retired. we lived in buffalo and my past is open
to investigation. i went to new haven; afterward i was a
rhodes scholar. my great-grandfather was governor of
north carolina and i’m a direct descendant of mad anthony
wayne.’
‘who was mad anthony wayne?’ baby asked suspi-
234 tender is the night
ciously.
‘mad anthony wayne?’
‘i think there’s enough madness in this affair.’
he shook his head hopelessly, just as nicole came out on
the hotel terrace and looked around for them.
‘he was too mad to leave as much money as marshall
field,’ he said.
‘that’s all very well—‘
baby was right and she knew it. face to face, her father
would have it on almost any clergyman. they were an
american ducal family without a title—the very name written
in a hotel register, signed to an introduction, used in
a difficult situation, caused a psychological metamorphosis
in people, and in return this change had crystallized her
own sense of position. she knew these facts from the english,
who had known them for over two hundred years. but
she did not know that twice dick had come close to flinging
the marriage in her face. all that saved it this time was nicole
finding their table and glowing away, white and fresh
and new in the september afternoon.
how do you do, lawyer. we’re going to como tomorrow
for a week and then back to zurich. that’s why i wanted you
and sister to settle this, because it doesn’t matter to us how
much i’m allowed. we’re going to live very quietly in zurich
for two years and dick has enough to take care of us.
no, baby, i’m more practical than you think—it’s only for
clothes and things i’ll need it... . why, that’s more than—can
the estate really afford to give me all that? i know i’ll never
manage to spend it. do you have that much? why do you 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 235
have more—is it because i’m supposed to be incompetent?
all right, let my share pile up then... . no, dick refuses to
have anything whatever to do with it. i’ll have to feel bloated
for us both... . baby, you have no more idea of what dick is
like than, than—now where do i sign? oh, i’m sorry.
... isn’t it funny and lonely being together, dick. no place
to go except close. shall we just love and love? ah, but i love
the most, and i can tell when you’re away from me, even a
little. i think it’s wonderful to be just like everybody else, to
reach out and find you all warm beside me in the bed.
... if you will kindly call my husband at the hospital. yes,
the little book is selling everywhere—they want it published
in six languages. i was to do the french translation but i’m
tired these days—i’m afraid of falling, i’m so heavy and
clumsy—like a broken roly-poly that can’t stand up straight.
the cold stethoscope against my heart and my strongest
feeling ‘je m’en fiche de tout.’— oh, that poor woman in the
hospital with the blue baby, much better dead. isn’t it fine
there are three of us now?
... that seems unreasonable, dick—we have every reason
for taking the bigger apartment. why should we penalize
ourselves just because there’s more warren money than
diver money. oh, thank you, cameriere, but we’ve changed
our minds. this english clergyman tells us that your wine
here in orvieto is excellent. it doesn’t travel? that must be
why we have never heard of it, because we love wine.
the lakes are sunk in the brown clay and the slopes have

... this ship is nice, with our heels hitting the deck together.
this is the blowy corner and each time we turn it i
slant forward against the wind and pull my coat together
without losing step with dick. we are chanting nonsense:
“oh—oh—oh—oh
other flamingoes than me,
oh—oh—oh—oh
other flamingoes than me—‘
life is fun with dick—the people in deck chairs look at
us, and a woman is trying to hear what we are singing. dick
is tired of singing it, so go on alone, dick. you will walk differently
alone, dear, through a thicker atmosphere, forcing
your way through the shadows of chairs, through the dripping
smoke of the funnels. you will feel your own reflection
sliding along the eyes of those who look at you. you are no
longer insulated; but i suppose you must touch life in order
to spring from it.

... we travelled a lot that year—from woolloomooloo bay
to biskra. on the edge of the sahara we ran into a plague of
locusts and the chauffeur explained kindly that they were
bumble-bees. the sky was low at night, full of the presence
of a strange and watchful god. oh, the poor little naked
ouled naïl; the night was noisy with drums from senegal
and flutes and whining camels, and the natives pattering
about in shoes made of old automobile tires.
but i was gone again by that time—trains and beaches
they were all one. that was why he took me travelling but
after my second child, my little girl, topsy, was born everything
got dark again.
... if i could get word to my husband who has seen fit to
desert me here, to leave me in the hands of incompetents.
you tell me my baby is black—that’s farcical, that’s very
cheap. we went to africa merely to see timgad, since my
principal interest in life is archeology. i am tired of knowing
nothing and being reminded of it all the time.
... when i get well i want to be a fine person like you,
dick—i would study medicine except it’s too late. we must
spend my money and have a house—i’m tired of apartments
and waiting for you. you’re bored with zurich and you can’t
find time for writing here and you say that it’s a confession
of weakness for a scientist not to write. and i’ll look over
the whole field of knowledge and pick out something and
really know about it, so i’ll have it to hang on to if i go to
pieces again. you’ll help me, dick, so i won’t feel so guilty.
we’ll live near a warm beach where we can be brown and 
238 tender is the night
young together.
... this is going to be dick’s work house. oh, the idea
came to us both at the same moment. we had passed
tarmes a dozen times and we rode up here and found the
houses empty, except two stables. when we bought we acted
through a frenchman but the navy sent spies up here in no
time when they found that americans had bought part of a
hill village. they looked for cannons all through the building
material, and finally baby had to twitch wires for us at
the affaires etrangères in paris.
no one comes to the riviera in summer, so we expect
to have a few guests and to work. there are some french
people here—mistinguet last week, surprised to find the
hotel open, and picasso and the man who wrote pas sur la
bouche.
... dick, why did you register mr. and mrs. diver instead
of doctor and mrs. diver? i just wondered—it just
floated through my mind.—you’ve taught me that work is
everything and i believe you. you used to say a man knows
things and when he stops knowing things he’s like anybody
else, and the thing is to get power before he stops knowing
things. if you want to turn things topsy-turvy, all right,
but must your nicole follow you walking on her hands, darling?
... tommy says i am silent. since i was well the first time
i talked a lot to dick late at night, both of us sitting up in
bed and lighting cigarettes, then diving down afterward out
of the blue dawn and into the pillows, to keep the light from
our eyes. sometimes i sing, and play with the animals, and

so that he and dick have begun to disapprove of each other.

doctor richard diver and mrs. elsie speers sat in the
café des alliées in august, under cool and dusty trees. the
sparkle of the mica was dulled by the baked ground, and a
few gusts of mistral from down the coast seeped through the
esterel and rocked the fishing boats in the harbor, pointing
the masts here and there at a featureless sky.
‘i had a letter this morning,’ said mrs. speers. ‘what a
terrible time you all must have had with those negroes! but
rosemary said you were perfectly wonderful to her.’
‘rosemary ought to have a service stripe. it was pretty
harrowing— the only person it didn’t disturb was abe
north—he flew off to havre—he probably doesn’t know
about it yet.’
‘i’m sorry mrs. diver was upset,’ she said carefully.
rosemary had written:
nicole seemed out of her mind. i didn’t want to come
south with them because i felt dick had enough on his
hands.
‘she’s all right now.’ he spoke almost impatiently. ‘so
you’re leaving to-morrow. when will you sail?’
‘right away.’
‘my god, it’s awful to have you go.’
‘we’re glad we came here. we’ve had a good time, thanks
to you. you’re the first man rosemary ever cared for.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 241
another gust of wind strained around the porphyry hills
of la napoule. there was a hint in the air that the earth was
hurrying on toward other weather; the lush midsummer
moment outside of time was already over.
‘rosemary’s had crushes but sooner or later she always
turned the man over to me—‘ mrs. speers laughed, ‘—for
dissection.’
‘so i was spared.’
‘there was nothing i could have done. she was in love
with you before i ever saw you. i told her to go ahead.’
he saw that no provision had been made for him, or for
nicole, in mrs. speers’ plans—and he saw that her amorality
sprang from the conditions of her own withdrawal. it was
her right, the pension on which her own emotions had retired.
women are necessarily capable of almost anything in
their struggle for survival and can scarcely be convicted of
such man-made crimes as ‘cruelty.’ so long as the shuffle of
love and pain went on within proper walls mrs. speers could
view it with as much detachment and humor as a eunuch.
she had not even allowed for the possibility of rosemary’s
being damaged—or was she certain that she couldn’t be?
‘if what you say is true i don’t think it did her any harm.’
he was keeping up to the end the pretense that he could
still think objectively about rosemary. ‘she’s over it already.
still—so many of the important times in life begin by seeming
incidental.’
‘this wasn’t incidental,’ mrs. speers insisted. ‘you were
the first man—you’re an ideal to her. in every letter she says
that.’
242 tender is the night
‘she’s so polite.’
‘you and rosemary are the politest people i’ve ever
known, but she means this.’
‘my politeness is a trick of the heart.’
this was partly true. from his father dick had learned
the somewhat conscious good manners of the young southerner
coming north after the civil war. often he used them
and just as often he despised them because they were not a
protest against how unpleasant selfishness was but against
how unpleasant it looked.
‘i’m in love with rosemary,’ he told her suddenly. ‘it’s a
kind of self-indulgence saying that to you.’
it seemed very strange and official to him, as if the very
tables and chairs in the café des alliées would remember
it forever. already he felt her absence from these skies: on
the beach he could only remember the sun-torn flesh of
her shoulder; at tarmes he crushed out her footprints as he
crossed the garden; and now the orchestra launching into
the nice carnival song, an echo of last year’s vanished gaieties,
started the little dance that went on all about her. in
a hundred hours she had come to possess all the world’s
dark magic; the blinding belladonna, the caffein converting
physical into nervous energy, the mandragora that imposes
harmony.
with an effort he once more accepted the fiction that he
shared mrs. speers’ detachment.
‘you and rosemary aren’t really alike,’ he said. ‘the wisdom
she got from you is all molded up into her persona,
into the mask she faces the world with. she doesn’t think; 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 243
her real depths are irish and romantic and illogical.’
mrs. speers knew too that rosemary, for all her delicate
surface, was a young mustang, perceptibly by captain doctor
hoyt, u.s.a. cross-sectioned, rosemary would have
displayed an enormous heart, liver and soul, all crammed
close together under the lovely shell.
saying good-by, dick was aware of elsie speers’ full
charm, aware that she meant rather more to him than merely
a last unwillingly relinquished fragment of rosemary. he
could possibly have made up rosemary—he could never
have made up her mother. if the cloak, spurs and brilliants
in which rosemary had walked off were things with which
he had endowed her, it was nice in contrast to watch her
mother’s grace knowing it was surely something he had not
evoked. she had an air of seeming to wait, as if for a man
to get through with something more important than herself,
a battle or an operation, during which he must not be
hurried or interfered with. when the man had finished she
would be waiting, without fret or impatience, somewhere
on a highstool, turning the pages of a newspaper.
‘good-by—and i want you both to remember always
how fond of you nicole and i have grown.’
back at the villa diana, he went to his work-room, and
opened the shutters, closed against the mid-day glare. on
his two long tables, in ordered confusion, lay the materials
of his book. volume i, concerned with classification,
had achieved some success in a small subsidized edition. he
was negotiating for its reissue. volume ii was to be a great
amplification of his first little book, a psychology for psy-
244 tender is the night
chiatrists. like so many men he had found that he had only
one or two ideas—that his little collection of pamphlets now
in its fiftieth german edition contained the germ of all he
would ever think or know.
but he was currently uneasy about the whole thing. he
resented the wasted years at new haven, but mostly he felt a
discrepancy between the growing luxury in which the divers
lived, and the need for display which apparently went
along with it. remembering his rumanian friend’s story,
about the man who had worked for years on the brain of an
armadillo, he suspected that patient germans were sitting
close to the libraries of berlin and vienna callously anticipating
him. he had about decided to brief the work in its
present condition and publish it in an undocumented volume
of a hundred thousand words as an introduction to
more scholarly volumes to follow.
he confirmed this decision walking around the rays
of late afternoon in his work-room. with the new plan he
could be through by spring. it seemed to him that when a
man with his energy was pursued for a year by increasing
doubts, it indicated some fault in the plan.
he laid the bars of gilded metal that he used as paperweights
along the sheaves of notes. he swept up, for no
servant was allowed in here, treated his washroom sketchily
with bon ami, repaired a screen and sent off an order to a
publishing house in zurich. then he drank an ounce of gin
with twice as much water.
he saw nicole in the garden. presently he must encounter
her and the prospect gave him a leaden feeling. before her 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 245
he must keep up a perfect front, now and to-morrow, next
week and next year. all night in paris he had held her in
his arms while she slept light under the luminol; in the early
morning he broke in upon her confusion before it could
form, with words of tenderness and protection, and she
slept again with his face against the warm scent of her hair.
before she woke he had arranged everything at the phone in
the next room. rosemary was to move to another hotel. she
was to be ‘daddy’s girl’ and even to give up saying good-by
to them. the proprietor of the hotel, mr. mcbeth, was to be
the three chinese monkeys. packing amid the piled boxes
and tissue paper of many purchases, dick and nicole left for
the riviera at noon.
then there was a reaction. as they settled down in the
wagon-lit dick saw that nicole was waiting for it, and it
came quickly and desperately, before the train was out of
the ceinture—his only instinct was to step off while the
train was still going slow, rush back and see where rosemary
was, what she was doing. he opened a book and bent
his pince-nez upon it, aware that nicole was watching him
from her pillow across the compartment. unable to read,
he pretended to be tired and shut his eyes but she was still
watching him, and though still she was half asleep from the
hangover of the drug, she was relieved and almost happy
that he was hers again.
it was worse with his eyes shut for it gave a rhythm of
finding and losing, finding and losing; but so as not to appear
restless he lay like that until noon. at luncheon things
were better—it was always a fine meal; a thousand lunches 
246 tender is the night
in inns and restaurants, wagon-lits, buffets, and aeroplanes
were a mighty collation to have taken together. the familiar
hurry of the train waiters, the little bottles of wine and
mineral water, the excellent food of the paris-lyons-méditerranee
gave them the illusion that everything was the
same as before, but it was almost the first trip he had ever
taken with nicole that was a going away rather than a going
toward. he drank a whole bottle of wine save for nicole’s
single glass; they talked about the house and the children.
but once back in the compartment a silence fell over them
like the silence in the restaurant across from the luxembourg.
receding from a grief, it seems necessary to retrace
the same steps that brought us there. an unfamiliar impatience
settled on dick; suddenly nicole said:
‘it seemed too bad to leave rosemary like that—do you
suppose she’ll be all right?’
‘of course. she could take care of herself anywhere—‘
lest this belittle nicole’s ability to do likewise, he added,
‘after all, she’s an actress, and even though her mother’s in
the background she has to look out for herself.’
‘she’s very attractive.’
‘she’s an infant.’
‘she’s attractive though.’
they talked aimlessly back and forth, each speaking for
the other.
‘she’s not as intelligent as i thought,’ dick offered.
‘she’s quite smart.’
‘not very, though—there’s a persistent aroma of the
nursery.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 247
‘she’s very—very pretty,’ nicole said in a detached,
emphatic way, ‘and i thought she was very good in the picture.’
‘she was well directed. thinking it over, it wasn’t very
individual.’
‘i thought it was. i can see how she’d be very attractive
to men.’
his heart twisted. to what men? how many men?
—do you mind if i pull down the curtain?
—please do, it’s too light in here.
where now? and with whom?
‘in a few years she’ll look ten years older than you.’
‘on the contrary. i sketched her one night on a theatre
program, i think she’ll last.’
they were both restless in the night. in a day or two dick
would try to banish the ghost of rosemary before it became
walled up with them, but for the moment he had no force to
do it. sometimes it is harder to deprive oneself of a pain than
of a pleasure and the memory so possessed him that for the
moment there was nothing to do but to pretend. this was
more difficult because he was currently annoyed with nicole,
who, after all these years, should recognize symptoms
of strain in herself and guard against them. twice within
a fortnight she had broken up: there had been the night of
the dinner at tarmes when he had found her in her bedroom
dissolved in crazy laughter telling mrs. mckisco she
could not go in the bathroom because the key was thrown
down the well. mrs. mckisco was astonished and resentful,
baffled and yet in a way comprehending. dick had not 
248 tender is the night
been particularly alarmed then, for afterward nicole was
repentant. she called at gausse’s hotel but the mckiscos
were gone.
the collapse in paris was another matter, adding significance
to the first one. it prophesied possibly a new cycle,
a new pousse of the malady. having gone through unprofessional
agonies during her long relapse following topsy’s
birth, he had, perforce, hardened himself about her, making
a cleavage between nicole sick and nicole well. this made it
difficult now to distinguish between his selfprotective professional
detachment and some new coldness in his heart.
as an indifference cherished, or left to atrophy, becomes an
emptiness, to this extent he had learned to become empty
of nicole, serving her against his will with negations and
emotional neglect. one writes of scars healed, a loose parallel
to the pathology of the skin, but there is no such thing
in the life of an individual. there are open wounds, shrunk
sometimes to the size of a pin-prick but wounds still. the
marks of suffering are more comparable to the loss of a finger,
or of the sight of an eye. we may not miss them, either,
for one minute in a year, but if we should there is nothing to
be done about it.

he found nicole in the garden with her arms folded high
on her shoulders. she looked at him with straight gray eyes,
with a child’s searching wonder.
‘i went to cannes,’ he said. ‘i ran into mrs. speers. she’s
leaving to-morrow. she wanted to come up and say good-by
to you, but i slew the idea.’
‘i’m sorry. i’d like to have seen her. i like her.’
‘who else do you think i saw—bartholomew tailor.’
‘you didn’t.’
‘i couldn’t have missed that face of his, the old experienced
weasel. he was looking over the ground for ciro’s
menagerie— they’ll all be down next year. i suspected mrs.
abrams was a sort of outpost.’
‘and baby was outraged the first summer we came
here.’
‘they don’t really give a damn where they are, so i don’t
see why they don’t stay and freeze in deauville.’
‘can’t we start rumors about cholera or something?’
‘i told bartholomew that some categories died off like
flies here— i told him the life of a suck was as short as the
life of a machine-gunner in the war.’
‘you didn’t.’
‘no, i didn’t,’ he admitted. ‘he was very pleasant. it
was a beautiful sight, he and i shaking hands there on the 
250 tender is the night
boulevard. the meeting of sigmund freud and ward mcallister.’
dick didn’t want to talk—he wanted to be alone so that
his thoughts about work and the future would overpower
his thoughts of love and to-day. nicole knew about it but
only darkly and tragically, hating him a little in an animal
way, yet wanting to rub against his shoulder.
‘the darling,’ dick said lightly.
he went into the house, forgetting something he wanted
to do there, and then remembering it was the piano. he sat
down whistling and played by ear:
“just picture you upon my knee
with tea for two and two for tea
and me for you and you for me—‘
through the melody flowed a sudden realization that nicole,
hearing it, would guess quickly at a nostalgia for the
past fortnight. he broke off with a casual chord and left the
piano.
it was hard to know where to go. he glanced about the
house that nicole had made, that nicole’s grandfather had
paid for. he owned only his work house and the ground
on which it stood. out of three thousand a year and what
dribbled in from his publications he paid for his clothes and
personal expenses, for cellar charges, and for lanier’s education,
so far confined to a nurse’s wage. never had a move
been contemplated without dick’s figuring his share. living
rather ascetically, travelling third-class when he was alone, 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 251
with the cheapest wine, and good care of his clothes, and
penalizing himself for any extravagances, he maintained
a qualified financial independence. after a certain point,
though, it was difficult— again and again it was necessary
to decide together as to the uses to which nicole’s money
should be put. naturally nicole, wanting to own him, wanting
him to stand still forever, encouraged any slackness on
his part, and in multiplying ways he was constantly inundated
by a trickling of goods and money. the inception of
the idea of the cliff villa which they had elaborated as a fantasy
one day was a typical example of the forces divorcing
them from the first simple arrangements in zurich.
‘wouldn’t it be fun if—‘ it had been; and then, ‘won’t it
be fun when—‘
it was not so much fun. his work became confused with
nicole’s problems; in addition, her income had increased so
fast of late that it seemed to belittle his work. also, for the
purpose of her cure, he had for many years pretended to a
rigid domesticity from which he was drifting away, and this
pretense became more arduous in this effortless immobility,
in which he was inevitably subjected to microscopic examination.
when dick could no longer play what he wanted to
play on the piano, it was an indication that life was being refined
down to a point. he stayed in the big room a long time
listening to the buzz of the electric clock, listening to time.
in november the waves grew black and dashed over the
sea wall onto the shore road—such summer life as had survived
disappeared and the beaches were melancholy and
desolate under the mistral and rain. gausse’s hotel was 
252 tender is the night
closed for repairs and enlargement and the scaffolding of
the summer casino at juan les pins grew larger and more
formidable. going into cannes or nice, dick and nicole met
new people—members of orchestras, restaurateurs, horticultural
enthusiasts, shipbuilders—for dick had bought an
old dinghy—and members of the syndicat d’initiative. they
knew their servants well and gave thought to the children’s
education. in december, nicole seemed well-knit again;
when a month had passed without tension, without the tight
mouth, the unmotivated smile, the unfathomable remark,
they went to the swiss alps for the christmas holidays.

with his cap, dick slapped the snow from his dark blue
ski-suit before going inside. the great hall, its floor pockmarked
by two decades of hobnails, was cleared for the
tea dance, and four-score young americans, domiciled in
schools near gstaad, bounced about to the frolic of ‘don’t
bring lulu,’ or exploded violently with the first percussions
of the charleston. it was a colony of the young, simple, and
expensive—the sturmtruppen of the rich were at st. moritz.
baby warren felt that she had made a gesture of renunciation
in joining the divers here.
dick picked out the two sisters easily across the delicately
haunted, soft-swaying room—they were poster-like,
formidable in their snow costumes, nicole’s of cerulean
blue, baby’s of brick red. the young englishman was talking
to them; but they were paying no attention, lulled to the
staring point by the adolescent dance.
nicole’s snow-warm face lighted up further as she saw
dick. ‘where is he?’
‘he missed the train—i’m meeting him later.’ dick sat
down, swinging a heavy boot over his knee. ‘you two look
very striking together. every once in a while i forget we’re in
the same party and get a big shock at seeing you.’
baby was a tall, fine-looking woman, deeply engaged in
being almost thirty. symptomatically she had pulled two 
254 tender is the night
men with her from london, one scarcely down from cambridge,
one old and hard with victorian lecheries. baby
had certain spinsters’ characteristics— she was alien from
touch, she started if she was touched suddenly, and such
lingering touches as kisses and embraces slipped directly
through the flesh into the forefront of her consciousness.
she made few gestures with her trunk, her body proper—
instead, she stamped her foot and tossed her head in almost
an old-fashioned way. she relished the foretaste of death,
prefigured by the catastrophes of friends—persistently she
clung to the idea of nicole’s tragic destiny.
baby’s younger englishman had been chaperoning the
women down appropriate inclines and harrowing them on
the bob-run. dick, having turned an ankle in a too ambitious
telemark, loafed gratefully about the ‘nursery slope’
with the children or drank kvass with a russian doctor at
the hotel.
‘please be happy, dick,’ nicole urged him. ‘why don’t
you meet some of these ickle durls and dance with them in
the afternoon?’
‘what would i say to them?’
her low almost harsh voice rose a few notes, simulating a
plaintive coquetry: ‘say: ‘ickle durl, oo is de pwettiest sing.’
what do you think you say?’
‘i don’t like ickle durls. they smell of castile soap and
peppermint. when i dance with them, i feel as if i’m pushing
a baby carriage.’
it was a dangerous subject—he was careful, to the point
of selfconsciousness, to stare far over the heads of young 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 255
maidens.
‘there’s a lot of business,’ said baby. ‘first place, there’s
news from home—the property we used to call the station
property. the railroads only bought the centre of it at first.
now they’ve bought the rest, and it belonged to mother. it’s
a question of investing the money.’
pretending to be repelled by this gross turn in the conversation,
the englishman made for a girl on the floor.
following him for an instant with the uncertain eyes of an
american girl in the grip of a life-long anglophilia, baby
continued defiantly:
‘it’s a lot of money. it’s three hundred thousand apiece.
i keep an eye on my own investments but nicole doesn’t
know anything about securities, and i don’t suppose you do
either.’
‘i’ve got to meet the train,’ dick said evasively.
outside he inhaled damp snowflakes that he could no
longer see against the darkening sky. three children sledding
past shouted a warning in some strange language; he
heard them yell at the next bend and a little farther on he
heard sleigh-bells coming up the hill in the dark. the holiday
station glittered with expectancy, boys and girls waiting for
new boys and girls, and by the time the train arrived, dick
had caught the rhythm, and pretended to franz gregorovius
that he was clipping off a half-hour from an endless roll
of pleasures. but franz had some intensity of purpose at the
moment that fought through any superimposition of mood
on dick’s part. ‘i may get up to zurich for a day,’ dick had
written, ‘or you can manage to come to lausanne.’ franz 
256 tender is the night
had managed to come all the way to gstaad.
he was forty. upon his healthy maturity reposed a set
of pleasant official manners, but he was most at home in
a somewhat stuffy safety from which he could despise the
broken rich whom he reeducated. his scientific heredity
might have bequeathed him a wider world but he seemed
to have deliberately chosen the standpoint of an humbler
class, a choice typified by his selection of a wife. at the hotel
baby warren made a quick examination of him, and failing
to find any of the hall-marks she respected, the subtler
virtues or courtesies by which the privileged classes recognized
one another, treated him thereafter with her second
manner. nicole was always a little afraid of him. dick liked
him, as he liked his friends, without reservations.
for the evening they were sliding down the hill into the
village, on those little sleds which serve the same purpose
as gondolas do in venice. their destination was a hotel with
an old-fashioned swiss tap-room, wooden and resounding,
a room of clocks, kegs, steins, and antlers. many parties at
long tables blurred into one great party and ate fondue—a
peculiarly indigestible form of welsh rarebit, mitigated by
hot spiced wine.
it was jolly in the big room; the younger englishman remarked
it and dick conceded that there was no other word.
with the pert heady wine he relaxed and pretended that the
world was all put together again by the gray-haired men of
the golden nineties who shouted old glees at the piano, by
the young voices and the bright costumes toned into the
room by the swirling smoke. for a moment he felt that they 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 257
were in a ship with landfall just ahead; in the faces of all the
girls was the same innocent expectation of the possibilities
inherent in the situation and the night. he looked to see if
that special girl was there and got an impression that she
was at the table behind them—then he forgot her and invented
a rigmarole and tried to make his party have a good
time.
‘i must talk to you,’ said franz in english. ‘i have only
twentyfour hours to spend here.’
‘i suspected you had something on your mind.’
‘i have a plan that is—so marvellous.’ his hand fell upon
dick’s knee. ‘i have a plan that will be the making of us
two.’
‘well?’
‘dick—there is a clinic we could have together—the old
clinic of braun on the zugersee. the plant is all modern
except for a few points. he is sick—he wants to go up in
austria, to die probably. it is a chance that is just insuperable.
you and me—what a pair! now don’t say anything yet
until i finish.’
from the yellow glint in baby’s eyes, dick saw she was
listening.
‘we must undertake it together. it would not bind you
too tight— it would give you a base, a laboratory, a centre.
you could stay in residence say no more than half the year,
when the weather is fine. in winter you could go to france
or america and write your texts fresh from clinical experience.’
he lowered his voice. ‘and for the convalescence
in your family, there are the atmosphere and regularity of 
258 tender is the night
the clinic at hand.’ dick’s expression did not encourage this
note so franz dropped it with the punctuation of his tongue
leaving his lip quickly. ‘we could be partners. i the executive
manager, you the theoretician, the brilliant consultant
and all that. i know myself—i know i have no genius and
you have. but, in my way, i am thought very capable; i am
utterly competent at the most modern clinical methods.
sometimes for months i have served as the practical head
of the old clinic. the professor says this plan is excellent, he
advises me to go ahead. he says he is going to live forever,
and work up to the last minute.’
dick formed imaginary pictures of the prospect as a preliminary
to any exercise of judgment.
‘what’s the financial angle?’ he asked.
franz threw up his chin, his eyebrows, the transient
wrinkles of his forehead, his hands, his elbows, his shoulders;
he strained up the muscles of his legs, so that the cloth
of his trousers bulged, pushed up his heart into his throat
and his voice into the roof of his mouth.
‘there we have it! money!’ he bewailed. ‘i have little
money. the price in american money is two hundred thousand
dollars. the innovation—ary—‘ he tasted the coinage
doubtfully, ‘—steps, that you will agree are necessary, will
cost twenty thousand dollars american. but the clinic is a
gold mine—i tell you, i haven’t seen the books. for an investment
of two hundred and twenty thousand dollars we
have an assured income of—‘
baby’s curiosity was such that dick brought her into the
conversation.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 259
‘in your experience, baby,’ he demanded, ‘have you
found that when a european wants to see an american
very pressingly it is invariably something concerned with
money?’
‘what is it?’ she said innocently.
‘this young privat-dozent thinks that he and i ought to
launch into big business and try to attract nervous breakdowns
from america.’
worried, franz stared at baby as dick continued:
‘but who are we, franz? you bear a big name and i’ve
written two textbooks. is that enough to attract anybody?
and i haven’t got that much money—i haven’t got a tenth
of it.’ franz smiled cynically. ‘honestly i haven’t. nicole and
baby are rich as croesus but i haven’t managed to get my
hands on any of it yet.’
they were all listening now—dick wondered if the girl at
the table behind was listening too. the idea attracted him.
he decided to let baby speak for him, as one often lets women
raise their voices over issues that are not in their hands.
baby became suddenly her grandfather, cool and experimental.
‘i think it’s a suggestion you ought to consider, dick. i
don’t know what doctor gregory was saying—but it seems
to me—‘
behind him the girl had leaned forward into a smoke
ring and was picking up something from the floor. nicole’s
face, fitted into his own across the table—her beauty, tentatively
nesting and posing, flowed into his love, ever braced
to protect it.
260 tender is the night
‘consider it, dick,’ franz urged excitedly. ‘when one
writes on psychiatry, one should have actual clinical contacts.
jung writes, bleuler writes, freud writes, forel writes,
adler writes—also they are in constant contact with mental
disorder.’
‘dick has me,’ laughed nicole. ‘i should think that’d be
enough mental disorder for one man.’
‘that’s different,’ said franz cautiously.
baby was thinking that if nicole lived beside a clinic she
would always feel quite safe about her.
‘we must think it over carefully,’ she said.
though amused at her insolence, dick did not encourage
it.
‘the decision concerns me, baby,’ he said gently. ‘it’s nice
of you to want to buy me a clinic.’
realizing she had meddled, baby withdrew hurriedly:
‘of course, it’s entirely your affair.’
‘a thing as important as this will take weeks to decide. i
wonder how i like the picture of nicole and me anchored to
zurich—‘ he turned to franz, anticipating: ‘—i know. zurich
has a gashouse and running water and electric light—i
lived there three years.’
‘i will leave you to think it over,’ said franz. ‘i am confident—‘
one hundred pair of five-pound boots had begun to
clump toward the door, and they joined the press. outside
in the crisp moonlight, dick saw the girl tying her sled to
one of the sleighs ahead. they piled into their own sleigh
and at the crisp-cracking whips the horses strained, breast-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 261
ing the dark air. past them figures ran and scrambled, the
younger ones shoving each other from sleds and runners,
landing in the soft snow, then panting after the horses to
drop exhausted on a sled or wail that they were abandoned.
on either side the fields were beneficently tranquil; the space
through which the cavalcade moved was high and limitless.
in the country there was less noise as though they were all
listening atavistically for wolves in the wide snow.
in saanen, they poured into the municipal dance,
crowded with cow herders, hotel servants, shop-keepers, ski
teachers, guides, tourists, peasants. to come into the warm
enclosed place after the pantheistic animal feeling without,
was to reassume some absurd and impressive knightly
name, as thunderous as spurred boots in war, as football
cleats on the cement of a locker-room floor. there was conventional
yodelling, and the familiar rhythm of it separated
dick from what he had first found romantic in the scene. at
first he thought it was because he had hounded the girl out
of his consciousness; then it came to him under the form
of what baby had said: ‘we must think it over carefully—‘
and the unsaid lines back of that: ‘we own you, and you’ll
admit it sooner or later. it is absurd to keep up the pretense
of independence.’
it had been years since dick had bottled up malice
against a creature—since freshman year at new haven
when he had come upon a popular essay about ‘mental hygiene.’
now he lost his temper at baby and simultaneously
tried to coop it up within him, resenting her cold rich insolence.
it would be hundreds of years before any emergent 
262 tender is the night
amazons would ever grasp the fact that a man is vulnerable
only in his pride, but delicate as humpty-dumpty once
that is meddled with—though some of them paid the fact a
cautious lipservice. doctor diver’s profession of sorting the
broken shells of another sort of egg had given him a dread
of breakage. but:
‘there’s too much good manners,’ he said on the way
back to gstaad in the smooth sleigh.
‘well, i think that’s nice,’ said baby.
‘no, it isn’t,’ he insisted to the anonymous bundle of fur.
‘good manners are an admission that everybody is so tender
that they have to be handled with gloves. now, human
respect—you don’t call a man a coward or a liar lightly, but
if you spend your life sparing people’s feelings and feeding
their vanity, you get so you can’t distinguish what should
be respected in them.’
‘i think americans take their manners rather seriously,’
said the elder englishman.
‘i guess so,’ said dick. ‘my father had the kind of manners
he inherited from the days when you shot first and
apologized afterward. men armed—why, you europeans
haven’t carried arms in civil life since the beginning of the
eighteenth century—‘
‘not actually, perhaps—‘
‘not act-ually. not really.’
‘dick, you’ve always had such beautiful manners,’ said
baby conciliatingly.
the women were regarding him across the zoo of robes
with some alarm. the younger englishman did not under-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 263
stand—he was one of the kind who were always jumping
around cornices and balconies, as if they thought they were
in the rigging of a ship—and filled the ride to the hotel with
a preposterous story about a boxing match with his best
friend in which they loved and bruised each other for an
hour, always with great reserve. dick became facetious.
‘so every time he hit you you considered him an even
better friend?’
‘i respected him more.’
‘it’s the premise i don’t understand. you and your best
friend scrap about a trivial matter—‘
‘if you don’t understand, i can’t explain it to you,’ said
the young englishman coldly.
—this is what i’ll get if i begin saying what i think, dick
said to himself.
he was ashamed at baiting the man, realizing that the absurdity
of the story rested in the immaturity of the attitude
combined with the sophisticated method of its narration.
the carnival spirit was strong and they went with the
crowd into the grill, where a tunisian barman manipulated
the illumination in a counterpoint, whose other melody
was the moon off the ice rink staring in the big windows. in
that light, dick found the girl devitalized, and uninteresting—he
turned from her to enjoy the darkness, the cigarette
points going green and silver when the lights shone red, the
band of white that fell across the dancers as the door to the
bar was opened and closed.
‘now tell me, franz,’ he demanded, ‘do you think after
sitting up all night drinking beer, you can go back and con-
264 tender is the night
vince your patients that you have any character? don’t you
think they’ll see you’re a gastropath?’
‘i’m going to bed,’ nicole announced. dick accompanied
her to the door of the elevator.
‘i’d come with you but i must show franz that i’m not
intended for a clinician.’
nicole walked into the elevator.
‘baby has lots of common sense,’ she said meditatively.
‘baby is one of—‘
the door slashed shut—facing a mechanical hum, dick
finished the sentence in his mind, ‘—baby is a trivial, selfish
woman.’
but two days later, sleighing to the station with franz,
dick admitted that he thought favorably upon the matter.
‘we’re beginning to turn in a circle,’ he admitted. ‘living
on this scale, there’s an unavoidable series of strains,
and nicole doesn’t survive them. the pastoral quality down
on the summer riviera is all changing anyhow—next year
they’ll have a season.’
they passed the crisp green rinks where wiener waltzes
blared and the colors of many mountain schools flashed
against the pale-blue skies.
‘—i hope we’ll be able to do it, franz. there’s nobody i’d
rather try it with than you—‘
good-by, gstaad! good-by, fresh faces, cold sweet flowers,
flakes in the darkness. good-by, gstaad, good-by!

dick awoke at five after a long dream of war, walked to
the window and stared out it at the zugersee. his dream
had begun in sombre majesty; navy blue uniforms crossed
a dark plaza behind bands playing the second movement of
prokofieff’s ‘love of three oranges.’ presently there were
fire engines, symbols of disaster, and a ghastly uprising of
the mutilated in a dressing station. he turned on his bedlamp
light and made a thorough note of it ending with the
half-ironic phrase: ‘non-combatant’s shell-shock.’
as he sat on the side of his bed, he felt the room, the house
and the night as empty. in the next room nicole muttered
something desolate and he felt sorry for whatever loneliness
she was feeling in her sleep. for him time stood still and
then every few years accelerated in a rush, like the quick rewind
of a film, but for nicole the years slipped away by clock
and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her
perishable beauty.
even this past year and a half on the zugersee seemed
wasted time for her, the seasons marked only by the workmen
on the road turning pink in may, brown in july, black
in september, white again in spring. she had come out of
her first illness alive with new hopes, expecting so much,
yet deprived of any subsistence except dick, bringing up
children she could only pretend gently to love, guided or-
266 tender is the night
phans. the people she liked, rebels mostly, disturbed her
and were bad for her—she sought in them the vitality that
had made them independent or creative or rugged, sought
in vain—for their secrets were buried deep in childhood
struggles they had forgotten. they were more interested in
nicole’s exterior harmony and charm, the other face of her
illness. she led a lonely life owning dick who did not want
to be owned.
many times he had tried unsuccessfully to let go his
hold on her. they had many fine times together, fine talks
between the loves of the white nights, but always when he
turned away from her into himself he left her holding nothing
in her hands and staring at it, calling it many names,
but knowing it was only the hope that he would come back
soon.
he scrunched his pillow hard, lay down, and put the
back of his neck against it as a japanese does to slow the circulation,
and slept again for a time. later, while he shaved,
nicole awoke and marched around, giving abrupt, succinct
orders to children and servants. lanier came in to watch his
father shave—living beside a psychiatric clinic he had developed
an extraordinary confidence in and admiration for
his father, together with an exaggerated indifference toward
most other adults; the patients appeared to him either in
their odd aspects, or else as devitalized, over-correct creatures
without personality. he was a handsome, promising
boy and dick devoted much time to him, in the relationship
of a sympathetic but exacting officer and respectful enlisted
man.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 267
‘why,’ lanier asked, ‘do you always leave a little lather
on the top of your hair when you shave?’
cautiously dick parted soapy lips: ‘i have never been able
to find out. i’ve often wondered. i think it’s because i get the
first finger soapy when i make the line of my side-burn, but
how it gets up on top of my head i don’t know.’
‘i’m going to watch it all to-morrow.’
‘that’s your only question before breakfast?’
‘i don’t really call it a question.’
‘that’s one on you.’
half an hour later dick started up to the administration
building. he was thirty-eight—still declining a beard
he yet had a more medical aura about him than he had
worn upon the riviera. for eighteen months now he had
lived at the clinic—certainly one of the best-appointed in
europe. like dohmler’s it was of the modern type—no
longer a single dark and sinister building but a small, scattered,
yet deceitfully integrated village—dick and nicole
had added much in the domain of taste, so that the plant
was a thing of beauty, visited by every psychologist passing
through zurich. with the addition of a caddy house it
might very well have been a country club. the eglantine
and the beeches, houses for those sunk into eternal darkness,
were screened by little copses from the main building,
camouflaged strong-points. behind was a large truck farm,
worked partly by the patients. the workshops for ergotherapy
were three, placed under a single roof and there doctor
diver began his morning’s inspection. the carpentry shop,
full of sunlight, exuded the sweetness of sawdust, of a lost 
268 tender is the night
age of wood; always half a dozen men were there, hammering,
planing, buzzing— silent men, who lifted solemn eyes
from their work as he passed through. himself a good carpenter,
he discussed with them the efficiency of some tools
for a moment in a quiet, personal, interested voice. adjoining
was the book-bindery, adapted to the most mobile of
patients who were not always, however, those who had the
greatest chance for recovery. the last chamber was devoted
to beadwork, weaving and work in brass. the faces of
the patients here wore the expression of one who had just
sighed profoundly, dismissing something insoluble—but
their sighs only marked the beginning of another ceaseless
round of ratiocination, not in a line as with normal people
but in the same circle. round, round, and round. around
forever. but the bright colors of the stuffs they worked with
gave strangers a momentary illusion that all was well, as in
a kindergarten. these patients brightened as doctor diver
came in. most of them liked him better than they liked
doctor gregorovius. those who had once lived in the great
world invariably liked him better. there were a few who
thought he neglected them, or that he was not simple, or
that he posed. their responses were not dissimilar to those
that dick evoked in nonprofessional life, but here they were
warped and distorted.
one englishwoman spoke to him always about a subject
which she considered her own.
‘have we got music to-night?’
‘i don’t know,’ he answered. ‘i haven’t seen doctor ladislau.
how did you enjoy the music that mrs. sachs and mr. 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 269
longstreet gave us last night?’
‘it was so-so.’
‘i thought it was fine—especially the chopin.’
‘i thought it was so-so.’
‘when are you going to play for us yourself?’
she shrugged her shoulders, as pleased at this question as
she had been for several years.
‘some time. but i only play so-so.’
they knew that she did not play at all—she had had two
sisters who were brilliant musicians, but she had never been
able to learn the notes when they had been young together.
from the workshop dick went to visit the eglantine
and the beeches. exteriorly these houses were as cheerful
as the others; nicole had designed the decoration and the
furniture on a necessary base of concealed grills and bars
and immovable furniture. she had worked with so much
imagination—the inventive quality, which she lacked, being
supplied by the problem itself—that no instructed visitor
would have dreamed that the light, graceful filagree work at
a window was a strong, unyielding end of a tether, that the
pieces reflecting modern tubular tendencies were stancher
than the massive creations of the edwardians—even the
flowers lay in iron fingers and every casual ornament and
fixture was as necessary as a girder in a skyscraper. her
tireless eyes had made each room yield up its greatest usefulness.
complimented, she referred to herself brusquely as
a master plumber.
for those whose compasses were not depolarized there
seemed many odd things in these houses. doctor diver was 
270 tender is the night
often amused in the eglantine, the men’s building—here
there was a strange little exhibitionist who thought that if
he could walk unclothed and unmolested from the êtoile to
the place de la concorde he would solve many things—and,
perhaps, dick thought, he was quite right.
his most interesting case was in the main building. the
patient was a woman of thirty who had been in the clinic
six months; she was an american painter who had lived
long in paris. they had no very satisfactory history of her.
a cousin had happened upon her all mad and gone and after
an unsatisfactory interlude at one of the whoopee cures
that fringed the city, dedicated largely to tourist victims of
drug and drink, he had managed to get her to switzerland.
on her admittance she had been exceptionally pretty— now
she was a living agonizing sore. all blood tests had failed
to give a positive reaction and the trouble was unsatisfactorily
catalogued as nervous eczema. for two months she
had lain under it, as imprisoned as in the iron maiden. she
was coherent, even brilliant, within the limits of her special
hallucinations.
she was particularly his patient. during spells of overexcitement
he was the only doctor who could ‘do anything
with her.’ several weeks ago, on one of many nights that
she had passed in sleepless torture franz had succeeded in
hypnotizing her into a few hours of needed rest, but he had
never again succeeded. hypnosis was a tool that dick had
distrusted and seldom used, for he knew that he could not
always summon up the mood in himself—he had once tried
it on nicole and she had scornfully laughed at him.

the woman in room twenty could not see him when he
came in—the area about her eyes was too tightly swollen.
she spoke in a strong, rich, deep, thrilling voice.
‘how long will this last? is it going to be forever?’
‘it’s not going to be very long now. doctor ladislau tells
me there are whole areas cleared up.’
‘if i knew what i had done to deserve this i could accept
it with equanimity.’
‘it isn’t wise to be mystical about it—we recognize it as a
nervous phenomenon. it’s related to the blush—when you
were a girl, did you blush easily?’
she lay with her face turned to the ceiling.
‘i have found nothing to blush for since i cut my wisdom
teeth.’
‘haven’t you committed your share of petty sins and
mistakes?’
‘i have nothing to reproach myself with.’
‘you’re very fortunate.’
the woman thought a moment; her voice came up
through her bandaged face afflicted with subterranean melodies:
‘i’m sharing the fate of the women of my time who challenged
men to battle.’
‘to your vast surprise it was just like all battles,’ he answered,
adopting her formal diction.
‘just like all battles.’ she thought this over. ‘you pick a
setup, or else win a pyrrhic victory, or you’re wrecked and
ruined— you’re a ghostly echo from a broken wall.’
‘you are neither wrecked nor ruined,’ he told her. ‘are 
272 tender is the night
you quite sure you’ve been in a real battle?’
‘look at me!’ she cried furiously.
‘you’ve suffered, but many women suffered before they
mistook themselves for men.’ it was becoming an argument
and he retreated. ‘in any case you mustn’t confuse a single
failure with a final defeat.’
she sneered. ‘beautiful words,’ and the phrase transpiring
up through the crust of pain humbled him.
‘we would like to go into the true reasons that brought
you here—‘ he began but she interrupted.
‘i am here as a symbol of something. i thought perhaps
you would know what it was.’
‘you are sick,’ he said mechanically.
‘then what was it i had almost found?’
‘a greater sickness.’
‘that’s all?’
‘that’s all.’ with disgust he heard himself lying, but here
and now the vastness of the subject could only be compressed
into a lie. ‘outside of that there’s only confusion and
chaos. i won’t lecture to you—we have too acute a realization
of your physical suffering. but it’s only by meeting the problems
of every day, no matter how trifling and boring they
seem, that you can make things drop back into place again.
after that—perhaps you’ll be able again to examine—‘
he had slowed up to avoid the inevitable end of his
thought: ‘—the frontiers of consciousness.’ the frontiers
that artists must explore were not for her, ever. she was finespun,
inbred— eventually she might find rest in some quiet
mysticism. exploration was for those with a measure of 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 273
peasant blood, those with big thighs and thick ankles who
could take punishment as they took bread and salt, on every
inch of flesh and spirit.
—not for you, he almost said. it’s too tough a game for
you.
yet in the awful majesty of her pain he went out to her
unreservedly, almost sexually. he wanted to gather her up
in his arms, as he so often had nicole, and cherish even her
mistakes, so deeply were they part of her. the orange light
through the drawn blind, the sarcophagus of her figure on
the bed, the spot of face, the voice searching the vacuity of
her illness and finding only remote abstractions.
as he arose the tears fled lava-like into her bandages.
‘that is for something,’ she whispered. ‘something must
come out of it.’
he stooped and kissed her forehead.
‘we must all try to be good,’ he said.
leaving her room he sent the nurse in to her. there were
other patients to see: an american girl of fifteen who had
been brought up on the basis that childhood was intended
to be all fun—his visit was provoked by the fact that she
had just hacked off all her hair with a nail scissors. there
was nothing much to be done for her—a family history of
neurosis and nothing stable in her past to build on. the
father, normal and conscientious himself, had tried to protect
a nervous brood from life’s troubles and had succeeded
merely in preventing them from developing powers of adjustment
to life’s inevitable surprises. there was little that
dick could say: ‘helen, when you’re in doubt you must ask a 
274 tender is the night
nurse, you must learn to take advice. promise me you will.’
what was a promise with the head sick? he looked in
upon a frail exile from the caucasus buckled securely in a
sort of hammock which in turn was submerged in a warm
medical bath, and upon the three daughters of a portuguese
general who slid almost imperceptibly toward paresis. he
went into the room next to them and told a collapsed psychiatrist
that he was better, always better, and the man tried
to read his face for conviction, since he hung on the real
world only through such reassurance as he could find in the
resonance, or lack of it, in doctor diver’s voice. after that
dick discharged a shiftless orderly and by then it was the
lunch hour.

meals with the patients were a chore he approached
with apathy. the gathering, which of course did not include
residents at the eglantine or the beeches, was conventional
enough at first sight, but over it brooded always a heavy
melancholy. such doctors as were present kept up a conversation
but most of the patients, as if exhausted by their
morning’s endeavor, or depressed by the company, spoke
little, and ate looking into their plates.
luncheon over, dick returned to his villa. nicole was in
the salon wearing a strange expression.
‘read that,’ she said.
he opened the letter. it was from a woman recently discharged,
though with skepticism on the part of the faculty.
it accused him in no uncertain terms of having seduced her
daughter, who had been at her mother’s side during the crucial
stage of the illness. it presumed that mrs. diver would
be glad to have this information and learn what her husband
was ‘really like.’
dick read the letter again. couched in clear and concise
english he yet recognized it as the letter of a maniac. upon
a single occasion he had let the girl, a flirtatious little brunette,
ride into zurich with him, upon her request, and in
the evening had brought her back to the clinic. in an idle,
almost indulgent way, he kissed her. later, she tried to carry 
276 tender is the night
the affair further, but he was not interested and subsequently,
probably consequently, the girl had come to dislike him,
and taken her mother away.
‘this letter is deranged,’ he said. ‘i had no relations of any
kind with that girl. i didn’t even like her.’
‘yes, i’ve tried thinking that,’ said nicole.
‘surely you don’t believe it?’
‘i’ve been sitting here.’
he sank his voice to a reproachful note and sat beside
her.
‘this is absurd. this is a letter from a mental patient.’
‘i was a mental patient.’
he stood up and spoke more authoritatively.
‘suppose we don’t have any nonsense, nicole. go and
round up the children and we’ll start.’
in the car, with dick driving, they followed the little
promontories of the lake, catching the burn of light and
water in the windshield, tunnelling through cascades of evergreen.
it was dick’s car, a renault so dwarfish that they
all stuck out of it except the children, between whom mademoiselle
towered mastlike in the rear seat. they knew every
kilometer of the road—where they would smell the pine
needles and the black stove smoke. a high sun with a face
traced on it beat fierce on the straw hats of the children.
nicole was silent; dick was uneasy at her straight hard
gaze. often he felt lonely with her, and frequently she tired
him with the short floods of personal revelations that she
reserved exclusively for him, ‘i’m like this—i’m more like
that,’ but this afternoon he would have been glad had she 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 277
rattled on in staccato for a while and given him glimpses
of her thoughts. the situation was always most threatening
when she backed up into herself and closed the doors
behind her.
at zug mademoiselle got out and left them. the divers
approached the agiri fair through a menagerie of mammoth
steamrollers that made way for them. dick parked the
car, and as nicole looked at him without moving, he said:
‘come on, darl.’ her lips drew apart into a sudden awful
smile, and his belly quailed, but as if he hadn’t seen it he repeated:
‘come on. so the children can get out.’
‘oh, i’ll come all right,’ she answered, tearing the words
from some story spinning itself out inside her, too fast for
him to grasp. ‘don’t worry about that. i’ll come—‘
‘then come.’
she turned from him as he walked beside her but the
smile still flickered across her face, derisive and remote.
only when lanier spoke to her several times did she manage
to fix her attention upon an object, a punch-and-judy
show, and to orient herself by anchoring to it.
dick tried to think what to do. the dualism in his views
of her— that of the husband, that of the psychiatrist—was
increasingly paralyzing his faculties. in these six years she
had several times carried him over the line with her, disarming
him by exciting emotional pity or by a flow of wit,
fantastic and disassociated, so that only after the episode
did he realize with the consciousness of his own relaxation
from tension, that she had succeeded in getting a point
against his better judgment.
278 tender is the night
a discussion with topsy about the guignol—as to whether
the punch was the same punch they had seen last year
in cannes—having been settled, the family walked along
again between the booths under the open sky. the women’s
bonnets, perching over velvet vests, the bright, spreading
skirts of many cantons, seemed demure against the blue
and orange paint of the wagons and displays. there was the
sound of a whining, tinkling hootchy-kootchy show.
nicole began to run very suddenly, so suddenly that for
a moment dick did not miss her. far ahead he saw her yellow
dress twisting through the crowd, an ochre stitch along
the edge of reality and unreality, and started after her. secretly
she ran and secretly he followed. as the hot afternoon
went shrill and terrible with her flight he had forgotten the
children; then he wheeled and ran back to them, drawing
them this way and that by their arms, his eyes jumping from
booth to booth.
‘madame,’ he cried to a young woman behind a white
lottery wheel, ‘est-ce que je peux laisser ces petits avec
vous deux minutes? c’est très urgent—je vous donnerai dix
francs.’
‘mais oui.’
he headed the children into the booth. ‘alors—restez
avec cette gentille dame.’
‘oui, dick.’
he darted off again but he had lost her; he circled the
merry-goround keeping up with it till he realized he was
running beside it, staring always at the same horse. he elbowed
through the crowd in the buvette; then remembering 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 279
a predilection of nicole’s he snatched up an edge of a fortuneteller’s
tent and peered within. a droning voice greeted
him: ‘la septième fille d’une septième fille née sur les rives
du nil—entrez, monsieur—‘
dropping the flap he ran along toward where the plaisance
terminated at the lake and a small ferris wheel
revolved slowly against the sky. there he found her.
she was alone in what was momentarily the top boat of
the wheel, and as it descended he saw that she was laughing
hilariously; he slunk back in the crowd, a crowd which, at
the wheel’s next revolution, spotted the intensity of nicole’s
hysteria.
‘regardez-moi ça!’
‘regarde donc cette anglaise!’
down she dropped again—this time the wheel and its
music were slowing and a dozen people were around her
car, all of them impelled by the quality of her laughter to
smile in sympathetic idiocy. but when nicole saw dick her
laughter died—she made a gesture of slipping by and away
from him but he caught her arm and held it as they walked
away.
‘why did you lose control of yourself like that?’
‘you know very well why.’
‘no, i don’t.’
‘that’s just preposterous—let me loose—that’s an insult
to my intelligence. don’t you think i saw that girl look at
you—that little dark girl. oh, this is farcical—a child, not
more than fifteen. don’t you think i saw?’
‘stop here a minute and quiet down.’
280 tender is the night
they sat at a table, her eyes in a profundity of suspicion,
her hand moving across her line of sight as if it were obstructed.
‘i want a drink—i want a brandy.’
‘you can’t have brandy—you can have a bock if you want
it.’
‘why can’t i have a brandy?’
‘we won’t go into that. listen to me—this business about
a girl is a delusion, do you understand that word?’
‘it’s always a delusion when i see what you don’t want
me to see.’
he had a sense of guilt as in one of those nightmares
where we are accused of a crime which we recognize as
something undeniably experienced, but which upon waking
we realize we have not committed. his eyes wavered
from hers.
‘i left the children with a gypsy woman in a booth. we
ought to get them.’
‘who do you think you are?’ she demanded. ‘svengali?’
fifteen minutes ago they had been a family. now as she
was crushed into a corner by his unwilling shoulder, he saw
them all, child and man, as a perilous accident.
‘we’re going home.’
‘home!’ she roared in a voice so abandoned that its louder
tones wavered and cracked. ‘and sit and think that we’re
all rotting and the children’s ashes are rotting in every box
i open? that filth!’
almost with relief he saw that her words sterilized her,
and nicole, sensitized down to the corium of the skin, saw
the withdrawal in his face. her own face softened and she 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 281
begged, ‘help me, help me, dick!’
a wave of agony went over him. it was awful that such a
fine tower should not be erected, only suspended, suspended
from him. up to a point that was right: men were for
that, beam and idea, girder and logarithm; but somehow
dick and nicole had become one and equal, not opposite
and complementary; she was dick too, the drought in the
marrow of his bones. he could not watch her disintegrations
without participating in them. his intuition rilled
out of him as tenderness and compassion—he could only
take the characteristically modern course, to interpose—he
would get a nurse from zurich, to take her over to-night.
‘you can help me.’
her sweet bullying pulled him forward off his feet.
‘you’ve helped me before—you can help me now.’
‘i can only help you the same old way.’
‘some one can help me.’
‘maybe so. you can help yourself most. let’s find the
children.’
there were numerous lottery booths with white
wheels—dick was startled when he inquired at the first
and encountered blank disavowals. evil-eyed, nicole stood
apart, denying the children, resenting them as part of a
downright world she sought to make amorphous. presently
dick found them, surrounded by women who were examining
them with delight like fine goods, and by peasant
children staring.
‘merci, monsieur, ah monsieur est trop généreux. c’était
un plaisir, m’sieur, madame. au revoir, mes petits.’
282 tender is the night
they started back with a hot sorrow streaming down
upon them; the car was weighted with their mutual apprehension
and anguish, and the children’s mouths were grave
with disappointment. grief presented itself in its terrible,
dark unfamiliar color. somewhere around zug, nicole,
with a convulsive effort, reiterated a remark she had made
before about a misty yellow house set back from the road
that looked like a painting not yet dry, but it was just an attempt
to catch at a rope that was playing out too swiftly.
dick tried to rest—the struggle would come presently at
home and he might have to sit a long time, restating the
universe for her. a ‘schizophrêne’ is well named as a split
personality—nicole was alternately a person to whom nothing
need be explained and one to whom nothing could be
explained. it was necessary to treat her with active and affirmative
insistence, keeping the road to reality always open,
making the road to escape harder going. but the brilliance,
the versatility of madness is akin to the resourcefulness of
water seeping through, over and around a dike. it requires
the united front of many people to work against it. he felt
it necessary that this time nicole cure herself; he wanted
to wait until she remembered the other times, and revolted
from them. in a tired way, he planned that they would again
resume the régime relaxed a year before.
he had turned up a hill that made a short cut to the
clinic, and now as he stepped on the accelerator for a short
straightaway run parallel to the hillside the car swerved violently
left, swerved right, tipped on two wheels and, as dick,
with nicole’s voice screaming in his ear, crushed down 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 283
the mad hand clutching the steering wheel, righted itself,
swerved once more and shot off the road; it tore through
low underbrush, tipped again and settled slowly at an angle
of ninety degrees against a tree.
the children were screaming and nicole was screaming
and cursing and trying to tear at dick’s face. thinking first
of the list of the car and unable to estimate it dick bent away
nicole’s arm, climbed over the top side and lifted out the
children; then he saw the car was in a stable position. before
doing anything else he stood there shaking and panting.
‘you—!’ he cried.
she was laughing hilariously, unashamed, unafraid,
unconcerned. no one coming on the scene would have
imagined that she had caused it; she laughed as after some
mild escape of childhood.
‘you were scared, weren’t you?’ she accused him. ‘you
wanted to live!’
she spoke with such force that in his shocked state dick
wondered if he had been frightened for himself—but the
strained faces of the children, looking from parent to parent,
made him want to grind her grinning mask into jelly.
directly above them, half a kilometer by the winding
road but only a hundred yards climbing, was an inn; one of
its wings showed through the wooded hill.
‘take topsy’s hand,’ he said to lanier, ‘like that, tight,
and climb up that hill—see the little path? when you get
to the inn tell them ‘la voiture divare est cassée.’ some one
must come right down.’
lanier, not sure what had happened, but suspecting the 
284 tender is the night
dark and unprecedented, asked:
‘what will you do, dick?’
‘we’ll stay here with the car.’
neither of them looked at their mother as they started
off. ‘be careful crossing the road up there! look both ways!’
dick shouted after them.
he and nicole looked at each other directly, their eyes
like blazing windows across a court of the same house. then
she took out a compact, looked in its mirror, and smoothed
back the temple hair. dick watched the children climbing
for a moment until they disappeared among the pines half
way up; then he walked around the car to see the damage
and plan how to get it back on the road. in the dirt he could
trace the rocking course they had pursued for over a hundred
feet; he was filled with a violent disgust that was not
like anger.
in a few minutes the proprietor of the inn came running
down.
‘my god!’ he exclaimed. ‘how did it happen, were you
going fast? what luck! except for that tree you’d have rolled
down hill!’
taking advantage of emile’s reality, the wide black
apron, the sweat upon the rolls of his face, dick signalled to
nicole in a matter-of-fact way to let him help her from the
car; whereupon she jumped over the lower side, lost her balance
on the slope, fell to her knees and got up again. as she
watched the men trying to move the car her expression became
defiant. welcoming even that mood dick said:
‘go and wait with the children, nicole.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 285
only after she had gone did he remember that she had
wanted cognac, and that there was cognac available up
there—he told emile never mind about the car; they would
wait for the chauffeur and the big car to pull it up onto the
road. together they hurried up to the inn.
286 tender is the night

‘i want to go away,’ he told franz. ‘for a month or so, for
as long as i can.’
‘why not, dick? that was our original arrangement—it
was you who insisted on staying. if you and nicole—‘
‘i don’t want to go away with nicole. i want to go away
alone. this last thing knocked me sideways—if i get two
hours’ sleep in twenty-four, it’s one of zwingli’s miracles.’
‘you wish a real leave of abstinence.’
‘the word is ‘absence.’ look here: if i go to berlin to the
psychiatric congress could you manage to keep the peace?
for three months she’s been all right and she likes her nurse.
my god, you’re the only human being in this world i can
ask this of.’
franz grunted, considering whether or not he could be
trusted to think always of his partner’s interest.
in zurich the next week dick drove to the airport and
took the big plane for munich. soaring and roaring into the
blue he felt numb, realizing how tired he was. a vast persuasive
quiet stole over him, and he abandoned sickness to the
sick, sound to the motors, direction to the pilot. he had no
intention of attending so much as a single session of the congress—he
could imagine it well enough, new pamphlets by
bleuler and the elder forel that he could much better digest
at home, the paper by the american who cured demen-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 287
tia præcox by pulling out his patient’s teeth or cauterizing
their tonsils, the half-derisive respect with which this idea
would be greeted, for no more reason than that america
was such a rich and powerful country. the other delegates
from america—red-headed schwartz with his saint’s face
and his infinite patience in straddling two worlds, as well
as dozens of commercial alienists with hang-dog faces,
who would be present partly to increase their standing, and
hence their reach for the big plums of the criminal practice,
partly to master novel sophistries that they could weave into
their stock in trade, to the infinite confusion of all values.
there would be cynical latins, and some man of freud’s
from vienna. articulate among them would be the great
jung, bland, supervigorous, on his rounds between the
forests of anthropology and the neuroses of school-boys.
at first there would be an american cast to the congress,
almost rotarian in its forms and ceremonies, then the closer-knit
european vitality would fight through, and finally
the americans would play their trump card, the announcement
of colossal gifts and endowments, of great new plants
and training schools, and in the presence of the figures the
europeans would blanch and walk timidly. but he would
not be there to see.
they skirted the vorarlberg alps, and dick felt a pastoral
delight in watching the villages. there were always four or
five in sight, each one gathered around a church. it was simple
looking at the earth from far off, simple as playing grim
games with dolls and soldiers. this was the way statesmen
and commanders and all retired people looked at things. 
288 tender is the night
anyhow, it was a good draft of relief.
an englishman spoke to him from across the aisle but he
found something antipathetic in the english lately. england
was like a rich man after a disastrous orgy who makes up to
the household by chatting with them individually, when it
is obvious to them that he is only trying to get back his selfrespect
in order to usurp his former power.
dick had with him what magazines were available
on the station quays: the century, the motion picture,
l’lllustration, and the fliegende blätter, but it was more fun
to descend in his imagination into the villages and shake
hands with the rural characters. he sat in the churches as he
sat in his father’s church in buffalo, amid the starchy must
of sunday clothes. he listened to the wisdom of the near
east, was crucified, died, and was buried in the cheerful
church, and once more worried between five or ten cents
for the collection plate, because of the girl who sat in the
pew behind.
the englishman suddenly borrowed his magazines with
a little small change of conversation, and dick, glad to see
them go, thought of the voyage ahead of him. wolf-like under
his sheep’s clothing of long-staple australian wool, he
considered the world of pleasure— the incorruptible mediterranean
with sweet old dirt caked in the olive trees, the
peasant girl near savona with a face as green and rose as
the color of an illuminated missal. he would take her in his
hands and snatch her across the border ...
... but there he deserted her—he must press on toward
the isles of greece, the cloudy waters of unfamiliar ports, 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 289
the lost girl on shore, the moon of popular songs. a part
of dick’s mind was made up of the tawdry souvenirs of his
boyhood. yet in that somewhat littered five-and-ten, he
had managed to keep alive the low painful fire of intelligence.

tommy barban was a ruler, tommy was a hero—dick happened
upon him in the marienplatz in munich, in one of
those cafés, where small gamblers diced on ‘tapestry’ mats.
the air was full of politics, and the slap of cards.
tommy was at a table laughing his martial laugh: ‘umbuh—ha-ha!
um-buh—ha-ha!’ as a rule, he drank little;
courage was his game and his companions were always a
little afraid of him. recently an eighth of the area of his
skull had been removed by a warsaw surgeon and was knitting
under his hair, and the weakest person in the café could
have killed him with a flip of a knotted napkin.
‘—this is prince chillicheff—‘ a battered, powder-gray
russian of fifty, ‘—and mr. mckibben—and mr. hannan—‘
the latter was a lively ball of black eyes and hair, a clown;
and he said immediately to dick:
‘the first thing before we shake hands—what do you
mean by fooling around with my aunt?’
‘why, i—‘
‘you heard me. what are you doing here in munich anyhow?’
‘um-bah—ha-ha!’ laughed tommy.
‘haven’t you got aunts of your own? why don’t you fool
with them?’
dick laughed, whereupon the man shifted his attack:
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 291
‘now let’s not have any more talk about aunts. how do
i know you didn’t make up the whole thing? here you are
a complete stranger with an acquaintance of less than half
an hour, and you come up to me with a cock-and-bull story
about your aunts. how do i know what you have concealed
about you?’
tommy laughed again, then he said good-naturedly, but
firmly, ‘that’s enough, carly. sit down, dick—how’re you?
how’s nicole?’
he did not like any man very much nor feel their presence
with much intensity—he was all relaxed for combat;
as a fine athlete playing secondary defense in any sport is
really resting much of the time, while a lesser man only
pretends to rest and is at a continual and self-destroying
nervous tension.
hannan, not entirely suppressed, moved to an adjoining
piano, and with recurring resentment on his face whenever
he looked at dick, played chords, from time to time muttering,
‘your aunts,’ and, in a dying cadence, ‘i didn’t say aunts
anyhow. i said pants.’
‘well, how’re you?’ repeated tommy. ‘you don’t look
so—‘ he fought for a word, ‘—so jaunty as you used to, so
spruce, you know what i mean.’
the remark sounded too much like one of those irritating
accusations of waning vitality and dick was about to
retort by commenting on the extraordinary suits worn by
tommy and prince chillicheff, suits of a cut and pattern
fantastic enough to have sauntered down beale street on a
sunday—when an explanation was forthcoming.

‘i see you are regarding our clothes,’ said the prince. ‘we
have just come out of russia.’
‘these were made in poland by the court tailor,’ said
tommy. ‘that’s a fact—pilsudski’s own tailor.’
‘you’ve been touring?’ dick asked.
they laughed, the prince inordinately meanwhile clapping
tommy on the back.
‘yes, we have been touring. that’s it, touring. we have
made the grand tour of all the russias. in state.’
dick waited for an explanation. it came from mr. mckibben
in two words.
‘they escaped.’
‘have you been prisoners in russia?’
‘it was i,’ explained prince chillicheff, his dead yellow
eyes staring at dick. ‘not a prisoner but in hiding.’
‘did you have much trouble getting out?’
‘some trouble. we left three red guards dead at the
border. tommy left two—‘ he held up two fingers like a
frenchman—‘i left one.’
‘that’s the part i don’t understand,’ said mr. mckibben.
‘why they should have objected to your leaving.’
hannan turned from the piano and said, winking at the
others: ‘mac thinks a marxian is somebody who went to st.
mark’s school.’
it was an escape story in the best tradition—an aristocrat
hiding nine years with a former servant and working in a
government bakery; the eighteen-year-old daughter in paris
who knew tommy barban... . during the narrative dick
decided that this parched papier mâché relic of the past was 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 293
scarcely worth the lives of three young men. the question
arose as to whether tommy and chillicheff had been frightened.
‘when i was cold,’ tommy said. ‘i always get scared when
i’m cold. during the war i was always frightened when i
was cold.’
mckibben stood up.
‘i must leave. to-morrow morning i’m going to innsbruck
by car with my wife and children—and the governess.’
‘i’m going there to-morrow, too,’ said dick.
‘oh, are you?’ exclaimed mckibben. ‘why not come with
us? it’s a big packard and there’s only my wife and my children
and myself— and the governess—‘
‘i can’t possibly—‘
‘of course she’s not really a governess,’ mckibben concluded,
looking rather pathetically at dick. ‘as a matter of
fact my wife knows your sister-in-law, baby warren.’
but dick was not to be drawn in a blind contract.
‘i’ve promised to travel with two men.’
‘oh,’ mckibben’s face fell. ‘well, i’ll say good-by.’ he unscrewed
two blooded wire-hairs from a nearby table and
departed; dick pictured the jammed packard pounding toward
innsbruck with the mckibbens and their children and
their baggage and yapping dogs— and the governess.
‘the paper says they know the man who killed him,’ said
tommy. ‘but his cousins did not want it in the papers, because
it happened in a speakeasy. what do you think of
that?’
‘it’s what’s known as family pride.’
294 tender is the night
hannan played a loud chord on the piano to attract attention
to himself.
‘i don’t believe his first stuff holds up,’ he said. ‘even barring
the europeans there are a dozen americans can do
what north did.’
it was the first indication dick had had that they were
talking about abe north.
‘the only difference is that abe did it first,’ said tommy.
‘i don’t agree,’ persisted hannan. ‘he got the reputation
for being a good musician because he drank so much that
his friends had to explain him away somehow—‘
‘what’s this about abe north? what about him? is he
in a jam?’
‘didn’t you read the herald this morning?’
‘no.’
‘he’s dead. he was beaten to death in a speakeasy in new
york. he just managed to crawl home to the racquet club
to die—‘
‘abe north?’
‘yes, sure, they—‘
‘abe north?’ dick stood up. ‘are you sure he’s dead?’
hannan turned around to mckibben: ‘it wasn’t the racquet
club he crawled to—it was the harvard club. i’m sure
he didn’t belong to the racquet.’
‘the paper said so,’ mckibben insisted.
‘it must have been a mistake. i’m quite sure.’
‘beaten to death in a speakeasy.’
‘but i happen to know most of the members of the racquet
club,’ said hannan. ‘it must have been the harvard 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 295
club.’
dick got up, tommy too. prince chillicheff started out
of a wan study of nothing, perhaps of his chances of ever
getting out of russia, a study that had occupied him so long
that it was doubtful if he could give it up immediately, and
joined them in leaving.
‘abe north beaten to death.’
on the way to the hotel, a journey of which dick was
scarcely aware, tommy said:
‘we’re waiting for a tailor to finish some suits so we can
get to paris. i’m going into stock-broking and they wouldn’t
take me if i showed up like this. everybody in your country
is making millions. are you really leaving to-morrow? we
can’t even have dinner with you. it seems the prince had an
old girl in munich. he called her up but she’d been dead five
years and we’re having dinner with the two daughters.’
the prince nodded.
‘perhaps i could have arranged for doctor diver.’
‘no, no,’ said dick hastily.
he slept deep and awoke to a slow mournful march passing
his window. it was a long column of men in uniform,
wearing the familiar helmet of 1914, thick men in frock
coats and silk hats, burghers, aristocrats, plain men. it was
a society of veterans going to lay wreaths on the tombs of
the dead. the column marched slowly with a sort of swagger
for a lost magnificence, a past effort, a forgotten sorrow.
the faces were only formally sad but dick’s lungs burst for
a moment with regret for abe’s death, and his own youth of
ten years ago.
296 tender is the night
xviii
he reached innsbruck at dusk, sent his bags up to a hotel
and walked into town. in the sunset the emperor maximilian
knelt in prayer above his bronze mourners; a quartet
of jesuit novices paced and read in the university garden.
the marble souvenirs of old sieges, marriages, anniversaries,
faded quickly when the sun was down, and he had
erbsen-suppe with würstchen cut up in it, drank four helles
of pilsener and refused a formidable dessert known as
‘kaiser-schmarren.’
despite the overhanging mountains switzerland was far
away, nicole was far away. walking in the garden later when
it was quite dark he thought about her with detachment,
loving her for her best self. he remembered once when the
grass was damp and she came to him on hurried feet, her
thin slippers drenched with dew. she stood upon his shoes
nestling close and held up her face, showing it as a book
open at a page.
‘think how you love me,’ she whispered. ‘i don’t ask
you to love me always like this, but i ask you to remember.
somewhere inside me there’ll always be the person i am tonight.’
but dick had come away for his soul’s sake, and he began
thinking about that. he had lost himself—he could not
tell the hour when, or the day or the week, the month or 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 297
the year. once he had cut through things, solving the most
complicated equations as the simplest problems of his simplest
patients. between the time he found nicole flowering
under a stone on the zurichsee and the moment of his meeting
with rosemary the spear had been blunted.
watching his father’s struggles in poor parishes had
wedded a desire for money to an essentially unacquisitive
nature. it was not a healthy necessity for security—he had
never felt more sure of himself, more thoroughly his own
man, than at the time of his marriage to nicole. yet he had
been swallowed up like a gigolo, and somehow permitted
his arsenal to be locked up in the warren safety-deposit
vaults.
‘there should have been a settlement in the continental
style; but it isn’t over yet. i’ve wasted eight years teaching
the rich the abc’s of human decency, but i’m not done. i’ve
got too many unplayed trumps in my hand.’
he loitered among the fallow rose bushes and the beds
of damp sweet indistinguishable fern. it was warm for october
but cool enough to wear a heavy tweed coat buttoned
by a little elastic tape at the neck. a figure detached itself
from the black shape of a tree and he knew it was the woman
whom he had passed in the lobby coming out. he was in
love with every pretty woman he saw now, their forms at a
distance, their shadows on a wall.
her back was toward him as she faced the lights of the
town. he scratched a match that she must have heard, but
she remained motionless.
—was it an invitation? or an indication of obliviousness? 
298 tender is the night
he had long been outside of the world of simple desires and
their fulfillments, and he was inept and uncertain. for all
he knew there might be some code among the wanderers of
obscure spas by which they found each other quickly.
—perhaps the next gesture was his. strange children
should smile at each other and say, ‘let’s play.’
he moved closer, the shadow moved sideways. possibly
he would be snubbed like the scapegrace drummers he had
heard of in youth. his heart beat loud in contact with the
unprobed, undissected, unanalyzed, unaccounted for. suddenly
he turned away, and, as he did, the girl, too, broke the
black frieze she made with the foliage, rounded a bench at
a moderate but determined pace and took the path back to
the hotel.
with a guide and two other men, dick started up the
birkkarspitze next morning. it was a fine feeling once they
were above the cowbells of the highest pastures—dick
looked forward to the night in the shack, enjoying his own
fatigue, enjoying the captaincy of the guide, feeling a delight
in his own anonymity. but at mid-day the weather changed
to black sleet and hail and mountain thunder. dick and one
of the other climbers wanted to go on but the guide refused.
regretfully they struggled back to innsbruck to start again
to-morrow.
after dinner and a bottle of heavy local wine in the deserted
dining-room, he felt excited, without knowing why,
until he began thinking of the garden. he had passed the
girl in the lobby before supper and this time she had looked
at him and approved of him, but it kept worrying him: why? 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 299
when i could have had a good share of the pretty women of
my time for the asking, why start that now? with a wraith,
with a fragment of my desire? why?
his imagination pushed ahead—the old asceticism, the
actual unfamiliarity, triumphed: god, i might as well go
back to the riviera and sleep with janice caricamento or
the wilburhazy girl. to belittle all these years with something
cheap and easy?
he was still excited, though, and he turned from the
veranda and went up to his room to think. being alone
in body and spirit begets loneliness, and loneliness begets
more loneliness.
upstairs he walked around thinking of the matter and
laying out his climbing clothes advantageously on the
faint heater; he again encountered nicole’s telegram, still
unopened, with which diurnally she accompanied his itinerary.
he had delayed opening it before supper—perhaps
because of the garden. it was a cablegram from buffalo, forwarded
through zurich.
‘your father died peacefully tonight. holmes.’
he felt a sharp wince at the shock, a gathering of the
forces of resistance; then it rolled up through his loins and
stomach and throat.
he read the message again. he sat down on the bed,
breathing and staring; thinking first the old selfish child’s
thought that comes with the death of a parent, how will it
affect me now that this earliest and strongest of protections
is gone?
the atavism passed and he walked the room still, stop-
300 tender is the night
ping from time to time to look at the telegram. holmes was
formally his father’s curate but actually, and for a decade,
rector of the church. how did he die? of old age—he was
seventy-five. he had lived a long time.
dick felt sad that he had died alone—he had survived
his wife, and his brothers and sisters; there were cousins in
virginia but they were poor and not able to come north,
and holmes had had to sign the telegram. dick loved his
father—again and again he referred judgments to what his
father would probably have thought or done. dick was born
several months after the death of two young sisters and his
father, guessing what would be the effect on dick’s mother,
had saved him from a spoiling by becoming his moral
guide. he was of tired stock yet he raised himself to that
effort.
in the summer father and son walked downtown together
to have their shoes shined—dick in his starched
duck sailor suit, his father always in beautifully cut clerical
clothes—and the father was very proud of his handsome
little boy. he told dick all he knew about life, not much but
most of it true, simple things, matters of behavior that came
within his clergyman’s range. ‘once in a strange town when
i was first ordained, i went into a crowded room and was
confused as to who was my hostess. several people i knew
came toward me, but i disregarded them because i had seen
a grayhaired woman sitting by a window far across the
room. i went over to her and introduced myself. after that i
made many friends in that town.’
his father had done that from a good heart—his father 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 301
had been sure of what he was, with a deep pride of the two
proud widows who had raised him to believe that nothing
could be superior to ‘good instincts,’ honor, courtesy, and
courage.
the father always considered that his wife’s small fortune
belonged to his son, and in college and in medical school
sent him a check for all of it four times a year. he was one
of those about whom it was said with smug finality in the
gilded age: ‘very much the gentleman, but not much get-upand-go
about him.’
... dick sent down for a newspaper. still pacing to and
from the telegram open on his bureau, he chose a ship to
go to america. then he put in a call for nicole in zurich,
remembering so many things as he waited, and wishing he
had always been as good as he had intended to be.
302 tender is the night

for an hour, tied up with his profound reaction to his father’s
death, the magnificent façade of the homeland, the
harbor of new york, seemed all sad and glorious to dick,
but once ashore the feeling vanished, nor did he find it
again in the streets or the hotels or the trains that bore him
first to buffalo, and then south to virginia with his father’s
body. only as the local train shambled into the low-forested
clayland of westmoreland county, did he feel once more
identified with his surroundings; at the station he saw a star
he knew, and a cold moon bright over chesapeake bay; he
heard the rasping wheels of buckboards turning, the lovely
fatuous voices, the sound of sluggish primeval rivers flowing
softly under soft indian names.
next day at the churchyard his father was laid among a
hundred divers, dorseys, and hunters. it was very friendly
leaving him there with all his relations around him. flowers
were scattered on the brown unsettled earth. dick had
no more ties here now and did not believe he would come
back. he knelt on the hard soil. these dead, he knew them
all, their weather-beaten faces with blue flashing eyes, the
spare violent bodies, the souls made of new earth in the forest-heavy
darkness of the seventeenth century.
‘good-by, my father—good-by, all my fathers.’
on the long-roofed steamship piers one is in a country 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 303
that is no longer here and not yet there. the hazy yellow
vault is full of echoing shouts. there are the rumble of trucks
and the clump of trunks, the strident chatter of cranes, the
first salt smell of the sea. one hurries through, even though
there’s time; the past, the continent, is behind; the future is
the glowing mouth in the side of the ship; the dim, turbulent
alley is too confusedly the present.
up the gangplank and the vision of the world adjusts itself,
narrows. one is a citizen of a commonwealth smaller
than andorra, no longer sure of anything. the men at the
purser’s desk are as oddly shaped as the cabins; disdainful
are the eyes of voyagers and their friends. next the loud
mournful whistles, the portentous vibration and the boat,
the human idea—is in motion. the pier and its faces slide
by and for a moment the boat is a piece accidentally split off
from them; the faces become remote, voiceless, the pier is
one of many blurs along the water front. the harbor flows
swiftly toward the sea.
with it flowed albert mckisco, labelled by the newspapers
as its most precious cargo. mckisco was having a
vogue. his novels were pastiches of the work of the best people
of his time, a feat not to be disparaged, and in addition
he possessed a gift for softening and debasing what he borrowed,
so that many readers were charmed by the ease with
which they could follow him. success had improved him
and humbled him. he was no fool about his capacities—he
realized that he possessed more vitality than many men of
superior talent, and he was resolved to enjoy the success he
had earned. ‘i’ve done nothing yet,’ he would say. ‘i don’t 
304 tender is the night
think i’ve got any real genius. but if i keep trying i may
write a good book.’ fine dives have been made from flimsier
spring-boards. the innumerable snubs of the past were
forgotten. indeed, his success was founded psychologically
upon his duel with tommy barban, upon the basis of which,
as it withered in his memory, he had created, afresh, a new
self-respect.
spotting dick diver the second day out, he eyed him
tentatively, then introduced himself in a friendly way and
sat down. dick laid aside his reading and, after the few
minutes that it took to realize the change in mckisco, the
disappearance of the man’s annoying sense of inferiority,
found himself pleased to talk to him. mckisco was ‘wellinformed’
on a range of subjects wider than goethe’s—it
was interesting to listen to the innumerable facile combinations
that he referred to as his opinions. they struck up an
acquaintance, and dick had several meals with them. the
mckiscos had been invited to sit at the captain’s table but
with nascent snobbery they told dick that they ‘couldn’t
stand that bunch.’
violet was very grand now, decked out by the grand couturières,
charmed about the little discoveries that well-bred
girls make in their teens. she could, indeed, have learned
them from her mother in boise but her soul was born dismally
in the small movie houses of idaho, and she had had
no time for her mother. now she ‘belonged’—together with
several million other people—and she was happy, though
her husband still shushed her when she grew violently na-
ïve.

the mckiscos got off at gibraltar. next evening in naples
dick picked up a lost and miserable family of two girls and
their mother in the bus from the hotel to the station. he had
seen them on the ship. an overwhelming desire to help, or
to be admired, came over him: he showed them fragments
of gaiety; tentatively he bought them wine, with pleasure
saw them begin to regain their proper egotism. he pretended
they were this and that, and falling in with his own plot,
and drinking too much to sustain the illusion, and all this
time the women, thought only that this was a windfall from
heaven. he withdrew from them as the night waned and the
train rocked and snorted at cassino and frosinone. after
weird american partings in the station at rome, dick went
to the hotel quirinal, somewhat exhausted.
at the desk he suddenly stared and upped his head. as if
a drink were acting on him, warming the lining of his stomach,
throwing a flush up into his brain, he saw the person
he had come to see, the person for whom he had made the
mediterranean crossing.
simultaneously rosemary saw him, acknowledging him
before placing him; she looked back startled, and, leaving
the girl she was with, she hurried over. holding himself
erect, holding his breath, dick turned to her. as she came
across the lobby, her beauty all groomed, like a young horse
dosed with black-seed oil, and hoops varnished, shocked
him awake; but it all came too quick for him to do anything
except conceal his fatigue as best he could. to meet
her starry-eyed confidence he mustered an insincere pantomime
implying, ‘you would turn up here—of all the 
306 tender is the night
people in the world.’
her gloved hands closed over his on the desk; ‘dick—
we’re making the grandeur that was rome—at least we
think we are; we may quit any day.’
he looked at her hard, trying to make her a little self-conscious,
so that she would observe less closely his unshaven
face, his crumpled and slept-in collar. fortunately, she was
in a hurry.
‘we begin early because the mists rise at eleven—phone
me at two.’
in his room dick collected his faculties. he left a call for
noon, stripped off his clothes and dove literally into a heavy
sleep.
he slept over the phone call but awoke at two, refreshed.
unpacking his bag, he sent out suits and laundry. he shaved,
lay for half an hour in a warm bath and had breakfast. the
sun had dipped into the via nazionale and he let it through
the portières with a jingling of old brass rings. waiting for
a suit to be pressed, he discovered from the corriere della
sera that ‘una novella di sinclair lewis ‘wall street’ nella
quale autore analizza la vita sociale di una piccola citta
americana.’ then he tried to think about rosemary.
at first he thought nothing. she was young and magnetic,
but so was topsy. he guessed that she had had lovers and
had loved them in the last four years. well, you never knew
exactly how much space you occupied in people’s lives. yet
from this fog his affection emerged—the best contacts are
when one knows the obstacles and still wants to preserve
a relation. the past drifted back and he wanted to hold her 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 307
eloquent giving-of-herself in its precious shell, till he enclosed
it, till it no longer existed outside him. he tried to
collect all that might attract her—it was less than it had been
four years ago. eighteen might look at thirty-four through a
rising mist of adolescence; but twenty-two would see thirtyeight
with discerning clarity. moreover, dick had been at an
emotional peak at the time of the previous encounter; since
then there had been a lesion of enthusiasm.
when the valet returned he put on a white shirt and
collar and a black tie with a pearl; the cords of his reading-glasses
passed through another pearl of the same size
that swung a casual inch below. after sleep, his face had resumed
the ruddy brown of many riviera summers, and to
limber himself up he stood on his hands on a chair until his
fountain pen and coins fell out. at three he called rosemary
and was bidden to come up. momentarily dizzy from his acrobatics,
he stopped in the bar for a gin-and-tonic.
‘hi, doctor diver!’
only because of rosemary’s presence in the hotel did
dick place the man immediately as collis clay. he had
his old confidence and an air of prosperity and big sudden
jowls.
‘do you know rosemary’s here?’ collis asked.
‘i ran into her.’
‘i was in florence and i heard she was here so i came
down last week. you’d never know mama’s little girl.’ he
modified the remark, ‘i mean she was so carefully brought
up and now she’s a woman of the world—if you know what
i mean. believe me, has she got some of these roman boys 
308 tender is the night
tied up in bags! and how!’
‘you studying in florence?’
‘me? sure, i’m studying architecture there. i go back
sunday—i’m staying for the races.’
with difficulty dick restrained him from adding the
drink to the account he carried in the bar, like a stock-market
report.

when dick got out of the elevator he followed a tortuous
corridor and turned at length toward a distant voice outside
a lighted door. rosemary was in black pajamas; a luncheon
table was still in the room; she was having coffee.
‘you’re still beautiful,’ he said. ‘a little more beautiful
than ever.’
‘do you want coffee, youngster?’
‘i’m sorry i was so unpresentable this morning.’
‘you didn’t look well—you all right now? want coffee?’
‘no, thanks.’
‘you’re fine again, i was scared this morning. mother’s
coming over next month, if the company stays. she always
asks me if i’ve seen you over here, as if she thought we were
living next door. mother always liked you—she always felt
you were some one i ought to know.’
‘well, i’m glad she still thinks of me.’
‘oh, she does,’ rosemary reassured him. ‘a very great
deal.’
‘i’ve seen you here and there in pictures,’ said dick. ‘once
i had daddy’s girl run off just for myself!’
‘i have a good part in this one if it isn’t cut.’
she crossed behind him, touching his shoulder as she
passed. she phoned for the table to be taken away and settled
in a big chair.
310 tender is the night
‘i was just a little girl when i met you, dick. now i’m a
woman.’
‘i want to hear everything about you.’
‘how is nicole—and lanier and topsy?’
‘they’re fine. they often speak of you—‘
the phone rang. while she answered it dick examined
two novels— one by edna ferber, one by albert mckisco.
the waiter came for the table; bereft of its presence rosemary
seemed more alone in her black pajamas.
‘... i have a caller... . no, not very well. i’ve got to go to the
costumer’s for a long fitting... . no, not now ...’
as though with the disappearance of the table she felt released,
rosemary smiled at dick—that smile as if they two
together had managed to get rid of all the trouble in the
world and were now at peace in their own heaven ...
‘that’s done,’ she said. ‘do you realize i’ve spent the last
hour getting ready for you?’
but again the phone called her. dick got up to change
his hat from the bed to the luggage stand, and in alarm
rosemary put her hand over the mouthpiece of the phone.
‘you’re not going!’
‘no.’
when the communication was over he tried to drag the
afternoon together saying: ‘i expect some nourishment
from people now.’
‘me too,’ rosemary agreed. ‘the man that just phoned
me once knew a second cousin of mine. imagine calling
anybody up for a reason like that!’
now she lowered the lights for love. why else should she 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 311
want to shut off his view of her? he sent his words to her
like letters, as though they left him some time before they
reached her.
‘hard to sit here and be close to you, and not kiss you.’
then they kissed passionately in the centre of the floor. she
pressed against him, and went back to her chair.
it could not go on being merely pleasant in the room.
forward or backward; when the phone rang once more
he strolled into the bedchamber and lay down on her bed,
opening albert mckisco’s novel. presently rosemary came
in and sat beside him.
‘you have the longest eyelashes,’ she remarked.
‘we are now back at the junior prom. among those present
are miss rosemary hoyt, the eyelash fancier—‘
she kissed him and he pulled her down so that they lay
side by side, and then they kissed till they were both breathless.
her breathing was young and eager and exciting. her
lips were faintly chapped but soft in the corners.
when they were still limbs and feet and clothes, struggles
of his arms and back, and her throat and breasts, she
whispered, ‘no, not now—those things are rhythmic.’
disciplined he crushed his passion into a corner of his
mind, but bearing up her fragility on his arms until she was
poised half a foot above him, he said lightly:
‘darling—that doesn’t matter.’
her face had changed with his looking up at it; there was
the eternal moonlight in it.
‘that would be poetic justice if it should be you,’ she
said. she twisted away from him, walked to the mirror, and 
312 tender is the night
boxed her disarranged hair with her hands. presently she
drew a chair close to the bed and stroked his cheek.
‘tell me the truth about you,’ he demanded.
‘i always have.’
‘in a way—but nothing hangs together.’
they both laughed but he pursued.
‘are you actually a virgin?’
‘no-o-o!’ she sang. ‘i’ve slept with six hundred and forty
men—if that’s the answer you want.’
‘it’s none of my business.’
‘do you want me for a case in psychology?’
‘looking at you as a perfectly normal girl of twenty-two,
living in the year nineteen twenty-eight, i guess you’ve taken
a few shots at love.’
‘it’s all been—abortive,’ she said.
dick couldn’t believe her. he could not decide whether
she was deliberately building a barrier between them or
whether this was intended to make an eventual surrender
more significant.
‘let’s go walk in the pincio,’ he suggested.
he shook himself straight in his clothes and smoothed his
hair. a moment had come and somehow passed. for three
years dick had been the ideal by which rosemary measured
other men and inevitably his stature had increased to heroic
size. she did not want him to be like other men, yet
here were the same exigent demands, as if he wanted to take
some of herself away, carry it off in his pocket.
walking on the greensward between cherubs and philosophers,
fauns and falling water, she took his arm snugly, 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 313
settling into it with a series of little readjustments, as if she
wanted it to be right because it was going to be there forever.
she plucked a twig and broke it, but she found no spring in
it. suddenly seeing what she wanted in dick’s face she took
his gloved hand and kissed it. then she cavorted childishly
for him until he smiled and she laughed and they began
having a good time.
‘i can’t go out with you to-night, darling, because i promised
some people a long time ago. but if you’ll get up early
i’ll take you out to the set to-morrow.’
he dined alone at the hotel, went to bed early, and met
rosemary in the lobby at half-past six. beside him in the car
she glowed away fresh and new in the morning sunshine.
they went out through the porta san sebastiano and along
the appian way until they came to the huge set of the forum,
larger than the forum itself. rosemary turned him
over to a man who led him about the great props; the arches
and tiers of seats and the sanded arena. she was working
on a stage which represented a guard-room for christian
prisoners, and presently they went there and watched nicotera,
one of many hopeful valentinos, strut and pose before
a dozen female ‘captives,’ their eyes melancholy and startling
with mascara.
rosemary appeared in a knee-length tunic.
‘watch this,’ she whispered to dick. ‘i want your opinion.
everybody that’s seen the rushes says—‘
‘what are the rushes?’
‘when they run off what they took the day before. they
say it’s the first thing i’ve had sex appeal in.’
314 tender is the night
‘i don’t notice it.’
‘you wouldn’t! but i have.’
nicotera in his leopard skin talked attentively to rosemary
while the electrician discussed something with the
director, meanwhile leaning on him. finally the director
pushed his hand off roughly and wiped a sweating forehead,
and dick’s guide remarked: ‘he’s on the hop again,
and how!’
‘who?’ asked dick, but before the man could answer the
director walked swiftly over to them.
‘who’s on the hop—you’re on the hop yourself.’ he spoke
vehemently to dick, as if to a jury. ‘when he’s on the hop
he always thinks everybody else is, and how!’ he glared at
the guide a moment longer, then he clapped his hands: ‘all
right—everybody on the set.’
it was like visiting a great turbulent family. an actress
approached dick and talked to him for five minutes under
the impression that he was an actor recently arrived from
london. discovering her mistake she scuttled away in panic.
the majority of the company felt either sharply superior
or sharply inferior to the world outside, but the former feeling
prevailed. they were people of bravery and industry;
they were risen to a position of prominence in a nation that
for a decade had wanted only to be entertained.
the session ended as the light grew misty—a fine light
for painters, but, for the camera, not to be compared with
the clear california air. nicotera followed rosemary to the
car and whispered something to her—she looked at him
without smiling as she said good-by.

dick and rosemary had luncheon at the castelli dei
cæsari, a splendid restaurant in a high-terraced villa overlooking
the ruined forum of an undetermined period of the
decadence. rosemary took a cocktail and a little wine, and
dick took enough so that his feeling of dissatisfaction left
him. afterward they drove back to the hotel, all flushed and
happy, in a sort of exalted quiet. she wanted to be taken and
she was, and what had begun with a childish infatuation on
a beach was accomplished at last.
316 tender is the night
xxi
rosemary had another dinner date, a birthday party for
a member of the company. dick ran into collis clay in the
lobby, but he wanted to dine alone, and pretended an engagement
at the excelsior. he drank a cocktail with collis
and his vague dissatisfaction crystallized as impatience—
he no longer had an excuse for playing truant to the clinic.
this was less an infatuation than a romantic memory. nicole
was his girl—too often he was sick at heart about her,
yet she was his girl. time with rosemary was self-indulgence—
time with collis was nothing plus nothing.
in the doorway of the excelsior he ran into baby warren.
her large beautiful eyes, looking precisely like marbles,
stared at him with surprise and curiosity. ‘i thought you
were in america, dick! is nicole with you?’
‘i came back by way of naples.’
the black band on his arm reminded her to say: ‘i’m so
sorry to hear of your trouble.’
inevitably they dined together.
‘tell me about everything,’ she demanded.
dick gave her a version of the facts, and baby frowned.
she found it necessary to blame some one for the catastrophe
in her sister’s life.
‘do you think doctor dohmler took the right course
with her from the first?’

‘there’s not much variety in treatment any more—of
course you try to find the right personality to handle a particular
case.’
‘dick, i don’t pretend to advise you or to know much
about it but don’t you think a change might be good for
her—to get out of that atmosphere of sickness and live in
the world like other people?’
‘but you were keen for the clinic,’ he reminded her. ‘you
told me you’d never feel really safe about her—‘
‘that was when you were leading that hermit’s life on the
riviera, up on a hill way off from anybody. i didn’t mean to
go back to that life. i meant, for instance, london. the english
are the best-balanced race in the world.’
‘they are not,’ he disagreed.
‘they are. i know them, you see. i meant it might be nice
for you to take a house in london for the spring season—i
know a dove of a house in talbot square you could get, furnished.
i mean, living with sane, well-balanced english
people.’
she would have gone on to tell him all the old propaganda
stories of 1914 if he had not laughed and said:
‘i’ve been reading a book by michael arlen and if
that’s—‘
she ruined michael arlen with a wave of her salad
spoon.
‘he only writes about degenerates. i mean the worthwhile
english.’
as she thus dismissed her friends they were replaced in
dick’s mind only by a picture of the alien, unresponsive fac-
318 tender is the night
es that peopled the small hotels of europe.
‘of course it’s none of my business,’ baby repeated, as a
preliminary to a further plunge, ‘but to leave her alone in an
atmosphere like that—‘
‘i went to america because my father died.’
‘i understand that, i told you how sorry i was.’ she fiddled
with the glass grapes on her necklace. ‘but there’s so
much money now. plenty for everything, and it ought to
be used to get nicole well.’
‘for one thing i can’t see myself in london.’
‘why not? i should think you could work there as well as
anywhere else.’
he sat back and looked at her. if she had ever suspected
the rotted old truth, the real reason for nicole’s illness, she
had certainly determined to deny it to herself, shoving it
back in a dusty closet like one of the paintings she bought
by mistake.
they continued the conversation in the ulpia, where
collis clay came over to their table and sat down, and a
gifted guitar player thrummed and rumbled ‘suona fanfara
mia’ in the cellar piled with wine casks.
‘it’s possible that i was the wrong person for nicole,’ dick
said. ‘still she would probably have married some one of
my type, some one she thought she could rely on—indefinitely.’
‘you think she’d be happier with somebody else?’ baby
thought aloud suddenly. ‘of course it could be arranged.’
only as she saw dick bend forward with helpless laughter
did she realize the preposterousness of her remark.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 319
‘oh, you understand,’ she assured him. ‘don’t think for a
moment that we’re not grateful for all you’ve done. and we
know you’ve had a hard time—‘
‘for god’s sake,’ he protested. ‘if i didn’t love nicole it
might be different.’
‘but you do love nicole?’ she demanded in alarm.
collis was catching up with the conversation now and
dick switched it quickly: ‘suppose we talk about something
else—about you, for instance. why don’t you get married?
we heard you were engaged to lord paley, the cousin of
the—‘
‘oh, no.’ she became coy and elusive. ‘that was last
year.’
‘why don’t you marry?’ dick insisted stubbornly.
‘i don’t know. one of the men i loved was killed in the
war, and the other one threw me over.’
‘tell me about it. tell me about your private life, baby,
and your opinions. you never do—we always talk about nicole.’
‘both of them were englishmen. i don’t think there’s any
higher type in the world than a first-rate englishman, do
you? if there is i haven’t met him. this man—oh, it’s a long
story. i hate long stories, don’t you?’
‘and how!’ said collis.
‘why, no—i like them if they’re good.’
‘that’s something you do so well, dick. you can keep a
party moving by just a little sentence or a saying here and
there. i think that’s a wonderful talent.’
‘it’s a trick,’ he said gently. that made three of her opin-
320 tender is the night
ions he disagreed with.
‘of course i like formality—i like things to be just so,
and on the grand scale. i know you probably don’t but you
must admit it’s a sign of solidity in me.’
dick did not even bother to dissent from this.
‘of course i know people say, baby warren is racing
around over europe, chasing one novelty after another, and
missing the best things in life, but i think on the contrary
that i’m one of the few people who really go after the best
things. i’ve known the most interesting people of my time.’
her voice blurred with the tinny drumming of another guitar
number, but she called over it, ‘i’ve made very few big
mistakes—‘
‘—only the very big ones, baby.’
she had caught something facetious in his eye and she
changed the subject. it seemed impossible for them to hold
anything in common. but he admired something in her,
and he deposited her at the excelsior with a series of compliments
that left her shimmering.
rosemary insisted on treating dick to lunch next day.
they went to a little trattoria kept by an italian who had
worked in america, and ate ham and eggs and waffles. afterward,
they went to the hotel. dick’s discovery that he was
not in love with her, nor she with him, had added to rather
than diminished his passion for her. now that he knew he
would not enter further into her life, she became the strange
woman for him. he supposed many men meant no more
than that when they said they were in love—not a wild submergence
of soul, a dipping of all colors into an obscuring 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 321
dye, such as his love for nicole had been. certain thoughts
about nicole, that she should die, sink into mental darkness,
love another man, made him physically sick.
nicotera was in rosemary’s sitting-room, chattering
about a professional matter. when rosemary gave him
his cue to go, he left with humorous protests and a rather
insolent wink at dick. as usual the phone clamored and
rosemary was engaged at it for ten minutes, to dick’s increasing
impatience.
‘let’s go up to my room,’ he suggested, and she agreed.
she lay across his knees on a big sofa; he ran his fingers
through the lovely forelocks of her hair.
‘let me be curious about you again?’ he asked.
‘what do you want to know?’
‘about men. i’m curious, not to say prurient.’
‘you mean how long after i met you?’
‘or before.’
‘oh, no.’ she was shocked. ‘there was nothing before.
you were the first man i cared about. you’re still the only
man i really care about.’ she considered. ‘it was about a year,
i think.’
‘who was it?’
‘oh, a man.’
he closed in on her evasion.
‘i’ll bet i can tell you about it: the first affair was unsatisfactory
and after that there was a long gap. the second was
better, but you hadn’t been in love with the man in the first
place. the third was all right—‘
torturing himself he ran on. ‘then you had one real af-
322 tender is the night
fair that fell of its own weight, and by that time you were
getting afraid that you wouldn’t have anything to give to the
man you finally loved.’ he felt increasingly victorian. ‘afterwards
there were half a dozen just episodic affairs, right
up to the present. is that close?’
she laughed between amusement and tears.
‘it’s about as wrong as it could be,’ she said, to dick’s relief.
‘but some day i’m going to find somebody and love him
and love him and never let him go.’
now his phone rang and dick recognized nicotera’s
voice, asking for rosemary. he put his palm over the transmitter.
‘do you want to talk to him?’
she went to the phone and jabbered in a rapid italian
dick could not understand.
‘this telephoning takes time,’ he said. ‘it’s after four and
i have an engagement at five. you better go play with signor
nicotera.’
‘don’t be silly.’
‘then i think that while i’m here you ought to count him
out.’
‘it’s difficult.’ she was suddenly crying. ‘dick, i do love
you, never anybody like you. but what have you got for
me?’
‘what has nicotera got for anybody?’
‘that’s different.’
—because youth called to youth.
‘he’s a spic!’ he said. he was frantic with jealousy, he
didn’t want to be hurt again.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 323
‘he’s only a baby,’ she said, sniffling. ‘you know i’m yours
first.’
in reaction he put his arms about her but she relaxed wearily
backward; he held her like that for a moment as in the
end of an adagio, her eyes closed, her hair falling straight
back like that of a girl drowned.
‘dick, let me go. i never felt so mixed up in my life.’
he was a gruff red bird and instinctively she drew away
from him as his unjustified jealousy began to snow over the
qualities of consideration and understanding with which
she felt at home.
‘i want to know the truth,’ he said.
‘yes, then. we’re a lot together, he wants to marry me,
but i don’t want to. what of it? what do you expect me to
do? you never asked me to marry you. do you want me to
play around forever with half-wits like collis clay?’
‘you were with nicotera last night?’
‘that’s none of your business,’ she sobbed. ‘excuse me,
dick, it is your business. you and mother are the only two
people in the world i care about.’
‘how about nicotera?’
‘how do i know?’
she had achieved the elusiveness that gives hidden significance
to the least significant remarks.
‘is it like you felt toward me in paris?’
‘i feel comfortable and happy when i’m with you. in paris
it was different. but you never know how you once felt.
do you?’
he got up and began collecting his evening clothes—if he 
324 tender is the night
had to bring all the bitterness and hatred of the world into
his heart, he was not going to be in love with her again.
‘i don’t care about nicotera!’ she declared. ‘but i’ve got
to go to livorno with the company to-morrow. oh, why did
this have to happen?’ there was a new flood of tears. ‘it’s
such a shame. why did you come here? why couldn’t we
just have the memory anyhow? i feel as if i’d quarrelled with
mother.’
as he began to dress, she got up and went to the door.
‘i won’t go to the party to-night.’ it was her last effort. ‘i’ll
stay with you. i don’t want to go anyhow.’
the tide began to flow again, but he retreated from it.
‘i’ll be in my room,’ she said. ‘good-by, dick.’
‘good-by.’
‘oh, such a shame, such a shame. oh, such a shame.
what’s it all about anyhow?’
‘i’ve wondered for a long time.’
‘but why bring it to me?’
‘i guess i’m the black death,’ he said slowly. ‘i don’t seem
to bring people happiness any more.’

there were five people in the quirinal bar after dinner, a
highclass italian frail who sat on a stool making persistent
conversation against the bartender’s bored: ‘si ... si ... si,’ a
light, snobbish egyptian who was lonely but chary of the
woman, and the two americans.
dick was always vividly conscious of his surroundings,
while collis clay lived vaguely, the sharpest impressions
dissolving upon a recording apparatus that had early atrophied,
so the former talked and the latter listened, like a
man sitting in a breeze.
dick, worn away by the events of the afternoon, was taking
it out on the inhabitants of italy. he looked around the
bar as if he hoped an italian had heard him and would resent
his words.
‘this afternoon i had tea with my sister-in-law at the
excelsior. we got the last table and two men came up and
looked around for a table and couldn’t find one. so one of
them came up to us and said, ‘isn’t this table reserved for
the princess orsini?’ and i said: ‘there was no sign on it,’
and he said: ‘but i think it’s reserved for the princess orsini.’
i couldn’t even answer him.’
‘what’d he do?’
‘he retired.’ dick switched around in his chair. ‘i don’t
like these people. the other day i left rosemary for two 
326 tender is the night
minutes in front of a store and an officer started walking up
and down in front of her, tipping his hat.’
‘i don’t know,’ said collis after a moment. ‘i’d rather be
here than up in paris with somebody picking your pocket
every minute.’
he had been enjoying himself, and he held out against
anything that threatened to dull his pleasure.
‘i don’t know,’ he persisted. ‘i don’t mind it here.’
dick evoked the picture that the few days had imprinted
on his mind, and stared at it. the walk toward the american
express past the odorous confectioneries of the via nationale,
through the foul tunnel up to the spanish steps, where
his spirit soared before the flower stalls and the house where
keats had died. he cared only about people; he was scarcely
conscious of places except for their weather, until they had
been invested with color by tangible events. rome was the
end of his dream of rosemary.
a bell-boy came in and gave him a note.
‘i did not go to the party,’ it said. ‘i am in my room. we
leave for livorno early in the morning.’
dick handed the note and a tip to the boy.
‘tell miss hoyt you couldn’t find me.’ turning to collis
he suggested the bonbonieri.
they inspected the tart at the bar, granting her the minimum
of interest exacted by her profession, and she stared
back with bright boldness; they went through the deserted
lobby oppressed by draperies holding victorian dust in
stuffy folds, and they nodded at the night concierge who returned
the gesture with the bitter servility peculiar to night 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 327
servants. then in a taxi they rode along cheerless streets
through a dank november night. there were no women in
the streets, only pale men with dark coats buttoned to the
neck, who stood in groups beside shoulders of cold stone.
‘my god!’ dick sighed.
‘what’s a matter?’
‘i was thinking of that man this afternoon: ‘this table is
reserved for the princess orsini.’ do you know what these
old roman families are? they’re bandits, they’re the ones
who got possession of the temples and palaces after rome
went to pieces and preyed on the people.’
‘i like rome,’ insisted collis. ‘why won’t you try the races?’
‘i don’t like races.’
‘but all the women turn out—‘
‘i know i wouldn’t like anything here. i like france,
where everybody thinks he’s napoleon—down here everybody
thinks he’s christ.’
at the bonbonieri they descended to a panelled cabaret,
hopelessly impermanent amid the cold stone. a listless band
played a tango and a dozen couples covered the wide floor
with those elaborate and dainty steps so offensive to the
american eye. a surplus of waiters precluded the stir and
bustle that even a few busy men can create; over the scene as
its form of animation brooded an air of waiting for something,
for the dance, the night, the balance of forces which
kept it stable, to cease. it assured the impressionable guest
that whatever he was seeking he would not find it here.
this was plain as plain to dick. he looked around, hop-
328 tender is the night
ing his eye would catch on something, so that spirit instead
of imagination could carry on for an hour. but there was
nothing and after a moment he turned back to collis. he
had told collis some of his current notions, and he was
bored with his audience’s short memory and lack of response.
after half an hour of collis he felt a distinct lesion
of his own vitality.
they drank a bottle of italian mousseaux, and dick became
pale and somewhat noisy. he called the orchestra
leader over to their table; this was a bahama negro, conceited
and unpleasant, and in a few minutes there was a row.
‘you asked me to sit down.’
‘all right. and i gave you fifty lire, didn’t i?’
‘all right. all right. all right.’
‘all right, i gave you fifty lire, didn’t i? then you come up
and asked me to put some more in the horn!’
‘you asked me to sit down, didn’t you? didn’t you?’
‘i asked you to sit down but i gave you fifty lire, didn’t
i?’
‘all right. all right.’
the negro got up sourly and went away, leaving dick in a
still more evil humor. but he saw a girl smiling at him from
across the room and immediately the pale roman shapes
around him receded into decent, humble perspective. she
was a young english girl, with blonde hair and a healthy,
pretty english face and she smiled at him again with an invitation
he understood, that denied the flesh even in the act
of tendering it.
‘there’s a quick trick or else i don’t know bridge,’ said 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 329
collis.
dick got up and walked to her across the room.
‘won’t you dance?’
the middle-aged englishman with whom she was sitting
said, almost apologetically: ‘i’m going out soon.’
sobered by excitement dick danced. he found in the
girl a suggestion of all the pleasant english things; the story
of safe gardens ringed around by the sea was implicit
in her bright voice and as he leaned back to look at her, he
meant what he said to her so sincerely that his voice trembled.
when her current escort should leave, she promised
to come and sit with them. the englishman accepted her
return with repeated apologies and smiles.
back at his table dick ordered another bottle of spumante.
‘she looks like somebody in the movies,’ he said. ‘i can’t
think who.’ he glanced impatiently over his shoulder. ‘wonder
what’s keeping her?’
‘i’d like to get in the movies,’ said collis thoughtfully.
‘i’m supposed to go into my father’s business but it doesn’t
appeal to me much. sit in an office in birmingham for twenty
years—‘
his voice resisted the pressure of materialistic civilization.
‘too good for it?’ suggested dick.
‘no, i don’t mean that.’
‘yes, you do.’
‘how do you know what i mean? why don’t you practise
as a doctor, if you like to work so much?’
330 tender is the night
dick had made them both wretched by this time, but
simultaneously they had become vague with drink and in
a moment they forgot; collis left, and they shook hands
warmly.
‘think it over,’ said dick sagely.
‘think what over?’
‘you know.’ it had been something about collis going
into his father’s business—good sound advice.
clay walked off into space. dick finished his bottle and
then danced with the english girl again, conquering his unwilling
body with bold revolutions and stern determined
marches down the floor. the most remarkable thing suddenly
happened. he was dancing with the girl, the music
stopped—and she had disappeared.
‘have you seen her?’
‘seen who?’
‘the girl i was dancing with. su’nly disappeared. must be
in the building.’
‘no! no! that’s the ladies’ room.’
he stood up by the bar. there were two other men there,
but he could think of no way of starting a conversation. he
could have told them all about rome and the violent origins
of the colonna and gaetani families but he realized that
as a beginning that would be somewhat abrupt. a row of
yenci dolls on the cigar counter fell suddenly to the floor;
there was a subsequent confusion and he had a sense of having
been the cause of it, so he went back to the cabaret and
drank a cup of black coffee. collis was gone and the english
girl was gone and there seemed nothing to do but go back 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 331
to the hotel and lie down with his black heart. he paid his
check and got his hat and coat.
there was dirty water in the gutters and between the
rough cobblestones; a marshy vapor from the campagna, a
sweat of exhausted cultures tainted the morning air. a quartet
of taxidrivers, their little eyes bobbing in dark pouches,
surrounded him. one who leaned insistently in his face he
pushed harshly away.
‘quanto a hotel quirinal?’
‘cento lire.’
six dollars. he shook his head and offered thirty lire
which was twice the day-time fare, but they shrugged their
shoulders as one pair, and moved off.
‘trente-cinque lire e mancie,’ he said firmly.
‘cento lire.’
he broke into english.
‘to go half a mile? you’ll take me for forty lire.’
‘oh, no.’
he was very tired. he pulled open the door of a cab and
got in.
‘hotel quirinal!’ he said to the driver who stood obstinately
outside the window. ‘wipe that sneer off your face
and take me to the quirinal.’
‘ah, no.’
dick got out. by the door of the bonbonieri some one
was arguing with the taxi-drivers, some one who now tried
to explain their attitude to dick; again one of the men
pressed close, insisting and gesticulating and dick shoved
him away.
332 tender is the night
‘i want to go to the quirinal hotel.’
‘he says wan huner lire,’ explained the interpreter.
‘i understand. i’ll give him fif’y lire. go on away.’ this
last to the insistent man who had edged up once more. the
man looked at him and spat contemptuously.
the passionate impatience of the week leaped up in dick
and clothed itself like a flash in violence, the honorable, the
traditional resource of his land; he stepped forward and
slapped the man’s face.
they surged about him, threatening, waving their arms,
trying ineffectually to close in on him—with his back against
the wall dick hit out clumsily, laughing a little and for a few
minutes the mock fight, an affair of foiled rushes and padded,
glancing blows, swayed back and forth in front of the
door. then dick tripped and fell; he was hurt somewhere
but he struggled up again wrestling in arms that suddenly
broke apart. there was a new voice and a new argument but
he leaned against the wall, panting and furious at the indignity
of his position. he saw there was no sympathy for him
but he was unable to believe that he was wrong.
they were going to the police station and settle it there.
his hat was retrieved and handed to him, and with some
one holding his arm lightly he strode around the corner
with the taxi-men and entered a bare barrack where carabinieri
lounged under a single dim light.
at a desk sat a captain, to whom the officious individual
who had stopped the battle spoke at length in italian, at
times pointing at dick, and letting himself be interrupted
by the taxi-men who delivered short bursts of invective and 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 333
denunciation. the captain began to nod impatiently. he
held up his hand and the hydra-headed address, with a few
parting exclamations, died away. then he turned to dick.
‘spick italiano?’ he asked.
‘no.’
‘spick français?’
‘oui,’ said dick, glowering.
‘alors. écoute. va au quirinal. espèce d’endormi. écoute:
vous êtes saoûl. payez ce que le chauffeur demande. comprenez-vous?’
diver shook his head.
‘non, je ne veux pas.’
‘come?’
‘je paierai quarante lires. c’est bien assez.’
the captain stood up.
‘écoute!’ he cried portentously. ‘vous êtes saoûl. vous
avez battu le chauffeur. comme ci, comme ça.’ he struck
the air excitedly with right hand and left, ‘c’est bon que je
vous donne la liberté. payez ce qu’il a dit—cento lire. va au
quirinal.’
raging with humiliation, dick stared back at him.
‘all right.’ he turned blindly to the door—before him,
leering and nodding, was the man who had brought him to
the police station. ‘i’ll go home,’ he shouted, ‘but first i’ll fix
this baby.’
he walked past the staring carabinieri and up to the
grinning face, hit it with a smashing left beside the jaw. the
man dropped to the floor.
for a moment he stood over him in savage triumph—but 
334 tender is the night
even as a first pang of doubt shot through him the world
reeled; he was clubbed down, and fists and boots beat on
him in a savage tattoo. he felt his nose break like a shingle
and his eyes jerk as if they had snapped back on a rubber
band into his head. a rib splintered under a stamping
heel. momentarily he lost consciousness, regained it as he
was raised to a sitting position and his wrists jerked together
with handcuffs. he struggled automatically. the
plainclothes lieutenant whom he had knocked down, stood
dabbing his jaw with a handkerchief and looking into it for
blood; he came over to dick, poised himself, drew back his
arm and smashed him to the floor.
when doctor diver lay quite still a pail of water was
sloshed over him. one of his eyes opened dimly as he was
being dragged along by the wrists through a bloody haze
and he made out the human and ghastly face of one of the
taxi-drivers.
‘go to the excelsior hotel,’ he cried faintly. ‘tell miss
warren. two hundred lire! miss warren. due centi lire! oh,
you dirty— you god—‘
still he was dragged along through the bloody haze,
choking and sobbing, over vague irregular surfaces into
some small place where he was dropped upon a stone floor.
the men went out, a door clanged, he was alone.

until one o’clock baby warren lay in bed, reading one
of marion crawford’s curiously inanimate roman stories;
then she went to a window and looked down into the street.
across from the hotel two carabinieri, grotesque in swaddling
capes and harlequin hats, swung voluminously from
this side and that, like mains’ls coming about, and watching
them she thought of the guards’ officer who had stared
at her so intensely at lunch. he had possessed the arrogance
of a tall member of a short race, with no obligation save
to be tall. had he come up to her and said: ‘let’s go along,
you and i,’ she would have answered: ‘why not?’—at least it
seemed so now, for she was still disembodied by an unfamiliar
background.
her thoughts drifted back slowly through the guardsman
to the two carabinieri, to dick—she got into bed and
turned out the light.
a little before four she was awakened by a brusque
knocking.
‘yes—what is it?’
‘it’s the concierge, madame.’
she pulled on her kimono and faced him sleepily.
‘your friend name deever he’s in trouble. he had trouble
with the police, and they have him in the jail. he sent a taxi
up to tell, the driver says that he promised him two hun-
336 tender is the night
dred lire.’ he paused cautiously for this to be approved. ‘the
driver says mr. deever in the bad trouble. he had a fight
with the police and is terribly bad hurt.’
‘i’ll be right down.’
she dressed to an accompaniment of anxious heartbeats
and ten minutes later stepped out of the elevator into the
dark lobby. the chauffeur who brought the message was
gone; the concierge hailed another one and told him the
location of the jail. as they rode, the darkness lifted and
thinned outside and baby’s nerves, scarcely awake, cringed
faintly at the unstable balance between night and day. she
began to race against the day; sometimes on the broad avenues
she gained but whenever the thing that was pushing up
paused for a moment, gusts of wind blew here and there impatiently
and the slow creep of light began once more. the
cab went past a loud fountain splashing in a voluminous
shadow, turned into an alley so curved that the buildings
were warped and strained following it, bumped and rattled
over cobblestones, and stopped with a jerk where two sentry
boxes were bright against a wall of green damp. suddenly
from the violet darkness of an archway came dick’s voice,
shouting and screaming.
‘are there any english? are there any americans? are
there any english? are there any—oh, my god! you dirty
wops!’
his voice died away and she heard a dull sound of beating
on the door. then the voice began again.
‘are there any americans? are there any english?’
following the voice she ran through the arch into a

court, whirled about in momentary confusion and located
the small guard-room whence the cries came. two carabinieri
started to their feet, but baby brushed past them to the
door of the cell.
‘dick!’ she called. ‘what’s the trouble?’
‘they’ve put out my eye,’ he cried. ‘they handcuffed me
and then they beat me, the goddamn—the—‘
flashing around baby took a step toward the two carabinieri.
‘what have you done to him?’ she whispered so fiercely
that they flinched before her gathering fury.
‘non capisco inglese.’
in french she execrated them; her wild, confident rage
filled the room, enveloped them until they shrank and
wriggled from the garments of blame with which she invested
them. ‘do something! do something!’
‘we can do nothing until we are ordered.’
‘bene. bay-nay! bene!’
once more baby let her passion scorch around them
until they sweated out apologies for their impotence, looking
at each other with the sense that something had after
all gone terribly wrong. baby went to the cell door, leaned
against it, almost caressing it, as if that could make dick feel
her presence and power, and cried: ‘i’m going to the embassy,
i’ll be back.’ throwing a last glance of infinite menace at
the carabinieri she ran out.
she drove to the american embassy where she paid off
the taxidriver upon his insistence. it was still dark when
she ran up the steps and pressed the bell. she had pressed it 
338 tender is the night
three times before a sleepy english porter opened the door
to her.
‘i want to see some one,’ she said. ‘any one—but right
away.’
‘no one’s awake, madame. we don’t open until nine
o’clock.’
impatiently she waved the hour away.
‘this is important. a man—an american has been terribly
beaten. he’s in an italian jail.’
‘no one’s awake now. at nine o’clock—‘
‘i can’t wait. they’ve put out a man’s eye—my brother-inlaw,
and they won’t let him out of jail. i must talk to some
one—can’t you see? are you crazy? are you an idiot, you
stand there with that look in your face?’
‘hime unable to do anything, madame.’
‘you’ve got to wake some one up!’ she seized him by the
shoulders and jerked him violently. ‘it’s a matter of life and
death. if you won’t wake some one a terrible thing will happen
to you—‘
‘kindly don’t lay hands on me, madame.’
from above and behind the porter floated down a weary
groton voice.
‘what is it there?’
the porter answered with relief.
‘it’s a lady, sir, and she has shook me.’ he had stepped
back to speak and baby pushed forward into the hall. on
an upper landing, just aroused from sleep and wrapped in
a white embroidered persian robe, stood a singular young
man. his face was of a monstrous and unnatural pink, vivid 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 339
yet dead, and over his mouth was fastened what appeared to
be a gag. when he saw baby he moved his head back into a
shadow.
‘what is it?’ he repeated.
baby told him, in her agitation edging forward to the
stairs. in the course of her story she realized that the gag
was in reality a mustache bandage and that the man’s face
was covered with pink cold cream, but the fact fitted quietly
into the nightmare. the thing to do, she cried passionately,
was for him to come to the jail with her at once and get dick
out.
‘it’s a bad business,’ he said.
‘yes,’ she agreed conciliatingly. ‘yes?’
‘this trying to fight the police.’ a note of personal affront
crept into his voice, ‘i’m afraid there’s nothing to be done
until nine o’clock.’
‘till nine o’clock,’ she repeated aghast. ‘but you can do
something, certainly! you can come to the jail with me and
see that they don’t hurt him any more.’
‘we aren’t permitted to do anything like that. the consulate
handles these things. the consulate will be open at
nine.’
his face, constrained to impassivity by the binding strap,
infuriated baby.
‘i can’t wait until nine. my brother-in-law says they’ve
put his eye out—he’s seriously hurt! i have to get to him. i
have to find a doctor.’ she let herself go and began to cry angrily
as she talked, for she knew that he would respond to
her agitation rather than her words. ‘you’ve got to do some-
340 tender is the night
thing about this. it’s your business to protect american
citizens in trouble.’
but he was of the eastern seaboard and too hard for her.
shaking his head patiently at her failure to understand his
position he drew the persian robe closer about him and
came down a few steps.
‘write down the address of the consulate for this lady,’
he said to the porter, ‘and look up doctor colazzo’s address
and telephone number and write that down too.’ he turned
to baby, with the expression of an exasperated christ. ‘my
dear lady, the diplomatic corps represents the government of
the united states to the government of italy. it has nothing
to do with the protection of citizens, except under specific
instructions from the state department. your brother-inlaw
has broken the laws of this country and been put in jail,
just as an italian might be put in jail in new york. the only
people who can let him go are the italian courts and if your
brother-in-law has a case you can get aid and advice from
the consulate, which protects the rights of american citizens.
the consulate does not open until nine o’clock. even if
it were my brother i couldn’t do anything—‘
‘can you phone the consulate?’ she broke in.
‘we can’t interfere with the consulate. when the consul
gets there at nine—‘
‘can you give me his home address?’
after a fractional pause the man shook his head. he took
the memorandum from the porter and gave it to her.
‘now i’ll ask you to excuse me.’
he had manoeuvred her to the door: for an instant the

violet dawn fell shrilly upon his pink mask and upon the
linen sack that supported his mustache; then baby was
standing on the front steps alone. she had been in the embassy
ten minutes.
the piazza whereon it faced was empty save for an old
man gathering cigarette butts with a spiked stick. baby
caught a taxi presently and went to the consulate but there
was no one there save a trio of wretched women scrubbing
the stairs. she could not make them understand that she
wanted the consul’s home address—in a sudden resurgence
of anxiety she rushed out and told the chauffeur to take her
to the jail. he did not know where it was, but by the use of
the words semper dritte, dextra and sinestra she manoeuvred
him to its approximate locality, where she dismounted
and explored a labyrinth of familiar alleys. but the buildings
and the alleys all looked alike. emerging from one trail
into the piazzo d’espagna she saw the american express
company and her heart lifted at the word ‘american’ on the
sign. there was a light in the window and hurrying across
the square she tried the door, but it was locked, and inside
the clock stood at seven. then she thought of collis clay.
she remembered the name of his hotel, a stuffy villa
sealed in red plush across from the excelsior. the woman
on duty at the office was not disposed to help her—she had
no authority to disturb mr. clay, and refused to let miss
warren go up to his room alone; convinced finally that this
was not an affair of passion she accompanied her.
collis lay naked upon his bed. he had come in tight and,
awakening, it took him some moments to realize his nudity. 
342 tender is the night
he atoned for it by an excess of modesty. taking his clothes
into the bathroom he dressed in haste, muttering to himself
‘gosh. she certainly musta got a good look at me.’ after
some telephoning, he and baby found the jail and went to
it.
the cell door was open and dick was slumped on a chair
in the guard-room. the carabinieri had washed some of the
blood from his face, brushed him and set his hat concealingly
upon his head.
baby stood in the doorway trembling.
‘mr. clay will stay with you,’ she said. ‘i want to get the
consul and a doctor.’
‘all right.’
‘just stay quiet.’
‘all right.’
‘i’ll be back.’
she drove to the consulate; it was after eight now, and
she was permitted to sit in the ante-room. toward nine the
consul came in and baby, hysterical with impotence and
exhaustion, repeated her story. the consul was disturbed.
he warned her against getting into brawls in strange cities,
but he was chiefly concerned that she should wait outside—
with despair she read in his elderly eye that he wanted to be
mixed up as little as possible in this catastrophe. waiting on
his action, she passed the minutes by phoning a doctor to go
to dick. there were other people in the ante-room and several
were admitted to the consul’s office. after half an hour
she chose the moment of some one’s coming out and pushed
past the secretary into the room.

‘this is outrageous! an american has been beaten half
to death and thrown into prison and you make no move to
help.’
‘just a minute, mrs—‘
‘i’ve waited long enough. you come right down to the jail
and get him out!’
‘mrs—‘
‘we’re people of considerable standing in america—‘
her mouth hardened as she continued. ‘if it wasn’t for the
scandal we can—i shall see that your indifference to this
matter is reported in the proper quarter. if my brother-inlaw
were a british citizen he’d have been free hours ago, but
you’re more concerned with what the police will think than
about what you’re here for.’
‘mrs.—‘
‘you put on your hat and come with me right away.’
the mention of his hat alarmed the consul who began to
clean his spectacles hurriedly and to ruffle his papers. this
proved of no avail: the american woman, aroused, stood
over him; the cleansweeping irrational temper that had broken
the moral back of a race and made a nursery out of a
continent, was too much for him. he rang for the vice-consul—baby
had won.
dick sat in the sunshine that fell profusely through the
guard-room window. collis was with him and two carabinieri,
and they were waiting for something to happen. with
the narrowed vision of his one eye dick could see the carabinieri;
they were tuscan peasants with short upper lips and
he found it difficult to associate them with the brutality of 
344 tender is the night
last night. he sent one of them to fetch him a glass of beer.
the beer made him light-headed and the episode was
momentarily illumined by a ray of sardonic humor. collis
was under the impression that the english girl had something
to do with the catastrophe, but dick was sure she had
disappeared long before it happened. collis was still absorbed
by the fact that miss warren had found him naked
on his bed.
dick’s rage had retreated into him a little and he felt a
vast criminal irresponsibility. what had happened to him
was so awful that nothing could make any difference unless
he could choke it to death, and, as this was unlikely, he was
hopeless. he would be a different person henceforward, and
in his raw state he had bizarre feelings of what the new self
would be. the matter had about it the impersonal quality
of an act of god. no mature aryan is able to profit by a humiliation;
when he forgives it has become part of his life, he
has identified himself with the thing which has humiliated
him—an upshot that in this case was impossible.
when collis spoke of retribution, dick shook his head
and was silent. a lieutenant of carabinieri, pressed, burnished,
vital, came into the room like three men and the
guards jumped to attention. he seized the empty beer bottle
and directed a stream of scolding at his men. the new spirit
was in him, and the first thing was to get the beer bottle out
of the guard-room. dick looked at collis and laughed.
the vice-consul, an over-worked young man named
swanson, arrived, and they started to the court; collis and
swanson on either side of dick and the two carabinieri close

behind. it was a yellow, hazy morning; the squares and arcades
were crowded and dick, pulling his hat low over his
head, walked fast, setting the pace, until one of the shortlegged
carabinieri ran alongside and protested. swanson
arranged matters.
‘i’ve disgraced you, haven’t i?’ said dick jovially.
‘you’re liable to get killed fighting italians,’ replied swanson
sheepishly. ‘they’ll probably let you go this time but if
you were an italian you’d get a couple of months in prison.
and how!’
‘have you ever been in prison?’
swanson laughed.
‘i like him,’ announced dick to clay. ‘he’s a very likeable
young man and he gives people excellent advice, but
i’ll bet he’s been to jail himself. probably spent weeks at a
time in jail.’
swanson laughed.
‘i mean you want to be careful. you don’t know how
these people are.’
‘oh, i know how they are,’ broke out dick, irritably.
‘they’re god damn stinkers.’ he turned around to the carabinieri:
‘did you get that?’
‘i’m leaving you here,’ swanson said quickly. ‘i told your
sisterin-law i would—our lawyer will meet you upstairs in
the courtroom. you want to be careful.’
‘good-by.’ dick shook hands politely. ‘thank you very
much. i feel you have a future—‘
with another smile swanson hurried away, resuming his
official expression of disapproval.
346 tender is the night
now they came into a courtyard on all four sides of
which outer stairways mounted to the chambers above. as
they crossed the flags a groaning, hissing, booing sound
went up from the loiterers in the courtyard, voices full of
fury and scorn. dick stared about.
‘what’s that?’ he demanded, aghast.
one of the carabinieri spoke to a group of men and the
sound died away.
they came into the court-room. a shabby italian lawyer
from the consulate spoke at length to the judge while dick
and collis waited aside. some one who knew english turned
from the window that gave on the yard and explained the
sound that had accompanied their passage through. a native
of frascati had raped and slain a fiveyear-old child and
was to be brought in that morning—the crowd had assumed
it was dick.
in a few minutes the lawyer told dick that he was freed—
the court considered him punished enough.
‘enough!’ dick cried. ‘punished for what?’
‘come along,’ said collis. ‘you can’t do anything now.’
‘but what did i do, except get into a fight with some taximen?’
‘they claim you went up to a detective as if you were going
to shake hands with him and hit him—‘
‘that’s not true! i told him i was going to hit him—i
didn’t know he was a detective.’
‘you better go along,’ urged the lawyer.
‘come along.’ collis took his arm and they descended
the steps.

‘i want to make a speech,’ dick cried. ‘i want to explain
to these people how i raped a five-year-old girl. maybe i
did—‘
‘come along.’
baby was waiting with a doctor in a taxi-cab. dick did
not want to look at her and he disliked the doctor, whose
stern manner revealed him as one of that least palpable of
european types, the latin moralist. dick summed up his
conception of the disaster, but no one had much to say. in
his room in the quirinal the doctor washed off the rest of
the blood and the oily sweat, set his nose, his fractured ribs
and fingers, disinfected the smaller wounds and put a hopeful
dressing on the eye. dick asked for a quarter of a grain
of morphine, for he was still wide awake and full of nervous
energy. with the morphine he fell asleep; the doctor and
collis left and baby waited with him until a woman could
arrive from the english nursing home. it had been a hard
night but she had the satisfaction of feeling that, whatever
dick’s previous record was, they now possessed a moral superiority
over him for as long as he proved of any use.

i
frau kaethe gregorovius overtook her husband on the
path of their villa.
‘how was nicole?’ she asked mildly; but she spoke out of
breath, giving away the fact that she had held the question
in her mind during her run.
franz looked at her in surprise.
‘nicole’s not sick. what makes you ask, dearest one?’
‘you see her so much—i thought she must be sick.’
‘we will talk of this in the house.’
kaethe agreed meekly. his study was over in the administration
building and the children were with their tutor in
the living-room; they went up to the bedroom.
‘excuse me, franz,’ said kaethe before he could speak.
‘excuse me, dear, i had no right to say that. i know my obligations
and i am proud of them. but there is a bad feeling
between nicole and me.’
‘birds in their little nests agree,’ franz thundered. finding
the tone inappropriate to the sentiment he repeated his
command in the spaced and considered rhythm with which
his old master, doctor dohmler, could cast significance on
the tritest platitude. ‘birds— in—their—nests—agree!’
‘i realize that. you haven’t seen me fail in courtesy toward
nicole.’
‘i see you failing in common sense. nicole is half a pa-
350 tender is the night
tient—she will possibly remain something of a patient all
her life. in the absence of dick i am responsible.’ he hesitated;
sometimes as a quiet joke he tried to keep news from
kaethe. ‘there was a cable from rome this morning. dick
has had grippe and is starting home to-morrow.’
relieved, kaethe pursued her course in a less personal
tone:
‘i think nicole is less sick than any one thinks—she only
cherishes her illness as an instrument of power. she ought
to be in the cinema, like your norma talmadge—that’s
where all american women would be happy.’
‘are you jealous of norma talmadge, on a film?’
‘i don’t like americans. they’re selfish, self-ish!’
‘you like dick?’
‘i like him,’ she admitted. ‘he’s different, he thinks of
others.’
—and so does norma talmadge, franz said to himself.
norma talmadge must be a fine, noble woman beyond her
loveliness. they must compel her to play foolish rôles; norma
talmadge must be a woman whom it would be a great
privilege to know.
kaethe had forgotten about norma talmadge, a vivid
shadow that she had fretted bitterly upon one night as they
were driving home from the movies in zurich.
‘—dick married nicole for her money,’ she said. ‘that
was his weakness—you hinted as much yourself one night.’
‘you’re being malicious.’
‘i shouldn’t have said that,’ she retracted. ‘we must all
live together like birds, as you say. but it’s difficult when ni-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 351
cole acts as—when nicole pulls herself back a little, as if she
were holding her breath—as if i smelt bad!’
kaethe had touched a material truth. she did most of her
work herself, and, frugal, she bought few clothes. an american
shopgirl, laundering two changes of underwear every
night, would have noticed a hint of yesterday’s reawakened
sweat about kaethe’s person, less a smell than an ammoniacal
reminder of the eternity of toil and decay. to franz this
was as natural as the thick dark scent of kaethe’s hair, and
he would have missed it equally; but to nicole, born hating
the smell of a nurse’s fingers dressing her, it was an offense
only to be endured.
‘and the children,’ kaethe continued. ‘she doesn’t like
them to play with our children—‘ but franz had heard
enough:
‘hold your tongue—that kind of talk can hurt me professionally,
since we owe this clinic to nicole’s money. let
us have lunch.’
kaethe realized that her outburst had been ill-advised,
but franz’s last remark reminded her that other americans
had money, and a week later she put her dislike of nicole
into new words.
the occasion was the dinner they tendered the divers
upon dick’s return. hardly had their footfalls ceased on the
path when she shut the door and said to franz:
‘did you see around his eyes? he’s been on a debauch!’
‘go gently,’ franz requested. ‘dick told me about that as
soon as he came home. he was boxing on the trans-atlantic
ship. the american passengers box a lot on these trans-at-
352 tender is the night
lantic ships.’
‘i believe that?’ she scoffed. ‘it hurts him to move one of
his arms and he has an unhealed scar on his temple—you
can see where the hair’s been cut away.’
franz had not noticed these details.
‘but what?’ kaethe demanded. ‘do you think that sort of
thing does the clinic any good? the liquor i smelt on him
tonight, and several other times since he’s been back.’
she slowed her voice to fit the gravity of what she was
about to say: ‘dick is no longer a serious man.’
franz rocked his shoulders up the stairs, shaking off her
persistence. in their bedroom he turned on her.
‘he is most certainly a serious man and a brilliant man.
of all the men who have recently taken their degrees in
neuropathology in zurich, dick has been regarded as the
most brilliant—more brilliant than i could ever be.’
‘for shame!’
‘it’s the truth—the shame would be not to admit it. i
turn to dick when cases are highly involved. his publications
are still standard in their line—go into any medical
library and ask. most students think he’s an englishman—
they don’t believe that such thoroughness could come out
of america.’ he groaned domestically, taking his pajamas
from under the pillow, ‘i can’t understand why you talk this
way, kaethe—i thought you liked him.’
‘for shame!’ kaethe said. ‘you’re the solid one, you do
the work. it’s a case of hare and tortoise—and in my opinion
the hare’s race is almost done.’
‘tch! tch!’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 353
‘very well, then. it’s true.’
with his open hand he pushed down air briskly.
‘stop!’
the upshot was that they had exchanged viewpoints like
debaters. kaethe admitted to herself that she had been too
hard on dick, whom she admired and of whom she stood
in awe, who had been so appreciative and understanding
of herself. as for franz, once kaethe’s idea had had time to
sink in, he never after believed that dick was a serious person.
and as time went on he convinced himself that he had
never thought so.
354 tender is the night
ii
dick told nicole an expurgated version of the catastrophe
in rome— in his version he had gone philanthropically
to the rescue of a drunken friend. he could trust baby warren
to hold her tongue, since he had painted the disastrous
effect of the truth upon nicole. all this, however, was a low
hurdle compared to the lingering effect of the episode upon
him.
in reaction he took himself for an intensified beating in
his work, so that franz, trying to break with him, could find
no basis on which to begin a disagreement. no friendship
worth the name was ever destroyed in an hour without some
painful flesh being torn—so franz let himself believe with
ever-increasing conviction that dick travelled intellectually
and emotionally at such a rate of speed that the vibrations
jarred him—this was a contrast that had previously been
considered a virtue in their relation. so, for the shoddiness
of needs, are shoes made out of last year’s hide.
yet it was may before franz found an opportunity to
insert the first wedge. dick came into his office white and
tired one noon and sat down, saying:
‘well, she’s gone.’
‘she’s dead?’
‘the heart quit.’
dick sat exhausted in the chair nearest the door. during 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 355
three nights he had remained with the scabbed anonymous
woman-artist he had come to love, formally to portion out
the adrenaline, but really to throw as much wan light as he
could into the darkness ahead.
half appreciating his feeling, franz travelled quickly
over an opinion:
‘it was neuro-syphilis. all the wassermans we took won’t
tell me differently. the spinal fluid—‘
‘never mind,’ said dick. ‘oh, god, never mind! if she
cared enough about her secret to take it away with her, let
it go at that.’
‘you better lay off for a day.’
‘don’t worry, i’m going to.’
franz had his wedge; looking up from the telegram that
he was writing to the woman’s brother he inquired: ‘or do
you want to take a little trip?’
‘not now.’
‘i don’t mean a vacation. there’s a case in lausanne. i’ve
been on the phone with a chilian all morning—‘
‘she was so damn brave,’ said dick. ‘and it took her so
long.’ franz shook his head sympathetically and dick got
himself together. ‘excuse me for interrupting you.’
‘this is just a change—the situation is a father’s problem
with his son—the father can’t get the son up here. he wants
somebody to come down there.’
‘what is it? alcoholism? homosexuality? when you say
lausanne—‘
‘a little of everything.’
‘i’ll go down. is there any money in it?’
356 tender is the night
‘quite a lot, i’d say. count on staying two or three days,
and get the boy up here if he needs to be watched. in any
case take your time, take your ease; combine business with
pleasure.’
after two hours’ train sleep dick felt renewed, and he
approached the interview with señor pardo y cuidad real
in good spirits.
these interviews were much of a type. often the sheer
hysteria of the family representative was as interesting psychologically
as the condition of the patient. this one was no
exception: señor pardo y cuidad real, a handsome irongray
spaniard, noble of carriage, with all the appurtenances
of wealth and power, raged up and down his suite in the
hôtel de trois mondes and told the story of his son with no
more self-control than a drunken woman.
‘i am at the end of my invention. my son is corrupt. he
was corrupt at harrow, he was corrupt at king’s college,
cambridge. he’s incorrigibly corrupt. now that there is this
drinking it is more and more obvious how he is, and there
is continual scandal. i have tried everything—i worked out
a plan with a doctor friend of mine, sent them together for
a tour of spain. every evening francisco had an injection of
cantharides and then the two went together to a reputable
bordello—for a week or so it seemed to work but the result
was nothing. finally last week in this very room, rather in
that bathroom—‘ he pointed at it, ‘—i made francisco strip
to the waist and lashed him with a whip—‘
exhausted with his emotion he sat down and dick
spoke:
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 357
‘that was foolish—the trip to spain was futile also—‘ he
struggled against an upsurging hilarity—that any reputable
medical man should have lent himself to such an amateurish
experiment! ‘—señor, i must tell you that in these cases
we can promise nothing. in the case of the drinking we can
often accomplish something—with proper co-operation.
the first thing is to see the boy and get enough of his confidence
to find whether he has any insight into the matter.’
—the boy, with whom he sat on the terrace, was about
twenty, handsome and alert.
‘i’d like to know your attitude,’ dick said. ‘do you feel
that the situation is getting worse? and do you want to do
anything about it?’
‘i suppose i do,’ said francisco, ‘i am very unhappy.’
‘do you think it’s from the drinking or from the abnormality?’
‘i think the drinking is caused by the other.’ he was
serious for a while—suddenly an irrepressible facetiousness
broke through and he laughed, saying, ‘it’s hopeless.
at king’s i was known as the queen of chili. that trip to
spain—all it did was to make me nauseated by the sight of
a woman.’
dick caught him up sharply.
‘if you’re happy in this mess, then i can’t help you and
i’m wasting my time.’
‘no, let’s talk—i despise most of the others so.’ there was
some manliness in the boy, perverted now into an active
resistance to his father. but he had that typically roguish
look in his eyes that homosexuals assume in discussing the 
358 tender is the night
subject.
‘it’s a hole-and-corner business at best,’ dick told him.
‘you’ll spend your life on it, and its consequences, and you
won’t have time or energy for any other decent or social act.
if you want to face the world you’ll have to begin by controlling
your sensuality— and, first of all, the drinking that
provokes it—‘
he talked automatically, having abandoned the case ten
minutes before. they talked pleasantly through another
hour about the boy’s home in chili and about his ambitions.
it was as close as dick had ever come to comprehending
such a character from any but the pathological angle—he
gathered that this very charm made it possible for francisco
to perpetrate his outrages, and, for dick, charm always had
an independent existence, whether it was the mad gallantry
of the wretch who had died in the clinic this morning, or
the courageous grace which this lost young man brought
to a drab old story. dick tried to dissect it into pieces small
enough to store away—realizing that the totality of a life may
be different in quality from its segments, and also that life
during the forties seemed capable of being observed only in
segments. his love for nicole and rosemary, his friendship
with abe north, with tommy barban in the broken universe
of the war’s ending—in such contacts the personalities
had seemed to press up so close to him that he became the
personality itself—there seemed some necessity of taking
all or nothing; it was as if for the remainder of his life he
was condemned to carry with him the egos of certain people,
early met and early loved, and to be only as complete as

they were complete themselves. there was some element of
loneliness involved—so easy to be loved—so hard to love.
as he sat on the veranda with young francisco, a ghost
of the past swam into his ken. a tall, singularly swaying
male detached himself from the shrubbery and approached
dick and francisco with feeble resolution. for a moment
he formed such an apologetic part of the vibrant landscape
that dick scarcely remarked him—then dick was on his
feet, shaking hands with an abstracted air, thinking, ‘my
god, i’ve stirred up a nest!’ and trying to collect the man’s
name.
‘this is doctor diver, isn’t it?’
‘well, well—mr. dumphry, isn’t it?’
‘royal dumphry. i had the pleasure of having dinner one
night in that lovely garden of yours.’
‘of course.’ trying to dampen mr. dumphry’s enthusiasm,
dick went into impersonal chronology. ‘it was in
nineteen—twenty-four—or twenty-five—‘
he had remained standing, but royal dumphry, shy as
he had seemed at first, was no laggard with his pick and
spade; he spoke to francisco in a flip, intimate manner, but
the latter, ashamed of him, joined dick in trying to freeze
him away.
‘doctor diver—one thing i want to say before you go.
i’ve never forgotten that evening in your garden—how nice
you and your wife were. to me it’s one of the finest memories
in my life, one of the happiest ones. i’ve always thought
of it as the most civilized gathering of people that i have
ever known.’
360 tender is the night
dick continued a crab-like retreat toward the nearest
door of the hotel.
‘i’m glad you remembered it so pleasantly. now i’ve got
to see—‘
‘i understand,’ royal dumphry pursued sympathetically.
‘i hear he’s dying.’
‘who’s dying?’
‘perhaps i shouldn’t have said that—but we have the
same physician.’
dick paused, regarding him in astonishment. ‘who’re
you talking about?’
‘why, your wife’s father—perhaps i—‘
‘my what?’
‘i suppose—you mean i’m the first person—‘
‘you mean my wife’s father is here, in lausanne?’
‘why, i thought you knew—i thought that was why you
were here.’
‘what doctor is taking care of him?’
dick scrawled the name in a notebook, excused himself,
and hurried to a telephone booth.
it was convenient for doctor dangeu to see doctor diver
at his house immediately.
doctor dangeu was a young génevois; for a moment
he was afraid that he was going to lose a profitable patient,
but, when dick reassured him, he divulged the fact that mr.
warren was indeed dying.
‘he is only fifty but the liver has stopped restoring itself;
the precipitating factor is alcoholism.’
‘doesn’t respond?’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 361
‘the man can take nothing except liquids—i give him
three days, or at most, a week.’
‘does his elder daughter, miss warren, know his condition?’
‘by his own wish no one knows except the man-servant.
it was only this morning i felt i had to tell him—he took it
excitedly, although he has been in a very religious and resigned
mood from the beginning of his illness.’
dick considered: ‘well—‘ he decided slowly, ‘in any case
i’ll take care of the family angle. but i imagine they would
want a consultation.’
‘as you like.’
‘i know i speak for them when i ask you to call in one of
the bestknown medicine men around the lake—herbrugge,
from geneva.’
‘i was thinking of herbrugge.’
‘meanwhile i’m here for a day at least and i’ll keep in
touch with you.’
that evening dick went to señor pardo y cuidad real
and they talked.
‘we have large estates in chili—‘ said the old man. ‘my
son could well be taking care of them. or i can get him in
any one of a dozen enterprises in paris—‘ he shook his
head and paced across the windows against a spring rain
so cheerful that it didn’t even drive the swans to cover, ‘my
only son! can’t you take him with you?’
the spaniard knelt suddenly at dick’s feet.
‘can’t you cure my only son? i believe in you—you can
take him with you, cure him.’
362 tender is the night
‘it’s impossible to commit a person on such grounds. i
wouldn’t if i could.’
the spaniard got up from his knees.
‘i have been hasty—i have been driven—‘
descending to the lobby dick met doctor dangeu in the
elevator.
‘i was about to call your room,’ the latter said. ‘can we
speak out on the terrace?’
‘is mr. warren dead?’ dick demanded.
‘he is the same—the consultation is in the morning.
meanwhile he wants to see his daughter—your wife—with
the greatest fervor. it seems there was some quarrel—‘
‘i know all about that.’
the doctors looked at each other, thinking.
‘why don’t you talk to him before you make up your
mind?’ dangeu suggested. ‘his death will be graceful—
merely a weakening and sinking.’
with an effort dick consented.
‘all right.’
the suite in which devereux warren was gracefully
weakening and sinking was of the same size as that of the
señor pardo y cuidad real—throughout this hotel there
were many chambers wherein rich ruins, fugitives from justice,
claimants to the thrones of mediatized principalities,
lived on the derivatives of opium or barbitol listening eternally
as to an inescapable radio, to the coarse melodies of old
sins. this corner of europe does not so much draw people as
accept them without inconvenient questions. routes cross
here—people bound for private sanitariums or tuberculosis 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 363
resorts in the mountains, people who are no longer persona
gratis in france or italy.
the suite was darkened. a nun with a holy face was nursing
the man whose emaciated fingers stirred a rosary on the
white sheet. he was still handsome and his voice summoned
up a thick burr of individuality as he spoke to dick, after
dangeu had left them together.
‘we get a lot of understanding at the end of life. only now,
doctor diver, do i realize what it was all about.’
dick waited.
‘i’ve been a bad man. you must know how little right i
have to see nicole again, yet a bigger man than either of us
says to forgive and to pity.’ the rosary slipped from his weak
hands and slid off the smooth bed covers. dick picked it up
for him. ‘if i could see nicole for ten minutes i would go
happy out of the world.’
‘it’s not a decision i can make for myself,’ said dick. ‘nicole
is not strong.’ he made his decision but pretended to
hesitate. ‘i can put it up to my professional associate.’
‘what your associate says goes with me—very well, doctor.
let me tell you my debt to you is so large—‘
dick stood up quickly.
‘i’ll let you know the result through doctor dangeu.’
in his room he called the clinic on the zugersee. after a
long time kaethe answered from her own house.
‘i want to get in touch with franz.’
‘franz is up on the mountain. i’m going up myself—is it
something i can tell him, dick?’
‘it’s about nicole—her father is dying here in lausanne. 
364 tender is the night
tell franz that, to show him it’s important; and ask him to
phone me from up there.’
‘i will.’
‘tell him i’ll be in my room here at the hotel from three
to five, and again from seven to eight, and after that to page
me in the dining-room.’
in plotting these hours he forgot to add that nicole was
not to be told; when he remembered it he was talking into a
dead telephone. certainly kaethe should realize.
... kaethe had no exact intention of telling nicole about
the call when she rode up the deserted hill of mountain wildflowers
and secret winds, where the patients were taken to
ski in winter and to climb in spring. getting off the train
she saw nicole shepherding the children through some organized
romp. approaching, she drew her arm gently along
nicole’s shoulder, saying: ‘you are clever with children—you
must teach them more about swimming in the summer.’
in the play they had grown hot, and nicole’s reflex in
drawing away from kaethe’s arm was automatic to the point
of rudeness. kaethe’s hand fell awkwardly into space, and
then she too reacted, verbally, and deplorably.
‘did you think i was going to embrace you?’ she demanded
sharply. ‘it was only about dick, i talked on the phone to
him and i was sorry—‘
‘is anything the matter with dick?’
kaethe suddenly realized her error, but she had taken a
tactless course and there was no choice but to answer as nicole
pursued her with reiterated questions: ‘... then why were
you sorry?’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 365
‘nothing about dick. i must talk to franz.’
‘it is about dick.’
there was terror in her face and collaborating alarm in
the faces of the diver children, near at hand. kaethe collapsed
with: ‘your father is ill in lausanne—dick wants to
talk to franz about it.’
‘is he very sick?’ nicole demanded—just as franz came up
with his hearty hospital manner. gratefully kaethe passed
the remnant of the buck to him—but the damage was done.
‘i’m going to lausanne,’ announced nicole.
‘one minute,’ said franz. ‘i’m not sure it’s advisable. i
must first talk on the phone to dick.’
‘then i’ll miss the train down,’ nicole protested, ‘and
then i’ll miss the three o’clock from zurich! if my father is
dying i must—‘ she left this in the air, afraid to formulate
it. ‘i must go. i’ll have to run for the train.’ she was running
even as she spoke toward the sequence of flat cars that
crowned the bare hill with bursting steam and sound. over
her shoulder she called back, ‘if you phone dick tell him i’m
coming, franz!’ ...
... dick was in his own room in the hotel reading the new
york herald when the swallow-like nun rushed in—simultaneously
the phone rang.
‘is he dead?’ dick demanded of the nun, hopefully.
‘monsieur, il est parti—he has gone away.’
‘com-ment?’
‘il est parti—his man and his baggage have gone away
too!’
it was incredible. a man in that condition to arise and 
366 tender is the night
depart.
dick answered the phone-call from franz. ‘you shouldn’t
have told nicole,’ he protested.
‘kaethe told her, very unwisely.’
‘i suppose it was my fault. never tell a thing to a woman
till it’s done. however, i’ll meet nicole ... say, franz, the craziest
thing has happened down here—the old boy took up
his bed and walked... .’
‘at what? what did you say?’
‘i say he walked, old warren—he walked!’
‘but why not?’
‘he was supposed to be dying of general collapse ... he
got up and walked away, back to chicago, i guess... . i don’t
know, the nurse is here now... . i don’t know, franz—i’ve just
heard about it... . call me later.’
he spent the better part of two hours tracing warren’s
movements. the patient had found an opportunity between
the change of day and night nurses to resort to the bar where
he had gulped down four whiskeys; he paid his hotel bill
with a thousand dollar note, instructing the desk that the
change should be sent after him, and departed, presumably
for america. a last minute dash by dick and dangeu
to overtake him at the station resulted only in dick’s failing
to meet nicole; when they did meet in the lobby of the hotel
she seemed suddenly tired, and there was a tight purse to her
lips that disquieted him.
‘how’s father?’ she demanded.
‘he’s much better. he seemed to have a good deal of reserve
energy after all.’ he hesitated, breaking it to her easy. 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 367
‘in fact he got up and went away.’
wanting a drink, for the chase had occupied the dinner
hour, he led her, puzzled, toward the grill, and continued as
they occupied two leather easy-chairs and ordered a highball
and a glass of beer: ‘the man who was taking care of
him made a wrong prognosis or something—wait a minute,
i’ve hardly had time to think the thing out myself.’
‘he’s gone?’
‘he got the evening train for paris.’
they sat silent. from nicole flowed a vast tragic apathy.
‘it was instinct,’ dick said, finally. ‘he was really dying,
but he tried to get a resumption of rhythm—he’s not the
first person that ever walked off his death-bed—like an old
clock—you know, you shake it and somehow from sheer
habit it gets going again. now your father—‘
‘oh, don’t tell me,’ she said.
‘his principal fuel was fear,’ he continued. ‘he got afraid,
and off he went. he’ll probably live till ninety—‘
‘please don’t tell me any more,’ she said. ‘please don’t—i
couldn’t stand any more.’
‘all right. the little devil i came down to see is hopeless.
we may as well go back to-morrow.’
‘i don’t see why you have to—come in contact with all
this,’ she burst forth.
‘oh, don’t you? sometimes i don’t either.’
she put her hand on his.
‘oh, i’m sorry i said that, dick.’
some one had brought a phonograph into the bar and
they sat listening to the wedding of the painted doll.
368 tender is the night
iii
one morning a week later, stopping at the desk for his
mail, dick became aware of some extra commotion outside:
patient von cohn morris was going away. his parents, australians,
were putting his baggage vehemently into a large
limousine, and beside them stood doctor ladislau protesting
with ineffectual attitudes against the violent gesturings
of morris, senior. the young man was regarding his embarkation
with aloof cynicism as doctor diver approached.
‘isn’t this a little sudden, mr. morris?’
mr. morris started as he saw dick—his florid face and the
large checks on his suit seemed to turn off and on like electric
lights. he approached dick as though to strike him.
‘high time we left, we and those who have come with
us,’ he began, and paused for breath. ‘it is high time, doctor
diver. high time.’
‘will you come in my office?’ dick suggested.
‘not i! i’ll talk to you, but i’m washing my hands of you
and your place.’
he shook his finger at dick. ‘i was just telling this doctor
here. we’ve wasted our time and our money.’
doctor ladislau stirred in a feeble negative, signalling
up a vague slavic evasiveness. dick had never liked ladislau.
he managed to walk the excited australian along the
path in the direction of his office, trying to persuade him to 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 369
enter; but the man shook his head.
‘it’s you, doctor diver, you, the very man. i went to
doctor ladislau because you were not to be found, doctor
diver, and because doctor gregorovius is not expected until
the nightfall, and i would not wait. no, sir! i would not
wait a minute after my son told me the truth.’
he came up menacingly to dick, who kept his hands
loose enough to drop him if it seemed necessary. ‘my son is
here for alcoholism, and he told us he smelt liquor on your
breath. yes, sir!’ he made a quick, apparently unsuccessful
sniff. ‘not once, but twice von cohn says he has smelt
liquor on your breath. i and my lady have never touched
a drop of it in our lives. we hand von cohn to you to be
cured, and within a month he twice smells liquor on your
breath! what kind of cure is that there?’
dick hesitated; mr. morris was quite capable of making
a scene on the clinic drive.
‘after all, mr. morris, some people are not going to give
up what they regard as food because of your son—‘
‘but you’re a doctor, man!’ cried morris furiously. ‘when
the workmen drink their beer that’s bad ‘cess to them—but
you’re here supposing to cure—‘
‘this has gone too far. your son came to us because of
kleptomania.’
‘what was behind it?’ the man was almost shrieking.
‘drink—black drink. do you know what color black is? it’s
black! my own uncle was hung by the neck because of it,
you hear? my son comes to a sanitarium, and a doctor reeks
of it!’
370 tender is the night
‘i must ask you to leave.’
‘you ask me! we are leaving!’
‘if you could be a little temperate we could tell you the
results of the treatment to date. naturally, since you feel as
you do, we would not want your son as a patient—‘
‘you dare to use the word temperate to me?’
dick called to doctor ladislau and as he approached,
said: ‘will you represent us in saying good-by to the patient
and to his family?’
he bowed slightly to morris and went into his office, and
stood rigid for a moment just inside the door. he watched
until they drove away, the gross parents, the bland, degenerate
offspring: it was easy to prophesy the family’s swing
around europe, bullying their betters with hard ignorance
and hard money. but what absorbed dick after the disappearance
of the caravan was the question as to what extent
he had provoked this. he drank claret with each meal, took
a nightcap, generally in the form of hot rum, and sometimes
he tippled with gin in the afternoons—gin was the most difficult
to detect on the breath. he was averaging a halfpint of
alcohol a day, too much for his system to burn up.
dismissing a tendency to justify himself, he sat down
at his desk and wrote out, like a prescription, a régime
that would cut his liquor in half. doctors, chauffeurs, and
protestant clergymen could never smell of liquor, as could
painters, brokers, cavalry leaders; dick blamed himself only
for indiscretion. but the matter was by no means clarified
half an hour later when franz, revivified by an alpine fortnight,
rolled up the drive, so eager to resume work that he 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 371
was plunged in it before he reached his office. dick met him
there.
‘how was mount everest?’
‘we could very well have done mount everest the rate we
were doing. we thought of it. how goes it all? how is my
kaethe, how is your nicole?’
‘all goes smooth domestically. but my god, franz, we
had a rotten scene this morning.’
‘how? what was it?’
dick walked around the room while franz got in touch
with his villa by telephone. after the family exchange was
over, dick said: ‘the morris boy was taken away—there was
a row.’
franz’s buoyant face fell.
‘i knew he’d left. i met ladislau on the veranda.’
‘what did ladislau say?’
‘just that young morris had gone—that you’d tell me
about it. what about it?’
‘the usual incoherent reasons.’
‘he was a devil, that boy.’
‘he was a case for anesthesia,’ dick agreed. ‘anyhow,
the father had beaten ladislau into a colonial subject by the
time i came along. what about ladislau? do we keep him? i
say no—he’s not much of a man, he can’t seem to cope with
anything.’ dick hesitated on the verge of the truth, swung
away to give himself space within which to recapitulate.
franz perched on the edge of a desk, still in his linen duster
and travelling gloves. dick said:
‘one of the remarks the boy made to his father was that 
372 tender is the night
your distinguished collaborator was a drunkard. the man
is a fanatic, and the descendant seems to have caught traces
of vin-du-pays on me.’
franz sat down, musing on his lower lip. ‘you can tell me
at length,’ he said finally.
‘why not now?’ dick suggested. ‘you must know i’m the
last man to abuse liquor.’ his eyes and franz’s glinted on
each other, pair on pair. ‘ladislau let the man get so worked
up that i was on the defensive. it might have happened in
front of patients, and you can imagine how hard it could be
to defend yourself in a situation like that!’
franz took off his gloves and coat. he went to the door
and told the secretary, ‘don’t disturb us.’ coming back into
the room he flung himself at the long table and fooled with
his mail, reasoning as little as is characteristic of people in
such postures, rather summoning up a suitable mask for
what he had to say.
‘dick, i know well that you are a temperate, well-balanced
man, even though we do not entirely agree on the
subject of alcohol. but a time has come—dick, i must say
frankly that i have been aware several times that you have
had a drink when it was not the moment to have one. there
is some reason. why not try another leave of abstinence?’
‘absence,’ dick corrected him automatically. ‘it’s no solution
for me to go away.’
they were both chafed, franz at having his return
marred and blurred.
‘sometimes you don’t use your common sense, dick.’
‘i never understood what common sense meant applied 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 373
to complicated problems—unless it means that a general
practitioner can perform a better operation than a specialist.’
he was seized by an overwhelming disgust for the situation.
to explain, to patch—these were not natural functions
at their age— better to continue with the cracked echo of an
old truth in the ears.
‘this is no go,’ he said suddenly.
‘well, that’s occurred to me,’ franz admitted. ‘your heart
isn’t in this project any more, dick.’
‘i know. i want to leave—we could strike some arrangement
about taking nicole’s money out gradually.’
‘i have thought about that too, dick—i have seen this
coming. i am able to arrange other backing, and it will be
possible to take all your money out by the end of the year.’
dick had not intended to come to a decision so quickly,
nor was he prepared for franz’s so ready acquiescence in
the break, yet he was relieved. not without desperation he
had long felt the ethics of his profession dissolving into a
lifeless mass.
374 tender is the night
iv
the divers would return to the riviera, which was home.
the villa diana had been rented again for the summer, so
they divided the intervening time between german spas
and french cathedral towns where they were always happy
for a few days. dick wrote a little with no particular method;
it was one of those parts of life that is an awaiting; not
upon nicole’s health, which seemed to thrive on travel, nor
upon work, but simply an awaiting. the factor that gave
purposefulness to the period was the children.
dick’s interest in them increased with their ages, now
eleven and nine. he managed to reach them over the heads
of employees on the principle that both the forcing of
children and the fear of forcing them were inadequate substitutes
for the long, careful watchfulness, the checking and
balancing and reckoning of accounts, to the end that there
should be no slip below a certain level of duty. he came to
know them much better than nicole did, and in expansive
moods over the wines of several countries he talked and
played with them at length. they had that wistful charm,
almost sadness, peculiar to children who have learned early
not to cry or laugh with abandon; they were apparently
moved to no extremes of emotion, but content with a simple
regimentation and the simple pleasures allowed them. they
lived on the even tenor found advisable in the experience of 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 375
old families of the western world, brought up rather than
brought out. dick thought, for example, that nothing was
more conducive to the development of observation than
compulsory silence.
lanier was an unpredictable boy with an inhuman curiosity.
‘well, how many pomeranians would it take to lick
a lion, father?’ was typical of the questions with which he
harassed dick. topsy was easier. she was nine and very fair
and exquisitely made like nicole, and in the past dick had
worried about that. lately she had become as robust as any
american child. he was satisfied with them both, but conveyed
the fact to them only in a tacit way. they were not let
off breaches of good conduct—‘either one learns politeness
at home,’ dick said, ‘or the world teaches it to you with a
whip and you may get hurt in the process. what do i care
whether topsy ‘adores’ me or not? i’m not bringing her up
to be my wife.’
another element that distinguished this summer and
autumn for the divers was a plenitude of money. due to the
sale of their interest in the clinic, and to developments in
america, there was now so much that the mere spending of
it, the care of goods, was an absorption in itself. the style in
which they travelled seemed fabulous.
regard them, for example, as the train slows up at boyen
where they are to spend a fortnight visiting. the shifting
from the wagon-lit has begun at the italian frontier. the
governess’s maid and madame diver’s maid have come up
from second class to help with the baggage and the dogs.
mlle. bellois will superintend the handluggage, leaving the 
376 tender is the night
sealyhams to one maid and the pair of pekinese to the other.
it is not necessarily poverty of spirit that makes a woman
surround herself with life—it can be a superabundance of
interest, and, except during her flashes of illness, nicole was
capable of being curator of it all. for example with the great
quantity of heavy baggage—presently from the van would
be unloaded four wardrobe trunks, a shoe trunk, three hat
trunks, and two hat boxes, a chest of servants’ trunks, a
portable filing-cabinet, a medicine case, a spirit lamp container,
a picnic set, four tennis rackets in presses and cases,
a phonograph, a typewriter. distributed among the spaces
reserved for family and entourage were two dozen supplementary
grips, satchels and packages, each one numbered,
down to the tag on the cane case. thus all of it could be
checked up in two minutes on any station platform, some
for storage, some for accompaniment from the ‘light trip
list’ or the ‘heavy trip list,’ constantly revised, and carried
on metal-edged plaques in nicole’s purse. she had devised
the system as a child when travelling with her failing mother.
it was equivalent to the system of a regimental supply
officer who must think of the bellies and equipment of three
thousand men.
the divers flocked from the train into the early gathered
twilight of the valley. the village people watched the
debarkation with an awe akin to that which followed the
italian pilgrimages of lord byron a century before. their
hostess was the contessa di minghetti, lately mary north.
the journey that had begun in a room over the shop of a
paperhanger in newark had ended in an extraordinary 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 377
marriage.
‘conte di minghetti’ was merely a papal title—the wealth
of mary’s husband flowed from his being ruler-owner of
manganese deposits in southwestern asia. he was not quite
light enough to travel in a pullman south of mason-dixon;
he was of the kyble-berber-sabaeanhindu strain that belts
across north africa and asia, more sympathetic to the european
than the mongrel faces of the ports.
when these princely households, one of the east, one
of the west, faced each other on the station platform, the
splendor of the divers seemed pioneer simplicity by comparison.
their hosts were accompanied by an italian
major-domo carrying a staff, by a quartet of turbaned retainers
on motorcycles, and by two half-veiled females who
stood respectfully a little behind mary and salaamed at nicole,
making her jump with the gesture.
to mary as well as to the divers the greeting was faintly
comic; mary gave an apologetic, belittling giggle; yet her
voice, as she introduced her husband by his asiatic title,
flew proud and high.
in their rooms as they dressed for dinner, dick and nicole
grimaced at each other in an awed way: such rich as
want to be thought democratic pretend in private to be
swept off their feet by swank.
‘little mary north knows what she wants,’ dick muttered
through his shaving cream. ‘abe educated her, and
now she’s married to a buddha. if europe ever goes bolshevik
she’ll turn up as the bride of stalin.’
nicole looked around from her dressing-case. ‘watch 
378 tender is the night
your tongue, dick, will you?’ but she laughed. ‘they’re very
swell. the warships all fire at them or salute them or something.
mary rides in the royal bus in london.’
‘all right,’ he agreed. as he heard nicole at the door
asking for pins, he called, ‘i wonder if i could have some
whiskey; i feel the mountain air!’
‘she’ll see to it,’ presently nicole called through the bathroom
door. ‘it was one of those women who were at the
station. she has her veil off.’
‘what did mary tell you about life?’ he asked.
‘she didn’t say so much—she was interested in high
life—she asked me a lot of questions about my genealogy
and all that sort of thing, as if i knew anything about it.
but it seems the bridegroom has two very tan children by
another marriage—one of them ill with some asiatic thing
they can’t diagnose. i’ve got to warn the children. sounds
very peculiar to me. mary will see how we’d feel about it.’
she stood worrying a minute.
‘she’ll understand,’ dick reassured her. ‘probably the
child’s in bed.’
at dinner dick talked to hosain, who had been at an
english public school. hosain wanted to know about stocks
and about hollywood and dick, whipping up his imagination
with champagne, told him preposterous tales.
‘billions?’ hosain demanded.
‘trillions,’ dick assured him.
‘i didn’t truly realize—‘
‘well, perhaps millions,’ dick conceded. ‘every hotel
guest is assigned a harem—or what amounts to a harem.’
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 379
‘other than the actors and directors?’
‘every hotel guest—even travelling salesmen. why, they
tried to send me up a dozen candidates, but nicole wouldn’t
stand for it.’
nicole reproved him when they were in their room alone.
‘why so many highballs? why did you use your word spic
in front of him?’
‘excuse me, i meant smoke. the tongue slipped.’
‘dick, this isn’t faintly like you.’
‘excuse me again. i’m not much like myself any more.’
that night dick opened a bathroom window, giving on
a narrow and tubular court of the château, gray as rats but
echoing at the moment to plaintive and peculiar music, sad
as a flute. two men were chanting in an eastern language
or dialect full of k’s and l’s—he leaned out but he could not
see them; there was obviously a religious significance in the
sounds, and tired and emotionless he let them pray for him
too, but what for, save that he should not lose himself in his
increasing melancholy, he did not know.
next day, over a thinly wooded hillside they shot scrawny
birds, distant poor relations to the partridge. it was done
in a vague imitation of the english manner, with a corps of
inexperienced beaters whom dick managed to miss by firing
only directly overhead.
on their return lanier was waiting in their suite.
‘father, you said tell you immediately if we were near the
sick boy.’
nicole whirled about, immediately on guard.
‘—so, mother,’ lanier continued, turning to her, ‘the boy 
380 tender is the night
takes a bath every evening and to-night he took his bath
just before mine and i had to take mine in his water, and it
was dirty.’
‘what? now what?’
‘i saw them take tony out of it, and then they called me
into it and the water was dirty.’
‘but—did you take it?’
‘yes, mother.’
‘heavens!’ she exclaimed to dick.
he demanded: ‘why didn’t lucienne draw your bath?’
‘lucienne can’t. it’s a funny heater—it reached out of itself
and burned her arm last night and she’s afraid of it, so
one of those two women—‘
‘you go in this bathroom and take a bath now.’
‘don’t say i told you,’ said lanier from the doorway.
dick went in and sprinkled the tub with sulphur; closing
the door he said to nicole:
‘either we speak to mary or we’d better get out.’
she agreed and he continued: ‘people think their children
are constitutionally cleaner than other people’s, and
their diseases are less contagious.’
dick came in and helped himself from the decanter,
chewing a biscuit savagely in the rhythm of the pouring water
in the bathroom.
‘tell lucienne that she’s got to learn about the heater—‘
he suggested. at that moment the asiatic woman came in
person to the door.
‘el contessa—‘
dick beckoned her inside and closed the door.

‘is the little sick boy better?’ he inquired pleasantly.
‘better, yes, but he still has the eruptions frequently.’
‘that’s too bad—i’m very sorry. but you see our children
mustn’t be bathed in his water. that’s out of the question—
i’m sure your mistress would be furious if she had known
you had done a thing like that.’
‘i?’ she seemed thunderstruck. ‘why, i merely saw your
maid had difficulty with the heater—i told her about it and
started the water.’
‘but with a sick person you must empty the bathwater
entirely out, and clean the tub.’
‘i?’
chokingly the woman drew a long breath, uttered a convulsed
sob and rushed from the room.
‘she mustn’t get up on western civilization at our expense,’
he said grimly.
at dinner that night he decided that it must inevitably
be a truncated visit: about his own country hosain seemed
to have observed only that there were many mountains and
some goats and herders of goats. he was a reserved young
man—to draw him out would have required the sincere effort
that dick now reserved for his family. soon after dinner
hosain left mary and the divers to themselves, but the old
unity was split—between them lay the restless social fields
that mary was about to conquer. dick was relieved when, at
nine-thirty, mary received and read a note and got up.
‘you’ll have to excuse me. my husband is leaving on a
short trip— and i must be with him.’
next morning, hard on the heels of the servant bringing 
382 tender is the night
coffee, mary entered their room. she was dressed and they
were not dressed, and she had the air of having been up for
some time. her face was toughened with quiet jerky fury.
‘what is this story about lanier having been bathed in
a dirty bath?’
dick began to protest, but she cut through:
‘what is this story that you commanded my husband’s
sister to clean lanier’s tub?’
she remained on her feet staring at them, as they sat
impotent as idols in their beds, weighted by their trays. together
they exclaimed: ‘his sister!’
‘that you ordered one of his sisters to clean out a tub!’
‘we didn’t—‘ their voices rang together saying the same
thing, ‘— i spoke to the native servant—‘
‘you spoke to hosain’s sister.’
dick could only say: ‘i supposed they were two maids.’
‘you were told they were himadoun.’
‘what?’ dick got out of bed and into a robe.
‘i explained it to you at the piano night before last. don’t
tell me you were too merry to understand.’
‘was that what you said? i didn’t hear the beginning. i
didn’t connect the—we didn’t make any connection, mary.
well, all we can do is see her and apologize.’
‘see her and apologize! i explained to you that when the
oldest member of the family—when the oldest one marries,
well, the two oldest sisters consecrate themselves to being
himadoun, to being his wife’s ladies-in-waiting.’
‘was that why hosain left the house last night?’
mary hesitated; then nodded.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 383
‘he had to—they all left. his honor makes it necessary.’
now both the divers were up and dressing; mary went
on:
‘and what’s all that about the bathwater. as if a thing like
that could happen in this house! we’ll ask lanier about it.’
dick sat on the bedside indicating in a private gesture to
nicole that she should take over. meanwhile mary went to
the door and spoke to an attendant in italian.
‘wait a minute,’ nicole said. ‘i won’t have that.’
‘you accused us,’ answered mary, in a tone she had never
used to nicole before. ‘now i have a right to see.’
‘i won’t have the child brought in.’ nicole threw on her
clothes as though they were chain mail.
‘that’s all right,’ said dick. ‘bring lanier in. we’ll settle
this bathtub matter—fact or myth.’
lanier, half clothed mentally and physically, gazed at the
angered faces of the adults.
‘listen, lanier,’ mary demanded, ‘how did you come to
think you were bathed in water that had been used before?’
‘speak up,’ dick added.
‘it was just dirty, that was all.’
‘couldn’t you hear the new water running, from your
room, next door?’
lanier admitted the possibility but reiterated his point—
the water was dirty. he was a little awed; he tried to see
ahead:
‘it couldn’t have been running, because—‘
they pinned him down.
‘why not?’
384 tender is the night
he stood in his little kimono arousing the sympathy of
his parents and further arousing mary’s impatience—then
he said:
‘the water was dirty, it was full of soap-suds.’
‘when you’re not sure what you’re saying—‘ mary began,
but nicole interrupted.
‘stop it, mary. if there were dirty suds in the water it was
logical to think it was dirty. his father told him to come—‘
‘there couldn’t have been dirty suds in the water.’
lanier looked reproachfully at his father, who had betrayed
him. nicole turned him about by the shoulders and
sent him out of the room; dick broke the tensity with a
laugh.
then, as if the sound recalled the past, the old friendship,
mary guessed how far away from them she had gone
and said in a mollifying tone: ‘it’s always like that with children.’
her uneasiness grew as she remembered the past. ‘you’d
be silly to go—hosain wanted to make this trip anyhow.
after all, you’re my guests and you just blundered into the
thing.’ but dick, made more angry by this obliqueness and
the use of the word blunder, turned away and began arranging
his effects, saying:
‘it’s too bad about the young women. i’d like to apologize
to the one who came in here.’
‘if you’d only listened on the piano seat!’
‘but you’ve gotten so damned dull, mary. i listened as
long as i could.’
‘be quiet!’ nicole advised him.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 385
‘i return his compliment,’ said mary bitterly. ‘good-by,
nicole.’ she went out.
after all that there was no question of her coming to see
them off; the major-domo arranged the departure. dick left
formal notes for hosain and the sisters. there was nothing
to do except to go, but all of them, especially lanier, felt bad
about it.
‘i insist,’ insisted lanier on the train, ‘that it was dirty
bathwater.’
‘that’ll do,’ his father said. ‘you better forget it—unless
you want me to divorce you. did you know there was a new
law in france that you can divorce a child?’
lanier roared with delight and the divers were unified
again—dick wondered how many more times it could be
done.
386 tender is the night
v
nicole went to the window and bent over the sill to take
a look at the rising altercation on the terrace; the april sun
shone pink on the saintly face of augustine, the cook, and
blue on the butcher’s knife she waved in her drunken hand.
she had been with them since their return to villa diana in
february.
because of an obstruction of an awning she could see
only dick’s head and his hand holding one of his heavy
canes with a bronze knob on it. the knife and the cane,
menacing each other, were like tripos and short sword in a
gladiatorial combat. dick’s words reached her first:
‘—care how much kitchen wine you drink but when i
find you digging into a bottle of chablis moutonne—‘
‘you talk about drinking!’ augustine cried, flourishing
her sabre. ‘you drink—all the time!’
nicole called over the awning: ‘what’s the matter, dick?’
and he answered in english:
‘the old girl has been polishing off the vintage wines. i’m
firing her—at least i’m trying to.’
‘heavens! well, don’t let her reach you with that knife.’
augustine shook her knife up at nicole. her old mouth
was made of two small intersecting cherries.
‘i would like to say, madame, if you knew that your
husband drinks over at his bastide comparatively as a day-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 387
laborer—‘
‘shut up and get out!’ interrupted nicole. ‘we’ll get the
gendarmes.’
‘you’ll get the gendarmes! with my brother in the
corps! you—a disgusting american?’
in english dick called up to nicole:
‘get the children away from the house till i settle this.’
‘—disgusting americans who come here and drink up
our finest wines,’ screamed augustine with the voice of the
commune.
dick mastered a firmer tone.
‘you must leave now! i’ll pay you what we owe you.’
‘very sure you’ll pay me! and let me tell you—‘ she came
close and waved the knife so furiously that dick raised his
stick, whereupon she rushed into the kitchen and returned
with the carving knife reinforced by a hatchet.
the situation was not prepossessing—augustine was a
strong woman and could be disarmed only at the risk of
serious results to herself—and severe legal complications
which were the lot of one who molested a french citizen.
trying a bluff dick called up to nicole:
‘phone the poste de police.’ then to augustine, indicating
her armament, ‘this means arrest for you.’
‘ha-ha!’ she laughed demoniacally; nevertheless she
came no nearer. nicole phoned the police but was answered
with what was almost an echo of augustine’s laugh. she
heard mumbles and passings of the word around—the connection
was suddenly broken.
returning to the window she called down to dick: ‘give 
388 tender is the night
her something extra!’
‘if i could get to that phone!’ as this seemed impracticable,
dick capitulated. for fifty francs, increased to a
hundred as he succumbed to the idea of getting her out hastily,
augustine yielded her fortress, covering the retreat with
stormy grenades of ‘salaud!’ she would leave only when her
nephew could come for her baggage. waiting cautiously in
the neighborhood of the kitchen dick heard a cork pop, but
he yielded the point. there was no further trouble—when
the nephew arrived, all apologetic, augustine bade dick a
cheerful, convivial good-by and called up ‘all revoir, madame!
bonne chance!’ to nicole’s window.
the divers went to nice and dined on a bouillabaisse,
which is a stew of rock fish and small lobsters, highly
seasoned with saffron, and a bottle of cold chablis. he expressed
pity for augustine.
‘i’m not sorry a bit,’ said nicole.
‘i’m sorry—and yet i wish i’d shoved her over the cliff.’
there was little they dared talk about in these days; seldom
did they find the right word when it counted, it arrived
always a moment too late when one could not reach the
other any more. tonight augustine’s outburst had shaken
them from their separate reveries; with the burn and chill of
the spiced broth and the parching wine they talked.
‘we can’t go on like this,’ nicole suggested. ‘or can we?—
what do you think?’ startled that for the moment dick did
not deny it, she continued, ‘some of the time i think it’s my
fault—i’ve ruined you.’
‘so i’m ruined, am i?’ he inquired pleasantly.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 389
‘i didn’t mean that. but you used to want to create
things—now you seem to want to smash them up.’
she trembled at criticizing him in these broad terms—
but his enlarging silence frightened her even more. she
guessed that something was developing behind the silence,
behind the hard, blue eyes, the almost unnatural interest
in the children. uncharacteristic bursts of temper surprised
her—he would suddenly unroll a long scroll of contempt for
some person, race, class, way of life, way of thinking. it was
as though an incalculable story was telling itself inside him,
about which she could only guess at in the moments when it
broke through the surface.
‘after all, what do you get out of this?’ she demanded.
‘knowing you’re stronger every day. knowing that your
illness follows the law of diminishing returns.’
his voice came to her from far off, as though he were
speaking of something remote and academic; her alarm
made her exclaim, ‘dick!’ and she thrust her hand forward
to his across the table. a reflex pulled dick’s hand back and
he added: ‘there’s the whole situation to think of, isn’t there?
there’s not just you.’ he covered her hand with his and said
in the old pleasant voice of a conspirator for pleasure, mischief,
profit, and delight:
‘see that boat out there?’
it was the motor yacht of t. f. golding lying placid
among the little swells of the nicean bay, constantly bound
upon a romantic voyage that was not dependent upon actual
motion. ‘we’ll go out there now and ask the people on
board what’s the matter with them. we’ll find out if they’re 
390 tender is the night
happy.’
‘we hardly know him,’ nicole objected.
‘he urged us. besides, baby knows him—she practically
married him, doesn’t she—didn’t she?’
when they put out from the port in a hired launch it
was already summer dusk and lights were breaking out in
spasms along the rigging of the margin. as they drew up
alongside, nicole’s doubts reasserted themselves.
‘he’s having a party—‘
‘it’s only a radio,’ he guessed.
they were hailed—a huge white-haired man in a white
suit looked down at them, calling:
‘do i recognize the divers?’
‘boat ahoy, margin!’
their boat moved under the companionway; as they
mounted golding doubled his huge frame to give nicole a
hand.
‘just in time for dinner.’
a small orchestra was playing astern.
‘i’m yours for the asking—but till then you can’t ask me
to behave—‘
and as golding’s cyclonic arms blew them aft without
touching them, nicole was sorrier they had come, and more
impatient at dick. having taken up an attitude of aloofness
from the gay people here, at the time when dick’s work
and her health were incompatible with going about, they
had a reputation as refusers. riviera replacements during
the ensuing years interpreted this as a vague unpopularity.
nevertheless, having taken such a stand, nicole felt it 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 391
should not be cheaply compromised for a momentary selfindulgence.
as they passed through the principal salon they saw
ahead of them figures that seemed to dance in the half light
of the circular stern. this was an illusion made by the enchantment
of the music, the unfamiliar lighting, and the
surrounding presence of water. actually, save for some busy
stewards, the guests loafed on a wide divan that followed
the curve of the deck. there were a white, a red, a blurred
dress, the laundered chests of several men, of whom one,
detaching and identifying himself, brought from nicole a
rare little cry of delight.
‘tommy!’
brushing aside the gallicism of his formal dip at her
hand, nicole pressed her face against his. they sat, or rather
lay down together on the antoninian bench. his handsome
face was so dark as to have lost the pleasantness of deep tan,
without attaining the blue beauty of negroes—it was just
worn leather. the foreignness of his depigmentation by unknown
suns, his nourishment by strange soils, his tongue
awkward with the curl of many dialects, his reactions attuned
to odd alarms—these things fascinated and rested
nicole—in the moment of meeting she lay on his bosom,
spiritually, going out and out... . then self-preservation
reasserted itself and retiring to her own world she spoke
lightly.
‘you look just like all the adventurers in the movies—but
why do you have to stay away so long?’
tommy barban looked at her, uncomprehending but 
392 tender is the night
alert; the pupils of his eyes flashed.
‘five years,’ she continued, in throaty mimicry of nothing.
‘much too long. couldn’t you only slaughter a certain
number of creatures and then come back, and breathe our
air for a while?’
in her cherished presence tommy europeanized himself
quickly.
‘mais pour nous héros,’ he said, ‘il nous faut du temps,
nicole. nous ne pouvons pas faire de petits exercises
d’héroisme—il faut faire les grandes compositions.’
‘talk english to me, tommy.’
‘parlez français avec moi, nicole.’
‘but the meanings are different—in french you can be
heroic and gallant with dignity, and you know it. but in
english you can’t be heroic and gallant without being a little
absurd, and you know that too. that gives me an advantage.’
‘but after all—‘ he chuckled suddenly. ‘even in english
i’m brave, heroic and all that.’
she pretended to be groggy with wonderment but he was
not abashed.
‘i only know what i see in the cinema,’ he said.
‘is it all like the movies?’
‘the movies aren’t so bad—now this ronald colman—
have you seen his pictures about the corps d’afrique du
nord? they’re not bad at all.’
‘very well, whenever i go to the movies i’ll know you’re
going through just that sort of thing at that moment.’
as she spoke, nicole was aware of a small, pale, pretty 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 393
young woman with lovely metallic hair, almost green in the
deck lights, who had been sitting on the other side of tommy
and might have been part either of their conversation or
of the one next to them. she had obviously had a monopoly
of tommy, for now she abandoned hope of his attention
with what was once called ill grace, and petulantly crossed
the crescent of the deck.
‘after all, i am a hero,’ tommy said calmly, only half joking.
‘i have ferocious courage, us-ually, something like a
lion, something like a drunken man.’
nicole waited until the echo of his boast had died away
in his mind—she knew he had probably never made such a
statement before. then she looked among the strangers, and
found as usual, the fierce neurotics, pretending calm, liking
the country only in horror of the city, of the sound of their
own voices which had set the tone and pitch... . she asked:
‘who is the woman in white?’
‘the one who was beside me? lady caroline siblybiers.’—they
listened for a moment to her voice across the
way:
‘the man’s a scoundrel, but he’s a cat of the stripe. we
sat up all night playing two-handed chemin-de-fer, and he
owes me a mille swiss.’
tommy laughed and said: ‘she is now the wickedest
woman in london— whenever i come back to europe there
is a new crop of the wickedest women from london. she’s
the very latest—though i believe there is now one other
who’s considered almost as wicked.’
nicole glanced again at the woman across the deck—she 
394 tender is the night
was fragile, tubercular—it was incredible that such narrow
shoulders, such puny arms could bear aloft the pennon of
decadence, last ensign of the fading empire. her resemblance
was rather to one of john held’s flat-chested flappers
than to the hierarchy of tall languid blondes who had posed
for painters and novelists since before the war.
golding approached, fighting down the resonance of
his huge bulk, which transmitted his will as through a gargantuan
amplifier, and nicole, still reluctant, yielded to his
reiterated points: that the margin was starting for cannes
immediately after dinner; that they could always pack in
some caviare and champagne, even though they had dined;
that in any case dick was now on the phone, telling their
chauffeur in nice to drive their car back to cannes and
leave it in front of the café des alliées where the divers
could retrieve it.
they moved into the dining salon and dick was placed
next to lady sibly-biers. nicole saw that his usually ruddy
face was drained of blood; he talked in a dogmatic voice, of
which only snatches reached nicole:
‘... it’s all right for you english, you’re doing a dance of
death... . sepoys in the ruined fort, i mean sepoys at the
gate and gaiety in the fort and all that. the green hat, the
crushed hat, no future.’
lady caroline answered him in short sentences spotted
with the terminal ‘what?’ the double-edged ‘quite!’ the
depressing ‘cheerio!’ that always had a connotation of imminent
peril, but dick appeared oblivious to the warning
signals. suddenly he made a particularly vehement pro-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 395
nouncement, the purport of which eluded nicole, but she
saw the young woman turn dark and sinewy, and heard her
answer sharply:
‘after all a chep’s a chep and a chum’s a chum.’
again he had offended some one—couldn’t he hold his
tongue a little longer? how long? to death then.
at the piano, a fair-haired young scotsman from the orchestra
(entitled by its drum ‘the ragtime college jazzes
of edinboro’) had begun singing in a danny deever monotone,
accompanying himself with low chords on the piano.
he pronounced his words with great precision, as though
they impressed him almost intolerably.
“there was a young lady from hell,
who jumped at the sound of a bell,
because she was bad—bad—bad,
she jumped at the sound of a bell,
from hell (boomboom)
from hell (toottoot)
there was a young lady from hell—‘
‘what is all this?’ whispered tommy to nicole.
the girl on the other side of him supplied the answer:
‘caroline sibly-biers wrote the words. he wrote the music.’
‘quelle enfanterie!’ tommy murmured as the next verse
began, hinting at the jumpy lady’s further predilections.
‘on dirait qu’il récite racine!’
on the surface at least, lady caroline was paying no at-
396 tender is the night
tention to the performance of her work. glancing at her
again nicole found herself impressed, neither with the
character nor the personality, but with the sheer strength
derived from an attitude; nicole thought that she was formidable,
and she was confirmed in this point of view as the
party rose from table. dick remained in his seat wearing an
odd expression; then he crashed into words with a harsh
ineptness.
‘i don’t like innuendo in these deafening english whispers.’
already half-way out of the room lady caroline turned
and walked back to him; she spoke in a low clipped voice
purposely audible to the whole company.
‘you came to me asking for it—disparaging my countrymen,
disparaging my friend, mary minghetti. i simply said
you were observed associating with a questionable crowd
in lausanne. is that a deafening whisper? or does it simply
deafen you?’
‘it’s still not loud enough,’ said dick, a little too late. ‘so i
am actually a notorious—‘
golding crushed out the phrase with his voice saying:
‘what! what!’ and moved his guests on out, with the
threat of his powerful body. turning the corner of the door
nicole saw that dick was still sitting at the table. she was furious
at the woman for her preposterous statement, equally
furious at dick for having brought them here, for having
become fuddled, for having untipped the capped barbs of
his irony, for having come off humiliated—she was a little
more annoyed because she knew that her taking posses-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 397
sion of tommy barban on their arrival had first irritated
the englishwoman.
a moment later she saw dick standing in the gangway,
apparently in complete control of himself as he talked with
golding; then for half an hour she did not see him anywhere
about the deck and she broke out of an intricate malay game,
played with string and coffee beans, and said to tommy:
‘i’ve got to find dick.’
since dinner the yacht had been in motion westward.
the fine night streamed away on either side, the diesel engines
pounded softly, there was a spring wind that blew
nicole’s hair abruptly when she reached the bow, and she
had a sharp lesion of anxiety at seeing dick standing in the
angle by the flagstaff. his voice was serene as he recognized
her.
‘it’s a nice night.’
‘i was worried.’
‘oh, you were worried?’
‘oh, don’t talk that way. it would give me so much pleasure
to think of a little something i could do for you, dick.’
he turned away from her, toward the veil of starlight
over africa.
‘i believe that’s true, nicole. and sometimes i believe
that the littler it was, the more pleasure it would give you.’
‘don’t talk like that—don’t say such things.’
his face, wan in the light that the white spray caught
and tossed back to the brilliant sky had none of the lines
of annoyance she had expected. it was even detached; his
eyes focussed upon her gradually as upon a chessman to be 
398 tender is the night
moved; in the same slow manner he caught her wrist and
drew her near.
‘you ruined me, did you?’ he inquired blandly. ‘then
we’re both ruined. so—‘
cold with terror she put her other wrist into his grip. all
right, she would go with him—again she felt the beauty of
the night vividly in one moment of complete response and
abnegation—all right, then—
—but now she was unexpectedly free and dick turned
his back sighing. ‘tch! tch!’
tears streamed down nicole’s face—in a moment she
heard some one approaching; it was tommy.
‘you found him! nicole thought maybe you jumped
overboard, dick,’ he said, ‘because that little english poule
slanged you.’
‘it’d be a good setting to jump overboard,’ said dick
mildly.
‘wouldn’t it?’ agreed nicole hastily. ‘let’s borrow lifepreservers
and jump over. i think we should do something
spectacular. i feel that all our lives have been too restrained.’
tommy sniffed from one to the other trying to breathe
in the situation with the night. ‘we’ll go ask the lady beerand-ale
what to do—she should know the latest things.
and we should memorize her song ‘there was a young lady
from l’enfer.’ i shall translate it, and make a fortune from its
success at the casino.’
‘are you rich, tommy?’ dick asked him, as they retraced
the length of the boat.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 399
‘not as things go now. i got tired of the brokerage business
and went away. but i have good stocks in the hands of
friends who are holding it for me. all goes well.’
‘dick’s getting rich,’ nicole said. in reaction her voice
had begun to tremble.
on the after deck golding had fanned three pairs of
dancers into action with his colossal paws. nicole and tommy
joined them and tommy remarked: ‘dick seems to be
drinking.’
‘only moderately,’ she said loyally.
‘there are those who can drink and those who can’t. obviously
dick can’t. you ought to tell him not to.’
‘i!’ she exclaimed in amazement. ‘i tell dick what he
should do or shouldn’t do!’
but in a reticent way dick was still vague and sleepy
when they reached the pier at cannes. golding buoyed him
down into the launch of the margin whereupon lady caroline
shifted her place conspicuously. on the dock he bowed
good-by with exaggerated formality, and for a moment he
seemed about to speed her with a salty epigram, but the
bone of tommy’s arm went into the soft part of his and they
walked to the attendant car.
‘i’ll drive you home,’ tommy suggested.
‘don’t bother—we can get a cab.’
‘i’d like to, if you can put me up.’
on the back seat of the car dick remained quiescent until
the yellow monolith of golfe juan was passed, and then the
constant carnival at juan les pins where the night was musical
and strident in many languages. when the car turned 
400 tender is the night
up the hill toward tarmes, he sat up suddenly, prompted by
the tilt of the vehicle and delivered a peroration:
‘a charming representative of the—‘ he stumbled momentarily,
‘—a firm of—bring me brains addled a l’anglaise.’
then he went into an appeased sleep, belching now and then
contentedly into the soft warm darkness.

next morning dick came early into nicole’s room. ‘i waited
till i heard you up. needless to say i feel badly about the
evening—but how about no postmortems?’
‘i’m agreed,’ she answered coolly, carrying her face to the
mirror.
‘tommy drove us home? or did i dream it?’
‘you know he did.’
‘seems probable,’ he admitted, ‘since i just heard him
coughing. i think i’ll call on him.’
she was glad when he left her, for almost the first time
in her life—his awful faculty of being right seemed to have
deserted him at last.
tommy was stirring in his bed, waking for café au lait.
‘feel all right?’ dick asked.
when tommy complained of a sore throat he seized at a
professional attitude.
‘better have a gargle or something.’
‘you have one?’
‘oddly enough i haven’t—probably nicole has.’
‘don’t disturb her.’
‘she’s up.’
‘how is she?’
dick turned around slowly. ‘did you expect her to be
dead because i was tight?’ his tone was pleasant. ‘nicole is 
402 tender is the night
now made of—of georgia pine, which is the hardest wood
known, except lignum vitæ from new zealand—‘
nicole, going downstairs, heard the end of the conversation.
she knew, as she had always known, that tommy
loved her; she knew he had come to dislike dick, and that
dick had realized it before he did, and would react in some
positive way to the man’s lonely passion. this thought was
succeeded by a moment of sheerly feminine satisfaction.
she leaned over her children’s breakfast table and told off
instructions to the governess, while upstairs two men were
concerned about her.
later in the garden she was happy; she did not want anything
to happen, but only for the situation to remain in
suspension as the two men tossed her from one mind to another;
she had not existed for a long time, even as a ball.
‘nice, rabbits, isn’t it—or is it? hey, rabbit—hey you! is
it nice?—hey? or does it sound very peculiar to you?’
the rabbit, after an experience of practically nothing else
and cabbage leaves, agreed after a few tentative shiftings of
the nose.
nicole went on through her garden routine. she left the
flowers she cut in designated spots to be brought to the
house later by the gardener. reaching the sea wall she fell
into a communicative mood and no one to communicate
with; so she stopped and deliberated. she was somewhat
shocked at the idea of being interested in another man—but
other women have lovers—why not me? in the fine spring
morning the inhibitions of the male world disappeared and
she reasoned as gaily as a flower, while the wind blew her 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 403
hair until her head moved with it. other women have had
lovers—the same forces that last night had made her yield
to dick up to the point of death, now kept her head nodding
to the wind, content and happy with the logic of, why
shouldn’t i?
she sat upon the low wall and looked down upon the
sea. but from another sea, the wide swell of fantasy, she
had fished out something tangible to lay beside the rest of
her loot. if she need not, in her spirit, be forever one with
dick as he had appeared last night, she must be something
in addition, not just an image on his mind, condemned to
endless parades around the circumference of a medal.
nicole had chosen this part of the wall on which to sit,
because the cliff shaded to a slanting meadow with a cultivated
vegetable garden. through a cluster of boughs she saw
two men carrying rakes and spades and talking in a counterpoint
of niçoise and provençal. attracted by their words
and gestures she caught the sense:
‘i laid her down here.’
‘i took her behind the vines there.’
‘she doesn’t care—neither does he. it was that sacred
dog. well, i laid her down here—‘
‘you got the rake?’
‘you got it yourself, you clown.’
‘well, i don’t care where you laid her down. until that
night i never even felt a woman’s breast against my chest
since i married— twelve years ago. and now you tell me—‘
‘but listen about the dog—‘
nicole watched them through the boughs; it seemed all 
404 tender is the night
right what they were saying—one thing was good for one
person, another for another. yet it was a man’s world she
had overheard; going back to the house she became doubtful
again.
dick and tommy were on the terrace. she walked
through them and into the house, brought out a sketch pad
and began a head of tommy.
‘hands never idle—distaff flying,’ dick said lightly. how
could he talk so trivially with the blood still drained down
from his cheeks so that the auburn lather of beard showed
red as his eyes? she turned to tommy saying:
‘i can always do something. i used to have a nice active
little polynesian ape and juggle him around for hours till
people began to make the most dismal rough jokes—‘
she kept her eyes resolutely away from dick. presently he
excused himself and went inside—she saw him pour himself
two glasses of water, and she hardened further.
‘nicole—‘ tommy began but interrupted himself to clear
the harshness from his throat.
‘i’m going to get you some special camphor rub,’ she
suggested. ‘it’s american—dick believes in it. i’ll be just a
minute.’
‘i must go really.’
dick came out and sat down. ‘believes in what?’ when
she returned with the jar neither of the men had moved,
though she gathered they had had some sort of excited conversation
about nothing.
the chauffeur was at the door, with a bag containing
tommy’s clothes of the night before. the sight of tommy 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 405
in clothes borrowed from dick moved her sadly, falsely, as
though tommy were not able to afford such clothes.
‘when you get to the hotel rub this into your throat and
chest and then inhale it,’ she said.
‘say, there,’ dick murmured as tommy went down the
steps, ‘don’t give tommy the whole jar—it has to be ordered
from paris—it’s out of stock down here.’
tommy came back within hearing and the three of them
stood in the sunshine, tommy squarely before the car so
that it seemed by leaning forward he would tip it upon his
back.
nicole stepped down to the path.
‘now catch it,’ she advised him. ‘it’s extremely rare.’
she heard dick grow silent at her side; she took a step off
from him and waved as the car drove off with tommy and
the special camphor rub. then she turned to take her own
medicine.
‘there was no necessity for that gesture,’ dick said.
‘there are four of us here—and for years whenever there’s
a cough—‘
they looked at each other.
‘we can always get another jar—‘ then she lost her nerve
and presently followed him upstairs where he lay down on
his own bed and said nothing.
‘do you want lunch to be brought up to you?’ she asked.
he nodded and continued to lie quiescent, staring at the
ceiling. doubtfully she went to give the order. upstairs again
she looked into his room—the blue eyes, like searchlights,
played on a dark sky. she stood a minute in the doorway, 
406 tender is the night
aware of the sin she had committed against him, half afraid
to come in... . she put out her hand as if to rub his head, but
he turned away like a suspicious animal. nicole could stand
the situation no longer; in a kitchen-maid’s panic she ran
downstairs, afraid of what the stricken man above would
feed on while she must still continue her dry suckling at his
lean chest.
in a week nicole forgot her flash about tommy—she had
not much memory for people and forgot them easily. but
in the first hot blast of june she heard he was in nice. he
wrote a little note to them both—and she opened it under
the parasol, together with other mail they had brought from
the house. after reading it she tossed it over to dick, and in
exchange he threw a telegram into the lap of her beach pajamas:
dears will be at gausses to-morrow unfortunately without
mother am counting on seeing you.
‘i’ll be glad to see her,’ said nicole, grimly.

but she went to the beach with dick next morning with
a renewal of her apprehension that dick was contriving at
some desperate solution. since the evening on golding’s
yacht she had sensed what was going on. so delicately balanced
was she between an old foothold that had always
guaranteed her security, and the imminence of a leap from
which she must alight changed in the very chemistry of
blood and muscle, that she did not dare bring the matter
into the true forefront of consciousness. the figures of
dick and herself, mutating, undefined, appeared as spooks
caught up into a fantastic dance. for months every word
had seemed to have an overtone of some other meaning,
soon to be resolved under circumstances that dick would
determine. though this state of mind was perhaps more
hopeful,—the long years of sheer being had had an enlivening
effect on the parts of her nature that early illness had
killed, that dick had not reached—through no fault of his
but simply because no one nature can extend entirely inside
another—it was still disquieting. the most unhappy aspect
of their relations was dick’s growing indifference, at present
personified by too much drink; nicole did not know whether
she was to be crushed or spared— dick’s voice, throbbing
with insincerity, confused the issue; she couldn’t guess how
he was going to behave next upon the tortuously slow un-
408 tender is the night
rolling of the carpet, nor what would happen at the end, at
the moment of the leap.
for what might occur thereafter she had no anxiety—
she suspected that that would be the lifting of a burden, an
unblinding of eyes. nicole had been designed for change,
for flight, with money as fins and wings. the new state of
things would be no more than if a racing chassis, concealed
for years under the body of a family limousine, should
be stripped to its original self. nicole could feel the fresh
breeze already—the wrench it was she feared, and the dark
manner of its coming.
the divers went out on the beach with her white suit and
his white trunks very white against the color of their bodies.
nicole saw dick peer about for the children among the
confused shapes and shadows of many umbrellas, and as his
mind temporarily left her, ceasing to grip her, she looked at
him with detachment, and decided that he was seeking his
children, not protectively but for protection. probably it was
the beach he feared, like a deposed ruler secretly visiting an
old court. she had come to hate his world with its delicate
jokes and politenesses, forgetting that for many years it was
the only world open to her. let him look at it— his beach,
perverted now to the tastes of the tasteless; he could search
it for a day and find no stone of the chinese wall he had
once erected around it, no footprint of an old friend.
for a moment nicole was sorry it was so; remembering
the glass he had raked out of the old trash heap, remembering
the sailor trunks and sweaters they had bought in a nice
back street—garments that afterward ran through a vogue 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 409
in silk among the paris couturiers, remembering the simple
little french girls climbing on the breakwaters crying ‘dites
donc! dites donc!’ like birds, and the ritual of the morning
time, the quiet restful extraversion toward sea and sun—
many inventions of his, buried deeper than the sand under
the span of so few years... .
now the swimming place was a ‘club,’ though, like the
international society it represented, it would be hard to say
who was not admitted.
nicole hardened again as dick knelt on the straw mat
and looked about for rosemary. her eyes followed his,
searching among the new paraphernalia, the trapezes over
the water, the swinging rings, the portable bathhouses, the
floating towers, the searchlights from last night’s fêtes, the
modernistic buffet, white with a hackneyed motif of endless
handlebars.
the water was almost the last place he looked for rosemary,
because few people swam any more in that blue
paradise, children and one exhibitionistic valet who punctuated
the morning with spectacular dives from a fifty-foot
rock—most of gausse’s guests stripped the concealing pajamas
from their flabbiness only for a short hangover dip at
one o’clock.
‘there she is,’ nicole remarked.
she watched dick’s eyes following rosemary’s track
from raft to raft; but the sigh that rocked out of her bosom
was something left over from five years ago.
‘let’s swim out and speak to rosemary,’ he suggested.
‘you go.’
410 tender is the night
‘we’ll both go.’ she struggled a moment against his
pronouncement, but eventually they swam out together,
tracing rosemary by the school of little fish who followed
her, taking their dazzle from her, the shining spoon of a
trout hook.
nicole stayed in the water while dick hoisted himself
up beside rosemary, and the two sat dripping and talking,
exactly as if they had never loved or touched each other.
rosemary was beautiful—her youth was a shock to nicole,
who rejoiced, however, that the young girl was less slender
by a hairline than herself. nicole swam around in little
rings, listening to rosemary who was acting amusement,
joy, and expectation—more confident than she had been
five years ago.
‘i miss mother so, but she’s meeting me in paris, monday.’
‘five years ago you came here,’ said dick. ‘and what
a funny little thing you were, in one of those hotel peignoirs!’
‘how you remember things! you always did—and always
the nice things.’
nicole saw the old game of flattery beginning again and
she dove under water, coming up again to hear:
‘i’m going to pretend it’s five years ago and i’m a girl of
eighteen again. you could always make me feel some you
know, kind of, you know, kind of happy way—you and nicole.
i feel as if you’re still on the beach there, under one of
those umbrellas—the nicest people i’d ever known, maybe
ever will.’

swimming away, nicole saw that the cloud of dick’s
heart-sickness had lifted a little as he began to play with
rosemary, bringing out his old expertness with people, a
tarnished object of art; she guessed that with a drink or so
he would have done his stunts on the swinging rings for her,
fumbling through stunts he had once done with ease. she
noticed that this summer, for the first time, he avoided high
diving.
later, as she dodged her way from raft to raft, dick overtook
her.
‘some of rosemary’s friends have a speed boat, the one
out there. do you want to aquaplane? i think it would be
amusing.’
remembering that once he could stand on his hands on
a chair at the end of a board, she indulged him as she might
have indulged lanier. last summer on the zugersee they
had played at that pleasant water game, and dick had lifted
a two-hundred-pound man from the board onto his shoulders
and stood up. but women marry all their husbands’
talents and naturally, afterwards, are not so impressed with
them as they may keep up the pretense of being. nicole had
not even pretended to be impressed, though she had said
‘yes’ to him, and ‘yes, i thought so too.’
she knew, though, that he was somewhat tired, that it
was only the closeness of rosemary’s exciting youth that
prompted the impending effort—she had seen him draw
the same inspiration from the new bodies of her children
and she wondered coldly if he would make a spectacle of
himself. the divers were older than the others in the boat—
412 tender is the night
the young people were polite, deferential, but nicole felt an
undercurrent of ‘who are these numbers anyhow?’ and she
missed dick’s easy talent of taking control of situations and
making them all right—he had concentrated on what he
was going to try to do.
the motor throttled down two hundred yards from
shore and one of the young men dove flat over the edge.
he swam at the aimless twisting board, steadied it, climbed
slowly to his knees on it— then got on his feet as the boat
accelerated. leaning back he swung his light vehicle ponderously
from side to side in slow, breathless arcs that rode
the trailing side-swell at the end of each swing. in the direct
wake of the boat he let go his rope, balanced for a moment,
then back-flipped into the water, disappearing like a statue
of glory, and reappearing as an insignificant head while the
boat made the circle back to him.
nicole refused her turn; then rosemary rode the board
neatly and conservatively, with facetious cheers from her
admirers. three of them scrambled egotistically for the
honor of pulling her into the boat, managing, among them,
to bruise her knee and hip against the side.
‘now you. doctor,’ said the mexican at the wheel.
dick and the last young man dove over the side and
swam to the board. dick was going to try his lifting trick
and nicole began to watch with smiling scorn. this physical
showing-off for rosemary irritated her most of all.
when the men had ridden long enough to find their balance,
dick knelt, and putting the back of his neck in the
other man’s crotch, found the rope through his legs, and 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 413
slowly began to rise.
the people in the boat, watching closely, saw that he was
having difficulties. he was on one knee; the trick was to
straighten all the way up in the same motion with which
he left his kneeling position. he rested for a moment, then
his face contracted as he put his heart into the strain, and
lifted.
the board was narrow, the man, though weighing less
than a hundred and fifty, was awkward with his weight and
grabbed clumsily at dick’s head. when, with a last wrenching
effort of his back, dick stood upright, the board slid
sidewise and the pair toppled into the sea.
in the boat rosemary exclaimed: ‘wonderful! they almost
had it.’
but as they came back to the swimmers nicole watched
for a sight of dick’s face. it was full of annoyance as she expected,
because he had done the thing with ease only two
years ago.
the second time he was more careful. he rose a little
testing the balance of his burden, settled down again on his
knee; then, grunting ‘alley oop!’ began to rise—but before
he could really straighten out, his legs suddenly buckled
and he shoved the board away with his feet to avoid being
struck as they fell off.
this time when the baby gar came back it was apparent
to all the passengers that he was angry.
‘do you mind if i try that once more?’ he called, treading
water. ‘we almost had it then.’
‘sure. go ahead.’
414 tender is the night
to nicole he looked white-around-the-gills, and she cautioned
him:
‘don’t you think that’s enough for now?’
he didn’t answer. the first partner had had plenty and
was hauled over the side, the mexican driving the motor
boat obligingly took his place.
he was heavier than the first man. as the boat gathered
motion, dick rested for a moment, belly-down on the
board. then he got beneath the man and took the rope, and
his muscles flexed as he tried to rise.
he could not rise. nicole saw him shift his position and
strain upward again but at the instant when the weight of
his partner was full upon his shoulders he became immovable.
he tried again— lifting an inch, two inches—nicole
felt the sweat glands of her forehead open as she strained
with him—then he was simply holding his ground, then he
collapsed back down on his knees with a smack, and they
went over, dick’s head barely missing a kick of the board.
‘hurry back!’ nicole called to the driver; even as she
spoke she saw him slide under water and she gave a little
cry; but he came up again and turned on his back, and
‘château’ swam near to help. it seemed forever till the boat
reached them but when they came alongside at last and nicole
saw dick floating exhausted and expressionless, alone
with the water and the sky, her panic changed suddenly to
contempt.
‘we’ll help you up, doctor... . get his foot ... all right ...
now altogether... .’
dick sat panting and looking at nothing.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 415
‘i knew you shouldn’t have tried it,’ nicole could not help
saying.
‘he’d tired himself the first two times,’ said the mexican.
‘it was a foolish thing,’ nicole insisted. rosemary tactfully
said nothing.
after a minute dick got his breath, panting, ‘i couldn’t
have lifted a paper doll that time.’
an explosive little laugh relieved the tension caused by
his failure. they were all attentive to dick as he disembarked
at the dock. but nicole was annoyed—everything
he did annoyed her now.
she sat with rosemary under an umbrella while dick
went to the buffet for a drink—he returned presently with
some sherry for them.
‘the first drink i ever had was with you,’ rosemary said,
and with a spurt of enthusiasm she added, ‘oh, i’m so glad
to see you and know you’re all right. i was worried—‘ her
sentence broke as she changed direction ‘that maybe you
wouldn’t be.’
‘did you hear i’d gone into a process of deterioration?’
‘oh, no. i simply—just heard you’d changed. and i’m
glad to see with my own eyes it isn’t true.’
‘it is true,’ dick answered, sitting down with them. ‘the
change came a long way back—but at first it didn’t show.
the manner remains intact for some time after the morale
cracks.’
‘do you practise on the riviera?’ rosemary demanded
hastily.
416 tender is the night
‘it’d be a good ground to find likely specimens.’ he
nodded here and there at the people milling about in the
golden sand. ‘great candidates. notice our old friend, mrs.
abrams, playing duchess to mary north’s queen? don’t get
jealous about it—think of mrs. abram’s long climb up the
back stairs of the ritz on her hands and knees and all the
carpet dust she had to inhale.’
rosemary interrupted him. ‘but is that really mary
north?’ she was regarding a woman sauntering in their direction
followed by a small group who behaved as if they
were accustomed to being looked at. when they were ten
feet away, mary’s glance flickered fractionally over the divers,
one of those unfortunate glances that indicate to the
glanced-upon that they have been observed but are to be
overlooked, the sort of glance that neither the divers nor
rosemary hoyt had ever permitted themselves to throw at
any one in their lives. dick was amused when mary perceived
rosemary, changed her plans and came over. she
spoke to nicole with pleasant heartiness, nodded unsmilingly
to dick as if he were somewhat contagious—whereupon
he bowed in ironic respect—as she greeted rosemary.
‘i heard you were here. for how long?’
‘until to-morrow,’ rosemary answered.
she, too, saw how mary had walked through the divers
to talk to her, and a sense of obligation kept her unenthusiastic.
no, she could not dine to-night.
mary turned to nicole, her manner indicating affection
blended with pity.
‘how are the children?’ she asked.
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 417
they came up at the moment, and nicole gave ear to
a request that she overrule the governess on a swimming
point.
‘no,’ dick answered for her. ‘what mademoiselle says
must go.’
agreeing that one must support delegated authority, nicole
refused their request, whereupon mary—who in the
manner of an anita loos’ heroine had dealings only with
faits accomplis, who indeed could not have house-broken
a french poodle puppy—regarded dick as though he were
guilty of a most flagrant bullying. dick, chafed by the tiresome
performance, inquired with mock solicitude:
‘how are your children—and their aunts?’
mary did not answer; she left them, first draping a sympathetic
hand over lanier’s reluctant head. after she had
gone dick said: ‘when i think of the time i spent working
over her.’
‘i like her,’ said nicole.
dick’s bitterness had surprised rosemary, who had
thought of him as all-forgiving, all-comprehending. suddenly
she recalled what it was she had heard about him. in
conversation with some state department people on the
boat,—europeanized americans who had reached a position
where they could scarcely have been said to belong
to any nation at all, at least not to any great power though
perhaps to a balkan-like state composed of similar citizens—the
name of the ubiquitously renowned baby warren
had occurred and it was remarked that baby’s younger sister
had thrown herself away on a dissipated doctor. ‘he’s not 
418 tender is the night
received anywhere any more,’ the woman said.
the phrase disturbed rosemary, though she could not
place the divers as living in any relation to society where
such a fact, if fact it was, could have any meaning, yet the
hint of a hostile and organized public opinion rang in her
ears. ‘he’s not received anywhere any more.’ she pictured
dick climbing the steps of a mansion, presenting cards and
being told by a butler: ‘we’re not receiving you any more”;
then proceeding down an avenue only to be told the same
thing by the countless other butlers of countless ambassadors,
ministers, chargés d’affaires... .
nicole wondered how she could get away. she guessed
that dick, stung into alertness, would grow charming and
would make rosemary respond to him. sure enough, in a
moment his voice managed to qualify everything unpleasant
he had said:
‘mary’s all right—she’s done very well. but it’s hard to go
on liking people who don’t like you.’
rosemary, falling into line, swayed toward dick and
crooned:
‘oh, you’re so nice. i can’t imagine anybody not forgiving
you anything, no matter what you did to them.’ then feeling
that her exuberance had transgressed on nicole’s rights,
she looked at the sand exactly between them: ‘i wanted to
ask you both what you thought of my latest pictures—if you
saw them.’
nicole said nothing, having seen one of them and
thought little about it.
‘it’ll take a few minutes to tell you,’ dick said. ‘let’s sup-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 419
pose that nicole says to you that lanier is ill. what do you
do in life? what does anyone do? they act—face, voice,
words—the face shows sorrow, the voice shows shock, the
words show sympathy.’
‘yes—i understand.’
‘but in the theatre, no. in the theatre all the best comediennes
have built up their reputations by burlesquing the
correct emotional responses—fear and love and sympathy.’
‘i see.’ yet she did not quite see.
losing the thread of it, nicole’s impatience increased as
dick continued:
‘the danger to an actress is in responding. again, let’s
suppose that somebody told you, ‘your lover is dead.’ in life
you’d probably go to pieces. but on the stage you’re trying to
entertain—the audience can do the ‘responding’ for themselves.
first the actress has lines to follow, then she has to
get the audience’s attention back on herself, away from the
murdered chinese or whatever the thing is. so she must do
something unexpected. if the audience thinks the character
is hard she goes soft on them—if they think she’s soft she
goes hard. you go all out of character—you understand?’
‘i don’t quite,’ admitted rosemary. ‘how do you mean
out of character?’
‘you do the unexpected thing until you’ve manoeuvred
the audience back from the objective fact to yourself. then
you slide into character again.’
nicole could stand no more. she stood up sharply, making
no attempt to conceal her impatience. rosemary, who
had been for a few minutes half-conscious of this, turned in 
420 tender is the night
a conciliatory way to topsy.
‘would you like to be an actress when you grow up? i
think you’d make a fine actress.’
nicole stared at her deliberately and in her grandfather’s
voice said, slow and distinct:
‘it’s absolutely out to put such ideas in the heads of other
people’s children. remember, we may have quite different
plans for them.’ she turned sharply to dick. ‘i’m going to
take the car home. i’ll send michelle for you and the children.’
‘you haven’t driven for months,’ he protested.
‘i haven’t forgotten how.’
without a glance at rosemary whose face was ‘responding’
violently, nicole left the umbrella.
in the bathhouse, she changed to pajamas, her expression
still hard as a plaque. but as she turned into the road of
arched pines and the atmosphere changed,—with a squirrel’s
flight on a branch, a wind nudging at the leaves, a cock
splitting distant air, with a creep of sunlight transpiring
through the immobility, then the voices of the beach receded—nicole
relaxed and felt new and happy; her thoughts
were clear as good bells—she had a sense of being cured and
in a new way. her ego began blooming like a great rich rose
as she scrambled back along the labyrinths in which she had
wandered for years. she hated the beach, resented the places
where she had played planet to dick’s sun.
‘why, i’m almost complete,’ she thought. ‘i’m practically
standing alone, without him.’ and like a happy child,
wanting the completion as soon as possible, and knowing 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 421
vaguely that dick had planned for her to have it, she lay on
her bed as soon as she got home and wrote tommy barban
in nice a short provocative letter.
but that was for the daytime—toward evening with the
inevitable diminution of nervous energy, her spirits flagged,
and the arrows flew a little in the twilight. she was afraid of
what was in dick’s mind; again she felt that a plan underlay
his current actions and she was afraid of his plans—they
worked well and they had an all-inclusive logic about them
which nicole was not able to command. she had somehow
given over the thinking to him, and in his absences her every
action seemed automatically governed by what he would
like, so that now she felt inadequate to match her intentions
against his. yet think she must; she knew at last the number
on the dreadful door of fantasy, the threshold to the escape
that was no escape; she knew that for her the greatest sin
now and in the future was to delude herself. it had been a
long lesson but she had learned it. either you think—or else
others have to think for you and take power from you, pervert
and discipline your natural tastes, civilize and sterilize
you.
they had a tranquil supper with dick drinking much
beer and being cheerful with the children in the dusky
room. afterward he played some schubert songs and some
new jazz from america that nicole hummed in her harsh,
sweet contralto over his shoulder.
“thank y’ father-r
thank y’ mother-r
422 tender is the night
thanks for meetingup with one another—‘
‘i don’t like that one,’ dick said, starting to turn the
page.
‘oh, play it!’ she exclaimed. ‘am i going through the rest
of life flinching at the word ‘father’?’
’—thank the horse that pulled the buggy that night!
thank you both for being justabit tight—‘
later they sat with the children on the moorish roof and
watched the fireworks of two casinos, far apart, far down
on the shore. it was lonely and sad to be so empty-hearted
toward each other.
next morning, back from shopping in cannes, nicole
found a note saying that dick had taken the small car and
gone up into provence for a few days by himself. even as she
read it the phone rang—it was tommy barban from monte
carlo, saying that he had received her letter and was driving
over. she felt her lips’ warmth in the receiver as she welcomed
his coming.

she bathed and anointed herself and covered her body
with a layer of powder, while her toes crunched another pile
on a bath towel. she looked microscopically at the lines of
her flanks, wondering how soon the fine, slim edifice would
begin to sink squat and earthward. in about six years, but
now i’ll do—in fact i’ll do as well as any one i know.
she was not exaggerating. the only physical disparity between
nicole at present and the nicole of five years before
was simply that she was no longer a young girl. but she was
enough ridden by the current youth worship, the moving
pictures with their myriad faces of girl-children, blandly
represented as carrying on the work and wisdom of the
world, to feel a jealousy of youth.
she put on the first ankle-length day dress that she had
owned for many years, and crossed herself reverently with
chanel sixteen. when tommy drove up at one o’clock she
had made her person into the trimmest of gardens.
how good to have things like this, to be worshipped
again, to pretend to have a mystery! she had lost two of the
great arrogant years in the life of a pretty girl—now she felt
like making up for them; she greeted tommy as if he were
one of many men at her feet, walking ahead of him instead
of beside him as they crossed the garden toward the market
umbrella. attractive women of nineteen and of twenty-nine 
424 tender is the night
are alike in their breezy confidence; on the contrary, the exigent
womb of the twenties does not pull the outside world
centripetally around itself. the former are ages of insolence,
comparable the one to a young cadet, the other to a fighter
strutting after combat.
but whereas a girl of nineteen draws her confidence from
a surfeit of attention, a woman of twenty-nine is nourished
on subtler stuff. desirous, she chooses her apéritifs wisely,
or, content, she enjoys the caviare of potential power.
happily she does not seem, in either case, to anticipate the
subsequent years when her insight will often be blurred by
panic, by the fear of stopping or the fear of going on. but on
the landings of nineteen or twenty-nine she is pretty sure
that there are no bears in the hall.
nicole did not want any vague spiritual romance—
she wanted an ‘affair”; she wanted a change. she realized,
thinking with dick’s thoughts, that from a superficial view
it was a vulgar business to enter, without emotion, into an
indulgence that menaced all of them. on the other hand,
she blamed dick for the immediate situation, and honestly
thought that such an experiment might have a therapeutic
value. all summer she had been stimulated by watching
people do exactly what they were tempted to do and pay no
penalty for it—moreover, in spite of her intention of no longer
lying to herself, she preferred to consider that she was
merely feeling her way and that at any moment she could
withdraw... .
in the light shade tommy caught her up in his whiteduck
arms and pulled her around to him, looking at her 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 425
eyes.
‘don’t move,’ he said. ‘i’m going to look at you a great
deal from now on.’
there was some scent on his hair, a faint aura of soap
from his white clothes. her lips were tight, not smiling and
they both simply looked for a moment.
‘do you like what you see?’ she murmured.
‘parle français.’
‘very well,’ and she asked again in french. ‘do you like
what you see?’
he pulled her closer.
‘i like whatever i see about you.’ he hesitated. ‘i thought
i knew your face but it seems there are some things i didn’t
know about it. when did you begin to have white crook’s
eyes?’
she broke away, shocked and indignant, and cried in
english:
‘is that why you wanted to talk french?’ her voice quieted
as the butler came with sherry. ‘so you could be offensive
more accurately?’
she parked her small seat violently on the cloth-of-silver
chair cushion.
‘i have no mirror here,’ she said, again in french, but decisively,
‘but if my eyes have changed it’s because i’m well
again. and being well perhaps i’ve gone back to my true
self—i suppose my grandfather was a crook and i’m a crook
by heritage, so there we are. does that satisfy your logical
mind?’
he scarcely seemed to know what she was talking 
426 tender is the night
about.
‘where’s dick—is he lunching with us?’
seeing that his remark had meant comparatively little to
him she suddenly laughed away its effect.
‘dick’s on a tour,’ she said. ‘rosemary hoyt turned up,
and either they’re together or she upset him so much that he
wants to go away and dream about her.’
‘you know, you’re a little complicated after all.’
‘oh no,’ she assured him hastily. ‘no, i’m not really—i’m
just a— i’m just a whole lot of different simple people.’
marius brought out melon and an ice pail, and nicole,
thinking irresistibly about her crook’s eyes did not answer;
he gave one an entire nut to crack, this man, instead of giving
it in fragments to pick at for meat.
‘why didn’t they leave you in your natural state?’ tommy
demanded presently. ‘you are the most dramatic person
i have known.’
she had no answer.
‘all this taming of women!’ he scoffed.
‘in any society there are certain—‘ she felt dick’s ghost
prompting at her elbow but she subsided at tommy’s overtone:
‘i’ve brutalized many men into shape but i wouldn’t take
a chance on half the number of women. especially this
‘kind’ bullying—what good does it do anybody?—you or
him or anybody?’
her heart leaped and then sank faintly with a sense of
what she owed dick.
‘i suppose i’ve got—‘
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 427
‘you’ve got too much money,’ he said impatiently. ‘that’s
the crux of the matter. dick can’t beat that.’
she considered while the melons were removed.
‘what do you think i ought to do?’
for the first time in ten years she was under the sway of
a personality other than her husband’s. everything tommy
said to her became part of her forever.
they drank the bottle of wine while a faint wind rocked
the pine needles and the sensuous heat of early afternoon
made blinding freckles on the checkered luncheon cloth.
tommy came over behind her and laid his arms along hers,
clasping her hands. their cheeks touched and then their lips
and she gasped half with passion for him, half with the sudden
surprise of its force... .
‘can’t you send the governess and the children away for
the afternoon?’
‘they have a piano lesson. anyhow i don’t want to stay
here.’
‘kiss me again.’
a little later, riding toward nice, she thought: so i have
white crook’s eyes, have i? very well then, better a sane
crook than a mad puritan.
his assertion seemed to absolve her from all blame or
responsibility and she had a thrill of delight in thinking of
herself in a new way. new vistas appeared ahead, peopled
with the faces of many men, none of whom she need obey
or even love. she drew in her breath, hunched her shoulders
with a wriggle and turned to tommy.
‘have we got to go all the way to your hotel at monte 
428 tender is the night
carlo?’
he brought the car to a stop with a squeak of tires.
‘no!’ he answered. ‘and, my god, i have never been so
happy as i am this minute.’
they had passed through nice following the blue coast
and begun to mount to the middling-high corniche. now
tommy turned sharply down to the shore, ran out a blunt
peninsula, and stopped in the rear of a small shore hotel.
its tangibility frightened nicole for a moment. at the
desk an american was arguing interminably with the clerk
about the rate of exchange. she hovered, outwardly tranquil
but inwardly miserable, as tommy filled out the police
blanks—his real, hers false. their room was a mediterranean
room, almost ascetic, almost clean, darkened to the
glare of the sea. simplest of pleasures—simplest of places.
tommy ordered two cognacs, and when the door closed behind
the waiter, he sat in the only chair, dark, scarred and
handsome, his eyebrows arched and upcurling, a fighting
puck, an earnest satan.
before they had finished the brandy they suddenly
moved together and met standing up; then they were sitting
on the bed and he kissed her hardy knees. struggling a little
still, like a decapitated animal she forgot about dick and her
new white eyes, forgot tommy himself and sank deeper and
deeper into the minutes and the moment.
... when he got up to open a shutter and find out what
caused the increasing clamor below their windows, his figure
was darker and stronger than dick’s, with high lights
along the rope-twists of muscle. momentarily he had for-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 429
gotten her too—almost in the second of his flesh breaking
from hers she had a foretaste that things were going to be
different than she had expected. she felt the nameless fear
which precedes all emotions, joyous or sorrowful, inevitable
as a hum of thunder precedes a storm.
tommy peered cautiously from the balcony and reported.
‘all i can see is two women on the balcony below this.
they’re talking about weather and tipping back and forth in
american rocking-chairs.’
‘making all that noise?’
‘the noise is coming from somewhere below them. listen.’
“oh, way down south in the land of cotton
hotels bum and business rotten
look away—‘
‘it’s americans.’
nicole flung her arms wide on the bed and stared at the
ceiling; the powder had dampened on her to make a milky
surface. she liked the bareness of the room, the sound of the
single fly navigating overhead. tommy brought the chair
over to the bed and swept the clothes off it to sit down; she
liked the economy of the weightless dress and espadrilles
that mingled with his ducks upon the floor.
he inspected the oblong white torso joined abruptly to
the brown limbs and head, and said, laughing gravely:
‘you are all new like a baby.’
430 tender is the night
‘with white eyes.’
‘i’ll take care of that.’
‘it’s very hard taking care of white eyes—especially the
ones made in chicago.’
‘i know all the old languedoc peasant remedies.’
‘kiss me, on the lips, tommy.’
‘that’s so american,’ he said, kissing her nevertheless.
‘when i was in america last there were girls who would tear
you apart with their lips, tear themselves too, until their faces
were scarlet with the blood around the lips all brought
out in a patch—but nothing further.’
nicole leaned up on one elbow.
‘i like this room,’ she said.
‘i find it somewhat meagre. darling, i’m glad you
wouldn’t wait until we got to monte carlo.’
‘why only meagre? why, this is a wonderful room,
tommy—like the bare tables in so many cézannes and picassos.’
‘i don’t know.’ he did not try to understand her. ‘there’s
that noise again. my god, has there been a murder?’
he went to the window and reported once more:
‘it seems to be two american sailors fighting and a lot
more cheering them on. they are from your battleship off
shore.’ he wrapped a towel around himself and went farther
out on the balcony. ‘they have poules with them. i
have heard about this now—the women follow them from
place to place wherever the ship goes. but what women! one
would think with their pay they could find better women!
why the women who followed korniloff! why we never 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 431
looked at anything less than a ballerina!’
nicole was glad he had known so many women, so that
the word itself meant nothing to him; she would be able to
hold him so long as the person in her transcended the universals
of her body.
‘hit him where it hurts!’
‘yah-h-h-h!’
‘hey, what i tell you get inside that right!’
‘come on, dulschmit, you son!’
‘yaa-yaa!’
‘ya-yeh-yah!’
tommy turned away.
‘this place seems to have outlived its usefulness, you
agree?’
she agreed, but they clung together for a moment before
dressing, and then for a while longer it seemed as good
enough a palace as any... .
dressing at last tommy exclaimed:
‘my god, those two women in the rocking-chairs on
the balcony below us haven’t moved. they’re trying to talk
this matter out of existence. they’re here on an economical
holiday, and all the american navy and all the whores in
europe couldn’t spoil it.’
he came over gently and surrounded her, pulling the
shoulder strap of her slip into place with his teeth; then a
sound split the air outside: cr-ack—boom-m-m-m! it
was the battleship sounding a recall.
now, down below their window, it was pandemonium
indeed—for the boat was moving to shores as yet 
432 tender is the night
unannounced. waiters called accounts and demanded
settlements in impassioned voices, there were oaths and denials;
the tossing of bills too large and change too small;
passouts were assisted to the boats, and the voices of the
naval police chopped with quick commands through all
voices. there were cries, tears, shrieks, promises as the first
launch shoved off and the women crowded forward on the
wharf, screaming and waving.
tommy saw a girl rush out upon the balcony below waving
a napkin, and before he could see whether or not the
rocking englishwomen gave in at last and acknowledged
her presence, there was a knock at their own door. outside,
excited female voices made them agree to unlock it, disclosing
two girls, young, thin and barbaric, unfound rather
than lost, in the hall. one of them wept chokingly.
‘kwee wave off your porch?’ implored the other in passionate
american. ‘kwee please? wave at the boy friends?
kwee, please. the other rooms is all locked.’
‘with pleasure,’ tommy said.
the girls rushed out on the balcony and presently their
voices struck a loud treble over the din.
‘‘by, charlie! charlie, look up!’
‘send a wire gen’al alivery nice!’
‘charlie! he don’t see me.’
one of the girls hoisted her skirt suddenly, pulled and
ripped at her pink step-ins and tore them to a sizable flag;
then, screaming ‘ben! ben!’ she waved it wildly. as tommy
and nicole left the room it still fluttered against the blue
sky. oh, say can you see the tender color of remembered 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 433
flesh?—while at the stern of the battleship arose in rivalry
the star-spangled banner.
they dined at the new beach casino at monte carlo ...
much later they swam in beaulieu in a roofless cavern of
white moonlight formed by a circlet of pale boulders about
a cup of phosphorescent water, facing monaco and the blur
of mentone. she liked his bringing her there to the eastward
vision and the novel tricks of wind and water; it was all as
new as they were to each other. symbolically she lay across
his saddle-bow as surely as if he had wolfed her away from
damascus and they had come out upon the mongolian
plain. moment by moment all that dick had taught her fell
away and she was ever nearer to what she had been in the
beginning, prototype of that obscure yielding up of swords
that was going on in the world about her. tangled with love
in the moonlight she welcomed the anarchy of her lover.
they awoke together finding the moon gone down and
the air cool. she struggled up demanding the time and
tommy called it roughly at three.
‘i’ve got to go home then.’
‘i thought we’d sleep in monte carlo.’
‘no. there’s a governess and the children. i’ve got to roll
in before daylight.’
‘as you like.’
they dipped for a second, and when he saw her shivering
he rubbed her briskly with a towel. as they got into the car
with their heads still damp, their skins fresh and glowing,
they were loath to start back. it was very bright where they
were and as tommy kissed her she felt him losing himself 
434 tender is the night
in the whiteness of her cheeks and her white teeth and her
cool brow and the hand that touched his face. still attuned
to dick, she waited for interpretation or qualification; but
none was forthcoming. reassured sleepily and happily that
none would be, she sank low in the seat and drowsed until
the sound of the motor changed and she felt them climbing
toward villa diana. at the gate she kissed him an almost
automatic good-by. the sound of her feet on the walk was
changed, the night noises of the garden were suddenly in
the past but she was glad, none the less, to be back. the day
had progressed at a staccato rate, and in spite of its satisfactions
she was not habituated to such strain.

ix
at four o’clock next afternoon a station taxi stopped at
the gate and dick got out. suddenly off balance, nicole ran
from the terrace to meet him, breathless with her effort at
self-control.
‘where’s the car?’ she asked.
‘i left it in arles. i didn’t feel like driving any more.’
‘i thought from your note that you’d be several days.’
‘i ran into a mistral and some rain.’
‘did you have fun?’
‘just as much fun as anybody has running away from
things. i drove rosemary as far as avignon and put her on
her train there.’ they walked toward the terrace together,
where he deposited his bag. ‘i didn’t tell you in the note because
i thought you’d imagine a lot of things.’
‘that was very considerate of you.’ nicole felt surer of
herself now.
‘i wanted to find out if she had anything to offer—the
only way was to see her alone.’
‘did she have—anything to offer?’
‘rosemary didn’t grow up,’ he answered. ‘it’s probably
better that way. what have you been doing?’
she felt her face quiver like a rabbit’s.
‘i went dancing last night—with tommy barban. we
went—‘
436 tender is the night
he winced, interrupting her.
‘don’t tell me about it. it doesn’t matter what you do,
only i don’t want to know anything definitely.’
‘there isn’t anything to know.’
‘all right, all right.’ then as if he had been away a week:
‘how are the children?’
the phone rang in the house.
‘if it’s for me i’m not home,’ said dick turning away
quickly. ‘i’ve got some things to do over in the work-room.’
nicole waited till he was out of sight behind the well;
then she went into the house and took up the phone.
‘nicole, comment vas-tu?’
‘dick’s home.’
he groaned.
‘meet me here in cannes,’ he suggested. ‘i’ve got to talk
to you.’
‘i can’t.’
‘tell me you love me.’ without speaking she nodded at
the receiver; he repeated, ‘tell me you love me.’
‘oh, i do,’ she assured him. ‘but there’s nothing to be
done right now.’
‘of course there is,’ he said impatiently. ‘dick sees it’s
over between you two—it’s obvious he has quit. what does
he expect you to do?’
‘i don’t know. i’ll have to—‘ she stopped herself from
saying ‘—to wait until i can ask dick,’ and instead finished
with: ‘i’ll write and i’ll phone you to-morrow.’
she wandered about the house rather contentedly, resting
on her achievement. she was a mischief, and that was a 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 437
satisfaction; no longer was she a huntress of corralled game.
yesterday came back to her now in innumerable detail—
detail that began to overlay her memory of similar moments
when her love for dick was fresh and intact. she began to
slight that love, so that it seemed to have been tinged with
sentimental habit from the first. with the opportunistic
memory of women she scarcely recalled how she had felt
when she and dick had possessed each other in secret places
around the corners of the world, during the month before
they were married. just so had she lied to tommy last night,
swearing to him that never before had she so entirely, so
completely, so utterly... .
... then remorse for this moment of betrayal, which so
cavalierly belittled a decade of her life, turned her walk toward
dick’s sanctuary.
approaching noiselessly she saw him behind his cottage,
sitting in a steamer chair by the cliff wall, and for a moment
she regarded him silently. he was thinking, he was living a
world completely his own and in the small motions of his
face, the brow raised or lowered, the eyes narrowed or widened,
the lips set and reset, the play of his hands, she saw
him progress from phase to phase of his own story spinning
out inside him, his own, not hers. once he clenched
his fists and leaned forward, once it brought into his face
an expression of torment and despair—when this passed its
stamp lingered in his eyes. for almost the first time in her
life she was sorry for him—it is hard for those who have
once been mentally afflicted to be sorry for those who are
well, and though nicole often paid lip service to the fact 
438 tender is the night
that he had led her back to the world she had forfeited, she
had thought of him really as an inexhaustible energy, incapable
of fatigue—she forgot the troubles she caused him at
the moment when she forgot the troubles of her own that
had prompted her. that he no longer controlled her—did he
know that? had he willed it all?—she felt as sorry for him as
she had sometimes felt for abe north and his ignoble destiny,
sorry as for the helplessness of infants and the old.
she went up putting her arm around his shoulder and
touching their heads together said:
‘don’t be sad.’
he looked at her coldly.
‘don’t touch me!’ he said.
confused she moved a few feet away.
‘excuse me,’ he continued abstractedly. ‘i was just thinking
what i thought of you—‘
‘why not add the new classification to your book?’
‘i have thought of it—‘furthermore and beyond the psychoses
and the neuroses—‘’
‘i didn’t come over here to be disagreeable.’
‘then why did you come, nicole? i can’t do anything for
you any more. i’m trying to save myself.’
‘from my contamination?’
‘profession throws me in contact with questionable company
sometimes.’
she wept with anger at the abuse.
‘you’re a coward! you’ve made a failure of your life, and
you want to blame it on me.’
while he did not answer she began to feel the old hypno-
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 439
tism of his intelligence, sometimes exercised without power
but always with substrata of truth under truth which she
could not break or even crack. again she struggled with it,
fighting him with her small, fine eyes, with the plush arrogance
of a top dog, with her nascent transference to another
man, with the accumulated resentment of years; she fought
him with her money and her faith that her sister disliked
him and was behind her now; with the thought of the new
enemies he was making with his bitterness, with her quick
guile against his wine-ing and dine-ing slowness, her health
and beauty against his physical deterioration, her unscrupulousness
against his moralities—for this inner battle she
used even her weaknesses— fighting bravely and courageously
with the old cans and crockery and bottles, empty
receptacles of her expiated sins, outrages, mistakes. and
suddenly, in the space of two minutes she achieved her victory
and justified herself to herself without lie or subterfuge,
cut the cord forever. then she walked, weak in the legs, and
sobbing coolly, toward the household that was hers at last.
dick waited until she was out of sight. then he leaned his
head forward on the parapet. the case was finished. doctor
diver was at liberty.
440 tender is the night
x
at two o’clock that night the phone woke nicole and she
heard dick answer it from what they called the restless bed,
in the next room.
‘oui, oui ... mais à qui est-ce-que je parle? ... oui ...’ his
voice woke up with surprise. ‘but can i speak to one of the
ladies, sir the officer? they are both ladies of the very highest
prominence, ladies of connections that might cause
political complications of the most serious... . it is a fact, i
swear to you... . very well, you will see.’
he got up and, as he absorbed the situation, his selfknowledge
assured him that he would undertake to deal
with it—the old fatal pleasingness, the old forceful charm,
swept back with its cry of ‘use me!’ he would have to go fix
this thing that he didn’t care a damn about, because it had
early become a habit to be loved, perhaps from the moment
when he had realized that he was the last hope of a decaying
clan. on an almost parallel occasion, back in dohmler’s
clinic on the zurichsee, realizing this power, he had made
his choice, chosen ophelia, chosen the sweet poison and
drunk it. wanting above all to be brave and kind, he had
wanted, even more than that, to be loved. so it had been. so
it would ever be, he saw, simultaneously with the slow archaic
tinkle from the phone box as he rang off.
there was a long pause. nicole called, ‘what is it? who 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 441
is it?’
dick had begun to dress even as he hung up the phone.
‘it’s the poste de police in antibes—they’re holding mary
north and that sibley-biers. it’s something serious—the
agent wouldn’t tell me; he kept saying ‘pas de mortes—pas
d’automobiles’ but he implied it was just about everything
else.’
‘why on earth did they call on you? it sounds very peculiar
to me.’
‘they’ve got to get out on bail to save their faces; and
only some property owner in the alpes maritimes can give
bail.’
‘they had their nerve.’
‘i don’t mind. however i’ll pick up gausse at the hotel—‘
nicole stayed awake after he had departed wondering
what offense they could have committed; then she slept. a
little after three when dick came in she sat up stark awake
saying, ‘what?’ as if to a character in her dream.
‘it was an extraordinary story—‘ dick said. he sat on the
foot of her bed, telling her how he had roused old gausse
from an alsatian coma, told him to clean out his cash drawer,
and driven with him to the police station.
‘i don’t like to do something for that anglaise,’ gausse
grumbled.
mary north and lady caroline, dressed in the costume
of french sailors, lounged on a bench outside the two dingy
cells. the latter had the outraged air of a briton who momentarily
expected the mediterranean fleet to steam up to 
442 tender is the night
her assistance. mary minghetti was in a condition of panic
and collapse—she literally flung herself at dick’s stomach
as though that were the point of greatest association, imploring
him to do something. meanwhile the chief of police
explained the matter to gausse who listened to each word
with reluctance, divided between being properly appreciative
of the officer’s narrative gift and showing that, as the
perfect servant, the story had no shocking effect on him. ‘it
was merely a lark,’ said lady caroline with scorn. ‘we were
pretending to be sailors on leave, and we picked up two silly
girls. they got the wind up and made a rotten scene in a
lodging house.’
dick nodded gravely, looking at the stone floor, like a
priest in the confessional—he was torn between a tendency
to ironic laughter and another tendency to order fifty
stripes of the cat and a fortnight of bread and water. the
lack, in lady caroline’s face, of any sense of evil, except the
evil wrought by cowardly provençal girls and stupid police,
confounded him; yet he had long concluded that certain
classes of english people lived upon a concentrated essence
of the anti-social that, in comparison, reduced the gorgings
of new york to something like a child contracting indigestion
from ice cream.
‘i’ve got to get out before hosain hears about this,’ mary
pleaded. ‘dick, you can always arrange things—you always
could. tell ‘em we’ll go right home, tell ‘em we’ll pay anything.’
‘i shall not,’ said lady caroline disdainfully. ‘not a shilling.
but i shall jolly well find out what the consulate in 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 443
cannes has to say about this.’
‘no, no!’ insisted mary. ‘we’ve got to get out to-night.’
‘i’ll see what i can do,’ said dick, and added, ‘but money
will certainly have to change hands.’ looking at them as
though they were the innocents that he knew they were not,
he shook his head: ‘of all the crazy stunts!’
lady caroline smiled complacently.
‘you’re an insanity doctor, aren’t you? you ought to be
able to help us—and gausse has got to!’
at this point dick went aside with gausse and talked
over the old man’s findings. the affair was more serious than
had been indicated—one of the girls whom they had picked
up was of a respectable family. the family were furious, or
pretended to be; a settlement would have to be made with
them. the other one, a girl of the port, could be more easily
dealt with. there were french statutes that would make
conviction punishable by imprisonment or, at the very least,
public expulsion from the country. in addition to the difficulties,
there was a growing difference in tolerance between
such townspeople as benefited by the foreign colony and the
ones who were annoyed by the consequent rise of prices.
gausse, having summarized the situation, turned it over to
dick. dick called the chief of police into conference.
‘now you know that the french government wants to encourage
american touring—so much so that in paris this
summer there’s an order that americans can’t be arrested
except for the most serious offenses.’
‘this is serious enough, my god.’
‘but look now—you have their cartes d’identité?’
444 tender is the night
‘they had none. they had nothing—two hundred francs
and some rings. not even shoe-laces that they could have
hung themselves with!’
relieved that there had been no cartes d’identité dick
continued.
‘the italian countess is still an american citizen. she
is the grand-daughter—‘ he told a string of lies slowly and
portentously, ‘of john d. rockefeller mellon. you have
heard of him?’
‘yes, oh heavens, yes. you mistake me for a nobody?’
‘in addition she is the niece of lord henry ford and so
connected with the renault and citroën companies—‘ he
thought he had better stop here. however the sincerity of
his voice had begun to affect the officer, so he continued:
‘to arrest her is just as if you arrested a great royalty of england.
it might mean—war!’
‘but how about the englishwoman?’
‘i’m coming to that. she is affianced to the brother of the
prince of wales—the duke of buckingham.’
‘she will be an exquisite bride for him.’
‘now we are prepared to give—‘ dick calculated quickly,
‘one thousand francs to each of the girls—and an additional
thousand to the father of the ‘serious’ one. also two thousand
in addition, for you to distribute as you think best—‘
he shrugged his shoulders, ‘—among the men who made
the arrest, the lodging-house keeper and so forth. i shall
hand you the five thousand and expect you to do the negotiating
immediately. then they can be released on bail on
some charge like disturbing the peace, and whatever fine 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 445
there is will be paid before the magistrate tomorrow—by
messenger.’
before the officer spoke dick saw by his expression that it
would be all right. the man said hesitantly, ‘i have made no
entry because they have no cartes d’identité. i must see—
give me the money.’
an hour later dick and m. gausse dropped the women
by the majestic hotel, where lady caroline’s chauffeur slept
in her landaulet.
‘remember,’ said dick, ‘you owe monsieur gausse a hundred
dollars a piece.’
‘all right,’ mary agreed, ‘i’ll give him a check to-morrow—and
something more.’
‘not i!’ startled, they all turned to lady caroline, who,
now entirely recovered, was swollen with righteousness.
‘the whole thing was an outrage. by no means did i authorize
you to give a hundred dollars to those people.’
little gausse stood beside the car, his eyes blazing suddenly.
‘you won’t pay me?’
‘of course she will,’ said dick.
suddenly the abuse that gausse had once endured as a
bus boy in london flamed up and he walked through the
moonlight up to lady caroline.
he whipped a string of condemnatory words about her,
and as she turned away with a frozen laugh, he took a step
after her and swiftly planted his little foot in the most celebrated
of targets. lady caroline, taken by surprise, flung up
her hands like a person shot as her sailor-clad form sprawled 
446 tender is the night
forward on the sidewalk.
dick’s voice cut across her raging: ‘mary, you quiet her
down! or you’ll both be in leg-irons in ten minutes!’
on the way back to the hotel old gausse said not a word,
until they passed the juan-les-pins casino, still sobbing and
coughing with jazz; then he sighed forth:
‘i have never seen women like this sort of women. i have
known many of the great courtesans of the world, and for
them i have much respect often, but women like these women
i have never seen before.’

dick and nicole were accustomed to go together to the
barber, and have haircuts and shampoos in adjoining rooms.
from dick’s side nicole could hear the snip of shears, the
count of changes, the voilàs and pardons. the day after his
return they went down to be shorn and washed in the perfumed
breeze of the fans.
in front of the carleton hotel, its windows as stubbornly
blank to the summer as so many cellar doors, a car passed
them and tommy barban was in it. nicole’s momentary
glimpse of his expression, taciturn and thoughtful and, in
the second of seeing her, wide-eyed and alert, disturbed her.
she wanted to be going where he was going. the hour with
the hair-dresser seemed one of the wasteful intervals that
composed her life, another little prison. the coiffeuse in her
white uniform, faintly sweating lip-rouge and cologne reminded
her of many nurses.
in the next room dick dozed under an apron and a lather
of soap. the mirror in front of nicole reflected the passage
between the men’s side and the women’s, and nicole started
up at the sight of tommy entering and wheeling sharply
into the men’s shop. she knew with a flush of joy that there
was going to be some sort of showdown.
she heard fragments of its beginning.
‘hello, i want to see you.’
448 tender is the night
‘... serious.’
‘... serious.’
‘... perfectly agreeable.’
in a minute dick came into nicole’s booth, his expression
emerging annoyed from behind the towel of his hastily
rinsed face.
‘your friend has worked himself up into a state. he wants
to see us together, so i agreed to have it over with. come
along!’
‘but my hair—it’s half cut.’
‘nevermind—come along!’
resentfully she had the staring coiffeuse remove the towels.
feeling messy and unadorned she followed dick from
the hotel. outside tommy bent over her hand.
‘we’ll go to the café des alliées,’ said dick.
‘wherever we can be alone,’ tommy agreed.
under the arching trees, central in summer, dick asked:
‘will you take anything, nicole?’
‘a citron pressé.’
‘for me a demi,’ said tommy.
‘the blackenwite with siphon,’ said dick.
‘il n’y a plus de blackenwite. nous n’avons que le johnny
walkair.’
‘ca va.’
“she’s—not—wired for sound
but on the quiet
you ought to try it—‘

‘your wife does not love you,’ said tommy suddenly. ‘she
loves me.’
the two men regarded each other with a curious impotence
of expression. there can be little communication
between men in that position, for their relation is indirect,
and consists of how much each of them has possessed or will
possess of the woman in question, so that their emotions
pass through her divided self as through a bad telephone
connection.
‘wait a minute,’ dick said. ‘donnez moi du gin et du siphon.’
‘bien, monsieur.’
‘all right, go on, tommy.’
‘it’s very plain to me that your marriage to nicole has
run its course. she is through. i’ve waited five years for that
to be so.’
‘what does nicole say?’
they both looked at her.
‘i’ve gotten very fond of tommy, dick.’
he nodded.
‘you don’t care for me any more,’ she continued. ‘it’s all
just habit. things were never the same after rosemary.’
unattracted to this angle, tommy broke in sharply
with:
‘you don’t understand nicole. you treat her always like a
patient because she was once sick.’
they were suddenly interrupted by an insistent american,
of sinister aspect, vending copies of the herald and of
the times fresh from new york.
450 tender is the night
‘got everything here, buddies,’ he announced. ‘been
here long?’
‘cessez cela! allez ouste!’ tommy cried and then to
dick, ‘now no woman would stand such—‘
‘buddies,’ interrupted the american again. ‘you think
i’m wasting my time—but lots of others don’t.’ he brought
a gray clipping from his purse—and dick recognized it as
he saw it. it cartooned millions of americans pouring from
liners with bags of gold. ‘you think i’m not going to get part
of that? well, i am. i’m just over from nice for the tour de
france.’
as tommy got him off with a fierce ‘allez-vous-en,’ dick
identified him as the man who had once hailed him in the
rue de saints anges, five years before.
‘when does the tour de france get here?’ he called after
him.
‘any minute now, buddy.’
he departed at last with a cheery wave and tommy returned
to dick.
‘elle doit avoir plus avec moi qu’avec vous.’
‘speak english! what do you mean ‘doit avoir’?’
‘‘doit avoir?’ would have more happiness with me.’
‘you’d be new to each other. but nicole and i have had
much happiness together, tommy.’
‘l’amour de famille,’ tommy said, scoffing.
‘if you and nicole married won’t that be ‘l’amour de famille’?’
the increasing commotion made him break off;
presently it came to a serpentine head on the promenade
and a group, presently a crowd, of people sprung from hid-

den siestas, lined the curbstone.
boys sprinted past on bicycles, automobiles jammed
with elaborate betasselled sportsmen slid up the street, high
horns tooted to announce the approach of the race, and
unsuspected cooks in undershirts appeared at restaurant
doors as around a bend a procession came into sight. first
was a lone cyclist in a red jersey, toiling intent and confident
out of the westering sun, passing to the melody of a high
chattering cheer. then three together in a harlequinade of
faded color, legs caked yellow with dust and sweat, faces expressionless,
eyes heavy and endlessly tired.
tommy faced dick, saying: ‘i think nicole wants a divorce—i
suppose you’ll make no obstacles?’
a troupe of fifty more swarmed after the first bicycle racers,
strung out over two hundred yards; a few were smiling
and selfconscious, a few obviously exhausted, most of them
indifferent and weary. a retinue of small boys passed, a few
defiant stragglers, a light truck carried the dupes of accident
and defeat. they were back at the table. nicole wanted dick
to take the initiative, but he seemed content to sit with his
face half-shaved matching her hair half-washed.
‘isn’t it true you’re not happy with me any more?’ nicole
continued. ‘without me you could get to your work again—
you could work better if you didn’t worry about me.’
tommy moved impatiently.
‘that is so useless. nicole and i love each other, that’s all
there is to it.’
‘well, then,’ said the doctor, ‘since it’s all settled, suppose
we go back to the barber shop.’
452 tender is the night
tommy wanted a row: ‘there are several points—‘
‘nicole and i will talk things over,’ said dick equitably.
‘don’t worry—i agree in principal, and nicole and i understand
each other. there’s less chance of unpleasantness if we
avoid a threecornered discussion.’
unwillingly acknowledging dick’s logic, tommy was
moved by an irresistible racial tendency to chisel for an advantage.
‘let it be understood that from this moment,’ he said, ‘i
stand in the position of nicole’s protector until details can
be arranged. and i shall hold you strictly accountable for
any abuse of the fact that you continue to inhabit the same
house.’
‘i never did go in for making love to dry loins,’ said
dick.
he nodded, and walked off toward the hotel with nicole’s
whitest eyes following him.
‘he was fair enough,’ tommy conceded. ‘darling, will we
be together to-night?’
‘i suppose so.’
so it had happened—and with a minimum of drama; nicole
felt outguessed, realizing that from the episode of the
camphor-rub, dick had anticipated everything. but also she
felt happy and excited, and the odd little wish that she could
tell dick all about it faded quickly. but her eyes followed his
figure until it became a dot and mingled with the other dots
in the summer crowd.

the day before doctor diver left the riviera he spent all
his time with his children. he was not young any more with
a lot of nice thoughts and dreams to have about himself, so
he wanted to remember them well. the children had been
told that this winter they would be with their aunt in london
and that soon they were going to come and see him
in america. fräulein was not to be discharged without his
consent.
he was glad he had given so much to the little girl—about
the boy he was more uncertain—always he had been uneasy
about what he had to give to the ever-climbing, ever-clinging,
breast-searching young. but, when he said good-by to
them, he wanted to lift their beautiful heads off their necks
and hold them close for hours.
he embraced the old gardener who had made the first
garden at villa diana six years ago; he kissed the provençal
girl who helped with the children. she had been with them
for almost a decade and she fell on her knees and cried until
dick jerked her to her feet and gave her three hundred
francs. nicole was sleeping late, as had been agreed upon—
he left a note for her, and one for baby warren who was just
back from sardinia and staying at the house. dick took a big
drink from a bottle of brandy three feet high, holding ten
quarts, that some one had presented them with.
454 tender is the night
then he decided to leave his bags by the station in cannes
and take a last look at gausse’s beach.
the beach was peopled with only an advance guard of
children when nicole and her sister arrived that morning.
a white sun, chivied of outline by a white sky, boomed over
a windless day. waiters were putting extra ice into the bar;
an american photographer from the a. and p. worked with
his equipment in a precarious shade and looked up quickly
at every footfall descending the stone steps. at the hotel his
prospective subjects slept late in darkened rooms upon their
recent opiate of dawn.
when nicole started out on the beach she saw dick, not
dressed for swimming, sitting on a rock above. she shrank
back in the shadow of her dressing-tent. in a minute baby
joined her, saying:
‘dick’s still there.’
‘i saw him.’
‘i think he might have the delicacy to go.’
‘this is his place—in a way, he discovered it. old gausse
always says he owes everything to dick.’
baby looked calmly at her sister.
‘we should have let him confine himself to his bicycle
excursions,’ she remarked. ‘when people are taken out of
their depths they lose their heads, no matter how charming
a bluff they put up.’
‘dick was a good husband to me for six years,’ nicole
said. ‘all that time i never suffered a minute’s pain because
of him, and he always did his best never to let anything hurt
me.’

baby’s lower jaw projected slightly as she said:
‘that’s what he was educated for.’
the sisters sat in silence; nicole wondering in a tired way
about things; baby considering whether or not to marry the
latest candidate for her hand and money, an authenticated
hapsburg. she was not quite thinking about it. her affairs
had long shared such a sameness, that, as she dried out,
they were more important for their conversational value
than for themselves. her emotions had their truest existence
in the telling of them.
‘is he gone?’ nicole asked after a while. ‘i think his train
leaves at noon.’
baby looked.
‘no. he’s moved up higher on the terrace and he’s talking
to some women. anyhow there are so many people now
that he doesn’t have to see us.’
he had seen them though, as they left their pavilion, and
he followed them with his eyes until they disappeared again.
he sat with mary minghetti, drinking anisette.
‘you were like you used to be the night you helped us,’
she was saying, ‘except at the end, when you were horrid
about caroline. why aren’t you nice like that always? you
can be.’
it seemed fantastic to dick to be in a position where
mary north could tell him about things.
‘your friends still like you, dick. but you say awful things
to people when you’ve been drinking. i’ve spent most of my
time defending you this summer.’
‘that remark is one of doctor eliot’s classics.’
456 tender is the night
‘it’s true. nobody cares whether you drink or not—‘ she
hesitated, ‘even when abe drank hardest, he never offended
people like you do.’
‘you’re all so dull,’ he said.
‘but we’re all there is!’ cried mary. ‘if you don’t like nice
people, try the ones who aren’t nice, and see how you like
that! all people want is to have a good time and if you make
them unhappy you cut yourself off from nourishment.’
‘have i been nourished?’ he asked.
mary was having a good time, though she did not know
it, as she had sat down with him only out of fear. again she
refused a drink and said: ‘self-indulgence is back of it. of
course, after abe you can imagine how i feel about it—since
i watched the progress of a good man toward alcoholism—‘
down the steps tripped lady caroline sibly-biers with
blithe theatricality.
dick felt fine—he was already well in advance of the
day; arrived at where a man should be at the end of a good
dinner, yet he showed only a fine, considered, restrained interest
in mary. his eyes, for the moment clear as a child’s,
asked her sympathy and stealing over him he felt the old
necessity of convincing her that he was the last man in the
world and she was the last woman.
... then he would not have to look at those two other figures,
a man and a woman, black and white and metallic
against the sky... .
‘you once liked me, didn’t you?’ he asked.
‘liked you—i loved you. everybody loved you. you
could’ve had anybody you wanted for the asking—‘
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 457
‘there has always been something between you and me.’
she bit eagerly. ‘has there, dick?’
‘always—i knew your troubles and how brave you were
about them.’ but the old interior laughter had begun inside
him and he knew he couldn’t keep it up much longer.
‘i always thought you knew a lot,’ mary said enthusiastically.
‘more about me than any one has ever known. perhaps
that’s why i was so afraid of you when we didn’t get along
so well.’
his glance fell soft and kind upon hers, suggesting an
emotion underneath; their glances married suddenly, bedded,
strained together. then, as the laughter inside of him
became so loud that it seemed as if mary must hear it, dick
switched off the light and they were back in the riviera
sun.
‘i must go,’ he said. as he stood up he swayed a little; he
did not feel well any more—his blood raced slow. he raised
his right hand and with a papal cross he blessed the beach
from the high terrace. faces turned upward from several
umbrellas.
‘i’m going to him.’ nicole got to her knees.
‘no, you’re not,’ said tommy, pulling her down firmly.
‘let well enough alone.’
458 tender is the night

nicole kept in touch with dick after her new marriage;
there were letters on business matters, and about the children.
when she said, as she often did, ‘i loved dick and i’ll
never forget him,’ tommy answered, ‘of course not—why
should you?’
dick opened an office in buffalo, but evidently without
success. nicole did not find what the trouble was, but she
heard a few months later that he was in a little town named
batavia, n.y., practising general medicine, and later that
he was in lockport, doing the same thing. by accident she
heard more about his life there than anywhere: that he bicycled
a lot, was much admired by the ladies, and always had a
big stack of papers on his desk that were known to be an important
treatise on some medical subject, almost in process
of completion. he was considered to have fine manners and
once made a good speech at a public health meeting on the
subject of drugs; but he became entangled with a girl who
worked in a grocery store, and he was also involved in a lawsuit
about some medical question; so he left lockport.
after that he didn’t ask for the children to be sent to
america and didn’t answer when nicole wrote asking him
if he needed money. in the last letter she had from him he
told her that he was practising in geneva, new york, and
she got the impression that he had settled down with some 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 459
one to keep house for him. she looked up geneva in an atlas
and found it was in the heart of the finger lakes section
and considered a pleasant place. perhaps, so she liked to
think, his career was biding its time, again like grant’s in
galena; his latest note was post-marked from hornell, new
york, which is some distance from geneva and a very small
town; in any case he is almost certainly in that section of the
country, in one town or another.
