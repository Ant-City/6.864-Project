dr.[CHARACTER] - 
                	torvald's
best friend. dr.[CHARACTER] stands out as the one character in the play
who is by and large unconcerned with what others think of him. he
is also notable for his stoic acceptance of his fate. unlike torvald
and nora, dr.[CHARACTER] admits to the diseased nature (literally, in
his case) of his life. for the most part, he avoids talking to torvald
about his imminent death out of respect for torvald's distaste for
ugliness.
