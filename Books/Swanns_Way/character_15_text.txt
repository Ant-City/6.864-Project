voice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his heart's content the
part of 'double-dealer,' a part to which he was not, otherwise, adapted,
without in the least degree compromising his unassailable and quite
unmerited reputation of being a kind-hearted old curmudgeon, could make
the cur√© and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying in a harsh
voice: "what d'ye say to this, now? it seems that she plays music with
her friend, mlle. vinteuil. that surprises you, does it? oh, i know
nothing, nothing at all. it was papa vinteuil who told me all about
it yesterday. after all, she has every right to be fond of music, that
girl. i should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a
child; nor vinteuil either, it seems. and then he plays music too,
with his daughter's friend. why, gracious heavens, it must be a regular
musical box, that house out there! what are you laughing at? i say
they've been playing too much music, those peo

had told me that i might stay out as late as i pleased; and having
gone as far as the montjouvain pond, where i enjoyed seeing again the
reflection of the tiled roof of the hut, i had lain down in the shade
and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up
behind the house, just where i had waited for my parents, years before,
one day when they had gone to call on m. vinteuil. it was almost dark
when i awoke, and i wished to rise and go away, but i saw mlle. vinteuil
(or thought, at least, that i recognised her, for i had not seen her
often at combray, and then only when she was still a child, whereas
she was now growing into a young woman), who probably had just come in,
standing in front of me, and only a few feet away from me, in that room
in which her father had entertained mine, and which she had now made
into a little sitting-room for herself. the window was partly open; the
lamp was lighted; i could watch her every movement without her being
able to

bbled on loose sheets of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain
unknown for ever; my mother thought, also, of that other and still more
cruel renunciation to which m. vinteuil had been driven, that of seeing
the girl happily settled, with an honest and respectable future; when
she called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come
upon my aunts' old music-master, she was moved to very real grief, and
shuddered to think of that other grief, so different in its bitterness,
which mlle. vinteuil must now be feeling, tinged with remorse at having
virtually killed her father. "poor m. vinteuil," my mother would say,
"he lived for his daughter, and now he has died for her, without getting
his reward. will he get it now, i wonder, and in what form? it can only
come to him from her."

at the far end of mlle. vinteuil's sitting-room, on the mantelpiece,
stood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch,
just as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside

then flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little
table on which she placed the photograph, just as, long ago, m. vinteuil
had 'placed' beside him the piece of music which he would have liked
to play over to my parents. and then her friend came in. mlle. vinteuil
greeted her without rising, clasping her hands behind her head, and
drew her body to one side of the sofa, as though to 'make room.' but no
sooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps
suggesting a particular position to her friend, with an emphasis which
might well be regarded as importunate. she thought that her friend would
prefer, no doubt, to sit down at some distance from her, upon a chair;
she felt that she had been indiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright;

as a desire to sleep,
and that alone, which had made her lie down there. despite the rude
and hectoring familiarity with which she treated her companion i could
recognise in her the obsequious and reticent advances, the abrupt
scruples and restraints which had characterised her father. presently
she rose and came to the window, where she pretended to be trying to
close the shutters and not succeeding.

"leave them open," said her friend. "i am hot."

"but it's too dreadful! people will see us," mlle. vinteuil answered.
and then she guessed, probably, that her friend would think that she had
uttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other
words, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from
prudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. and so, although
i could not see her face clearly enough, i am sure that the expression
must have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so
delightful, when she hastily went on: "when i say 'see us' i mean, of

 other element, the old campaigner, battered but
triumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire.

"oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at
this time of night in this densely populated district!" said her friend,
with bitter irony. "and what if they are?" she went on, feeling bound
to annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which
she was repeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand
which, she knew, it would please mlle. vinteuil to hear. "and what if
they are? all the better that they should see us."

mlle. vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. in her sensitive
and scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow,
spontaneously, from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her
eager senses clamoured. she reached out as far as she could across the
limitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to
a vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought, but the
words which, she imag

herself to say was said in a strained tone, in which her ingrained
timidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech; while
she kept on interrupting herself with: "you're sure you aren't cold? you
aren't too hot? you don't want to sit and read by yourself?...

"your ladyship's thoughts seem to be rather 'warm' this evening," she
concluded, doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used, on
some earlier occasion, by her friend.

in the v-shaped opening of her crape bodice mlle. vinteuil felt the
sting of her friend's sudden kiss; she gave a little scream and
ran away; and then they began to chase one another about the room,
scrambling over the furniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like
wings, clucking and crowing like a pair of amorous fowls. at last mlle.
vinteuil fell down exhausted upon the sofa, where she was screened from
me by the stooping body of her friend. but the latter now had her back
turned to the little table on which the old music-master's portrait had

rranged. mlle. vinteuil realised that her friend would not see
it unless her attention were drawn to it, and so exclaimed, as if she
herself had just noticed it for the first time: "oh! there's my father's
picture looking at us; i can't think who can have put it there; i'm sure
i've told them twenty times, that is not the proper place for it."

daily profanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently
a liturgical response: "let him stay there. he can't trouble us any
longer. d'you think he'd start whining, d'you think he'd pack you out
of the house if he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old
monkey?"

to which mlle. vinteuil replied, "oh, please!"--a gentle reproach
which testified to the genuine goodness of her nature, not that it
was prompted by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this
fashion (for that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself,
by a long course of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such
moments), but rather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all
appearance of egotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which

eless dead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held
out a chaste brow to be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done
to her mother, feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between
them, inflict the last turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing m.
vinteuil, as though they were actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred
rights of fatherhood. her friend took the girl's head in her hands and
placed a kiss on her brow with a docility prompted by the real affection
she had for mlle. vinteuil, as well as by the desire to bring what
distraction she could into the dull and melancholy life of an orphan.

"do you know what i should like to do to that old horror?" she said,
taking up the photograph. she murmured in mlle. vinteuil's ear something
that i could not distinguish.

"oh! you would never dare."

"not dare to spit on it? on that?" shouted the friend with deliberate
brutality.

hutters close; but i knew now what was the reward that m. vinteuil,
in return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on
account of his daughter, had received from her after his death.

and yet i have since reflected that if m. vinteuil had been able to be
present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have
continued to believe in his daughter's soundness of heart, and that he
might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. it was true
that in all mlle. vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so
strong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it
exhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a
'sadist'; it is behind the footlights of a paris theatre, and not under
the homely lamp of an actual country house, that one expects to see a
girl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has
lived and died for nothing and no one but herself; and when we find in
real life a desire for melodramatic effect,

 it is generally the 'sadic'
instinct that is responsible for it. it is possible that, without being
in the least inclined towards 'sadism,' a girl might have shewn the
same outrageous cruelty as mlle. vinteuil in desecrating the memory and
defying the wishes of her dead father, but she would not have given them
deliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking
in subtlety; the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less
evident to other people, and even to herself, since she would not have
admitted to herself that she was doing wrong. but, appearances apart, in
mlle. vinteuil's soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element
was probably not unmixed. a 'sadist' o

f her kind is an artist in evil,
which a wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil
would not have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her,
and would not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for
virtue, respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never
have practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious
delight in their profanation. 'sadists' of mlle. vinteuil's sort are
creatures so purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even
sensual pleasure appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved
for the wicked. and when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it
they endeavour to impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of
wicked people, for themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain
the momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own
gentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleas

the poor old music-master. indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she
really desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures,
but what remained between them and her and prevented her from any
direct enjoyment of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his
mother's blue eyes which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to
be kept in the family, those little friendly movements and inclinations
which set up between the viciousness of mlle. vinteuil and herself a
phraseology, a mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it
as not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and
courtesies to which she must devote herself every day. it was not evil
that gave her the idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it
was pleasure, rather, that seemed evil. and as, every time that she
indulged in it, pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as,
ordinarily, had no place in her virtuous mind, she came at

perhaps mlle. vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether
bad, not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous
utterances. at any rate, she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses
on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all feigned, perhaps, but akin
in their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have
been discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness
and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and cruelty. she was
able to delude herself for a mom
