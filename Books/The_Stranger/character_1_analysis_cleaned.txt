[CHARACTER] 
like meursault, marie delights in physical contact. she
kisses meursault frequently in public and enjoys the act of sex.
however, unlike meursault's physical affection for marie, marie's
physical affection for meursault signals a deeper sentimental and
emotional attachment. though marie is disappointed when meursault expresses
his indifference toward love and marriage, she does not end the
relationship or rethink her desire to marry him. in fact, meursault's
strange behavior seems part of his appeal for her. she says that
she probably loves him because he is so peculiar. there also may
be an element of pragmatism in marie's decision to marry meursault.
she enjoys a good deal of freedom within the relationship because
he does not take any interest in her life when they are not together. 
whatever her motivations for entering into the relationship, marie
remains loyal to meursault when he is arrested and put on trial.
in the context of camus's absurdist philosophy, marie's loyalty
represents a mixed blessing, because her feelings of faith and hope
prevent her from reaching the understanding that meursault attains
at the end of the novel. marie never grasps the indifference of the
universe, and she never comes to understand the redemptive value
of abandoning hope. camus implies that marie, lacking the deeper
understanding of the universe that meursault has attained, is less
"enlightened" than meursault.
