tremendous sight, full of power and beauty.

everyone was now about, talking excitedly and praying that the
locusts should camp in umuofia for the night. for although locusts
had not visited umuofia for many years, everybody knew by
instinct that they were very good to eat. and at last the locusts did
descend. they settled on every tree and on every blade of grass,
they settled on the roofs and covered the bare ground. mighty tree
branches broke away under them, and the whole country became
the brown-earth color of the vast, hungry swarm.

many people went out with baskets trying to catch them, but the
elders counseled patience till nightfall. and they were right. the
locusts settled in the bushes for the night and their wings became



wet with dew. then all umuofia turned out in spite of the cold
harmattan, and everyone filled his bags and pots with locusts. the
next morning they were roasted in clay pots and then spread in the
sun until they became dry and brittle. and for many days thi

was a drinking horn in it, and also a drinking gourd, and they
knocked against each other as he searched. when he brought out
the snuff-bottle he tapped it a few times against his knee-cap
before taking out some snuff on the palm of his left hand. then he
remembered that he had not taken out his snuff-spoon. he searched
his bag again and brought out a small, flat, ivory spoon, with
which he carried the brown snuff to his nostrils.

ezinma took the dish in one hand and the empty water bowl in the
other and went back to her mother's hut. "she should have been a





boy," okonkwo said to himself again. his mind went back to
ikemefuna and he shivered. if only he could find some work to do
he would be able to forget. but it was the season of rest between
the harvest and the next planting season. the only work that men
did at this time was covering the walls of their compound with new
palm fronds. and

men he built himself an obi and three huts for his
wives. he then installed his personal god and the symbols of his
departed fathers. each of uchendu's five sons contributed three
hundred seed-yams to enable their cousin to plant a farm, for as
soon as the first rain came farming would begin.

at last the rain came. it was sudden and tremendous. for two or
three moons the sun had been gathering strength till it seemed to
breathe a breath of fire on the earth. all the grass had long been
scorched brown, and the sands felt like live coals to the feet.
evergreen trees wore a dusty coat of brown. the birds were
silenced in the forests, and the world lay panting under the live,



vibrating heat. and then came the clap of thunder. it was an angry,
metallic and thirsty clap, unlike the deep and liquid rumbling of the
rainy season. a mighty wind arose and filled the air with dust.
palm trees swayed as the wind combed their leaves into flying
crests like strange and fantastic coiffure.

everybody in the assembly spoke, and in the end it was decided to
ostracize the christians. okonkwo ground his teeth in disgust.



that night a bell-man went through the length and breadth of
mbanta proclaiming that the adherents of the new faith were
thenceforth excluded from the life and privileges of the clan.



the christians had grown in number and were now a small
community of men, women and children, self-assured and
confident. mr. brown, the white missionary, paid regular visits to
them. "when i think that it is only eighteen months since the seed
was first sown among you," he said, "i marvel at what the lord
hath wrought."

it was wednesday in holy week and mr. kiaga had asked the
women to bring red earth and white chalk and water to scrub the
church for easter, and the women had formed themselves into
three groups for this purpose. they set out early that morning,
some of them with their water-pots to the stream, another gro

n and women in umuofia who did not feel as
strongly as okonkwo about the new dispensation. the white man
had indeed brought a lunatic religion, but he had also built a
trading store and for the first time palm-oil and kernel became
things of great price, and much money flowed into umuofia.

and even in the matter of religion there was a growing feeling that
there might be something in it after all, something vaguely akin to
method in the overwhelming madness.

this growing feeling was due to mr. brown, the white missionary,
who was very firm in restraining his flock from provoking the
wrath of the clan. one member in particular was very difficult to
restrain. his name was enoch and his father was the priest of the



snake cult. the story went around that enoch had killed and eaten
the sacred python, and that his father had cursed him.



mr. brown preached against such excess of zeal. everything was
possible, he told his energetic flock, but everything was not
expedient. and so mr. brown c

ame to be respected even by the
clan, because he trod softly on its faith. he made friends with some
of the great men of the clan and on one of his frequent visits to the
neighboring villages he had been presented with a carved elephant
tusk, which was a sign of dignity and rank. one of the great men in
that village was called akunna and he had given one of his sons to
be taught the white man's knowledge in mr. brown's school.

whenever mr. brown went to that village he spent long hours with
akunna in his obi talking through an interpreter about religion.
neither of them succeeded in converting the other but they learned
more about their different beliefs.

"you say that there is one supreme god who made heaven and
earth," said akunna on one of mr. brown's visits. "we also believe
in him and call him chukwu. he made all the world and the other
gods."

"there are no other gods," said mr. brown. "chukwu is the only
god and all others are 
 
 ___________________________
 
false. you carve a piece of wood—like that
one" (he pointed at the rafters from which akunna's carved ikenga
hung), "and you call it a god. but it is still a piece of wood."

"yes," said akunna. "it is indeed a piece of wood. the tree from
which it came was made by chukwu, as indeed all minor gods
were. but he made them for his messengers so that we could
approach him through them. it is like yourself. you are the head of
your church."

"no," protested mr. brown. "the head of my church is god
himself."



"i know," said akunna, "but there must be a head in this world
among men. somebody like yourself must be the head here."



"the head of my church in that sense is in england."

"that is exactly what i am saying. the head of your church is in
your country. he has sent you here as his messenger. and you
have also appointed your own messengers and servants. or let me
take another example, the district commissioner. he is sent by
your king."

"they have

 a queen," said the interpreter on his own account.

"your queen sends her messenger, the district commissioner. he
finds that he cannot do the work alone and so he appoints kotma to
help him. it is the same with god, or chukwu. he appoints the
smaller gods to help him because his work is too great for one
person."

"you should not think of him as a person," said mr. brown. "it is
because you do so that you imagine he must need helpers. and the
worst thing about it is that you give all the worship to the false
gods you have created."

"that is not so. we make sacrifices to the little gods, but when
they fail and there is no one else to turn to we go to chukwu. it is
right to do so. we approach a great man through his servants. but
when his servants fail to help us, then we go to the last source of
hope. we appear to pay greater attention to the little gods but th

is not so. we worry them more because we are afraid to worry
their master. our fathers knew that chukwu was the overlord and
that is why many of them gave their children the name
chukwuka—"chukwu is supreme."



"you said one interesting thing," said mr. brown. "you are afraid
of chukwu. in my religion chukwu is a loving father and need not
be feared by those who do his will."



"but we must fear him when we are not doing his will," said
akunna. "and who is to tell his will? it is too great to be known."

in this way mr. brown learned a good deal about the religion of
the clan and he came to the conclusion that a frontal attack on it
would not succeed. and so he built a school and a little hospital in
umuofia. he went from family to family begging p

their children to his school. but at first they only sent their slaves
or sometimes their lazy children. mr. brown begged and argued
and prophesied. he said that the leaders of the land in the future
would be men and women who had learned to read and write. if
umuofia failed to send her children to the school, strangers would
come from other places to rule them. they could already see that
happening in the native court, where the d.c. was surrounded by
strangers who spoke his tongue. most of these strangers came from
the distant town of umuru on the bank of the great river where
the white man first went.

n the end mr. brown's arguments began to have an effect. more
people came to learn in his school, and he encouraged them with
gifts of singlets and towels. they were not all young, these people
who came to learn. some of them were thirty years old or more.
they worked on their farms in the morning and went to school in
the afternoon. and it was not long before the people began to say
that the white man's medicine was quick in working. mr. brown's
school produced quick results. a few months in it were enough to
make one a court messenger or even a court clerk. those who
stayed longer became teachers,- and from umuofia laborers went
forth into the lord's vineyard. new churches were established in
the surrounding villages and a few schools with them. from the
very beginning religion and education went hand in hand. mr.

but mr. brown himself was breaking down in health. at first he
ignored the warning signs. but in the end he had to leave his flock,
sad and broken.



it was in the first rainy season after okonkwo's return to umuofia
that mr. brown left for home. as soon as he had learned of
okonkwo's return five months earlier, the missionary had
immediately paid him a visit. he had just sent okonkwo's son,
nwoye, who was now called isaac, to the new training college for
teachers in umuru. and he had hoped that okonkwo would be
happy to hear of it. but okonkwo had driven him away with the
threat that if he came into his compound again, he would be carried
out of it.

okonkwo's return to his native land was not as memorable as he

initiated his two sons into the ozo society as he had planned he
would have caused a stir. but the initiation rite was performed
once in three years in umuofia, and he had to wait for nearly two
years for the next round of ceremonies.



okonkwo was deeply grieved. and it was not just a personal grief.
he mourned for the clan, which he saw breaking up and falling
apart, and he mourned for the warlike men of umuofia, who had so
unaccountably become soft like women.



chapter twenty-two

mr. brown's successor was the reverend james smith, and he was
a different kind of man. he condemned openly mr. brown's policy
of compromise and accommodation. he saw things as black and
white. and black was evil. he saw the world as a battlefield in
which the children of light were locked in mortal conflict with the
sons of darkness. he spoke in his sermons about sheep and goats
and about wheat and tares. he believed in slaying the prophets of
baal.

mr. smith was greatly distressed by the ignorance whi

his flock showed even in such things as the trinity and the
sacraments. it only showed that they were seeds sown on a rocky
soil. mr. brown had thought of nothing but numbers. he should
have known that the kingdom of god did not depend on large
crowds. our lord himself stressed the importance of fewness.
narrow is the way and few the number. to fill the lord's holy
temple with an idolatrous crowd clamoring for signs was a folly of
everlasting consequence. our lord used the whip only once in his
life—to drive the crowd away from his church.

within a few weeks of his arrival in umuofia mr. smith suspended
a young woman from the ch

 even some of the most faithful
confirmed, the story of really evil children who were not deterred
by mutilation, but came back with all the scars. he replied that
such stories were spread in the world by the devil to lead men
astray. those who believed such stories were unworthy of the
lord's table.



there was a saying in umuofia that as a man danced so the drums
were beaten for him. mr. smith danced a furious step and so the
drums went mad. the over-zealous converts who had smarted
under mr. brown's restraining hand now flourished in full favor.
one of them was enoch, the son of the snake-priest who was
believed to have killed and eaten the sacred python. enoch's
devotion to the new faith had seemed so much greater than mr.
brown's that the villagers called him the outsider who wept louder
than the bereaved.

enoch was short and slight of build, and always seemed in great
haste. his feet were short and broad, and when he stood or walked
his heels came together and his feet opened outward

ed and meant to go in different directions. such was the
excessive energy bottled up in

enoch's small body that it was always erupting in quarrels and
fights. on sundays he always imagined that the sermon was
preached for the benefit of his enemies. and if he happened to sit
near one of them he would occasionally turn to give him a
meaningful look, as if to say, "i told you so." it was enoch who
touched off the great conflict between church and clan in umuofia
which had been gathering since mr. brown left.

it happened during the annual ceremony which was held in honor
of the earth deity. at such times the ancestors of the clan who had



been committed to mother earth at their death emerged again as
egwugwu through tiny ant-holes.



one of the greatest crimes a man could commit was to unmask an
egwugwu in public, or to say or do anything which might reduce its
immortal prestige in the eyes of the uninitiated. and this was what
enoch did.

the annual worship of the earth goddess fell on a
