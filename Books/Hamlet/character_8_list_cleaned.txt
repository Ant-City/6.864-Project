the [CHARACTER] - 
                	the
specter of hamlet's recently deceased father. the [CHARACTER], who claims
to have been murdered by claudius, calls upon hamlet to avenge him.
however, it is not entirely certain whether the [CHARACTER] is what it
appears to be, or whether it is something else. hamlet speculates that
the [CHARACTER] might be a devil sent to deceive him and tempt him into
murder, and the question of what the [CHARACTER] is or where it comes
from is never definitively resolved.
