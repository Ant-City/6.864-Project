Cleon - 
      
        Governor of Tarsus, a city beset by famine. Tarsus is Pericles's first stop, where Cleon assumes that Pericles's ships contain soldiers intent on conquering Tarsus when none can defend it. Pericles instead gives corn to the nation, and the citizens are grateful. Cleon later pledges to take care of Pericles's infant child, but his wife, Dionyza, plots to kill the child. Cleon was apparently unaware of the scheme, but when he hears of it, wishes it could be undone. But soon Cleon takes the blame for what Dionyza has done, and both are punished.
