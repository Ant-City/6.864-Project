 final journey past our house.
“there goes the meanest man ever god blew breath into,” murmured calpurnia,
and she spat meditatively into the yard. we looked at her in surprise, for
calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people.
the neighborhood thought when mr. radley went under boo would come out,
but it had another think coming: boo’s elder brother returned from pensacola and
took mr. radley’s place. the only difference between him and his father was
their ages. jem said mr. nathan radley “bought cotton,” too. mr. nathan would
speak to us, however, when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him
coming from town with a magazine in his hand.
the more we told dill about the radleys, the more he wanted to know, the longer
he would stand hugging the light-pole on the corner, the more he would wonder.
“wonder what he does in there,” he would murmur. “looks like he’d just stick
his head out the door.”

jem said, “he goes out, all right, when it’s pitch dark. mis

ould reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff,
assorted townsfolk, and miss stephanie crawford, who had more to say about the
radleys than anybody in maycomb.
when it was time to play boo’s big scene, jem would sneak into the house, steal
the scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when calpurnia’s back was turned,
then sit in the swing and cut up newspapers. dill would walk by, cough at jem,
and jem would fake a plunge into dill’s thigh. from where i stood it looked real.
when mr. nathan radley passed us on his daily trip to town, we would stand still
and silent until he was out of sight, then wonder what he would do to us if he
suspected. our activities halted when any of the neighbors appeared, and once i

saw miss maudie atkinson staring across the street at us, her hedge clippers
poised in midair.
one day we were so busily playing chapter xxv, book ii of one man’s family,
we did not see atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us, slapping a rolled
magazine against his knee.

: “we
gotta get home, they’ll miss us.”
we ran across the schoolyard, crawled under the fence to deer’s pasture behind
our house, climbed our back fence and were at the back steps before jem would
let us pause to rest.
respiration normal, the three of us strolled as casually as we could to the front
yard. we looked down the street and saw a circle of neighbors at the radley front
gate.
“we better go down there,” said jem. “they’ll think it’s funny if we don’t show
up.”
mr. nathan radley was standing inside his gate, a shotgun broken across his arm.
atticus was standing beside miss maudie and miss stephanie crawford. miss
rachel and mr. avery were near by. none of them saw us come up.
we eased in beside miss maudie, who looked around. “where were you all,
didn’t you hear the commotion?”
“what happened?” asked jem.
“mr. radley shot at a negro in his collard patch.”
“oh. did he hit him?”
“no,” said miss stephanie. “shot in the air. scared him pale, though.

distance.
as usual, we met atticus coming home from work that evening. when we were at
our steps jem said, “atticus, look down yonder at that tree, please sir.”
“what tree, son?”
“the one on the corner of the radley lot comin‘ from school.”
“yes?”
“is that tree dyin‘?”
“why no, son, i don’t think so. look at the leaves, they’re all green and full, no
brown patches anywhere—”
“it ain’t even sick?”
“that tree’s as healthy as you are, jem. why?”
“mr. nathan radley said it was dyin‘.”
“well maybe it is. i’m sure mr. radley knows more about his trees than we do.”
atticus left us on the porch. jem leaned on a pillar, rubbing his shoulders against
it.

“do you itch, jem?” i asked as politely as i could. he did not answer. “come on
in, jem,” i said.
“after while.”
he stood there until nightfall, and i waited for him. when we went in the house i
saw he had been crying; his face was dirty in the right places, but i thought it odd
that i h

ce on the scene was not so much atticus’s doing as
hers. aunty had a way of declaring what is best for the family, and i suppose
her coming to live with us was in that category.
maycomb welcomed her. miss maudie atkinson baked a lane cake so loaded
with shinny it made me tight; miss stephanie crawford had long visits with aunt
alexandra, consisting mostly of miss stephanie shaking her head and saying,
“uh, uh, uh.” miss rachel next door had aunty over for coffee in the afternoons,
and mr. nathan radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was
glad to see her.
when she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, aunt alexandra
seemed as if she had always lived with us. her missionary society refreshments
added to her reputation as a hostess (she did not permit calpurnia to make the
delicacies required to sustain the society through long reports on rice christians);
she joined and became secretary of the maycomb amanuensis club. to all

eyond the grammar-school building; i
was now in the third grade, and our routines were so different i only walked to
school with jem in the mornings and saw him at mealtimes. he went out for
football, but was too slender and too young yet to do anything but carry the team
water buckets. this he did with enthusiasm; most afternoons he was seldom home
before dark.
the radley place had ceased to terrify me, but it was no less gloomy, no less
chilly under its great oaks, and no less uninviting. mr. nathan radley could still
be seen on a clear day, walking to and from town; we knew boo was there, for the

same old reason—nobody’d seen him carried out yet. i sometimes felt a twinge of
remorse, when passing by the old place, at ever having taken part in what must
have been sheer torment to arthur radley—what reasonable recluse wants
children peeping through his shutters, delivering greetings on the end of a fishing-
pole, wandering in his collards at night? and yet i remembered. two indian-head
