 dressing of the shops, that here too it was christmas
time again; but it was evening, and the streets were
lighted up.

the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked
scrooge if he knew it.

"know it!" said scrooge. "was i apprenticed here!"

they went in. at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh
wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two
inches taller he must have knocked his head against the
ceiling, scrooge cried in great excitement:

"why, it's old fezziwig! bless his heart; it's fezziwig
alive again!"

old fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the
clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. he rubbed his
hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over
himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and
called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:

"yo ho, there! ebenezer! dick!"

scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly
in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.

"dick wilkins, to

be sure!" said scrooge to the ghost.
"bless me, yes. there he is. he was very much attached
to me, was dick. poor dick! dear, dear!"

"yo ho, my boys!" said fezziwig. "no more work to-night.
christmas eve, dick. christmas, ebenezer! let's
have the shutters up," cried old fezziwig, with a sharp clap
of his hands, "before a man can say jack robinson!"

you wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it!
they charged into the street with the shutters--one, two,
three--had 'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred
'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back
before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.

"hilli-ho!" cried old fezziwig, skipping down from the
high desk, with wonderful agility. "clear away, my lads,
and let's have

 lots of room here! hilli-ho, dick! chirrup,
ebenezer!"

clear away! there was nothing they wouldn't have cleared
away, or couldn't have cleared away, with old fezziwig looking
on. it was done in a minute. every movable was packed off, as if
it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was
swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon
the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and
bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter's
night.

in came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the
lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty
stomach-aches. in came mrs. fezziwig

smile. in came the three miss fezziwigs, beaming and
lovable. in came the six young followers whose hearts they
broke. in came all the young men and women employed in
the business. in came the housemaid, with her cousin, the
baker. in came the cook, with her brother's particular friend,
the milkman. in came the boy from over the way, who was
suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying
to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who
was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.

e gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;
in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. away they all went,
twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again
the other way; down the middle and up again; round
and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old
top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top
couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top
couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! when
this result was brought about, old fezziwig, clapping his
hands to stop the dance, cried out, "well done!" and the
fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially
provided for that purpose. but scorning rest, upon his
reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no
dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home,
exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man
resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.

there were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more
dances, and there was c

was a great piece of cold roast, and there was a great piece
of cold boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.
but the great effect of the evening came after the roast
and boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! the sort
of man who knew his business better than you or i could
have told it him!) struck up "sir roger de coverley."  then
old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs. fezziwig. top

three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were
not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no
notion of walking.

fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would

d to issue
from fezziwig's calves. they shone in every part of the
dance like moons. you couldn't have predicted, at any given
time, what would have become of them next. and when old
fezziwig and mrs. fezziwig had gone all through the dance;
advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and
curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to
your place; fezziwig "cut"--cut so deftly, that he appeared
to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without
a stagger.

when the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.
mr. and mrs. fezziwig took their stations, one on either side
of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually
as he or she went out, wished him or her a merry christmas.
when everybody had retired but the two 'prentices, they did
the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,

 and underwent
the strangest agitation. it was not until now, when the
bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from
them, that he remembered the ghost, and became conscious
that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its
head burnt very clear.

"a small matter," said the ghost, "to make these silly
folks so full of gratitude."

"small!" echoed scrooge.

the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,
who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig:
and when he had done so, said,

"why! is it not? he has spent but a few pounds of
your mortal money: three or four perhaps. is that so
much that he deserves this praise?"

"it isn't that," said scrooge, heated by the remark, and
speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.
"it isn't that, spirit. he has the power to render us happy
or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a
pleasure or a toil. say that his power lies in words and
looks; in things so sli
