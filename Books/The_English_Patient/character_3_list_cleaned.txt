      a canadian thief whose profession is legitimized during the war when he puts his skills to use for the british intelligence effort. [CHARACTER], whom we first know only as "the man with bandaged hands," proves endearing despite the fact that his actions are not always virtuous. hana remembers that, in his burglaries, [CHARACTER] was always distracted by "the human element"--an advent calendar that was not open to the right day, for example. [CHARACTER] serves as a kind of surrogate father to hana, and sheds light on the identity of the english patient.
