[CHARACTER] - 
                a
lord of lagado, capital of the underdeveloped land beneath laputa,
who hosts gulliver and gives him a tour of the country on gulliver's
third voyage. munodi is a rare example of practical-minded intelligence
both in lagado, where the applied sciences are wildly impractical,
and in laputa, where no one even considers practicality a virtue.
he fell from grace with the ruling elite by counseling a commonsense approach
to agriculture and land management in lagado, an approach that was
rejected even though it proved successful when applied to his own
flourishing estate. [CHARACTER] serves as a reality check for gulliver
on his third voyage, an objective-minded contrast to the theoretical
delusions of the other inhabitants of laputa and lagado.
