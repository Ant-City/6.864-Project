     a room in volpone's house.

     enter volpone and mosca.

     volp: good morning to the day; and next, my gold:
     open the shrine, that i may see my saint.
     [mosca withdraws the curtain, and discovers piles of gold,
     plate, jewels, etc.]
     hail the world's soul, and mine! more glad than is
     the teeming earth to see the long'd-for sun
     peep through the horns of the celestial ram,
     am i, to view thy splendour darkening his;
     that lying here, amongst my other hoards,
     shew'st like a flame by night; or like the day

h are thy beauties and our loves! dear saint,
     riches, the dumb god, that giv'st all men tongues;
     that canst do nought, and yet mak'st men do all things;
     the price of souls; even hell, with thee to boot,
     is made worth heaven. thou art virtue, fame,
     honour, and all things else. who can get thee,
     he shall be noble, valiant, honest, wise,--

     mos: and what he will, sir. riches are in fortune
     a greater good than wisdom is in nature.

     volp: true, my beloved mosca. yet i glory
     more in the cunning purchase of my wealth,
     than in the glad possession; since i gain
     no common way; i use no trade, no venture;
     i wound no earth with plough-shares; fat no beasts,
     to feed the shambles; have no mills for iron,
     oil, corn, or men, to grind them into powder:
     i blow no subtle glass; expose no ships
     to threat'nings of the furrow-faced sea;
     i turn no monies in the public bank,
     nor usure private.

     may be forth-coming, when the flesh is rotten:
     but your sweet nature doth abhor these courses;
     you lothe the widdow's or the orphan's tears
     should wash your pavements, or their piteous cries
     ring in your roofs, and beat the air for vengeance.

     volp: right, mosca; i do lothe it.

     mos: and besides, sir,
     you are not like a thresher that doth stand
     with a huge flail, watching a heap of corn,
     and, hungry, dares not taste the smallest grain,
     but feeds on mallows, and such bitter herbs;

     and am content to coin them into profit,

     and look on that; still bearing them in hand,

     nan: now, room for fresh gamesters, who do will you to know,
     they do bring you neither play, nor university show;
     and therefore do entreat you, that whatsoever they rehearse,
     may not fare a whit the worse, for the false pace of the verse.

     this learned opinion we celebrate will,
     fellow eunuch, as behoves us, with all our wit and art,
     to dignify that whereof ourselves are so great and special a part.

     volp: now, very, very pretty! mosca, this

     mos: if it please my patron,
