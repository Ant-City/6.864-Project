or lose. iâ€™m sorry that i canâ€™t provide any drama in this respect; if i did,
it would not be true. we could tell, however, when debate became more
acrimonious than professional, but this was from watching lawyers other than our
father. i never heard atticus raise his voice in my life, except to a deaf witness.
mr. gilmer was doing his job, as atticus was doing his. besides, mr. ewell was
mr. gilmerâ€™s witness, and he had no business being rude to him of all people.
â€œare you the father of mayella ewell?â€ was the next question.
â€œwell, if i ainâ€™t i canâ€™t do nothing about it now, her maâ€™s dead,â€ was the answer.
judge taylor stirred. he turned slowly in his swivel chair and looked benignly at
the witness. â€œare you the father of mayella ewell?â€ he asked, in a way that made
the laughter below us stop suddenly.
â€œyes sir,â€ mr. ewell said meekly.
judge taylor went on in tones of good will: â€œthis the first time youâ€™ve ever been
in court? i donâ€™t recall ever seeing you here.â€

â€œno suh, not after she offered me a nickel the first time. i was glad to do it, mr.
ewell didnâ€™t seem to help her none, and neither did the chillun, and i knowed she
didnâ€™t have no nickels to spare.â€
â€œwhere were the other children?â€
â€œthey was always around, all over the place. theyâ€™d watch me work, some of
â€˜em, some of â€™emâ€™d set in the window.â€
â€œwould miss mayella talk to you?â€
â€œyes sir, she talked to me.â€
as tom robinson gave his testimony, it came to me that mayella ewell must
have been the loneliest person in the world. she was even lonelier than boo
radley, who had not been out of the house in twenty-five years. when atticus
asked had she any friends, she seemed not to know what he meant, then she
thought he was making fun of her. she was as sad, i thought, as what jem called a
mixed child: white people wouldnâ€™t have anything to do with her because she
lived among pigs; negroes wouldnâ€™t have anything to do with her because she
was white. she couldnâ€™t liv

hen i say it mr. ewell yonder hollered through thâ€™ window.â€
â€œwhat did he say?â€
tom robinson swallowed again, and his eyes widened. â€œsomethinâ€˜ not fittinâ€™ to
sayâ€”not fittinâ€˜ for these folksâ€™n chillun to hearâ€”â€
â€œwhat did he say, tom? you must tell the jury what he said.â€
tom robinson shut his eyes tight. â€œhe says you goddamn whore, iâ€™ll kill ya.â€
â€œthen what happened?â€
â€œmr. finch, i was runninâ€˜ so fast i didnâ€™t know what happened.â€
â€œtom, did you rape mayella ewell?â€
â€œi did not, suh.â€
â€œdid you harm her in any way?â€
â€œi did not, suh.â€
â€œdid you resist her advances?â€
â€œmr. finch, i tried. i tried to â€˜thout beinâ€™ ugly to her. i didnâ€™t wanta be ugly, i
didnâ€™t wanta push her or nothinâ€˜.â€
it occurred to me that in their own way, tom robinsonâ€™s manners were as good
as atticusâ€™s. until my father explained it to me later, i did not understand the
subtlety of tomâ€™s predicament: he would not have dared strike a white woman
under an

e when you got through with him?â€
â€œhe beat me, mr. gilmer.â€
â€œyes, but you were convicted, werenâ€™t you?â€
atticus raised his head. â€œit was a misdemeanor and itâ€™s in the record, judge.â€ i
thought he sounded tired.

â€œwitnessâ€™ll answer, though,â€ said judge taylor, just as wearily.
â€œyes suh, i got thirty days.â€
i knew that mr. gilmer would sincerely tell the jury that anyone who was
convicted of disorderly conduct could easily have had it in his heart to take
advantage of mayella ewell, that was the only reason he cared. reasons like that
helped.
â€œrobinson, youâ€™re pretty good at busting up chiffarobes and kindling with one
hand, arenâ€™t you?â€
â€œyes, suh, i reckon so.â€
â€œstrong enough to choke the breath out of a woman and sling her to the floor?â€
â€œi never done that, suh.â€
â€œbut you are strong enough to?â€
â€œi reckon so, suh.â€
â€œhad your eye on her a long time, hadnâ€™t you, boy?â€
â€œno suh, i never looked at her.â€
â€œthen you were mighty polite to d

 daily reminder of what
she did. what did she do? she tempted a negro.
â€œshe was white, and she tempted a negro. she did something that in our society is
unspeakable: she kissed a black man. not an old uncle, but a strong young negro
man. no code mattered to her before she broke it, but it came crashing down on
her afterwards.

â€œher father saw it, and the defendant has testified as to his remarks. what did her
father do? we donâ€™t know, but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that
mayella ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with
his left. we do know in part what mr. ewell did: he did what any god-fearing,
persevering, respectable white man would do under the circumstancesâ€”he swore
out a warrant, no doubt signing it with his left hand, and tom robinson now sits
before you, having taken the oath with the only good hand he possessesâ€”his right
hand.
â€œand so a quiet, respectable, humble negro who had the unmitigated temerity to
â€˜feel sorryâ€™ for a white

u, and we think you oughta do
something about him.â€
atticus smiled wryly. â€œdo what? put him under a peace bond?â€
â€œwhen a man says heâ€™s gonna get you, looks like he means it.â€
â€œhe meant it when he said it,â€ said atticus. â€œjem, see if you can stand in bob
ewellâ€™s shoes a minute. i destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he
had any to begin with. the man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind
always does. so if spitting in my face and threatening me saved mayella ewell
one extra beating, thatâ€™s something iâ€™ll gladly take. he had to take it out on
somebody and iâ€™d rather it be me than that houseful of children out there. you
understand?â€
jem nodded.
aunt alexandra entered the room as atticus was saying, â€œwe donâ€™t have anything
to fear from bob ewell, he got it all out of his system that morning.â€
â€œi wouldnâ€™t be so sure of that, atticus,â€ she said. â€œhis kindâ€™d do anything to pay
off a grudge. you know how those people are.â€

how could this be so, i wondered, as i read mr. underwoodâ€™s editorial. senseless
killingâ€”tom had been given due process of law to the day of his death; he had
been tried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true; my father had
fought for him all the way. then mr. underwoodâ€™s meaning became clear:
atticus had used every tool available to free men to save tom robinson, but in
the secret courts of menâ€™s hearts atticus had no case. tom was a dead man the
minute mayella ewell opened her mouth and screamed.
the name ewell gave me a queasy feeling. maycomb had lost no time in getting
mr. ewellâ€™s views on tomâ€™s demise and passing them along through that english
channel of gossip, miss stephanie crawford. miss stephanie told aunt
alexandra in jemâ€™s presence (â€œoh foot, heâ€™s old enough to listen.â€) that mr.
ewell said it made one down and about two more to go. jem told me not to be
afraid, mr. ewell was more hot gas than anything. jem also told me that if i
