d with a desire to eat. then they felt magnanimous and decided to put the angel on a raft with fresh water and provisions for three days and leave him to his fate on the high seas. but when they went out into the courtyard with the first light of dawn, they found the whole neighborhood in front of the chicken coop having fun with the angel, without the slightest reverence, tossing him things to eat through the openings in the wire as if he weren’t a supernatural creature but a circus animal.

father gonzaga arrived before seven o’clock, alarmed at the strange news. by that time onlookers less frivolous than those at dawn had already arrived and they were making all kinds of conjectures concerning the captive’s future. the simplest among them thought that he should be named mayor of the world. others of sterner mind felt that he should be promoted to the rank of five-star general in order to win all wars. some visionaries hoped that he could be put to stud in order to implant the earth a race o

f winged wise men who could take charge of the universe. but father gonzaga, before becoming a priest, had been a robust woodcutter. standing by the wire, he reviewed his catechism in an instant and asked them to open the door so that he could take a close look at that pitiful man who looked more like a huge decrepit hen among the fascinated chickens. he was lying in the corner drying his open wings in the sunlight among the fruit peels and breakfast leftovers that the early risers had thrown him. alien to the impertinences of the world, he only lifted his antiquarian

eyes and murmured something in his dialect when father gonzaga went into the chicken coop and said good morning to him in latin. the parish priest had his first suspicion of an imposter when he saw that he did not understand the language of god or know how to greet his ministers. then he noticed that seen close up he was much too human: he had an unbearable smell of the outdoors, the back side of his wings was strewn with parasites and his main feathers had been mistreated by terrestrial winds, and nothing about him measured up to the proud dignity of ange

he awoke with a start, ranting in his hermetic language and with tears in his eyes, and he flapped his wings a couple of times, which brought on a whirlwind of chicken dung and lunar dust and a gale of panic that did not seem to be of this world. although many thought that his reaction had not been one of rage but of pain, from then on they were careful not to annoy him, because the majority understood that his passivity was not that of a hero taking his ease but that of a cataclysm in repose.

father gonzaga held back the crowd’s frivolity with formulas of maidservant inspiration while awaiting the arrival of a final judgment on the nature of the captive. but the mail from rome showed no sense of urgency. they spent their time finding out if the prisoner had a navel, if his dialect had any connection with aramaic, how many times he could fit on the head of a pin, or whether he wasn’t just a norwegian with wings. those meager letters might have come and gone until the end of time if a providenti

d to look at mortals. besides, the few miracles attributed to the angel showed a certain mental disorder, like the blind man who didn’t recover his sight but grew three new teeth, or the paralytic who didn’t get to walk but almost won the lottery, and the leper whose sores sprouted sunflowers. those consolation miracles, which were more like mocking fun, had already ruined the angel’s reputation when the woman who had been changed into a spider finally crushed him completely. that was how father gonzaga was cured forever of his insomnia and pelayo’s courtyard went back to being as empty as during the time it had rained for three days and crabs walked through the bedrooms.

the owners of the house had no reason to lament. with the money they saved they built a two-story mansion with balconies and gardens and high netting so that crabs wouldn’t get in during the winter, and with iron bars on the windows so that angels wouldn’t get in. pelayo also set up a rabbit warren close to town and ga
