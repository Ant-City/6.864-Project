she flicked her wrist neatly out of doctor harry’s pudgy careful fingers and pulled 
the sheet up to her chin. the brat ought to be in knee breeches. doctoring around the 
country with spectacles on his nose! “get along now, take your schoolbooks and go. 
there’s nothing wrong with me.” 

doctor harry spread a warm paw like a cushion on her forehead where the forked 

green vein danced and made her eyelids twitch. “now, now, be a good girl, and we’ll 
have you up in no time.” 

“that’s no way to speak to a woman nearly eighty years old just because she’s 

down. i’d have you respect your elders,  young man.” 

“well, missy, excuse me.” doctor harry patted her cheek. “but i’ve got to warm 

you, haven’t i? you’re a marvel, but you must be careful or you’re going

to be good 
and sorry.” 

“don’t tell me what i’m going to be. i’m on my feet now, morally speaking. it’s 

cornelia. i had to go to bed to get rid of her.” 

her bones felt loose, and floated around in her skin, and doctor harry floated like 

a balloon around the foot of the bed. 

he floated and pulled down his waistcoat and swung his glasses on a cord. “well, 

stay where you are, it certainly can’t hurt you.” 

“get along and doctor your sick,” said granny weatherall. “leave a well woman 

alone. i’ll call for you when i want you… where were you forty years ago when i pulled 
through milk-leg2 and double pneumonia? you weren’t even born. don’t let cornelia 
lead you on,” she shouted, because d

she meant to wave good-by, but it was too much trouble. her eyes closed of 
themselves, it was like a dark curtain drawn around the bed. the pillow rose and 
floated under her, pleasant as a hammock in a light wind. she listened to the leaves 
rustling outside the window. no, somebody was swishing newspapers: no, cornelia 
and doctor harry werewhisperingtogether. she leaped broad awake, thinking they 
whispered in her ear. 

“she was never like this, never like this!” “well, what can we expect?” “yes, 

eighty years old….”

well, and what if she was? she still had ears. it was like cornelia to whisper 
around doors. she always kept things secret in such a public way. she was always 
being tactful and kind. cornelia was dutiful; that was the trouble with her. dutiful and

he did? there was the day, the day, but a 
whirl of dark smoke rose and covered it, crept up and over into the bright field where 
everything was planted so carefully in orderly rows. that was hell, she knew hell when 
she saw it. for sixty years she had prayed against remembering him and against losing 
her soul in the deep pit of hell, and now the two things were mingled in one and the 
thought of him was a smoking cloud from hell that moved and crept in her head when 
she had just got rid of doctor harry and was trying to rest a minute: wounded vanity, 
ellen, said a sharp voice in the top of her mind. don’t let your wounded vanity get the

upper hand of you. plenty of girls get jilted. you were jilted, weren’t you? then stand 
up to it. her eyelids wavered and let in streamers of blue-gray light like tissue paper 
over her eyes. she must get up and pull the shades down or she’d never sleep. she was 
in bed again and the shades were not down. h

face, child, you look funny. 

instead of obeying, cornelia knelt down and put her head on the pillow. she 

seemed to be talking but there was no sound. 

“well, are you tongue-tied? whose birthday is it? are you going to give a party?” 

cornelia’s mouth moved urgently in strange shapes. “don’t do that, you bother 

me, daughter.” 

“oh, no, mother, oh, no…” 

nonsense. it was strange about children. they disputed your every word. “no 

what, cornelia?” 

“here’s doctor harry.” 

“i won’t see that boy again. he just left five minutes ago.” 

“that was this morning, mother. it’s night now. here’s the nurse.” 

“this is doctor harry, mrs. weatherall. i never saw you look so young and happy!” 

“ah, i’ll never be young again – but i’d be happy if they’d let me be in peace and 

get rested.” 

she thought she spoke up loudly, but no one answered. a warm weight on her 

forehead, a warm bracelet on her wrist, and a breeze went on whisperin

ry black when they should have been blue. you never saw him, 
so how do you know how he looked? but the man insisted the copy was perfect, it was 
very rich and handsome. for a picture, yes, but it’s not my husband. the table by the 
bed had a linen cover and a candle and a crucifix. the light was blue from cornelia’s 
silk lampshades. no sort of light at all, just frippery.4 you had to live forty years with 
kerosene lamps to appreciate honest electricity. she felt very strong and she saw 
doctor harry with a rosy nimbus around him. 

“you look like a saint, doctor harry, and i vow that’s as near as you’ll ever dome 

to it.” 

“she’s saying something.” 

“i heard you, cornelia. what’s all this carrying-on?” 

“father connolly’s saying –“ 

cornelia’s voice staggered and bumped like a cart in a bad road. it rounded 

corners and turned back again and arrived nowhere. granny stepped up in the cart 
very lightly and reached for the reins, but a man sat beside her a

fumbled together, and granny closed two fingers around jimmy’s thumb. beads 
wouldn’t do it, it must be something alive. she was so amazed her thoughts ran round 
and round. so, my dear lord, this is my death and i wasn’t even thinking about it. my 
children have come to see me die. but i can’t, it’s not time. oh, i always hated 
surprises. i wanted to give cornelia the amethyst set – cornelia, you’re to have the 
amethyst set, but hapsy’ to wear it when she wants, and, doctor harry, do shut up. 
nobody sent for you. oh, my dear lord, do wait a minute. i meant to do something 
about the forty acres, jimmy doesn’t need it and lydia will later on, with that 
worthless husband of hers. i meant to finish the altar cloth and send six bottles of wine 
to sister borgia for her dyspepsia. i want to send six bottles of wine to sister borgia, 
father connolly, now don’t let me forget. 
cornelia’s voice made short turns and tilted over and crashed. “oh, mother, oh,
