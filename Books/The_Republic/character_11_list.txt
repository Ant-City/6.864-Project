Imagination - 
                Imagination
is the lowest grade of cognitive activity. Someone in the state
of imagination takes mere images and shadows as the most real things.
Probably, this means that such a person derives his ideas about himself
and the world from products of art, such as poetry in Plato's day
and movies and television in our own. See also Belief, Thought,
Understanding.
