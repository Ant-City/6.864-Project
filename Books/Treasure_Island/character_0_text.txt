a trump,
i perceive. hawkins, will you ring that bell? mr. dance must have some
ale."

"and so, jim," said the doctor, "you have the thing that they were
after, have you?"

"here it is, sir," said i, and gave him the oilskin packet.

the doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open
it; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his
coat.

"squire," said he, "when dance has had his ale he must, of course, be
off on his majesty's service; but i mean to keep jim hawkins here to
sleep at my house, and with your permission, i propose we should have up
the cold pie and let him sup."

"as you will, livesey," said the squire; "hawkins has earned better than
cold pie."

so a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable, and i made
a hearty supper, for i was as hungry as a hawk, while mr. dance was
further complimented and at last dismissed.

"and now, squire," said the doctor.

"and now, livesey," said the squire in the same breath.

"one at a time, one at a

is: i think
it handsome. and if you think as i do, you'll give a good sea-cheer for
the gentleman that does it."

the cheer followed--that was a matter of course; but it rang out so full
and hearty that i confess i could hardly believe these same men were
plotting for our blood.

"one more cheer for cap'n smollett," cried long john when the first had
subsided.

and this also was given with a will.

on the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after,
word was sent forward that jim hawkins was wanted in the cabin.

i found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of spanish wine
and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig
on his lap, and that, i knew, was a sign that he was agitated. the stern
window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon
shining behind on the ship's wake.

"now, hawkins," said the squire, "you have something to say. speak up."

i did as i was bid, and as short as i could make it, told the whole
details of

e--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two
boats went ashore from the hispaniola. the captain, the squire, and i
were talking matters over in the cabin. had there been a breath of wind,
we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with
us, slipped our cable, and away to sea. but the wind was wanting; and
to complete our helplessness, down came hunter with the news that jim
hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest.

it never occurred to us to doubt jim hawkins, but we were alarmed for
his safety. with the men in the temper they were in, it seemed an even
chance if we should see the lad again. we ran on deck. the pitch was
bubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick;
if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was in that abominable
anchorage. the six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the
forecastle; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting
in each, hard by where the river runs in. one of them wa

cy was the spring. for though we had a good
enough place of it in the cabin of the hispaniola, with plenty of arms
and ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been
one thing overlooked--we had no water. i was thinking this over when
there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of
death. i was not new to violent death--i have served his royal highness
the duke of cumberland, and got a wound myself at fontenoy--but i know
my pulse went dot and carry one. "jim hawkins is gone," was my first
thought.

it is something to have been an old soldier, but more still to have been
a doctor. there is no time to dilly-dally in our work. and so now i made
up my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and
jumped on board the jolly-boat.

by good fortune hunter pulled a good oar. we made the water fly, and the
boat was soon alongside and i aboard the schooner.

i found them all shaken, as was natural. the squire was sitting down, as
white as a sheet, t

"somebody hailing us," said hunter, who was on guard.

"doctor! squire! captain! hullo, hunter, is that you?" came the cries.

and i ran to the door in time to see jim hawkins, safe and sound, come
climbing over the stockade.

the woods in the great attack, and doubted not that this was he.

the parrot sat, preening her plumage, on long john's shoulder. he
himself, i thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than i was used
to. he still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his
mission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and
torn with the sharp briers of the wood.

"so," said he, "here's jim hawkins, shiver my timbers! dropped in, like,
eh? well, come, i take that friendly."

and thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a
pipe.

"give me a loan of the link, dick," said he; and then, when he had a
good light, "that'll do, lad," he added; "stick the glim in the wood
heap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! you needn't stand up
for mr. hawkins; he'll excuse you, you may lay to that. and so,

could not, for the life of me, decide whether he were laughing at my
request or had been favourably affected by my courage.

"i'll put one to that," cried the old mahogany-faced seaman--morgan
by name--whom i had seen in long john's public-house upon the quays of
bristol. "it was him that knowed black dog."

"well, and see here," added the sea-cook. "i'll put another again to
that, by thunder! for it was this same boy that faked the chart from
billy bones. first and last, we've split upon jim hawkins!"

"then here goes!" said morgan with an oath.

and he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty.

"avast, there!" cried silver. "who are you, tom morgan? maybe you
thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. by the powers, but i'll teach you
better! cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you,

th an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking,
yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and
disappeared out of the house. one after another the rest followed his
example, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology.
"according to rules," said one. "forecastle council," said morgan. and
so with one remark or another all marched out and left silver and me
alone with the torch.

the sea-cook instantly removed his pipe.

"now, look you here, jim hawkins," he said in a steady whisper that was
no more than audible, "you're within half a plank of death, and what's
a long sight worse, of torture. they're going to throw me off. but, you
mark, i stand by you through thick and thin. i didn't mean to; no, not

be hanged into the bargain. but i see you was the right sort. i says to

i began dimly to understand.

"you mean all's lost?" i asked.

"aye, by gum, i do!" he answered. "ship gone, neck gone--that's the
size of it. once i looked into that bay, jim hawkins, and seen no
schooner--well, i'm tough, but i gave out. as for that lot and their
council, mark me, they're outright fools and cowards. i'll save your
life--if so be as i can--from them. but, see here, jim--tit for tat--you
save long john from swinging."

i was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking--he, the
old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout.

"what i can do, that i'll do," i said.

"it's a bargain!" cried long john. "you speak up plucky, and by thunder,
i've a chance!"
