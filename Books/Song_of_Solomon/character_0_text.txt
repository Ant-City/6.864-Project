milkman dead: an anti-classical hero
many scholars approaching toni morrison’s song of solomon (new york:
knopf, 1977) have tried to explain the novel in traditional mythological
terms. they place milkman’s birth in the company of those of moses, king
arthur, achilles, prometheus, and other legendary figures treated by lord
raglan in the hero and by joseph campbell in the hero with a thousand
faces.
1 when parallels to these leave off, they turn to heroic patterns derived
from classical greek and roman

pauline and the journey inward for pecola both backfired. sula’s wandering
can also be viewed as an aborted attempt to find meaning in her existence;
unable to do so on southern or northern soil, she returns to her home in
the north, more out of resignation than accomplishment. in her first two
novels, therefore, morrison depicts no pattern of seeking that leads to contentment
for her characters. they are driven, disturbed, unsettled from the
beginnings to the ends of their journeys. with milkman dead in song of
solomon, morrison culminates her pattern of reversal and simultaneously
allows milkman to find meaning in a territory that her previous characters
have shunned or escaped.
few characters in african-american literature chart their courses from
north to south, for the myth informing their actions invariably pictured the
north as the freer place, where money was plentiful and liberty unchallenged.
so they usually went north, to that earthly land of milk and honey.17 in song

therefore, morrison debunks one myth and creates another. born
in the north, and heir to the material advantages that generations of blacks
identified with that territory, milkman dead must find meaning for his life
by reversing the pattern, by going south, back into the territory of his ancestors.
there must also be a reversal in his expectations on that soil. initially, he
goes searching for gold, as many generations of blacks came north in hopes
of improving their material wealth. but the south is not the land of riches,
of physical, tangible goods waiting for those seeking their fortunes. it is the
land of blood and death, of slavery, of countless generations of africans

and familial heritage that goes back to africa, and they represent, in their
various states of development, some portion of his grandfather’s journey from
virginia to pennsylvania. the first macon dead’s hope for better things drove
him from the stifling south, a hope shared by the people who are still living
there and being similarly stifled by poverty. and his travel on a wagon, so far
distant psychologically and economically from milkman dead, reflects the
very soil and work to which the people of shalimar are rooted. milkman has
been shocked into the recognition that he will not be allowed to break the
circle of connectedness extending generations before his own existence.
his rediscovery of his humanity makes him sensitive enough to susan
byrd’s information to realize that the children in shalimar are singing about
his great-grandmother, ryna, and his great-grandfather, solomon. he deciphers

while claudia in the bluest eye and nel in sula are too late to change
what has happened in their lives, milkman dead, in morrison’s third novel,
song of solomon, completes a heroic quest for an identity and place within the
community. morrison depicts milkman in mythic terms. not only does his
story follow a cohesive pattern of miraculous birth, youth/alienation, quest,
confrontation, and reintegration into community, but morrison also infuses
it with both western and african-american myths which blend together
the mundane with the magical and the factual with the fantastic. morrison

in 1977, highlights the search for african-american roots. if in
song of solomon, as in sula, morrison is intent on extending the africanamerican
literary and cultural imagination, she also stages troubling scenes
of shame and trauma in song of solomon as she explores the shame–pride
issues surrounding the construction of black masculinity and reflects on the
competing and contradictory political ideologies of assimilation and black
nationalism. song of solomon tells the story of milkman dead, a member
of the black bourgeoisie and a shame-ridden individual who carries with
him the “shit” not only of his family’s false class pride but also of inherited
familial and racial shame. before the middle-class, urban milkman can
attempt to “fly”—that is, feel healthy family and racial pride—he must learn
about the interrelated shame–pride sources of black masculinity through his
contact with the black underclass in his michigan hometown and in the
rural south where he learns

 kind of amnesia about their cultural history—about the
shame and trauma of family histories rooted in slavery—and who, in donning
the mask of bourgeois (white-identified) “pride,” come to see poor blacks as
stigmatized objects of contempt. like the bluest eye and sula, song of solomon
deals with the troubling issue of internalized racism as it crystallizes
black cultural anxiety about the class and color hierarchies within the african-american
community. morrison deliberately typecasts milkman dead
as a privileged, middle-class african american only to strip away his mantle
of false class pride by putting him in vital contact with the black folk, people
like his aunt pilate or his poor southern relations whom he originally sees
through the lens of internalized racism as the shameful and inferior other. if
part of the novel’s agenda is to show how milkman dead is brought to a new
and healing sense of racial consciousness as a result of both his association
with the black underclass and h

by shame, feels the incipient fire of shame-rage burning within her. after
hagar sees milkman with his arms around the shoulders of a light-skinned
woman—a woman with silky copper-colored hair and gray eyes—she experiences
both shame-depression and shame-rage. the lovelorn hagar becomes

but even without a consideration of the way her third novel gives access to a
portion of her aesthetic autobiography, one can still acknowledge that song of
solomon intensely foregrounds the processes of identity formation in the novel’s
central character, milkman dead. it does so, unlike her first two novels,
on decidedly male grounds. from the novel’s one-word dedication (daddy),
morrison draws upon a transfigured representation of her own family history,
emphasizing male genealogy. the novel’s very title derives from what
morrison herself has called the “genuinely autobiographical,” as i discussed
in chapter 1, since her maternal grandfather was john solomon willis.1 the
portrait of “lincoln’s heaven,” the farm that had belonged to milkman’

think i call [the setting] michigan; they sort of travel around a little bit. but

all of mine start here in the midwest!” (39). milkman’s michigan, morrison’s
comment suggests, is but a minor displacement from the novelist’s ohio and
her own working-class, great lakes town of lorain. yet although morrison
metaphorically stays at home, leaving home is precisely what milkman dead
thinks he wants.
in this regard, song of solomon participates in and arguably completes
morrison’s fictive meditation on those aspects of authorship that are linked
to the cultural masculine. soaphead church opens the space of writerly selfexamination;
shadrack pushes this reflexive examination into the realm of
communal ritual. but morrison’s third novel is a departure from the first two

in her master’s thesis, morrison’s characterization of thomas sutpen’s and
quentin compson’s alienated relation to history also accurately describes
isaac mccaslin’s alienation from his past as he comes of age in a defeated
south and discovers in the ledgers the horror of his grandfather’s incest and
miscegenation (“alienation” 24). her own character, milkman dead, in song

of solomon, similarly comes of age alienated from his family’s history, almost
as a result, one might say, of patriarchs such as lucius quintus carothers
mccaslin, whose forced mixture of the races in mississippi results in the
special status accorded lighter-skinned african americans in milkman
dead’s michigan. in other words, ike’s family problem, as he confronts the
racism of the white community, is too much history; milkman’s difficulty in

a number of other parallels invite a consideration of these two narratives
together. in both novels, the male protagonists apparently come to
some transcendent moment while hunting, for hunting is something more
than the literal stalking of animals; the hunted animals in both are totemic
substitutes for characters. both novels blur boundaries between the natural
and supernatural worlds. but perhaps most important, the creation of the
adult subjectivity of isaac mccaslin in go down, moses and milkman dead
in song of solomon serves as the site of conflict and competition. certainly
those who struggle to create isaac’s and milkman’s subjectivities bear certain
parallels. macon dead, for example, approximates mccaslin edmonds, while
guitar and pilate split the function of sam fathers.9
in go down, moses, mccaslin edmonds speaks the paternal voice of
the old south, inviting isaac to take his rightful place in l. q. c. mccaslin’s
patriarchal design. similarly, macon hopes to create in milkman a

if all he learned was that his great-grandfather reputedly could fly, then
milkman’s joy at the novel’s ending would be trivial. song of solomon, morrison’s
first novel to foreground the activity of men, however, raises a tough
question—one that cannot be answered fully by one novel: is it possible for
african-american men to reconceive their masculinity in a nonpatriarchal
fashion, that is, in a way that does not reduce african-american women
to objects of possession? the example of milkman dead suggests that the

possibility is open for such a reconception. ike mccaslin fails to provide the
key to a nonpatriarchal society because his renunciation—his refusal to profit
from a system of male power that perpetuates racial injustice—is just that,
simple negation and refusal, a withdrawal from life. he generates no alternative
vision of how to live in the world, and the transmission of patriarchal
authority is in no

hong kingston’s china men, leslie marmon silko’s ceremony, and peter
najerian’s voyages. in such novels, “characters’ self-hatred and angry confusion
are related to a historic dispossession and to a psyche cut off from
ancestral or communal wellsprings; their narratives chart a moving and
powerful repossession of selfhood, articulating personal well-being in terms
of the collective.” song of solomon, examines a similar theme through the
character of milkman dead, a young midwesterner who travels alone to
a rural community in the blue ridge mountains, the locus of his paternal
ancestry. milkman’s trip to the south has been the subject of a significant
amount of critical inquiry. most critics have focused on the final section of
the novel, framed by milkman’s searching for mythical gold and his ultimate
enthusiasm for discovering the oral history of his family. stephanie a.
demetrakopoulos views milkman’s flight to the south in quest of gold as an

hrough his connection to a human community. “the
entire novel is about the interdependence of individuals and the insurance
of mutual life; redemption cannot be individual,” grewal writes. this statement
brings to mind farmer-writer wendell berry’s emphasis on holistic
health care, his belief that “the community—in the fullest sense: a place
and all its creatures—is the smallest unit of health and that to speak of the
health of an isolated individual is a contradiction in terms.”8
milkman dead certainly undergoes a change in attitude while visiting
his ancestral homeland, and yes, this shift is linked to his establishing
roots—an understanding of familial cultural continuity—where none existed
before. my intrigue, however, lies in the echoes of american “nature writing”
that i detect in morrison’s prose. to what extent is milkman’s “regenerative
moment” in the virginia woodlands a sincere expression of natural mysticism
or, conversely, a parody of the american gesture

the nuclear family that surrounds milkman, however, seems highly problematic.
like many of the fathers in faulkner’s fiction, macon dead simply
cannot provide the sort of emotional support that his son requires. in her
thesis, morrison says that quentin “is estranged from his father because of
the great distance between their points of view” (30). although one might
say the same of macon and milkman dead, and ruth dead likewise exists
as a shadow that rivals mrs. compson’s ephemeral nature, morrison provides
milkman with an alternative familial figure of authority in his aunt, pilate.
her influence most usefully guides milkman as he quests after the specifics
of his history, possibly because morrison makes her representative of that
history. she introduces him to the knowledge that allows him to “fly” and,
as john n. duvall notes, this kind of flying involves “the ability to transcend

of her thesis” (679).
5. as vendrame points out, “in morrison’s work, history emerges as a nurturing
cultural foundation from the dialogic interaction between milkman’s search for
himself and an obscure mythical past. while faulkner in his treatment of southern
history seems willing to maintain uncertainties and constantly evades closure, morrison
establishes a point of intersection between the different voices in a commitment
to recover and rewrite milkman’s family history. thus, milkman dead not
only repossesses his past, but also restores its meaning through the re-actualization
of his family’s mythical heritage” (684).
6. in the neustadt interview at bryn mawr, morrison explained the significance
of solomon’s song as a personal oral history: “the song of solomon: there’s a
song like that in my family. i don’t know all the lyrics but it starts with a line like
‘green, the only son of solomon,’ and then some words i don’t understand, but it is
a genealogy” (90).

 times: odysseus does indeed become no man, the name he uses to trick
the cyclops, when he arrives home as a nameless beggar; in morrison’s
novel the man whose name is changed to macon dead is murdered, and his
descendants transfixed in a spiritual death. names in song of solomon are
deeply implicated in issues of narrativity: this is a story about naming, and
its characters frequently bear names which denote their narrative function,
for example pilate, who acts as a guide to the protagonist milkman dead, or
sweet, the woman he wins after completing his ordeal in shalimar. certain
names allude to other stories: hagar, ruth, rebecca, and first corinthians
have obvious biblical associations in keeping with the novel’s title. the midwife,
circe, a pivotal figure in the puzzles of naming and narrative around
which the novel is structured, is the only character to bear a name from
greek mythology. yet while she so obviously signifies a homeric intertext

in this essay i focus on how morrison employs the figure of circe to
position her novel both within and beyond the classical tradition of the catabatic
narrative. toni morrison graduated with a minor in classics from howard
university in 1953, and it is obvious that her academic training informed
song of solomon.
2 this, her third novel, is distinguished from much of her other
work, which explores the experience of black american women, by its focus
on a central male character, milkman dead. milkman, the son of a prosperous
slumlord in an unnamed michigan city, is set on a quest for his history
and identity that leads him back to virginia and the gullah traditions of his
ancestors. that song of solomon is structured as an archetypal heroic saga was
immediately recognized when it made its debut in the late 1970s. in an early
essay on the novel, a. leslie harris identified a mythic structure that conforms
to the male initiatory pattern. harris’ analysis was exclusively concerned w
