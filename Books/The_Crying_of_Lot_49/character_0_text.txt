one summer afternoon mrs oedipa maas came home from a tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much 
kirsch in the fondue to find that she, oedipa, had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of one 
pierce inverarity, a california real estate mogul who had once lost two million collars in his spare time but still had assets 
numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary. oedipa stood in the living room, 
stared at by the greenish dead eye of the tv tube, spoke

t gennaro ends on a note most desperate, probably for its original audience a real shock, because it names at last the 
name angelo did not and niccol6 tried to: 
he that we last as thum and taxis knew now recks no lord but the stiletto's thorn, and tacit lies the gold once-knotted horn. no 
hallowed skein of stars can ward, i trow, who's once been set his tryst with trystero. / 
trystero. the word hung in the air as the act ended and all lights were for a moment cut; hung in the dark to puzzle oedipa maas, 
but not yet to exert the power over her it was to. 

 
the fifth act, entirely an anticlimax, is taken up by the bloodbath gennaro visits on the court of squamuglia. every mode of 

violent death available to renaissance man, including a lye pit, land mines, a trained falcon with envenom'd talons, is 
employed. it plays, as metzger remarked later, like a road runner cartoon in blank verse. at the end of it about the only 
character left alive in a stage dense with corpses is the colorless ad

ington? god protect me," he addressed the ceiling 
of the little theatre, causing a few heads among those leaving to swivel, "from these lib, overeducated broads with the soft heads and 
bleeding hearts. i am 35 years old, and i should know better." 

"metzger," oedipa whispered, embarrassed, "i'm a young republican." 
"hap harrigan comics," metzger now even louder, "which she is hardly old enough to read, john wayne on saturday 

afternoon slaughtering ten thousand japs with his teeth, this is oedipa maas's world war ii, man. some people today can drive 
vw's, cany a sony radio in their shirt pocket. not this one, folks, she wants to right wrongs, 20 years after it's all over. raise ghosts. 
all from a drunken hassle with manny di presso. forgetting her first loyalty, legal and moral, is to the estate she represents. not to 
our boys in uniform, however gallant, whenever they died." 

"it isn't that," she protested. "i don't care what beaconsfield uses in its filter. i don't care what pierce bou

of christian knowledge photo, showing maxwell in right profile, seemed to work best. 
oedipa, behind her shades, looked around carefully, trying not to move her head. nobody paid any attention to them: the 
air-conditioning hummed on, ibm typewriters chiggered away, swivel chairs squeaked, fat reference manuals were slammed 
shut, rattling blueprints folded and refolded, while high overhead the long silent fluorescent bulbs glared merrily; all with 
yoyodyne was normal. except right here, where oedipa maas, with a thousand other people to choose from, had had to walk 
uncoerced into the presence of madness. 

"not everybody can work it, of course," koteks, having warmed to his subject, was telling her. "only people with the 

gift. 'sensitives,' john calls them." 

oedipa rested her shades on her nose and batted her eyelashes, figuring to coquette her way off this conversational hook: 

"would i make a good sensitive, do think?" 
"you really want to try it? you could write to him. he only knows a

as appalled at the spectacle, having thought such traffic only possible in los 
angeles, places like that. looking down at san francisco a few minutes later from the high point of the bridge's arc, she saw 

smog. haze, she corrected herself, is what it is, haze. how can they have smog in san francisco? smog, according to the 
folklore, did not begin till farther south. it had to be the angle of the sun. 

amid the exhaust, sweat, glare and ill-humor of a summer evening on an american freeway, oedipa maas pondered her trystero 

problem. all the silence of san narciso—the calm surface of the motel pool, the contemplative contours of residential streets like 
rakings in the sand of a japanese garden—had not allowed her to think as leisurely as this freeway madness. 

for john nefastis (to take a recent example) two kinds of entropy, thermodynamic and informational, happened, say by 

coincidence, to look alike, when you wrote them down as equations. yet he had made his mere coincidence respec

 our 
climatic records of dreams and what dreams became among our accumulated daylight, a moment's squall-line or tornado's touchdown 
among the higher, more continental solemnities—storm-systems of group suffering and need, prevailing winds of affluence. there was 
the true continuity, san narciso had no boundaries. no one knew yet how to draw them. she had dedicated herself, weeks ago, to making 
sense of what inverarity had left behind, never suspecting that the legacy was america. 

might oedipa maas yet be his heiress; had that been in the will, in code, perhaps without pierce really knowing, having been by 
then too seized by some headlong expansion of himself, some visit, some lucid instruction? though she could never again call back any 
image of the dead man to dress up, pose, talk to and make answer, neither would she lose a new compassion for the cul-de-sac he'd tried 
to find a way out of, for the enigma his efforts had created. 

though he had never talked business with her, she ha
