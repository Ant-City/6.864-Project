parris: now, goody ann, they only thought that were a witch, and i am certain 
there be no element of witchcraft here. 
 
putnam: no witchcraft! now look you, mr. parris - 
 
parris: thomas, thomas, i pray you, leap not to witchcraft. i know that you - 
you least of all, thomas, would ever wish so disastrous a charge laid upon me. 
we  cannot  leap  to  witchcraft.  they  will  howl  me  out  of  salem  for  such 
corruption in my house. 
 

a word about thomas putnam. he was a man with many grievances, at least 
one  of  which  appears  justified.  some  time  before,  his  wife’s  brother-in-law, 
james bayley, had been turned down as minister of salem. bayley had all the 
qualifications, and a two-thirds vote into the bargain, but a faction stopped his 
acceptance, for reasons that are not clear. 

thomas putnam was the eldest son of the richest man in the village. he had 
fought the indians at narragansett, and was deeply interested in parish affairs

him. 

his  vindictive  nature  was  demonstrated  long  before  the  witch-craft  began. 
another former salem minister, george burroughs, had had to borrow money 
to pay for his wife’s funeral, and, since the parish was remiss in his salary, he 
was soon bankrupt. thomas and his brother john had burroughs jailed for debts 
the  man  did  not  owe.  the  incident  is  important  only  in  that  burroughs 
succeeded in becoming minister where bayley,

thomas putnam’s brother-in-law, had been rejected; the motif of resentment is 
clear here. thomas putnam felt that his own name and the honor of his family 
had  been  smirched  by  the  village,  and  he  meant  to  right  matters  however  he 
could. 

another  reason  to  believe  him  a  deeply  embittered  man  was  his  attempt to 
break his father’s will, which left a dispropor-tionate amount to a stepbrother. 
as with every other public cause in which he tried to force his way, he failed in

cis, is the land war he fought with his neighbors, one of whom 
was a putnam. this squabble grew to the proportions of a battle in the woods be-tween 
partisans of both sides, and it is said to have lasted for two days. as for rebecca herself, 
the general opinion of her character was so high that to explain how anyone dared cry 
her out for a witch - and more, how adults could bring them-selves to lay hands on her - 
we must look to the fields and boundaries of that time. 

as  we  have  seen, thomas putnam’s man for the salem min-istry was bayley. the 
nurse clan had been in the faction that prevented bayley’s taking office. in addition, 
certain  families  allied  to  the  nurses  by  blood  or  friendship,  and  whose  farms  were 
contiguous with the nurse farm or close to it, combined to break away from the salem 
town authority and set up tops-field, a new and independent entity whose existence was 
re-sented by old salemites.

soon  as  it  began,  this  topsfield-nurse  ’faction  absented  themselves  from  church  in 
protest  and  disbelief.  it  was  edward  and  jonathan  putnam  who  signed  the  first 
complaint against rebecca; and thomas putnam’s little daughter was the one who fell 
into  a  fit  at  the  hearing  and  pointed  to  rebecca  as  her  attacker.  to  top  it  all,  mrs. 
putnam - who is now staring at the bewitched child on the bed - soon accused rebecca’s 
spirit of “tempting her to iniquity,” a charge that had more truth in it than mrs. putnam 
could know,
