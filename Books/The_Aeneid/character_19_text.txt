  then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost;
  and here and there above the waves were seen
  arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.
  the stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,
  and suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea.
  ilioneus was her chief: alethes old,
  achates faithful, abas young and bold,
  endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams,
  admit the deluge of the briny streams.

  meantime imperial neptune heard the sound
  of raging billows breaking on the ground.
  displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign,
  he rear'd his awful head above the main,
  serene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes
  around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.
  he saw the trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd,
  by stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd.
  full well the god his sister's envy knew,
  and what her aims and what her arts pursue.
  he summon'd eurus and the western blast,

  "with such deceits he gain'd their easy hearts,
  too prone to credit his perfidious arts.
  what diomede, nor thetis' greater son,
  a thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done-
  false tears and fawning words the city won.

  "a greater omen, and of worse portent,

  laocoon, neptune's priest by lot that year,
  with solemn pomp then sacrific'd a steer;
  when, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied
  two serpents, rank'd abreast, the seas divide,
  and smoothly sweep along the swelling tide.
  their flaming crests above the waves they show;
  their bellies seem to burn the seas below;
  their speckled tails advance to steer their course,
  and on the sounding shore the flying billows force.

  in mournful pomp the matrons walk the round,
  with baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd,
  with eyes dejected, and with hair unbound.
  then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,
  and thrice invoke the soul of polydore.

  "now, when the raging storms no longer reign,
  but southern gales invite us to the main,
  we launch our vessels, with a prosp'rous wind,
  and leave the cities and the shores behind.

  "an island in th' aegaean main appears;

  it floated once, till phoebus fix'd the sides
  to rooted earth, and now it braves the tides.
  here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore,
  with needful ease our weary limbs restore,
  and the sun's temple and his town adore.

  "anius, the priest and king, with laurel crown'd,

  let us the land which heav'n appoints, explore;
  appease the winds, and seek the gnossian shore.

  thus having said, the sacrifices, laid
  on smoking altars, to the gods he paid:
  a bull, to neptune an oblation due,
  another bull to bright apollo slew;
  a milk-white ewe, the western winds to please,
  and one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas.
  ere this, a flying rumor had been spread
  that fierce idomeneus from crete was fled,
  expell'd and exil'd; that the coast was free
  from foreign or domestic enemy.

  "we leave the delian ports, and put to sea;

  he said, "and falling is to rise by you,
  what prize may nisus from your bounty claim,
  who merited the first rewards and fame?
  in falling, both an equal fortune tried;
  would fortune for my fall so well provide!"
  with this he pointed to his face, and show'd
  his hand and all his habit smear'd with blood.
  th' indulgent father of the people smil'd,
  and caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield,
  of wondrous art, by didymaon wrought,
  long since from neptune's bars in triumph brought.
  this giv'n to nisus, he divides the rest,
  and equal justice in his gifts express'd.

  the race thus ended, and rewards bestow'd,
  once more the prince bespeaks th' attentive crowd:
  "if there he here whose dauntless courage dare

  then from the pile a flaming fire she drew,
  and, toss'd in air, amidst the galleys threw.

  wrapp'd in amaze, the matrons wildly stare:

  on eryx's altars three fat calves he lays;
  a lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas;
  then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs.
  high on the deck the godlike hero stands,
  with olive crown'd, a charger in his hands;
  then cast the reeking entrails in the brine,
  and pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine.
  fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie,
  and brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly.

  meantime the mother goddess, full of fears,
  to neptune thus address'd, with tender tears:
  "the pride of jove's imperious queen, the rage,
  the malice which no suff'rings can assuage,
  compel me to these pray'rs; since neither fate,
  nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate:
  ev'n jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;
  still vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife.
  as if 't were little to consume the town
  which aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown,
  she prosecutes the ghost of troy with pains,

  for what remains, your godhead i implore,
  and trust my son to your protecting pow'r.
  if neither jove's nor fate's decree withstand,
  secure his passage to the latian land."

  then thus the mighty ruler of the main:
  "what may not venus hope from neptune's reign?
  my kingdom claims your birth; my late defense
  of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence.
  nor less by land than sea my deeds declare
  how much your lov'd aeneas is my care.

  their lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone
  shall perish, and for multitudes atone."
  thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind,
  his finny team saturnian neptune join'd,
  then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws,
  and to the loosen'd reins permits the laws.
  high on the waves his azure car he guides;
  its axles thunder, and the sea subsides,
  and the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.
  the tempests fly before their father's face,
  trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,
  and monster whales before their master play,

  scarce were his limbs extended at their length,
  the god, insulting with superior strength,
  fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea,
  and, with the stern, the rudder tore away.
  headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,
  cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.
  the victor daemon mounts obscure in air,
  while the ship sails without the pilot's care.
  on neptune's faith the floating fleet relies;
  but what the man forsook, the god supplies,
  and o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies;
  glides by the sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast,
  long infamous for ships and sailors lost,
  and white with bones. th' impetuous ocean roars,
  and rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.

  had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd.
  which monsters lest the trojans' pious host
  should bear, or touch upon th' inchanted coast,
  propitious neptune steer'd their course by night
  with rising gales that sped their happy flight.
  supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore,
  and hear the swelling surges vainly roar.
  now, when the rosy morn began to rise,
  and wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies;
  when thetis blush'd in purple not her own,
  and from her face the breathing winds were blown,
  a sudden silence sate upon the sea,
  and sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way.

  nor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field,

  such is the fierce encounter of the fleet.

  the fields of neptune take a purple dye.

  nor longer dare in a blind fight engage;
  contented now to gall them from below
  with darts and slings, and with the distant bow.

  elsewhere mezentius, terrible to view,
  a blazing pine within the trenches threw.
  but brave messapus, neptune's warlike son,
  broke down the palisades, the trenches won,
  and loud for ladders calls, to scale the town.

  then brave messapus ericetes slew,
  who from lycaon's blood his lineage drew.
  but from his headstrong horse his fate he found,
  who threw his master, as he made a bound:
  the chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground;
  then clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails:
  the trojan sinks, and neptune's son prevails.
  agis the lycian, stepping forth with pride,
  to single fight the boldest foe defied;
  whom tuscan valerus by force o'ercame,
  and not belied his mighty father's fame.
  salius to death the great antronius sent:
  but the same fate the victor underwent,
  slain by nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw
