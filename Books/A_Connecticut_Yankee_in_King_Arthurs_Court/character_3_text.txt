or any other common matter--

‚Äúyou know about transmigration of souls; do you know about
transposition of epochs--and bodies?‚Äù

i said i had not heard of it.  he was so little interested--just
as when people speak of the weather--that he did not notice
whether i made him any answer or not. there was half a moment
of silence, immediately interrupted by the droning voice of the
salaried cicerone:

done with a bullet since invention of firearms--perhaps maliciously
by cromwell‚Äôs soldiers.‚Äù

my acquaintance smiled--not a modern smile, but one that must
have gone out of general use many, many centuries ago--and muttered
apparently to himself:

   sent you thither to be her prisoners.  on the morn
   sir launcelot arose early, and left sir kay
   sleeping; and sir launcelot took sir kay‚Äôs armor
   and his shield and armed him, and so he went to

stranger came in.  i gave him a pipe and a chair, and made him
welcome.  i also comforted him with a hot scotch whisky; gave him
another one; then still another--hoping always for his story.

the frowning arches; and we, following, soon found ourselves in
a great paved court, with towers and turrets stretching up into
the blue air on all the four sides; and all about us the dismount
was going on, and much greeting and ceremony, and running to and
fro, and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors, and
an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion.



chapter ii

king arthur‚Äôs court

the moment i got a chance i slipped aside privately and touched
an ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said, in an
insinuating, confidential way:

‚Äúfriend, do me a kindness.  do you belong to the asylum, or are
you just on a visit or something like that?‚Äù

he looked me over stupidly, and said:

‚Äúmarry, fair sir, me seemeth--‚Äù

‚Äúthat will do,‚Äù i said; ‚Äúi reckon you are a patient.‚Äù

i moved away, cogitating, and at the same time keeping an eye
out for any cha

friendless; be honest and honorable with me.  are you in your

he said he was.

‚Äúare these other people in their right minds?‚Äù

he said they were.

‚Äúand this isn‚Äôt an asylum?  i mean, it isn‚Äôt a place where they
cure crazy people?‚Äù

he said it wasn‚Äôt.

‚Äúwell, then,‚Äù i said, ‚Äúeither i am a lunatic, or something just
as awful has happened.  now tell me, honest and true, where am i?‚Äù

‚Äúin king arthur‚Äôs court.‚Äù

i waited a minute, to let that idea shudder its way home,
and then said:

‚Äúand according to your notions, what year is it now?‚Äù

‚Äú528--nineteenth of june.‚Äù

i felt a mournful sinking at the heart, and muttered: ‚Äúi shall
never see my friends again--never, never again.  they will not
be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet.‚Äù

in the due course of custom i would be flung into a dungeon and
left there on scant commons until my friends ransomed me--unless
i chanced to rot, first.  i saw that the last chance had the best
show, but i didn‚Äôt waste any bother about that; time was too
precious.  the page said, further, that dinner was about ended
in the great hall by this time, and that as soon as the sociability
and the heavy drinking should begin, sir kay would have me in and
exhibit me before king arthur and his illustrious knights seated at
the table round, and would brag about his exploit in capturing
me, and would probably exaggerate the facts a little, but it
wouldn‚Äôt be good form for me to correct him, and not over safe,
either; and when i was done being exhibited, then ho for the
dungeon; but he, clarence, would find a way to come and see me every
now and then, and cheer me up, and help me get word to my friends.

get word to my friends!  i thanked him; i couldn‚Äôt do less; and

earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable
in english history--or in european history, for that matter--may be
said to have made their appearance.  suppose sir walter, instead
of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters,
had allowed the characters to speak for themselves?  we should
have had talk from rebecca and ivanhoe and the soft lady rowena
which would embarrass a tramp in our day.  however, to the
unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate.  king arthur‚Äôs
people were not aware that they were indecent and i had presence
of mind enough not to mention it.

they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were
mightily relieved, at last, when old merlin swept the difficulty
away for them with a common-sense hint.  he asked them why they
were so dull--why didn‚Äôt it occur to them to strip me.  in half a
minute i was as naked as a pair of tongs!  and dear, dear, to think
of it: i was the only embarrassed person there.  everybody discuss

excitement, and asked him what day of the month it was.

hang him, he said it was the _twenty-first_!  it made me turn cold
to hear him.  i begged him not to make any mistake about it; but
he was sure; he knew it was the 21st.  so, that feather-headed
boy had botched things again!  the time of the day was right
for the eclipse; i had seen that for myself, in the beginning,
by the dial that was near by.  yes, i was in king arthur‚Äôs court,
and i might as well make the most out of it i could.

the darkness was steadily growing, the people becoming more and
more distressed.  i now said:

‚Äúi have reflected, sir king.  for a lesson, i will let this darkness
proceed, and spread night in the world; but whether i blot out
the sun for good, or restore it, shall rest with you.  these are
the terms, to wit: you shall remain king over all your dominions,
and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship;

never find it out for yourself, and don‚Äôt believe it when somebody
else tells you.  it is enough to make a body ashamed of his race
to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones
without shadow of right or reason, and the seventh-rate people
that have always figured as its aristocracies--a company of monarchs
and nobles who, as a rule, would have achieved only poverty and
obscurity if left, like their betters, to their own exertions.

the most of king arthur‚Äôs british nation were slaves, pure and
simple, and bore that name, and wore the iron collar on their
necks; and the rest were slaves in fact, but without the name;
they imagined themselves men and freemen, and called themselves
so.  the truth was, the nation as a body was in the world for one
object, and one only: to grovel before king and church and noble;
to slave for them, sweat blood for them, starve that they might
be fed, work that they might play, drink misery to the dregs that

of course that taint, that reverence for rank and title, had been
in our american blood, too--i know that; but when i left america
it had disappeared--at least to all intents and purposes.  the
remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses.  when
a disease has worked its way down to that level, it may fairly
be said to be out of the system.

but to return to my anomalous position in king arthur‚Äôs kingdom.
here i was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master
intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement
the one and only actually great man in that whole british world;
and yet there and then, just as in the remote england of my
birth-time, the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descent
from a king‚Äôs leman, acquired at second-hand from the slums of
london, was a better man than i was.  such a personage was fawned
upon in arthur‚Äôs realm and rever

  galahault the noble prince cried on high, knight with
  the many colors, well hast thou justed; now make thee
  ready that i may just with thee.  sir gareth heard him,
  and he gat a great spear, and so they encountered
  together, and there the prince brake his spear; but sir
  gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm, that
  he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not
  his men recovered him.  truly, said king arthur, that
  knight with the many colors is a good knight.  wherefore
  the king called unto him sir launcelot, and prayed him
  to encounter with that knight.  sir, said launcelot, i
  may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at
  this time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and
  when a good knight doth so well upon some day, it is
  no good knight‚Äôs part to let him of his worship, and,
  namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great
  labour; for peradventure, said sir launcel

 he wanted plenty of air; and
he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap
factory anyway, and said if a man was to start one in his house
he would be damned if he wouldn‚Äôt strangle him.  there were ladies
present, too, but much these people ever cared for that; they would
swear before children, if the wind was their way when the factory
was going.

this missionary knight‚Äôs name was la cote male taile, and he said
that this castle was the abode of morgan le fay, sister of
king arthur, and wife of king uriens, monarch of a realm about
as big as the district of columbia--you could stand in the middle
of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom.  ‚Äúkings‚Äù and ‚Äúkingdoms‚Äù
 were as thick in britain as they had been in little palestine in
joshua‚Äôs time, when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up
because they couldn‚Äôt stretch out without a passport.

failure of his campaign.  he had not worked off a c

and what a glance she had: when it fell in reproof upon those
servants, they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the
lightning flashes out of a cloud.  i could have got the habit
myself.  it was the same with that poor old brer uriens; he was
always on the ragged edge of apprehension; she could not even turn
toward him but he winced.

in the midst of the talk i let drop a complimentary word about
king arthur, forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her
brother.  that one little compliment was enough.  she clouded up
like storm; she called for her guards, and said:

‚Äúhale me these varlets to the dungeons.‚Äù

that struck cold on my ears, for her dungeons had a reputation.
nothing occurred to me to say--or do.  but not so with sandy.
as the guard laid a hand upon me, she piped up with the tranquilest
confidence, and said:

i could not let this horror go on; it would have killed me to
see it.  i asked the queen to let me clear the place and speak
to the prisoner privately; and when she was going to object i spoke
in a low voice and said i did not want to make a scene before
her servants, but i must have my way; for i was king arthur‚Äôs
representative, and was speaking in his name.  she saw she had
to yield.  i asked her to indorse me to these people, and then
leave me.  it was not pleasant for her, but she took the pill;
and even went further than i was meaning to require.  i only wanted
the backing of her own authority; but she said:

‚Äúye will do in all things as this lord shall command.  it is the boss.‚Äù

sir marhaus said to the duke, cease thy sons, or else i will do
the uttermost to you all.  when the duke saw he might not escape
the death, he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them
to sir marhaus.  and they kneeled all down and put the pommels
of their swords to the knight, and so he received them.  and then
they holp up their father, and so by their common assent promised
unto sir marhaus never to be foes unto king arthur, and thereupon
at whitsuntide after, to come he and his sons, and put them in
the king‚Äôs grace.*

was; whether high or low, the bulk of its ability was in the long
ranks of its nameless and its poor, and so it never saw the day
that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself.
which is to assert an always self-proven fact: that even the best
governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still
behind the best condition attainable by its people; and that the
same is true of kindred governments of lower grades, all the way
down to the lowest.

king arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond
my calculations.  i had not supposed he would move in the matter
while i was away; and so i had not mapped out a scheme for determining
the merits of officers; i had only remarked that it would be wise
to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination;
and privately i meant to put together a list of military qualifications
that nobody could answer to but my west pointers.  that ought
to have been attended to before i left; for the

than other nines.  the umpire‚Äôs first decision was usually his
last; they broke him in two with a bat, and his friends toted him
home on a shutter.  when it was noticed that no umpire ever survived

protect him.
