  c  rations,  and  two  or  three
canteens  of  water.  together,  these  items  weighed  between  15  and  20
pounds,  depending  upon  a  man's  habits  or  rate  of  metabolism.  henry
dobbins,  who  was  a  big  man,  carried  extra  rations;  he  was  especially
fond  of  canned  peaches  in  heavy  syrup  over  pound  cake.  dave  jensen,
who  practiced  field  hygiene,  carried  a  toothbrush,  dental  floss,  and
several hotel-sized bars of soap he'd stolen on r&r in sydney, australia.
ted lavender, who was scared, carried tranquilizers until he was shot in
the head outside the village of than khe in mid-april. by necessity, and
because it was sop, they all carried steel helmets that weighed 5 pounds
including  the  liner  and  camouflage  cover.  they  carried  the  standard
fatigue  jackets  and  trousers.  very  few  carried  underwear.  on  their  feet
they  carried  jungle  boots—2.1  pounds—and  dave  jensen  carried  three
pairs  of  socks  and  a  can  of  dr.  scholl's  foot

from the dead.

head on his way back from peeing. he lay with his mouth open. the teeth
were broken. there was a swollen black bruise under his left eye.

the cheekbone was gone. oh shit, rat kiley said, the guy's dead. the
guy's  dead,  he  kept  saying,  which  seemed  profound—the  guy's  dead.  i
mean really.


the  things  they  carried  were  determined  to  some  extent  by
superstition. lieutenant cross carried his good-luck pebble. dave jensen

 the earth.

he felt shame. he hated himself. he had loved martha more than his
men,  and  as  a  consequence  lavender  was  now  dead,  and  this  was
something he would have to carry like a stone in his stomach for the rest
of the war.

all  he  could  do  was  dig.  he  used  his  entrenching  tool  like  an  ax,
slashing, feeling both love and hate, and then later, when it was full dark,
he sat at the bottom of his foxhole and wept. it went on for a long while.
in part, he was grieving for ted lavender, but mostly it was for martha,
and for himself, because she belonged to another world, which was not
quite  real,  and  because  she  was  a  junior  at  mount  sebastian  college  in
new jersey, a poet and a virgin and uninvolved, and because he realized
she did not love him and never would.




like  cement,  kiowa  whispered  in  the  dark.  i  swear  to  god—boom,

down. not a word.

i've heard this, said norman bowker.
a pisser, you know? still zipping himself up. zapped while zipping.

iowa  sinking  into  the  deep
muck of a shit field, or curt lemon hanging in pieces from a tree, and as
i  write  about  these  things,  the  remembering  is  turned  into  a  kind  of
rehappening.  kiowa  yells  at  me.  curt  lemon  steps  from  the  shade  into
bright sunlight, his face brown and shining, and then he soars into a tree.
the  bad  stuff  never  stops  happening:  it  lives  in  its  own  dimension,
replaying itself over and over.

but the war wasn't all that way.



like when ted lavender went too heavy on the tranquilizers. "how's
the  war  today?"  somebody  would  say,  and  ted  lavender  would  give  a
soft, spacey smile and say, "mellow, man. we got ourselves a nice mellow
war today."


and like the time we enlisted an old poppa-san to guide us through the
mine  fields  out  on  the  batangan  peninsula.  the  old  guy  walked  with  a
limp, slow and stooped over, but he knew where the safe spots were and
where you had to be careful and where even if you were careful you c

or  kiowa  teaching  a  rain  dance  to  rat  kiley  and  dave  jensen,  the
three  of  them  whooping  and  leaping  around  barefoot  while  a  bunch  of
villagers  looked  on  with  a  mixture  of  fascination  and  giggly  horror.
afterward, rat said, "so where's the rain?" and kiowa said, "the earth is
slow,  but  the  buffalo  is  patient,"  and  rat  thought  about  it  and  said,
"yeah, but where's the rain?"


or ted lavender adopting an orphan puppy—feeding it from a plastic
spoon and carrying it in his rucksack until the day azar strapped it to a
claymore antipersonnel mine and squeezed the firing device.


the average age in our platoon, i'd guess, was nineteen or twenty, and
as  a  consequence  things  often  took  on  a  curiously  playful  atmosphere,
like a sporting event at some exotic reform school. the competition could
be lethal, yet there was a childlike exuberance to it all, lots of pranks and

 nobody to
talk  to,  nothing  to  do  but  stare  into  the  big  black  hole  at  the  center  of
your own sorry soul. the hours go by and you lose your gyroscope; your
mind starts to roam. you think about dark closets, madmen, murderers
under the bed, all those childhood fears. gremlins and trolls and giants.
you try to block it out but you can't. you see ghosts. you blink and shake
your  head.  bullshit,  you  tell  yourself.  but  then  you  remember  the  guys
who died: curt lemon, kiowa, ted lavender, a half-dozen others whose
faces you can't bring into focus anymore. and then pretty soon you start
to ponder the stories you've heard about charlie's magic. the time some
guys cornered two vc in a dead-end tunnel, no way out, but how, when
the tunnel was fragged and searched, nothing was found except a pile of
dead rats. a hundred stories. ghosts wiping out a whole marine platoon
in twenty seconds flat. ghosts rising from the dead. ghosts behind you
and in front of you and inside you. after a

mitchell sanders nodded. he didn't know what to say. for a time they

sat watching the shadows come, then rat shook his head.

he said he'd done his best. he'd tried to be a decent medic. win some
and lose some, he said, but he'd tried hard. briefly then, rambling a little,
he talked about a few of the guys who were gone now, curt lemon and
kiowa and ted lavender, and how crazy it was that people who were so
incredibly alive could get so incredibly dead.

then he almost laughed.
"this whole war," he said. "you know what it is? just one big banquet.

meat, man. you and me. everybody. meat for the bugs."

the next morning he shot himself.
he took off his boots and socks, laid out his medical kit, doped himself

up, and put a round through his foot.
nobody blamed him, sanders said.

the lives of the dead


but this too is true: stories can save us. i'm forty-three years old, and a
writer now, and even still, right here, i keep dreaming linda alive. and
ted lavender, too, and kiowa, and curt lemon, and a slim young man i
killed,  and  an  old  man  sprawled  beside  a  pigpen,  and  several  others
whose bodies i once lifted and dumped into a truck. they're all dead. but
in a story, which is a kind of dreaming, the dead sometimes smile and sit
up and return to the world.

start  here:  a  body  without  a  name.  on  an  afternoon  in  1969  the
platoon took sniper fire from a filthy little village along the south china
sea.  it  lasted  only  a  minute  o

 there is
the  illusion  of  aliveness.  in  vietnam,  for  instance,  ted  lavender  had  a
habit of popping four or five tranquilizers every morning. it was his way



of  coping,  just  dealing  with  the  realities,  and  the  drugs  helped  to  ease
him through the days. i remember how peaceful his eyes were. even in
bad  situations  he  had  a  soft,  dreamy  expression  on  his  face,  which  was
what  he  wanted,  a  kind  of  escape.  "how's  the  war  today?"  somebody
would ask, and ted lavender would give a little smile to the sky and say,
"mellow—a nice smooth war today." and then in april he was shot in the
head outside the village of than khe. kiowa and i and a couple of others
were ordered to prepare his body for the dustoff. i remember squatting
down,  not  wanting  to  look  but  then  looking.  lavender's  left  cheekbone
was gone. there was a swollen blackness around his eye. quickly, trying
not  to  feel  anything,  we  went  through  the  kid's  pockets.  i  remember

ody,  but  rather  one  small  bit  of  waste  in  the  midst  of  a  much
wider wastage. i learned that words make a difference. it's easier to cope
with  a  kicked  bucket  than  a  corpse;  if  it  isn't  human,  it  doesn't  matter
much  if  it's  dead.  and  so  a  vc  nurse,  fried  by  napalm,  was  a  crispy
critter. a vietnamese baby, which lay nearby, was a roasted peanut. "just
a crunchie munchie," rat kiley said as he stepped over the body.

we kept the dead alive with stories. when ted lavender was shot in
the  head,  the  men  talked  about  how  they'd  never  seen  him  so  mellow,
how  tranquil  he  was,  how  it  wasn't  the  bullet  but  the  tranquilizers  that
blew  his  mind.  he  wasn't  dead,  just  laid-back.  there  were  christians
among us, like kiowa, who believed in the new testament stories of life
after death. other stories were passed down like legends from old-timer
to  newcomer.  mostly,  though,  we  had  to  make  up  our  own.  often  they
were exaggerated, or

looked back at the casket,
i felt dizzy again. in my heart, i'm sure, i knew this was linda, but even
so i couldn't find much to recognize. i tried to pretend she was taking a
nap, her hands folded at her stomach, just sleeping away the afternoon.
except  she  didn't  look  asleep.  she  looked  dead.  she  looked  heavy  and
totally dead.



i remember closing my eyes. after a while my father stepped up beside

me.

"come on now," he said. "let's go get some ice cream."



in the months after ted lavender died, there were many other bodies.
i  never  shook  hands—not  that—but  one  afternoon  i  climbed  a  tree  and
threw  down  what  was  left  of  curt  lemon.  i  watched  my  friend  kiowa
sink  into  the  muck  along  the  song  tra  bong.  and  in  early  july,  after  a
battle in the mountains, i was assigned to a six-man detail to police up
the enemy kias. there were twenty-seven bodies altogether, and parts of
several  others.  the  dead  were  everywhere.  some  lay  in  piles.  s
