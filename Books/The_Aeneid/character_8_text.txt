  are these our scepters? these our due rewards?
  and is it thus that jove his plighted faith regards?"

  to whom the father of th' immortal race,
  smiling with that serene indulgent face,
  with which he drives the clouds and clears the skies,
  first gave a holy kiss; then thus replies:

  "daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire
  the fates of thine are fix'd, and stand entire.
  thou shalt behold thy wish'd lavinian walls;
  and, ripe for heav'n, when fate aeneas calls,
  then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me:
  no councils have revers'd my firm decree.
  and, lest new fears disturb thy happy state,
  know, i have search'd the mystic rolls of fate:
  thy son (nor is th' appointed season far)
  in italy shall wage successful war,
  shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field,
  and sov'reign laws impose, and cities build,
  till, after ev'ry foe subdued, the sun

  these are th' italian names, which fate will join
  with ours, and graff upon the trojan line.
  observe the youth who first appears in sight,
  and holds the nearest station to the light,
  already seems to snuff the vital air,
  and leans just forward, on a shining spear:
  silvius is he, thy last-begotten race,
  but first in order sent, to fill thy place;
  an alban name, but mix'd with dardan blood,
  born in the covert of a shady wood:
  him fair lavinia, thy surviving wife,
  shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life.
  in alba he shall fix his royal seat,
  and, born a king, a race of kings beget.
  then procas, honor of the trojan name,
  capys, and numitor, of endless fame.
  a second silvius after these appears;
  silvius aeneas, for thy name he bears;
  for arms and justice equally renown'd,
  who, late restor'd, in alba shall be crown'd.
  how great they look! how vig'rously they wield
  their weighty lances, and sustain the shield!

  but this old peaceful prince, as heav'n decreed,
  was blest with no male issue to succeed:
  his sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;
  one only daughter heir'd the royal state.
  fir'd with her love, and with ambition led,
  the neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed.
  among the crowd, but far above the rest,
  young turnus to the beauteous maid address'd.
  turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,
  was first, and favor'd by the latian queen;
  with him she strove to join lavinia's hand,
  but dire portents the purpos'd match withstand.

  deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood
  a laurel's trunk, a venerable wood;
  where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair
  was kept and cut with superstitious care.
  this plant latinus, when his town he wall'd,
  then found, and from the tree laurentum call'd;
  and last, in honor of his new abode,
  he vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god.
  it happen'd once (a boding prodigy!)
  a swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky

,
  (unknown from whence they took their airy flight,)
  upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;
  there with their clasping feet together clung,
  and a long cluster from the laurel hung.
  an ancient augur prophesied from hence:
  "behold on latian shores a foreign prince!
  from the same parts of heav'n his navy stands,
  to the same parts on earth; his army lands;
  the town he conquers, and the tow'r commands."

  yet more, when fair lavinia fed the fire
  before the gods, and stood beside her sire,
  (strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke
  of incense, from the sacred altar broke,
  caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire;
  her crown and jewels crackled in the fire:
  from thence the fuming trail began to spread
  and lambent glories danc'd about her head.
  this new portent the seer with wonder views,
  then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:
  "the nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,
  shall shine with hono

ound his temples, deafs his ears:
  these he consults, the future fates to know,
  from pow'rs above, and from the fiends below.
  here, for the gods' advice, latinus flies,
  off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice:
  their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd,
  he laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd.
  no sooner were his eyes in slumber bound,
  when, from above, a more than mortal sound
  invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:
  "seek not, my seed, in latian bands to yoke
  our fair lavinia, nor the gods provoke.
  a foreign son upon thy shore descends,
  whose martial fame from pole to pole extends.
  his race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd,
  not latium shall contain, nor europe bound:
  't is theirs whate'er the sun surveys around."
  these answers, in the silent night receiv'd,
  the king himself divulg'd, the land believ'd:
  the fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew,
  when now the trojan navy was in view.

  beneath a shady tree, the hero spread
  his table on th

  thus while he spoke, latinus roll'd around
  his eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground.
  intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;
  not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,
  but pond'ring future things of wondrous weight;
  succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.
  on these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind,
  and then revolv'd what faunus had divin'd.
  this was the foreign prince, by fate decreed
  to share his scepter, and lavinia's bed;
  this was the race that sure portents foreshew
  to sway the world, and land and sea subdue.
  at length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke:
  "the pow'rs," said he, "the pow'rs we both invoke,
  to you, and yours, and mine, propitious be,
  and firm our purpose with their augury!
  have what you ask; your presents i receive;
  land, where and when you please, with ample leave;
  partake and use my kingdom as your own;
  all shall be yours, while i command the crown:
  and, if my wi

  betwixt her linen and her naked limbs;
  his baleful breath inspiring, as he glides,
  now like a chain around her neck he rides,
  now like a fillet to her head repairs,
  and with his circling volumes folds her hairs.
  at first the silent venom slid with ease,
  and seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees;
  then, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far,
  in plaintive accents she began the war,
  and thus bespoke her husband: "shall," she said,
  "a wand'ring prince enjoy lavinia's bed?
  if nature plead not in a parent's heart,
  pity my tears, and pity her desert.
  i know, my dearest lord, the time will come,
  you in vain, reverse your cruel doom;
  the faithless pirate soon will set to sea,
  and bear the royal virgin far away!
  a guest like him, a trojan guest before,
  in shew of friendship sought the spartan shore,
  and ravish'd helen from her husband bore.
  think on a king's inviolable word;
  and think on turnus, her once plighted lord:

  "arms! arms!" he cries: "my sword and shield prepare!"
  he breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war.
  so, when with crackling flames a caldron fries,
  the bubbling waters from the bottom rise:
  above the brims they force their fiery way;
  black vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day.

  the peace polluted thus, a chosen band
  he first commissions to the latian land,
  in threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest,
  to meet in arms th' intruding trojan guest,
  to force the foes from the lavinian shore,
  and italy's indanger'd peace restore.
  himself alone an equal match he boasts,
  to fight the phrygian and ausonian hosts.
  the gods invok'd, the rutuli prepare
  their arms, and warn each other to the war.
  his beauty these, and those his blooming age,
  the rest his house and his own fame ingage.

  while turnus urges thus his enterprise,
  the stygian fury to the trojans flies;
  new frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand,
  which overlooks the vale with wide command;
  where

  messapus next, (great neptune was his sire,)
  secure of steel, and fated from the fire,
  in pomp appears, and with his ardor warms
  a heartless train, unexercis'd in arms:
  the just faliscans he to battle brings,
  and those who live where lake ciminia springs;
  and where feronia's grove and temple stands,
  who till fescennian or flavinian lands.
  all these in order march, and marching sing
  the warlike actions of their sea-born king;
  like a long team of snowy swans on high,
  which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky,
  when, homeward from their wat'ry pastures borne,
  they sing, and asia's lakes their notes return.
  not one who heard their music from afar,
  would think these troops an army train'd to war,
  but flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar,
  with their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore.

  like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold.
  too late his blazing buckler they descry,
  and sparkling fires that shot from either eye,
  his mighty members, and his ample breast,
  his rattling armor, and his crimson crest.

  far from that hated face the trojans fly,
  all but the fool who sought his destiny.
  mad pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd
  for bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud:
  "these are not ardea's walls, nor this the town
  amata proffers with lavinia's crown:
  't is hostile earth you tread. of hope bereft,
  no means of safe return by flight are left."
  to whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate,
  thus turnus: "then begin, and try thy fate:
  my message to the ghost of priam bear;
  tell him a new achilles sent thee there."

  a lance of tough ground ash the trojan threw,
  rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:
  with his full force he whirl'd it first around;
  but the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound:

  while thus their factious minds with fury burn,
  the legates from th' aetolian prince return:
  sad news they bring, that, after all the cost
  and care employ'd, their embassy is lost;
  that diomedes refus'd his aid in war,
  unmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r.
  some new alliance must elsewhere be sought,
  or peace with troy on hard conditions bought.

  latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late,
  a foreign son is pointed out by fate;
  and, till aeneas shall lavinia wed,
  the wrath of heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head.
  the gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side,
  when late their titles in the field were tried:
  witness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears undried.
  thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all
  the latian senate to the council hall.
  the princes come, commanded by their head,
  and crowd the paths that to the palace lead.
  supreme in pow'r, and reverenc'd for his years,
  he takes the throne, and in the midst appears.

  a town in mourning, and a land in tears;
  while he, th' undoubted author of our harms,
  the man who menaces the gods with arms,
  yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight,
  and sought his safety in ignoble flight.
  now, best of kings, since you propose to send
  such bounteous presents to your trojan friend;
  add yet a greater at our joint request,
  one which he values more than all the rest:

  to whom the king sedately thus replied:
  "brave youth, the more your valor has been tried,
  the more becomes it us, with due respect,
  to weigh the chance of war, which you neglect.
  you want not wealth, or a successive throne,
  or cities which your arms have made your own:
  my towns and treasures are at your command,
  and stor'd with blooming beauties is my land;
  laurentum more than one lavinia sees,
  unmarried, fair, of noble families.
  now let me speak, and you with patience hear,
  things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear,
  but sound advice, proceeding from a heart
  sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.
  the gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,
  no prince italian born should heir my throne:

  and oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd.

  on your account i wag'd an impious war-
  with what success, 't is needless to declare;
  i and my subjects feel, and you have had your share.
  twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive,
  scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:

  to waive the combat, and pursue the war.
  whatever chance attends this fatal strife,
  think it includes, in thine, amata's life.
  i cannot live a slave, or see my throne
  usurp'd by strangers or a trojan son."

  at this, a flood of tears lavinia shed;
  a crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread,
  varying her cheeks by turns with white and red.
  the driving colors, never at a stay,
  run here and there, and flush, and fade away.

yal youth is slain.
  mad with her anguish, impotent to bear
  the mighty grief, she loathes the vital air.
  she calls herself the cause of all this ill,
  and owns the dire effects of her ungovern'd will;
  she raves against the gods; she beats her breast;
  she tears with both her hands her purple vest:
  then round a beam a running noose she tied,
  and, fasten'd by the neck, obscenely died.

  soon as the fatal news by fame was blown,
  and to her dames and to her daughter known,
  the sad lavinia rends her yellow hair
  and rosy cheeks; the rest her sorrow share:
  with shrieks the palace rings, and madness of despair.
  the spreading rumor fills the public place:
  confusion, fear, distraction, and disgrace,
  and silent shame, are seen in ev'ry face.
  latinus tears his garments as he goes,
  both for his public and his private woes;
  with filth his venerable beard besmears,
  and sordid dust deforms his silver hairs.
  and much he blames the softness of his mind,
  obnoxious to the
