e in
the universe.

the day that fayaway first wore this robe was rendered memorable by a
new acquaintance being introduced to me. in the afternoon i was lying
in the house when i heard a great uproar outside; but being by this time
pretty well accustomed to the wild halloos which were almost continually
ringing through the valley, i paid little attention to it, until old
marheyo, under the influence of some strange excitement, rushed into my
presence and communicated the astounding tidings, ‘marnoo pemi!’ which
being interpreted, implied that an individual by the name of marnoo was
approaching.

my worthy old friend evidently expected that this intelligence would
produce a great effect upon me, and for a time he stood earnestly
regarding me, as if curious to see how i should conduct myself, but as
i remained perfectly unmoved, the old gentleman darted out of the house
again, in as great a hurry as he had entered it.

‘marnoo, marnoo,’ cogitated i, ‘i have never heard that name bef

some distinguished character, i presume, from the prodigious riot the
natives are making;’ the tumultuous noise drawing nearer and nearer
every moment, while ‘marnoo!--marnoo!’ was shouted by every tongue.

i made up my mind that some savage warrior of consequence, who had
not yet enjoyed the honour of an audience, was desirous of paying his
respects on the present occasion. so vain had i become by the lavish
attention to which i had been accustomed, that i felt half inclined,
as a punishment for such neglect, to give this marnoo a cold reception,
when the excited throng came within view, convoying one of the most
striking specimens of humanity that i ever beheld.

limbs were beautifully formed; whilst the elegant outline of
his figure, together with his beardless cheeks, might have entitled him
to the distinction of standing for the statue of the polynesian apollo;
and indeed the oval of his countenance and the regularity of every
feature reminded one of an antique bust. but the marble repose of art
was supplied by a warmth and liveliness of expression only to be seen in
the south sea islander under the most favourable developments of nature.
the hair of marnoo was a rich curling brown, and twined about his
temples and neck in little close curling ringlets, which danced up and
down continually, when he was animated in conversation. his cheek was
of a feminine softness, and his face was free from the least blemish
of tattooing, although the rest of his body was drawn all over with
fanciful figures, which--unlike the unconnected sketching usual among
these natives--appeared to have been executed in conformity with some
general design.

filled the house. when i observed the striking devotion of the natives
to him, and their temporary withdrawal of all attention from myself, i
felt not a little piqued. the glory of tommo is departed, thought i, and
the sooner he removes from the valley the better. these were my feelings
at the moment, and they were prompted by that glorious principle
inherent in all heroic natures--the strong-rooted determination to have
the biggest share of the pudding or to go without any of it.

marnoo, that all-attractive personage, having satisfied his hunger and
inhaled a few whiffs from a pipe which was handed to him, launched
out into an harangue which completely enchained the attention of his
auditors.

little as i understood of the language, yet from his animated gestures
and the varying expression of his features--reflected as from so many
mirrors in the countenances around him, i could easily discover the
nature of those passions which he sought to arouse. from the frequent
recurrenc

 he appeared to be
rehearsing to his auditors events which had recently occurred in the
neighbouring bays. but how he had gained the knowledge of these matters
i could not understand, unless it were that he had just come from
nukuheva--a supposition which his travel-stained appearance not a little
supported. but, if a native of that region, i could not account for his
friendly reception at the hands of the typees.

never, certainly, had i beheld so powerful an exhibition of natural
eloquence as marnoo displayed during the course of his oration. the
grace of the attitudes into which he threw his flexible figure, the
striking gestures of his naked arms, and above all, the fire which shot
from his brilliant eyes, imparted an effect to the continually changing
accents of his voice, of which the most accomplished orator might have
been proud. at one moment reclining sideways upon the mat, and leaning
calmly upon his bended arm, he related circumstantially the aggressions
of the french--their host

 that as yet the terror of their name had preserved
them from attack, and with a scornful sneer he sketched in ironical
terms the wondrous intrepidity of the french, who, with five war-canoes
and hundreds of men, had not dared to assail the naked warriors of their
valley.

the effect he produced upon his audience was electric; one and all they
stood regarding him with sparkling eyes and trembling limbs, as though
they were listening to the inspired voice of a prophet.

but it soon appeared that marnoo’s powers were as versatile as they
were extraordinary. as soon as he had finished his vehement harangue, he
threw himself again upon the mats, and, singling out individuals in the
crowd, addressed them by name, in a sort of bantering style, the humour
of which, though nearly hidden from me filled the whole assembly with
uproarious delight.

he had a word for everybody; and, turning rapidly from one to another,
gave utterance to some hasty witticism, which was sure to be followed
by peals of l

aughter. to the females as well as to the men, he addressed
his discourse. heaven only knows what he said to them, but he caused
smiles and blushes to mantle their ingenuous faces. i am, indeed, very
much inclined to believe that marnoo, with his handsome person and
captivating manners, was a sad deceiver among the simple maidens of the
island.

during all this time he had never, for one moment, deigned to regard me.
he appeared, indeed, to be altogether unconscious of my presence. i
was utterly at a loss how to account for this extraordinary conduct. i
easily perceived that he was a man of no little consequence among the
islanders; that he possessed uncommon talents; and was gifted with a
higher degree of knowledge than the i

ptain of a trading vessel, with whom he
had stayed three years, living part of the time with him at sidney in
australia, and that at a subsequent visit to the island, the captain
had, at his own request, permitted him to remain among his countrymen.
the natural quickness of the savage had been wonderfully improved by his
intercourse with the white men, and his partial knowledge of a foreign
language gave him a great ascendancy over his less accomplished
countrymen.

when i asked the now affable marnoo why it was that he had not
previously spoken to me, he eagerly inquired what i had been led to
think of him from his conduct in that respect. i replied, that i had
supposed him to be some great chief or warrior, who had seen plenty
of white men before, and did not think it worth while to notice a poor
sailor. at this declaration of the exalted opinion i had formed of him,
he appeared vastly gratified, and gave me to understand that he had
purposely behaved in that manner, in order to increase m

as soon as he should see proper to address me.

marnoo now sought to learn my version of the story as to how i came
to be an inmate of the typee valley. when i related to him the
circumstances under which toby and i had entered it, he listened
with evident interest; but as soon as i alluded to the absence, yet
unaccounted for, of my comrade, he endeavoured to change the subject, as
if it were something he desired not to agitate. it seemed, indeed, as
if everything connected with toby was destined to beget distrust and
anxiety in my bosom. notwithst

anding marnoo’s denial of any knowledge
of his fate, i could not avoid suspecting that he was deceiving me; and
this suspicion revived those frightful apprehensions with regard to my
own fate, which, for a short time past, had subsided in my breast.

influenced by these feelings, i now felt a strong desire to avail myself
of the stranger’s protection, and under his safeguard to return to
nukuheva. but as soon as i hinted at this, he unhesitatingly pronounced
it to be entirely impracticable; assuring me t

my anxiety to escape from a captivity which, however endurable, nay,
delightful it might be in some respects, involved in its issues a fate
marked by the most frightful contingencies.

i could not conceal from my mind that toby had been treated in the same
friendly manner as i had been, and yet all their kindness terminated
with his mysterious disappearance. might not the same fate await me?--a
fate too dreadful to think of. stimulated by these considerations,
i urged anew my request to marnoo; but he only set forth in stronger
colours the impossibility of my escape, and repeated his previous
declaration that the typees would never be brought to consent to my
departure.

when i endeavoured to learn from him the motives which prompted them to
hold me a prisoner, marnoo again presumed that mysterious tone which had
tormented me with apprehension when i had questioned him with regard to
the fate of my companion.

to intercede for me with the natives, and endeavour to procure their
consent to my leaving them. to this he appeared strongly averse; but,
yielding at last to my importunities, he addressed several of the
chiefs, who with the rest had been eyeing us intently during the whole
of our conversation. his petition, however, was at once met with the
most violent disapprobation, manifesting itself in angry glances and
gestures, and a perfect torrent of passionate words, directed to both
him and myself. marnoo, evidently repenting the step he had taken,
earnestly deprecated the resentment of the crowd, and, in a few moments
succeeded in pacifying to some extent the clamours which had broken out
as soon as his proposition had been understood.

with the most intense interest had i watched the reception his
intercession might receive; and a bitter pang shot through my heart
at the additional evidence, now furnished, of the unchangeable
determination of the islanders. marnoo told me with evident alarm in

e to meddle with their
concerns, as such procedure, if persisted in, would at once absolve
the typees from the restraints of the ‘taboo’, although so long as
he refrained from such conduct, it screened him effectually from the
consequences of the enmity they bore his tribe. at this moment, mehevi,
who was present, angrily interrupted him; and the words which he uttered
in a commanding tone, evidently meant that he must at once cease talking
to me and withdraw to the other part of the house. marnoo immediately
started up, hurriedly enjoining me not to address him again, and as i
valued my safety, to refrain from all further allusion to the subject of
my departure; and then, in compliance with the order of the determined
chief, but not before it had again been angrily repeated, he withdrew to
a distance.

i now perceived, with no small degree of apprehension, the same savage
expression in the countenances of the natives, which had startled me
during the scene at the ti. they glanced their

eyes suspiciously from
marnoo to me, as if distrusting the nature of an intercourse carried on,
as it was, in a language they could not understand, and they seemed to
harbour the belief that already we had concerted measures calculated to
elude their vigilance.

the lively countenances of these people are wonderfully indicative of
the emotions of the soul, and the imperfections of their oral language
are more than compensated for by the nervous eloquence of their looks
and gestures. i could plainly trace, in every varying e

their faces, all those passions which had been thus unexpectedly aroused
in their bosoms.

it required no reflection to convince me, from what was going on, that
the injunction of marnoo was not to be rashly slighted; and accordingly,
great as was the effort to suppress my feelings, i accosted mehevi in
a good-humoured tone, with a view of dissipating any ill impression
he might have received. but the ireful, angry chief was not so easily
mollified. he rejected my advances with that peculiarly stern expression
i have before described, and took care by the whole of his behaviour
towards me to show the displeasure and resentment which he felt.

ravely to depart. no one expressed any regret at this movement,
so seizing his roll of tappa, and grasping his spear, he advanced to
the front of the pi-pi, and waving his hand in adieu to the now silent
throng, cast upon me a glance of mingled pity and reproach, and flung
himself into the path which led from the house. i watched his receding
figure until it was lost in the obscurity of the grove, and then gave
myself up to the most desponding reflections.

reflections after marnoo’s departure-battle of the pop-guns--strange
conceit of marheyo--process of making tappa

the knowledge i had now obtained as to the intention of the savages
deeply affected me.

marnoo, i perceived, was a man who, by reason of his superior
acquirements, and the knowledge he possessed of the events which were
taking place in the different bays of the island, was held in no little
estimation by the inhabitants of the valley. he had been received with
the most cordial welcome and respect. the na

their confidence revived, they might in a short time remit in some
degree their watchfulness over my movements, and i should then be the
better enabled to avail myself of any opportunity which presented itself
for escape. i determined, therefore, to make the best of a bad
bargain, and to bear up manfully against whatever might betide. in this
endeavour, i succeeded beyond my own expectations. at the period
of marnoo’s visit, i had been in the valley, as nearly as i could
conjecture, some two months. although not completely recovered from my
strange illness, which still lingered about me, i was free from pain
and able to take exercise. in short, i had every reason to anticipate a
perfect recovery. freed from apprehension on this point, and resolved
to regard the future without flinching, i flung myself anew into all the
social pleasures of the valley, and sought to bury all regrets, and
all remembrances o

s tahitians are the only people who at all deserve
to be compared with them; while the dark-haired hawaiians and
the woolly-headed feejees are immeasurably inferior to them. the
distinguishing characteristic of the marquesan islanders, and that
which at once strikes you, is the european cast of their features--a
peculiarity seldom observable among other uncivilized people. many of
their faces present profiles classically beautiful, and in the valley of
typee i saw several who, like the stranger marnoo, were in every respect
models of beauty.

original, i found in a small volume entitled ‘circumnavigation of the

to contain a very correct english version of great part of the learned

what could not now be
remedied, took no further notice of the occurrence, and i immediately
left the ti.

all that night i lay awake, revolving in my mind the fearful situation
in which i was placed. the last horrid revelation had now been made, and
the full sense of my condition rushed upon my mind with a force i had
never before experienced.

where, thought i, desponding, is there the slightest prospect of escape?
the only person who seemed to possess the ability to assist me was the
stranger marnoo; but would he ever return to the valley? and if he did,
should i be permitted to hold any communication with him? it seemed as
if i were cut off from every source of hope, and that nothing remained
but passively to await whatever fate was in store for me. a thousand
times i endeavoured to account for the mysterious conduct of the
natives.

for what conceivable purpose did they thus retain me a captive? what
could be their object in treating me with such apparent kindness, and
did it not cover s

to the bay, and if they should permanently locate any of their troops
in the valley, the savages could not for any length of time conceal my
existence from them. but what reason had i to suppose that i should be
spared until such an event occurred, an event which might be postponed
by a hundred different contingencies?



chapter thirty-three

the stranger again arrives in the valley--singular interview with
him--attempt to escape--failure--melancholy situation--sympathy of
marheyo

‘marnoo, marnoo pemi!’ such were the welcome sounds which fell upon my
ear some ten days after the events related in the preceding chapter.
once more the approach of the stranger was heralded, and the
intelligence operated upon me like magic. again i should be able to
converse with him in my own language; and i resolve at all hazards to
concert with him some scheme, however desperate, to rescue me from a
condition that had now become insupportable.

as he drew near, i remembered with many misgivings

too. no you see he no want you to speak at
all?--you see--ah! by by you no mind--you get well, he kill you, eat
you, hang you head up there, like happar kanaka.--now you listen--but no
talk any more. by by i go;--you see way i go--ah! then some night kanaka
all moee-moee (sleep)--you run away, you come pueearka. i speak pueearka
kanaka--he no harm you--ah! then i take you my canoe nukuheva--and you
run away ship no more.’ with these words, enforced by a vehemence of
gesture i cannot describe, marnoo started from my side, and immediately
engaged in conversation with some of the chiefs who had entered the
house.

it would have been idle for me to have attempted resuming the interview
so peremptorily terminated by marnoo, who was evidently little disposed
to compromise his own safety by any rash endeavour to ensure mine.
but the plan he had suggested struck me as one which might possibly be
accomplished, and i resolved to act upon it as speedily as possible.

accordingly, when he arose to dep

 issue from the house, and pretend that my object was
merely to procure a drink from the calabash, which always stood
without the dwelling on the corner of the pi-pi. on re-entering i would
purposely omit closing the passage after me, and trusting that the
indolence of the savages would prevent them from repairing my neglect,
would return to my mat, and waiting patiently until all were again
asleep, i would then steal forth, and at once take the route to
pueearka.

the very night which followed marnoo’s departure, i proceeded to put
this project into execution. about midnight, as i imagined, i arose and
drew the slide. the natives, just as i had expected, started up, while
some of them asked, ‘arware poo awa, tommo?’ (where are you going,
tommo?) ‘wai’ (water) i laconically answered, grasping the calabash. on
hearing my reply they sank back again, and in a minute or two i returned
to my mat, anxiously awaiting the result of the experiment.

one after another the savages, turning re
 
 ___________________________
 
gn on my part, or else prompted
by a desire to please me, regularly every evening placed a calabash of
water by my side.

even, under these inauspicious circumstances i again and again renewed
the attempt, but when i did so, my valet always rose with me, as if
determined i should not remove myself from his observation. for
the present, therefore, i was obliged to abandon the attempt; but i
endeavoured to console myself with the idea that by this mode i might
yet effect my escape.

shortly after marnoo’s visit i was reduced to such a state that it was
with extreme difficulty i could walk, even with the assistance of a
spear, and kory-kory, as formerly, was obliged to carry me daily to the
stream.

for hours and hours during the warmest part of the day i lay upon my
mat, and while those around me were nearly all dozing away in careless
ease, i remained awake, gloomily pondering over the fate which it
appeared now idle for me to resist, when i thought of the loved friends
who were thousands a

selves into our affections, especially in the hour of
affliction. even now, amidst all the bustle and stir of the proud and
busy city in which i am dwelling, the image of those three trees seems
to come as vividly before my eyes as if they were actually present, and
i still feel the soothing quiet pleasure which i then had in watching
hour after hour their topmost boughs waving gracefully in the breeze.



chapter thirty-four

the escape

nearly three weeks had elapsed since the second visit of marnoo, and it
must have been more than four months since i entered the valley, when
one day about noon, and whilst everything was in profound silence,
mow-mow, the one-eyed chief, suddenly appeared at the door, and leaning
towards me as i lay directly facing him, said in a low tone, ‘toby pemi
ena’ (toby has arrived here). gracious heaven! what a tumult of emotions
rushed upon me at this startling intelligence! insensible to the pain
that had before distracted me, i leaped to my feet, and called

vessel, being in distress
for men in these remote seas, had put into nukuheva in order to recruit
his ship’s company; but not a single man was to be obtained; and the
barque was about to get under weigh, when she was boarded by karakoee,
who informed the disappointed englishman that an american sailor
was detained by the savages in the neighbouring bay of typee; and he
offered, if supplied with suitable articles of traffic, to undertake his
release. the kanaka had gained his intelligence from marnoo, to whom,
after all, i was indebted for my escape. the proposition was acceded to;
and karakoee, taking with him five tabooed natives of nukuheva, again
repaired aboard the barque, which in a few hours sailed to that part of
the island, and threw her main-top-sail aback right off the entrance
to the typee bay. the whale-boat, manned by the tabooed crew, pulled
towards the head of the inlet, while the ship lay ‘off and on’ awaiting
its return.

the events which ensued have already been detai
