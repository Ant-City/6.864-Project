nic-stricken because he knew he couldn't keep it up
and he knew he had to. he wanted to die if that would get him out of work. the ground
began to rise and fall beneath him and things took on a strange color and the man
standing right beside him seemed miles off floating in a fog. there was nothing real but
pain.
the whole afternoon was a mixture of stumbling on his knees in the dust and
fighting for breath and feeling his stomach inside him swell and jerk and draw up hard.
he tried to think of diane. he tried to think of what she looked like. he tried to find her
there in the desert so he would have something to tie to. but he couldn't bring her face
before his eyes. he couldn't even imagine her.
suddenly he thought oh diane you're not worth it. you can't be worth it. no one on
earth except maybe a guy's mother could be worth so much pain. yet working there in the
midst of pain he tried to figure out excuses for diane. maybe she really hadn't meant to
cheat on him. maybe she had dated glen

 hogan because she couldn't find any other way
out. if that was true and he hoped it was true then it was awfully silly for him to be away
out here in the desert forgetting it all with a bunch of mexicans when he might just as
well be back in the cool shade of shale city enjoying summer vacation and thinking
maybe i'll have a date with diane tonight.
he thought girls are a terrible thing all right. girls are probably all untrue and
faithless and they try to smash a guy but you've just got to expect it from them. you've
had to expect it from them and learn to forgive them because it stood to reason that if you
rushed away like he and howie had and went into the middle of a desert and decided you
would bury yourselves there for the whole three months' summer vacation why nobody
suffered but you. and that left the girl back there in s

even bother to unroll their bedding. they just flopped on the bunks
and lay there quiet and still. the foreman came up and asked if they wanted him to show
them where they could get dinner. but they didn't pay any attention to him. they just lay
back and closed their eyes.
he had reached a funny state. it was the first time in his life he had ever felt that way.
no one part of his body hurt more than any other part so the pain everywhere stopped and
he was only numb and sleepy. he thought about diane again. not for very long but she
was the last thought in his mind before the darkness. he thought about diane tiny and
cute and scared the first time he kissed her. oh diane he thought how could you have
done such a thing? how could you have done it? and then somebody was shaking him.
they might have been shaking him for hours for all he knew. he opened his eyes. he
was still in the bunkhouse. it was dark and the air was filled with sighs. there was a
smell of smoke in the place. the mexicans h

 the corners of it were all bloody where howie had
been holding it. it read dear howie why were you so impetuous stop i am miserable
thinking what you have done stop please forgive me and come right back to shale city
stop i hate glen hogan stop love onie.
even in the dimness of the bunkhouse he could see the happiness on howie's face.
so onie hated glen hogan did she? well he knew why and if howie didn't know why
then howie was a fool. onie hated glen hogan because glen had thrown her over for
diane. he thought about this for a little bit and about how much prettier diane was than
onie and about how the whole thing showed what good judgment glen hogan had. then
he saw that howie was waiting for an answer. when he tried to answer he found he could
only whisper.
"why do you have to wake a guy up who needs sleep as bad as i do just to show him
that?" "because i got it all figured out." "uh."
howie began to whisper very excitedly. "it's just like this. for fellows like you and
me to be out her

e slaving our best years away on a section gang is just
as if girls nice girls like onie and diane suddenly decided to become
washerwomen."
he didn't say anything. he just lay there and thought about it. he could see the point
all right. the idea of diane being a washerwoman was so awful he just closed his eyes
again. howie was whispering at him.
"of course since onie feels that way i hardly know what to do about the poor kid."
he just lay there with his eyes closed saying nothing.
"it isn't as if i didn't have a reason to go back. it's almost as if it was my duty to."
he just lay there limp. but he was listening to howie very closely.
"the dispatcher says there's a gravel train going through here tonight bound for
shale city."
still he didn't s

way riding into shale city he thought about bill harper. he thought to
himself only last night i hit bill harper. he thought to himself bill harper was my best
friend and he was telling me the truth and i hit him for it. he lay back against the gravel
and stared up at the stars. he thought how he and bill harper had sat in the drug store and
how bill harper had hemmed and hawed and how he had finally come to the point. he
remembered all over again the rage he felt when bill harper told him that diane was
going out that night with glen hogan. he knew it was probably true or bill harper
wouldn't have told him. yet he had stood up and he had called bill harper a liar and he
had hit bill harper and knocked him down and then he had walked out of the drug store
alone.
on the way home he had run into diane and glen hogan just getting out of glen's
roadster and going into the elysium theatre. then he knew that bill harper had been telling
him the truth. he knew that diane had been cheating on him.

d the first time either of them took a girl
out. they made it a foursome because they were so scared. he remembered the time
major his pup was run over and how bill came over that night with his old man's car and
took him riding out in the country until after midnight and didn't say a word all that time
because bill knew how he felt. he remembered lots of other times too and he thought bill
harper is too good a friend to lose over any girl. he thought bill is too good a friend to
lose even over diane and tomorrow i will tell him so. tomorrow i will go over to his
house and say bill let's forget about it. bill let's be friends because it won't ever happen
again.
and then as the gravel train got closer to shale city he thought back to diane again.
in the coolness of the night he could bring her face up before his mind. he hadn't been
able to do it out there on the desert. he could bring her face up before his mind and she
was smiling. he thought howie believed he had lost onie but he hadn't b

ecause onie
admitted she was wrong and asked him to come back. he thought besides i don't want
diane running around with glen hogan. anybody but glen hogan. just because glen
had a good looking car he seemed to think he could take liberties with a girl that the
ordinary guy would never think of. he felt scary whenever he thought of diane and glen
hogan together. he saw where it was more or less his duty to see diane and talk to her
like a brother and tell her about glen hogan. he knew that he had to save diane the embarrassment
of finding out for herself what kind of guy glen hogan was. he must do that
even at the expense of his pride.
they dropped off the gravel train just outside the station because they didn't want
anybody to see them they were such sights. they walked for two blocks and then howie
stopped.
"well i'll be leaving you here."
"where are you going?"
"thought i'd drop by onie's house."

en as if the desert and the section gang had
never existed at all. he was awfully tired but there was no one watching him to see that
he kept moving and he knew he could stop and rest whenever he wanted to and somehow
he had got his second wind so he didn't even notice the weight of his bed roll. he just
seemed to drift along there in the cool. it was a little after eleven o'clock.
and then he suddenly knew why he felt so good when all the time he should be
feeling bad. it was because he was on diane's street. he hadn't deliberately planned to be
there because it was a couple of blocks out of his way and he was really awfully tired. it
just seemed that something pulled him over to that street and he was glad for it. even on
ordinary nights he always had the funniest feeling when he got near diane's house. he
always got tight in his throat and half way excited and half way scared whenever he came
near to where she lived.
then all of a sudden he thought here you can't be passing diane's house

and dirty like you are now. you can't run the risk of letting her see you in this
condition. so he went across the street and started walking on his tip toes as if she might
be asleep and the very sound of his footsteps might wake her and frighten her. and all the
time something inside him was saying tomorrow you'll see her tomorrow you'll see her
tomorrow you'll see her.
then just across from her place he stopped still and quit breathing. diane was there
on the front steps with her arms around somebody and somebody's arms around her. they
were kissing. he didn't do anything. he just stood there a little behind a tree and watched.
he didn't want to watch and yet he wanted to watch more than anything else he could
think of. he felt ashamed watching and yet he couldn't move one inch from the spot. he
just stood there. he just stood there and watched.
pretty soon the guy she was kissing let her go and diane ran up the steps in that

little way she always had and turned just as she got to the door to smile. he
couldn't see her face of course but he knew she was smiling. a minute of that and then
whoever she had been kissing turned away and began coming down the walk. he was
whistling. he was whistling softly and kind of bouncing up and down as he walked away
from having kissed diane. when he got out from between the trees the starlight fell on
his face. it was bill harper.
still he stood there. bill harper walked on down the street and turned the corner. the
light in diane's living room went on and off. next the light in her bedroom came on. he
saw her shadow on the curtain twice as she crossed. then the light went off. he stood
there and thought goodbye diane goodbye.
then he started walking home.
every muscle in his body was sore. his hands and his stomach and his head t

and burned. the bed roll seemed to weigh a hundred pounds almost. but that wasn't what
hurt him. it was something inside of him kept saying you're no good. you're just no good.
people would ask why don't i see you and diane together any more? and there would
be nothing he could say. people would ask what's the matter with you and bill harper
that we don't see you around any more? and there would be nothing he could say. his dad
would ask how come you got a job on the section gang and stayed only one day? and
there would be nothing he could say.
it was all over. it was something he could never explain. something nobody would
understand. he had lost the only friend he might have told it to. because he knew that he

nd bill could never again be what they had been. they might shake hands and say forget
it old man and start bumming around together a little but it wouldn't be the same. and
both of them would know it. both of them would know that diane was there between
them. both of them would also know that diane probably didn't care but that wouldn't
make things any different for them. they'd never be able to explain it even to themselves.
but more than that he thought about diane. it seemed like dying to think he would
never see her again really and that he would never be close to her again and that they
would never laugh and kid each other again. it wasn't glen hogan who had done it. he
could have forgiven her for glen hogan. he could have forgiven her for that and tried to
make it all up. the awful thing was that she had done something he couldn't forgive her
for ever no matter how much he wanted to. and he did want to. he did want to awfully.
but he never could.

f tears and he was sick at heart. it took him a long time to go to sleep.
it all seemed so real at the time and now it wasn't real at all. that was a long time
ago. that was in shale city. that was before he came to los angeles. that was when he
was a kid in high school. it seemed so long ago. somewhere probably in colorado glen
hogan and howie were still kicking around. he had got a letter once saying bill harper
had been killed at belleau wood. bill harper was a lucky guy. bill harper had got diane
and then he had been killed.
oh christ he was all mixed up again. he didn't know where he was or what he was
doing. but he was cooling off. he wasn't burning up any more. he was just light headed
and confused and he couldn't figure things out. everything was a mess but at least he was
cool.

he couldn't get used to the way things were melting into each other. sometimes he was
drifting on top of white clouds frightened at his smallness in the midst of a thing so big as
the sky. sometime
