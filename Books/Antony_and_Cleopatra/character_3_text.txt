lord alexas, sweet alexas, most anything alexas, almost
most absolute alexas, where's the soothsayer that you praised so
to the queen? o that i knew this husband, which you say must
charge his horns with garlands!

alexas.
soothsayer,--

soothsayer.
your will?

charmian.
is this the man?--is't you, sir, that know things?

charmian.
then belike my children shall have no names:--pr'ythee, how many
boys and wenches must i have?

soothsayer.
if every of your wishes had a womb,
and fertile every wish, a million.

charmian.
out, fool! i forgive thee for a witch.

alexas.
you think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.

charmian.
nay, come, tell iras hers.

alexas.
we'll know all our fortunes.

enobarbus.
mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall be--

iras.
there's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.

charmian.
e'en as the o'erflowing nilus presageth famine.

iras.

charmian.
nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, i cannot
scratch mine ear.--pr'ythee, tell her but worky-day fortune.

soothsayer.
your fortunes are alike.

but how, but how? give me particulars.

iras.
amen. dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! for, as it is
a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose-wived, so it is a
deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear
isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!

charmian.
amen.

alexas.
lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would

there's a great spirit gone! thus did i desire it:
what our contempts doth often hurl from us,
we wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
by revolution lowering, does become
the opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
the hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.
i must from this enchanting queen break off:
ten thousand harms, more than the ills i know,
my idleness doth hatch--ho, enobarbus!

[re-enter enobarbus.]

enobarbus.
what's your pleasure, sir?

antony.
i must with haste from hence.

enobarbus.
why, then we kill all our women: we see how mortal an unkindness
is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the word.

antony.
i must be gone.

them away for nothing; though, between them and a great cause
they should be esteemed nothing. cleopatra, catching but the

she is cunning past man's thought.

enobarbus.
alack, sir, no: her passions are made of nothing but the finest
part of pure love: we cannot call her winds and waters, sighs and
tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can
report: this cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
shower of rain as well as jove.

antony.

not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.

enobarbus.
why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. when it pleaseth
their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to
man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that when old
robes are worn out there are members to make new. if there were
no more women but fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case
to be lamented: this grief is crown'd with consolation; your old
smock brings forth a new petticoat:--and, indeed, the tears live
in an onion that should water this sorrow.

abode.

antony.
no more light answers. let our officers
have notice what we purpose. i shall break
the cause of our expedience to the queen,
and get her leave to part. for not alone
the death of fulvia, with more urgent touches,
do strongly speak to us; but the letters too

you praise yourself
by laying defects of judgment to me; but
you patch'd up your excuses.

antony.
not so, not so;
i know you could not lack, i am certain on't,
very necessity of this thought, that i,
your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
which 'fronted mine own peace. as for my wife,
i would you had her spirit in such another:
the third o' theworld is yours; which with a snaffle
you may pace easy, but not such a wife.

enobarbus.
would we had all such wives, that the men
might go to wars with the women.

shrewdness of policy too,--i grieving grant

caesar.

to have me out of egypt, made wars here;
for which myself, the ignorant motive, do
so far ask pardon as befits mine honour
to stoop in such a case.

'tis noble spoken.

maecenas.
if it might please you to enforce no further
the griefs between ye: to forget them quite

speaks to atone you.

worthily spoken, maecenas.

enobarbus.
or, if you borrow one another's love for the instant, you may,
when you hear no more words of pompey, return it again: you shall
have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.

thou art a soldier only: speak no more.

enobarbus.
that truth should be silent i had almost forgot.

when she first met mark antony she pursed up his heart, upon the
river of cydnus.

agrippa.
there she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised well for her.

enobarbus.
i will tell you.
the barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
purple the sails, and so perfumed that
the winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
the water which they beat to follow faster,
as amorous of their strokes. for her own person,
it beggar'd all description: she did lie
in her pavilion,--cloth-of-gold of tissue,--
o'er-picturing that venus where we see
the fancy

stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling cupids,
with divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
and what they undid did.

agrippa.
o, rare for antony!

enobarbus.
her gentlewomen, like the nereids,
so many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
and made their bends adornings: at the helm
a seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
that yarely frame the office. from the barge
a strange invisible perfume hits the sense
of the adjacent wharfs. the city cast
her people out upon her; and antony,
enthron'd i' the market-place, did sit alone,
whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
had gone to gaze

it should be better he became her guest;
which she entreated: our courteous antony,

being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
and, for his ordinary, pays his heart
for what his eyes eat only.

age cannot wither her, nor custom stale

where most she satisfies: for vilest things
become themselves in her; that the holy priests
bless her when she is riggish.

yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a

you have said, sir. we look'd not for mark antony here: pray you,

true, sir; she was the wife of caius marcellus.

enobarbus.
but she is now the wife of marcus antonius.

menas.
pray you, sir?

'tis true.

menas.
then is caesar and he for ever knit together.

enobarbus.
if i were bound to divine of this unity, i would not prophesy so.

i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than
the love of the parties.
