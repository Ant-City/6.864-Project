hana bows her head, embarrassed. 
caravaggio walks around, looking at the building for the first time, peering down from the loggia into the garden. 
â€œyes, you used to love him. you used to drive us all mad with your new information about giuseppe. what a man! the best 

in every way, youâ€™d say. we all had to agree with you, the cocky sixteen-year-old.â€

need some chickens.â€ she is looking at caravaggio, knowing his skills from the past, not quite saying it. 

â€œi lost my nerve,â€ he says.

at night sometimes, when the english patient is asleep or even after she has read alone outside his door for a while, she goes

is able to hide well. but the girl watches him quizzically, tilting her head in a question as a dog would when spoken to in a tone

half a year earlier, from a window at the end of the long hall in santa chiara hospital in pisa, hana had been able to see a 
white lion. it stood alone on top of the battlements, linked by colour to the white marble of the duomo and the camposanto, 
though its roughness and naive form seemed part of another era. like some gift from the past that had to be accepted.

the villa san girolamo, built to protect inhabitants from the flesh of the devil, had the look of a besieged fortress, the limbs 
of  most  of  the  statues  blown  off  during  the  first  days  of  shelling.  there  seemed  little  demarcation  between  house  and 
landscape, between damaged building and the burned and shelled remnants of the earth. to hana the wild gardens were like 
further rooms. she worked along the edges of them aware always of unexploded mines. in one soil-rich area beside the house 
she began to garden with a furious passion that could come only to someone who had grown up in a city. in spite of the burned 
earth, in spite of the lack of water. someday there would be a bower of limes, rooms of green light.

caravaggio stood there. those who weep lose more energy than they lose during any other act. it was not yet dawn. her face 

against the darkness of the table wood. 

â€œhana,â€ he said, and she stilled herself as if she could be camouflaged by stillness. â€œhana.â€ 
she began to moan so the sound would be a barrier between them, a river across which she could not be reached. 
he was uncertain at first about touching her in her nakedness, said â€œhana,â€ and then lay his bandaged hand on her shoulder. 

she did not stop shaking. the deepest sorrow, he thought. where the only way to survive is to excavate everything. 

she raised herself, her head down still, then stood up against him as if dragging herself away from the magnet of the table.

is no trick, that what looks like a gill is where the thumb has been cut away. he moves the hand towards her blouse. 
she feels the cloth lift in the area below her shoulder as he holds it with two fingers and tugs it softly towards him.

the voice filled the halls. caravaggio walked into the kitchen, tore off a section of bread and followed hana up the stairs. 

as  he  walked  towards  the  room  the  shouts  became  more  frantic.  when  he  stepped  into  the  bedroom  the  englishman  was 
staring at a dogâ€”the dogâ€™s head angled back as if stunned by the screaming. hana

caravaggio, who was offering it the heel of bread. the englishman saw caravaggio then and his jaw dropped. it must have 
seemed to him that the dogâ€”now blocked by hanaâ€™s back â€”had turned into a man. caravaggio collected the dog in his arms 
and left the room.

this room with a bust of plato and argued all night. 

and then came savonarolaâ€™s cry out of the streets: â€œrepentance! the deluge is coming!â€ and everything was swept away 
â€”free will, the desire to be elegant, fame, the right to worship plato as well as christ. now came the bonfiresâ€”the burning of 
wigs, books, animal hides, maps. more than four hundred years later they opened up the graves. picoâ€™s bones were preserved. 
polizianoâ€™s had crumbled into dust. 

hana listened as the englishman turned the pages of his commonplace book and read the information glued in from other 
booksâ€”about great maps lost in the bonfires and the burning of platoâ€™s statue, whose marble exfoliated in the heat, the cracks 
across wisdom like precise reports across the valley as poliziano stood on the grass hills smelling the future. pico down there

opened his eyes and there was a giant head beside him. he breathed in and his chest filled with water. he was underwater. 
there was a bearded head beside him in the shallow water of the arno. he reached towards it but couldnâ€™t even nudge it. light 
was pouring into the river. he swam up to the surface, parts of which were on fire.

path and stepped into the library. 

he had approached the villa on that night of the storm not out of curiosity about the music but because of a danger to the

caravaggio enters the library. he has been spending most afternoons there. as always, books are mystical creatures to him. 

he plucks one out and opens it to the title page. he is in the room about five minutes before he hears a slight groan.

the two men take a trip by cart down into the valley to pick up a sack of flour. also, the soldier has to deliver maps of the 
cleared areas to headquarters at san domenico. finding it difficult to ask questions about each other, they speak about hana. 
there are many questions before the older man admits having known her before the war.

outside his room so he would turn up the volume and even hear its damn breathing, or the shout on the terrace from the sapper. 
the english patient within a few days of the young soldierâ€™s arrival had thus become aware of his presence around the house, 
though hana kept them separate, knowing they would probably not like each other. 

but she entered the englishmanâ€™s room one day to find the sapper there. he was standing at the foot of the bed, his arms 
hung  over  the  rifle  that  rested  across  his  shoulders.  she  disliked  this  casual  handling  of  the  gun,  his  lazy  spin  towards  her 
entrance as if his body were the axle of a wheel, as if the weapon had been sewn along his shoulders and arms and into his 
small brown wrists.

it meant having to listen to the patient talk in his circuitous way, and the young soldier was not used to remaining still and 
silent. he would get restless and kept interrupting the pauses and silences the englishman always allowed himself, trying to 
energize the train of thought. the soldier rolled his head back and looked at the ceiling. 

â€œwhat we should do is make a sling,â€ the sapper mused, turning to hana as she entered, â€œand carry him around the house.â€

articulate one,  who  had articulated fury  when they all left for the  war.  all through the  last  year in italy she has carried the 
letters from clara. letters she knows were written on a pink rock on an island in georgian bay, written with the wind coming 
over the  water and curling the paper of her notebook before she finally tore the pages  out and put them in an envelope for 
hana. she carried them in her suitcase, each containing a flake of pink rock and that wind. but she has never answered them. 
she has missed clara with a woe but is unable to write to her, now, after all that has happened to her. she cannot bear to talk of

the tales hana had read to the english patient, travelling with the old wanderer in kim or with fabrizio in the charterhouse 
of parma, had intoxicated them in a swirl of armies and horses and wagonsâ€”those running away from or running towards a 
war. stacked in one corner of his bedroom were other books she had read to him whose landscapes they have already walked 
through.

his book are all pre-war, the deserts of egypt and libya in the 19305, interspersed with references to cave art or gallery art or 
journal notes in his own small handwriting. â€œthere are no brunettes,â€ the english patient says to hana as she bends over him,

submerged within the crabbed handwriting in his thick-leaved sea-book of maps and texts. there is even a small fern glued 
into it. the histories. she doesnâ€™t close the book, hasnâ€™t touched it since she laid it on the side table. she walks away from it.

but painted all the characters black. kip was being pulled into a psychological vortex. with the knife he began to scrape the 
paint free, revealing a red, a blue, a green. would his opponent have also switched them? heâ€™d have to set up a detour with 
black wire of his own like an oxbow river and then test the loop for positive or negative power. then he would check it for 
fading power and know where the danger lay. 

 
hana was carrying a long mirror in front of her down the hall. she would pause because of the weight of it and then move 

forward, the mirror reflecting the old dark pink of the passageway. 

the  englishman  had  wanted  to  see  himself.  before  she  stepped  into  the  room  she  carefully  turned  the  reflection  upon 

herself, not wanting the light to bounce indirectly from the window onto his face.

pushed the sheets down with his hands. here, do this, pushing as far as he could, and hana flicked the sheet to the base of the

she stood on a chair at the foot of the bed and slowly tilted the  mirror down at him. she  was in this position, her hands 

braced out in front of her, when she heard the faint shouts. 

she ignored them at first. the house often picked up noise from the valley. the use of megaphones by the clearance military 

had constantly unnerved her when she was living alone with the english patient.

 she had made him

that could usefully influence what he chose to do with a mine. 

but he felt he was now within something, perhaps a painting he had seen somewhere in the last year. some secure couple in 
a field. how many he had seen with their laziness of sleep, with no thought of work or the dangers of the world. beside him 
there were the mouselike movements within hanaâ€™s breath; her eyebrows rode upon argument, a small fury in her dreaming. 
he turned his eyes away, up towards the tree and the sky of white cloud. her hand gripped him as mud had clung along the 
bank of the moro river, his fist plunging into the wet earth to stop himself slipping back into the already crossed torrent. 

if he were a hero in a painting, he could claim a just sleep. 
but as even she had said, he was the brownness of a rock, the brownness of a muddy storm-fed river. and somethi

she could hardly stand up, the dazzle of sun, her tired legs. how long they had been there she still didnâ€™t know. she could 

not forget the depth of her sleep, the lightness of the plummet. 

 
a party began in the english patientâ€™s room when caravaggio revealed the gramophone he had found somewhere. 
â€œi  will  use it to teach  you to dance, hana. not  what  your  young  friend there knows. i  have  seen and turned  my back on 
certain  dances.  but  this  tune,  â€˜how  long  has  this  been  going  on,â€™  is  one  of  the  great  songs  because  the  introductionâ€™s

patient to fill his empty glass, and touched the rim of his glass with the bottle in a toast. west wind coming into the room. and 
he turned suddenly, angry. a frail scent of cordite reaching him, a percentage of it in the air, and then he slipped out of the 
room, gesturing weariness, leaving hana in the arms of caravaggio. 

 
there was no light with him as he ran along the dark hall. he scooped up the satchel, was out of the house and racing down 

the thirty-six chapel steps to the road, just running, cancelling the thought of exhaustion from his body. 

was it a sapper or was it a civilian? the smell of flower and herb along the road wall, the beginning stitch at his side. an 
accident or wrong choice. the sappers kept to themselves for the most part. they were an odd group as far as

he turned away from mystery books with irritation, able to pinpoint villains  with too much ease. he was most comfortable 
with men who had the abstract madness of autodidacts, like his mentor, lord suffolk, like the english patient. 

he did not yet have a faith in books. in recent days, hana had watched him sitting beside the english patient, and it seemed 
to her a reversal of kim. the young student was now indian, the wise old teacher was english. but it was hana in the night 
who stayed with the old man, who guided him over the mountains to the sacred river. they had even read that book together, 
hanaâ€™s voice slow when wind flattened the candle flame beside her, the page dark for a moment.

and in some way on those long nights of reading and listening, she supposed, they had prepared themselves for the young

he was the officer creighton. 

a book, a map of knots, a fuze board, a room of four people in an abandoned villa lit only by candlelight and now and then

moment already. he was someone who felt uncomfortable in celebrations, in victories. 

just fifty yards away, there had been no representation of them in the world, no sound or sight of them from the valleyâ€™s eye 
as hanaâ€™s and caravaggioâ€™s shadows glided across the walls and kip sat comfortably encased in the alcove and the english 
patient sipped his wine and felt its spirit percolate through his unused body so it was quickly drunk, his voice bringing forth the 
whistle of a desert fox bringing forth a flutter of the english wood thrush he said was found only in essex, for it thrived in the 
vicinity of lavender and wormwood. all of the burned manâ€™s desire was in the brain, the sapper had been thinking t

he had walked back through the village, rain falling into pollarded trees of the town square untrimmed since the start of the 
war, past the strange statue of two men shaking hands on horseback. and now he was here, the candlelight swaying, altering 
her look so he could not tell what she thought. wisdom or sadness or curiosity. 

if she had been reading or if she had been bending over the englishman, he would have nodded to her and probably left, but 
he is now watching hana as someone young and alone. tonight, gazing at the scene of the mine blast, he had begun to fear her 
presence during the afternoon dismantling. he had to remove it, or she would be with him each time he approached a fuze. he 
would  be  pregnant  with  her.  when  he  worked,  clarity  and  music  filled  him,  the  human  world  extinguished.  now  she  was

want  comfort  but  he  wanted  to  surround  the  girl  with  it,  to  guide  her  from  this  room.  he  refused  to  believe  in  his  own

for her he was just a silhouette, his slight body and his skin part of the darkness. 

earlier, when she saw that he had left the window alcove, she had been enraged. knowing that he was protecting them like 
children from the mine. she had clung closer to caravag-gio. it had been an insult. and tonight the growing exhilaration of the

he puts his left hand on her shoulder.

caravaggio sits in hanaâ€™s chair. afternoon sun fills the room, revealing the swimming motes. the englishmanâ€™s dark lean 

face with its angular nose has the appearance of a still hawk swaddled in sheets. the coffin of a hawk, caravaggio thinks. 

the englishman turns to him. 
â€œthereâ€™s a painting by caravaggio, done late in his life. david with the head of goliath. in it, the young warrior holds at the 
end of his outstretched arm the head of goliath, ravaged and old. but that is not the true sadness in the pic

working in cairo during the early days of the war, he had been trained to invent double agents or phantoms who would take

let me tell you a story,â€ caravaggio says to hana. â€œthere was a hungarian named almasy, who worked for the germans 
during the war. he flew a bit with the afrika korps, but he was more valuable than that. in the 19305 he had been one of the 
great desert explorers. he knew every water hole and had helped map the sand sea. he knew all about the desert. he knew all 
about dialects. does this sound familiar? between the two wars he was always on expeditions out of cairo. one was to search 
for zerzuraâ€”the lost oasis. then when war broke out h

â€œcaravaggio thinks he knows who you are,â€ hana said.

â€œhe  says  you  are  not  english.  he  worked  with  intelligence  out  of  cairo  and  italy  for  a  while.  till  he  was  captured.  my

handed a large suit of clothes that he could roll around in and whose sleeves would drag behind him. but he knew he did not 
like it. he was accustomed to his invisibility. in england he was ignored in the various barracks, and he came to prefer that. 
the self-sufficiency and privacy hana saw in him later were caused not just by his being a sapper in the italian campaign. it 
was as much a result of being the anonymous member of another race, a part of the invisible world. he had built up defences 
of character against all that, trusting only those who befriended him. but that night in erith he knew he was capable of having 
wires attached to him that influenced all around him who did not have his specific talent.

kip walks out of the field where he has been digging, his left hand raised in front of him as if he has sprained it. 
he passes the scarecrow for hanaâ€™s garden, the crucifix with its hanging sardine cans, and moves uphill towards the villa. he 
cups the hand held in front of him with the other as if protecting the flame of a candle. hana meets him on the terrace, and he 
takes her hand and holds it against his. the ladybird circling the nail on his small finger quickly crosses over onto her wrist.

his body, a bright redness against what seems like volcanic flesh. 

 
 
in the library the fuze box is in midair, nudged off the counter by caravaggio when he turned to hanaâ€™s gleeful yell in the 

hall. before it reaches the floor kipâ€™s body slides underneath it, and he catches it in his hand. 

caravaggio glances down to see the young manâ€™s face blowing out all the air quickly through his cheeks. 
he thinks suddenly he owes him a life. 
kip begins to laugh, losing his shyness in front of the older man, holding up the box of wires. 
caravaggio will remember the slide. he could walk away, never see him again, and he would never forget him. years from 
now on

â€œi know all about sarongs.â€ caravaggio waved his hand towards kip and hana as he spoke. â€œin the east end of toronto i met 
these indians. i was robbing a house and it turned out to belong to an indian family. they woke from their beds and they were 
wearing these cloths, sarongs, to sleep in, and it intrigued me. we had lots to talk about and they eventually persuaded me to 
try it. i removed my clothes and stepped into one, and they immediately set upon me and chased me half naked into the night.â€

 in the habit of rising with daybreak and eating dinner in the last available light. throughout the late evening there 
would be only one candle flaring into the darkness beside the english patient, or a lamp half filled with oil if caravaggio had 
managed to forage any. but the corridors and other bedrooms hung in darkness, as if in a buried city. they became used to 
walking in darkness, hands out, touching the walls on either side with their fingertips. 

â€œno more light. no more colour.â€ hana would sing the phrase to herself again and again. kipâ€™s unnerving habit of leaping 
down the stairs one hand halfway down the rail had to be stopped. she imagined his feet travelling through air and hitting the 
returning caravaggio in the stomach. 

 
she had blown out the candle in the englishmanâ€™s room an hour earlier. she had removed her tennis shoes, her frock was 
unbuttoned at the neck because of summer heat, the sleeves unbuttoned as well and loose, high up at the arm. a sweet disor

 the kitchen, library and deserted chapel, was a glassed-in indoor courtyard. four 
walls of glass with a glass door that let you into where there was a covered well and shelves of dead plants that at one time

pressed flowers, something to be glanced at during passing, never entered. 

it was two a.m. 
each of them entered the villa from a different doorway, hana at the chapel entrance by the thirty-six steps and he at the 
north courtyard. as he stepped into the house he removed his watch and slid it into an alcove at chest level where a small saint 
rested. the patron of this villa hospital. she would not catch a glance of phosphorus. he had already removed his shoes and 
wore just trousers. the lamp strapped to his arm was switched off. he carried nothing else and just stood there for a while in

caravaggio  lay  on  the  carpet  at  the  far  end  of  the  library.  from  his  darkness  it  seemed  that  hanaâ€™s  left  arm  was  raw 
phosphorus, lighting the books, reflecting redness onto her dark hair, burning against the cotton of her  frock and its  puffed 
sleeve at her shoulder. 

 
he came out of the well. 
 
the three-foot diameter of light spread from her arm and then was absorbed into blackness, so it felt to caravaggio that there 
was a valley of darkness between them. she tucked the book with the brown cover under her right arm. as she moved, new 
books emerged and others disappeared.

she had grown older. and he loved her more now than he loved her when he had understood her better, when she was the 
product of her parents. what she was now was what she herself had decided to become. he knew that if he had passed hana on 
a street in europe she would have had a familiar air but he wouldnâ€™t have recognized her. the night he had first come to the 
villa he had disguised his shock. her ascetic face, which at first seemed cold, had a sharpness. he realized that during the last 
two months he had grown towards who she now was. he could hardly believe his pleasure at her translation. years before, he

was she conscious of him in the room? caravaggio was aware of the noisiness of his breath and the difficulty he was having 

breathing in an ordered, demure way. the light went on for a moment and then was quickly shut off again. 

then everything in the room seemed to be in movement but caravaggio. he could hear it all around him, surprised he wasnâ€™t 
touched. the boy was in the room. caravaggio walked over to the sofa and placed his hand down towards hana. she was not 
there. as he straightened up, an arm went around his neck and pulled him down backwards in a grip. a light glared harshly 
into his face, and there was a gasp from them both as they fell towards the floor. the arm with the light still holding him at the 
neck. then a naked foot emerged into the light, moved past caravaggioâ€™s face and stepped onto the boyâ€™s neck beside him.

that gesture she loves which is partly a nod, partly a shake of possible disagreement. he cannot see her for the glare. he turns 
off her light so they are equal in darkness. 

 
there is the one month in their lives when hana and kip sleep beside each other. a formal celibacy between them. dis-

his deepest sleep while in the arms of hana, his orgasm something more to do with the pull of the moon, a tug of his body by 
the night.

raking  his  back.  it  was  something  an  ayah  had  taught  him  years  earlier.  all  comfort  and  peace  during  childhood,  kip

room where she wept wildly and formally. he watched as she collected her tears in a small glass cup held against her face. she 
would take this, he knew, to the funeral. he was behind her hunched-over body, his nine-year-old hands on her shoulders, and 
when  she  was  finally  still,  just  now  and  then  a  shudder,  he  began  to  scratch  her  through  the  sari,  then  pulled  it  aside  and 
scratched her skinâ€”as hana now received this tender art, his nails against the million cells of her skin, in his tent, in 1945, 
where their continents met in a hill town.

the porcelain basin to his chest. when she finishes she runs her wet fingers through her hair a few times, so it turns damp and 
dark. she looks up and sees his eyes are open, and smiles. 

when he opens his eyes again, madox is there, looking ragged, weary, carrying the morphinic injection, having to use both 
hands because there are no thumbs. how does he give it to himself? he thinks. he recognizes

all day they have shared the ampoules of morphine. to unthread the story out of him, caravaggio travels within the code of 
signals. when the burned man slows down, or when caravaggio feels he is not catching everythingâ€”the love affair, the death 
of madoxâ€”he picks up the syringe from the kidney-shaped enamel tin, breaks the glass tip off an ampoule with the pressure of 
a knuckle and loads it. he is blunt about all this now with hana, having ripped the sleeve off his left arm completely. almasy 
wears just a grey singlet, so his black arm lies bare under the sheet. 

each swallow of morphine by the body opens a further door, or he leaps back to the cave paintings or to a buried plane or 

lingers once more with the woman beside him under a fan, her cheek against his stomach. 

caravaggio picks up the herodotus. he turns a page, comes over a dune to discover the gilf kebir, uweinat, gebel kissu.

caravaggio  wants to rise and walk away from this villa, the country, the detritus of a war. he is just a thief. what cara-
vaggio wants is his arms around the sapper and hana or, better, people of his own age, in a bar where he knows everyone, 
where he can dance and talk with a woman, rest his head on her shoulder, lean his head against her brow, whatever, but he 
knows first he must get out of this desert, its architecture of morphine. he needs to pull away from the invisible road to el taj. 
this man he believes to be almasy has used him and the morphine to return to his own world, for his own sadness. it no longer 
matters which side he was on during the war.

 he would rub his jaw, his face creasing up, the eyes closed, to think in darkness, and only then would he blurt out 
something, tearing himself away from his own thoughts. it was this darkness that showed in him as he sat in the rhomboid 
frame of light, hunched over a chair beside almasyâ€™s bed. one of the two older men in this story. 

â€œi can talk with you, caravaggio, because i feel we are both mortal. the girl, the boy, they are not mortal yet. in spite of

ask her to read to me... do you realize neither of us has children?â€

everything i have loved or valued has been taken away from me. 
i stayed with her. i discovered three of her ribs were broken. i kept waiting for her wavering eye, for her broken wrist to

â€œi think kip is the eccentric myself. where is he, anyway?â€ 
â€œheâ€™s plotting something on the terrace, doesnâ€™t want me out there. something for my birthday.â€ hana stood up from her 

crouch at the grate, wiping her hand on the opposite forearm. 

â€œfor your birthday iâ€™m going to tell you a small story,â€ he said. 
she looked at him. 
â€œnot about patrick, okay?â€ 
â€œa little about patrick, mostly about you.â€ 
â€œi still canâ€™t listen to those stories, david.â€

â€œi can get you off the morphine, you know. iâ€™m a good nurse.â€ 
â€œyouâ€™re surrounded by madmen...â€ 
â€œyes, i think we are all mad.â€ 
when kip called them, they walked out of the kitchen and onto the terrace, whose border, with its low stone balustrade, was 

ringed with light. 

it looked to caravaggio like a string of small electric candles found in dusty churches, and he thought the sapper had gone 
too far in removing them from a chapel, even for hanaâ€™s birthday. hana walked slowly forward with her hands over her face. 
there was no wind. her legs and thighs moved through the skirt of her frock as if it were thin water. her tennis shoes silent on 
the stone. 

â€œi kept finding dead shells wherever i was digging,â€ the sapper said. 
they  still  didnâ€™t  understand.  caravaggio  bent  over  the  flutter  of  lights.  they  were  snail  shells  filled  with  oil.  he  looked 

along the row of them; there must have been about forty.

forty-five,â€ kip said, â€œthe years so far of this century. where i come from, we celebrate the age as well as ourselves.â€ 
hana moved alongside them, her hands in her pockets now, the way kip loved to see her walk. so relaxed, as if she had put 

her arms away for the night, now in simple armless movement. 

caravaggio  was diverted by the startling presence of three bottles of red wine on the table. he  walked over and read the 
labels and shook his head, amazed. he knew the sapper wouldnâ€™t drink any of it. all three had already been opened. kip must 
have picked his way through some etiquette book in the library. th

en he saw the corn and the meat and the potatoes. hana slid 
her arm into kipâ€™s and came with him to the table. 

they ate and drank, the unexpected thickness of the wine like meat on their tongues. they were soon turning silly in their 
toasts to the sapperâ€”â€the great foragerâ€â€”and to the english patient. they toasted each other, kip joining in with his beaker of 
water. this was when he began to talk about himself. caravaggio pressing him on, not always listening, sometimes standing up 
and walking around the table, pacing and pacing wit

 the sapper rolled his head, half nodding, half shaking it, his mouth smiling. so 
caravaggio began to talk, mostly to kip. 

the  dog  cautiously  approached  the  table  and  laid  its  head  on  caravaggioâ€™s  lap.  the  sapper  asked  for  other  stories  about 
toronto as if it were a place of peculiar wonders. snow that drowned the city, iced up the harbour, ferryboats in the summer 
where  people  listened  to  concerts.  but  what  he  was  really  interested  in  were  the  clues  to  hanaâ€™s  nature,  though  she  was 
evasive, veering caravaggio away from stories that involved some moment of her life. she wanted kip to know her only in the 
present, a person perhaps more flawed or more compassionate or harder or more obsessed than the girl or young woman she

and nowâ€”because he was quite drunkâ€”caravaggio told the story of hanaâ€™s singing the â€œmarseillaise,â€ which he had told 
her before. â€œyes, i have heard the song,â€ said kip, and he attempted a version of it. â€œno, you have to sing it out,â€ said hana, 
â€œyou have to sing it standing up!â€ 

she stood up, pulled her tennis shoes off and climbed onto the table. there were four snail lights flickering, almost dying, on 

the table beside her bare feet. 

â€œthis is for you. this is how you must learn to sing it, kip. this is for you.â€ 
she sang up into darkness beyond their snail light, beyond the square of light from the english patientâ€™s room and into the 

dark sky waving with shadows of cypress. her hands came out of their pockets.

kip had heard the song in the camps, sung by groups of men, often during strange moments, such as before an impromptu 
soccer match. and caravaggio when he had heard it in the last few years of the war never really liked it, never liked to listen to 
it. in his heart he had hanaâ€™s version from many years before. now he listened with a pleasure because she was singing again, 
but this  was quickly altered by the  way she  sang. not the passion of  her at  sixteen but echoing the  tentative circle  of light 
around her in the darkness. she was singing it as if it was something scarred, as if one couldnâ€™t ever again bring all the hope of 
the song together. it had been altered by the five years leading to this night of her twenty-first birthday in the forty-fifth year

kip  walks  her  beside  a  pool  to  the  tree  shrine  where  baba  gujhaji,  the  first  priest  of  the  temple,  is  buried.  a  tree  of 
superstitions, four hundred and fifty years old. â€œmy mother came here to tie a string onto a branch and beseeched the tree for a 
son, and when my brother was born returned and asked to be blessed with another. there are sacred trees and magic water all 
over the punjab.â€ 

hana is quiet. he knows the depth of darkness in her, her lack of a child and of faith. he is always coaxing her from the edge 

of her fields of sadness. a child lost. a father lost. 

â€œi have lost someone like a father as well,â€ he has said. but she knows this man beside her is one of the charmed, who has 
grown up an outsider and so can switch allegiances, can replace loss. there are those destroyed by unfairness and those who 
are not. if she asks him he will say he has had a good life â€”hi

he seems to like such temporal habits. she or caravaggio will see his figure in the distance, pausing in his walk home to 
look back towards the valley to see how far away the rain is from him. hana and caravaggio return to the house. kip continues 
his half-mile uphill walk on the path that curls slowly to the right and then slowly to the left. there is the noise of his boots on 
the gravel. the wind reaches him in bursts, hitting the cypresses broadside so they tilt, entering the sleeves of his shirt. 

for the next ten minutes he walks, never sure if the rain will overtake him. he will hear the rain before he feels it, a clicking

qualms under the trees in his patch of garden during such storms, the dangers of being killed by lightning pathetically minimal

up and pulls away the hearing aid, and drops it to the floor.

nostrils, fast and hard, a piston.

caravaggio sits down in the chair. he is always, he thinks, sitting in this chair. in the room there is the thin squawking from 
the crystal set, the radio still speaking in its underwater voice. he cannot bear to turn and look at the sapper or look towards the 
blur of hanaâ€™s frock. he knows the young soldier is right. they would never have dropped such a bomb on a white nation.

while  the  sapper  unearthed  the  motorcycle  from  under  the  tarpaulin,  caravaggio  leaned  forward  on  the  parapet,  his  chin

gunned the motorbike to life and sat on it while it half bucked, alive under him, and hana stood nearby. 
singh touched her arm and let the machine roll away, down the slope, and only then revved it to life. 
halfway down the path to the gate, caravaggio was waiting for him, carrying the gun. he didnâ€™t even lift it formally towards 
the motorbike when the boy slowed down, as caravaggio walked into his path. caravaggio came up to him and put his arms 
around  him.  a  great  hug.  the  sapper  felt  the  stubble  against  his  skin  for  the  first  time.  he  felt  drawn  in,  gath

around two in the afternoon he reached ortona, where the sappers had laid the bailey bridges, nearly drowning in the storm 
in mid-river. it began to rain and he stopped to put on a rubber cape. he walked around the machine in the wetness. now, as he 
travelled, the sound in his ears changed. the shush shush replacing the whine and howl, the water flung onto his boots from the 
front wheel. everything he saw through the goggles was grey. he would not think of hana. in all the silence within the bikeâ€™s 
noise he did not think of her. 

when her face appeared he erased it, pulled the handlebars so he would swerve and have to concentrate. if there were to be 

words they would not be hers; they would be names on this map of italy he was riding through.

he doesnâ€™t know what her profession is or what her circumstances are, although he sees her reactions to people around her, her 
bending down to children, a white fridge door behind her, a background of noiseless tram cars. this is a limited gift he has 
somehow been given, as if a cameraâ€™s film reveals her, but only her, in silence. he cannot discern the company she moves
