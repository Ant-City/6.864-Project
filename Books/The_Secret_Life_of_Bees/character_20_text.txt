rough the house—a torture chamber of food staples, 
where i would go from one pile to the next, kneeling for 
hours on end with nothing but bathroom breaks. i didn't 
care.  i  couldn't  think  of  anything  but  rosaleen  back 
there in jail. 

i  squinted  at  him  sideways.  "what  about 

rosaleen? you have to get her out—" 

"you're lucky i got you out!" he yelled. 
"but she can't stay there—" 
"she  dumped  snuff  juice  on  three  white  men! 
what the hell was she thinking? and on franklin posey, 
for  christ's  sake.  she  couldn't  pick  somebody  normal? 
he's the meanest nigger-hater in sylvan. he'd as soon kill 
her as look at her." 

"but  not  really,"  i  said.  "you  don't  mean  he 

would really kill her." 

"what  i  mean  is,  i  wouldn't  be  surprised  if  he 

flat-out killed her." 

my arms felt weak in their sockets. 
franklin  posey was  the man  with  the flashlight, 
and  he  was  gonna  kill  rosaleen.  but  then,  hadn't  i 
known this inside even before t. ray e
