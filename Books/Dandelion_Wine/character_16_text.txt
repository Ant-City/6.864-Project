t month, maybe, we'll get away." 

"i'm not complaining!" she cried. "i'm not the one comes in with a list saying/stick out 
your tongue. lee, do you ask what makes your heart beat all night? no! next will you 
ask, what's marriage? who knows, lee? don't ask. a man who thinks like that, how it 
runs, how things work, falls off the trapeze in the circus, chokes wondering how the 
muscles work in the throat. eat, sleep, breathe, lee, and stop staring at me like i'm 
something new in the house!" 

lena auffmann froze. she sniffed the air. 

"oh, my god, look what you done!" 

she yanked the oven door open. a great cloud of smoke poured through the kitchen. 

"happiness!" she wailed. "and for the first time in six months we have a fight! 
happiness, and for the first time in twenty years it's not bread, it's charcoal for supper!" 

when the smoke cleared, leo auffmann was gone. 



the fearful clangor, the collision of man and inspiration, the flinging about of metal, 
lumber, hammer, nails, t square,

, no mad scientist lives like leo auffmann, none!" 

"you're leaving, and you haven't even tried the machine!" he protested. "try it once, 
you'll unpack, you'll stay!" 

"tom swift and his electric annihilator— whose is that?" she asked. "must i guess?"

snorting, she gave tom swift to leo auffmann. 



very late in the day all the books, dishes, clothes, linens had been stacked one here, 
one there, four here, four there, ten here, ten there. lena auffmann, dizzy with counting, 
had to sit down. "all right," she gasped. "before i go, lee, prove you don't give 
nightmares to innocent sons!" 

silently leo auffmann led his wife into the twilight. she stood before the eight-foot- 
tall, orange-colored box. 

"that's happiness?" she said. "which button do i press to be overjoyed, grateful, 
contented, and much-obliged?" 

the children had gathered now. 

"mama," said saul, "don't!" 

"i got to know what i'm yelling about, saul." she got in the machin

wreck, shouting." 

"please," he said, "you'll see!" 

he shut the door. 

"press the button!" he shouted in at his unseen wife. 

there was a click. the machine shivered quietly, like a huge dog dreaming in its sleep. 
"papa!" said saul, worried. 
"listen!" said leo auffmann. 

at first there was nothing but the tremor of the machine's own secretly moving cogs 
and wheels. 

"is mama all right?" asked naomi. 

"all right, she's fine! there, now . . . there!" 

and inside the machine lena auffmann could be heard saying, "oh!" and then again, 
"ah!" in a startled voice. "look at that!" said his hidden wife. "paris!" and later, "london! 
there goes rome! the pyramids! the sphinx!" "the sphinx, you hear, children?" leo 
auffmann whispered and laughed.

"perfume!" cried lena auffmann, surprised.

somewhere a phonograph played "the blue danube" faintly. 
"music! i'm dancing!" 

"only thinks she's dancing" the father confided to the world.

"amazing!" said the unseen woman. 

leo auffmann blushed. "what an understanding wife." 

and then inside the happiness machine, lena auffmann began to weep. 

the inventor's smile faded. 

"she's crying" said naomi. 

"she can't be!" 

"she is," said saul. 

"she simply can't be crying!" leo auffmann, blinking, pressed his ear to the machine. 
"but . . .yes . . .like a baby . . ." 

he could only open the door. 

"wait." there his wife sat, tears rolling down her cheeks. "let me finish." she cried 
some more. 

leo auffmann turned off the machine, stunned. 

"oh, it's the saddest thing in the world!" she wailed. "i feel awful, terrib

wo, a sunset. after that, let's have something else. people are like that, lee. how 
could you forget?" 

"did i?" 

"sunsets we always liked because they only happen once and go away." 
"but lena, that's sad." 

"no, if the sunset stayed and we got bored, that would be a real sadness. so two 
things you did you should never have. you made quick things go slow and stay around. 
you brought things faraway to our backyard where they don't belong, where they just tell 
you/no, you'll never travel, lena auffmann, paris you'll never see! pome you'll never 
visit. ' but i always knew that, so why tell me? better to forget and make do, lee, make 
do, eh?" 

leo auffmann leaned against the machine for support. he snatched his burned hand 
away, surprised. 

"so now what, lena?" he said. 

"it's not for me to say. i know only so long as this thing is here i'll want to come out, 
or saul will want to come out like he did last night, and against our judgment sit in it and

his wife nodded. "we'll wait, lee." 

he shut the door. in the warm darkness he hesitated, pressed the button, and was 
just relaxing back in color and music, when he heard someone screaming. 

"fire, papa! the machine's on fire!" 

someone hammered the door. he leaped up, bumped his head, and fell as the door 
gave way and the boys dragged him out. behind him he heard a muffled explosion. the 
entire family was running now. leo auffmann turned and gasped, "saul, call the fire 
department!" 

lena auffmann caught saul as he ran. "saul," she said. "wait." 

there was a gush of flame, another muffled explosion. when the machine was burning 
very well indeed, lena auffmann nodded. 

"all right, saul," she said. "run call the fire department." 



everybody who was anybody came to the fire. there was grandpa spaulding and 
douglas and tom and most of the boarders and some of the old men from across the 
ravine and all the children from six blocks around. and leo auffmann's children stood out 
front,

proud of how fine the flames looked jumping from the garage roof. 

grandfather spaulding studied the smoke ball in the sky and said, quietly, "lee, was 
that it? your happiness machine?" 

"some year," said leo auffmann "i'll figure it and tell you." 

lena auffmann, standing in the dark now, watched as the firemen ran in and out of 
the yard; the garage, roaring, settled upon itself. 

"leo," she said, "it won't take a year to figure. look around. think. keep quiet a little 
bit. then come tell me. i'll be in the house, putting books back on shelves, and clothes 
back in closets, fixing supper, supper's late, look how dark. come, children, help mama."

red leo auffmann, "the front window. quiet, and you'll see it." 

hesitantly, grandfather, douglas, and tom peered through the large windowpane. 

and there, in small warm pools of lamplight, you could see what leo auffmann wanted 
you to see. there sat saul and marshall, playing chess at the coffee table. in the dining 
room rebecca was laying out the silver. naomi was cutting paper-doll dresses. ruth was 
painting water colors. joseph was running his electric train. through the kitchen door, 
lena auffmann was sliding a pot roast from the steaming oven. every hand, every head, 
every mouth made a big or little motion. you could hear their faraway voices under glass. 
you could hear someone singing in a high sweet voice. you could smell bread baking, 
too, and you knew it was real bread that would soon be covered with real butter. 
everything was there and it was working. 

grandfather, douglas, and tom turned to look at leo auffmann, who gazed serenely 
through the window, the pink light on his c
