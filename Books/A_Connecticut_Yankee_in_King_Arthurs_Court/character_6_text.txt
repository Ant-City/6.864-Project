   him had ye not been; therefore, to yield us unto
   him it were no reason.  well, as to that, said
   sir launcelot, advise you well, for ye may
   choose whether ye will die or live, for an ye be
   yielden, it shall be unto sir kay.  fair knight,
   then they said, in saving our lives we will do
   as thou commandest us.  then shall ye, said sir
   launcelot, on whitsunday next coming go unto the
   court of king arthur, and there shall ye yield
   you unto queen guenever, and put you all three
   in her grace and mercy, and say that sir kay
   sent you thither to be her prisoners.  on the morn
   sir launcelot arose early, and left sir kay
   sleeping; and sir launcelot took sir kay’s armor
   and his shield and armed him, and so he went to
   the stable and took his horse, and took his leave
   of his host, and so he departed.  then soon after
   arose sir kay and missed sir launcelot; and
   then he espied that he had his armor and his
   horse. now by my f

fight against nine foreign knights, and straightway took the battle
solely into his own hands, and conquered the nine; and that night
sir launcelot rose quietly, and dressed him in sir kay’s armor and
took sir kay’s horse and gat him away into distant lands, and
vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four
in another; and all these and the former nine he made to swear
that about whitsuntide they would ride to arthur’s court and yield
them to queen guenever’s hands as captives of sir kay the seneschal,
spoil of his knightly prowess; and now here were these half dozen,
and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of
their desperate wounds.

well, it was touching to see the queen blush and smile, and look
embarrassed and happy, and fling furtive glances at sir launcelot
that would have got him shot in arkansas, to a dead certainty.

everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of sir launcelot; and
as for me, i was perfectly amazed,

of mind enough not to mention it.

they were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were
mightily relieved, at last, when old merlin swept the difficulty
away for them with a common-sense hint.  he asked them why they
were so dull--why didn’t it occur to them to strip me.  in half a
minute i was as naked as a pair of tongs!  and dear, dear, to think
of it: i was the only embarrassed person there.  everybody discussed
me; and did it as unconcernedly as if i had been a cabbage.
queen guenever was as naively interested as the rest, and said
she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before.  it was
the only compliment i got--if it was a compliment.

finally i was carried off in one direction, and my perilous clothes
in another.  i was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon,
with some scant remnants for dinner, some moldy straw for a bed,
and no end of rats for company.

r it, i mean--and it wouldn’t be
right to disappoint the house and it wouldn’t make a delay worth
considering, anyway, it was only a one-night stand.  and i thought
he ought to tell the queen he was going away.  he clouded up at
that and looked sad.  i was sorry i had spoken, especially when
he said mournfully:

“thou forgettest that launcelot is here; and where launcelot is,
she noteth not the going forth of the king, nor what day he returneth.”

of course, i changed the subject.  yes, guenever was beautiful,
it is true, but take her all around she was pretty slack.  i never
meddled in these matters, they weren’t my affair, but i did hate
to see the way things were going on, and i don’t mind saying that
much.  many’s the time she had asked me, “sir boss, hast seen
sir launcelot about?” but if ever she went fretting around for
the king i didn’t happen to be around at the time.

there was a very good lay-out for the king’s-evil business--very
tidy and creditable.  the king

ift as much as you want to; and i generally do.  the old
gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown
origin, as a rule, but some of them were roman; they were ill-shapen,
and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full; they
were hammered, not minted, and they were so worn with use that
the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters, and looked
like them.  i judged that a sharp, bright new nickel, with a
first-rate likeness of the king on one side of it and guenever
on the other, and a blooming pious motto, would take the tuck out
of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous
fancy more; and i was right.  this batch was the first it was
tried on, and it worked to a charm.  the saving in expense was
a notable economy.  you will see that by these figures: we touched
a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients; at former rates, this would
have cost the government about $240; at the new rate we pulled
through for about $35, thus saving upward of $2

result, they decided that it was time to waive etiquette and send
their greatest and best against me.  to the astonishment of that
little world, i lassoed sir lamorak de galis, and after him
sir galahad.  so you see there was simply nothing to be done now,
but play their right bower--bring out the superbest of the superb,
the mightiest of the mighty, the great sir launcelot himself!

a proud moment for me?  i should think so.  yonder was arthur,
king of britain; yonder was guenever; yes, and whole tribes of
little provincial kings and kinglets; and in the tented camp yonder,
renowned knights from many lands; and likewise the selectest body
known to chivalry, the knights of the table round, the most
illustrious in christendom; and biggest fact of all, the very sun
of their shining system was yonder couching his lance, the focal
point of forty thousand adoring eyes; and all by myself, here was
i laying for him.  across my mind flitted the dear image of a

and told us to smoke as much as we pleased, it couldn’t get under
the canopy, and she was used to smoke, being the first lady in the
land who had ever seen a cloud blown.  well, there couldn’t be
a more contented or comfortable sight than sir launcelot in his
noble armor sitting in gracious serenity at the end of a yard
of snowy church-warden.  he was a beautiful man, a lovely man,
and was just intended to make a wife and children happy.  but, of
course guenever--however, it’s no use to cry over what’s done and
can’t be helped.

well, he stood watch-and-watch with me, right straight through,
for three days and nights, till the child was out of danger; then
he took her up in his great arms and kissed her, with his plumes
falling about her golden head, then laid her softly in sandy’s
lap again and took his stately way down the vast hall, between
the ranks of admiring men-at-arms and menials, and so disappeared.

drawn tight.  he sprang up and rushed for me eagerly, saying:

“oh, it’s worth a billion milrays to look upon a live person again!”

he knew me as easily as if i hadn’t been disguised at all.  which
frightened me; one may easily believe that.

“quick, now, tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster,” i said.
“how did it come about?”

“well, if there hadn’t been any queen guenever, it wouldn’t have
come so early; but it would have come, anyway.  it would have
come on your own account by and by; by luck, it happened to come
on the queen’s.”

“_and_ sir launcelot’s?”

“just so.”

“give me the details.”

“i reckon you will grant that during some years there has been
only one pair of eyes in these kingdoms that has not been looking
steadily askance at the queen and sir launcelot--”

“yes.  sir mordred set himself at once to work to make his kingship
permanent.  he was going to marry guenever, as a first move; but
she fled and shut herself up in the tower of london.  mordred
attacked; the bishop of canterbury dropped down on him with the
