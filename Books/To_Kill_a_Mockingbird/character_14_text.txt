bove her knees. she went up to the front steps and banged on the door. she got
no answer, and she shouted, â€œmr. nathan, mr. arthur, mad dogâ€™s cominâ€˜! mad
dogâ€™s cominâ€™!â€
â€œsheâ€™s supposed to go around in back,â€ i said.
jem shook his head. â€œdonâ€™t make any difference now,â€ he said.
calpurnia pounded on the door in vain. no one acknowledged her warning; no
one seemed to have heard it.
as calpurnia sprinted to the back porch a black ford swung into the driveway.
atticus and mr. heck tate got out.
mr. heck tate was the sheriff of maycomb county. he was as tall as atticus, but
thinner. he was long-nosed, wore boots with shiny metal eye-holes, boot pants
and a lumber jacket. his belt had a row of bullets sticking in it. he carried a heavy
rifle. when he and atticus reached the porch, jem opened the door.
â€œstay inside, son,â€ said atticus. â€œwhere is he, cal?â€
â€œhe oughta be here by now,â€ said calpurnia, pointing down the street.
â€œnot runninâ€˜, is he?â€ asked mr. tate.

alexandra was in her chair
in the corner, atticus was in his; jem and i were on the floor reading. it had been
a placid week: i had minded aunty; jem had outgrown the treehouse, but helped
dill and me construct a new rope ladder for it; dill had hit upon a foolproof plan
to make boo radley come out at no cost to ourselves (place a trail of lemon drops
from the back door to the front yard and heâ€™d follow it, like an ant). there was a
knock on the front door, jem answered it and said it was mr. heck tate.
â€œwell, ask him to come in,â€ said atticus.
â€œi already did. thereâ€™s some men outside in the yard, they want you to come out.â€
in maycomb, grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two reasons:
death and politics. i wondered who had died. jem and i went to the front door, but
atticus called, â€œgo back in the house.â€
jem turned out the livingroom lights and pressed his nose to a window screen.
aunt alexandra protested. â€œjust for a second, aunty, letâ€™s see who it is,â€ he

 i asked.
â€œsort of. she wonâ€™t let him alone about tom robinson. she almost said atticus
was disgracinâ€˜ the family. scoutâ€¦ iâ€™m scared.â€
â€œscaredâ€™a what?â€
â€œscared about atticus. somebody might hurt him.â€ jem preferred to remain
mysterious; all he would say to my questions was go on and leave him alone.
next day was sunday. in the interval between sunday school and church when
the congregation stretched its legs, i saw atticus standing in the yard with another
knot of men. mr. heck tate was present, and i wondered if he had seen the light.
he never went to church. even mr. underwood was there. mr. underwood had
no use for any organization but the maycomb tribune, of which he was the sole
owner, editor, and printer. his days were spent at his linotype, where he refreshed
himself occasionally from an ever-present gallon jug of cherry wine. he rarely
gathered news; people brought it to him. it was said that he made up every edition
of the maycomb tribune out of his own head and w

watching him put a long dry cigar into his mouth and munch it slowly up. bit by

mess, its essence extracted and mingling with judge taylorâ€™s digestive juices. i
once asked atticus how mrs. taylor stood to kiss him, but atticus said they
didnâ€™t kiss much.
the witness stand was to the right of judge taylor, and when we got to our seats

mr. heck tate was already on it.

â€œjem,â€ i said, â€œare those the ewells sittinâ€˜ down yonder?â€
â€œhush,â€ said jem, â€œmr. heck tateâ€™s testifyinâ€˜.â€
mr. tate had dressed for the occasion. he wore an ordinary business suit, which
made him look somehow like every other man: gone were his high boots, lumber
jacket, and bullet-studded belt. from that moment he ceased to terrify me. he was
sitting forward in the witness chair, his hands clasped between his knees,

when i got distangled i run up to thâ€˜ window and i seenâ€”â€ mr. ewellâ€™s face grew
scarlet. he stood up and pointed his finger at tom robinson. â€œâ€”i seen that black
nigger yonder ruttinâ€™ on my mayella!â€
so serene was judge taylorâ€™s court, that he had few occasions to use his gavel,
but he hammered fully five minutes. atticus was on his feet at the bench saying
something to him, mr. heck tate as first officer of the county stood in the middle
aisle quelling the packed courtroom. behind us, there was an angry muffled groan
from the colored people.
reverend sykes leaned across dill and me, pulling at jemâ€™s elbow. â€œmr. jem,â€ he
said, â€œyou better take miss jean louise home. mr. jem, you hear me?â€
jem turned his head. â€œscout, go home. dill, youâ€™nâ€˜scout go home.â€
â€œyou gotta make me first,â€ i said, remembering atticusâ€™s blessed dictum.
jem scowled furiously at me, t

warranted immediate medical attention?â€

â€œwhat?â€
â€œdidnâ€™t you think she should have had a doctor, immediately?â€
the witness said he never thought of it, he had never called a doctor to any of
hisâ€™n in his life, and if he had it would have cost him five dollars. â€œthat all?â€ he
asked.
â€œnot quite,â€ said atticus casually. â€œmr. ewell, you heard the sheriffâ€™s testimony,
didnâ€™t you?â€
â€œhowâ€™s that?â€
â€œyou were in the courtroom when mr. heck tate was on the stand, werenâ€™t you?
you heard everything he said, didnâ€™t you?â€
mr. ewell considered the matter carefully, and seemed to decide that the question
was safe.
â€œyes,â€ he said.
â€œdo you agree with his description of mayellaâ€™s injuries?â€
â€œhowâ€™s that?â€
atticus looked around at mr. gilmer and smiled. mr. ewell seemed determined
not to give the defense the time of day.
â€œmr. tate testified that her right eye was blackened, that she was beaten around

emed to be having a quiet fit. he was pounding the balcony rail softly, and
once he whispered, â€œweâ€™ve got him.â€
i didnâ€™t think so: atticus was trying to show, it seemed to me, that mr. ewell
could have beaten up mayella. that much i could follow. if her right eye was
blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face, it would tend to
show that a left-handed person did it. sherlock holmes and jem finch would
agree. but tom robinson could easily be left-handed, too. like mr. heck tate, i
imagined a person facing me, went through a swift mental pantomime, and
concluded that he might have held her with his right hand and pounded her with
his left. i looked down at him. his back was to us, but i could see his broad
shoulders and bull-thick neck. he could easily have done it. i thought jem was
counting his chickens.

a young girl walked to the witness stand. as she raised her hand

â€˜he caught me and
choked me and took advantage of meâ€™â€”is that right?â€
â€œthatâ€™s what i said.â€
â€œdo you remember him beating you about the face?â€
the witness hesitated.
â€œyou seem sure enough that he choked you. all this time you were fighting back,

remember? you â€˜kicked and hollered as loud as you could.â€™ do you remember
him beating you about the face?â€
mayella was silent. she seemed to be trying to get something clear to herself. i
thought for a moment she was doing mr. heck tateâ€™s and my trick of pretending
there was a person in front of us. she glanced at mr. gilmer.
â€œitâ€™s an easy question, miss mayella, so iâ€™ll try again. do you remember him
beating you about the face?â€ atticusâ€™s voice had lost its comfortableness; he was
speaking in his arid, detached professional voice. â€œdo you remember him beating
you about the face?â€
â€œno, i donâ€™t recollect if he hit me. i mean yes i do, he hit me.â€
â€œwas your last sentence your answer?â€
â€œhuh? yes, he hi

im the rest of the
afternoon, now. you watch.â€ unaware of public scrutiny from above, judge
taylor disposed of the severed end by propelling it expertly to his lips and saying,
â€œfhluck!â€ he hit a spittoon so squarely we could hear it slosh. â€œbet he was hell
with a spitball,â€ murmured dill.
as a rule, a recess meant a general exodus, but today people werenâ€™t moving.
even the idlers who had failed to shame younger men from their seats had
remained standing along the walls. i guess mr. heck tate had reserved the county
toilet for court officials.
atticus and mr. gilmer returned, and judge taylor looked at his watch. â€œitâ€™s
gettinâ€˜ on to four,â€ he said, which was intriguing, as the courthouse clock must
have struck the hour at least twice. i had not heard it or felt its vibrations.
â€œshall we try to wind up this afternoon?â€ asked judge taylor. â€œhow â€˜bout it,

atticus?â€
â€œi think we can,â€ said atticus.
â€œhow many witnesses you got?â€
â€œone.â€
â€œwell, call him.â€

ast winter, and
i shivered, though the night was hot. the feeling grew until the atmosphere in the
courtroom was exactly the same as a cold february morning, when the
mockingbirds were still, and the carpenters had stopped hammering on miss
maudieâ€™s new house, and every wood door in the neighborhood was shut as tight
as the doors of the radley place. a deserted, waiting, empty street, and the
courtroom was packed with people. a steaming summer night was no different
from a winter morning. mr. heck tate, who had entered the courtroom and was
talking to atticus, might have been wearing his high boots and lumber jacket.
atticus had stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto the bottom rung
of a chair; as he listened to what mr. tate was saying, he ran his hand slowly up
and down his thigh. i expected mr. tate to say any minute, â€œtake him, mr.
finchâ€¦â€
but mr. tate said, â€œthis court will come to order,â€ in a voice that rang with
authority, and the heads below us jerked up. mr

â€œweâ€™re the safest folks in the world,â€ said miss maudie. â€œweâ€™re so rarely called
on to be christians, but when we are, weâ€™ve got men like atticus to go for us.â€
jem grinned ruefully. â€œwish the rest of the county thought that.â€
â€œyouâ€™d be surprised how many of us do.â€
â€œwho?â€ jemâ€™s voice rose. â€œwho in this town did one thing to help tom
robinson, just who?â€
â€œhis colored friends for one thing, and people like us. people like judge taylor.
people like mr. heck tate. stop eating and start thinking, jem. did it ever strike
you that judge taylor naming atticus to defend that boy was no accident? that
judge taylor might have had his reasons for naming him?â€
this was a thought. court-appointed defenses were usually given to maxwell
green, maycombâ€™s latest addition to the bar, who needed the experience.
maxwell green should have had tom robinsonâ€™s case.
â€œyou think about that,â€ miss maudie was saying. â€œit was no accident. i was sittinâ€˜

women. miss maudie and aunt alexandra had never been especially close, and
here was aunty silently thanking her for something. for what, i knew not. i was
content to learn that aunt alexandra could be pierced sufficiently to feel gratitude
for help given. there was no doubt about it, i must soon enter this world, where
on its surface fragrant ladies rocked slowly, fanned gently, and drank cool water.
but i was more at home in my fatherâ€™s world. people like mr. heck tate did not
trap you with innocent questions to make fun of you; even jem was not highly
critical unless you said something stupid. ladies seemed to live in faint horror of
men, seemed unwilling to approve wholeheartedly of them. but i liked them.
there was something about them, no matter how much they cussed and drank and

gambled and chewed; no matter how undelectable they were, there was something
about them that i instinctively likedâ€¦ they werenâ€™tâ€”

â€œi heard â€˜em!â€ was the cry that awoke the misses barberâ€™s neighbors at dawn
next morning. â€œheard â€™em drive a truck up to the door! stomped around like
horses. theyâ€™re in new orleans by now!â€
miss tutti was sure those traveling fur sellers who came through town two days
ago had purloined their furniture. â€œda-rk they were,â€ she said. â€œsyrians.â€
mr. heck tate was summoned. he surveyed the area and said he thought it was a
local job. miss frutti said sheâ€™d know a maycomb voice anywhere, and there
were no maycomb voices in that parlor last nightâ€”rolling their râ€™s all over her
premises, they were. nothing less than the bloodhounds must be used to locate
their furniture, miss tutti insisted, so mr. tate was obliged to go ten miles out the
road, round up the county hounds, and put them on the trail.
mr. tate started them off at the misses barberâ€™

e he was talking, dr. reynolds had been looking keenly at me, lightly
fingering the bump that was coming on my forehead. â€œyou donâ€™t feel broke
anywhere, do you?â€
dr. reynoldsâ€™s small joke made me smile. â€œthen you donâ€™t think heâ€™s dead,
then?â€
he put on his hat. â€œnow i may be wrong, of course, but i think heâ€™s very alive.
shows all the symptoms of it. go have a look at him, and when i come back weâ€™ll
get together and decide.â€
dr. reynoldsâ€™s step was young and brisk. mr. heck tateâ€™s was not. his heavy
boots punished the porch and he opened the door awkwardly, but he said the same
thing dr. reynolds said when he came in. â€œyou all right, scout?â€ he added.
â€œyes sir, iâ€™m goinâ€˜ in to see jem. atticusâ€™nâ€™themâ€™s in there.â€
â€œiâ€™ll go with you,â€ said mr. tate.
aunt alexandra had shaded jemâ€™s reading light with a towel, and his room was
dim. jem was lying on his back. there was an ugly mark along one side of his
face. his left arm lay out from his body; h

heâ€™s out like a light. he was coming
around, but dr. reynolds put him out again.â€
â€œyes sir.â€ i retreated. jemâ€™s room was large and square. aunt alexandra was
sitting in a rocking-chair by the fireplace. the man who brought jem in was
standing in a corner, leaning against the wall. he was some countryman i did not
know. he had probably been at the pageant, and was in the vicinity when it
happened. he must have heard our screams and come running.
atticus was standing by jemâ€™s bed.
mr. heck tate stood in the doorway. his hat was in his hand, and a flashlight
bulged from his pants pocket. he was in his working clothes.

â€œcome in, heck,â€ said atticus. â€œdid you find anything? i canâ€™t conceive of
anyone low-down enough to do a thing like this, but i hope you found him.â€
mr. tate sniffed. he glanced sharply at the man in the corner, nodded to him, then
looked around the roomâ€”at jem, at aunt alexandra, then at atticus.
â€œsit down, mr. finch,â€ he said pleasantly.
atticus said,

â€œmr. arthur, honey,â€ said atticus, gently correcting me. â€œjean louise, this is mr.
arthur radley. i believe he already knows you.â€
if atticus could blandly introduce me to boo radley at a time like this, wellâ€”that
was atticus.
boo saw me run instinctively to the bed where jem was sleeping, for the same shy
smile crept across his face. hot with embarrassment, i tried to cover up by
covering jem up.
â€œah-ah, donâ€™t touch him,â€ atticus said.
mr. heck tate sat looking intently at boo through his horn-rimmed glasses. he
was about to speak when dr. reynolds came down the hall.
â€œeverybody out,â€ he said, as he came in the door. â€œeveninâ€˜, arthur, didnâ€™t notice
you the first time i was here.â€
dr. reynoldsâ€™s voice was as breezy as his step, as though he had said it every
evening of his life, an announcement that astounded me even more than being in
the same room with boo radley. of courseâ€¦ even boo radley got sick
sometimes, i thought. b
