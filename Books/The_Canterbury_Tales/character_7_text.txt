divinity, the philosophy, and the scholarship of his time, and
show him to have had the sciences, as then developed and
taught, "at his fingers' ends." another proof of chaucer's good
birth and fortune would he found in the statement that, after his
university career was completed, he entered the inner temple -
- the expenses of which could be borne only by men of noble
and opulent families; but although there is a story that he was
once fined two shillings for thrashing a franciscan friar in fleet
street, we have no direct authority for believing that the poet
devoted himself to the uncongenial study of the law. no special
display of knowledge on that subject appears in his works; yet
in the sketch of the manciple, in the prologue to the canterbury
tales, may be found indications of his familiarity with the
internal economy of the inns of court; while numerous legal
phrases and references hint that his comprehensive information
was not at fault on legal matters. leland says that

notes to the wife of bath's tale


1. it is not clear whence chaucer derived this tale. tyrwhitt
thinks it was taken from the story of florent, in the first book of
gower's "confessio amantis;" or perhaps from an older
narrative from which gower himself borrowed. chaucer has
condensed and otherwise improved the fable, especially by
laying the scene, not in sicily, but at the court of our own king
arthur.

2. limitours: begging friars. see note 18 to the prologue to the
tales.

3. thorpes: villages.  compare german, "dorf,"; dutch,
"dorp."

4. undermeles: evening-tides, afternoons; "undern" signifies the
evening; and "mele," corresponds to the german "mal" or
"mahl," time.

5. incubus: an evil spirit supposed to do violence to women; a
nightmare.

6. where he had been hawking after waterfowl. froissart says
that any one engaged in this sport "alloit en riviere."

7. nice: foolish; french, "niais."

8. claw us on the gall:

orted by vincent of beauvais,
occurs the passage which chaucer here paraphrases: -- "quid
est paupertas? odibile bonum; sanitas mater; remotio curarum;
sapientae repertrix; negotium sine damno; possessio absque
calumnia; sine sollicitudinae felicitas." (what is poverty? a
hateful good; a mother of health; a putting away of cares;  a
discoverer of wisdom; business without injury; ownership
without calumny; happiness without anxiety)

15. elenge: strange; from french "eloigner," to remove.

and afterward he said unto the frere,
"tell forth your tale, mine owen master dear."


notes to the prologue to the friar's tale


1. on the tale of the friar, and that of the sompnour which
follows, tyrwhitt has remarked that they "are well engrafted
upon that of the wife of bath. the ill-humour which shows
itself between these two characters is quite natural, as no two
professions at that time were at more constant variance.  the
regular clergy, and particularly the mendicant friars, affected a
total exemption from all ecclesiastical jurisdiction,  except that
of the pope, which made them exceedingly obnoxious t

duty of paying full tithes and offerings".

notes to the sompnour's tale


1. trentals: the money given to the priests for performing thirty
masses for the dead, either in succession or on the anniversaries
of their death; also the masses themselves, which were very
profitable to the clergy.

2. possessioners: the regular religious orders, who had lands
and fixed revenues; while the friars, by their vows, had to
depend on voluntary contributions, though their need suggested
many modes of evading the prescription.

3. in chaucer's day the most material notions about the tortures
of hell prevailed, and were made the most of by the clergy, who
preyed on the affection and fear of the survivors, through the
ingenious doctrine of purgatory. old paintings and illuminations
represent the dead as torn by hooks, roasted in fires, boiled in
pots, and subjected to many other physical tormen

ts.

4. qui cum patre: "who with the father"; the closing words of
the final benediction pronounced at mass.

5. askaunce: the word now means sideways or asquint; here it
means "as if;" and its force is probably to suggest that the
second friar, with an ostentatious stealthiness, noted down the
names of the liberal, to make them believe that they would be
remembered in the holy beggars' orisons.

6. a godde's kichel/halfpenny: a little cake/halfpenny, given for
god's sake.

7. harlot: hired servant; from anglo-saxon, "hyran," to hire;
the word was commonly applied to males.

8. potent: staff; french, "potence," crutch, gibbet.

9. je vous dis sans doute: french; "i tell you without doubt."

10. dortour: dormitory; french, "dortoir."


 
 ___________________________
 
12. the rules of st benedict granted peculiar honours and
immunities to monks who had lived fifty years -- the jubilee
period -- in the order. the usual reading of the words ending
the two lines is "loan" or "lone," and "alone;" but to walk alone
does not seem to have been any peculiar privilege of a friar,
while the idea of precedence, or higher place at table and in
processions, is suggested by the reading in the text.

13. borel folk:  laymen, people who are not learned; "borel"
was a kind of coarse cloth.

14. eli: elijah (1 kings, xix.)

15. an emperor jovinian was famous in the mediaeval  legends
for his pride and luxury

16. cor meum eructavit: literally, "my heart has belched forth;"
in our translation, (i.e. the authorised "king james" version -
transcriber) "my heart is inditing a goodl

21. the gysen:  seneca calls it the gyndes; sir john mandeville
tells the story of the euphrates. "gihon," was the name of one
of the four rivers of eden (gen. ii, 13).

22. him that harrowed hell: christ. see note 14 to the reeve's
tale.

23. mr. wright says that "it was a common practice to grant
under the conventual seal to benefactors and others a brotherly
participation in the spiritual good works of the convent, and in
their expected reward after death."

24. the friar had received a master's degree.

25. the regular number of monks or friars in a convent was
fixed at twelve,  with a superior, in imitation of the apostles and
their master; and large religious houses were held to consist of
so many convents.



the clerk's tale.


the prologue.


"sir clerk of oxenford," our hoste said,
"ye ride as still and coy, as doth a maid
that were new spoused, sitting at the board:
this day i heard not of your tongue a word.
i trow ye study about some sophime:*

for what man that is entered in a play,
he needes must unto that play assent.
but preache not, as friars do in lent,
to make us for our olde sinnes weep,
nor that thy tale make us not to sleep.
tell us some merry thing of aventures.
your terms, your coloures, and your figures,
keep them in store, till so be ye indite
high style, as when that men to kinges write.
speake so plain at this time, i you pray,
that we may understande what ye say."

this worthy clerk benignely answer'd;

philogenet was astonished at the crowd of people that
he saw, doing sacrifice to the god and goddess.
philobone informed him that they came from other
courts; those who knelt in blue wore the colour in
sign of their changeless truth <21>; those in black,
who uttered cries of grief, were the sick and dying of
love. the priests, nuns, hermits, and friars, and all that
sat in white, in russet and in green, "wailed of their
woe;" and for all people, of every degree, the court
was open and free. while he walked about with
philobone, a messenger from the king entered, and
summoned all the new-come folk to the royal
presence. trembling and pale, philogenet approached
the throne of admetus, and was sternly asked why he
came so late to court. he pleaded that a hundred
times he had been at the gate, but had been prevented
from entering by failure to s

this is the court of lusty folk and glad,
and well becomes their habit and array:
o why be some so sorry and so sad,
complaining thus in black and white and gray?
friars they be, and monkes, in good fay:
alas, for ruth! great dole* it is to see,                        *sorrow

desire man, and love in our degree,'
firm and faithful, right as would the queen:
our friendes wick', in tender youth and green,
against our will made us religious;
that is the cause we mourn and waile thus."

then said the monks and friars *in the tide,*         *at the same time*
"well may we curse our abbeys and our place,
our statutes sharp to sing in copes wide, <37>
chastely to keep us out of love's grace,
and never to feel comfort nor solace;*                          *delight
yet suffer we the heat of love's fire,
and after some other haply we desire.

38. tregetours: tricksters, jugglers. for explanation of this
word, see note 14 to the franklin's tale.

39. pythonesses:  women who, like the pythia in apollo's
temple at delphi, were possessed with a spirit of divination or
prophecy. the barbarous latin form of the word was
"pythonissa" or "phitonissa." see note 9 to the friar's tale.

spirits by burning incense; the practice of smoking cattle, corn,
