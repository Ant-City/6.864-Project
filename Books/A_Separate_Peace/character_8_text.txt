 as well as i did could realize that he was not changing the subject. i waited quietly for him to make whatever fantastic connection there might be between this and his shirt. well, weve got to do something to celebrate. we havent got a flag, we cant float old glory proudly out the window. so im going to wear this, as an emblem.he did wear it. no one else in the school could have done so without some risk of having it torn from his back. when the sternest of the summer sessions masters, old mr. patch-withers, came up to him after history class and asked about it, i watched his drawn but pink face become pinker with amusement as finny politely explained the meaning of the shirt.it was hypnotism. i was beginning to see that phineas could get away with anything. i couldnt help envying him that a little, which was perfectly normal. there was no harm in envying even your best friend a little.in the afternoon mr. patch-withers, who was substitute headmaster for the summer, offered the traditional term

tea to the upper middle class. it was held in the deserted headmasters house, and mr. patch-withers wife trembled at every cup tinkle. we were in a kind of sun porch and conservatory combined, spacious and damp and without many plants. those there were had large nonflowering stalks, with big barbaric leaves. the chocolate brown wicker furniture shot out menacing twigs, and three dozen of us stood tensely teetering our cups amid the wicker and leaves, trying hard not to sound as inane in our conversation with the four present masters and their wives as they sounded to us.phineas had soaked an

 phineas could not recall exactly what target in which country had been hit, or whether it was the american, british, or even russian air force which had hit it, or what day he read it in which newspaper, the discussion was one-sided.that didnt matter. it was the event which counted. but after a while finny felt he should carry the discussion to others. i think we ought to bomb the daylights out of them, as long as we dont hit any women or children or old people, dont you? he was saying to mrs. patch-withers, perched nervously behind her urn. or hospitals, he went on. and naturally no schools. or churches.we must also be careful about works of art, she put in, if they are of permanent value.a lot of nonsense, mr. patch-withers grumbled, with a flushed face. how do you expect our boys to be as precise as that thousands of feet up with bombs weighing tons! look at what the germans did to amsterdam! look at what they did to coventry!the germans arent the central europeans, dear, his wife said very

gently.he didnt like being brought up short. but he seemed to be just able to bear it, from his wife. after a temperamental pause he said gruffly, there isnt any permanent art in central europe anyway.finny was enjoying this. he unbuttoned his seersucker jacket, as though he needed greater body freedom for the discussion. mrs. patch-withers glance then happened to fall on his belt. in a tentative voice she said, isnt that the  our  her husband looked; i panicked. in his haste that morning finny had not unexpectedly used a tie for a belt. but this morning the first tie at hand had been the devon school tie.this time he wasnt going to get away with it. i could feel myself becoming unexpectedly excited at that. mr. patch-withers face was reaching a brilliant shade, and his wifes head fell as though before the guillotine. even finny

his, you see, because it goes with the shirt and it all ties in togetheri didnt mean that to be a pun, i dont think theyre very funny, especially in polite company, do you?it all ties in together with what weve been talking about, this bombing in central europe, because when you come right down to it the school is involved in everything that happens in the war, its all the same war and the same world, and i think devon ought to be included. i dont know whether you think the way i do on that.mr. patch-withers face had been shifting expressions and changing colors continuously, and now it settled into fixed surprise. i never heard anything so illogical as that in my life! he didnt sound very indignant, though. thats probably the strangest tribute this school has had in a hundred and sixty years. he seemed pleased or amused in some unknown corner of his mind. phineas was going to get away with even this.his eyes gave their wider, magical gleam and his voice continued on a more compelling level, altho

ugh i have to admit i didnt think of that when i put it on this morning. he smiled pleasantly after supplying this interesting additional information. mr. patch-withers settled into a hearty silence at this, and so finny added, im glad i put on something for a belt! i certainly would hate the embarrassment of having my pants fall down at the headmasters tea. of course he isnt here. but it would be just as embarrassing in front of you and mrs. patch-withers, and he smiled politely down at her.mr. patch-withers laughter surprised us all, including himself. his face, whose shades we had often labeled, now achieved a new one. phineas was very happy; sour and stern mr. patch-withers had been given a good laugh for once, and he had done it! he broke into the charmed, thoughtless grin of a man fulfilled.he had gotten away with everything. i felt a sudden stab of disappointment. that was because i just wanted to see some more excitement; that must have

hing alone, not when it was well enough, not when it was perfect. lets go jump in the river, he said under his breath as we went out of the sun porch. he forced compliance by leaning against me as we walked along, changing my direction; like a police car squeezing me to the side of the road, he directed me unwillingly toward the gym and the river. we need to clear our heads of that party, he said, all that talk!yes. it sure was boring. who did most of the talking anyway?finny concentrated. mr. patch-withers was pretty gassy, and his wife, and yeah. and?turning a look of mock shock on me, you dont mean to infer that i talked too much!returning, with interest, his gaping shock, you? talk too much? how can you accuse me of accusing you of that! as i said, this was my sarcastic summer. it was only long after that i recognized sarcasm as the protest of people who are weak.we walked along through the shining afternoon to the river. i dont really believe we bombed central europe, do you? said finny t

that accolade no one at devon could be anyone. no one, with the exception of course of phineas.to the left of the prize table brinker straddled his cache of cider; behind him was the clump of evergreens, and behind them there was after all a gentle rise, where the ski jump committee was pounding snow into a little take-off ramp whose lip was perhaps a foot higher than the slope of the rise. from there our line of snow statues, unrecognizable artistic attacks on the headmaster, mr. ludsbury, mr. patch-withers, dr. stanpole, the new dietitian, and hazel brewster curved in an enclosing half-circle to the icy, muddy, lisping edge of the tidewater naguamsett and back to the other side of the prize table.when the ski jump was ready there was a certain amount of milling around; twenty boys, tightly reined in all winter, stood now as though with the bit firmly clamped between their teeth, ready to stampede. phineas should have started the sports events but he was absorbed in cataloguing the prizes. all ey

 all it was.he was nodding his head, his jaw tightening and his eyes closed on the tears. i believe you. its okay because i understand and i believe you. youve already shown me and i believe you.the rest of the day passed quickly. dr. stanpole had told me in the corridor that he was going to set the bone that afternoon. come back around 5 oclock, he had said, when finny should be coming out of the anaesthesia.i left the infirmary and went to my 10:10 class, which was on american history. mr. patch-withers gave us a five-minute written quiz on the necessary and proper clause of the constitution. at 11 oclock i left that building and crossed the center common where a few students were already lounging although it was still a little early in the season for that. i went into the first building, walked up the stairs where finny had fallen, and joined my 11:10 class, which was in mathematics. we were given a ten-minute trigonometry problem which appeared to solve itself on my paper.at 12 i left the f
