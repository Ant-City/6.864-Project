ter of slender muscles in her arms.

when we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.

"to be continued," she said, tossing the magazine on the table, "in our very next issue."

her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.

"ten o'clock," she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. "time for this good girl to go to bed."

"jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow," explained daisy, "over at westchester."

"oh,--you're jordan baker."

i knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at asheville and hot springs and palm beach. i had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was i had forgotten long ago.

"good night," she said softly. "wake me at eight, won't you."

"if you'll get up."

"i will. good night, mr. carraway. see you anon."

"of course you will," confirmed daisy. "in fact i think i'll

 and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.

as soon as i arrived i made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom i asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that i slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.

i was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when jordan baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.

welcome or not, i found it necessary to attach myself to someone before i should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.

"hello!" i roared, advancing toward her. my voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.

"i thought you might be here," she responded absently as i came up. "i remembered you lived next door to----"

us contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing "stunts" all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. a pair of stage "twins"--who turned out to be the girls in yellow--did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls. the moon had risen higher, and floating in the sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.

i was still with jordan baker. we were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. i was enjoying myself now. i had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.

at a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.

"your face is familiar," he said, politely. "weren't you in the third division during the war?"

"why, yes. i was in the

 i'm having a good time he wants to go home."

"never heard anything so selfish in my life."

"we're always the first ones to leave."

"so are we."

"well, we're almost the last tonight," said one of the men sheepishly. "the orchestra left half an hour ago."

in spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted kicking into the night.

as i waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and jordan baker and gatsby came out together. he was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.

jordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.

"i've just heard the most amazing thing," she whispered. "how long were we in there?"

"why,--about an hour."

"it was--simply amazing," she repeated abstractedly. "but i swore i wouldn't tell it and here i a

ents of night and life.

again at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the forties were five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, i felt a sinking in my heart. forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. imagining that i, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, i wished them well.

for a while i lost sight of jordan baker, and then in midsummer i found her again. at first i was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and every one knew her name. then it was something more. i wasn't actually in love, but i felt a sort of tender curiosity. the bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something--most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don't in the beginning--and one day i found what it was. when we were on a house-party together up in warwick, she le

 lied about it--and suddenly i remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at daisy's. at her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. the thing approached the proportions of a scandal--then died away. a caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. the incident and the name had remained together in my mind.

jordan baker instinctively avoided clever shrewd men and now i saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. she was incurably dishonest. she wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this unwillingness i suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body.

it made no difference to me. dishonest

you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear."

so he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls.

"i'll tell you god's truth." his right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. "i am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west--all dead now. i was brought up in america but educated at oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. it is a family tradition."

he looked at me sideways--and i knew why jordan baker had believed he was lying. he hurried the phrase "educated at oxford," or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before. and with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and i wondered if there wasn't something a little sinister about him after all.

"what part of the middle-west?" i inquired casually.

"san francisco."

"i see."

"my family all died and i came into a good deal of money."

his voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still

n steps in our direction.

"where've you been?" he demanded eagerly. "daisy's furious because you haven't called up."

"this is mr. gatsby, mr. buchanan."

they shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over gatsby's face.

"how've you been, anyhow?" demanded tom of me. "how'd you happen to come up this far to eat?"

"i've been having lunch with mr. gatsby."

i turned toward mr. gatsby, but he was no longer there.


one october day in nineteen-seventeen---- (said jordan baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the plaza hotel) --i was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. i was happier on the lawns because i had on shoes from england with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. i had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-t

ere's something in that voice of hers. . . .

well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name gatsby for the first time in years. it was when i asked you--do you remember?--if you knew gatsby in west egg. after you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said "what gatsby?" and when i described him--i was half asleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. it wasn't until then that i connected this gatsby with the officer in her white car.


when jordan baker had finished telling all this we had left the plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through central park. the sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the west fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:

i'm the sheik of araby,
your love belongs to me.
at night when you're are asleep,
into your tent i'll creep----

"it was a strange coincidence," i said.

"but it wasn't a coincidenc

urtains had been moved aside a little and myrtle wilson was peering down at the car. so engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. her expression was curiously familiar--it was an expression i had often seen on women's faces but on myrtle wilson's face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until i realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on tom, but on jordan baker, whom she took to be his wife.


there is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. his wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking daisy and leaving wilson behind, and we sped along toward astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in si

uessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.

i thanked him for his hospitality. we were always thanking him for that--i and the others.

"goodbye," i called. "i enjoyed breakfast, gatsby."


up in the city i tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then i fell asleep in my swivel-chair. just before noon the phone woke me and i started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. it was jordan baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way. usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.

"i've left daisy's house," she said. "i'm at hempstead and i'm going down to southampton this afternoon."

probably it had been tactful to leave d

 one cares.

after gatsby's death the east was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes' power of correction. so when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line i decided to come back home.

there was one thing to be done before i left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. but i wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. i saw jordan baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair.

she was dressed to play golf and i remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. when i had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. i doubted that though there we
