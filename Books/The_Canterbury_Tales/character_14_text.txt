 in the statement that, after his
university career was completed, he entered the inner temple -
- the expenses of which could be borne only by men of noble
and opulent families; but although there is a story that he was
once fined two shillings for thrashing a franciscan friar in fleet
street, we have no direct authority for believing that the poet
devoted himself to the uncongenial study of the law. no special
display of knowledge on that subject appears in his works; yet
in the sketch of the manciple, in the prologue to the canterbury
tales, may be found indications of his familiarity with the
internal economy of the inns of court; while numerous legal
phrases and references hint that his comprehensive information
was not at fault on legal matters. leland says that he quitted the
university "a ready logician, a smooth rhetorician, a pleasant
poet, a grave philosopher, an ingenious mathematician, and a
holy divine;" and by all accounts, when geoffrey chaucer

47. the proverb says that every honest miller has a thumb of

half-past seven in the morning.

11. set his hove; like "set their caps;" as in the description of

notes to the epilogue to the nun's priest's tale


1.  the sixteen lines appended to the tale of the nun's priest
seem, as tyrwhitt observes, to commence the prologue to the
succeeding tale -- but the difficulty is to determine which that
tale should be. in earlier editions, the lines formed the opening
of the prologue to the manciple's tale; but most of the
manuscripts acknowledge themselves defective in this part, and
give the nun's tale after that of the nun's priest. in the harleian
manuscript, followed by mr wright, the second nun's tale, and
the canon's yeoman's tale, are placed after the franklin's tale;
and the sixteen lines above are not found -- the manciple's
prologue coming immediately after the "amen" of the nun's
priest. in two manuscripts, the last line of the sixteen runs thus:

notes to the prologue to the manciple's tale


1. bob-up-and-down: mr wright supposes this to be the village of
harbledown, near canterbury, which  is situated on a hill, and near
which there are many ups and downs in the road. like boughton,
where the canon and his yeoman overtook the pilgrims, it stood on
the skirts of the kentish forest of blean or blee.

2. dun is in the mire: a proverbial saying. "dun" is a name for an
ass, derived from his colour.

, "wine of sheep;" the melancholic, "wine of
sow." there is a rabbinical tradition that, when noah was planting
vines, satan slaughtered beside them the four animals named; hence
the effect of wine in making those who drink it display in turn the
characteristics of all the four.

6. the pose:  a defluxion or rheum which stops the nose and
obstructs the voice.

7. bring thee to his lure: a phrase in hawking -- to recall a hawk to
the fist; the meaning here is, that the cook may one day bring the
manciple to account, or pay him off, for the rebuke of his
drunkenness.

notes to the manciple's tale


1. "the fable of 'the crow,' says tyrwhitt, "which is the
subject of the manciple's tale, has been related by so many
authors, from ovid down to gower, that it is impossible to
say whom chaucer principally followed. his skill in new
dressing an old story was never, perhaps, more successfully
exerted."

2. see the parallel to this passage in the squire's tale, and
note 34 to that tale.

3. wantrust: distrust -- want of trust; so "wanhope," despair -
- want of hope.
