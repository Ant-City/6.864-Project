[CHARACTER] - 
                    	the
dark lord of mordor and creator of the one ring. while we never
encounter [CHARACTER] himself in the novel, the far-reaching effects
of the darkness of mordor suggest [CHARACTER]'s overwhelming presence
throughout middle-earth. [CHARACTER]'s great eye, which scans the land from
his home in the dark tower of barad-dur, acts as a manifestation
of his will. the destruction of the ring ultimately empties [CHARACTER]
of his power.
