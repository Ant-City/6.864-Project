[CHARACTER] - 
                when
something is an [CHARACTER] question, that means that the question
can only be settled by going out into the world and investigating.
the question, "what percentage of the population of the united states
likes ice cream" is an example of an [CHARACTER] question, which can
only be answered through [CHARACTER] investigation. the question "what
is the square root of two," on the other hand, is not an [CHARACTER]
question. in order to answer this question all you have to do is think
about the mathematics involved; you do not have investigate evidence
in the world.
