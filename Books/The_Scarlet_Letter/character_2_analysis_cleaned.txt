[CHARACTER]
as his name suggests, [CHARACTER] is a man deficient
in human warmth. his twisted, stooped, deformed shoulders mirror his
distorted soul. from what the reader is told of his early years with
hester, he was a difficult husband. he ignored his wife for much
of the time, yet expected her to nourish his soul with affection when
he did condescend to spend time with her. chillingworth's decision
to assume the identity of a "leech," or doctor, is fitting. unable
to engage in equitable relationships with those around him, he feeds
on the vitality of others as a way of energizing his own projects.
chillingworth's death is a result of the nature of his character.
after dimmesdale dies, chillingworth no longer has a victim. similarly,
dimmesdale's revelation that he is pearl's father removes hester
from the old man's clutches. having lost the objects of his revenge,
the leech has no choice but to die.
ultimately, chillingworth represents true evil. he is
associated with secular and sometimes illicit forms of knowledge,
as his chemical experiments and medical practices occasionally verge
on witchcraft and murder. he is interested in revenge, not justice,
and he seeks the deliberate destruction of others rather than a
redress of wrongs. his desire to hurt others stands in contrast
to hester and dimmesdale's sin, which had love, not hate, as its
intent. any harm that may have come from the young lovers' deed
was unanticipated and inadvertent, whereas chillingworth reaps deliberate
harm.
