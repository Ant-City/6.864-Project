er-tribal wars. and so
although okonkwo was still young, he was already one of the
greatest men of his time. age was respected among his people, but
achievement was revered. as the elders said, if a child washed his
hands he could eat with kings. okonkwo had clearly washed his



hands and so he ate with kings and elders. and that was how he
came to look after the doomed lad who was sacrificed to the
village of umuofia by their neighbors to avoid war and bloodshed.
the ill-fated lad was called ikemefuna.



chapter two

okonkwo had just blown out the palm-oil lamp and stretched
himself on his bamboo bed when he heard the ogene of the town
crier piercing the still night air. gome, gome, gome, gome, boomed
the hollow metal. then the crier gave his message, and at the end
of it beat his instrument again. and this was the message. every
man of umuofia was asked to gather at the market place tomorrow
morning. okonkwo wondered what was amiss, for he knew
certainly that something was amiss. he had di

fia to wage a war. if the clan had disobeyed
the oracle they would surely have been beaten, because their
dreaded agadi-nwayi would never fight what the ibo call a fight of
blame.

but the war that now threatened was a just war. even the enemy
clan knew that. and so when okonkwo of umuofia arrived at
mbaino as the proud and imperious emissary of war, he was




treated with great honor and respect, and two days later he returned
home with a lad of fifteen and a young virgin. the lad's name was
ikemefuna, whose sad story is still told in umuofia unto this day.

the elders, or ndichie, met to hear a report of okonkwo's mission.
at the end they decided, as everybody knew they would, that the
girl should go to ogbuefi udo to replace his murdered wife. as for
the boy, he belonged to the clan as a whole, and there was no hurry
to decide his fate. okonkwo was, therefore, asked on behalf of the
clan to look after him in the interim. and so for three years
ikemefuna lived in okonkwo's household.

ously in it. at the
opposite end of the compound was a shed for the goats, and each
wife built a small attachment to her hut for the hens. near the barn
was a small house, the "medicine house" or shrine where okonkwo
kept the wooden symbols of his personal god and of his ancestral
spirits. he worshipped them with sacrifices of kola nut, food and
palm-wine, and offered prayers to them on behalf of himself, his
three wives and eight children.

so when the daughter of umuofia was killed in mbaino,
ikemefuna came into okonkwo's household. when okonkwo
brought him home that day he called his most senior wife and
handed him over to her.

"he belongs to the clan," he told her. "so look after him."

"is he staying long with us?" she asked.

"do what you are told, woman," okonkwo thundered, and
stammered. "when did you become one of the ndichie of
umuofia?"

and so nwoye's mother took ikemefuna to her hut and asked no
more questions.





as for the boy himself, he was terribly afraid. he could not

onkwo said yes very strongly, so his
chi agreed. and not only his chi but his clan too, because it judged
a man by the work or his hands. that was why okonkwo had been
chosen by the nine villages to carry a message of war to their
enemies unless they agreed to give up a young man and a virgin to
atone for the murder of udo's wife. and such was the deep fear
that their enemies had for umuofia that they treated okonkwo like
a king and brought him a virgin who was given to udo as wife, and
the lad ikemefuna.

the elders of the clan had decided that ikemefuna should be in
okonkwo's care for a while. but no one thought it would be as
long as three years. they seemed to forget all about him as soon as
they had taken the decision.

at first ikemefuna was very much afraid. once or twice he tried to
run away, but he did not know where to begin. he thought of his
mother and his three-year-old sister and wept bitterly. nwoye's
mother was very kind to him and treated him as one of her own
children. but all

elephant grass. he knew the names of all the birds and could set



clever traps for the little bush rodents. and he knew which trees
made the strongest bows.



even okonkwo himself became very fond of the boy - inwardly of
course. okonkwo never showed any emotion openly, unless it be
the emotion of anger. to show affection was a sign of weakness,-
the only thing worth demonstrating was strength. he therefore
treated ikemefuna as he treated everybody else - with a heavy hand.
but there was no doubt that he liked the boy. sometimes when he
went to big village meetings or communal ancestral feasts he
allowed ikemefuna to accompany him, like a son, carrying his
stool and his goatskin bag. and, indeed, ikemefuna called him
father.

ikemefuna came to umuofia at the end of the carefree season
between harvest and planting. in fact he recovered from his illness
only a few days before the week of peace began. and that was

the smoke rose into the sky kites appeared
from different directions and hovered over the burning field in
silent valediction. the rainy season was approaching when they
would go away until the dry season returned.

okonkwo spent the next few days preparing his seed-yams. he
looked at each yam carefully to see whether it was good for sowing.
sometimes he decided that a yam was too big to be sown as one
seed and he split it deftly along its length with his sharp knife. his
eldest son, nwoye, and ikemefuna helped him by fetching the
yams in long baskets from the barn and in counting the prepared
seeds in groups of four hundred. sometimes okonkwo gave them a
few yams each to prepare. but he always found fault with their
effort, and he said so with much threatening.



"do you think you are cutting up yams for cooking?" he asked
nwoye. "if you split another yam of this size, i shall break your
jaw. you think you are still a child. i began to own a farm at your
age. and you," he said to ikemefuna,

y seemed merged in one gray wetness. it was then
uncertain whether the low rumbling of amadiora's thunder came
from above or below. at such times, in each of the countless
thatched huts of umuofia, children sat around their mother's
cooking fire telling stories, or with their father in his obi warming
themselves from a log fire, roasting and eating maize. it was a brief
resting period between the exacting and arduous planting season
and the equally exacting but light-hearted month of harvests.

ikemefuna had begun to feel like a member of okonkwo's family.
he still thought about his mother and his three-year-old sister, and
he had moments of sadness and depression but he and nwoye had
become so deeply attached to each other that such moments
became less frequent and less poignant. ikemefuna had an endless
stock of folk tales. even those which nwoye knew already were
told with a new freshness and the local flavor of a different clan.
nwoye remembered this period very vividly till the end of his

life.
he even remembered how he had laughed when ikemefuna told
him that the proper name for a corn cob with only a few scattered
grains was eze-agadi-nwayi, or the teeth of an old woman.
nwoye's mind had gone immediately to nwayieke, who lived near
the udala tree. she had about three teeth and was always smoking
her pipe.




gradually the rains became lighter and less frequent, and earth and
sky once again became separate. the rain fell in thin, slanting
showers through sunshine and quiet breeze. children no longer
stayed indoors but ran about singi

"the rain is falling, the sun is shining, alone nnadi is cooking and

nwoye always wondered who nnadi was and why he should live
all by himself, cooking and eating. in the end he decided that
nnadi must live in that land of ikemefuna's favorite story where
the ant holds his court in splendor and the sands dance forever.

chapter five

the feast of the new yam was approaching and umuofia was in a
festival mood. it was an occasion for giving thanks to ani, the
earth goddess and the source of all fertility. ani played a greater
part in the life of the people than any other diety. she was the
ultimate judge of morality and conduct. and what was more, she
was in close communion with the departed fathers of the clan
whose bodies

light. they had then drawn patterns on them in white, yellow and
dark green. they then set about painting themselves with cam
wood and drawing beautiful black patterns on their stomachs and
on their backs. the children were also decorated, especially their
hair, which was shaved in beautiful patterns. the three women
talked excitedly about the relations who had been invited, and the
children reveled in the thought of being spoiled by these visitors
from the motherland. ikemefuna was equally excited. the new
yam festival seemed to him to be a much bigger event here than
in his own village, a place which was already becoming remote
and vague in his imagination.



and then the storm burst. okonkwo, who had been walking about
aimlessly in his compound in suppressed anger, suddenly found an
outlet.



"who killed this banana tree?" he asked.

a hush fell on the compound immediately.

"who killed this tree? or are you all deaf and dumb?"

as a matter of fact the tree was v

of the other wives dared to interfere beyond an occasional and
tentative, "it is enough, okonkwo," pleaded from a reasonable
distance.

his anger thus satisfied, okonkwo decided to go out hunting. he
had an old rusty gun made by a clever blacksmith who had come to
live in umuofta long ago. but although okonkwo was a great man
whose prowess was universally acknowledged, he was not a hunter.
in fact he had not killed a rat with his gun. and so when he called
ikemefuna to fetch his gun, the wife who had just been beaten
murmured something about guns that never shot. unfortunately for
her okonkwo heard it and ran madly into his room for the loaded
gun, ran out again and aimed at her as she clambered over the
dwarf wall of the barn. he pressed the trigger and there was a loud
report accompanied by the wail of his wives and children. he
threw down the gun and jumped into the barn and there lay the
woman, very much shaken and frightened but quite unhurt. he

ied to pull out the
horny beak but it was too hard. she turned round on her low stool
and put the beak in the fire for a few moments. she pulled again
and it came off.

"ekwefi!" a voice called from one of the other huts. it was
nwoye's mother, okonkwo's first wife.



"is that me?" ekwefi called back. that was the way people
answered calls from outside. they never answered yes for fear it
might be an evil spirit calling.



"will you give ezinma some fire to bring to me?" her own
children and ikemefuna had gone to the stream.

ekwefi put a few live coals into a piece of broken pot and ezinma
carried it across the clean swept compound to nwoye's mother.

"thank you, nma," she said. she was peeling new yams, and in a
basket beside her were green vegetables and beans.

"let me make the fire for you," ezinma offered.

"thank you, ezigbo," she said. she often called her ezigbo, which
means "the good one."

ezinma went outside and brought some sticks from a huge bundle
of firewood. she broke them i

ings. she cut the yams into small
pieces and began to prepare a pottage, using some of the chicken.

at that moment they heard someone crying just outside their
compound. it was very much like obiageli, nwoye's sister.

"is that not obiageli weeping?" ekwefi called across the yard to
nwoye's mother.



"yes," she replied. "she must have broken her waterpot."



the weeping was now quite close and soon the children filed in,
carrying on their heads various sizes of pots suitable to their years.
ikemefuna came first with the biggest pot, closely followed by
nwoye and his two younger brothers. obiageli brought up the rear,
her face streaming with tears. in her hand was the cloth pad on
which the pot should have rested on her head.

"what happened?" her mother asked, and obiageli told her
mournful story. her mother consoled her and promised to buy her
her another pot.

nwoye's younger brothers were about to tell their mother the true
story of the accident when ikemefuna looked at them sternly and

swung it over his rival's head. the crowd burst into a thunderous
roar. okafo was swept off his feet by his supporters and carried
home shoulder high. they sang his praise and the young women
clapped their hands:

"who will wrestle for our village?



okafo will wrestle for our village. has he thrown a hundred men?



he has thrown four hundred men. has he thrown a hundred cats?

he has thrown four hundred cats. then send him word to fight  for
us."

chapter seven

for three years ikemefuna lived in okonkwo's household and the
elders of umuofia seemed to have forgotten about him. he grew
rapidly like a yam tendril in the rainy season, and was full of the
sap of life. he had become wholly absorbed into his new family.
he was like an elder brother to nwoye, and from the very first
seemed to have kindled a new fire in the younger boy. he made
him feel grown-up, and they no longer spent the evenings in his
mother's hut while she cooked, but now sat with okonkwo in his
obi, or watched 
 
 ___________________________
 
him as he tapped his palm tree for the evening
wine. nothing pleased nwoye now more than to be sent for by his
mother or another of his father's wives to do one of those difficult
and masculine tasks in the home, like splitting wood, or pounding
food. on receiving such a message through a younger brother or
sister, nwoye would feign annoyance and grumble aloud about
women and their troubles.

okonkwo was inwardly pleased at his son's development, and he
knew it was due to ikemefuna. he wanted nwoye to grow into a
tough young man capable of ruling his father's household when he
was dead and gone to join the ancestors.

he wanted him to be a prosperous man, having enough in his barn
to feed the ancestors with regular sacrifices. and so he was always
happy when he heard him grumbling about women. that showed
that in time he would be able to control his women-folk. no matter
how prosperous a man was, if he was unable to rule his women and
his children (and especially his wome

o a
distant land, from where he had espied a fire. and when he got
there he found it was a man making a sacrifice. he warmed
himself in the fire and ate the entrails.

that was the kind of story that nwoye loved. but he now knew
that they were for foolish women and children, and he knew that
his father wanted him to be a man. and so he feigned that he no
longer cared for women's stories. and when he did this he saw that
his father was pleased, and no longer rebuked him or beat him. so
nwoye and ikemefuna would listen to okonkwo's stories about
tribal wars, or how, years ago, he had stalked his victim,



overpowered him and obtained his first human head. and as he
told them of the past they sat in darkness or the dim glow of logs,
waiting for the women to finish their cooking. when they finished,
each brought her bowl of foo-foo and bowl of soup to her husband.
an oil lamp was lit and okonkwo tasted from each bowl, and then
passed two shares to nwoye and ikemefuna.



in this way the moons and

hem, but the
elders counseled patience till nightfall. and they were right. the
locusts settled in the bushes for the night and their wings became



wet with dew. then all umuofia turned out in spite of the cold
harmattan, and everyone filled his bags and pots with locusts. the
next morning they were roasted in clay pots and then spread in the
sun until they became dry and brittle. and for many days this rare
food was eaten with solid palm-oil.



okonkwo sat in his obi crunching happily with ikemefuna and
nwoye, and drinking palm-wine copiously, when ogbuefi ezeudu
came in. ezeudu was the oldest man in this quarter of umuofia. he
had been a great and fearless warrior in his time, and was now
accorded great respect in all the clan. he refused to join in the meal,
and asked okonkwo to have a word with him outside. and so they
walked out together, the old man supporting himself with his stick.
when they were out of earshot, he said to okonkwo:

"that boy calls you father. do not bear a hand in 
 
 ___________________________
 
ath."
okonkwo was surprised, and was about to say something when the
old man continued:

"yes, umuofia has decided to kill him. the oracle of the hills and
the caves has pronounced it. they will take him outside umuofia
as is the custom, and kill him there. but i want you to have nothing
to do with it. he calls you his father."

the next day a group of elders from all the nine villages of
umuofia came to okonkwo's house early in the morning, and
before they began to speak in low tones nwoye and ikemefuna
were sent out. they did not stay very long, but when they went
away okonkwo sat still for a very long time supporting his chin in
his palms. later in the day he called ikemefuna and told him that
he was to be taken home the next day. nwoye overheard it and
burst into tears, whereupon his father beat him heavily. as for
ikemefuna, he was at a loss. his own home had gradually become
very faint and distant. he still missed his mother and his sister and
would be very glad to see them. but somehow h

e knew he was not



going to see them. he remembered once when men had talked in
low tones with his father, and it seemed now as if it was happening
all over again.



later, nwoye went to his mother's hut and told her that ikemefuna
was going home. she immediately dropped her pestle with which
she was grinding pepper, folded her arms across her breast and
sighed, "poor child."

the next day, the men returned with a pot of wine. they were all
fully dressed as if they were going to a big clan meeting or to pay a
visit to a neighboring village. they passed their cloths under the
right arm-pit, and hung their goatskin bags and sheathed machetes
over their left shoulders. okonkwo got ready quickly and the party
set out with ike

music and dancing and a great feast.



the footway had now become a narrow line in the heart of the
forest. the short trees and sparse undergrowth which surrounded
the men's village began to give way to giant trees and climbers
which perhaps had stood from the beginning of things, untouched
by the ax and the bush-fire. the sun breaking through their leaves
and branches threw a pattern of light and shade on the sandy
footway.

ikemefuna heard a whisper close behind him and turned round
sharply. the man who had whispered now called out aloud, urging
the others to hurry up.

"we still have a long way to go," he said. then he and another man
went before ikemefuna and set a faster pace.

thus the men of umuofia pursued their way, armed with sheathed
machetes, and ikemefuna, carrying a pot of palm-wine on his head,
walked in their midst. although he had felt uneasy at first, he was
not afraid now. okonkwo walked behind him. he coul

he sang it in his mind, and walked to its beat. if the song ended on
his right foot, his mother was alive. if it ended on his left, she was
dead. no, not dead, but ill. it ended on the right. she was alive and
well. he sang the song again, and it ended on the left. but the
second time did not count. the first voice gets to chukwu, or
god's house. that was a favorite saying of children. ikemefuna felt
like a child once more. it must be the thought of going home to his
mother.

one of the men behind him cleared his throat. ikemefuna looked
back, and the man growled at him to go on and not stand looking
back. the way he said it sent cold fear down ikemefuna's back. his
hands trembled vaguely on the black pot he carried. why had
okonkwo withdrawn to the rear? ikemefuna felt his legs melting
under him. and he was afraid to look back.

as the man who had cleared his throat drew up and raised
 
 ___________________________
 
 his
machete, okonkwo looked away. he heard the blow. the pot fell
and broke in the sand. he heard ikemefuna cry, "my father, they
have killed me!" as he ran towards him. dazed with fear, okonkwo
drew his machete and cut him down. he was afraid of being
thought weak.





as soon as his father walked in, that night, nwoye knew that
ikemefuna had been killed, and something seemed to give way
inside him, like the snapping of a tightened bow. he did not cry.
he just hung limp. he had had the same kind of feeling not long
ago, during the last harvest season. every child loved the harvest
season. those who were big enough to carry even a few yams in a
tiny basket went with grown-ups to the farm. and if they could not
help in digging up the yams, they could gather firewood together
for roasting the ones that would be eaten there on the f

est. a
sudden hush had fallen on the women, who had been talking, and
they had quickened their steps. nwoye had heard that twins were
put in earthenware pots and thrown away in the forest, but he had
never yet come across them. a vague chill had descended on him
and his head had seemed to swell, like a solitary walker at night
who passes an evil spirit an the way. then something had given
way inside him. it descended on him again, this feeling, when his
father walked in that night after killing ikemefuna.

chapter eight

okonkwo did not taste any food for two days after the death of
ikemefuna. he drank palm-wine from morning till night, and his
eyes were red and fierce like the eyes of a rat when it was caught
by the tail and dashed against the floor. he called his son, nwoye,
to sit with him in his obi. but the boy was afraid of him and
slipped out of the hut as soon as he noticed him dozing.

he did not sleep at night. he tried not to think about ikemefuna,-
but the more he tried the more he

nuff-bottle he tapped it a few times against his knee-cap
before taking out some snuff on the palm of his left hand. then he
remembered that he had not taken out his snuff-spoon. he searched
his bag again and brought out a small, flat, ivory spoon, with
which he carried the brown snuff to his nostrils.

ezinma took the dish in one hand and the empty water bowl in the
other and went back to her mother's hut. "she should have been a





boy," okonkwo said to himself again. his mind went back to
ikemefuna and he shivered. if only he could find some work to do
he would be able to forget. but it was the season of rest between
the harvest and the next planting season. the only work that men
did at this time was covering the walls of their compound with new
palm fronds. and okonkwo had already done that. he had finished
it on the very day the locusts came, when he had worked on one
side of the wall and ikemefuna and nwoye on the other.

"when did you become a shivering old woman," okonkwo asked

said obierika. "i remember when i was a young boy there was a
song about them. he could not do anything without telling her."

"i did not know that," said okonkwo. "i thought he was a strong
man in his youth."

"he was indeed," said ofoedu.

okonkwo shook his head doubtfully.



"he led umuofia to war in those days," said obierika.



okonkwo was beginning to feel like his old self again. all that he
required was something to occupy his mind. if he had killed
ikemefuna during the busy planting season or harvesting it would
not have been so bad, his mind would have been centered on his
work. okonkwo was not a man of thought but of action. but in
absence of work, talking was the next best.

soon after ofoedu left, okonkwo took up his goatskin bag to go.

"i must go home to tap my palm trees for the afternoon," he said.

"who taps your tall trees for you?" asked obierika.

"umezulike," replied okonkwo.

"sometimes i wish i had not taken the ozo title," said obie

but there was a young lad who had been captivated. his name was
nwoye, okonkwo's first son. it was not the mad logic of the
trinity that captivated him. he did not understand it. it was the
poetry of the new religion, something felt in the marrow. the
hymn about brothers who sat in darkness and in fear seemed to
answer a vague and persistent question that haunted his young
soul—the question of the twins crying in the bush and the question
of ikemefuna who was killed. he lelt a relief within as the hymn
poured into his parched soul. the words of the hymn were like the
drops of frozen rain melting on the dry palate of the panting earth.
nwoye's callow mind was greatly puzzled.

chapter seventeen

villagers told them that there was no king. "we have men
