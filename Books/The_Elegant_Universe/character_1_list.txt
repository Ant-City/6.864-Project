Max Born (1882-1970) - 
A German physicist. In 1926, Born introduced one
of the most bizarre--but still experimentally verifiable--aspects
of quantum theory: the idea that an electron wave must be interpreted
from the standpoint of probability. Born's reinterpretation of Schrodinger's
wave equation led to a new theory of quantum mechanics.
