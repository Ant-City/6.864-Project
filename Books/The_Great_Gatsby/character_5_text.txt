 i can tell you. god, how i hated that town!"

the late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the mediterranean--then the shrill voice of mrs. mckee called me back into the room.

"i almost made a mistake, too," she declared vigorously. "i almost married a little kyke who'd been after me for years. i knew he was below me. everybody kept saying to me: 'lucille, that man's way below you!' but if i hadn't met chester, he'd of got me sure."

"yes, but listen," said myrtle wilson, nodding her head up and down, "at least you didn't marry him."

"i know i didn't."

"well, i married him," said myrtle, ambiguously. "and that's the difference between your case and mine."

"why did you, myrtle?" demanded catherine. "nobody forced you to."

myrtle considered.

"i married him because i thought he was a gentleman," she said finally. "i thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick my shoe."

"you were crazy about him for a while," said catherine.

"crazy ab

ar," said tom. "i'll send it over tomorrow afternoon."

that locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now i turned my head as though i had been warned of something behind. over the ashheaps the giant eyes of doctor t. j. eckleburg kept their vigil but i perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.

in one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and myrtle wilson was peering down at the car. so engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. her expression was curiously familiar--it was an expression i had often seen on women's faces but on myrtle wilson's face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until i realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on tom, but on jordan baker, whom she took to be his wife.

shed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.

the "death car" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend. michaelis wasn't even sure of its color--he told the first policeman that it was light green. the other car, the one going toward new york, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where myrtle wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark blood with the dust.

michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. the mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.


we saw the three or

 said tom excitedly.

he reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead. then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.

the circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before i could see anything at all. then new arrivals disarranged the line and jordan and i were pushed suddenly inside.

myrtle wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a work table by the wall and tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. at first i couldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage--then i saw wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying

ime-table i drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. then i leaned back in my chair and tried to think. it was just noon.


when i passed the ashheaps on the train that morning i had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. i suppose there'd be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and myrtle wilson's tragic achievement was forgotten. now i want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before.

they had difficulty in locating the sister, catherine. she must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to flushing. when they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. someone kind o
