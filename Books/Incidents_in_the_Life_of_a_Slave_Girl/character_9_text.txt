        at that time, my grandmother was just fifty years old. laborious years had passed since then; and now my brother and i were slaves to the man who had defrauded her of her money, and tried to defraud her of her freedom. one of my mother's sisters, called aunt nancy, was also a slave in his family. she was a kind, good aunt to me; and supplied the

place of both housekeeper and waiting maid to her mistress. she was, in fact, at the beginning and end of every thing.

        mrs. flint, like many southern women, was totally deficient in energy. she had not strength to superintend her household affairs; but her nerves were so strong, that she could sit in her easy chair and see a woman whipped, till the blood trickled from every stroke of the lash. s

ed the trader; "our bargain is closed." he had, in fact, already sold them to mr. sands, but he did not mention it. the doctor required him to put irons on "that rascal, bill," and to pass through the back streets when he took his gang out of town. the trader was privately instructed to concede to his wishes. my good old aunt went to jail to bid the children good by, supposing them to be the speculator's property, and that she should never see them again. as she held benny in her lap, he said, "aunt nancy, i want to show you something." he led her to the door and showed her a long row of marks, saying "uncle will taught me to count. i have made a mark for every day i have been here, and it is sixty days. it is a long time; and the speculator is going to take me and ellen away. he's a bad man. it's

        it was a long time since i had taken a walk out of doors, and the fresh air revived me. it was also pleasant to hear a human voice speaking to me above a whisper. i passed several people whom i knew, but they did not recognize me in my disguise. i prayed internally that, for peter's sake, as well as my own, nothing might occur to bring out his dagger. we walked on till we came to the wharf. my aunt nancy's husband was a seafaring man, and it had been deemed necessary to let him into our secret. he took me into his boat, rowed out to a vessel not far distant, and hoisted me on board. we three were the only occupants of the vessel. i now ventured to ask what they proposed to do with me. they said i was to remain on board till near dawn, and then they would hide me in snaky swamp, till my uncle phillip had prepared a place of concealment for me. if the vessel had been bound north, it would have be

        my food was passed up to me through the trap-door my uncle had contrived; and my grandmother, my uncle phillip, and aunt nancy would seize such opportunities as they could, to mount up there and chat with me at the opening. but of course this was not safe in the daytime. it must all be done in darkness. it was impossible for me to move in an erect position, but i crawled about my den for exercise. one day i hit my head against something, and found it was a gimlet.

or weeks i was tormented by hundreds of little red insects, fine as a needle's point, that pierced through my skin, and produced an intolerable burning. the good grandmother gave me herb teas and cooling medicines, and finally i got rid of them. the heat of my den was intense, for nothing but thin shingles protected me from the scorching summer's sun. but i had my consolations. through my peeping-hole i could watch the children, and when they were near enough, i could hear their talk.

aunt nancy brought me all the news she could hear at dr. flint's. from her i learned that the doctor had written to new york to a colored woman, who had been born and raised in our neighborhood, and had breathed his contaminating atmosphere. he offered her a reward if she could find out any thing about me. i know not what was the nature of her reply; but he soon after started for new york in haste, saying to his family that he had business of importance to transact. i peeped at him as he passed on his way

        when my grandmother's illness became known, many ladies, who were her customers, called to bring her some little comforts, and to inquire whether she had every thing she wanted. aunt nancy one night asked permission to watch with her sick mother, and mrs. flint replied, "i don't see any need of your going. i can't spare you." but when she found other ladies in the neighborhood were so attentive, not wishing to be outdone in christian charity, she also sallied forth, in magnificent condescension, and stood by the bedside of her who had loved her in her infancy, and who had been repaid by such grievous wrongs. she seemed surprised to find her so ill, and scolded uncle phillip for n

        it was necessary to tell my grandmother what i had done, in order that she might be ready for the letter, and prepared to hear what dr. flint might say about my being at the north. she was sadly troubled.

she felt sure mischief would come of it. i also told my plan to aunt nancy, in order that she might report to us what was said at dr. flint's house. i whispered it to her through a crack, and she whispered back, "i hope it will succeed. i shan't mind being a slave all my life, if i can only see you and the children free."

        i had directed that my letters should be put into the new york post office on the 20th of the month. on that evening of the 24th my aunt came to say that dr. flint and his wife had been talking in a low voice about a letter he had received,

ed to put away from me the painful thought that such a foul wrong could have been done to us. i said to myself, "surely there must be some justice in man;" then i remembered, with a sigh, how slavery perverted all the natural feelings of the human heart. it gave me a pang to look on my light-hearted boy. he believed himself free; and to have him brought under the yoke of slavery, would be more than i could bear. how i longed to have him safely out of the reach of its power!

aunt nancy.

        i have mentioned my great-aunt, who was a slave in dr. flint's family, and who had been my refuge during the shameful persecutions i suffered from him. this aunt had been married at twenty years of age; that is, as far as slaves can marry. she had the consent of her master and mistress, and a clergyman performed the ceremony. but it was a mere form, without any legal value. her master or mistress could annul it any day they pleased. she had always slept on the floor in the entry, near

e a servant by death, now induced them to allow her to sleep in her little room in the out-house, except when there was sickness in the family. she afterwards had two feeble babes, one of whom died in a few days, and the other in four weeks. i well remember her patient sorrow as she held the last dead baby in her arms. "i wish it could have lived," she said; "it is not the will of god that any of my children should live. but i will try to be fit to meet their little spirits in heaven."

        aunt nancy was housekeeper and waiting-maid in dr. flint's family. indeed, she was the factotum of the household. nothing went on well without her. she was my mother's twin sister, and, as far as was in her power, she supplied a mother's place to us orphans. i slept with her all the time i lived in my old master's house, and the bond between us was very strong. when my friends tried to discourage me from running away, she always encouraged me. when they thought i had better return and ask my master's pard

mother, who was kneeling by her side. his eyes moistened for a moment, as he said she had always been a faithful servant, and they should never be able to supply her place. mrs. flint took to her bed, quite overcome by the shock. while my grandmother sat alone with the dead, the doctor came in, leading his youngest son, who had always been a great pet with aunt nancy, and was much attached to her. "martha," said he, "aunt nancy loved this child, and when he comes where you are, i hope you will be kind to him, for her sake." she replied, "your wife was my foster-child, dr. flint, the foster-sister of my poor nancy, and you little know me if you think i can feel any thing but good will for her children."

        "i wish the past could be forgotten, and that we might never think of it," said he; "and that linda would come to supply her aunt's place. she would

        mrs. flint had rendered her poor foster-sister childless, apparently without any compunction; and with cruel selfishness had ruined her health by years of incessant, unrequited toil, and broken rest. but now she became very sentimental. i suppose she thought it would be a beautiful illustration of the attachment existing between slaveholder and slave, if the body of her old worn-out servant was buried at her feet. she sent for the clergyman and asked if he had any objection to burying aunt nancy in the doctor's family burial place. no colored person had ever been allowed interment in the white people's burying-ground, and the minister knew that all the deceased of our family reposed together in the old graveyard of the slaves. he therefore replied, "i have no objection to complying with your wish; but perhaps aunt nancy's mother may have some choice as to where her remains shall be deposited."

 sometimes imparted to my grandmother, when she came to whisper with me at the trap-door. the kind-hearted old woman had an intense sympathy for runaways. she had known too much of the cruelties inflicted on those who were captured. her memory always flew back at once to the sufferings of her bright and handsome son, benjamin, the youngest and dearest of her flock. so, whenever i alluded to the subject, she would groan out, "o, don't think of it, child. you'll break my heart." i had no good old aunt nancy now to encourage me; but my brother william and my children were continually beckoning me to the north.

        and now i must go back a few months in my story. i have stated that the first of january was the time for selling slaves, or leasing them out to new masters. if time were counted by heart-throbs, the poor slaves

and her house would be torn down. poor peter! if he should die such a horrible death as the poor slave james had lately done, and all for his kindness in trying to help me, how dreadful it would be for us all! alas, the thought was familiar to me, and had sent many a sharp pang through my heart. i tried to suppress my own anxiety, and speak soothingly to her. she brought in some allusion to aunt nancy, the dear daughter she had recently buried, and then she lost all control of herself. as she stood there, trembling and sobbing, a voice from the piazza called out, "whar is you, aunt marthy?" grandmother was startled, and in her agitation opened the door, without thinking of me. in stepped jenny, the mischievous housemaid, who had tried to enter my room, when i was concealed in the house of my white benefactress. "i's bin huntin ebery whar for you, aunt marthy," said she. "my missis wants you

ly, which purported to be written by her younger brother. in order rightly to enjoy the contents of this letter, the reader must bear in mind that the flint family supposed i had been at the north many years. they had no idea that i knew of the doctor's three excursions to new york in search of me; that i had heard his voice, when he came to borrow five hundred dollars for that purpose; and that i had seen him pass on his way to the steamboat. neither were they aware that all the particulars of aunt nancy's death and burial were conveyed to me at the time they occurred. i have kept the letter, of which i herewith subjoin a copy:—
        "your letter to sister was received a few days ago. i gather from it that you are desirous of returning to your native place, among your friends and relatives. we were all gratified with the contents of your letter; and let me assure you that if any members of the family have had any feeling of resentment towards you, they feel it no longer. we all sympathize
