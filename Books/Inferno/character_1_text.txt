first annexed to the world of romance.[128] for hours of relaxation,
when they came, he had neighbours who dabbled in letters and who could
at any rate sympathise with him in his love of study. he maintained
correspondence with poets and scholars in other cities. in at least one
instance this was conducted in the bitter fashion with which the
humanists of a century or two later were to make the world
familiar;[129] but with the bolognese scholar, giovanni del virgilio, he
engaged in a good-humoured, half-bantering exchange of latin pastoral
poems, through the artificial imagery of which there sometimes breaks a
natural thought, as when in answer to the pedant's counsel to renounce
the vulgar tongue and produce in latin something that will entitle him
to receive the laurel crown in bologna, he declares that if ever he is
crowned as a poet it will be on the banks of the arno.

x. 31.

[27] _inf._ x. 42. though dante was descended from nobles, his rank in
florence was not that of a noble or magnate, but of a commoner.

[28] the month is indicated by dante himself, _parad._ xxii. 110. the
year has recently been disputed. for 1265 we have j. villani and the
earliest biographers; and dante's own expression at the beginning of the
_comedy_ is in favour of it.

[30] _inf._ xix. 17; _parad._ xxv. 9.

[31] _purg._ xxx. 55.

[32] _inf._ viii. 45, where virgil says of dante that blessed was she
that bore him, can scarcely be regarded as an exception to this
statement.

[33] in 1326, out of a population of ninety thousand, from eight to ten
thousand children were being taught to read; and from five to six
hundred were being taught grammar and logic in four high schools. there
was not in dante's time, or till much later, a university in florence.

weak as a poet as when he is most the philosopher or the theologian.
the following list of books more or less known to him is not given as
complete:--the vulgate, beginning with st. jerome's prologue; aristotle,
through the latin translation then in vogue; averroes, etc.; thomas
aquinas and the other schoolmen; much of the civil and canon law;
boethius; homer only in scraps, through aristotle, etc.; virgil, cicero
in part, livy, horace, ovid, terence, lucan, and statius; the works of
brunetto latini; the poetical literature of provence, france, and italy,
including the arthurian romances--the favourite reading of the italian
nobles, and the tales of charlemagne and his peers--equally in favour
with the common people. there is little reason to suppose that among the
treatises of a scientific and quasi-scientific kind that he fell in
with, and of which he was an eager student, were included the wor

o all that is good.

[169] _a she-wolf_: used elsewhere in the _comedy_ to represent avarice.
dante may have had specially in his mind the greed and worldly ambition
of the pope and the court of rome, but it is plain from line 110 that
the wolf stands primarily for a sin, and not for a person or corporate
body.

[170] _no man_: brunetto latini, the friend and master of dante, says
'the soul is the life of man, but without the body is not man.'

[171] _sub julio_: julius was not even consul when virgil was born. but
dante reckoned julius as the founder of the empire, and therefore makes
the time in which he flourished his. virgil was only twenty-five years
of age when cæsar was slain; and thus it was under augustus that his
maturer life was spent.

[172] _author_: dante defines an author as 'one worthy to be believed
and obeyed' (_convito_ iv. 6). for a guide and companion on his great
pilgrimage he chooses virgil, not only because of his fame as a poet,
but also because he had himself descr

ibed a descent to the shades--had
been already there. the vulgar conception of virgil was that of a
virtuous great magician.

[173] _the style, etc._: some at least of dante's minor works had been
given to the world before 1300, certainly the _vita nuova_ and others of
his poems. to his study of virgil he may have felt himself indebted for
the purity of taste that kept him superior to the frigid and artificial
style of his contemporaries, he prided himself on suiting his language
to his theme, as well as on writing straight from the heart.

[174] _many a creature, etc._: great men and states, infected with
avarice in its extended sense of encroachment on the rights of others.

[175] _feltro and feltro, etc._: who the deliverer was that dante
prophesies the coming of is not known, and perhaps

ily, of poor extraction' (_cronica_,
ix. 1). whatever may be made of the feltros, the description in the text
of the deliverer as one superior to all personal ambition certainly
answers better to dante's ideal of a righteous emperor than to the
character of a partisan leader like uguccione della faggiuola, or an
ambitious prince like can grande.

[176] _camilla, etc._: all persons of the _æneid_.

[177] _envy_: that of satan.

[178] _thou hadst best, etc._: as will be seen from the next canto,
virgil has been sent to the relief of dante; but how that is to be
wrought out is left to his own judgment. he might secure a partial
deliverance for his ward by conducting him up the delectable mount--the
peaceful heights familiar to himself, and which are to be won by the
practice of natural piety. he chooses the other course, of guiding dante
through the regions of the future state, where the pilgrim's trust in
the divine government will be strengthened by what he sees, and his soul
acquire a large

r peace.

[179] _a soul_: beatrice.

[180] _the emperor_: the attribution of this title to god is significant
of dante's lofty conception of the empire.

[181] _'gainst his laws, etc._: virgil was a rebel only in the sense of
being ignorant of the christian revelation (_inf._ iv. 37).

[182] _saint peter's gate_: virgil has not mentioned saint peter. dante
names him as if to proclaim that it is as a christian, though under
heathen guidance, that he makes the pilgrimage. here the gate seems to
be spoken of as if it formed the entrance to paradise, as it was
popularly believed to do, and as if it were at that point virgil would
cease to guide him. but they are to find it nearer at hand, and after it
has been passed virgil is to act as guide through purgatory.

footnotes:

[183] _close of day_: the evening of the friday. it comes on us with
something of a surprise that a whole day has been spent in the attempt
to ascend the hill, and in conference with virgil.

[184] _alone_: of earthly creatures, though in company with virgil, a
shade. in these words is to be found the keynote to the canto. with the
sense of deliverance from immediate danger his enthusiasm has died away.
after all, virgil is only a shade; and his heart misgives him at the
thought of engaging, in the absence of all human companionship, upon a
journey so full of terrors. he is not reassured till virgil has
displayed his commission.

[185] _muses_: the invocation comes now, the first

roduction. here it may be pointed out, as illustrating the
refinement of dante's art, that the invocation in the _purgatorio_ is in
a higher strain, and that in the _paradiso_ in a nobler still.

[186] _silvius' father_: æneas, whose visit to the world of shades is
described in the sixth _æneid_. he finds there his father anchises, who
foretells to him the fortunes of his descendants down to the time of
augustus.

[187] _both of these_: dante uses language slightly apologetic as he
unfolds to virgil, the great imperialist poet, the final cause of rome
and the empire. but while he thus exalts the papal office, making all
roman history a preparation for its establishment, dante throughout his
works is careful to refuse any but a spiritual or religious allegiance
to the pope, and leaves himself free, as will be frequently seen in the
course of the _comedy_, to blame the popes as men, while yielding all
honour to their great office. in this emphatic mention of rome as the
divinely-appointed se

 christian sources.

[190] _a dame_: beatrice, the heroine of the _vita nuova_, at the close
of which dante promises some day to say of her what was never yet said
of any woman. she died in 1290, aged twenty-four. in the _comedy_ she
fills different parts: she is the glorified beatrice portinari whom
dante first knew as a fair florentine girl; but she also represents
heavenly truth, or the knowledge of it--the handmaid of eternal life.
theology is too hard and technical a term to bestow on her. virgil, for
his part, represents the knowledge that men may acquire of divine law by
the use of their reason, helped by such illumination as was enjoyed by
the virtuous heathen. in other words, he is the exponent of the divine
revelation involved in the imperial system--for the empire was never far
from dante's thoughts. to him it meant the perfection of just rule, in
which due cognisance is taken of every right and of every duty. the
relation dante bears to these two is that of erring humanity strugg

to the light. virgil leads him as far as he can, and then commits him to
the holier rule of beatrice. but the poem would lose its charm if the
allegorical meaning of every passage were too closely insisted on. and,
worse than that, it cannot always be found.

[191] _dubious state_: the limbo of the virtuous heathen (canto iv.).

[192] _the star_: in the _vita nuova_ dante speaks of the star in the
singular when he means the stars.

[193] _in narrowest space_: the heaven of the moon, on the ptolemaic
system the lowe

ll the flames of earth are attracted. the
meaning is, above all on earth.

[194] _the region vast_: the empyrean, or tenth and highest heaven of
all. it is an addition by the christian astronomers to the heavens of
the ptolemaic system, and extends above the _primum mobile_, which
imparts to all beneath it a common motion, while leaving its own special
motion to each. the empyrean is the heaven of divine rest.

[195] _burning_: 'flame of this burning,' allegorical, as applied to the
limbo where virgil had his abode. he and his companions suffer only from
unfulfilled but lofty desire (_inf._ iv. 41).

[196] _a noble lady_: the virgin mary, of whom it is said (_parad._
xxxiii. 16) that her 'benignity not only succours those who ask, but
often anticipates their demand;' as here. she is the symbol of divine
grace in its widest sense. neither christ nor mary is mentioned by name
in the _inferno_.

[197] _lucia_: the martyr saint of syracuse. witte (_dante-forschungen_,
vol. ii. 30) suggests that

 its primary sense of 'faithful
one;' but it is old italian for vassal; and to take the reference to be
to the duty of the overlord to help his dependant in need seems to give
force to the appeal.

[199] _rachel_: symbol of the contemplative life.

[200] _a flood, etc._: 'the sea of troubles' in which dante is involved.

[201] _tears_: beatrice weeps for human misery--especially that of
dante--though unaffected by the view of the sufferings of inferno.

[202] _my guide, etc._: after hearing how virgil was moved to come,
dante accepts him not only for his guide, as he did at the close of the
first canto, but for his lord and master as well.




canto iii.


  through me to the city dolorous lies the way,
    who pass through me shall pains eternal prove,
    through me are reached the people lost for aye.
  'twas justice did my glorious maker move;

    the highest wisdom, and the primal love.

] _power divine, etc._: the persons of the trinity, described by
their attributes.

[204] _if not eternal_: only the angels and the heavenly spheres were
created before inferno. the creation of man came later. but from _inf._
xxxiv. 124 it appears that inferno was hollowed out of the earth; and at
_parad._ vii. 124 the earth is declared to be 'corruptible and enduring
short while;' therefore not eternal.

[205] _hard, etc._: the injunction to leave all hope behind makes dante
hesitate to enter. virgil anticipates the objection before it is fully
expressed, and reminds him that the passage through inferno is to be
only one stage of his journey. not by this gate will he seek to quit it.

[206] _true good, etc._: truth in its highest form--the contemplation of
god.

[207] _uncouth accents_: 'like german,' says boccaccio.

[208] _horror-stricken_: 'my head enveloped in horror.' some texts have
'error,' and this yields a better meaning--that dante is amazed to have
come full into the crowd of suf

 and
it agrees well with such a profession, that the first stroke he deals in
the _comedy_ is at a pope.

[213] _caitiffs_: to one who had suffered like dante for the frank part
he took in affairs, neutrality may well have seemed the unpardonable sin
in politics; and no doubt but that his thoughts were set on the trimmers
in florence when he wrote, 'let us not speak of them!'

[214] _a veteran_: charon. in all this description of the passage of the
river by the shades, dante borrows freely from virgil. it has been
already remarked on _inf._ ii. 28 that he draws illustrations from pagan
sources. more than that, as we begin to find, he boldly introduces
legendary and mythological characters among the persons of his drama.
with milton in mind, it surprises, on a first acquaintance with the
_comedy_, to discover how nearly independent of angels is the economy
invented by dante for the other world.

[215] _other ways, etc._: the souls bound from earth to purgatory gather
at the mouth of the tiber

ng a denizen of inferno. it is
only the pains of purgatory that oppress his soul by anticipation. so
here charon is made to see at a glance that the pilgrim is not of those
'who make descent to acheron.'

[216] _as fowls, etc._: 'as a bird to its lure'--generally interpreted
of the falcon when called back. but a witness of the sport of netting
thrushes in tuscany describes them as 'flying into the vocal ambush in a
hurried, half-reluctant, and very remarkable manner.'

[217] _courteous master_: virgil here gives the answer promised at line
76; and dante by the epithet he uses removes any impression that his
guide had been wanting in courtesy when he bade him wait.

[218] _wherefore_: charon's displeasure only proves that he feels he has
no hold on dante.

[219] _trembled, etc._: symbolical of the increase of woe in inferno
when the doomed souls have landed on the thither side of acheron. hell
opens to receive them. conversely, when any purified soul is released
from purgatory the mountain of

circular ledges or terraces, of great width in the case of the upper
ones, running round its wall--that is, round the sides of the pit. each
terrace or circle is thus less in circumference than the one above it.
from one circle to the next there slopes a bank of more or less height
and steepness. down the bank which falls to the comparatively flat
ground of the first circle they are now about to pass.--to put it
otherwise, the inferno is an inverted hollow cone.

[221] _pity_: the pity felt by virgil has reference only to those in the
circle they are about to enter, which is his own. see also _purg._ iii.
43.

[222] _wouldst thou, etc._: he will not have dante form a false opinion
of the character of those condemned to the circle which is his own.

[223] _part_: _parte_, altered by some editors into _porta_; but though
baptism is technically described as the gate of the sacraments, it never
is as the gate of the faith. a tenet of dante's faith was that all the
unbaptized are lost. he had no
 
 ___________________________
 
 choice in the matter.

[224] _limbo_: border, or borderland. dante makes the first circle
consist of the two limbos of thomas aquinas: that of unbaptized infants,
_limbus puerorum_, and that of the fathers of the old covenant, _limbus
sanctorum patrum_. but the second he finds is now inhabited only by the
virtuous heathen.

[225] _sir_--_master_: as a delicate means of expressing sympathy, dante
redoubles his courtesy to virgil.

[226] _hidden drift_: to find out, at first hand as it were, if the
article in the creed is true which relates to the descent into hell;
and, perhaps, to learn if when christ descended he delivered none of the
virtuous heathen.

[227] _lately_: virgil died about half a century before the crucifixion.

[228] _a potentate_: the name of christ is not mentioned in the
_inferno_.

[229] _a hemisphere, etc._: an elaborate way of saying that part of the
limbo was clearly lit. the flame is symbolical

benvenuto of imola is:
'poets love and honour one another, and are never envious and
quarrelsome like those who cultivate the other arts and sciences.'--i
quote with misgiving from tamburini's untrustworthy italian translation.
benvenuto lectured on the _comedy_ in bologna for some years about 1370.
it is greatly to be wished that his commentary, lively and full of
side-lights as it is, should be printed in full from the original latin.

[234] _the lords, etc._: not the company of him--homer or virgil--who is
lord of the great song, and soars above all others; but the company of
the great masters, whose verse, etc.

[235] _did my master smile_: to see dante made free of the guild of
great poets; or, it may be, to think they are about to discover in him a
fellow poet.

[236] _a noble castle_: where the light burns, and in which, as their
peculiar seat, the shades of the heathen distinguished for virtue and
genius reside. the seven walls are in their number symbolical of the
perfect strength o

such. 'he sits apart, because not of gentle birth,' says boccaccio;
which shows what even a man of genius risks when he becomes a
commentator.

[241] _the master_: aristotle, often spoken of by dante as the
philosopher, and reverenced by him as the genius to whom the secrets of
nature lay most open.

[242] _democritus, etc._: according to whom the world owes its form to a
chance arrangement of atoms.

[243] _linus_: not livy, into which some have changed it. linus is
mentioned by virgil along with orpheus, _egl._ iv.

[244] _ptolemy_: greek geographer of the beginning of the second
century, and author of the system of the world believed in by dante, and
freely used by him throughout the poem.

[245] _avicenna_: a physician, born in bokhara, and died at ispahan,
1037. his _medical canon_ was for centuries used as a text-book in
europe.

[246] _averroes_: a mohammedan philosopher of cordova, died 1198. in his
great commentary on aristotle he gives and explains every sentence of

r their doom,
just as they fall inevitably one by one into charon's boat. minos by a
sort of devilish instinct sentences each sinner to his appropriate
punishment. in _inf._ xxvii. 127 we find the words in which minos utters
his judgment. in _inf._ xxi. 29 a devil bears the sinner to his own
place.

[251] _why also, etc._: like charon. if minos represents conscience, as
some would have it, dante is here again assailed by misgivings as to his
enterprise, and is quieted by reason in the person of virgil.

[252] _thus 'tis willed, etc._: these two lines are the same as those to
charon, _inf._ iii. 95, 96.

[253] _precipitous extreme_: opinions vary as to what is meant by
_ruina_. as dante is certainly still on the outer edge of the second
circle or terrace, and while standing there hears distinctly the words
the spirits say when they reach the _ruina_, it most likely denotes the
steep slope falling from the first to the second circle. the spirits,
driven against the wall which hems them in, bur

them with its voice' (brunetto latini, _tesoro_, v. 27).

[256] _what folk are these_: the general crowd of sinners guilty of
unlawful love are described as being close packed like starlings. the
other troop, who go in single file like cranes, are those regarding whom
dante specially inquires; and they prove to be the nobler sort of
sinners--lovers with something tragic or pathetic in their fate.

[257] _the next_: dido, perhaps not named by virgil because to him she
owed her fame. for love of æneas she broke the vow of perpetual chastity
made on the tomb of her husband.

[258] _at the last, etc._: achilles, when about to espouse polyxena, and
when off his guard, was slain.

[259] _paris ... and tristram_: paris of troy, and the tristram of king
arthur's table.

[260] _so light_: denoting the violence of the passion to which they had
succumbed.

[261] _if none_: if no superior power.

[262] _doves_: the motion of the tempest-driven shade

s is compared to
the flight of birds--starlings, cranes, and doves. this last simile
prepares us for the tenderness of francesca's tale.

[263] _dido_: has been already indicated, and is now named. this
association of the two lovers with virgil's dido is a further delicate
touch to engage our sympathy; for her love, though illicit, was the
infirmity of a noble heart.

[264] _living creature_: 'animal.' no shade, but an animated body.

[265] _thy peace_: peace from all the doubts that assail him, and which
have compelled him to the journey: peace, it may be, from temptation to
sin cognate to her own. even in the gloom of inferno her great
goodheartedness is left her--a consolation, if not a grace.

[266] _your demand_: by a refinement

of courtesy, francesca, though
addressing only dante, includes virgil in her profession of willingness
to tell all they care to hear. but as almost always, he remains silent.
it is not for his good the journey is being made.

[267] _native city_: ravenna. the speaker is francesca, daughter of
guido of polenta, lord of ravenna. about the year 1275 she was married
to gianciotto (deformed john) malatesta, son of the lord of rimini; the
marriage, like most of that time in the class to which she belonged,
being one of political convenience. she allowed her affections

to is to find his place in caïna. the words are more in
keeping with the masculine than the feminine character. they certainly
jar somewhat with the gentler censure of line 102. and, immediately
after, dante speaks of what the 'souls' have said.

[271] _thy teacher_: boethius, one of dante's favourite authors
(_convito_ ii. 13), says in his _de consol. phil._, 'the greatest misery
in adverse fortune is once to have been happy.' but, granting that dante
found the idea in boethius, it is clearly virgil that francesca means.
she sees that dante's guide is a shade, and gathers from his grave
passionless aspect that he is one condemned for ever to look back with
futile regret upon his happier past.

[272] _lancelot_: king arthur's famous knight, who was too bashful to
make his love for queen guinivere known to her. galahad, holding the
secret of both, persuaded the queen to make the first declaration of
love at a meeting he arranged for between them. her smile, or laugh, as
she 'took lancelot by

[293] _pape, etc._: these words have exercised the ingenuity of many
scholars, who on the whole lean to the opinion that they contain an
appeal to satan against the invasion of his domain. virgil seems to have
understood them, but the text leaves it doubtful whether dante himself
did. later on, but there with an obvious purpose, we find a line of pure
gibberish (_inf._ xxxi. 67).

[294] _plutus_: the god of riches; degraded here into a demon. he guards
the fourth circle, which is that of the misers and spendthrifts.

he and his companion come.

between the misers and spendthrifts, and the two bands at set periods
clash against one another in their vain effort to pass into the section
belonging to the opposite party. their condition is emblematical of
their sins while in life. they were one-sided in their use of wealth; so

dependent on the generosity of others he must have watched how at a bare
hint the faces of miser and spendthrift fell, while their eyes travelled
vaguely beyond him, and their voices grew cold.

[301] _ruined locks_: 'a spendthrift will spend his very hair,' says an
italian proverb.

[302] _the happy land_: heaven.

[303] _her claws_: dante speaks of fortune as if she were a brutal and
somewhat malicious power. in virgil's answer there is a refutation of
the opinion of fortune given by dante himself, in the _convito_ (iv.
11). after describing three ways in which the goods of fortune come to
men he says: 'in each of these three ways her injustice is manifest.'
this part of the _convito_ fraticelli seems almost to prove was written
in 1297.

as these spheres and the influences they exercise on human affairs are
under the guidance of divinely-appointed ministers, so, virgil says, is
the distribution of worldly wealth ruled by providence through fortune.

[305] _some races failing_: it was long believed, nor is the belief
quite obsolete, that one community can gain only at the expense of
another. sir thomas browne says: 'all cannot be happy at once; for
because the glory of one state depends upon the ruin of another, there
is a revolution and vicissitude of their greatness, and all must obey
the swing of that wheel, not moved by intelligences, but by the hand of

bound to the city.

[328] _yes and no_: he will return--he will not return. the demons have
said that virgil shall remain, and he has promised dante not to desert
him.

[329] _who dare, etc._: virgil knows the hindrance is only temporary,
but wonders what superior devilish power can have incited the demons to
deny him entrance. the incident displays the fallen angels as being
still rebellious, and is at the same time skilfully conceived to mark a
pause before dante enters on the lower inferno.

from expressing all his thought. the 'unless' may refer to what the
lying demons had told him or threatened him with; the 'proffered aid,'
to that involved in beatrice's request.

below him is unknown to dante.

indirect question, seeks to learn how much experience

result of the war between his father and cæsar. this happened thirty
years before the death of virgil.

[336] _judas' circle_: the judecca, or very lowest point of the inferno.
virgil's death preceded that of judas by fifty years. he gives no hint
of whose the shade was that he went down to fetch; but lucan's tale was
probably in dante's mind. in the middle ages the memory of virgil was
revered as that of a great sorcerer, especially in the neighbourhood of
naples.

s difficult to believe. rather they are strange because of
the meaning they convey. what that is, dante warns the reader of
superior intellect to pause and consider. it has been noted (_inf._ ii.
28) how he uses the characters of the old mythology as if believing in
their real existence. but this is for his poetical ends. here he bids us
look below the surface and seek for the truth hidden under the strange
disguise.--the opposition to their progress offered by the powers of
hell perplexes even virgil, while dante is reduced to a state of
absolute terror, and is afflicted with still sharper misgivings than he
had at the first as to the issue of his adventure. by an indirect
question he seeks to learn how much virgil really knows of the economy
of the lower world; but he cannot so much as listen to all of his
master's reassuring answer, terrified as he is by the sudden appearance
of the furies upon the tower, which rises out of the city of unbelief.

how, in the face of such foes, is he to find the peace and liberty of
soul of which he is in search? that this is the city of unbelief he has
not yet been told, and without knowing it he is standing under the very
walls of doubting castle. and now, if he chance to let his eyes rest on
the gorgon's head, his soul will be petrified by despair; like the
denizens of hell, he will lose the 'good of the intellect,' and will
pass into a state from which virgil--or reason--will be powerless to
deliver him. but virgil takes him in time, and makes him avert his eyes;
which may signify that the only safe course for men is to turn their
backs on the deep and insoluble problem of how the reality of the divine
government can be reconciled with the apparent triumph of evil.

infernal regions, fastened a chain round his neck and dragged him to the
gate. the angel's speech answers dante's doubts as to the limits of
diabolical power.

[346] _by other cares, etc._: it is not in inferno that dante is to hold
converse with celestial intelligences. the angel, like beatrice when she
sought virgil in limbo, is all on fire to return to his own place.

[347] _arles_: the alyscampo (elysian fields) at arles was an enormous
cemetery, of which ruins still exist. it had a circumference of about
six miles, and contained numerous sarcophagi dating from roman times.

to the other, their course is usually to the left hand. here for some
reason virgil turns to the right, so as to have the tombs on the left as
he advances. it may be that a special proof of his knowledge of the
locality is introduced when most needed--after the repulse by the
demons--to strengthen dante's confidence in him as a guide; or, as some
subtly think, they being now about to enter the abode of heresy, the
movement to the right signifies the importance of the first step in
forming opinion. the only other occasion on which their course is taken
to the right hand is at _

because adverse to the first principles of all religions. dante, in his
treatment of heresy, dwells more on what affects conduct as does the
denial of the divine government--than on intellectual divergence from
orthodox belief.

[356] _as well as, etc._: the question is: 'may they be seen?' the wish
is a desire to speak with them.

silence on dante, as, for instance, at _inf._ iii. 51.

a huge sarcophagus, come words similar to the _siste viator!_ common on
roman tombs.

ghibeline error of epicureanism. when in order to allay party rancour
some of the guelf and ghibeline families were forced to intermarry, his
son guido took a daughter of farinata's to wife. this was in 1267, so
that guido was much older than dante. yet they were very intimate, and,
intellectually, had much in common. with him dante exchanged poems of
occasion, and he terms him more than once in the _vita nuova_ his chief
friend. the disdain of virgil need not mean more than is on the surface.
guido died in 1301. he is the hero of the _decameron_, vi. 9.

[364] _the lady_: proserpine; _i.e._ the moon. ere fifty months from

florence. the great attempt was in the beginning of 1304.

[379] _injury_: they have left above them the circles of those whose sin
consists in the exaggeration or misdirection of a wholesome natural
instinct. below them lie the circles filled with such as have been
guilty of malicious wickedness. this manifests itself in two ways: by
violence or by fraud. after first mentioning in a general way that the
fraudulent are set lowest in inferno, virgil proceeds to define
violence, and to tell how the violent occupy the circle immediately
beneath them--the seventh. for division of the maliciously wicked into
two classes dante is supposed to be indebted to cicero: 'injury may be
wrought by force or by fraud.... both are unnatural for man, but fraud
is the more hateful.'--_de officiis_, i. 13. it is remarkable that
virgil says nothing of those in the sixth circle in this account of the
classes of sinners.

regard to manners, these three things are to be eschewed: incontinence,
vice, and bestiality.' aristotle holds incontinence to consist in the
immoderate indulgence of propensities which under right guidance are
adapted to promote lawful pleasure. it is, generally speaking, the sin
of which those about whom dante has inquired were guilty.--it has been
ingeniously sought by philalethes (_gött. com._) to show that virgil's
disquisition is founded on this threefold classification of
aristotle's--violence being taken to be the same as bestiality, and
malice as vice. but the reference to aristotle is made with the limited
purpose of justifying the lenient treatment of incontinence; in the same
way as a few lines further on genesis is referred to in support of the
harsh treatment of usury.

of the hymn _vexilla: prædamque tulit tartaris_.

ere they acquired a settlement in italy. here the harpies symbolise
shameful waste and disgust with life.

what virgil tells (_æn._ iii.) of the blood and piteous voice that
issued from the torn bushes on the tomb of polydorus.

his debt to virgil; and, perhaps, at the same time puts in his claim to
an imaginative licence equal to that taken by his master. on a modern
reader the effect of the reference is to weaken the verisimilitude of
the incident.

 known whether he committed suicide; though he is said to
have done so after being disgraced, by dashing his brains out against a
church wall in pisa. dante clearly follows this legend. the whole
episode is eloquent of the esteem in which peter's memory was held by
dante. his name is not mentioned in inferno, but yet the promise is
amply kept that it shall flourish on earth again, freed from unmerited
disgrace. he died about 1249.

[424] _the harlot_: envy.

[425] _of what thou thinkest, etc._: virgil never asks a question for
his own satisfaction. he knows who the spirits are, what brought them
there, and which of them will speak honestly out on the promise of
having his fame refreshed in the world. it should be noted how, by a
hint, he has made peter aware of who he is (line 48); a delicate
attention yielded to no other shade in the inferno, except ulysses

which, as the seat of the empire and the church, holds the secret of the
future. the tears of time shed by every age save that of gold feed the
four infernal streams and pools of acheron, styx, phlegethon, and
cocytus. line 117 indicates that these are all fed by the same water;
are in fact different names for the same flood of tears. the reason why
dante has not hitherto observed the connection between them is that he
has not made a complete circuit of each or indeed of any circle, as
virgil reminds him at line 124, etc. the rivulet by which they stand
drains the boiling phlegethon--where the water is all changed to blood,
because in it the murderers are punished--and flowing through the forest
of the suicides and the desert of the blasphemers, etc., tumbles into
the eighth circle as described in canto xvi. 103. cocytus they are
afterward to reach. an objection to this account of the infernal rivers
as being all fed by the same waters may be found in the difference of

safety, strictly defined by the edge of the causeway. we are to imagine
to ourselves the fire of sodom falling on brunetto's upturned face, and
missing dante's head only by an inch.

[462] _yestermorn_: this is still the saturday. it was friday when dante
met virgil.

[463] _guided by whom_: brunetto has asked who the guide is, and dante
does not tell him. a reason for the refusal has been ingeniously found
in the fact that among the numerous citations of the _treasure_ brunetto
seldom quotes virgil. see also the charge brought against guido
cavalcanti (_inf._ x. 63), of holding virgil in disdain. but it is
explanation enough of dante's omission to name his guide that he is

obscure sentence that seems the best which applies it to virgil's
_quicquid erit, superanda omnis fortuna ferendo est_--'whatever shall
happen, every fate is to be vanquished by endurance' (_æn._ v. 710).
taking this way of it, we have in the form of dante's profession of
indifference to all the adverse fortune that may be in store

having so well attended to his advice to store farinata's prophecy in
his memory (_inf._ x.127).

belongs, and from which for the time he has separated himself.

object into the depth where he lies concealed. but, since they are
surrounded by solid masonry and slack sand, one or other of them must
supply something fit to throw down; and the cord worn by dante is fixed
on as what can best be done without. there may be a reference to the

commentators, wore when he was a young man, following in this a fashion

with it ever since he entered by the gate, it has not saved him from a
single fear, far less from a single danger; and now it is cast away as
useless. henceforth, more than ever, he is to confide wholly in virgil
and have no confidence in himself. nor is he to be girt again till he
reaches the coast of purgatory, and then it is to be with a reed, the
emblem of humility.--but, however explained, the incident will always be
somewhat of a puzzle.

[495] dante attributes to virgil full knowledge of all that is in his
own mind. he thus heightens our conception of his dependence on his
guide, with whose will his will is blent, and whose thoughts are always
found to be anticipating his own. few readers will ca

recalling to mind that virgil represents enlightened human reason. but
even if we confine ourselves to the easiest sense of the narrative, the
study of the relations between him and dante will be found one of the
most interesting suggested by the poem--perhaps only less so than that
of dante's moods of wonder, anger, and pity.

defence against fraud.

[498] _the bank_: not that which confines the brook but the inner limit
of the seventh circle, from which the precipice sinks sheer into the
eighth, and to which the embankment by which the travellers have crossed
the sand joins itself on. virgil has beckoned geryon to come to that
part of the bank which adjoins the end of the causeway.

subterfuges.

it is clear that they might have kept to the embankment until they were
clear beyond the edge of the sand. we are therefore to figure to
ourselves the water as plunging down at a point some yards, perhaps the
width of the border, short of the true limit of the circle; and this is
a touch of local truth, since waterfalls in time always wear out a
funnel for themselves by eating back the precipice down which they
tumble. it was into this funnel that virgil flung the cord, and up it
that geryon was seen to ascend, as if by following up the course of the
water he would find out who had made the signal. to keep to the narrow
causeway where it ran on by the edge of this gulf would seem too full of
risk.

[505] _woful folk_: usurers; those guilty of the unnatural sin of
contemning the legitimate modes of human industry. they sit huddled up
on the sand, close to its bound of solid masonry, from which dante looks
down on them. but that the usurers are n

describes the sulky, slow descent of a falcon which has either lost
sight of its prey, or has failed to discover where the falconer has
thrown the lure. geryon has descended thus deliberately owing to the
command of virgil.

 which is the ninth
circle. the bolgias or valleys are divided from each other by rocky
banks; and, each bolgia being at a lower level than the one that
encloses it, the inside of each bank is necessarily deeper than the
outside. ribs or ridges of rock--like spokes of a wheel to the
axle-tree--run from the foot of the precipice to the outer rim of the
'well,' vaulting the moats at right angles with the course of them. thus
each rib takes the form of a ten-arched bridge. by one or other of these
virgil and dante now travel towards the centre and the base of inferno;
their general course being downward, though varied by the ascent in turn
of the hog-backed arches over the moats.

[519] _more swift_: the sinners in the first bolgia are divided into two
gangs, moving in opposite directions, the course of those on the outside
being to the right, as looked at by dante. these are the shades of
panders; those in the inner current are such as seduced on their own
account. here a list of the various c

courtesan, asks gnatho, their go-between, if she really sent him many
thanks for the present of a slave-girl he had sent her. 'enormous!' says
gnatho. it proves what great store dante set on ancient instances when
he thought this worth citing.

most subject to this mania of divination; and of this dante is himself
an instance, as is well proved by this book of his.' dante reminds the
reader how often since the journey began he has sought to have the veil
of the future lifted; and would have it understood that he was seized by
a sudden misgiving as to whether he too had not overstepped the bounds
of what, in that respect, is allowed and right.

[557] _of the other fools_: dante, weeping like the sinners in the
bolgia, is asked by virgil: 'what, art thou then one of them?' he had
been suffered, without reproof, to show pity for francesca and ciacco.
the terrors of the lord grow more cogent as they descend, and even pity
is now forbidden.

foresaw his own death, and sought by hiding to evade it; but his wife

situated on the gulf of spezia, and under the carrara mountains

daughter of tiresias.--here begins a digression on the early history of

his master attributes to an italian one (_æn._ x. 199).

lordship; and by expelling some of the citizens and putting others of
them to death he greatly thinned the population of the city.

by this digression of virgil's, and dante himself seems conscious that
it is somewhat ill-timed.

engaged in the trojan expedition.

line dividing the hemisphere of jerusalem, in which they are, from that
of the mount of purgatory. according to dante's scheme of the world,
purgatory is the true opposite of jerusalem; and seville is ninety
degrees from jerusalem. as it was full moon the night before last, and
the moon is now setting, it is now fully an hour after sunrise. but, as
has already been said, it is not possible to reconcile the astronomical
indications thoroughly with one another.--virgil serves as clock to
dante, for they can see nothing of the skies.

[575] _from bridge to bridge_: they cross the barrier separating the
fourth from the fifth bolgia, and follow the bridge which spans the
fifth until they have reached the crown of it. we may infer that the
conversation of virgil and dante turned on foreknowledge of the future.

[576] _darkness, etc._: the pitch with which the trench of the bolgia is
filled absorbs most of the scanty light accorded to malebolge.

[577] _the venetians_: but for this picturesque description of the old
arsenal, and a passing mention of the rialto in one passage of the
_paradiso_, and of the venetian coinage in another, it could not be
gathered from the _comedy_, with all its wealth of historical and
geographical references, that there was

fingers. they misused wards and all subject to them, and in their turn
are clawed and torn by their devilish guardians.

ix. 22).

[586] _the sixth bank_: dante remains on the crown of the arch
overhanging the pitch-filled moat. virgil descends from the bridge by
the left hand to the bank on the inner side of the fifth bolgia.

[587] _what will this, etc._: as if he said: what good will this delay
do him in the long-run?

florence in 1289 to help the lucchese against the pisans, and was
present at the surrender by the pisan garrison of the castle of caprona.

we have enough of the horrid crew without considering too closely how
they are called.

[592] _unbroken_: malacoda repeats his lie.

[593] _each bit his tongue, etc._: the demons, aware of the cheat played
by malacoda, show their devilish humour by making game of virgil and
dante.--benvenuto is amazed that a man so involved in his own thoughts
as dante was, should have been such a close observer of low life as this
passage shows him. he is sure that he laughed to himself as he wrote the
canto.

circular ridge that divides it from the fifth. from the construction of
malebolge the ridge is deeper on the inner side than on that up which
they have travelled from the pitch.

[615] _no more a cause of dread_: there seems some incongruity between
virgil's dread of these smaller devils and the ease with which he cowed
minos, charon, and pluto. but his character gains in human interest the
more he is represented as sympathising with dante in his terrors; and in
this particular case the confession of fellow-feeling prepares the way
for the beautiful passage which follows it (line 38, etc.), one full of
an almost modern tenderness.

the scribes and pharisees who persecuted jesus to the death, are the
vilest hypocrites of all. they lie naked across the path, unburdened by
the leaden cloak, it is true, but only that they may feel the more
keenly the weight of the punishment of all the hypocrites of the world.

[624] _virgil_: on virgil's earlier journey through inferno caiaphas and
the others were not here, and he wonders as at something out of a world
to him unknown.

the rocky barrier between them and the seventh bolgia is on their right.

end of january till the end of february; and already, say in the middle
of february, the day is nearly as long as the night.

[631] _where i ailed, etc._: as the peasant is in despair at seeing the
earth white with what he thinks is snow, so was dante at the signs of
trouble on virgil's face. he has mistaken anger at the cheat for
perplexity as to how they are to escape from the bolgia; and his
master's smile is grateful and reassuring to him as the spectacle of the
green earth to the despairing shepherd.

[632] _the broken bridge_: they are about to escape from the bottom of
the sixth bolgia by climbing the wall between it and the seventh, at the

describes him as half human. the pool was fed with the blood of his
human victims. the herd was the spoil hercules took from geryon. in the
_æneid_ cacus defends himself from hercules by vomiting a fiery smoke;
and this doubtless suggested the dragon of the text.

of the thieves, the centaur cacus takes a special malign interest.

ulysses and diomed (_æn._ ii.). ulysses is here upon his own ground.

[681] _they were greek_: some find here an allusion to dante's ignorance
of the greek language and literature. but virgil addresses them in the
lombard dialect of italian (_inf._ xxvii. 21). he acts as spokesman
because those ancient greeks were all so haughty that to a common modern
mortal they would have nothing to say. he, as the author of the _æneid_,
has a special claim on their good-nature. it is but seldom that the
shades are told who virgil is, and never directly. here ulysses may
infer it from the mention of the 'lofty verse.'

[693] _depart, etc._: one at least of the words quoted as having been
used by virgil is lombard. there is something very quaint in making him
use the lombard dialect of dante's time.

[694] _'tween springs, etc._: montefeltro lies between urbino and the
mountain where the tiber has its source.

to guido's question, bearing as it did on modern italian affairs.

opinion--in this case.

footnotes:

[735] _thou didst not, etc._: it is a noteworthy feature in the conduct
of the poem that when dante has once gained sufficient knowledge of any
group in the inferno he at once detaches his mind from it, and, carrying
on as little arrear of pity as he can, gives his thoughts to further
progress on the journey. the departure here made from his usual
behaviour is presently accounted for. virgil knows why he lingers, but
will not seem to approve of the cause.

[736] _twenty miles and two_: the ninth bolgia has a circumference of
twenty-two miles, and as the procession of the shades is slow it would
indeed involve a protracted halt to wait till all had passed beneath the
bridge. virgil asks ironically if he wishes to count them all. this
precise detail, taken along with one of the same kind in the following
canto (line 86), has suggested the attempt to construct the inferno to a
scale.

[740] _hautefort_: bertrand de born's castle in gascony.

[741] _my ruth_: enlightened moralist though dante is, he yet shows
himself man of his age enough to be keenly alive to the extremest claims
of kindred; and while he condemns the _vendetta_ by the words put into
virgil's mouth, he confesses to a feeling of meanness not to have
practised it on behoof of a distant relative. there is a high art in
this introduction of geri del bello. had they conferred together dante
must have seemed either cruel or pusillanimous, reproaching or being
reproached. as it is, all the poetry of the situation comes out the
stronger that they do not meet face to face: the threatening finger, the
questions hastily put to geri by the astonished shades, and his

alleviation of their suffering.

on a charge of heresy. albert of siena is said to have been a relative,
some say the natural son, of the bishop of siena. a man of the name

light. there seems to be no authentic testimony regarding the incident

wider licence and here as elsewhere refuses nothing, even in the way of
mean detail, calculated to convey to his readers 'a full experience of
the inferno' as he conceived of it--the place 'where all the vileness of
the world is cast.'

    biting till both my cheeks were crimsoned o'er,

    hands in whose grip even hercules once was wrung.

the saracens at saragossa, left roland to bring up his rear-guard. the
enemy fell on this in superior strength, and slew the christians almost
to a man. then roland, mortally wounded, sat down under a tree in
roncesvalles and blew upon his famous horn a blast so loud that it was
heard by charles at a distance of several miles.--the _chansons de
geste_ were familiarly known to italians of all classes.

[784] _then tenderly, etc._: the wound inflicted by his reproof has been
already healed, but virgil still behaves to dante with more than his
wonted gentleness. he will have him assured of his sympathy now that
they are about to descend into the 'lowest depth of all wickedness.'

[785] _montereggioni_: a fortress about six miles from siena, of which
ample ruins still exist. it had no central keep, but twelve towers rose
from its circular wall like spikes from the rim of a coronet. they had
been added by the sienese in 1260, and so were comparatively new in
dante's time.--as the towers stood r

another, i think the measurement made
specially for philalethes may be accepted as substantially correct.
according to that, the cone is ten palms long--about six feet. allowing
something for the neck, down to 'where a man clasps his cloak' (line
66), and taking the thirty palms as eighteen feet, we get twenty-six
feet or so for half his height. the giants vary in bulk; whether they do
so in height is not clear. we cannot be far mistaken if we assume them
to stand from fifty to sixty feet high. virgil and dante must throw
their heads well back to look up into the giant's face; and virgil must
raise his voice as he speaks.--with regard to the height of the cone it
may be remarked that murray's handbook for rome makes it eleven feet
high; gsell-fels two and a half metres, or eight feet and three inches.
it is so placed as to be difficult of measurement.

be, if standing one on the head of the other would not have reached hi

ante enlarges upon the confusion of tongues, and speaks of the
tower of babel as having been begun by men on the persuasion of a giant.

[789] _ephialtes_: one of the giants who in the war with the gods piled
ossa on pelion.

[790] _antæus_: is to be asked to lift them over the wall, because,
unlike nimrod, he can understand what is said to him, and, unlike
ephialtes, is not bound. antæus is free-handed because he took no part
in the war with the gods.

[791] _the one thou'dst see_: briareus. virgil here gives dante to know
what is the truth about briareus (see line 97, etc.). he is not, as he
was fabled, a monster with a hundred hands, but is like ephialtes, only
fiercer to see. hearing himself thus made light of ephialtes trembles
with anger, like a tower rocking in an earthquake.

[792] _five ell_: five ells make about thirty palms, so that antæus is
of the same stature as that assigned to nimrod at line 65. this supports
the view that the 'huger' of line 84 may apply to breadth rather

battle corresponding to that between david and goliath. lucan's
_pharsalia_, a favourite authority with dante, supplies him with these
references to scipio and antæus.

[794] _cocytus_: the frozen lake fed by the waters of phlegethon. see
canto xiv. at the end.

[795] _tityus, etc._: these were other giants, stated by lucan to be
less strong than antæus. this introduction of their names is therefore a
piece of flattery to the monster. a light contemptuous turn is given by
virgil to his flattery when in the following sentence he bids antæus not
curl his snout, but at once comply with the demand for aid. there is
something genuinely italian in the picture given of the giants in this
canto, as of creatures whose intellect bears no proportion to their bulk
and brute strength. mighty hunters like nimrod, skilled in sounding the
horn but feeble in reasoned speech, frisians with great thews and long
of limb, and german men-at-arms who traded in their rude valour, to the

footnotes:

[858] _vexilla, etc._: '_the banners of the king of hell advance._' the
words are adapted from a hymn of the cross used in holy week; and they
prepare us to find in lucifer the opponent of 'the emperor who reigns on
high' (_inf._ i. 124). it is somewhat odd that dante should have put a
christian hymn into virgil's mouth.

[859] _now was i where_: in the fourth and inner division or ring of the
ninth circle. here are punished those guilty of treachery to their
lawful lords or to their benefactors. from judas iscariot, the
arch-traitor, it takes the name of judecca.

[860] _some stood, etc._: it has been sought to distinguish the degrees
of treachery of the shades by means of the various attitudes assigned to
them. but it is difficult to make more out of it than that some are
suffering more than others.

all of them are the worst of traitors,
hard-hearted and cold-hearted, and now they are quite frozen in the ice,
sealed up even from the poor relief of intercourse with their
fellow-sinners.

[861] _the creature once, etc._: lucifer, guilty of treachery against
the highest, at _purg._ xii. 25 described as 'created noble beyond all
other creatures.' virgil calls him dis, the name used by him for pluto
in the _æneid_, and the name from which that of the city of unbelief is
taken (_inf._ viii. 68).

[862] _judge then what bulk_: the arm of lucifer was as much longer than
the stature of one of the giants as a giant was taller than dante. we
have seen (_inf._ xxxi. 58) that the giants were more than fifty feet in
height--nine times the stature of a man. if a man's arm be taken as a
third of his stature, then satan is twenty-seven times as tall as a

rstand the significance of this harsh treatment of
the great republicans it is necessary to bear in mind that dante's
devotion to the idea of the empire was part of his religion, and far
surpassed in intensity all we can now well imagine. in the absence of a
just and strong emperor the divine government of the world seemed to him
almost at a stand.

[868] _night is rising_: it is saturday evening, and twenty-four hours
since they entered by the gate of inferno.

[869] _i thought to hell, etc._: virgil, holding on to lucifer's hairy
sides, descends the dark and narrow space between him and the ice as far
as to his middle, which marks the centre of the earth. here he swings
himself round so as to have his feet to the centre as he emerges from
the pit to the southern hemisphere. dante now feels that he is being
carried up, and, able to see nothing in the darkness, deems they are
climbing back to the inferno. virgil's difficulty in turning himself
round and climbing up the legs of lucifer arises

 from his being then at
the 'centre to which all weights tend from every part.' dante shared the
erroneous belief of the time, that things grew heavier the nearer they
were to the centre of the earth.

[870] _his upturned legs_: lucifer's feet are as far above where virgil
and dante are as was his head above the level of the judecca.

[871] _what point, etc._: the centre of the earth. dante here feigns to
have been himself confused--a fiction which helps to fasten attention on
the wonderful fact that if we could make our way through the earth we
should require at the centre to reverse our posture. this was more of a
wonder in dante's time than now.

which tierce was the first and began at sunri

se. it is now about
half-past seven in the morning. the night was beginning when they took
their departure from the judecca: the day is now as far advanced in the
southern hemisphere as they have spent time on the passage. the journey
before them is long indeed, for they have to ascend to the surface of
the earth.

[873] _to morn from night_: dante's knowledge of the time of day is
wholly derived from what virgil tells him. since he began his descent
into the inferno he has not seen the sun.

[874] _'neath whose summit_: jerusalem is in the centre of the northern
hemisphere--an opinion founded perhaps on _ezekiel_ v. 5: 'jerusalem i
have set in the midst of the nations and countries round about her.' in
the _convito_, iii. 5, we find dante's belief regarding the distribution
of land and sea clearly given: 'for those i write for it is enough to
know that the earth is fixed and does not move, and that, wi
