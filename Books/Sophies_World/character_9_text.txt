tayed in her room until her mother called her down to a big midday meal. she
had prepared sirloin steak and baked potatoes. there were cloudberries and cream for
dessert. 
they talked about all kinds of things. sophie's mother asked her how she wanted to
celebrate her fifteenth birthday. it was only a few weeks away.
sophie shrugged.
"aren't you going to invite anyone? i mean, don't you want to have a party?"
"maybe."
"we could ask martha and anne marie ... and helen. and joanna, of course. and
jeremy, perhaps. but that's for you to decide. i remember my own fifteenth birthday
so clearly, you know. it doesn't seem all that long ago. i felt i was already quite grown
up. isn't it odd, sophie! i don't feel i have changed at all since then."
"you haven't. nothing changes. you have just developed, gotten older..."
"mm ... that was a very grownup thing to say. i just think it's all happened so very
quickly."

"especially not considering the rather unusual address: hilde moller knag, c/o sophie
amundsen, fu-rulia junior high school..."
"do you think it could have come by mail? and the teacher just popped it in your
exercise book?"
"no idea. i don't know whether i dare ask either."
no more was said about the postcard.
"i'm going to have a garden party on midsummer eve," said sophie.
"with boys?"
sophie shrugged her shoulders. "we don't have to invite the worst idiots."
"but you are going to invite jeremy?"
"if you want. by the way, i might invite alberto knox."
"you must be crazy!"
"i know."
that was as far as the conversation got before their ways parted at the supermarket.
the first thing sophie did when she got home was to see if hermes was in the garden.
sure enough, there he was, sniffing around the apple trees.
"hermes!"
the dog stood motionless for a second. sophie knew exactly what was going on in
that second: the dog heard her call, recognized her voice, and decided to see if she 
was

 sophie was certain her
mother had only put it there because sophie had told her she was not sure she wanted
to be confirmed. her mother seemed to think the cake embodied the confirmation
itself.
"we haven't spared any expense," she repeated several times in the half hour before
the party was due to start.
the guests began to arrive. first came three of the girls from sophie's class, dressed in
summer shirts and light cardigans, long skirts, and the barest suggestion of eye
makeup. a bit later, jeremy and david came strolling in through the gate, with a blend
of shyness and boyish arrogance.
"happy birthday!"
"you're an adult now, too!"
sophie noticed that joanna and jeremy had already begun eyeing each other discreetly.
there was something in the air. it was midsummer eve.
everybody had brought birthday presents, and as it was a philosophical garden party,
several of the guests had tried to find out what philosophy was. although not all of
them had managed to find philosophical presents, mo

new boyfriend for the time being. however, this astounding person is sophie's new
philosophy teacher. his prowess extends further than to setting off fireworks.
this man is able, for example, to draw a live rabbit out of a top hat. or was it a crow,
sophie?"
"many thanks," said alberto. he sat down.
"cheers!" said sophie, and the guests raised their glasses and drank his health.
they sat for a long time over their chicken and salad. suddenly joanna got up, walked 
determinedly over to jeremy, and gave him a resounding kiss on the lips. he
responded by trying to topple her backward over the table so as to get a better grip as
he returned her kiss.
"well, i've never ..." exclaimed mrs. ingebrigtsen.
"not on the table, children," was mrs. amundsen's only comment.
"why not?" asked alberto, turning toward her.
"that was an odd question."
"it's never wrong for a real philosopher to ask questions."
a couple of the other boys who had not been kissed started to throw chicken bones up

what is more, with a father who is at sea so much, she makes calls to all parts of the
world. we congratulate you on your fifteenth birthday, sophie!"
"delightful!" exclaimed mrs. ingebrigtsen.
sophie was not sure whether she was referring to her mother, the speech, the birthday
cake, or sophie herself.
the guests applauded, and one of the boys threw a firecracker up into the pear tree.
joanna left the table and pulled jeremy up off his chair. they lay down on the grass
and started kissing each other again. after a while they rolled in under the red-currant
bushes.
"nowadays it's the girl who takes the initiative," said mr. ingebrigtsen.
having said that, he got up and went over to the red-currant bushes where he stood
observing the phenomenon at close quarters. the rest of the guests followed suit.
only sophie and alberto remained sitting at the table. the other guests now stood in a
semicircle around joanna and je

"they can't be stopped," said mrs. ingebrigtsen, not without a certain pride.
"no, generation follows generation," said her husband.
he looked around, expecting applause for his well-chosen words. when the only 
response was a few silent nods, he added: "it can't be helped."
sophie saw from a distance that jeremy was trying to unbutton joanna's white shirt,
which was already covered with green stains from the grass. she was fumbling with
his belt.
"don't catch cold!" said mrs. ingebrigtsen.
sophie looked despairingly at alberto.
"it's happening more quickly than i thought," he said. "we have to get away from here
as soon as possible. i just have to make a short speech."
sophie clapped her hands loudly.
"could everyone please come back and sit down again? alberto is going to make a
speech."

pt joanna and jeremy came drifting back to their places at the table.
"are you really going to make a speech?" asked he-lene amundsen. "how
charming!"
"thank you."
"and you like going for walks, i know. it is so important to stay in shape. and it's so
much nicer when you have a dog to keep you company. hermes, isn't that its name?"
alberto stood up. "dear sophie," he began. "since this is a philosophical garden party,
i will make a philosophical speech."
this was greeted by a burst of applause.
"in this riotous com

you nor anyone else here will miss us for the simple reason that you do not
exist. you are no more than shadows."
"that is the worst insult i've ever heard," mrs. ingebrigtsen burst out. 
her husband nodded.
"if nothing else, we can always get him nailed for defamation of character. i'm sure
he's a communist. he wants to strip us of everything we hold dear. the man's a
scoundrel."
with that, both alberto and the financial adviser sat down. the letter's face was
crimson with rage. now joanna and jeremy also came and sat at the table. their
clothes were grubby and crumpled. joanna's golden hair was caked with mud and
earth.
"mom, i'm going to have a baby," she announced.
"all right, but you'll have to wait till you get home."
she had immediate support from her husband. "she'll simply have to contain herself,"
he said. "and if there is to be a christening tonight, she'll have to arrange it herself."
alberto looked down at sophie with a somber expression.
"it's time."

 bottles had been
knocked over on the table, there was chocolate cake smeared all over the tablecloth
and the dish of raisin buns lay upside down on the lawn. just as sophie arrived, one of
the boys put a firecracker to the layer cake, which exploded all over the table and the 
guests. the worst casualty was mrs. ingebrigtsen's red pants suit. the curious thing
was that both she and everybody else took it with the utmost calm. joanna picked up a
huge piece of chocolate cake, smeared it all over jeremy's face, and proceeded to lick
it off again.
her mother and alberto were sitting in the glider a little way away from the others.
they waved to sophie.
"so you finally had your confidential talk," said sophie.
"and you were perfectly right," said her mother, quite elated now. "alberto is a very
altruistic person. i entrust you to his strong arms."
sophie sat down between them.
two of the boys had managed to climb onto the roof. one of the girls went around
pricking holes in all the balloons with
