[CHARACTER] - 
                [CHARACTER]
is the second highest grade of cognitive activity. as with understanding,
the objects of [CHARACTER] are the forms of the intelligible realm.
unlike understanding, though, [CHARACTER] can only proceed 
with the crutches of images and hypotheses (i.e. unproven assumptions).
