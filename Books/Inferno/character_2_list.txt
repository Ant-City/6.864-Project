Beatrice - 
                One
of the blessed in Heaven, Beatrice aids Dante's journey by asking
an angel to find Virgil and bid him guide Dante through Hell. Like
Dante and Virgil, Beatrice corresponds to a historical personage. Although
the details of her life remain uncertain, we know that Dante fell
passionately in love with her as a young man and never fell out
of it. She has a limited role in Inferno but becomes more prominent
in Purgatorio and Paradiso. In fact, Dante's entire imaginary journey
throughout the afterlife aims, in part, to find Beatrice, whom he
has lost on Earth because of her early death. Critics generally
view Beatrice as an allegorical representation of 
spiritual love.
