ir backs.

â€”barang!

â€”curse your bloody blatant soul, mr dedalus cried, turning on him.

the lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but
feebly:

â€”bang!

mr dedalus stared at him.

â€”watch him, he said. itâ€™s instructive. i wonder will he allow us to
talk.

â€”you got more than that, father, dilly said.

â€”iâ€™m going to show you a little trick, mr dedalus said. iâ€™ll leave
you all where jesus left the jews. look, thereâ€™s all i have. i got
two shillings from jack power and i spent twopence for a shave for the
funeral.

he drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.

â€”canâ€™t you look for some money somewhere? dilly said.

mr dedalus thought and nodded.

â€”i will, he said gravely. i looked all along the gutter in oâ€™connell
street. iâ€™ll try this one now.

â€”youâ€™re very funny, dilly said, grinning.

â€”here, mr dedalus said, handing her two pennies. get a glass of milk for
yourself and a bun or a something. iâ€™ll be home shortly.

he put the othe

road with every one.

â€”well, itâ€™s a fact, says john wyse. and thereâ€™s the man now thatâ€™ll tell
you all about it, martin cunningham.

sure enough the castle car drove up with martin on it and jack power
with him and a fellow named crofter or crofton, pensioner out of
the collector generalâ€™s, an orangeman blackburn does have on the
registration and he drawing his pay or crawford gallivanting around the
country at the kingâ€™s expense.

our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their
palfreys.

â€”ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.
saucy knave! to us!

so saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.

â€”is he a jew or a gentile or a holy roman or a swaddler or what the hell
is he? says ned. or who is he? no offence, crofton.

â€”who is junius? says j. j.

â€”we donâ€™t want him, says crofter the orangeman or presbyterian.

â€”heâ€™s a perverted jew, says martin, from a place in hungary and it was
he drew up all the plans according to the hungarian system. we know that
in the castle.

â€”isnâ€™t he a cousin of bloom the dentist? says jack power.

â€”not at all, says martin. only namesakes. his name was virag, the
fatherâ€™s name that poisoned himself. he changed it by deedpoll, the
father did.

â€”thatâ€™s the new messiah for ireland! says the citizen. island of saints
and sages!

â€”well, theyâ€™re still waiting for their redeemer, says martin. for that
matter so are we.

â€”yes, says j. j., and every male thatâ€™s born they think it may be their
messiah. and every jew is in a tall state of excitement, i believe, till

â€”o, by god, says ned, you should have seen bloom before that son of his
that died was born. i met him one day in the south city markets buying a
tin of neaveâ€™s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.

â€”en ventre sa mÃ¨re, says j. j.

â€”do you call that a man? says the citizen.

â€”i wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says joe.

â€”well, there were two children born anyhow, says jack power.

â€”and who does he suspect? says the citizen.

gob, thereâ€™s many a true word spoken in jest. one of those mixed
middlings he is. lying up in the hotel pisser was telling me once a
month with headache like a totty with her courses. do you know what iâ€™m
telling you? itâ€™d be an act of god to take a hold of a fellow the like
of that and throw him in the bloody sea. justifiable homicide, so it
would. then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of

â€”beg your pardon, says he.

â€”come on boys, says martin, seeing it was looking blue. come along now.

â€”donâ€™t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. itâ€™s a
secret.

and the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.

â€”bye bye all, says martin.

and he got them out as quick as he could, jack power and crofton or
whatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all
at sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.

â€”off with you, says martin to the jarvey.

the milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the
helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward
with all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. a many comely nymphs drew

l of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells
in the church of saint george.

what echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?

by stephen:

      liliata rutilantium. turma circumdet.
      iubilantium te virginum. chorus excipiat.

by bloom:

     heigho, heigho,
     heigho, heigho.

where were the several members of the company which with bloom that day
at the bidding of that peal had travelled from sandymount in the south
to glasnevin in the north?

martin cunningham (in bed), jack power (in bed), simon dedalus (in bed),
ned lambert (in bed), tom kernan (in bed), joe hynes (in bed), john
henry menton (in bed), bernard corrigan (in bed), patsy dignam (in bed),
paddy dignam (in the grave).

alone, what did bloom hear?

the double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the
double vibration of a jewâ€™s harp in the resonant lane.

alone, what did bloom feel?

the cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing
point or the absolute zero of fahrenh
