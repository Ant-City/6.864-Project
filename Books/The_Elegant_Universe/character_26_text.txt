a huge number of particles,
namely photons? it is. but the surprise is in the details. you see, more than three hundred years ago

newton  proclaimed  that  light  consisted  of  a  stream  of  particles,  so  the  idea  is  not  exactly  new.
however,  some  of  newton's  colleagues,  most  notably  the  dutch  physicist  christian  huygens,
disagreed  with  him  and  argued  that  light  is  a  wave.  the  debate  raged  but  ultimately  experiments
carried  out  by  the  english  physicist  thomas young  in  the  early  1800s  showed  that  newton  was
wrong.

a  version  of  young's  experimental  setup—known  as 

the  double-slit  experiment—is
schematically illustrated in figure 4.3. feynman was fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can
be  gleaned  from  carefully  thinking  through  the  implications  of  this  single  experiment,  so  it's  well
worth discussing. as we see from figure 4.3, light is shone on a thin solid barrier in which two slits
are  cut.  a  photographic  pl
