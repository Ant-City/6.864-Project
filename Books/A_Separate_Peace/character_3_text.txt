ept by the eccentric notions of phineas. now the official class leaders and politicians could be seen taking charge, assuming as a matter of course their control of these walks and fields which had belonged only to us. i had the same room which finny and i had shared during the summer, but across the hall, in the large suite where leper lepellier had dreamed his way through july and august amid sunshine and dust motes and windows through which the ivy had reached tentatively into the room, here brinker hadley had established his headquarters. emissaries were already dropping in to confer with him. leper, luckless in his last year as all the others, had been moved to a room lost in an old building off somewhere in the trees toward the gym.after morning classes and lunch i went across to see brinker, started into the room and then stopped. suddenly i did not want to see the trays of snails which leper had passed the summer collecting replaced by brinkers files. not yet. although it was something to h

de big splashes with your hands, to scatter the flaming oil which would be on the surface.so to phineas i said, im too busy for sports, and he went into his incoherent groans and jumbles of words, and i thought the issue was settled until at the end he said, listen, pal, if i cant play sports, youre going to play them for me, and i lost part of myself to him then, and a soaring sense of freedom revealed that this must have been my purpose from the first: to become a part of phineas.chapter 7brinker hadley came across to see me late that afternoon. i had taken a shower to wash off the sticky salt of the naguamsett rivergoing into the devon was like taking a refreshing shower itself, you never had to clean up after it, but the naguamsett was something else entirely. i had never been in it before; it seemed appropriate that my baptism there had taken place on the first day of this winter session, and that i had been thrown into it, in the middle of a fight.i washed the traces off me and then put o

p, and it is that, without any sense of derision at all, that i recall as brinkers salient characteristic, those healthy, determined, not over-exaggerated but definite and substantial buttocks.here you are in your solitary splendor, he went on genially. i can see you have real influence around here. this big room all to yourself. i wish i knew how to manage things like you. he grinned confidingly and sank down on my cot, leaning on his elbow in a relaxed, at-home way.it didnt seem fitting for brinker hadley, the hub of the class, to be congratulating me on influence. i was going to say that while he had a roommate it was frightened brownie perkins, who would never impinge on brinkers comfort in any way, and that they had two rooms, the front one with a fireplace. not that i grudged him any of this. i liked brinker in spite of his winter session efficiency; almost everyone liked brinker.but in the pause i took before replying he started talking in his lighthearted way again. he never let a dull sp

 a clue they soon seemed to forget. i detected no sherlock holmes among them, nor even a dr. watson. no one showed any interest in tracking me, no one pried, no one insinuated. the daily lists of appointments lengthened with the rays of the receding autumn sun until the summer, the opening day, even yesterday became by the middle of october something gotten out of the way and forgotten, because tomorrow bristled with so much to do.in addition to classes and sports and clubs, there was the war. brinker hadley could compose his shortest war poem ever writtenthe waris a boreif he wanted to, but all of us had to take stronger action than that. first there was the local apple crop, threatening to rot because the harvesters had all gone into the army or war factories. we spent several shining days picking them and were paid in cash for it. brinker was inspired to write his apple odeour choreis the coreof the warand the novelty and money of these days excited us. life at devon was revealed as s

oblems of the night before, that sleep suspended all but changed nothing, that you couldnt make yourself over between dawn and dusk. phineas however did not believe this. im sure that he looked down at his leg every morning first thing, as soon as he remembered it, to see if it had not been totally restored while he slept. when he found on this first morning back at devon that it happened still to be crippled and in a cast, he said in his usual self-contained way, hand me my crutches, will you?brinker hadley, next door, always awoke like an express train. there was a gathering rumble through the wall, as brinker reared up in bed, coughed hoarsely, slammed his feet on the floor, pounded through the freezing air to the closet for something in the way of clothes, and thundered down the hall to the bathroom. today, however, he veered and broke into our room instead.ready to sign up? he shouted before he was through the door. you ready to enfinny!you ready to enwhat? pursued finny from his bed. whos r

 over his chin, once removed.he wouldnt enlist with you, finny plunged in, if you were madame chiang kai-shek.well, i qualified in an undertone, he really is madame chiang kai-shek.well fan my brow, cried finny, giving us his stunned look of total appalled horrified amazement, who would have thought that! chinese. the yellow peril, right here at devon.and as far as the history of the class of 1943 at the devon school is concerned, this was the only part of our conversation worth preserving. brinker hadley had been tagged with a nickname at last, after four years of creating them for others and eluding one himself. yellow peril hadley swept through the school with the speed of a flu epidemic, and it must be said to his credit that brinker took it well enough except when, in its inevitable abbreviation, people sometimes called him yellow instead of peril.but in a week i had forgotten that, and i have never since forgotten the dazed look on finnys face when he thought that on the first day of his
