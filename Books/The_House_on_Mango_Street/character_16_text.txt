barrassed  it  took so  many  years.  the kids  who wanted  to 
be kids  instead of washing dishes and ironing their papa's 
shirts, and  the husband who wanted a  wife again. 

and then she died, my aunt who listened to my poems. 
and  then we  began  to dream the dreams. 

marilyn  monroe.... but  then  somebody  thought  it'd  be
 
better if we  chanred the game a little.  if we  pretended we
 
were mr.  benny, or his wife blanca, or ruthie, or anybody
 
we  knew. 

i don't know why we picked her. maybe we were bored 
that day.  maybe  we  rot  tired.  we  liked  my  aunt.  she  lis­
tened  to  our  stories.  she  always  asked  us  to  come  back. 
lucy, me, rachel.  i hated to go there alone. the six blocks 
to  the  dark  apartment,  second-floor  rear building where 
sunlight never came, and what did it matter? my  aunt was 
blind by  then. she  never saw  the dirty dishes in the sink. 
she couldn't see the ceilings dusty wit

what does it matter? 
they  never  saw  the  kitchenettes.  they  never  knew 
about  the  two-room  flats  and  sleeping  rooms  he  rented, 
the  weekly  money  orders  sent  home,  the  currency  ex­
change.  how could they? 

his  name was  geraldo.  and  his  home  is  in  another 
country. the ones he left behind are far away, will wonder, 
shrug.  remember.  geraldo-he  \itent  north ... we  never 
heard from  him again.

edna's ruthie 

ruthie, tall skinny lady with  red lipstick and blue ba­
bushka, one blue sock and one green because she forgot, 
is  the only grown-up we  know who likes to play. she takes 
her  dog  bobo  for  a  walk  and  laughs  all  by  herself,  that 
ruthie.  she doesn't  need  anybody  to  laugh with,  she just 
laughs. 

she  is  edna's  daughter,  the  lady  who  owns  the  big 
building next door, three apartments front and back. every 
week  edna  is  screaming  at  somebody,  and  every  week

somebody  has to  move  away.  once she threw out a  preg­
nant lady just because  she owned  a  duck ... and  it was  a 

r
 

nice duck too.  but ruthie lives  here and edna can't throw 
her out because  ruthie is  her daurhter. 

ruthie  came  one  day,  it  seemed,  out  of  nowhere. 
anrei  vargas was trying to teach  us  how  to whistle. then 
we heard someone whistling-beautiful like the emperor's 
nightingale-and  when  we  turned  around  there  was 
ruthie.

,  looking around  her like  a  wild  animal in  a  house  for  the 

sometimes we  go shopping and  take her with  us, but 
she never comes inside the stores and if she does she keeps 

first  time. 

she likes candy.  when we  go to mr.  benny's grocery 
she gives  us  money  to  buy  her some.  she says  make sure 
it's the soft kind because her teeth hurt. then she promises 
to  see  the dentist  next week,  but when  next week  comes, 
she doesn't go. 

ruthie sees lovely things

everywhere.  i might be tell­

ing her ajoke and she'll stop and say: the moon is beautiful 
like  a  balloon.  or somebody  might  be  singing and  she'll 
point to a  few  clouds:  look,  marlon  brando. or a sphinx 
winking.  or my  left shoe. 

once some friends of edna's came to visit  and asked 
ruthie if she wanted  to  go  with  them  to play  bingo.  the 
car  motor  was  running,  and  ruthie  stood  on  the  steps 
wondering whether to go. should  i go,  ma? she asked the 
gray shadow behind the second-roor screen.  i don't care, 
says  the  screen,  go  if  you  want.  ruthie  looked  at  the 
ground.  what do you  think,  ma?  do  what you want, how 
should  i  know?  ruthie  looked  at the ground  some  more. 
the  car  with  the  motor  runninr  waited  fifteen  minutes 
and then they left.  when we brought out the deck of cards 
that night,  we  let  ruthie deal.

sing and  dance  too.  she  had  lots  of job offers  when  she
 
was  young,  but she never took them.  she got married in­
stead  and  moved  away  to a  pretty house outside the city.
 
only  thing  i  can't understand  is  why  ruthie  is  living  on
 
mango street if she doesn't have to, why is she sleeping on!
 
a couch  in  her  mother's living  room  when  she  has a  real
 
house!  all  her own,  but she says she's just visiting and next 
weekend  her  husband's going  to  take  her home.  but the 
weekends come and go and  ruthie stays.  no  matter.  we
 
are glad because she is  our friend. 

i  like  showing  ruthie  the  books  i  take  out  of the 
library.  books  are  wonderful,  ruthie  says,  and  then  she

week.  i used to write children's books once, did  i tell you? 
one  day  i  memorized  all  of "the  walrus  and  the 
carpenter" because i wanted ruthie to hear me. "the sun 
was  shining  on  the  sea,  shining  with  all  his  might ..." 
ruthie looked at the sky  and her eyes got watery at times. 
finally  i  came  to  the  last  lines:  "but answer came  there 
none-and  this  was  scarcely  odd,  because  they'd  eaten 
everyone ..." she took a  long time looking at me before 
she  opened  her  mouth, and  then  she said,  you  have  the 
most beautiful teeth  i  have ever seen, and went inside.
