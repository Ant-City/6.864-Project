â€˜but he wields great dominion, nonetheless,â€™ said gimli; â€˜and now he will strike more swiftly.â€™

â€˜that we shall know if ever we come to erech,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜but the oath that they broke was to fight against sauron, and they must fight therefore, if they are to fulfil it. for at erech there stands yet a black stone that was brought, it was said, from nÃºmenor by isildur; and it was set upon a hill, and upon it the king of the mountains swore allegiance to him in the beginning of the realm of gondor. but when sauron returned and grew in might again, isildur summoned the men of the mountains to fulfil their oath, and they would not: for they had worshipped sauron in the dark years.

but as aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with legolas and gimli, and his companions had gone in. there came the lady Ã©owyn after him and called to him. he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the night, for she was clad in white; but her eyes were on fire.
â€˜aragorn,â€™ she said, â€˜why will you go on this deadly road?â€™
â€˜because i must,â€™ he said. â€˜only so can i see any hope of doing my part in the war against sauron. i do not choose paths of peril, Ã©owyn. were i to go where my heart dwells, far in the north i would now be wandering in the fair valley of rivendell.â€™
for a while she was silent, as if pondering what this might mean. then suddenly she laid her hand on his arm. â€˜you are a stern lord and resolute,â€™ she said; â€˜and thus do men win renown.â€™ she paused. â€˜lord.â€™ she said, â€˜if you must go, then let me ride in your following. for i am weary of skulking in the hills, and wish to face pe

â€˜but we must go in, and therefore the horses must go too,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜for if ever we come through this darkness, many leagues lie beyond, and every hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of sauron nearer. follow me!â€™
then aragorn led the way, and such was the strength of his will in that hour that all the dÃºnedain and their horses followed him. and indeed the love that the horses of the rangers bore for their riders was so great that they were willing to face even the terror of the door, if their mastersâ€™ hearts were steady as they walked beside them. but arod, the horse of rohan, refused the way, and he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was grievous to see. then legolas l

â€˜oathbreakers, why have ye come?â€™
and a voice was heard out of the night that answered him, as if from far away:
â€˜to fulfil our oath and have peace.â€™
then aragorn said: â€˜the hour is come at last. now i go to pelargir upon anduin, and ye shall come after me. and when all this land is clean of the servants of sauron, i will hold the oath fulfilled, and ye shall have peace and depart for ever. for i am elessar, isildurâ€™s heir of gondor.â€™
and with that he bade halbarad unfurl the great standard which he had brought; and behold! it was black, and if there was any device upon it, it was hidden in the darkness. then there was silence, and not a whisper nor a sigh was heard again all the long night. the company camped beside the stone, but they slept little, because of the dread of the shadows that hedged th

â€˜then, mithrandir, you had a foe to match you,â€™ said denethor. â€˜for myself, i have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the dark tower. is this all that you have returned to say? or can it be that you have withdrawn because you are overmatched?â€™

â€˜beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings,â€™ said gimli. â€˜but mighty indeed was aragorn that day. lo! all the black fleet was in his hands; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own, and he went up into it. then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken from the enemy; and the shadow host withdrew to the shore. there they stood silent, hardly to be se

â€˜concerning this thing, my lords, you now all know enough for the understanding of our plight, and of sauronâ€™s. if he regains it, your valour is vain, and his victory will be swift and complete: so complete that none can foresee the end of it while this world lasts. if it is destroyed, then he will fall; and his fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again. for he will lose the best part of the strength that was native to him in his beginning, and all that was made or b

â€˜i did so ere i rode from the hornburg,â€™ answered aragorn. â€˜i deemed that the time was ripe, and that the stone had come to me for just such a purpose. it was then ten days since the ring-bearer went east from rauros, and the eye of sauron, i thought, should be drawn out from his own land. too seldom has he been challenged since he returned to his tower. though if i had foreseen how swift would be his onset in answer, maybe i should not have dared to show myself. bare time was given me to come to your aid.â€™

â€˜as aragorn has begun, so we must go on. we must push sauron to his last throw. we must call out his hidden strength, so that he shall empty his land. we must march out to meet him at once. we must make ourselves the bait, though his jaws should close on us. he will take that bait, in hope and in greed, for he will think that in such rashness he sees the pride of the new ringlord: and he will say: â€œso! he pushes out his neck too soon and too far. let him come on, and behold i will have him in a trap from which he cannot escape. there i will crush him,

they were silent for a while. at length aragorn spoke. â€˜as i have begun, so i will go on. we come now to the very brink, where hope and despair are akin. to waver is to fall. let none now reject the counsels of gandalf, whose long labours against sauron come at last to their test. but for him all would long ago have been lost. nonetheless i do not yet claim to command any man. let others choose as they will.â€™
then said elrohir: â€˜from the north we came with this purpose, and from elrond our father we brought this very counsel. we will not turn back.â€™

â€˜come forth!â€™ they cried. â€˜let the lord of the black land come forth! justice shall be done upon him. for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor and wrested its lands. therefore the king of gondor demands that he should atone for his evils, and depart then for ever. come forth!â€™
there was a long silence, and from wall and gate no cry or sound was heard in answer. but sauron had already laid his plans, and he had a mind first to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill. so it was that, even as the captains were about to turn away, the silence was broken suddenly. there came a long rolling of great drums like thunder in the mountains, and then a braying of horns that shook the very stones and stunned menâ€™s ears. and thereupon the middle door of the black gate was thrown open with a great clang, and out of it there came an embassy from the dark tower.

â€˜so you have yet another of these imps with you!â€™ he cried. â€˜what use you find in them i cannot guess; but to send them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accustomed folly. still, i thank him, for it is plain that this brat at least has seen these tokens before, and it would be vain for you to deny them now.â€™
â€˜i do not wish to deny them,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜indeed, i know them all and all their history, and despite your scorn, foul mouth of sauron, you cannot say as much. but why do you bring them here?â€™
â€˜dwarf-coat, elf-cloak, blade of the downfallen west, and spy from the little rat-land of the shire-nay; do not start! we know it well - here are the marks of a conspiracy. now, maybe he that bore these things was a creature that you would not grieve to lose, and maybe otherwise: one dear to you, perhaps? if so, take swift counsel with what little wit is left to you. for sauron does not love spies, and what his fate shall be depends

â€˜these are the terms,â€™ said the messenger, and smiled as he eyed them one by one. â€˜the rabble of gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw at once beyond the anduin, first taking oaths never again to assail sauron the great in arms, open or secret. all lands east of anduin shall be sauronâ€™s for ever, solely. west of the anduin as far as the misty mountains and the gap of rohan shall be tributary to mordor, and men there shall bear no weapons, but shall have leave to govern their own affairs. but they shall help to rebuild isengard which they have wantonly destroyed, and that shall be sauronâ€™s, and there his lieutenant shall dwell: not saruman, but one more worthy of trust.â€™

â€™s eyes they read his thought. he was to be that lieutenant, and gather all that remained of the west under his sway; he would be their tyrant and they his slaves.
but gandalf said: â€˜this is much to demand for the delivery of one servant: that your master should receive in exchange what he must else fight many a war to gain! or has the field of gondor destroyed his hope in war, so that he falls to haggling? and if indeed we rated this prisoner so high, what surety have we that sauron the base master of treachery, will keep his part? where is this prisoner? let him be brought forth and yielded to us, and then we will consider these demands.â€™
it seemed then to gandalf, intent, watching him as a man engaged in fencing with a deadly foe, that for the taking of a breath the messenger was at a loss; yet swiftly he laughed again.
â€˜do not bandy words in your insolence with the mouth of sauron!â€™ he cried. â€˜surety you crave! sauron gives none. if you sue for his clemency you

â€˜these we will take!â€™ said gandalf suddenly. he cast aside his cloak and a white light shone forth like a sword in that black place. before his upraised hand the foul messenger recoiled, and gandalf coming seized and took from him the tokens: coat, cloak, and sword. â€˜these we will take in memory of our friend,â€™ he cried. â€˜but as for your terms, we reject them utterly. get you gone, for your embassy is over and death is near to you. we did not come here to waste words in treating with sauron, faithless and accursed; still less with one of his slaves. begone!â€™
then the messenger of mordor laughed no more. his face was twisted with amazement and anger to the likeness of some wild beast that, as it crouches on its prey, is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod. rage filled him and his mouth slavered, and shapeless sounds of fury came strangling from his throat. but he looked at the fell faces of the captains and their deadly eyes, and fear overcame his wrath. he gave a great cry

drums rolled and fires leaped up. the great doors of the black gate swung back wide. out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as swirling waters when a sluice is lifted.
the captains mounted again and rode back, and from the host of mordor there went up a jeering yell. dust rose smothering the air, as from nearby there marched up an army of easterlings that had waited for the signal in the shadows of ered lithui beyond the further tower. down from the hills on either side of

as he gazed at it suddenly sam understood, almost with a shock, that this stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of mordor, but to keep them in. it was indeed one of the works of gondor long ago, an eastern outpost of the defences of ithilien, made when, after the last alliance, men of westernesse kept watch on the evil land of sauron where his creatures still lurked. but as with narchost and carchost, the towers of the teeth, so here too the vigilance had failed, and treachery had yielded up the tower to the lord of the ringwraiths, and now for long years it had been held by evil things. since his return to mordor, sauron had found it useful; for he had few servants but many slaves of fear, and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escape from mordor. though if an enemy were so rash as to try to enter that land s

the hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly. such daylight as followed was dim; for here as the mountain drew near the air was ever mirky, while out from the dark tower there crept the veils of shadow that sauron wove about himself. frodo was lying on his back not moving. sam stood beside him, reluctant to speak, and yet knowing that the word now lay with him: he must set his masterâ€™s will to work for another effort. at length, stooping and caressing frodoâ€™s brow, he spoke in his ear.
â€˜wake up, master!â€™ he said. â€˜time for another start.â€™
as if roused by a sudden bell, frodo rose quickly, and stood up and looked away southwards; but when his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he quailed

the path was not put there for the purposes of sam. he did not know it, but he was looking at sauronâ€™s road from barad-dÃ»r to the sammath naur, the chambers of fire. out from the dark towerâ€™s huge western gate it came over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron, and then passing into the plain it ran for a league between two smoking chasms, and so reached a long sloping causeway that led up on to the mountainâ€™s eastern side. thence, turning and encircling all its wide girth from south to north, it climbed at last, high in the upper cone, but still far from the reeking summit, to a dark e

â€˜iâ€™ll crawl, sam,â€™ he gasped.
so foot by foot, like small grey insects, they crept up the slope. they came to the path and found that it was broad, paved with broken rubble and beaten ash. frodo clambered on to it, and then moved as if by some compulsion he turned slowly to face the east. far off the shadows of sauron hung; but torn by some gust of wind out of the world, or else moved by some great disquiet within, the mantling clouds swirled, and for a moment drew aside; and then he saw, rising black, blacker and darker than the vast shades amid which it stood, the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of barad-dÃ»r. one moment only it stared out, but as from some great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing eye; and then the shadows were fur

sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in. it was dark and hot, and a deep rumbling shook the air. â€˜frodo! master!â€™ he called. there was no answer. for a moment he stood, his heart beating with wild fears, and then he plunged in. a shadow followed him.
at first he could see nothing. in his great need he drew out once more the phial of galadriel, but it was pale and cold in his trembling hand and threw no light into that stifling dark. he was come to the heart of the realm of sauron and the forges of his ancient might, greatest in middle-earth; all other powers were here subdued. fearfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark, and then all at once there came a flash of red that leaped upward, and smote the high black roof. then sam saw that he was in a long cave or tunnel that bored into the mountainâ€™s smoking cone. but only a short way ahead its floor and the walls on either side were cloven by a great fissure, out of which the red glare came, now leaping up, now d

â€˜the realm of sauron is ended!â€™ said gandalf. â€˜the ring-bearer has fulfilled his quest.â€™ and as the captains gazed south to the land of mordor, it seemed to them that, black against the pall of cloud, there rose a huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, filling all the sky. enormous it reared above the world, and stretched out towards them a vast threatening hand, terrible but impotent: for even as it leaned over them, a great wind took it, and it was all blown away, and passed; and then a hush

â€˜the fourteenth of the new year,â€™ said gandalf; â€˜or if you like, the eighth day of april in the shire reckoning.Â« but in gondor the new year will always now begin upon the twenty-fifth of march when sauron fell, and when you were brought out of the fire to the king. he has tended you, and now he awaits you. you shall eat and drink with him. when you are ready i will lead you to him.â€™
