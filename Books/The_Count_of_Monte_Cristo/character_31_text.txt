â€œwillingly. your spanish wine is excellent. you see we were quite right
to pacify that country.â€

â€œyes; but don carlos?â€

â€œwell, don carlos will drink bordeaux, and in ten years we will marry
his son to the little queen.â€

â€œyou will then obtain the golden fleece, if you are still in the
ministry.â€

â€œi think, albert, you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke
this morning.â€

â€œwell, you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach; but i hear
beauchamp in the next room; you can dispute together, and that will pass
away the time.â€

â€œabout what?â€

â€œabout the papers.â€

â€œmy dear friend,â€ said lucien with an air of sovereign contempt, â€œdo i
ever read the papers?â€

â€œthen you will dispute the more.â€

â€œm. beauchamp,â€ announced the servant. â€œcome in, come in,â€ said albert,
rising and advancing to meet the young man. â€œhere is debray, who detests
you without reading you, so he says.â€

â€œhe is quite right,â€ returned b

â€œ_pardieu!_â€

â€œand what do they say of it in the world?â€

â€œin which world? we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838.â€

â€œin the entire political world, of which you are one of the leaders.â€

â€œthey say that it is quite fair, and that sowing so much red, you ought
to reap a little blue.â€

â€œcome, come, that is not bad!â€ said lucien. â€œwhy do you not join our
party, my dear beauchamp? with your talents you would make your fortune
in three or four years.â€

â€œi only await one thing before following your advice; that is, a
minister who will hold office for six months. my dear albert, one word,
for i must give poor lucien a respite. do we breakfast or dine? i must
go to the chamber, for our life is not an idle one.â€

â€œyou only breakfast; i await two persons, and the instant they arrive we
shall sit down to table.â€

â€œa gentleman, and a diplomatist.â€

â€œthen we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman, and three for
the diplomatist. i shall come back to dessert; keep me some
strawberries, coffee, and cigars. i shall take a cutlet on my way to the
chamber.â€

â€œdo not do anything of the sort; for were the gentleman a montmorency,
and the diplomatist a metternich, we will breakfast at eleven; in the
meantime, follow debrayâ€™s example, and take a glass of sherry and a

choice, as they say, at least, how could we choose that?â€

â€œi understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity.â€

â€œdo not run down m. danglarsâ€™ speeches,â€ said debray; â€œhe votes for you,
for he belongs to the opposition.â€

â€œ_pardieu_, that is exactly the worst of all. i am waiting until you
send him to speak at the luxembourg, to laugh at my ease.â€

â€œmy dear friend,â€ said albert to beauchamp, â€œit is plain that the
affairs of spain are settled, for you are most desperately out of humor
this morning. recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage
between myself and mlle. eugÃ©nie danglars; i cannot in conscience,
therefore, let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say
to me, â€˜vicomte, you know i give my daughter two millions.â€™â€

â€œah, this marriage will never take place,â€ said beauchamp. â€œthe king has
made him a baron, and can make him a peer, but

is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it. you have seven
martlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you will still have
four; that is one more than m. de guise had, who so nearly became king
of france, and whose cousin was emperor of germany.â€

â€œon my word, i think you are right, lucien,â€ said albert absently.

â€œto be sure; besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastard--that
is, he can be.â€

â€œdo not say that, debray,â€ returned beauchamp, laughing, â€œfor here is
chÃ¢teau-renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for paradoxes, will pass
the sword of renaud de montauban, his ancestor, through your body.â€

â€œhe will sully it then,â€ returned lucien; â€œfor i am low--very low.â€

â€œoh, heavens,â€ cried beauchamp, â€œthe minister quotes bÃ©ranger, what
shall we come to next?â€

announcing two fresh guests.

â€œnot worth speaking of?â€ cried chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œlife is not worth
speaking of!--that is rather too philosophical, on my word, morrel. it
is very well for you, who risk your life every day, but for me, who only
did so once----â€

â€œwe gather from all this, baron, that captain morrel saved your life.â€

â€œexactly so.â€

â€œon what occasion?â€ asked beauchamp.

â€œbeauchamp, my good fellow, you know i am starving,â€ said debray: â€œdo
not set him off on some long story.â€

â€œwell, i do not prevent your sitting down to table,â€ replied beauchamp,
â€œchÃ¢teau-renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast.â€

someone else.â€

â€œyou all know that i had the fancy of going to africa.â€

â€œit is a road your ancestors have traced for you,â€ said albert
gallantly.

â€œyes? but i doubt that your object was like theirs--to rescue the holy
sepulchre.â€

â€œyou are quite right, beauchamp,â€ observed the young aristocrat. â€œit was
only to fight as an amateur. i cannot bear duelling ever since two
seconds, whom i had chosen to arrange an affair, forced me to break the

â€œthatâ€™s why you want to purchase my english horse,â€ said debray, â€œyou

â€œyou are mistaken, for i have made a vow never to return to africa.â€

not all--after rescuing me from the sword, he rescued me from the cold,
not by sharing his cloak with me, like st. martin, but by giving me the
whole; then from hunger by sharing with me--guess what?â€

â€œno, his horse; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty
appetite. it was very hard.â€

â€œthe horse?â€ said morcerf, laughing.

â€œno, the sacrifice,â€ returned chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œask debray if he would
sacrifice his english steed for a stranger?â€

 said beauchamp; â€œthat is the way the academy mostly escapes from the
dilemma.â€

the question once, but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second
time.â€

â€œyes, and for a most curious one.â€

â€œgo on, then, for i see i shall not get to the chamber this morning, and

â€œthere are no bandits,â€ cried debray.

â€œyes there are, and most hideous, or rather most admirable ones, for i
found them ugly enough to frighten me.â€

â€œhe had not even a knitting-needle.â€

â€œbut he paid your ransom?â€

â€œhe said two words to the chief and i was free.â€

â€œjust so.â€

â€œwhy, he is a second ariosto.â€

â€œno, his name is the count of monte cristo.â€

â€œthere is no count of monte cristoâ€ said debray.

â€œi do not think so,â€ added chÃ¢teau-renaud, with the air of a man who
knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly.

â€œdoes anyone know anything of a count of monte cristo?â€

â€œhe comes possibly from the holy land, and one of his ancestors
possessed calvary, as the mortemarts did the dead sea.â€

â€œwhich means that my count of monte cristo is one of those fishermen. he
has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself sinbad the
sailor, and has a cave filled with gold.â€

â€œand you have seen this cavern, morcerf?â€ asked beauchamp.

â€œno, but franz has; for heavenâ€™s sake, not a word of this before him.
franz went in with his eyes blindfolded, and was waited on by mutes and
by women to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet. only he is not quite

hashish, so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of

â€œyes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating.â€

â€œhe must be a vampire.â€

debray; â€œfacial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead, livid

not of the same race.â€

â€œi am highly flattered,â€ returned beauchamp.

striking, albert.â€


â€œconfess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,â€
 continued beauchamp. but the sound of the clock had not died away when
germain announced, â€œhis excellency the count of monte cristo.â€ the
involuntary start everyone gave proved how much morcerfâ€™s narrative had
impressed them, and albert himself could not wholly refrain from
manifesting sudden emotion. he had not heard a carriage stop in the
street, or steps in the antechamber; the door had itself opened
noiselessly. the count appeared, dressed with the greatest simplicity,
but the most fastidious dandy could

e, and especially in france, where, it
seems, it is forbidden to beat the postilions.â€

â€œmy dear count,â€ replied albert, â€œi was announcing your visit to some of
my friends, whom i had invited in consequence of the promise you did me
the honor to make, and whom i now present to you. they are the count of
chÃ¢teau-renaud, whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers, and whose
ancestors had a place at the round table; m. lucien debray, private
secretary to the minister of the interior; m. beauchamp, an editor of a
paper, and the terror of the french government, but of whom, in spite of
his national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in italy, since his
paper is prohibited there; and m. maximilian morrel, captain of spahis.â€

at this name the count, who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy,
but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a pace
forward, and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks. â€œyou wear
the uniform of the new french conquerors, monsieur,â€
 
 ___________________________
 
ing color, and slight trembling of
the eyelid that show emotion. â€œah, you have a noble heart,â€ said the
count; â€œso much the better.â€ this exclamation, which corresponded to the
countâ€™s own thought rather than to what albert was saying, surprised
everybody, and especially morrel, who looked at monte cristo with
wonder. but, at the same time, the intonation was so soft that, however
strange the speech might seem, it was impossible to be offended at it.
â€œwhy should he doubt it?â€ said beauchamp to chÃ¢teau-renaud.


â€œin reality,â€ replied the latter, who, with his aristocratic glance and
his knowledge of the world, had penetrated at once all that was
penetrable in monte cristo, â€œalbert has not deceived us, for the count
is a most singular being. what say you, morrel!â€

â€œ_ma foi_, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in spite of
the singular remark he has made about me.â€

â€œgentlemen,â€ said albert, â€œgermain informs me that breakfast is ready.

my excuse for any improprieties i may commit. i am a stranger, and a
stranger to such a degree, that this is the first time i have ever been
at paris. the french way of living is utterly unknown to me, and up to
the present time i have followed the eastern customs, which are entirely
in contrast to the parisian. i beg you, therefore, to excuse if you find
anything in me too turkish, too italian, or too arabian. now, then, let
us breakfast.â€

â€œwith what an air he says all this,â€ muttered beauchamp; â€œdecidedly he
is a great man.â€

â€œa great man in his own country,â€ added debray.

â€œa great man in every country, m. debray,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud. the
count was, it may be remembered, a most temperate guest. albert remarked
this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the parisian mode of
life should displease the traveller in the most essential point. â€œmy
dear count,â€ said he, â€œi fear one thing, and that is, that the fare of
the rue du helder is not so much to your taste a

 â€œi make no secret of it. it is a
mixture of excellent opium, which i fetched myself from canton in order
to have it pure, and the best hashish which grows in the east--that is,
between the tigris and the euphrates. these two ingredients are mixed in
equal proportions, and formed into pills. ten minutes after one is
taken, the effect is produced. ask baron franz dâ€™epinay; i think he
tasted them one day.â€

â€œyes,â€ replied morcerf, â€œhe said something about it to me.â€

â€œbut,â€ said beauchamp, who, as became a journalist, was very
incredulous, â€œyou always carry this drug about you?â€

â€œalways.â€

â€œwould it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?â€
 continued beauchamp, hoping to take him at a disadvantage.

â€œno, monsieur,â€ returned the count; and he drew from his pocket a
marvellous casket, formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden
lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet
about the size of a pea. this ball had an

there were four or five more in the emerald, which would contain about a
dozen. the casket passed around the table, but it was more to examine
the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to
hand. â€œand is it your cook who prepares these pills?â€ asked beauchamp.

â€œoh, no, monsieur,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œi do not thus betray my
enjoyments to the vulgar. i am a tolerable chemist, and prepare my pills
myself.â€

â€œthis is a magnificent emerald, and the largest i have ever seen,â€ said
chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œalthough my mother has some remarkable family jewels.â€

â€œi had three similar ones,â€ returned monte cristo. â€œi gave one to the
sultan, who mounted it in his sabre; another to our holy father the
pope, who had it set in his tiara, opposi

â€œperhaps,â€ returned the count, smiling.

â€œmy dear count, you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you
speak thus,â€ said morcerf. â€œi had announced you beforehand to my friends
as an enchanter of the _arabian nights_, a wizard of the middle ages;
but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for
caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths, when these
truths do not form a part of their daily existence. for example, here is
debray who reads, and beauchamp who prints, every day, â€˜a member of the
jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard;â€™ â€˜four persons
have been assassinated in the rue st. denisâ€™ or â€˜the faubourg st.

justice, which is somewhat expeditious, and which would have been
particularly so with him; but i did nothing of the sort--i suffered him
and his band to depart.â€

â€œwith the condition that they should sin no more,â€ said beauchamp,
laughing. â€œi see they kept their promise.â€

â€œno, monsieur,â€ returned monte cristo â€œupon the simple condition that
they should respect myself and my friends. perhaps what i am about to
say may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt humanity and
your duty to your neighbor, but i never seek to protect a society which
does not protect me, and which i will even say, generally occupies

â€œhow have i deviated from those principles, monsieur?â€ asked monte

that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that
clear and piercing glance.

â€œwhy, it seems to me,â€ replied morrel, â€œthat in delivering m. de

society.â€

â€œof which he is the brightest ornament,â€ said beauchamp, drinking off a
glass of champagne.

â€œmy dear count,â€ cried morcerf, â€œyou are at fault--you, one of the most
formidable logicians i know--and you must see it clearly proved that
instead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist. ah, you call
yourself oriental, a levantine, maltese, indian, chinese; your family
name is monte cristo; sinbad the sailor is your baptismal appellation,

ere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to my betrothed-

â€œeugÃ©nie danglars,â€ said monte cristo; â€œtell me, is not her father baron
danglars?â€

â€œyes,â€ returned morcerf, â€œa baron of a new creation.â€

â€œwhat matter,â€ said monte cristo â€œif he has rendered the state services
which merit this distinction?â€

â€œenormous ones,â€ answered beauchamp. â€œalthough in reality a liberal, he
negotiated a loan of six millions for charles x., in 1829, who made him
a baron and chevalier of the legion of honor; so that he wears the
ribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but at his
button-hole.â€

â€œfaubourg saint-germain,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud. â€œthe count will find
there a charming hotel, with a court and garden.â€

â€œbah, chÃ¢teau-renaud,â€ returned debray, â€œyou only know your dull and
gloomy faubourg saint-germain; do not pay any attention to him, count--
live in the chaussÃ©e dâ€™antin, thatâ€™s the real centre of paris.â€

â€œboulevard de lâ€™opÃ©ra,â€ said beauchamp; â€œthe second floor--a house with
a balcony. the count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought
there, and as he smokes his chibouque, see all paris pass before him.â€

â€œ_parbleu!_ at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your
apartments, but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar
sum every day.â€

â€œit is not that which deterred me,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œbut as i
determined to have a house to myself, i sent on my valet de chambre, and
he ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it.â€

â€œbut you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows paris?â€ said
beauchamp.

â€œit is the first time he has ever been in paris. he is black, and cannot
speak,â€ returned monte cristo.

â€œit is ali!â€ cried albert, in the midst of the general surprise.

â€œyes, ali himself, my nubian mute, whom you saw, i think, at rome.â€

â€œcertainly,â€ said morcerf; â€œi recollect him perfectly. but how could you
charge a nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?--he will
do everything wrong.â€

â€œundeceive yourself, monsieur,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œi am qui

for me at nine at the barriÃ¨re de fontainebleau. he gave me this paper;
it contains the number of my new abode; read it yourself,â€ and monte
cristo passed a paper to albert.

â€œah, that is really original,â€ said beauchamp.

â€œand very princely,â€ added chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œwhat, do you not know your house?â€ asked debray.

â€œno,â€ said monte cristo; â€œi told you i did not wish to be behind my
time; i dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the viscountâ€™s
door.â€ the young men looked at each other; they did not know if it was a
comedy monte cristo was playing, but every word he uttered had such an
air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said was
false--besides, why should he

the theatres to him.â€

â€œthanks, monsieur,â€ returned monte cristo, â€œmy steward has orders to
take a box at each theatre.â€

â€œis your steward also a nubian?â€ asked debray.

â€œno, he is a countryman of yours, if a corsican is a countryman of any
oneâ€™s. but you know him, m. de morcerf.â€

constantinople; it cost me more, but i have nothing to fear.â€

â€œbut you forget,â€ replied debray, laughing, â€œthat we are franks by name
and franks by nature, as king charles said, and that the moment she puts
her foot in france your slave becomes free.â€

â€œwho will tell her?â€

â€œthe first person who sees her.â€

â€œshe only speaks romaic.â€

â€œthat is different.â€

â€œbut at least we shall see her,â€ said beauchamp, â€œor do you keep eunuchs
as well as mutes?â€

â€œoh, no,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œi do not carry brutalism so far.
everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when they leave me
will no longer have any need of me or anyone else; it is for that
reason, perhaps, that they do not quit me.â€ they had long since passed
to dessert and cigars.

is charming, but you leave the best company to go into the worst

â€œtake care,â€ returned albert; â€œno one has been able to accomplish that.â€

â€œoh, we have three millions for our police; it is true they are almost
always spent beforehand, but, no matter, we shall still have fifty
thousand francs to spend for this purpose.â€

â€œand when you know, will you tell me?â€

â€œi promise you. _au revoir_, albert. gentlemen, good morning.â€

as he left the room, debray called out loudly, â€œmy carriage.â€

â€œbravo,â€ said beauchamp to albert; â€œi shall not go to the chamber, but i
have something better to offer my readers than a speech of m. danglars.â€

â€œfor heavenâ€™s sake, beauchamp,â€ returned morcerf, â€œdo not deprive me of
the merit of introducing him everywhere. is he not peculiar?â€

â€œhe is more than that,â€ replied chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œhe is one of the most
extraordinary men i ever saw in my life. are you coming, morrel?â€

hÃ©loÃ¯se de villefort.

p.s.--do pray contrive some means for me to meet the count of monte
cristo at your house. i must and will see him again. i have just made m.
de villefort promise to call on him, and i hope the visit will be
returned.

that night the adventure at auteuil was talked of everywhere. albert
related it to his mother; chÃ¢teau-renaud recounted it at the jockey
club, and debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister;
even beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of
the countâ€™s courage and gallantry, thereby celebrating him as the
greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the
aristocracy. vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who
left their names at the residence of madame de villefort, with the
design of renewing their visit at the right moment, of hearing from her
lips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure.

he character of _bertram_, and, as
usual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite
composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience.
morcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his
orchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least
a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance;
he had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus box. chÃ¢teau-
renaud rented a stall beside his own, while beauchamp, as a journalist,
had unlimited range all over the theatre. it happened that on this
particular night the ministerâ€™s box was placed at the disposal of lucien
debray, who offered it to the comte de morcerf, who again, upon his
motherâ€™s rejection of it, sent it to danglars, with an intimation that
he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her
daughter during the evening, in the event of their accepting the box in
question. the ladies received the offer with too much

of victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the first
handsome woman you think of!â€

â€œand who has filled your head with all this nonsense?â€

â€œwhy, in the first place, i heard it from madame danglars, who, by the
by, is dying to see you in her box, or to have you seen there by others;
secondly, i learned it from beauchampâ€™s journal; and thirdly, from my
own imagination. why, if you sought concealment, did you call your horse
vampa?â€

â€œthat was an oversight, certainly,â€ replied the count; â€œbut tell me,
does the count of morcerf never visit the opera? i have been looking for
him, but without success.â€

â€œhe will be here tonight.â€

â€œin what part of the house?â€

â€œin the baronessâ€™s box, i believe.â€

â€œyes.â€

ed thousand francs, and that would teach her prudence.â€

â€œi do not understand,â€ stammered lucien.

â€œit is very clear, notwithstanding,â€ replied the young man, with an
artlessness wholly free from affectation; â€œtell her some fine morning an
unheard-of piece of intelligence--some telegraphic despatch, of which
you alone are in possession; for instance, that henri iv. was seen
yesterday at gabrielleâ€™s. that would boom the market; she will buy
heavily, and she will certainly lose when beauchamp announces the
following day, in his gazette, â€˜the report circulated by some usually
well-informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at gabrielleâ€™s
house, is totally without foundation. we can positively assert that his
majesty did not quit the pont-neuf.â€™â€ lucien half smiled. monte cristo,
although apparently indifferent, had not lost one word of this
conversation, and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret in
the embarrassed manner of the secretary. this embarrassment

deposited there, and now, after ten years of separation, her father and
mother were to be reunited with her.

the parisians, always curious, always affected by funereal display,
looked on with religious silence while the splendid procession
accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old
aristocracy--the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to
their principles.

in one of the mourning-coaches beauchamp, debray, and chÃ¢teau-renaud
were talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness. â€œi saw madame
de saint-mÃ©ran only last year at marseilles, when i was coming back from
algiers,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œshe looked like a woman destined to live
to be a hundred years old, from her apparent sound health and great
activity of mind and body. how old was she?â€

â€œfranz assured me,â€ replied albert, â€œthat she was sixty-six years old.
but she has not died of old age, but of grief; it a

ppears that since the
death of the marquis, which affected her very deeply, she has not
completely recovered her reason.â€

â€œbut of what disease, then, did she die?â€ asked debray.

â€œit is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which
is the same thing, is it not?â€

â€œnearly.â€

â€œit is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,â€ said beauchamp.
â€œmadame de saint-mÃ©ran, whom i once saw, was short, of slender form, and
of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could hardly
produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of madame de saint-
mÃ©ran.â€

â€œat any rate,â€ said albert, â€œwhatever disease or doctor may have killed
her, m. de villefort, or rather, mademoiselle valentine,--or, still
rather, our friend franz, inherits a magnificent fortune, amounting, i
believe, to 80,000 livres per annum.â€

â€œand this for

tune will be doubled at the death of the old jacobin,
noirtier.â€

â€œthat is a tenacious old grandfather,â€ said beauchamp. â€œ_tenacem
propositi virum_. i think he must have made an agreement with death to
outlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed. he resembles
the old conventionalist of â€˜93, who said to napoleon, in 1814, â€˜you bend
because your empire is a young stem, weakened by rapid growth. take the
republic for a tutor; let us return with renewed strength to the battle-
field, and i promise you 500,000 soldiers, another marengo, and a second

this man had seen valentine, and spoken to her! the young and high-
spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist breaking
his oath. he took the arm of chÃ¢teau-renaud, and turned towards the
vault, where the attendants had already placed the two coffins. â€œthis is
a magnificent habitation,â€ said beauchamp, looking towards the
mausoleum; â€œa summer and winter palace. you will, in turn, enter it, my
dear dâ€™epinay, for you will soon be numbered as one of the family. i, as
a philosopher, should like a little country-house, a cottage down there
under the trees, without so many free-stones over my poor body. in
dying, i will say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron: â€˜_eo
rus_, and all will be over.â€™ but come, franz, take courage, your wife is
an heiress.â€

â€œindeed, beauchamp, you

 are unbearable. politics has made you laugh at
everything, and political men have made you disbelieve everything. but
when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men, and the
pleasure of leaving politics for a moment, try to find your affectionate
heart, which you leave with your stick when you go to the chamber.â€


â€œbut tell me,â€ said beauchamp, â€œwhat is life? is it not a halt in
deathâ€™s anteroom?â€

â€œi am prejudiced against beauchamp,â€ said albert, drawing franz away,
and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with
debray. the villefort vault formed a square of white stones, about
twenty feet high; an interior partition separated the two families, and
each apartment had its entrance door. here were not, as in other tombs,
ignoble drawers, one above another, where thrift bestows its dead and
labels them like specimens in a museum; all that was visible within the
bronze gates was a gloomy-looking room,

the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their
reception in the right-hand crypt belonging to the saint-mÃ©ran family.
villefort, franz, and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary.

as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door, and
there was no address given, the party all separated; chÃ¢teau-renaud,
albert, and morrel, went one way, and debray and beauchamp the other.
franz remained with m. de villefort; at the gate of the cemetery, morrel
made an excuse to wait; he saw franz and m. de villefort get into the
same mourning coach, and thought this meeting forboded evil. he then
returned to paris, and although in the same carriage with chÃ¢teau-renaud
and albert, he did not hear one word of their conversation. as franz was
about to take leave of m. de villefort, â€œwhen shall i see you again?â€
 said the latter.

â€œat what time you please, sir,â€

that during the whole conversation morcerf had never once dared to ask
if it was on his own account that danglars recalled his word. that
evening he had a long conference with several friends; and m.
cavalcanti, who had remained in the drawing-room with the ladies, was
the last to leave the bankerâ€™s house.

the next morning, as soon as he awoke, danglars asked for the
newspapers; they were brought to him; he laid aside three or four, and
at last fixed on _lâ€™impartial_, the paper of which beauchamp was the
chief editor. he hastily tore off the cover, opened the journal with
nervous precipitation, passed contemptuously over the paris jottings,
and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence, stopped with a malicious
smile, at a paragraph headed

_we hear from yanina._

â€œvery good,â€ observed danglars, after having read the paragraph; â€œhere
is a little article on colonel fernand, which, if i am not mistaken,
would render the explanation which the comte de morcerf required of me

moments in some way or other. but come, i am waiting for you.â€ both men
entered monte cristoâ€™s carriage, which in the course of a few minutes
deposited them safely at no. 30. monte cristo took albert into his
study, and pointing to a seat, placed another for himself. â€œnow let us
talk the matter over quietly,â€ said the count.


â€œyou see i am perfectly composed,â€ said albert.

â€œwith whom are you going to fight?â€

â€œwith beauchamp.â€

â€œone of your friends!â€

â€œof course; it is always with friends that one fights.â€

â€œi suppose you have some cause of quarrel?â€

â€œi have.â€

â€œwhat has he done to you?â€

â€œthere appeared in his journal last night--but wait, and read for
yourself.â€ and albert handed over the paper to the count, who read as
follows:--

â€œa correspondent at yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we
had remained in ignorance. the castle which formed the protection of the
town was giv

 and the count of morcerf are one and the same person? and who
cares now about yanina, which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or
1823?â€

â€œthat just shows the meanness of this slander. they have allowed all
this time to elapse, and then all of a sudden rake up events which have
been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal, in order to tarnish the
lustre of our high position. i inherit my fatherâ€™s name, and i do not
choose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it. i am going to
beauchamp, in whose journal this paragraph appears, and i shall insist
on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses.â€

â€œbeauchamp will never retract.â€

â€œthen he must fight.â€

â€œno he will not, for he will tell you, what is very true, that perhaps
there were fifty officers in the greek army bearing the same name.â€

â€œwe will fight, nevertheless. i will efface that blot on my fatherâ€™s
character. my father, who was such a brave soldier, whose career was so
brilliant----â€

â€œoh, we

subject, if you remember, when we were at rome.â€

â€œnevertheless, my dear count, i found you this morning engaged in an
occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to
entertain.â€

â€œbecause, my dear fellow, you understand one must never be eccentric. if
oneâ€™s lot is cast among fools, it is necessary to study folly. i shall
perhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp, who
has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with beauchamp;
he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other, he will bring
his witnesses, or will insult me in some public place, and i am expected
to kill him for all that.â€

â€œyou admit that you would fight, then? well, if so, why do you object to
my doing so?â€

â€œi do not say that you ought not to fight, i only say that a duel is a
serious thing, and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection.â€

â€œdid he reflect before he insulted my father?â€

â€œif he spoke hastily, and owns

â€œ_ma foi!_ we live in times when there is much to which we must submit.â€

â€œthat is precisely the fault of the age.â€

â€œand do you undertake to reform it?â€

â€œyes, as far as i am personally concerned.â€

â€œwell, you are indeed exacting, my dear fellow!â€

â€œyes, i own it.â€

â€œare you quite impervious to good advice?â€

â€œnot when it comes from a friend.â€

â€œand do you account me that title?â€

â€œcertainly i do.â€

â€œwell, then, before going to beauchamp with your witnesses, seek further
information on the subject.â€

â€œfrom whom?â€

â€œfrom haydÃ©e.â€

â€œwhy, what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair?--what can
she do in it?â€

â€œshe can declare to you, for example, that your father had no hand
whatever in the defeat and death of the vizier; or if by chance he had,
indeed, the misfortune to----â€

â€œi have told you, my dear count, that i would not for one moment admit
of such a proposition.â€

â€œyou reject this means of

 information, then?â€

â€œi do--most decidedly.â€

â€œthen let me offer one more word of advice.â€

â€œdo so, then, but let it be the last.â€

â€œyou do not wish to hear it, perhaps?â€

â€œon the contrary, i request it.â€

â€œdo not take any witnesses with you when you go to beauchamp--visit him
alone.â€

â€œthat would be contrary to all custom.â€

â€œyour case is not an ordinary one.â€

â€œand what is your reason for advising me to go alone?â€

â€œbecause then the affair will rest between you and beauchamp.â€

â€œexplain yourself.â€

â€œi will do so. if beauchamp be disposed to retract, you ought at least
to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will,--the
satisfaction to you will be the same. if, on the contrary, he refuses to
do so, it will then be qu

ite time enough to admit two strangers into
your secret.â€

â€œthey will not be strangers, they will be friends.â€

â€œah, but the friends of today are the enemies of tomorrow; beauchamp,
for instance.â€

â€œso you recommend----â€

â€œi recommend you to be prudent.â€

â€œthen you advise me to go alone to beauchamp?â€

â€œi do, and i will tell you why. when you wish to obtain some concession
from a manâ€™s self-love, you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to
wound it.â€

â€œi believe you are right.â€

â€œi am glad of it.â€

â€œthen i will go alone.â€

â€œgo; but you would do better still by not going at all.â€

â€œthat is impossible.â€

â€œdo so, then; it will be a wiser plan than the first which you
proposed.â€

â€œbut if, in spite of all my precautions, i am at last obliged to fight,

 so, then.â€

â€œbut if i do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or
two in shooting and fencing?â€

â€œthat, too, is impossible.â€

â€œwhat a singular being you are!--you will not interfere in anything.â€

â€œyou are right--that is the principle on which i wish to act.â€

â€œwe will say no more about it, then. good-bye, count.â€ morcerf took his
hat, and left the room. he found his carriage at the door, and doing his
utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp, who was
in his office. it was a gloomy, dusty-looking apartment, such as
journalistsâ€™ offices have always been from time immemorial. the servant
announced m. albert de morcerf. beauchamp repeated the name to himself,
as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright, and then
gave orders for him to be admitted. albert entered. beauchamp uttered an
exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under
foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room. â€œ

man. â€œare you out of your senses, or do you come peaceably to take
breakfast with me? try and find a seat--there is one by that geranium,
which is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other
leaves in the world besides leaves of paper.â€

â€œbeauchamp,â€ said albert, â€œit is of your journal that i come to speak.â€

â€œindeed? what do you wish to say about it?â€

â€œi desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified.â€

â€œto what do you refer? but pray sit down.â€

â€œthank you,â€ said albert, with a cold and formal bow.

â€œwill you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement
which has displeased you?â€

â€œan announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of
my family.â€

â€œwhat is i

â€œthe story sent you from yanina.â€

â€œyanina?â€

â€œyes; really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings
me here.â€

â€œsuch is really the case, i assure you, upon my honor! baptiste, give me
yesterdayâ€™s paper,â€ cried beauchamp.

â€œhere, i have brought mine with me,â€ replied albert.

beauchamp took the paper, and read the article to which albert pointed
in an undertone. â€œyou see it is a serious annoyance,â€ said morcerf, when
beauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph. â€œis the officer
referred to a relation of yours, then?â€ demanded the journalist.

â€œyes,â€ said albert, blushing.

â€œwell, what do you wish me to do for you?â€ said beauchamp mildly.

â€œmy dear beauchamp, i wish you to contradict this statement.â€ beauchamp

attention than at first, the lines denounced by his friend. â€œwell,â€ said
albert in a determined tone, â€œyou see that your paper has insulted a
member of my family, and i insist on a retractation being made.â€

â€œyou insist?â€

â€œyes, i insist.â€

â€œpermit me to remind you that you are not in the chamber, my dear

convulsively, for he saw that beauchampâ€™s anger was beginning to rise,--
â€œyou have been my friend, and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to
be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this point.â€

â€œif i have been your friend, morcerf, your present manner of speaking
would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title. but wait a
moment, do not let us get angry, or at least not yet. you are irritated
and vexed--tell me how this fernand is related to you?â€

i can well understand your indignation, my dear albert. i will look at
it again;â€ and he read the paragraph for the third time, laying a stress
on each word as he proceeded. â€œbut the paper nowhere identifies this
fernand with your father.â€

â€œno; but the connection will be seen by others, and therefore i will
have the article contradicted.â€ at the words _i will_, beauchamp
steadily raised his eyes to albertâ€™s countenance, and then as gradually

increased though stifled anger.


â€œyes,â€ replied beauchamp.

â€œimmediately?â€ said albert.

â€œwhen i am convinced that the statement is false.â€

â€œwhat?â€

â€œthe thing is worth looking into, and i will take pains to investigate
the matter thoroughly.â€

â€œbut what is there to investigate, sir?â€ said albert, enraged beyond
measure at beauchampâ€™s last remark. â€œif you do not believe that it is my
father, say so immediately; and if, on the contrary, you believe it to
be him, state your reasons for doing so.â€ beauchamp looked at albert
with the smile which was so peculiar to him, and which in its numerous
modifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind. â€œsir,â€

â€œhad you continued to remain on amicable terms with me, i should have
said, â€˜patience, my friend;â€™ but you have constituted yourself my enemy,
therefore i say, â€˜what does that signify to me, sir?â€™â€

â€œwell, let it be three weeks then,â€ said morcerf; â€œbut remember, at the
expiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in----â€

â€œm. albert de morcerf,â€ said beauchamp, rising in his turn, â€œi cannot
throw you out of window for three weeks--that is to say, for twenty-four
days to come--nor have you any right to split my skull open till that
time has elapsed. today is the 29th of august; the 21st of september
will, therefore, be the conclusion of the term agreed on, and till that
time arrives--and it is the advice of a gentleman which i am about to
give you--till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two
dogs chained within sight of each other.â

€ when he had concluded his
speech, beauchamp bowed coldly to albert, turned his back upon him, and
went to the press-room.


albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers, which he sent flying
all over the office by switching them violently with his stick; after
which ebullition he departed--not, however, without walking several
times to the door of the press-room, as if he had half a mind to enter.
while albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner
that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his

 caderousse sighed deeply, and fell back with a groan. the blood no
longer flowed from his wounds. he was dead.

â€œ_one!_â€ said the count mysteriously, his eyes fixed on the corpse,
disfigured by so awful a death. ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and
the procureur arrived, the one accompanied by the porter, the other by
ali, and were received by the abbÃ© busoni, who was praying by the side
of the corpse.



chapter 84. beauchamp

the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation
throughout paris for the next fortnight. the dying man had signed a
deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin. the police had orders
to make the strictest search for the murderer. caderousseâ€™s knife, dark
lantern, bunch of keys, and clothing, excepting the waistcoat, which
could not be found, were deposited at the registry; the corpse was
conveyed to the morgue. the count told everyone that this adventure had
happened

th sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused to
listen, or to express a single doubt to the baron. the baron adored
count andrea cavalcanti: not so mademoiselle eugÃ©nie danglars. with an
instinctive hatred of matrimony, she suffered andreaâ€™s attentions in
order to get rid of morcerf; but when andrea urged his suit, she
betrayed an entire dislike to him. the baron might possibly have
perceived it, but, attributing it to a caprice, feigned ignorance.

the delay demanded by beauchamp had nearly expired. morcerf appreciated
the advice of monte cristo to let things die away of their own accord.
no one had taken up the remark about the general, and no one had
recognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of yanina the noble
count in the house of peers. albert, however felt no less insulted; the
few lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult.
besides, the manner in which beauchamp had closed the conference left a
bitter recollection in his heart. he 
 
 ___________________________
 
cherished the thought of the duel,
hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds. beauchamp had
not been seen since the day he visited albert, and those of whom the
latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would
detain him some days. where he was no one knew.

one morning albert was awakened by his valet de chambre, who announced
beauchamp. albert rubbed his eyes, ordered his servant to introduce him
into the small smoking-room on the ground floor, dressed himself
quickly, and went down. he found beauchamp pacing the room; on
perceiving him beauchamp stopped. â€œyour arrival here, without waiting my
visit at your house today, looks well, sir,â€ said albert. â€œtell me, may
i shake hands with you, saying, â€˜beauchamp, acknowledge you have injured
me, and retain my friendship,â€™ or must i simply propose to you a choice
of arms?â

â€œalbert,â€ said beauchamp, with a look of sorrow which stupefied the
young man, â€œlet us first sit down and talk.â€

â€œrather, sir, before we sit down, i must demand your answer.â€

â€œalbert,â€ said the journalist, â€œthese are questions which it is
difficult to answer.â€

â€œi will facilitate it by repeating the question, â€˜will you, or will you
not, retract?â€™â€

â€œmorcerf, it is not enough to answer â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜noâ€™ to questions which
concern the honor, the social interest, and the life of such a man

arm must save his life.â€

â€œwell,â€ said morcerf, impatiently, â€œwhat does all this mean?â€

â€œit means that i have just returned from yanina.â€

â€œfrom yanina?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œimpossible!â€

â€œhere is my passport; examine the visa--geneva, milan, venice, trieste,
delvino, yanina. will you believe the government of a republic, a
kingdom, and an empire?â€ albert cast his eyes on the passport, then
raised them in astonishment to beauchamp. â€œyou have been to yanina?â€
 said he.

â€œalbert, had you been a stranger, a foreigner, a simple lord, like that
englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since,
and whom i killed to get rid of, i should not have taken this trouble;
but i thought this mark of consideration due to you. i took a week to
go, another to return, four days of quarantine, and forty-eight hours to
stay there; that makes three weeks. i returned last night, and here i
am.â€

â€œbecause, in truth, albert----â€

â€œyou hesitate?â€

â€œyes,--i fear.â€

â€œyou fear to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you? oh,
no self-love, beauchamp. acknowledge it, beauchamp; your courage cannot
be doubted.â€

â€œnot so,â€ murmured the journalist; â€œon the contrary----â€

albert turned frightfully pale; he endeavored to speak, but the words
died on his lips. â€œmy friend,â€ said beauchamp, in the most affectionate
tone, â€œi should gladly make an apology; but, alas, ----â€

â€œbut what?â€

â€œthe paragraph was correct, my friend.â€

â€œwhat? that french officer----â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œfernand?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œthe traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he
was----â€

â€œpardon me, my friend, that man was your father!â€ albert advanced
furiously towards beauchamp, but the latter restrained him more by a
mild look than by his extended hand.

albert opened the paper, it was an attestation of four notable
inhabitants of yanina, proving that colonel fernand mondego, in the
service of ali tepelini, had surrendered the castle for two million
crowns. the signatures were perfectly legal. albert tottered and fell
overpowered in a chair. it could no longer be doubted; the family name
was fully given. after a momentâ€™s mournful silence, his heart
overflowed, and he gave way to a flood of tears. beauchamp, who had
watched with sincere pity the young manâ€™s paroxysm of grief, approached
him. â€œnow, albert,â€ said he, â€œyou understand me--do you not? i wished to
see all, and to judge of everything for myself, hoping the explanation
would be in your fatherâ€™s favor, and that i might do him justice. but,
on the contrary, the particulars which are given prove that fernand
mondego, raised by ali pasha to the rank of governor-general, is no
other than count fernand of morcerf; then, recollecting t

albert, still extended on the chair, covered his face with both hands,
as if to prevent the light from reaching him. â€œi hastened to you,â€
 continued beauchamp, â€œto tell you, albert, that in this changing age,
the faults of a father cannot revert upon his children. few have passed
through this revolutionary period, in the midst of which we were born,
without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the
soldier, or the gown of the magistrate. now i have these proofs, albert,
and i am in your confidence, no human power can force me to a duel which
your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal, but i come to

these attestations, which i alone possess, to be destroyed? do you wish
this frightful secret to remain with us? confided to me, it shall never
escape my lips; say, albert, my friend, do you wish it?â€

albert threw himself on beauchampâ€™s neck. â€œah, noble fellow!â€ cried he.

â€œtake these,â€ said beauchamp, presenting the papers to albert.

albert seized them with a convulsive hand, tore them in pieces, and
trembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to
confront him, he approached the wax-light, always kept burning for
cigars, and burned every fragment. â€œdear, excellent friend,â€ murmured
albert, still burning the papers.

â€œlet all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream,â€ said beauchamp; â€œlet it
vanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper, and disappear as the

â€œyes, yes,â€ said albert, â€œand may there remain only the eternal
friendship which i promised to my deliverer, which shall be transmitted
to our childrenâ€™s children, and shall always remind me that i owe my
life and the honor of my name to you,--for had this been known, oh,
beauchamp, i should have destroyed myself; or,--no, my poor mother! i
could not have killed her by the same blow,--i should have fled from my
country.â€

â€œdear albert,â€ said beauchamp. but this sudden and factitious joy soon
forsook the young man, and was succeeded by a still greater grief.

â€œwell,â€ said beauchamp, â€œwhat still oppresses you, my friend?â€


â€œi am broken-hearted,â€ said albert. â€œlisten, beauchamp! i cannot thus,
in a moment relinquish the respect, the confidence, and pride with which
a fatherâ€™s untarnished name inspires a son. oh, beauchamp, beauchamp,
how shall i now approach mine? shall i draw back my forehead from his
embrace, or withhold my h

and from his? i am the most wretched of men.
ah, my mother, my poor mother!â€ said albert, gazing through his tears at
his motherâ€™s portrait; â€œif you know this, how much must you suffer!â€

â€œcome,â€ said beauchamp, taking both his hands, â€œtake courage, my
friend.â€

â€œbut how came that first note to be inserted in your journal? some
unknown enemy--an invisible foe--has done this.â€

â€œthe more must you fortify yourself, albert. let no trace of emotion be
visible on your countenance, bear your grief as the cloud bears within
it ruin and death--a fatal secret, known only when the storm bursts. go,
my friend, reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall
come.â€

â€œi think nothing, my friend; but all things are possible. by the way----
â€œ

â€œwhat?â€ said albert, seeing that beauchamp hesitated.

â€œare you going to marry mademoiselle danglars?â€

â€œwhy do you ask me now?â€

â€œbecause the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with
the person of whom we were speaking.â€

â€œhow?â€ said albert, whose brow reddened; â€œyou think m. danglars----â€

â€œi ask you only how your engagement stands? pray put no construction on
my words i do not mean they should convey, and give them no undue
weight.â€

â€œno.â€ said albert, â€œthe engagement is broken off.â€

â€œwell,â€ said beauchamp. then, seeing the young man was about to relapse
into melancholy, â€œlet us go out, albert,â€ said he; â€œa ride in the wood
in the phaeton, or on horseback, will refresh you; we will then return
to breakfast, and you shall attend to your affairs, and i to mine.â€

â€œwillingly,â€ said albert; â€œbut let us walk. i think a little exertion
would do me good.â€ the two friends walked out on the fortress. when
arrived at the madeleine,--â€œsince we are out,â€ said beauchamp, â€œlet us
call on m. de monte cristo; he is admirably adapted to revive oneâ€™s
spirits, because he never interrogates, and in my opinion those who ask
no questions are the best comforters.â€

â€œgladly,â€ said albert; â€œi love him--let us call.â€



chapter 85. the journey

monte cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men
together. â€œah, ha!â€ said he, â€œi hope all is over, explained and
settled.â€

â€œyes,â€ said beauchamp; â€œthe absurd reports have died away, and

work.â€

â€œwhat is it?â€ said albert; â€œarranging your papers, apparently.â€

â€œmy papers, thank god, no,--my papers are all in capital order, because
i have none; but m. cavalcantiâ€™s.â€

â€œm. cavalcantiâ€™s?â€ asked beauchamp.

â€œyes; do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is
introducing?â€ said morcerf.

â€œlet us not misunderstand each other,â€ replied monte cristo; â€œi
introduce no one, and certainly not m. cavalcanti.â€

â€œand who,â€ said albert with a forced smile, â€œis to marry mademoiselle
danglars instead of me, which grieves me cruelly.â€

â€œwhat? cavalcanti is going to marry mademoiselle danglars?â€ asked
beauchamp.

â€œcertainly; do you come from the end of the world?â€ said m

match? no, you do not know me; i have done all in my power to oppose
it.â€

â€œah, i understand,â€ said beauchamp, â€œon our friend albertâ€™s account.â€

â€œon my account?â€ said the young man; â€œoh, no, indeed, the count will do
me the justice to assert that i have, on the contrary, always entreated
him to break off my engagement, and happily it is ended. the count
pretends i have not him to thank;--so be it--i will erect an altar _deo

albert? you look dull; are you, after all, unconsciously in love with

remedy to propose to you.â€

â€œsome provenÃ§al, it appears. m. de villefort heard of him at marseilles,
and m. danglars recollects having seen him. consequently, the procureur
is very active in the affair, and the prefect of police very much
interested; and, thanks to that interest, for which i am very grateful,
they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood, under

n the sound of a horse at full
speed on the high road made albert look up. he was disagreeably
surprised to see his own valet de chambre, whom he had not brought, that
he might not inconvenience monte cristo.


â€œflorentin here!â€ cried he, starting up; â€œis my mother ill?â€ and he
hastened to the door. monte cristo watched and saw him approach the
valet, who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket, containing a
newspaper and a letter. â€œfrom whom is this?â€ said he eagerly. â€œfrom m.
beauchamp,â€ replied florentin.

â€œdid he send you?â€

â€œyes, sir; he sent for me to his house, gave me money for my journey,
procured a horse, and made me promise not to stop till i had reached
you, i have come in fifteen hours.â€

albert opened the letter with fear, uttered a shriek on reading the
first line, and seized the paper. his sight was dimmed, his legs sank
under him, and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him.

â€œpoor young man,â€ said monte cristo in a low voice; â€œit i

read, he threw back his head, saying, â€œflorentin, is your horse fit to
return immediately?â€

â€œit is a poor lame post-horse.â€

â€œin what state was the house when you left?â€

â€œall was quiet, but on returning from m. beauchampâ€™s, i found madame in
tears; she had sent for me to know when you would return. i told her my
orders from m. beauchamp; she first extended her arms to prevent me, but
after a momentâ€™s reflection, â€˜yes, go, florentin,â€™ said she, â€˜and may he
come quickly.â€™â€

â€œyes, my mother,â€ said albert, â€œi will return, and woe to the infamous
wretch! but first of all i must get there.â€

he went back to the room where he had left monte cristo. five minutes

ly disappeared, read as follows:--

â€œthe french officer in the service of ali pasha of yanina alluded to
three weeks since in _lâ€™impartial_, who not only surrendered the castle
of yanina, but sold his benefactor to the turks, styled himself truly at
that time fernand, as our esteemed contemporary states; but he has since
added to his christian name a title of nobility and a family name. he
now calls himself the count of morcerf, and ranks among the peers.â€

thus the terrible secret, which beauchamp had so generously destroyed,
appeared again like an armed phantom; and another paper, deriving its
information from some malicious source, had published two days after
albertâ€™s departure for normandy the few lines which had rendered the
unfortunate young man almost crazy.



chapter 86. the trial

at eight oâ€™clock in the morning albert had arrived at beauchampâ€™s door.
the valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once.
beauchamp was in his bath. â€œhere i am,â€ said albert.

â€œwell, my poor friend,â€ replied beauchamp, â€œi expected you.â€

â€œi need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken
of that painful circumstance. your having sent for me is another proof
of your affection. so, without losing time, tell me, have you the
slightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds?â€

â€œi think i have some clew.â€

â€œbut first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot.â€ beauchamp
proceeded to relate to the young man, who was overwhelmed with shame and
grief, the following facts. two days previously, the article had
appeared in another paper besides _ lâ€™impartial_, and, what was more
serious, one that was well known as a government paper. beauchamp was
breakfasting when he read the paragraph. he sent immediately for a
cabriolet, and hastened to the publisherâ€™s office. although professing
diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other
paper, b

eauchamp--as it sometimes, we may say often, happens--was his
intimate friend. the editor was reading, with apparent delight, a
leading article in the same paper on beet-sugar, probably a composition
of his own.

â€œah, _pardieu!_â€ said beauchamp, â€œwith the paper in your hand, my
friend, i need not tell you the cause of my visit.â€

â€œare you interested in the sugar question?â€ asked the editor of the
ministerial paper.

â€œno,â€ replied beauchamp, â€œi have not considered the question; a totally
different subject interests me.â€

â€œwhat is it?â€

â€œthe article relative to morcerf.â€

â€œindeed? is it not a curious affair?â€

â€œso curious, that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution
for defamation of character.â€

â€œnot at all; we have received with the information all the requisite
proofs, and we are quite sure m. de morcerf will not raise his voice
against us; besides, it is rendering a service to oneâ€™s countr

denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed
on them.â€ beauchamp was thunderstruck. â€œwho, then, has so correctly
informed you?â€ asked he; â€œfor my paper, which gave the first information
on the subject, has been obliged to stop for want of proof; and yet we
are more interested than you in exposing m. de morcerf, as he is a peer
of france, and we are of the opposition.â€

â€œoh, that is very simple; we have not sought to scandalize. this news
was brought to us. a man arrived yesterday from yanina, bringing a
formidable array of documents; and when we he

accusatory article, he told us it should be inserted in some other
paper.â€

beauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit, and left the
office to despatch a courier to morcerf. but he had been unable to send
to albert the following particulars, as the events had transpired after
the messengerâ€™s departure; namely, that the same day a great agitation
was manifest in the house of peers among the usually calm members of
that dignified assembly. everyone had arrived almost before the usual
hour, and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract
the attentio

twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought
forward by morcerf. the investigation would begin at eight oâ€™clock that
evening in the committee-room, and if postponement were necessary, the
proceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour. morcerf
asked leave to retire; he had to collect the documents he had long been
preparing against this storm, which his sagacity had foreseen.

albert listened, trembling now with hope, then with anger, and then
again with shame, for from beauchampâ€™s confidence he knew his father was
guilty, and he asked himself how, since he was guilty, he could prove
his innocence. beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative. â€œwhat
next?â€ asked albert.

â€œwhat next? my friend, you impose a painful task on me. must you know
all?â€

â€œabsolutely; and rather from your lips than anotherâ€™s.â€

â€œmuster up all your courage, then, for never have you required it more.â€
 albert passed his hand over his forehead, as if to try his strength, as

count, â€˜so great was ali pashaâ€™s confidence, that on his death-bed he
resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care.â€™â€ albert
started on hearing these words; the history of haydÃ©e recurred to him,
and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring, and
the manner in which she had been sold and made a slave. â€œand what effect
did this discourse produce?â€ anxiously inquired albert. â€œi acknowledge
it affected me, and, indeed, all the committee also,â€ said beauchamp.

â€œmeanwhile, the president carelessly opened the letter which had been
brought to him; but the first lines aroused his attention; he read them
again and again, and fixing his eyes on m. de morcerf, â€˜count,â€™ said he,
â€˜you have said that the vizier of yanina confided his wife and daughter
to your care?â€™--â€˜yes, sir,â€™ replied morcerf; â€˜but in that, like all the

replied the president. â€˜is the committee willing to hear this witness?â€™-
-â€™yes, yes,â€™ they all said at once. the door-keeper was called. â€˜is
there anyone in the lobby?â€™ said the president.

â€œâ€˜yes, sir.â€™--â€˜who is it?â€™--â€˜a woman, accompanied by a servant.â€™
everyone looked at his neighbor. â€˜bring her in,â€™ said the president.
five minutes after the door-keeper again appeared; all eyes were fixed
on the door, and i,â€ said beauchamp, â€œshared the general expectation and
anxiety. behind the door-keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large
veil, which completely concealed her. it was evident, from her figure
and the perfumes she had about her, that she was young and fastidious in
her tastes, but that was all. the president requested her to throw aside
her veil, and it was then seen that she was dressed in the grecian
costume, and was remarkably beautiful.â€

â€œah,â€ said albert, â€œit was she.â€

â€œwho?â€

â€œhaydÃ©e.â

€

â€œwho told you that?â€

â€œalas, i guess it. but go on, beauchamp. you see i am calm and strong.
and yet we must be drawing near the disclosure.â€

â€œm. de morcerf,â€ continued beauchamp, â€œlooked at this woman with
surprise and terror. her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or
death. to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious,
that the interest they had felt for the countâ€™s safety became now quite
a secondary matter. the president himself advanced to place a seat for
the young lady; but she declined availing herself of it. as for the
count, he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs refused
to support him.

â€œâ€˜madame,â€™ said

ason, and conduct unbecoming a member of this house?â€™--â€˜yes,â€™ replied
all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice.

â€œhaydÃ©e had remained until the close of the meeting. she heard the
countâ€™s sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or
pity; then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the
councillors, and left with that dignified step which virgil attributes
to his goddesses.â€



chapter 87. the challenge

then,â€ continued beauchamp, â€œi took advantage of the silence and the
darkness to leave the house without being seen. the usher who had
introduced me was waiting for me at the door, and he conducted me
through the corridors to a private entrance opening into the rue de
vaugirard. i left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight. excuse
me, albert,--sorrow on your account, and delight with that noble girl,
thus pursuing paternal vengeance. yes, albert, from whatever source the
blow may have proceeded--it may be from an

 enemy, but that enemy is only
the agent of providence.â€ albert held his head between his hands; he
raised his face, red with shame and bathed in tears, and seizing
beauchampâ€™s arm, â€œmy friend,â€ said he, â€œmy life is ended. i cannot
calmly say with you, â€˜providence has struck the blow;â€™ but i must
discover who pursues me with this hatred, and when i have found him i
shall kill him, or he will kill me. i rely on your friendship to assist
me, beauchamp, if contempt has not banished it from your heart.â€

â€œcontempt, my friend? how does this misfortune affect you? no, happily
that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for
the fatherâ€™s actions. review your life, albert; although it is only just
beginning, did a lovely summerâ€™s day ever dawn with greater purity than
has marked the commencement of your career? no, albert, take my advice.

of excitement and changing tastes. you will return after three
or four years with a russian princess for a bride, and no one will think
more of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years
ago.â€

â€œthank you, my dear beauchamp, thank you for the excellent feeling which
prompts your advice; but it cannot be. i have told you my wish, or
rather my determination. you understand that, interested as i am in this
affair, i cannot see it in the same light as you do. what appears to you
to emanate from a celestial source, seems to me to proceed from one far
less pure. providence appears to me to have no share in this affair; and
happily so, for instead of the invisible, impalpable agent of celestial
rewards and punishments, i

 shall find one both palpable and visible, on
whom i shall revenge myself, i assure you, for all i have suffered
during the last month. now, i repeat, beauchamp, i wish to return to
human and material existence, and if you are still the friend you
profess to be, help me to discover the hand that struck the blow.â€

â€œbe it so,â€ said beauchamp; â€œif you must have me descend to earth, i
submit; and if you will seek your enemy, i will assist you, and i will
engage to find him, my honor being almost as deeply interested as
yours.â€

â€œwell, then, you understand, beauchamp, that we begin our search
immediately. each momentâ€™s delay is an eternity for me. the calumniator
is not yet punished, and he may hope that he will not be; but, on my
honor, if he thinks so, he deceives himself.â€

â€œwell, listen, morcerf.â€

â€œoh, yes, if it be true,â€ cried the young man, â€œhe shall pay me all i
have suffered.â€

â€œbeware, morcerf, he is already an old man.â€

â€œi will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family; if
my father had offended him, why did he not attack him personally? oh,
no, he was afraid to encounter him face to face.â€

â€œi do not condemn you, albert; i only restrain you. act prudently.â€

â€œoh, do not fear; besides, you will accompany me. beauchamp, solemn
transactions should be sanctioned by a witness. before this day closes,
if m. danglars is guilty, he shall cease to live, or i shall die.
_pardieu_, beauchamp, mine shall be a splendid funeral!â€

â€œwhen such resolutions are made, albert, they should be promptly
executed. do you wish to go to m. danglars? let us go immediately.â€ they
sent for a cabriolet. on entering the bankerâ€™s mansion, they perceived
the phaeton and servant of m. andrea cavalcanti.

danglars will not fight with me, i will kill his son-in-law; cavalcanti
will certainly fight.â€ the servant announced the young man; but the
banker, recollecting what had transpired the day before, did not wish
him admitted. it was, however, too late; albert had followed the
footman, and, hearing the order given, forced the door open, and
followed by beauchamp found himself in the bankerâ€™s study. â€œsir,â€ cried
the latter, â€œam i no longer at liberty to receive whom i choose in my
house? you appear to forget yourself sadly.â€

â€œno, sir,â€ said albert, coldly; â€œthere are circumstances in which one
cannot, except through cowardice,--i offer you that refuge,--refuse to
admit certain persons at least.â€

â€œwhat is your errand, then, with me, sir?â€

â€œi mean,â€ said albert, drawing near, and without apparently noticing
cavalcanti, who sto

he, â€˜write to yanina.â€™â€

â€œand who thus advised you?â€

â€œno other than your friend, monte cristo.â€

â€œthe count of monte cristo told you to write to yanina?â€

â€œyes; and i wrote, and will show you my correspondence, if you like.â€
 albert and beauchamp looked at each other. â€œsir,â€ said beauchamp, who
had not yet spoken, â€œyou appear to accuse the count, who is absent from
paris at this moment, and cannot justify himself.â€

â€œi accuse no one, sir,â€ said danglars; â€œi relate, and i will repeat
before the count what i have said to you.â€

â€œdoes the count know what answer you received?â€

â€œyes; i showed it to him.â€

â€œdid he know my fatherâ€™s christian name was fernand, and his family name

doubtless, warned the young girl, in the few romaic words he spoke to
her, not to implicate morcerfâ€™s father). besides, had he not begged of
morcerf not to mention his fatherâ€™s name before haydÃ©e? lastly, he had
taken albert to normandy when he knew the final blow was near. there
could be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged;
monte cristo then was in league with his fatherâ€™s enemies. albert took
beauchamp aside, and communicated these ideas to him.

â€œyou are right,â€ said the latter; â€œm. danglars has only been a secondary
agent in this sad affair, and it is of m. de monte cristo that you must
demand an explanation.â€ albert turned. â€œsir,â€ said he to danglars,
â€œunderstand that i do not take a final leave of you; i must ascertain if
your insinuations are just, and am going now to inquire of the count of

chapter 88. the insult

at the bankerâ€™s door beauchamp stopped morcerf. â€œlisten,â€ said he; â€œjust
now i told you it was of m. de monte cristo you must demand an
explanation.â€

â€œyes; and we are going to his house.â€

â€œreflect, morcerf, one moment before you go.â€

â€œon what shall i reflect?â€

â€œon the importance of the step you are taking.â€

â€œis it more serious than going to m. danglars?â€

â€œyes; m. danglars is a money-lover, and those who love money, you know,
think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a

duel.
the other is, on the contrary, to all appearance a true nobleman; but do
you not fear to find him a bully?â€

â€œi only fear one thing; namely, to find a man who will not fight.â€

â€œdo not be alarmed,â€ said beauchamp; â€œhe will meet you. my only fear is
that he will be too strong for you.â€

â€œmy friend,â€ said morcerf, with a sweet smile, â€œthat is what i wish. the
happiest thing that could occur to me, would be to die in my fatherâ€™s
stead; that would save us all.â€

â€œyour mother would die of grief.â€

â€œmy poor mother!â€ said albert, passing his hand across his eyes, â€œi know
she would; but better so than die of shame.â€

â€œare you quite decided, albert?â€

â€œyes; let us go.â€

â€œbut d

o you think we shall find the count at home?â€

â€œhe intended returning some hours after me, and doubtless he is now at
home.â€ they ordered the driver to take them to no. 30 champs-Ã©lysÃ©es.
beauchamp wished to go in alone, but albert observed that as this was an
unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual
etiquette of duels. the cause which the young man espoused was one so
sacred that beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes; he yielded
and contented himself with following morcerf. albert sprang from the
porterâ€™s lodge to the steps. he was received by baptistin. the count
had, indeed, just arrived, but he was in his bath, and had forbidden
that anyone should be admitted. â€œbut after his bath?â€ asked morcerf.

â€œmy master will go to dinner.â€

â€œand after dinner?â€

â€œhe will sleep an hour.â€

â€œthen?â€

â€œhe is going to the opera.â€

â€œare you sure of it?â€ as

ked albert.

â€œquite, sir; my master has ordered his horses at eight oâ€™clock
precisely.â€

â€œvery good,â€ replied albert; â€œthat is all i wished to know.â€ then,
turning towards beauchamp, â€œif you have anything to attend to,
beauchamp, do it directly; if you have any appointment for this evening,
defer it till tomorrow. i depend on you to accompany me to the opera;
and if you can, bring chÃ¢teau-renaud with you.â€

beauchamp availed himself of albertâ€™s permission, and left him,
promising to call for him at a quarter before eight. on his return home,
albert expressed his wish to franz debray, and morrel, to see them at
the opera that evening. then he went to see his mother, who since the
events of the day before had refused to see anyone, and had kept her
room. he found her in bed, overwhelmed with grief at this public
humiliation. the sight of albert produced the effect which might
naturally be expected on mercÃ©
 
 ___________________________
 
d he did not hear, bowed to
his mother, and quitted her. scarcely had he shut her door, when
mercÃ©dÃ¨s called a confidential servant, and ordered him to follow albert
wherever he should go that evening, and to come and tell her immediately
what he observed. then she rang for her ladyâ€™s maid, and, weak as she
was, she dressed, in order to be ready for whatever might happen. the
footmanâ€™s mission was an easy one. albert went to his room, and dressed
with unusual care. at ten minutes to eight beauchamp arrived; he had
seen chÃ¢teau-renaud, who had promised to be in the orchestra before the
curtain was raised. both got into albertâ€™s _coupÃ©_; and, as the young
man had no reason to conceal where he was going, he called aloud, â€œto
the opera.â€ in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the
performance.


chÃ¢teau-renaud was at his post; apprised by beauchamp of the
circumstances, he required no explanation from albert. the conduct of
the son in seeking to avenge his father was so 
 
 ___________________________
 
natural that chÃ¢teau-
renaud did not seek to dissuade him, and was content with renewing his
assurances of devotion. debray was not yet come, but albert knew that he
seldom lost a scene at the opera. albert wandered about the theatre
until the curtain was drawn up. he hoped to meet with m. de monte cristo
either in the lobby or on the stairs. the bell summoned him to his seat,
and he entered the orchestra with chÃ¢teau-renaud and beauchamp. but his
eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns, which remained
obstinately closed during the whole of the first act. at last, as albert
was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time, at the beginning
of the second act the door opened, and monte cristo entered, dressed in
black, and, leaning over the front of the box, looked around the pit.
morrel followed him, and looked also for his sister and brother in-law;
he soon discovered them in another box, and kissed his hand to th

not noticing albert, he did not, however, lose
sight of him, and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act, he
saw him leave the orchestra with his two friends. then his head was seen
passing at the back of the boxes, and the count knew that the
approaching storm was intended to fall on him. he was at the moment
conversing cheerfully with morrel, but he was well prepared for what
might happen. the door opened, and monte cristo, turning round, saw
albert, pale and trembling, followed by beauchamp and chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œwell,â€ cried he, with that benevolent politeness which distinguished
his salutation from the common civilities of the world, â€œmy cavalier has
attained his object. good-evening, m. de morcerf.â€ the countenance of
this man, who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings,
expressed the most perfect cordiality. morrel only then recollected the
letter he had received from the viscount, in which, without assigning
any reason, he begged him to go to the opera
 
 ___________________________
 
â€œi see you wish to quarrel with
me; but i would give you one piece of advice, which you will do well to
keep in mind. it is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge.
display is not becoming to everyone, m. de morcerf.â€

at this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of
spectators of this scene. they had talked of no one but morcerf the
whole day. albert understood the allusion in a moment, and was about to
throw his glove at the count, when morrel seized his hand, while
beauchamp and chÃ¢teau-renaud, fearing the scene would surpass the limits
of a challenge, held him back. but monte cristo, without rising, and
leaning forward in his chair, merely stretched out his arm and, taking
the damp, crushed glove from the clenched hand of the young man, â€œsir,â€
 said he in a solemn tone, â€œi consider your glove thrown, and will return
it to you wrapped around a bullet. now leave me or i will summon my
servants to throw you out at the door.â€

singing that line,--


â€˜o mathilde! idole de mon Ã¢me!â€™

â€œi was the first to discover duprez at naples, and the first to applaud
him. bravo, bravo!â€ morrel saw it was useless to say more, and
refrained. the curtain, which had risen at the close of the scene with
albert, again fell, and a rap was heard at the door.

â€œcome in,â€ said monte cristo with a voice that betrayed not the least
emotion; and immediately beauchamp appeared. â€œgood-evening, m.
beauchamp,â€ said monte cristo, as if this was the first time he had seen
the journalist that evening; â€œbe seated.â€

beauchamp bowed, and, sitting down, â€œsir,â€ said he, â€œi just now
accompanied m. de morcerf, as you saw.â€

â€œand that means,â€ replied monte cristo, laughing, â€œthat you had,
probably, just dined together. i am happy to see, m. beauchamp, that you
are more sober than he was.â€

having done so, entirely on my own account, be it understood, i would
add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some
explanation concerning your connection with yanina. then i will add two
words about the young greek girl.â€ monte cristo motioned him to be
silent. â€œcome,â€ said he, laughing, â€œthere are all my hopes about to be
destroyed.â€

â€œhow so?â€ asked beauchamp.

â€œdoubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character. i am,
in your opinion, a lara, a manfred, a lord ruthven; then, just as i am
arriving at the climax, you defeat your own end, and seek to make an
ordinary man of me. you bring me down to your own level, and demand
explanations! indeed, m. beauchamp, it is quite laughable.â€

â€œi am, sir, a living guaranty,â€ replied monte cristo, motionless, but
with a threatening look; â€œwe have both blood in our veins which we wish
to shed--that is our mutual guaranty. tell the viscount so, and that

â€œit is quite immaterial to me,â€ said monte cristo, â€œand it was very
unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle. in france
people fight with the sword or pistol, in the colonies with the carbine,
in arabia with the dagger. tell your client that, although i am the

â€œsure to gain!â€ repeated beauchamp, looking with amazement at the count.

â€œcertainly,â€ said monte cristo, slightly shrugging his shoulders;
â€œotherwise i would not fight with m. de morcerf. i shall kill him--i
cannot help it. only by a single line this evening at my house let me
know the arms and the hour; i do not like to be kept waiting.â€

â€œpistols, then, at eight oâ€™clock, in the bois de vincennes,â€ said
beauchamp, quite disconcerted, not knowing if he was dealing with an
arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being.

â€œvery well, sir,â€ said monte cristo. â€œnow all that is settled, do let me
see the performance, and tell your friend albert not to come any more
this evening; he will hurt himself with all his ill-chosen barbarisms:
let him go home and go to sleep.â€ beauchamp left the box, perfectly
amazed. â€œnow,â€ said monte cristo, turning towards morrel, â€œi may depend

â€œthank you, morrel.â€ then ringing the bell once, â€œlook.â€ said he to ali,
who came immediately, â€œtake that to my solicitor. it is my will, morrel.

â€œwhat?â€ said morrel, â€œyou dead?â€

â€œyes; must i not be prepared for everything, dear friend? but what did
you do yesterday after you left me?â€

â€œi went to tortoniâ€™s, where, as i expected, i found beauchamp and
chÃ¢teau-renaud. i own i was seeking them.â€

â€œwhy, when all was arranged?â€

â€œlisten, count; the affair is serious and unavoidable.â€

â€œdid you doubt it!â€

â€œno; the offence was public, and everyone is already talking of it.â€

â€œwell?â€

â€œwell, i hoped to get an exchange of arms,--to substitute the sword for
the pistol; the pistol is blind.â€

â€œhave you succeeded?â€ asked monte cristo quickly, with an imperceptible
gleam of hope.

â€œno; for your skill with the sword

moreover, do not alarm yourself, morrel; this weakness, if it is such,
is betrayed to you alone. i know the world is a drawing-room, from which
we must retire politely and honestly; that is, with a bow, and our debts
of honor paid.â€

â€œthat is to the purpose. have you brought your arms?â€

â€œi?--what for? i hope these gentlemen have theirs.â€

â€œi will inquire,â€ said morrel.

â€œdo; but make no treaty--you understand me?â€

â€œyou need not fear.â€ morrel advanced towards beauchamp and chÃ¢teau-
renaud, who, seeing his intention, came to meet him. the three young men
bowed to each other courteously, if not affably.

â€œexcuse me, gentlemen,â€ said morrel, â€œbut i do not see m. de morcerf.â€

â€œhe sent us word this morning,â€ replied chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œthat he would
meet us on the ground.â€

â€œah,â€ said morrel. beauchamp pulled out his watch. â€œit is only five
minutes past eight,â€ said he to morrel; â€œthere is not much time lost
yet.â€

â€œoh, i made no allu

sion of that kind,â€ replied morrel.

â€œthere is a carriage coming,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud. it advanced rapidly
along one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were
assembled. â€œyou are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen? m. de
monte cristo yields his right of using his.â€

â€œwe had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count,â€ said
beauchamp, â€œand i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten
days since, thinking to want them on a similar occasion. they are quite
new, and have not yet been used. will you examine them.â€

â€œoh, m. beauchamp, if you assure me that m. de morcerf does not know
these pistols, you may readily believe that your word will be quite
sufficient.â€

â€œgentlemen,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œit is not morcerf coming in that
carriage;--faith, it is franz and debray!â€ the two young men he

ed were indeed approaching. â€œwhat chance brings you here,
gentlemen?â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, shaking hands with each of them.
â€œbecause,â€ said debray, â€œalbert sent this morning to request us to
come.â€ beauchamp and chÃ¢teau-renaud exchanged looks of astonishment. â€œi
think i understand his reason,â€ said morrel.

â€œwhat is it?â€

â€œyesterday afternoon i received a letter from m. de morcerf, begging me
to attend the opera.â€

â€œand i,â€ said debray.

â€œand i also,â€ said franz.

â€œand we, too,â€ added beauchamp and chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œhaving wished you all to witness the challenge, he now wishes you to be
present at the combat.â€

â€œexactly so,â€ said the young men; â€œyou have probably

 guessed right.â€

â€œbut, after all these arrangements, he does not come himself,â€ said
chÃ¢teau-renaud. â€œalbert is ten minutes after time.â€

â€œthere he comes,â€ said beauchamp, â€œon horseback, at full gallop,
followed by a servant.â€

â€œhow imprudent,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œto come on horseback to fight a
duel with pistols, after all the instructions i had given him.â€

â€œand besides,â€ said beauchamp, â€œwith a collar above his cravat, an open
coat and white waistcoat! why has he not painted a spot upon his heart?-
-it would have been more simple.â€ meanwhile albert had arrived within
ten paces of the group formed by the five young men. he jumped from his
horse, threw the bridle on his servantâ€™s arms, and joined them. he was
pale, and his eyes were red and swollen; it was evident that he had not
slept. a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance, which
was not natural to him

â€œsir,â€ said maximilian, â€œyou are not perhaps aware that i am m. de monte

â€œi was not sure, but i thought it might be so. so much the better; the
more honorable men there are here the better i shall be satisfied.â€

â€œm. morrel,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œwill you apprise the count of monte

 morrel was preparing to fulfil his commission. beauchamp had meanwhile
drawn the box of pistols from the carriage. â€œstop, gentlemen,â€ said
albert; â€œi have two words to say to the count of monte cristo.â€

â€œin private?â€ asked morrel.

â€œno, sir; before all who are here.â€

albertâ€™s witnesses looked at each other. franz and debray exchanged some
words in a whisper, and morrel, rejoiced at this unexpected incident,
went to fetch the count, who was walking in a retired path with
emmanuel. â€œwhat does he want with me?â€ said monte cristo.

should entertain a false opinion of me,â€ added he, drawing himself up as
if he would challenge both friends and enemies, â€œi shall endeavor to
correct his mistake.â€

â€œwhat happened during the night?â€ asked beauchamp of chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œwe
appear to make a very sorry figure here.â€

â€œin truth, what albert has just done is either very despicable or very
noble,â€ replied the baron.

â€œwhat can it mean?â€ said debray to franz. â€œthe count of monte cristo

renaud, or of any of that group; but he thought of that courageous woman
who had come to plead for her sonâ€™s life, to whom he had offered his,
and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful family secret,
capable of destroying forever in that young manâ€™s heart every feeling of
filial piety.

the emissary of god!â€

young men with a melancholy
and dignified smile, and got into his carriage with maximilian and
emmanuel. albert, beauchamp, and chÃ¢teau-renaud remained alone. albert
looked at his two friends, not timidly, but in a way that appeared to
ask their opinion of what he had just done.

â€œindeed, my dear friend,â€ said beauchamp first, who had either the most
feeling or the least dissimulation, â€œallow me to congratulate you; this
is a very unhoped-for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair.â€

albert remained silent and wrapped in thought. chÃ¢teau-renaud contented
himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane. â€œare we not
going?â€ said he, after this embarrassing silence. â€œwhen you please,â€
 replied beauchamp; â€œallow me only to compliment m. de morcerf, who has
given proof today of rare chivalric

generosity.â€

â€œoh, yes,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œit is magnificent,â€ continued beauchamp, â€œto be able to exercise so
much self-control!â€

â€œassuredly; as for me, i should have been incapable of it,â€ said
chÃ¢teau-renaud, with most significant coolness.

â€œgentlemen,â€ interrupted albert, â€œi think you did not understand that
something very serious had passed between m. de monte cristo and
myself.â€

â€œpossibly, possibly,â€ said beauchamp immediately; â€œbut every simpleton
would not be able to understand your heroism, and sooner or later you
will find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically
than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your
life. may i give you a friendly counsel? set out for naples, the hague,
or st. petersburg--calm countries, where the point of honor is better
understood than among our hot-headed parisians. seek quietude and
oblivion, so that you may return peaceably

â€œthat is quite my opinion,â€ said the gentleman; â€œnothing induces serious
duels so much as a duel forsworn.â€

â€œthank you, gentlemen,â€ replied albert, with a smile of indifference; â€œi
shall follow your advice--not because you give it, but because i had
before intended to quit france. i thank you equally for the service you
have rendered me in being my seconds. it is deeply engraved on my heart,
and, after what you have just said, i remember that only.â€ chÃ¢teau-
renaud and beauchamp looked at each other; the impression was the same
on both of them, and the tone in which morcerf had just expressed his
thanks was so determined that the position would have become
embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued.

â€œgood-bye, albert,â€ said beauchamp suddenly, carelessly extending his
hand to the young man. the latter did not appear to arouse from his
lethargy; in fact, he did not notice the offered hand. â€œgood-bye,â€ said
chÃ¢teau-renaud in his turn, keeping his li

bad taste of decorations, which had only their richness to boast of,
shone in its splendor. mademoiselle eugÃ©nie was dressed with elegant
simplicity in a figured white silk dress, and a white rose half
concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament, unaccompanied by
a single jewel. her eyes, however, betrayed that perfect confidence
which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire. madame
danglars was chatting at a short distance with debray, beauchamp, and
chÃ¢teau-renaud.

debray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony, but on the
same plane with everyone else, and without any particular privilege. m.
danglars, surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue, was
explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the
course of events had compelled the government to call him into the
ministry. andrea, on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies
of the opera, was explaining to him rather cleverly,

occasion, and which he could alter as might be required. at twelve
oâ€™clock the mourning-coaches rolled into the paved court, and the rue du
faubourg saint-honorÃ© was filled with a crowd of idlers, equally pleased
to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich, and who rush
with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a
duchess.

gradually the reception-room filled, and some of our old friends made
their appearance--we mean debray, chÃ¢teau-renaud, and beauchamp,
accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar, in literature,
or the army, for m. de villefort moved in the first parisian circles,
less owing to his social position than to his personal merit. the cousin
standing at the door ushered in the guests, and it was rather a relief
to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves, and who did
not exact a mournful face or force tears, as would have been the case
with a father, a brother, or a lover. those who were acquainted soon

formed into little groups. one of them was made of debray, chÃ¢teau-
renaud, and beauchamp.

â€œpoor girl,â€ said debray, like the rest, paying an involuntary tribute
to the sad event,--â€œpoor girl, so young, so rich, so beautiful! could
you have imagined this scene, chÃ¢teau-renaud, when we saw her, at the
most three weeks ago, about to sign that contract?â€

â€œindeed, no,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud--â€œdid you know her?â€

â€œi spoke to her once or twice at madame de morcerfâ€™s, among the rest;
she appeared to me charming, though rather melancholy. where is her
stepmother? do yo

u know?â€

â€œshe is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is
receiving us.â€


â€œwho is he?â€

â€œwhom do you mean?â€

â€œthe gentleman who receives us? is he a deputy?â€

â€œoh, no. i am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day,â€ said
beauchamp; â€œbut he is perfectly unknown to me.â€

â€œhave you mentioned this death in your paper?â€

â€œit has been mentioned, but the article is not mine; indeed, i doubt if
it will please m. villefort, for it says that if four successive deaths
had happened anywhere else than in the house of the kingâ€™s attorney, he
would have interested himself somewhat more about it.â€

â€œstill,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œdr. dâ€™avrigny, who attends my mother,
declares he is in despair about it. but whom are

 you seeking, debray?â€

â€œi am seeking the count of monte cristoâ€ said the young man.

â€œi met him on the boulevard, on my way here,â€ said beauchamp. â€œi think
he is about to leave paris; he was going to his banker.â€

â€œhis banker? danglars is his banker, is he not?â€ asked chÃ¢teau-renaud of
debray.

â€œi believe so,â€ replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. â€œbut monte
cristo is not the only one i miss here; i do not see morrel.â€

â€œmorrel? do they know him?â€ asked chÃ¢teau-renaud. â€œi think he has only
been introduced to madame de villefort.â€

â€œstill, he ought to have been here,â€ said debray; â€œi wonder what wil

talked about tonight; this funeral is the news of the day. but hush,
here comes our minister of justice; he will feel obliged to make some
little speech to the cousin,â€ and the three young men drew near to
listen. beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the
funeral he had met monte cristo, who was directing his steps towards the
rue de la chaussÃ©e dâ€™antin, to m. danglarsâ€™.

the banker saw the carriage of the count enter the courtyard, and
advanced to meet him with a sad, though affable smile. â€œwell,â€ said he,
extending his hand to monte cristo, â€œi suppose you have come to
sympathize with me, for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my
house. when i perceived you, i was just asking

iscourse, some deploring this premature death, others
expatiating on the grief of the father, and one very ingenious person
quoting the fact that valentine had solicited pardon of her father for
criminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall--until at length
they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches.

monte cristo heard and saw nothing, or rather he only saw morrel, whose
calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in
his heart. â€œsee,â€ said beauchamp, pointing out morrel to debray. â€œwhat
is he doing up there?â€ and they called chÃ¢teau-renaudâ€™s attention to
him.

â€œhow pale he is!â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, shuddering.

â€œhe is cold,â€ said debray.

â€œnot at all,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, slowly; â€œi think he is violently
agitated. he is very susceptible.â€

â€œbah,â€ said debray; â€œhe scarcely knew mademoiselle de villefort; you
said so yourself.â€


â€œtrue. still i remember he danced three times with her at madame de

wing of what or to
whom he was speaking, so much was he occupied in watching morrel, who
was holding his breath with emotion. â€œthe discourse is over; farewell,
gentlemen,â€ said the count. and he disappeared without anyone seeing
whither he went. the funeral being over, the guests returned to paris.
chÃ¢teau-renaud looked for a moment for morrel; but while they were
watching the departure of the count, morrel had quitted his post, and
chÃ¢teau-renaud, failing in his search, joined debray and beauchamp.

monte cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the
arrival of morrel, who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by
spectators and workmen. morrel threw a glance around, but before it
reached the spot occupied by monte cristo the latter had advanced yet
nearer, still unperceived. the young man knelt down. the count, with
outstretched neck and glaring eyes, stood in an attitude ready to pounce
upon morrel upon the first occasion. morrel bent his head till it

â€œmy father--i will know who my father is,â€ said the obstinate youth; â€œi
will perish if i must, but i _will_ know it. what does scandal signify
to me? what possessions, what reputation, what â€˜pull,â€™ as beauchamp
says,--have i? you great people always lose something by scandal,
notwithstanding your millions. come, who is my father?â€

â€œi came to tell you.â€

â€œah,â€ cried benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy. just then the door
opened, and the jailer, addressing himself to bertuccio, said,--â€œexcuse
me, sir, but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner.â€

â€œand so closes our interview,â€ said andrea to the worthy steward; â€œi
wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil!â€

it was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short
summer; the clouds which m. de villefort had perceived at sunrise had
all disappeared as if by magic, and one of the softest and most
brilliant days of september shone forth in all its splendor.

beauchamp, one of the kings of the press, and therefore claiming the
right of a throne everywhere, was eying everybody through his monocle.
he perceived chÃ¢teau-renaud and debray, who had just gained the good
graces of a sergeant-at-arms, and who had persuaded the latter to let
them stand before, instead of behind him, as they ought to have done.
the worthy sergeant had recognized the ministerâ€™s secretary and the
millionnaire, and, by way of paying extra attention to his noble
neighbors, promised to k

eep their places while they paid a visit to
beauchamp.

â€œwell,â€ said beauchamp, â€œwe shall see our friend!â€

â€œyes, indeed!â€ replied debray. â€œthat worthy prince. deuce take those
italian princes!â€

â€œa man, too, who could boast of dante for a genealogist, and could
reckon back to the _divine comedy_.â€

â€œa nobility of the rope!â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud phlegmatically.

â€œhe will be condemned, will he not?â€ asked debray of beauchamp.

â€œmy dear fellow, i think we should ask you that question; you know such
news much better than we do. did you see the president at the ministerâ€™s
last night?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œwhat did he say?â€

â€œsomething which will surprise you.â€

â€œoh, make haste and tell me, then; it is a long time since that has
happened.â€

â€œwell, he told me that benedetto, who is considered a serpent of
subtlety and a giant of cunning, is really but a very commonplace, silly
rascal, and altogether unworth

his phrenological organs after his death.â€

â€œbah,â€ said beauchamp, â€œhe played the prince very well.â€

â€œyes, for you who detest those unhappy princes, beauchamp, and are
always delighted to find fault with them; but not for me, who discover a
gentleman by instinct, and who scent out an aristocratic family like a
very bloodhound of heraldry.â€

â€œthen you never believed in the principality?â€

â€œyes.--in the principality, but not in the prince.â€

â€œnot so bad,â€ said beauchamp; â€œstill, i assure you, he passed very well
with many people; i saw him at the ministersâ€™ houses.â€

â€œah, yes,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud. â€œthe idea of thinking minis

â€œthere is something in what you have just said,â€ said beauchamp,
laughing.

â€œbut,â€ said debray to beauchamp, â€œif i spoke to the president, _you_
must have been with the procureur.â€

â€œit was an impossibility; for the last week m. de villefort has secluded
himself. it is natural enough; this strange chain of domestic
afflictions, followed by the no less strange death of his daughter----â€

â€œstrange? what do you mean, beauchamp?â€

â€œoh, yes; do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the
ministerâ€™s?â€ said beauchamp, placing his eye-glass in his eye, where he
tried to make it remain.

â€œmy dear sir,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œallow me to tell you that you do
not understand that manÅ“uvre with the eye-glass half so well as debray.
give him a lesson, debray.â€

â€œstay,â€ said beauchamp, â€œsurely i am not deceived.â€

â€œwhat is it?â€

â€œit is she!â€

â€œwhom do you mean?â€

â€œthey said she had

â€œmademoiselle eugÃ©nie?â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œhas she returned?â€

â€œno, but her mother.â€

â€œmadame danglars? nonsense! impossible!â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œonly ten
days after the flight of her daughter, and three days from the
bankruptcy of her husband?â€

debray colored slightly, and followed with his eyes the direction of
beauchampâ€™s glance. â€œcome,â€ he said, â€œit is only a veiled lady, some
foreign princess, perhaps the mother of cavalcanti. but you were just
speaking on a very interesting topic, beauchamp.â€

â€œi?â€

â€œyes; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of valentine.â€

â€œah, yes, so i was. but how is it that madame de villefort is not here?â€

â€œpoor, dear woman,â€ said debray, â€œshe is no doubt occupied in distilling
balm for the hospitals, or in making cosmetics for herself or frie

do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year in this
amusement? but i wonder she is not here. i should have been pleased to
see her, for i like her very much.â€

â€œand i hate her,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œwhy?â€

â€œi do not know. why do we love? why do we hate? i detest her, from
antipathy.â€

â€œor, rather, by instinct.â€

â€œperhaps so. but to return to what you were saying, beauchamp.â€

â€œwell, do you know why they die so multitudinously at m. de
villefortâ€™s?â€

â€œâ€˜multitudinouslyâ€™ is good,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œmy good fellow, youâ€™ll find the word in saint-simon.â€

â€œbut the thing itself is at m. de villefortâ€™s; but letâ€™s get back to the
subject.â€

â€œtalking of that,â€ said debray, â€œmadame was making inquiries about that
house, which for the last three months has been hung with black.â€

â€œwho is madame?â€ asked chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œthe

â€œoh, your pardon! i never visit ministers; i leave that to the princes.â€

â€œreally, you were only before sparkling, but now you are brilliant; take
compassion on us, or, like jupiter, you will wither us up.â€

â€œi will not speak again,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud; â€œpray have compassion
upon me, and do not take up every word i say.â€

â€œcome, let us endeavor to get to the end of our story, beauchamp; i told
you that yesterday madame made inquiries of me upon the subject;
enlighten me, and i will then communicate my information to her.â€

â€œwell, gentlemen, the reason people die so multitudinously (i like the
word) at m. de villefortâ€™s is that there is an assassin in the house!â€
 the two young men shuddered, for the same idea had more than once
occurred to them.

â€œand who is the assassin;â€ they asked together.

â€œyoung edward!â€ a burst of laughter from the auditors did not in t

displeasure, so he poured out three drops of his elixir--three drops
were sufficient; then followed barrois, the old servant of m. noirtier,
who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch--he therefore received the
same quantity of the elixir; the same happened to valentine, of whom he
was jealous; he gave her the same dose as the others, and all was over
for her as well as the rest.â€

â€œwhy, what nonsense are you telling us?â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud.

â€œyes, it is an extraordinary story,â€ said beauchamp; â€œis it not?â€

â€œit is absurd,â€ said debray.

â€œah,â€ said beauchamp, â€œyou doubt me? well, you can ask my servant, or
rather him who will no longer be my servant tomorrow, it was the talk of
the house.â€

â€œand this elixir, where is it? what is it?â€

â€œthe child conceals it.â€

â€œbut where did he find it?â€

â€œin his motherâ€™s laboratory.â€

â€œdoes his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?â€

â€œhow can i tell? you are questioning me like a kingâ€™s attorney. i on

the poor devil would eat nothing, from fear.â€

â€œit is incredible!â€

â€œno, my dear fellow, it is not at all incredible. you saw the child pass
through the rue richelieu last year, who amused himself with killing his
brothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept.
the generation who follow us are very precocious.â€

â€œcome, beauchamp,â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œi will bet anything you do not
believe a word of all you have been telling us.â€

â€œi do not see the count of monte cristo here.â€

â€œhe is worn out,â€ said debray; â€œbesides, he could not well appear in
public, since he has been the dupe of the cavalcanti, who, it appears,
presented themselves to him with false letters of credit, and cheated
him out of 100,000 francs upon the hypothesis of this principality.â€

â€œby the way, m. de chÃ¢teau-renaud,â€ asked

beauchamp, â€œhow is morrel?â€

â€œ_ma foi_, i have called three times without once seeing him. still, his
sister did not seem uneasy, and told me that though she had not seen him
for two or three days, she was sure he was well.â€

â€œah, now i think of it, the count of monte cristo cannot appear in the
hall,â€ said beauchamp.

â€œwhy not?â€

â€œbecause he is an actor in the drama.â€

â€œhas he assassinated anyone, then?â€

â€œno, on the contrary, they wished to assassinate him. you know that it
was in leaving his house that m. de caderousse was murdered by his
friend benedetto. you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his
house, containing the letter which stopped the signature of the
marriage-contract. do you see the waistcoat? there it is, all blood-
stained, on the desk, as a testimony of the crime.â€

and as he spoke these words with a hoarse, choking voice, he staggered
towards the door, which was mechanically opened by a door-keeper. the
whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and
confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which
had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian world.

â€œwell,â€ said beauchamp, â€œlet them now say that drama is unnatural!â€

â€œ_ma foi!_â€ said chÃ¢teau-renaud, â€œi would rather end my career like m.
de morcerf; a pistol-shot seems quite delightful compared with this
catastrophe.â€

â€œand moreover, it kills,â€ said beauchamp.

â€œand to think that i had an idea of marrying his daughter,â€ said debray.
â€œshe did well to die, poor girl!â€

â€œthe sitting is adjourned, gentlemen,â€ said the president; â€œfresh
inquiries will be made, and the case will be tried
