me. grasping more firmly his newspaper-wrapped notebook and his tin can lunch of
cornbread and oil sausages, he continued to concentrate on the dusty road. he lagged several feet behind my other brothers,
stacey and christopher-john, and me, attempting to keep the rusty mississippi dust from swelling with each step and drifting
back upon his shiny black shoes and the cuffs of his corduroy pants by lifting each foot high before setting it gently down
again. always meticulously neat, six-year old little man never allowed dirt or tears or stains to mar anything he owned.
today was no exception.
'you keep it up and make us late for school, mama's gonna wear you out.' i threatened, pulling with exasperation at the high
collar of the sunday dress mama had made me wear for the first day of school - as if that event were something special. it
seemed to me that showing up at school at all on a bright august-like october morning made for running the cool forest trails
and wading barefoot in the forest pond

out it.'
'she did !'
'yeah, and you should've seen the way she look when she come outa that house.'
'how'd she look!' inquired little man, interested enough to glance up from the road for the first time.
t.j. looked around grimly and whispered. 'like... death.' he waited a moment for his words to be appropriately shocking, but
the effect was spoiled by little man, who asked lightly, 'what does death look like !' 
t.j. turned in annoyance. 'don't he know nothin'!'
'well, what does it look like?' little man demanded to know. he didn't like t.j. either, 'like my grandfather looked jus' 'fore
they buried him, t.j. described all-knowingly.
'oh.' replied little man, losing interest and concentrating on the road again.
'i tell ya. stacey, man,' said t.j. morosely, shaking his head. 'sometimes i jus' don't know 'bout that family of yours.
stacey pulled back, considering whether or not t.j.'s words were offensive. but t.]. immediately erased the question by
continuing amiably. 'don't get me wrong, stacey.

 got out of it though.
when mama asked me 'bout it, i jus' said ole claude was always sneakin' up there to get some of that free candy mr. kaleb
give out sometimes and i had to go and get him 'cause i knowed good and well she didn't want us up there. boy, did he get
it?' t.j. laughed. 'mama 'bout wore him out.
i stared at quiet claude. 'you let him do that!' i exclaimed. but claude only smiled in that sickly way of his and i knew that
he had. he was more afraid of t.j. than of his mother.
again little man glanced up and i could see his dislike for t.j. growing. friendly christopher-john glared at t.j., and
putting his short arm around claude's shoulder said. 'come on, claude. let's go on ahead.' then he and claude hurried up the
road, away from t.j.
stacey, who generally overlooked t.j.'s underhanded stunts, shook his head. 'that was dirty. 'well, what'd ya expect me to
do! i couldn't let her think i was g-oin' up there 'cause i like to, could i! she' d've killed me!'
'and good riddance.' i thoug

we were nearing the second crossroads, where deep gullies lined both sides of the road and the dense forest crept to the very
edges of high. jagged, clay-walled banks. suddenly, stacey turned, 'quick!' he cried. 'off the road!' without another word, all
of us but little man scrambled up the steep right bank into the forest.
'get up here, man.' stacey ordered, but little man only gazed at the ragged red bank sparsely covered with scraggly brown
briars and kept on walking .'come on, do like i say.
'but i'll get my clothes dirty i' protested little man. 'you're gonna get them a whole lot dirtier you stay down there. look!'
little man turned around and watched saucer-eyed as a bus bore down on him spewing clouds of red dust like a huge yellow
dragon breathing fire. little man headed toward the bank, but it was too steep. he ran frantically along the road looking for a

foothold and, finding one, hopped onto the bank, but not before the bus had sped past enveloping him in a scarlet haze while
laughing white faces pressed against the bus windows.
little man shook a threatening fist into the thick air, then looked dismally down at himself.
'well, ole little man done got his sunday clothes dirty, t.j. laughed as we jumped down from the bank. angry tears welled
in little man's eyes but he quickly brushed them away before t.j. could see them.
'ah, shut up, t.j.,' stacey snapped,
'yeah, shut up. t.j.,' i echoed.
'come on, man,' stacey said,' and next time do like i tell ya.'
little man hopped down from the bank. 'how's come they did that. stacey, huh!' he asked. dusting himself off. 'how's come
they didn't even stop for us !'

ogether. because of this the classes
in the higher grades grew smaller with each passing year.
the class buildings, with their backs practically against the forest wall, formed a semicircle facing a small one-room church
at the opposite edge of the compound. it was to this church that many of the school's students and their parents belonged. as
we arrived, the enormous iron bell in the church belfry was ringing vigorously, warning the milling students that only five
minutes of freedom remained.
little man immediately pushed his way across the lawn to the well. stacey and t.j., ignoring the rest of us now that they
were on the school grounds, wandered off to be with the other seventh-grade boys, and christopher-john and claude rushed
to reunite with their classmates of last year. left alone, i dragged slowly to the building that held the first four grades and sat
on the bottom step. plopping my pencils and notebook into the dirt, i propped my elbows on my knees and rested my chin in
the palms of m

ed the four-year
school near smellings creek. but there were some girls and boys like moe who made the trek daily, leaving their homes
while the sky was black and not returning until all was blackness again. i for one was certainly glad that i didn't live that far
away. i don't think my feet would have wanted that badly for me to be educated.
the chiming of the second bell began. i stood up dusting my bottom as the first, second, third, and fourth graders crowded up
the stairs into the hallway. little man flashed proudly past, his face and hands clean and his black shoes shining again. i
glanced down at my own shoes powdered red and, raising my right foot, rubbed it against the back of my left leg, then
reversed the procedure. as the last gong of the bell reverberated across the compound, i swooped up my pencils and
notebook and ran inside.

leading into the same large room w

m saving it for mary lou.
i glanced back at mary lou wellever, depositing her lunch pail on a shelf in the back of the room and said, 'not any more
you ain't,'
miss daisy crocker, yellow and buckeyed, glared down at me from the middle of the room with a look that said, 'soooooooo,
it's you, cassie logan.' then she pursed her lips and drew the curtain along the rusted iron rod and tucked it into a wide loop
in the back wall. with the curtain drawn back, the first graders gazed quizzically at us. little man sat by a window, his hands
folded, patiently waiting for miss crocker to speak.
mary lou nudged me. 'that's my seat, cassie logan.
'mary lou wellever,' miss crocker called primly, 'have a seat.'
'yes, ma'am,' said mary lou, eyeing me with a look of pure hate before turning away. 
miss crocker walked stiffly to her desk, which was set on a tiny platform and piled high with bulky objects covered by a
tarpaulin, she rapped the desk with a ruler, although the room was perfectly still, and said, 'wel

 browsing through the spotted pages. girls with blond braids and boys with blue eyes stared up at
me. i found a story about a boy and his dog lost in a cave and began reading while miss crocker's voice droned on
monotonously.
suddenly i grew conscious of a break in that monotonous tone and i looked up. miss crocker was sitting at miss davis's desk
with the first-grade books stacked before her, staring fiercely down at little man, who was pushing a book back upon the
desk.
'what's that you said, clayton chester logan !' she asked. the room became gravely silent. everyone knew that little man
was in big trouble for no one, but no one, ever called little man 'clayton chester' unless she or he meant serious business.
little man knew this too. his lips parted slightly as he took his hands from the book. he quivered, but he did not take his
eyes from miss crocker.'i â€“i said may i have another book please, ma'am,' he squeaked. 'that one's dirty.'
'dirty !' miss crocker echoed, appalled by such temerity. she sto

od up, gazing down upon little man like a bony giant, but
little man raised his head and continued to look into her eyes. 'dirty! and just who do you think you are, clayton chester!
here the county is giving us these wonderful books during these hard times and you're going to stand there and tell me that
the book's too dirty! now you take that book or get nothing at all i'
little man lowered his eyes and said nothing as he stared at the book, for several moments he stood there, his face barely
visible above the desk, then he turned and looked at the few remaining books and, seeming to realize that they were as badly
soiled as the one miss crocker had given him. he looked across the room at me. i nodded and little man, glancing up again
at miss crocker, slid the book from the edge of the desk, and with his back straight and his head up returned to his seat.
miss crocker sat d

own again. 'some people around here seem to be giving themselves airs. iâ€™ll tolerate no more of that.' she
scowled. 'sharon lake, come get your book.
i watched little man as he scooted into his seat beside two other little boys. he sat for a while with a stony face looking out
the window; then, evidently accepting the fact that the book in front of him was the best that he could expect, he turned and
opened it. rut as he stared at the book's inside cover, his face clouded, changing from sulky acceptance to puzzlement. his 
brews furrowed. then his eyes grew wide, and suddenly he sucked in his breath and sprang from his chair like a wounded
animal, hinging the boo

k onto the floor and stomping madly upon it.
miss crocker rushed to little man and grabbed him up in powerful hands. she shook him vigorously, then set him on the
floor again, 'now, just what's gotten into you, clayton chester!' but little man said nothing. he just stood staring down at
the open book, shivering with indignant anger. 'pick it up,' she ordered. 'no !' defied little man. 'no! i'll give you ten seconds
to pick up that book, boy. or i'm going to get my switch.' little man bit his lower lip, and i knew that he was not going to
pick up the book. rapidly, i turned to the inside cover of my own book and saw immediately what had made little man so
furious. stamped on the inside cover was a chart which read:
the blank lines continued down to line 20 and i knew that they had all been reserved for black students. a knot of anger
swelled in my throat and held there. but as miss crocker directed little man to bend over the 'whipping chair. 1 put aside my
anger and jumped u

'miz crocker. don't, please !' i cried. miss crocker's dark eyes warned me not to say another word. 'i know why he done it !'
'you want part of this switch, cassie !'
'no'm,' i said hastily. 'i just wanna tell you how come little man done what he done.'
'sit down!' she ordered as i hurried toward her with the open book in my hand,
holding the book up to her. i said. 'see, miz crocker, see what it says. they give us these ole books when they didn't
want'em no more.
she regarded me impatiently, but did not look at the book. 'now how could he know what it says! he can't read.'
'yes'm, he can. he been reading since he was four. he can't read all them big words, but he can read them columns. see
what's in the last row. please loo

d not even know what i was talking about, she had looked at the page
and had understood nothing,
'i said sit down. cassie !'
i started slowly toward my desk, but as the hickory stick sliced the tense air. i turned back around. 'miz crocker,' i said, 'i
don't want my book neither.
the switch landed hard upon little man's upturned bottom. miss crocker looked questioningly at me as i reached up to her
desk and placed the book upon it. then she swung the switch five more times and, discovering that little man had no
intention of crying, ordered him up.
'all right, cassie,' she sighed, turning to me, 'come on and get yours.'
by the end of the school day i had decided that i would tell mama everything before miss crocker had a chance to do so.
from nine years of trial and error, i had learned that punishment was always less severe when i poured out the whole truth to
mama on my own before she had heard anything from anyone else. i knew that miss crocker had not spoken to mama during
the lunch period, f

he said, placing a second book on
mama's desk with an outraged slam. 'at least she didn't have a tantrum and stomp all over hers. i tell you, mary. i just don't 
know what got into those children today. i always knew cassie was rather high-strung, but little man! he's always such a
perfect little gentle- man.'
mama glanced at the book i had rejected and opened the front cover so that the offensive pages of both books faced her. 'you
say cassie said it was because of this front page that she and little man didn't want the books !' mama asked quietly.
'yes, ain't that something!' miss crocker said, forgetting her teacher-training-school diction in her indignation. 'the very
idea! that's on all the books, and why they got so upset about it i'll never know.'
'you punish them!' asked mama, glancing up at miss crocker.
'well, i certainly did ! whipped both of them good with my hickory stick. wouldn't you have!' when mama did not reply,
she added defensively, 'i had a perfect right to.'
'of course you d
