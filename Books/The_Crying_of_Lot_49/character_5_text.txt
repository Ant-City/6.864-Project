aid, "electronic music, live?" 

"they put it on the tape, here, live, fella. we got a whole back room full of your audio oscillators, gunshot machines, contact 
mikes, everything man. that's for if you didn't bring your ax, see, but you got the feeling and you want to swing with the rest of 
the cats, there's always something available." 

"no offense," said metzger, with a winning baby igor smile. 
a frail young man in a drip-dry suit slid into the seat across from them, introduced himself as mike fallopian, and 

began proselytizing for an organization known as the peter pinguid society. 

"you one of these right-wing nut outfits?" inquired the diplomatic metzger. 
fallopian twinkled. "they accuse us of being paranoids." 

"they?" inquired metzger, twinkling also. 
"us?" asked oedipa. 

the peter pinguid society was named for the commanding officer of the confederate man-of-war "disgruntled," who 
early in 1863 had set sail with the daring plan of bringing a task force around cape horn to attack

nking, i went in there to ask about bones and instead we 
talked about the trystero thing. she stood in a nearly deserted parking lot, watching the headlights of metzger's car come at her, and 
wondered how accidental it had been. 

metzger had been listening to the car radio. she got in and rode with him for two miles before realizing that the whimsies of 

nighttime reception were bringing them kcuf down from kinneret, and that the disk jockey talking was her husband, mucho.  

though she saw mike fallopian again, and did trace the text of the courier's tragedy a certain distance, these follow-ups were no 

more disquieting than other revelations which now seemed to come crowding in exponentially, as if the more she collected the more 
would come to her, until everything she saw, smelled, dreamed, remembered, would somehow come to be woven into the tristero. 
for one thing, she read over the will more closely. if it was really pierce's attempt to leave an organized something behind after

'waste,' and we had best not go into it any further." 

"i saw it in a ladies' john," she confessed. but stanley koteks was no longer about to be sweet-talked. 
"forget it," he advised; opened a book and proceeded to ignore her. 

 
she in her turn, clearly, was not about to forget it. the envelope she'd seen koteks doodling what she'd begun to think of 
as the "waste symbol" on had come, she bet, from john nefastis. or somebody like him. her suspicions got embellished 
by, of all people, mike fallopian of the peter pinguid society. 

"sure this koteks is part of some underground," he told her a few days later, "an underground of the unbalanced, 

possibly, but then how can you blame them for being maybe a little bitter? look what's happening to them. in school they 
got brainwashed, like all of us, into believing the myth of the american inventorâ€”morse and his telegraph, bell and his

hering. she 
felt she was betraying driblette and herself. but left it alone, anxious that her revelation not expand beyond a certain point. 
lest, possibly, it grow larger than she and assume her to itself. when bortz asked her one evening if he could bring in 
d'amico, who was at nyu, oedipa told him no, too fast, too nervous. he didn't mention it again and neither, of course, 
did she. 

she did go back to the scope, though, one night, restless, alone, leery of what she might find. she found mike fallopian, a 

couple weeks into raising a beard, wearing button-down olive shirt, creased fatigue pants minus cuffs and belt loops, 
two-button fatigue jacket, no hat. he was surrounded by broads, drinking champagne cocktails, and bellowing low songs. 
when he spotted oedipa he gave her the wide grin and waved her over. 
"you look," she said, "wow. like you're all on the move. training rebels up in the mountains." hostile looks from the girls 
twined around what parts of fallopian were accessible.
