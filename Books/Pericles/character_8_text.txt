from him i come
with message unto princely pericles;
but since my landing i have understood
your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,
my message must return from whence it came.

helicanus.
we have no reason to desire it,
commended to our master, not to us:
yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,
as friends to antioch, we may feast in tyre.

that were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
for who digs hills because they do aspire
throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
o my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
but like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.

our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
that, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
they may awake their helps to comfort them.
i'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
and wanting breath to speak help me with tears.

this tarsus, o'er which i have the government,
a city on whom plenty held full hand,
for riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
and strangers ne'er beheld but wonder'd at;
whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
like one another's glass to trim them by:
their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
and not so much to feed on as delight;
all poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,

cleon.
but see what heaven can do!  by this our change,
these mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
were all too little to content and please,
although they gave their creatures in abundance,
as houses are defiled for want of use,
they are now starved for want of exercise:
those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
must have inventions to delight the taste,
would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,

is not this true?

dionyza.
our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.

cleon.
o, let those cities that of plenty's cup
and her prosperities so largely taste,
with their superflous riots, hear these tears!
the misery of tarsus may be theirs.

pericles.
i believe you;
your honour and your goodness teach me to 't,
without your vows. till she be married, madam,
by bright diana, whom we honour, all
unscissar'd shall this hair of mine remain,
though i show ill in 't.  so i take my leave
good madam, make me blessed in your care
in bringing up my child.

dionyza.
i have one myself,
who shall not be mere dear to my respect
than yours, my lord.

pericles.
madam, my thanks and prayers.

cleon.
we'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore,
then give you up to the mask'd neptune and
the gentlest winds of heaven.

pericles.
i will embrace
your offer.  come, dearest madam.  o, no tears,
lychorida, no tears:
look to your little mistress, on whose grace
you may depend hereafter. come, my lord.
