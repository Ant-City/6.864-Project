these nails?" she grabs my hand and pins it flat 
between her two pea green ones. no, her skin isn't 
exactly pea green now. it's more of a light evergreen. 
the shift in shade is no doubt an attempt to stay 
abreast of the capricious fashion trends of the 
capitol. "really, katniss, you could have left me 
something to work with!" she wails. 

it's true. i've bitten my nails to stubs in the past 
couple of months. i thought about trying to break the 
habit but couldn't think of a good reason i should.

time worrying about how it might affect my prep 
team.

birdlike, from tree to tree, catching on to the 
slenderest branches. rue, who i didn't save. who i let 
die. i picture her lying on the ground with the spear 
still wedged in her stomach... 

who else will i fail to save from the capitol's 
vengeance? who else will be dead if i don't satisfy

outside my door, haymitch gives my shoulder a pat 
and says, "you could do a lot worse, you know." he 
heads off to his compartment, taking the smell of 
wine with him. 

in my room, i remove my sodden slippers, my wet 
robe and pajamas. there are more in the drawers but 
i just crawl between the covers of my bed in my 
underclothes. i stare into the darkness, thinking 
about my conversation with haymitch. everything he 
said was true about the capitol's expectations, my 
future with peeta, even his last comment. of course, i 
could do a lot worse than peeta. that isn't really the 
point, though, is it? one of the few freedoms we have 
in district 12 is the right to marry who we want or not 
marry at all. and now even that has been taken away 
from me. i wonder if president snow will insist we 
have children. if we do, theyll have to face the 
reaping each year. and wouldn't it be something to 
see the child of not one but t

train station. today 111 get the works from my prep

"why? it's too cold for anything to show," i grumble. 
"not in district eleven," says effie. 

district 1 1. our first stop. i'd rather start in any other 
district, since this was rue's home. but that's not 
how the victory tour works. usually it kicks off in 12 
and then goes in descending district order to 1 , 
followed by the capitol. the victor's district is skipped

probably best to get us out of the way as soon as

peeta positions his artificial leg. "bad day, huh?" "it's 
nothing," i say. 

he takes a deep breath. "look, katniss, i've been 
wanting to talk to you about the way i acted on the 
train. i mean, the last train. the one that brought us 
home. i knew you had something with gale. i was 
jealous of him before i even officially met you. and it 
wasn't fair to hold you to anything that happened in 
the games. i'm sorry." 

his apology takes me by surprise. it's true that peeta 
froze me out after i confessed that my love for him 
during the games was something of an act. but i 
don't hold that against him. in the arena, i'd played 
that romance angle for all it was worth. there had

about him. i still don't, really.

i know what he means. nightmares — which i was no 
stranger to before the games — now plague me 
whenever i sleep. but the old standby, the one of my 
father being blown to bits in the mines, is rare. 
instead i relive versions of what happened in the 
arena. my worthless attempt to save rue. peeta 
bleeding to death. glimmer's bloated body 
disintegrating in my hands. cato's horrific end with 
the muttations. these are the most frequent visitors.

there would be no burrowing under those, no 
escaping to hunt. then i see the watchtowers, placed 
evenly apart, manned with armed guards, so out of 
place among the fields of wildflowers around them. 

"that's something different," says peeta.

rue did give me the impression that the rules in 
district 1 1 were more harshly enforced. but i never 
imagined something like this. 

now the crops begin, stretched out as far as the eye 
can see. men, women, and children wearing straw 
hats to keep off the sun straighten up, turn our way, 
take a moment to stretch their backs as they watch 
our train go by. i can see orchards in the distance, 
and i wonder if that's where rue would have worked,

on and on it goes. i can't believe the size of district 
1 1 . "how many people do you think live here?" peeta 
asks. i shake my head. in school they refer to it as a 
large district, that's all. no actual figures on the 
population. but those kids we see on camera waiting 
for the reaping each year, they can't be but a 
sampling of the ones who actually live here. what do 
they do? have preliminary drawings? pick the 
winners ahead of time and make sure they're in the 
crowd? how exactly did rue end up on that stage 
with nothing but the wind offering to take her place? 

i begin to weary of the vastness, the endlessness of 
this place. when effie comes to tell us to dress, i 
don't object. 

i go to my compartment and let the prep team do my 
hair and makeup. cinna comes in with a pretty 
orange frock patterned with autumn leaves. i think 
how much peeta will like the color. 

effie gets peeta and me together and goes through the

in our honor, and well respond with a scripted thank-

special allies among the dead tributes, it is considered 
good form to add a few personal comments as well. i 
should say something about rue, and thresh, too, 
really, but every time i tried to write it at home, i 
ended up with a blank paper staring me in the face: 
it's hard for me to talk about them without getting 
emotional. fortunately, peeta has a little something 
worked up, and with some slight alterations, it can 
count for both of us. at the end of the ceremony, we'll 
be presented with some sort of plaque, and then we 
can withdraw to the justice building, where a special 
dinner will be served.

the bottom of the stage for the families of the dead

with a hunched back and a tall, muscular girl i'm 
guessing is his sister. on rue's... i'm not prepared for 
rue's family. her parents, whose faces are still fresh 
with sorrow. her five younger siblings, who resemble 
her so closely. the slight builds, the luminous brown 
eyes. they form a flock of small dark birds. 

the applause dies out and the mayor gives the speech 
in our honor. two little girls come up with 
tremendous bouquets of flowers. peeta does his part 
of the scripted reply and then i find my lips moving to 
conclude it. fortunately my mother and prim have

rilled me so i can do it in my sleep. 

peeta had his personal comments written on a card, 
but he doesn't pull it out. instead he speaks in his 
simple, winning style about thresh and rue making 
it to the final eight, about how they both kept me 
alive — thereby keeping him alive — and about how this 
is a debt we can never repay. and then he hesitates 
before adding something that wasn't written on the 
card. maybe because he thought effie might make 
him remove it. "it can in no way replace your losses, 
but as a token of our thanks we'd like for each of the 
tributes' families from district eleven to receive one 
month of our winnings every year for the duration of 
our

lives." 

the crowd can't help but respond with gasps and 
murmurs. there is no precedent for what peeta has 
done. i don't even know if it's legal. he probably 
doesn't know, either, so he didn't ask in case it isn't. 
as for the families, they just stare at us in shock. 
their lives were changed forever when thresh and 
rue were lost, but this gift will change them again. a 
month of tribute winnings can easily provide for a 
family for a year. as long as we live, they will not 
hunger. 

56 | p a g e catching fire - suzanne collins 



i look at peeta and he gives me a sad smile. i hear 
haymitch's voice. "you could do a lot worse." at this 
moment, it's impossible to imagine how i could do 
any better. the gift... it is perfect. so when i rise up 
on tiptoe to kiss him, it doesn't seem forced at all.

 steps forward and presents us each with a 
plaque that's so large i have to put down my bouquet 
to hold it. the ceremony's about to end when i notice 
one of rue's sisters staring at me. she must be about 
nine and is almost an exact replica of rue, down to 
the way she stands with her arms slightly extended. 
despite the good news about the winnings, she's not 
happy. in fact, her look is reproachful. is it because i 
didn't save rue? 

no. it's because i still haven't thanked her, i think. 

a wave of shame rushes through me. the girl is right. 
how can i stand here, passive and mute, leaving all 
the words to peeta? if she had won, rue would never 
have let my death go unsung. i remember how i took 
care in the arena to cover her with flowers, to make 
sure her loss did not go unnoticed. but that gesture 
will mean nothing if i don't support it now. 

"wait!" i stumble forward, pressing the plaque to my 
chest. my allotte

refusal to play the games on anyone's terms but his 
own. the careers wanted him to team up with them 
from the beginning, but he wouldn't do it. i respected 
him for that." 

for the first time the old hunched woman — is she 
thresh's grandmother? — raises her head and the 
trace of a smile plays on her lips. 

the crowd has fallen silent now, so silent that i 
wonder how they manage it. they must all be holding 
their breath. 

i turn to rue's family. "but i feel as if i did know rue, 
and she'll always be with me. everything beautiful 
brings her to mind. i see her in the yellow flowers that 
grow in the meadow by my house. i see her in the 
mockingj ays that sing in the trees. but most of all, i 
see her in my sister, prim." my voice is undependable, 
but i am almost finished. "thank you for your 
children." i raise my chin to address the crowd. "and 
thank you all for the bread."

somewhere in the crowd, someone whistles rue's

end of the workday in the orchards. the one that 
meant safety in the arena. by the end of the tune, i 
have found the whistler, a wizened old man in a faded 
red shirt and overalls. his eyes meet mine. 

what happens next is not an accident. it is too well 
executed to be spontaneous, because it happens in 
complete unison. every person in the crowd presses

haymitch. "so smart about how you present yourself

places to land. my hair, my eyes, my shiny gold pin. 

"did you choose me, haymitch?" i ask. 

"yeah," he says. 

"why? you like him better," i say. 

"that's true. but remember, until they changed the 
rules, i could only hope to get one of you out of there 
alive," he says. "i thought since he was determined to 
protect you, well, between the three of us, we might 
be able to bring you home." 

"oh" is all i can think to say. 

"you'll see, the choices you'll have to make. if we

mated with female mockingbirds, creating an entirely 
new species.

hadn't counted on the highly controlled jabberj ay 
having the brains to adapt to the wild, to pass on its 
genetic code, to thrive in a new form. they hadn't 
anticipated its will to live.

it's a hike to the lake, no question. if he decides to 
follow me at all, gale's going to be put out by this

it. it's only one room, about twelve feet square. my

buildings — you can still see some of the foundations — 
and people came to them to play and fish in the lake.

the swelling closing my eye. the stones beneath me 
are wet with gale's blood, the air heavy with its scent. 
"stop it! youll kill him!" i shriek. 

i get a glimpse of my assailant's face. hard, with deep 
lines, a cruel mouth. gray hair shaved almost to 
nonexistence, eyes so black they seem all pupils, a 
long, straight nose reddened by the freezing air. the

hand flies to my shoulder, hungry for an arrow, but, 
of course, my weapons are stashed in the woods. i

even that pales in comparison with rue's life. 

i shove off the blanket and suck in the cold air that 
seeps through the windowpanes. 

prim... rue... aren't they the very reason i have to try 
to fight? because what has been done to them is so 
wrong, so beyond justification, so evil that there is no 
choice? because no one has the right to treat them as 
they have been treated?

"they had a few small mines, yes. but not enough to

vulnerable once winter passes. peeta's not home. i

see haymitch moving around his kitchen so early, 
though. i walk into his house without knocking. i can 
hear hazelle upstairs, sweeping the floors of the now- 
spotless house. haymitch isn't flat-out drunk, but he 
doesn't look too steady, either. i guess the rumors 
about ripper being back in business are true. i'm 
thinking maybe i better let him just go to bed, when 
he suggests a walk to town. 

haymitch and i can speak in a kind of shorthand 
now. in a few minutes i've updated him and he's told 
me about rumors of uprisings in districts 7 and 1 1 as 
well. if my hunches are right, this would mean almost 
half the districts have at least attempted to rebel.

takes a few minutes to compose myself, and even 
then my eyes and nose are still streaming. but inside 
me, the liquor feels like fire and i like it. 

"maybe it should be you," i say matter-of-factly as i 
pull up a chair. "you hate life, anyway." 

"very true," says haymitch. "and since last time i 
tried to keep you alive... seems like i'm obligated to 
save the boy this time." 

"that's another good point," i say, wiping my nose 
and tipping up the bottle again. 

"peeta's argument is that since i chose you, i now owe 
him. anything he wants. and what he wants is the 
chance to go in again to protect you," says haymitch.

downstairs, my mother and prim embrace me again, 
but they're not overly emotional. i know they're 
holding things in to make it easier on me. looking at 
prim's face, it's hard to imagine she's the same frail 
little girl i left behind on reaping day nine months 
ago. the combination of that ordeal and all that has 
followed — the cruelty in the district, the parade of sick 
and wounded that she often treats by herself now if 
my mother's hands are too full — these things have 
aged her years. she's grown quite a bit, too; we're 
practically the same height now, but that isn't what 
makes her seem so much older. 

my mother ladles out a mug of broth for me, and i ask 
for a second mug to take to haymitch. then i walk

"well write letters, katniss," says peeta from behind 
me. "it will be better, anyway. give them a piece of us 
to hold on to. haymitch will deliver them for us if... 
they need to be delivered." 

i nod and go straight to my room. i sit on the bed, 
knowing i will never write those letters. they will be 
like the speech i tried to write to honor rue and 
thresh in district 1 1 . things seemed clear in my 
head and even when i talked before the crowd, but 
the words never came out of the pen right. besides, 
they were meant to go with embraces and kisses and 
a stroke of prim's hair, a caress of gale's face, a 
squeeze of madge's hand. they cannot be delivered

his lips are almost in contact with mine. "what about

for some stupid reason, i blush, but i force myself to 
hold my ground. "no, i'm an open book," i whisper 
back. "everybody seems to know my secrets before i

he smiles. "unfortunately, i think that's true." his 
eyes flicker off to the side. "peeta is coming. sorry you 
have to cancel your wedding. i know how devastating 
that must be for you." he tosses another sugar cube

peeta's beside me, dressed in an outfit identical to 
mine. "what did finnick odair want?" he asks.

he doesn't want her taking us down to the gym. none

we sit in silence awhile and then i blurt out the thing 
that's on both our minds. "how are we going to kill 
these people, peeta?" 

"i don't know." he leans his forehead down on our 
entwined hands. 

"i don't want them as allies. why did haymitch want 
us to get to know them?" i say. "ith make it so much 
harder than last time. except for rue maybe. but i 
guess i never really could've killed her, anyway. she 
was just too much like prim." 

peeta looks up at me, his brow creased in thought. 
"her death was the most despicable, wasn't it?" 

"none of them were very pretty," i say, thinking of 
glimmer's and cato's ends.

unconcerned. "what did you paint, peeta?" she looks 
a little misty. "was it a picture of katniss?" 

"why would he paint a picture of me, effie?" i ask, 
somehow annoyed. 

"to show he's going to do everything he can to defend 
you. that's what everyone in the capitol's expecting, 
anyway. didn't he volunteer to go in with you?" effie 
says, as if it's the most obvious thing in the world. 

"actually, i painted a picture of rue," peeta says. 
"how she looked after katniss had covered her in 
flowers." 

there's a long pause at the table while everyone 
absorbs this. "and what exactly were you trying to 
accomplish?" haymitch asks in a very measured 
voice. 

"i'm not sure. i just wanted to hold them accountable, 
if only for a moment," says peeta. "for killing that

out the efforts of every tribute who came before him. 
well, maybe not. maybe this year he has only lit the 
fuse on a bomb that the victors themselves have been 
building. hoping someone would be able to detonate 
it. perhaps thinking it would be me in my bridal 
gown. not knowing how much i rely on cinna's 
talents, whereas peeta needs nothing more than his 
wits. 

as the bomb explodes, it sends accusations of 
injustice and barbarism and cruelty flying out in

suggestion of marriage or a family?

the blast of the anthem, cranked up so loud i can feel 
it vibrating through my bones, lets us know where

the same fears that i have? that every victor has? 
every parent in every district in panem?

mother and father swim before my eyes. their sorrow. 
their loss. i turn spontaneously to chaff and offer my

now completes his arm and hold fast.

i feel him lurch forward and realize finnick has come 
back for us and is hauling peeta along. i wedge my 
shoulder, which still seems under my control, under 
peeta's arm and do my best to keep up with finnick's 
rapid pace. we put about ten yards between us and 
the fog when finnick stops. 

"it's no good. i'll have to carry him. can you take 
mags?" he asks me. 

"yes," i say stoutly, although my heart sinks. it's true 
that mags can't weigh more than about seventy 
pounds, but i'm not very big myself. still, i'm sure i've 
carried heavier loads. if only my arms would stop 
jumping around. i squat down and she positions 
herself over my shoulder, the way she rides on 
finnick. i slowly straighten my legs and, with my 
knees locked, i can manage her. finnick has peeta 
slung across his back now and we move forward, 
finnick leading, me following in the trail he breaks

finnick's back by my side, peeta hanging over him. 
"it's no use," i say. "can you take them both? go on 
ahead, i'll catch up." a somewhat doubtful proposal, 
but i say it with as much surety as i can muster. 

i can see finnick's eyes, green in the moonlight. i can 
see them as clear as day. almost like a cat's, with a 
strange reflective quality. maybe because they are 
shiny with tears. "no," he says. "i can't carry them 
both. my arms aren't working." it's true. his arms jerk 
uncontrollably at his sides. his hands are empty. of 
his three tridents, only one remains, and it's in 
peeta's hands. "i'm sorry, mags. i can't do it." 

what happens next is so fast, so senseless, i can't 
even move to stop it. mags hauls herself up, plants a 
kiss on finnick's lips, and then hobbles straight into 
the fog. immediately, her body is seized by wild 
contortions and she falls to the ground in a horrible 
dance. 

i want to scream, but my throat is on fire. i tak

whether it moves from the poison that affected our 
nerves, the shock of the attack, or withdrawal from 
the drug that was her sustenance. there is nothing 
we can do. nothing but stay with her while she dies. 

"i'll watch the trees," finnick says before walking 
away. i'd like to walk away, too, but she grips my 
hand so tightly i would have to pry off her fingers, 
and i don't have the strength for that kind of cruelty. i 
think of rue, how maybe i could sing a song or 
something. but i don't even know the morphling's 
name, let alone if she likes songs. i just know she's 
dying. 

peeta crouches down on the other side of her and 
strokes her hair. when he begins to speak in a soft 
voice, it seems almost nonsensical, but the words 
aren't for me. "with my paint box at home, i can

"he won his games with wire. setting up that

could have." 

there's something odd about johanna not putting

say. "since you nicknamed him volts and all."

up thoughts of my father's death and rue's death and 
maysilee donner's death and my mother inheriting 
her songbird. oh, great, and now i'm thinking of gale, 
deep down in that horrible mine, with president

it look like an accident down there. a silent canary, a 
spark, and nothing more.

of white liquor, will get on. i realize only one person 
will be damaged beyond repair if peeta dies. me. 

"i do," i say. "i need you." he looks upset, takes a 
deep breath as if to begin a long argument, and that's 
no good, no good at all, because he'll start going on 
about prim and my mother and everything and i'll 
just get confused. so before he c

but as i stretch out on the sand i wonder, could it be 
more? like a reminder to me that i could still one day 
have kids with gale? well, if that was it, it was a 
mistake. because for one thing, that's never been part

said. 

that's true. no one in their right mind would let me 
make the plans. because i obviously can't tell a friend 
from an enemy.

a lot of people come by to talk to me, but i make all 
their words sound like the clicking of the insects in 
the jungle. meaningless and distant. dangerous, but 
only if approached. whenever the words start to 
become distinct, i moan until they give me more
