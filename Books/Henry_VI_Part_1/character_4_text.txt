  plantagenet. great lords and gentlemen, what means this
    silence?
    dare no man answer in a case of truth?
  suffolk. within the temple hall we were too loud;

  plantagenet. then say at once if i maintain'd the truth;

 these eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
    wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;
    weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief,
    and pithless arms, like to a withered vine
    that droops his sapless branches to the ground.
    yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
    unable to support this lump of clay,
    swift-winged with desire to get a grave,
    as witting i no other comfort have.
    but tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?
  first keeper. richard plantagenet, my lord, will come.
    we sent unto the temple, unto his chamber;
    and answer was return'd that he will come.
  mortimer. enough; my soul shall then be satisfied.
    poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
    since henry monmouth first began to reign,
    before whose glory i was great in arms,
    this loathsome sequestration have i had;
    and even since then hath richard been obscur'd,
    depriv'd of honour and inheritance.

  plantagenet. ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly us'd,
    your nephew, late despised richard, comes.

    and in his bosom spend my latter gasp.

london. the parliament house

flourish. enter the king, exeter, gloucester, warwick, somerset,
and suffolk;
the bishop of winchester, richard plantagenet, and others.
gloucester offers to put up a bill; winchester snatches it, and
tears it

  winchester. com'st thou with deep premeditated lines,
    with written pamphlets studiously devis'd?
    humphrey of gloucester, if thou canst accuse
    or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
    do it without invention, suddenly;
    i with sudden and extemporal speech
    purpose to answer what thou canst object.
  gloucester. presumptuous priest, this place commands my
    patience,
