â€˜but,â€™ said pippin.
â€˜but what?â€™ said gandalf. â€˜only one but will i allow tonight.â€™
â€˜gollum,â€™ said pippin. â€˜how on earth could they be going about with him, even following him? and i could see that faramir did not like the place he was taking them to any more than you do. what is wrong?â€™
â€˜i cannot answer that now,â€™ said gandalf. â€˜yet my heart guessed that frodo and gollum would meet before the end. for good, or for evil. but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonight. treachery, treachery i fear; treachery of that miserable creature. but so it must be. let us remember that a traitor may betray himself and do good that he does not intend. it can be so, sometimes. good night! â€˜
the next day came with a morning like a brown dusk, and the hearts of men, lifted for a while by the return of faramir, sank low again. the winged shadows were not seen again that day, yet e

better, but not poison. theyâ€™ve fed me, and so iâ€™m better off than you. there must be food and water somewhere in this place.â€™ `but thereâ€™s no time to look for them,â€™ said sam.
`well, things are a bit better than you think,â€™ said frodo. â€˜i have had a bit of luck while you were away. indeed they did not take everything. iâ€™ve found my food-bag among some rags on the floor. theyâ€™ve rummaged it, of course. but i guess they disliked the very look and smell of the lembas, worse than gollum did. itâ€™s scattered about and some of it is trampled and broken, but iâ€™ve gathered it together. itâ€™s not far short of what youâ€™ve got. but theyâ€™ve taken faramirâ€™s food, and theyâ€™ve slashed up my water-bottle.â€™
`well, thereâ€™s no more to be said,â€™ said sam. `weâ€™ve got enough to start on. but the waterâ€™s going to be a bad business. but come mr. frodo! off we go, or a whole lake of it wonâ€™t do us any good!â€™
â€˜not till youâ€™ve had a mouthful, sam,â€™ said frodo. `i wonâ€

ed the way, northward as near as he could guess, among the stones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine. but presently he stopped again.
â€˜itâ€™s no good, sam,â€™ he said. â€˜i canâ€™t manage it. this mail-shirt, i mean. not in my present state. even my mithril-coat seemed heavy when i was tired. this is far heavier. and whatâ€™s the use of it? we shanâ€™t win through by fighting.â€™
â€˜but we may have some to do,â€™ said sam. â€˜and thereâ€™s knives and stray arrows. that gollum isnâ€™t dead, for one thing. i donâ€™t like to think of you with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark.â€™
â€˜look here, sam dear lad,â€™ said frodo: â€˜i am tired, weary, i havenâ€™t a hope left. but i have to go on trying to get to the mountain, as long as i can move. the ring is enough. this extra weight is killing me. it must go. but donâ€™t think iâ€™m ungrateful. i hate to think of the foul work you must have had among the bodies to find it for me.â€™

that is the spirit of mordor, sam; and it has spread to every corner of it. orcs have always behaved like that, or so all tales say, when they are on their own. but you canâ€™t get much hope out of it. they hate us far more, altogether and all the time. if those two had seen us, they would have dropped all their quarrel until we were dead.â€™
there was another long silence. sam broke it again, but with a whisper this time. â€˜did you hear what they said about that gobbler, mr. frodo? i told you gollum wasnâ€™t dead yet, didnâ€™t i?â€™
â€˜yes, i remember. and i wondered how you knew,â€™ said frodo. â€˜well come now! i think we had better not move out from here again, until it has gone quite dark. so you shall tell me how you know, and all about what happened. if you can do it quietly.â€™
â€˜iâ€™ll try,â€™ said sam, â€˜but when i think of that stinker i get so hot l could shout.â€™
there the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny bush, while the drear light of mordor faded slowly into a deep

o keep awake could not go on much longer, he wakened frodo gently.
â€˜that gollumâ€™s about again, iâ€™m afraid, mr. frodo,â€™ he said. â€˜leastways, if it wasnâ€™t him, then thereâ€™s two of him. i went away to find some water and spied him nosing round just as i turned back. i reckon it isnâ€™t safe for us both to sleep together, and begging your pardon, but i canâ€™t hold up my lids much longer.â€™
â€˜bless you, sam!â€™ said frodo. â€˜lie down and take your proper turn! but iâ€™d rather have gollum than orcs. at any rate he wonâ€™t give us away to them - not unless heâ€™s caught himself.â€™
â€˜but he might do a bit of robbery and murder on his own,â€™ growled sam. â€˜keep your eyes open, mr. frodo! thereâ€™s a bottle full of water. drink up. we can fill it again when we go on.â€™ with that sam plunged into sleep.
light was fading when he woke. frodo sat propped against the rock behind, but he had fallen asleep. the water-bottle was empty. there was no sign of gollum.

s he passed.
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward, tearing the backs of his hands that still clasped his masterâ€™s. then he knew what had happened, for above him as he lay he heard a hated voice.
â€˜wicked masster!â€™ it hissed. â€˜wicked masster cheats us; cheats smÃ©agol, gollum. he musstnâ€™t go that way. he musstnâ€™t hurt preciouss. give it to smÃ©agol, yess, give it to us! give it to uss!â€™
with a violent heave sam rose up. at once he drew his sword; but he could do nothing. gollum and frodo were locked together. gollum was tearing at his master, trying to get at the chain and the ring. this was probably the only thing that could have roused the dying embers of frodoâ€™s heart and will: an attack, an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force. he fought back with a sudden fury that amazed sam, and gollum also. even so things might have gone far otherwise, if gollum himself had remained unchanged; but whatever dreadful paths, lonely and hungry and waterless, he had tro

age; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of fire. out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice.
â€˜begone, and trouble me no more! if you touch me ever again, you shall be cast yourself into the fire of doom.â€™
the crouching shape backed away, terror in its blinking eyes, and yet at the same time insatiable desire.
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing, hand on breast, his breath coming in great gasps, and gollum at his feet, resting on his knees with his wide-splayed hands upon the ground.
â€˜look out!â€™ cried sam. â€˜heâ€™ll spring!â€™ he stepped forward, brandishing his sword. â€˜quick, master!â€™ he gasped. â€˜go on! go on! no time to lose. iâ€™ll deal with him. go on!â€™
frodo looked at him as if at one now far away. â€˜yes, i must go on,â€™ he said. â€˜farewell, sam! this is the end at last. on mount doom doom shall fall. farewell!â€™ he turned and went on, walking slowly but erect up the climbing

 path.
â€˜now!â€™ said sam. â€˜at last i can deal with you!â€™ he leaped forward with drawn blade ready for battle. but gollum did not spring. he fell flat upon the ground and whimpered.
â€˜donâ€™t kill us,â€™ he wept. â€˜donâ€™t hurt us with nassty cruel steel! let us live, yes, live just a little longer. lost lost! weâ€™re lost. and when precious goes weâ€™ll die, yes, die into the dust.â€™ he clawed up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers. â€˜dusst!â€™ he hissed.
samâ€™s hand wavered. his mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil. it would be just to slay this treacherous, murderous creature, ju

ing in the dust, forlorn, ruinous, utterly wretched. he himself, though only for a little while, had borne the ring, and now dimly he guessed the agony of gollumâ€™s shrivelled mind and body, enslaved to that ring, unable to find peace or relief ever in life again. but sam had no words to express what he felt.
â€˜oh, curse you, you stinking thing!â€™ he said. â€˜go away! be off! i donâ€™t trust you, not as far as i could kick you; but be off. or i shall hurt you, yes, with nasty cruel steel.â€™
gollum got up on all fours, and backed away for several paces, and then he turned, and as sam aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path. sam gave no more heed to him. he suddenly remembered his master. he looked up the path and could not see him. as fast as he could he trudged up the road. if he had looked back, he might have seen not far below gollum turn again, and then with a wild light of madness glaring in his eyes come, swiftly but warily, creeping on behind, a slinking shadow among the ston

 and despaired. for they were forgotten. the whole mind and purpose of the power that wielded them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the mountain. at his summons, wheeling with a rending cry, in a last desperate race there flew, faster than the winds, the nazgÃ»l the ringwraiths, and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to mount doom.
sam got up. he was dazed, and blood streaming from his head dripped in his eyes. he groped forward, and then he saw a strange and terrible thing. gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen foe. to and fro he swayed, now so near the brink that almost he tumbled in, now dragging back, falling to the ground, rising, and falling again. and all the while he hissed but spoke no words.
the fires below awoke in anger, the red light blazed, and all the cavern was filled with a great glare and heat. suddenly sam saw gollumâ€™s long hands draw upwards to his mouth; his white fangs gleamed, and then snapped as they bit. fro

do gave a cry, and there he was, fallen upon his knees at the chasmâ€™s edge. but gollum, dancing like a mad thing, held aloft the ring, a finger still thrust within its circle. it shone now as if verily it was wrought of living fire.
â€˜precious, precious, precious!â€™ gollum cried. â€˜my precious! o my precious!â€™ and with that, even as his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his prize, he stepped too far, toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and then with a shriek he fell. out of the depths came his last wail precious, and he was gone.
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise. fires leaped up and licked the roof. the throbbing grew to a great tumult, and the mountain shook. sam ran to frodo and picked him up and carried him. out to the door. and there up

d fell upon his knees. in all that ruin of the world for the moment he felt only joy, great joy. the burden was gone. his master had been saved; he was himself again, he was free. and then sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand.
â€˜your poor hand!â€™ he said. â€˜and i have nothing to bind it with, or comfort it. i would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather. but heâ€™s gone now beyond recall, gone for ever.â€™
â€˜yes,â€™ said frodo. â€˜but do you remember gandalfâ€™s words: even gollum may have something yet to do? but for him, sam, i could not have destroyed the ring. the quest would have been in vain, even at the bitter end. so let us forgive him! for the quest is achieved, and now all is over. i am glad you are here with me. here at the end of all things, sam.â€™

all about the hills the hosts of mordor raged. the captains of the west were foundering in a gathering sea. the sun gleamed red, and under the wings of the nazgÃ»l the shadows of
