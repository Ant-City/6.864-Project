[CHARACTER] - 
      a nobleman, and fellow landowner, who is, like ranevsky, in financial difficulties. pischik is characterized mainly by his boundless optimism--he is always certain he will find the money somehow to pay for the mortgages that are due--but also by his continual borrowing money from ranevsky. pischik is something of a caricature; his name, in russian, means "squealer," appropriate for someone who never stops talking.
