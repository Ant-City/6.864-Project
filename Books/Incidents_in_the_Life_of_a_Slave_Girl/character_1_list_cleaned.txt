linda's master, enemy, and would-be lover. although dr.[CHARACTER] has the
legal right to "use" linda in any way he chooses, he seeks to seduce her by
means of threats and trickery rather than outright force. linda's rebelliousness
enrages him, and he becomes obsessed with the idea of breaking her will.
throughout the long battle over linda's right to own herself, dr.[CHARACTER] never
shows any sign of remorse or understanding that she is a person with rights and
feelings.
