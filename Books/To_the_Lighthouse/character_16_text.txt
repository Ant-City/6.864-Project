oting,
the drone and hum of the fields, a dog's bark, a man's shout, and
folded them round the house in silence. once only a board sprang on
the landing; once in the middle of the night with a roar, with a
rupture, as after centuries of quiescence, a rock rends itself from the
mountain and hurtles crashing into the valley, one fold of the shawl
loosened and swung to and fro. then again peace descended; and the
shadow wavered; light bent to its own image in adoration on the bedroom
wall; and mrs. mcnab, tearing the veil of silence with hands that had
stood in the wash-tub, grinding it with boots that had crunched the
shingle, came as directed to open all windows, and dust the bedrooms.

as she lurched (for she rolled like a ship at sea) and leered (for her
eyes fell on nothing directly, but with a sidelong glance that
deprecated the scorn and anger of the world--she was witless, she knew
it), as she clutched the banisters and hauled herself upstairs and
rolled from room to room, she sang

channel in the depths of obscurity through which light enough issued to
twist her face grinning in the glass and make her, turning to her job
again, mumble out the old music hall song. the mystic, the visionary,
walking the beach on a fine night, stirring a puddle, looking at a
stone, asking themselves "what am i," "what is this?" had suddenly an
answer vouchsafed them: (they could not say what it was) so that they
were warm in the frost and had comfort in the desert. but mrs. mcnab
continued to drink and gossip as before.

the spring without a leaf to toss, bare and bright like a virgin fierce
in her chastity, scornful in her purity, was laid out on fields wide-
eyed and watchful and entirely careless of what was done or thought by
the beholders. [prue ramsay, leaning on her father's arm, was given in
marriage. what, people said, could have been more fitting? and, they
added, how beautiful she looked!]

as summer neared, as the evenings lengthened, there came to the

 itself.

in spring the garden urns, casually filled with wind-blown plants, were
gay as ever. violets came and daffodils. but the stillness and the
brightness of the day were as strange as the chaos and tumult of night,
with the trees standing there, and the flowers standing there, looking
before them, looking up, yet beholding nothing, eyeless, and so
terrible.

thinking no harm, for the family would not come, never again, some
said, and the house would be sold at michaelmas perhaps, mrs. mcnab
stooped and picked a bunch of flowers to take home with her. she laid
them on the table while she dusted. she was fond of flowers. it was a
pity to let them waste. suppose the house were sold (she stood arms
akimbo in front of the looking-glass) it would want seeing to--it
would. there it had stood all these years without a soul in it. the
books and things were mouldy, for, what with the war and help being
hard to get, the house had not been cleaned as she could have wished.

n in the hall; the
rain-pipe had blocked over the study window and let the water in;
the carpet was ruined quite. but people should come themselves;
they should have sent somebody down to see. for there were clothes
in the cupboards; they had left clothes in all the bedrooms. what
was she to do with them? they had the moth in them--mrs. ramsay's
things. poor lady! she would never want them again. she was dead,
they said; years ago, in london. there was the old grey cloak she wore
gardening (mrs. mcnab fingered it). she could see her, as she came up
the drive with the washing, stooping over her flowers (the garden was a
pitiful sight now, all run to riot, and rabbits scuttling at you out of
the beds)--she could see her with one of the children by her in that
grey cloak. there were boots and shoes; and a brush and comb left on
the dressing-table, for all the world as if she expected to come back
tomorrow. (she had died very sudden at the end, they said.) and once
they had been coming, but had

put off coming, what with the war, and
travel being so difficult these days; they had never come all these
years; just sent her money; but never wrote, never came, and expected
to find things as they had left them, ah, dear! why the dressing-table
drawers were full of things (she pulled them open), handkerchiefs, bits
of ribbon. yes, she could see mrs. ramsay as she came up the drive with
the washing.

"good-evening, mrs. mcnab," she would say.

she had a pleasant way with her. the girls all liked her. but, dear,
many things had changed since then (she shut the drawer); many families
had lost their dearest. so she was dead; and mr. andrew killed; and
miss prue dead too, they said, with her first baby; but everyone had
lost some one these years. prices had gone up shamefully, and didn't
come down again neither. she could well remember her in her grey
cloak.

"good-evening, mrs. mcnab," she said, and told cook to keep a

 plate of
milk soup for her--quite thought she wanted it, carrying that heavy
basket all the way up from town. she could see her now, stooping over
her flowers; and faint and flickering, like a yellow beam or the circle
at the end of a telescope, a lady in a grey cloak, stooping over her
flowers, went wandering over the bedroom wall, up the dressing-table,
across the wash-stand, as mrs. mcnab hobbled and ambled, dusting,
straightening. and cook's name now? mildred? marian?--some name like
that. ah, she had forgotten--she did forget things. fiery, like all
red-haired women. many a laugh they had had. she was always welcome
in the kitchen. she made them laugh, she did. things were better then
than now.

she sighed; there was too much work for one woman. she wagged her head
this side and that. this had been the nursery. why, it was all damp in
here; the plaster was falling. whatever di

l butterflies burst from the chrysalis and
pattered their life out on the window-pane. poppies sowed themselves
among the dahlias; the lawn waved with long grass; giant artichokes
towered among roses; a fringed carnation flowered among the cabbages;
while the gentle tapping of a weed at the window had become, on
winters' nights, a drumming from sturdy trees and thorned briars which
made the whole room green in summer.

what power could now prevent the fertility, the insensibility of
nature? mrs. mcnab's dream of a lady, of a child, of a plate of milk
soup? it had wavered over the walls like a spot of sunlight and
vanished. she had locked the door; she had gone. it was beyond the
strength of one woman, she said. they never sent. they never wrote.
there were things up there rotting in the drawers--it was a shame to
leave them so, she said. the place was gone to rack and ruin. only
the lighthouse beam entered the rooms for a moment, sent its sudden
stare over bed and wall in the darkness of win

have told only by a red-hot poker among the nettles, or a scrap of
china in the hemlock, that here once some one had lived; there had been
a house.

if the feather had fallen, if it had tipped the scale downwards, the
whole house would have plunged to the depths to lie upon the sands of
oblivion. but there was a force working; something not highly
conscious; something that leered, something that lurched; something not
inspired to go about its work with dignified ritual or solemn chanting.
mrs. mcnab groaned; mrs. bast creaked. they were old; they were stiff;
their legs ached. they came with their brooms and pails at last; they
got to work. all of a sudden, would mrs. mcnab see that the house was
ready, one of the young ladies wrote: would she get this done; would
she get that done; all in a hurry. they might be coming for the
summer; had left everything to the last; expected to find things as
they had left them. slowly and painfully, with broom and pail,
mopping, scouring, mrs. mcnab, mrs.

ea in the bedroom sometimes, or in the study;
breaking off work at mid-day with the smudge on their faces, and their
old hands clasped and cramped with the broom handles. flopped on
chairs, they contemplated now the magnificent conquest over taps and
bath; now the more arduous, more partial triumph over long rows of
books, black as ravens once, now white-stained, breeding pale mushrooms
and secreting furtive spiders. once more, as she felt the tea warm in
her, the telescope fitted itself to mrs. mcnab's eyes, and in a ring of
light she saw the old gentleman, lean as a rake, wagging his head, as
she came up with the washing, talking to himself, she supposed, on the
lawn. he never noticed her. some said he was dead; some said she was
dead. which was it? mrs. bast didn't know for certain either. the
young gentleman was dead. that she was sure. she had read his name in
the papers.

(glibly, jovially, with the tea hot in her, she unwound her ball of
memories, sitting in the wicker arm-chair by the nursery fender).
there was always plenty doing, people in the house, twenty staying
sometimes, and washing up till long past midnight.

mrs. bast (she had never known them; had lived in glasgow at that time)
wondered, putting her cup down, whatever they hung that beast's skull
there for? shot in foreign parts no doubt.

it might well be, said mrs. mcnab, wantoning on with her memories; they
had friends in eastern countries; gentlemen staying there, ladies in
evening dress; she had seen them once through the dining-room door all
sitting at dinner. twenty she dared say all in their jewellery, and
she asked to stay help wash up, might be till after midnight.

ah, said mrs. bast, they'd find it changed. she leant out of the
window. she watched her son george scything the grass. they might
well ask, what had been done to it? seeing how old kennedy
