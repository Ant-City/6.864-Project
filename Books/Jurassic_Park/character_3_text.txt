ew years younger, perhaps seven or eight, her
blond hair pushed up under a mets baseball cap, and a baseball glove slung over her shoulder.
the two kids made their way nimbly down the path from the helipad, and stopped some distance
from gennaro and hammond.
low, under his breath, gennaro said, "christ."
"now, take it easy," hammond said. "their parents are getting a divorce, and i want them to
have a fun weekend here."
the girl waved tentatively.
"hi, grandpa," she said. "we're here."
the tour
tim murphy could see at once that something was wrong. his grandfather was in the middle of
an argument with the younger, red-faced man opposite him. and the other adults, standing
behind, looked embarrassed and uncomfortable. alexis felt the tension, too, because she hung
back, tossing her baseball in the air. he had to push her: "go on, lex."
"go on yourself, timmy."
"don't be a worm," he said.
lex glared at him, but ed regis said cheerfully, "i'll introduce you to everybody, and then we

"then why are they out now?" ellie said.
"i can't imagine. you know compys are scavengers, like buzzards. they're attracted to a dying

"ah, say again, didn't get that, john."
"don't land the boat! do you hear me?"
there was a pause. then a puzzled voice said, "sounds like some damn kid."
tim said, "don't land the ship! come back to the island!"
the voices sounded distant and scratchy. "did he-name was murphy?" and another voice

get his name?"
there was the sharp crackle of static. "-got
