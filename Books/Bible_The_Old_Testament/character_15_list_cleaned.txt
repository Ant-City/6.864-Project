[CHARACTER] - 
                the
last of israel's judges and the prophet who anoints both saul and
david as king. [CHARACTER] fulfills political and priestly duties for
israel, but he ushers in israel's monarchy mainly as a prophet--one
who pronounces god's words and decisions. [CHARACTER]'s stoic and aloof position
in israel allows saul to struggle with god and his fate on his own.
