sun, an ambulance was waiting by 
the side door and inside the door, as i went in, there 
was the smell of marble floors and hospital. it was all 
as i had left it except that now it was spring. i looked 
in the door of the big room and saw the major sitting 
at his desk, the window open and the sunlight coming 
into the room. he did not see me and i did not know 
whether to go in and report or go upstairs first and 
clean up. i decided to go on upstairs. 

the room i shared with the lieutenant rinaldi looked 
out on the courtyard. the window was open, my bed 
was made up with blankets and my things hung on the 
wall, the gas mask in an oblong tin can, the steel helmet 
on the same peg. at the foot of the bed was my flat

were on the trunk. my austrian sniper's rifle with its 
blued octagon barrel and the lovely dark walnut, cheek-

telescope that fitted

 it was, i remembered, locked in the 
trunk. the lieutenant, rinaldi, lay asleep on the other 
bed. he woke when he heard me in the room and sat 
up. 

"ciaou!" he said. "what kind of time did you 
have?" 

"magnificent." 

we shook hands and he put his arm around my neck 
and kissed me. 

"oughf," i said. 

"you're dirty," he said. "you ought to wash. 
where did you go and what did you do ? tell me every- 
thing at once." 

"i went everywhere. milan, florence, rome, naples, 
villa san giovanni, messina, taormina "

"since you are gone we have nothing but frostbites, 
chilblains, jaundice, gonorrhea, self-inflicted wounds, 
pneumonia and hard and soft chancres. every week 
some one gets wounded by rock fragments. there are 
a few real wounded. next week the war starts again. 
perhaps it starts again. they say so. do you think i 
would do right to marry miss barkley — after the war 
of course?" 

"absolutely," i said and poured the basin full of 
water. 

"to-night you will tell me everything," said rinaldi. 
"now i must go back to sleep to be fresh and beautiful 
for miss barkley." 

i took off my tunic and shirt and washed in the cold 
water in the basin. while i rubbed myself with a towel 
i looked around the room and out the window and at 
rinaldi lying with his eyes closed on the bed. he was 
good-looking, was my age, and he came from amalfi. 
he loved being a surgeon and we were great friends. 
while i was looking at him he opened his eyes. 

"have you any money?" 

"yes." 

"loan me fifty l

i dried my hands and took out my pocket-book from 
the inside of my tunic hanging on the wall. rinaldi 
took the note, folded it without rising from the bed and 
slid it in his breeches pocket. he smiled, "i must make

on miss barkley the impression of a man of sufficient 
wealth. you are my great and good friend and finan- 
cial protector." 

"go to hell," i said. 

that night at the mess i sat next to the priest and he 
was disappointed and suddenly hurt that i had not gone 
to the abruzzi. he had written to his father that i was 
coming and they had made preparation

p the river and the major told me that i would see 
about the posts for during the attack. the attack would 
cross the river up above the narrow gorge and spread 
up the hillside. the posts for the cars would have to 
be as near the river as they could get and keep covered. 
they would, of course, be selected by the infantry but 
we were supposed to work it out. it was one of those 
things that gave you a false feeling of soldiering. 

i was very dusty and dirty and went up to my room 
to wash. rinaldi was sitting on the bed with a copy 
of hugo's english grammar. he was dressed, wore 
his black boots, and his hair shone. 

"splendid," he said when he saw me. "you will 
come with me to see miss barkley." 

"no." 

"yes. you will please come and make me a good im- 
pression on her." 

"all right. wait till i get cleaned up." 

"wash up and come as you are." 

i washed, brushed my hair and we started. 

"wait a minute," rinaldi said. "perhaps we should 
have a drink." he opened his trunk and to

"not strega," i said. 

"no. grappa."

he poured two glasses and we touched them, first 
fingers extended. the grappa was very strong. 

"another?" 

"all right," i said. we drank the second grappa, 
rinaldi put away the bottle and we went down the

stairs. it was hot walking through the town but the sun 
was starting to go down and it was very pleasant. the 
british hospital was a big villa built by germans before 
the war. miss barkley was in the garden. another 
nurse was with her. we saw their white uniforms 
through the trees and walked toward them. rinaldi 
saluted. i saluted too but more moderately. 

"how do you do?" miss barkley said. " you' re not 
an italian, a

"oh, no." 

rinaldi was talking with the other nurse. they were 
laughing. 

"what an odd thing — to be in the italian army." 

"it's not really the army. it's only the ambulance." 

"it's very odd though. why did you do it?" 

"i don't know," i said. "there isn't always an ex- 
planation for everything." 

"oh, isn't there? i was brought up to think there 
was." 

"that's awfully nice." 

"do we have to go on and talk this way?" 

"no," i said. 

"that's a relief. isn't it?"

it all. he could have had anything he wanted if i 
would have known. i would have married him or any- 
thing. i know all about it now. but then he wanted to 
go to war and i didn't know." 

i did not say anything. 

"i didn't know about anything then. i thought it 
would be worse for him. i thought perhaps he couldn't 
stand it and then of course he was killed and that was 
the end of it." 

"i don't know." 

"oh, yes," she said. "that's the end of it."

we looked at rinaldi talking with the other nurse. 

"what is her name?" 

"ferguson. helen ferguson. your friend is a doc- 
tor, isn't he?" 

"yes. he's very good." 

"that's splendid you rarely find any one any good 
this close to the front. this is close to the front, isn't 
it?" 

"quite." 

"it's a silly front," she said. "but it's very beauti- 
ful. are they going to have an offensive?" 

"yes." 

"then we'll have to work. there's no work now." 

"have you done nursing long?"

i didn't say anything. 

"do you suppose it will always go on?" 

"no." 

"what's to stop it?" 

"it will crack somewhere." 

"we'll crack. we'll crack in france. they can't go 
on doing things like the somme and not crack." 

"they won't crack here," i said. 

"you think not?" 

"no. they did very well last summer." 

"they may crack," she said. "anybody may crack." 



a farewell to arms 21 

"the germans too." 

"no," she said. "i think not." 

we went over toward rinaldi and miss ferguson. 

"you love italy?" rinaldi asked miss ferguson in 
english. 

"quite well." 

"no understand," rinaldi shook his head. 

"abbastanza bene," i translated. he shook his head. 

"that is not good. you love england?" 

"not too well. i'm scotch, you see." 

rinaldi looked at me blankly. 

"she's scotch, so she loves scotland better than eng- 
land," i said in italian. 

"but scotland is england." 

i translated this for miss ferguson. 

"pas encore," said miss ferguson.

"never. we do not like the english." 

"not like the english? not like miss barkley?" 

"oh, that's different. you mustn't take everything 
so literally." 

after a while we said good-night and left. walking 
home rinaldi said, "miss barkley prefers you to me. 
that is very clear. but the little scotch one is very 
nice." 

"very," i said. i had not noticed her. "you like 
her?" 

"no," said rinaldi. 



chapter v 

the next afternoon i went to call on miss barkley 
again. she was not in the garden and i went to the 
side door of the villa where the ambulances drove up. 
inside i saw the head nurse, who said miss barkley was 
on duty — "there's a war on, you know." 

i said i knew. 

"you're the american in the italian army?" she 
asked. 

"yes, ma'am." 

"how did you happen to do that? why didn't you 
join up with us ?" 

"i don't know," i said. "could i join now?" 

"i'm afraid not now

eating and her lips opened and her head 
went back against my hand and then she was crying 
on my shoulder. 

"oh, darling," she said. "you will be good to me, 
won't you?" 

what the hell, i thought. i stroked her hair and 
patted her shoulder. she was crying. 

"you will, won't you?" she looked up at me. "be- 
cause we're going to have a strange life." 

after a while i walked with her to the door of the 
villa and she went in and i walked home. back at the 
villa i went upstairs to the room. rinaldi was lying 
on his bed. he looked at me. 

"so you make progress with miss barkley?" 

"we are friends." 

"you have that pleasant air of a dog in heat." 

i did not understand the word. 



28 a farewell to arms 

"of a what?" 

he explained. 

"you," i said, "have that pleasant air of a dog 
who—" 

"stop it," he said. "in a little while we would say 
insulting things." he laughed. 

"good-night," i said. 

"good-night, little puppy." 

i knocked over his candle with the pillow and got

rinaldi picked up the candle, lit it and went on 
reading. 



chapter vi 

i was away for two days at the posts. when i got 
home it was too late and i did not see miss barkley 
until the next evening. she was not in the garden and 
i had to wait in the office of the hospital until she came 
down. there were many marble busts on painted 
wooden pillars along the walls of the room they used 
for an office. the hall too, that the office opened on, 
was lined with them. they had the complete marble

 but they were un-

the civilian inhabitants had not been evacuated. i wore 
one when we went up to the posts and carried an eng-

them. they were a real mask. also we were required 
to wear an automatic pistol ; even doctors and sanitary 
officers. i felt it against the back of the chair. you

were liable to arrest if you did not have one worn in 
plain sight. rinaldi carried a holster stuffed with toilet 
paper. i wore a real one and felt like a gunman until 
i practised firing it. it was an astra 7.65 caliber with 
a short barrel and it jumped so sharply when you let it 
off that there was no question of hitting anything. i 
practised with it, holding below the target and trying to 
master the jerk of the ridiculous short barrel until i 
could hit within a yard of where i aimed at twenty 
paces and then the ridiculousness of carrying a pistol 
at all came

"do you want to very much?" 

"yes." 

we kissed and she broke away suddenly. "no. 
good-night, please, darling." we walked to the door 
and i saw her go in and down the hall. i liked to watch 
her move. she went on down the hall. i went on 
home. it was a hot night and there was a good deal 
going on up in the mountains. i watched the flashes 
on san gabriele. 

i stopped in front of the villa rossa. the shutters 
were up but it was still going on inside. somebody was 
singing. i went on home. rinaldi came in while i was 
undressing. 

"ah, ha!" he said. "it does not go so well. baby 
is puzzled." 

"where have you been?" 



34 a farewell to arms 

"at the villa rossa. it was very edifying, baby. 
we all sang. where have you been?" 

"calling on the british." 

"thank god i did not become involved with the 
british."

tain post and stopped the car at the smistimento where 
the wounded and sick were sorted by their papers

is ambulance business. yes, even in the ambulance 
business. british ambulance drivers were killed some- 
times. well, i knew i would not be killed. not in this 
war. it did not have anything to do with me. it 
seemed no more dangerous to me myself than war 
in the movies. i wished to god it was over though. 
maybe it would finish this summer. maybe the aus- 
trians would crack. they had always cracked in other 
wars. what was the matter with this war? every- 
body said the french were through. rinaldi said that 
the french had mutinied and troops marched on paris. 
i asked him what happened and he said, "oh, they 
stopped them." i wanted to go to austria without war. 
i wanted to go to the black forest. i wanted to go to 
the hartz mountains. where were the hartz moun- 
tains anyway? they were fighting in the carpathians. 
i did not want to go there anyway. it might be good 
though. i could go to spain if there was no war. the 
sun was going down and the day was cooling off. after

"and the priest was locked up," rocca said, "be- 
cause they found the three per cent bonds on his person. 
it was in france of course. here they would never 
have arrested him. he denied all knowledge of the five 
per cent bonds. this took place at beziers. i was there 
and reading of it in the paper, went to the jail and asked 
to see the priest. it was quite evident he had stolen the 
bonds." 

"i don't believe a word of this," rinaldi said. 

"just as you like," rocca said. "but i am telling it 
for our priest here. it is very informative. he is a 
priest; he will appreciate it." 

the priest smiled. "go on," he said. "i am listen- 
ing." 

"of course some of the bonds were not accounted 
for but the priest had all of the three per cent bonds 
and several local obligations, i forget exactly what they 
were. so i went to the jail, now this is the point of the

said was my name frederico enrico or enrico feder-

the major started us with red wine in mugs. half-way 
through the wine i did not want any more. i remem- 
bered where i was going. 

"bassi wins," i said. "he's a better man than i am. 
i have to go." 

"he does really," said rinaldi. "he has a rendezvous. 
i know all about it." 



a farewell to arms 43 

"i have to go." 

"another night," said bassi. "another night when 
you feel stronger." he slapped me on the shoulder. 
there were lighted candles on the table. all the officers 
were very happy. "good-night, gentlemen," i said. 

rinaldi went out with me. we stood outside the 
door on the patch and he said, "you'd better not go up 
there drunk." 

"fm not drunk, rinin. really." 

"you'd better chew some coffee." 

"nonse

"i'll get some, baby. you walk up and down." he 
came back with a handful of roasted coffee beans, 
"chew those, baby, and god be with you." 

"bacchus," i said. 

"i'll walk down with you." 

"i'm perfectly all right." 

we walked along together through the town and i 
chewed the coffee. at the gate of the driveway that 
led up to the british villa, rinaldi said good-night. 

"good-night," i said. "why don't you come in?" 

he shook his head. "no," he said, "i like the sim- 
pler pleasures." 

"thank you for the coffee beans." 

"nothing, baby. nothing." 

i started down the driveway. the outlines of the 
cypresses that lined it were sharp and clear. i looked 
back and saw rinaldi standing watching me and waved 
to him. 

i sat in the reception hall of the villa, waiting for 
catherine barkley to come down. some one was com-

until later that beds could be made with men in them. 
my orderly had finished pouring water and the bed felt 
cool and lovely and i was telling him where to scratch 
on the soles of my feet against the itching when one 
of the doctors brought in rinaldi. he came in very 
fast and bent down over the bed and kissed me. i saw 
he wore gloves.

you this — " it was a bottle of cognac. the orderly

"didn't you carry anybody on your back? gordini 
says you carried several people on your back but the 
medical major at the first post declares it is impossible. 
he has to sign the proposition for the citation." 

"i didn't carry anybody. i couldn't move." 

"that doesn't matter," said rinaldi. 

he took off his gloves. 

"i think we can get you the silver. didn't you re-

"not very firmly." 

"that doesn't matter. look how you are wounded.

should stay so long that they become friends." 

"maybe girls don't want to go to the front any more." 

"of course they do. they have plenty of girls. it is 
just bad administration. they are keeping them for the 
pleasure of dugout hiders in the rear." 

"poor rinaldi," i said. "all alone at the war with 
no new girls." 

rinaldi poured himself another glass of the cognac. 

"i don't think it will hurt you, baby. you take it." 

i drank the cognac and felt it warm all the way 
down. rinaldi poured another glass. he was quieter 
now. he held up the glass. "to your valorous wounds. 
to the silver medal. tell me, baby, when you lie here

between the beds and stopped. some one was with him. 
it was the priest. he stood there small, brown-faced, 
and embarrassed. 

"how do you do?" he asked. he put some packages 
down by the bed, on the floor. 

"all right, father." 

he sat down in the chair that had been brought for 
rinaldi and looked out of the window embarrassedly. 
i noticed his face looked very tired. 

"i can only stay a minute," he said. "it is late." 

"it's not late. how is the mess?" 

he smiled. "i am still a great joke," he sounded 
tired too. "thank god they are all well." 

"i am so glad you are all right," he said. "i hope 
you don't suffer." he seemed very tired and i was not 
used to seeing him tired. 

"not any more."

after them and any other americans on service in italy. 
there were many in the red cross. the states had de-

"where are the others?" 

"there are two up in the mountains and four still

"what do you wish me to do?" 

"you can go and take over the four cars on the

time. you haven't seen it up there, have you?" 

"no." 

"it was very bad. we lost three cars."

"yes, rinaldi wrote you."

"where is rinaldi?" 

"he is here at the hospital. he has had a summer 
and fall of it" 

"i believe it." 

"it has been bad," the major said. "you couldn't 
believe how bad it's been. i've often thought you were 
lucky to be hit when you were." 

"i know i was." 

"next year will be worse," the major said. "per-

"i'm glad to see it. i am glad to be back with you 
again, signor maggiore." 

he smiled. "you are very good to say so. i am 
very tired of this war* if i was away i do not believe 
i would come back." 

"is it so bad?" 

"yes. it is so bad and worse. go get cleaned up 
and find your friend rinaldi." 

i went out and carried my bags up the stairs. ri-

naldi was not in the room but his things were there and 
i sat down on the bed and unwrapped my puttees and 
took the shoe off my right foot. then i lay back on the 
bed. i was tired and my right foot hurt. it seemed 
silly to lie on the bed with one shoe off, so i sat up and 
unlaced the other shoe and dropped it on the floor, then 
lay back on the blanket again. the room was stuffy 
with the window closed but i

 was too tired to get up 
and open it. i saw my things were all in one corner of 
the room. outside it was getting dark. i lay on the 
bed and thought about catherine and waited for ri- 
naldi. i was going to try not to think about catherine 
except at night before i went to sleep. but now i was 
tired and there was nothing to do, so i lay and thought 
about her. i was thinking about her when rinaldi 
came in. he looked just the same. perhaps he was a 
little thinner. 

"well, baby," he said. i sat up on the bed. he 
came over, sat down and put his arm around me. 
"good old baby." he whacked me on the back and 
i held both his arms. 

"old baby," he said. "let me see your knee." 

"i'll have to take off my pants." 

"take off your pants, baby. we're all friends here. 
i want to see what kind of a job they did." i stood up, 
took off the breeches and pulled off the knee-brace. 
rinaldi sat o

n the floor and bent the knee gently back 
and forth. he ran his finger along the scar; put his 
thumbs together over the kneecap and rocked the knee 
gently with his fingers. 

"is that all the articulation you have?" 

"yes." 

"it's a crime to send you back. they ought to get 
complete articulation." 



a farewell to arms 177 

"it's a lot better than it was. it was stiff as a 
board." 

rinaldi bent it more. i watched his hands. he had 
fine surgeon's hands. i looked at the top of his head, 
his hair shiny and parted smoothly. he bent the knee 
too far. 

"ouch!" i said. 

"you ought to have more treatment on it with the 
machines," rinaldi said. 

"it's better than it was." 

"i see that, baby. this is something i know more 
about than you." he stood up and sat down on the 
bed. "the knee itself is a good job." he was through 
with the knee. "tell me all about everything." 

"there's
 
 ___________________________
 
 nothing to tell," i said. "i've led a quiet 
life." 

"you act like a married man," he said. "what's the 
matter with you?" 

"nothing," i said. "what's the matter with you?" 

"this war is killing me," rinaldi said, "i am very 
depressed by it." he folded his hands over his knee. 

"oh," i said. 

"what's the matter? can't i even have human im- 
pulses ?" 

"no. i can see you've been having a fine time. tell 
me. 

"all summer and all fall i've operated. i work all 
the time. i do everybody's work. all the hard ones 
they leave to me. by god, baby, i am becoming a 
lovely surgeon." 

"that sounds better." 

"i never think. no, by god, i don't think; i oper- 
ate." 

"that's right." 



178 a farewell

"but now, baby, it's all over. i don't operate now 
and i feel like hell. this is a terrible war, baby. you 
believe me when i say it. now you cheer me up. did 
you bring the phonograph records ?" 

"yes," 

they were wrapped in paper in a cardboard box in 
my rucksack. i was too tired to get them out. 

"don't you feel good yourself, baby?" 

"i feel like hell." 

"this war is terrible," rinaldi said. "come on. 
we'll both get drunk and be cheerful. then we'll go 
get the ashes dragged. then we'll feel fine." 

"i've had the jaundice," i said, "and i can't get 
drunk." 

"oh, baby, how you've come back to me. you come 
back serious and with a liver. i tell you this war is a 
bad thing. why did we make it anyway?" 

"we'll have a drink. i don't want to get drunk but 
we'll have a drink." 

rinaldi went across the room to the washstand and 
brought back two glasses and a bottle of cognac

once and tell me you're not serious." 

"i never kiss you. you're an ape." 

"i know, you are the fine good anglo-saxon boy. i 
know. you are the remorse boy, i know. i will wait 
till i see the anglo-saxon brushing away harlotry 
with a toothbrush." 

"put some cognac in the glass." 

we touched glasses and drank. rinaldi laughed at 
me. 

"i will get you drunk and take out your liver and put 
you in a good italian liver and make you a man 
again." 

i held the glass for some more cognac. it was dark 
outside now. holding the glass of cognac, i went over 
and opened the window. the rain had stopped falling. 
it was colder outside and there was a mist in the trees. 

"don't throw the cognac out the window," rinaldi 
said. "if you can't drink it give it to me." 

"go something yourself," i said. i was glad to see

rinaldi again. he had spent two years teasing me and 
i had always liked it. we understood each other very 
well. 

"are you married?" he asked from the bed. i was 
standing against the wall by the window. 

"not yet." 

"are you in love?" 

"yes." 

"with that english girl?" 

"yes." 

"poor baby. is she good to you?" 

"of course." 

"i mean is she good to you practically speaking?" 

"shut up."

"i will. you will see i am a man of extreme deli-

"rinin

be my friend, shut up." 

"i don't want to be your friend, baby. i am your 
friend." 

"then shut up." 

"all right." 

i went over to the bed and sat down beside rinaldi. 
he was holding his glass and looking at the floor. 

"you see how it is, rinin?" 

"oh, yes. all my life i encounter sacred subjects. 
but very few with you. i suppose you must have them 
too." he looked at the floor. 

"you haven't any?" 

"no." 

"not any?" 

"no." 

"i can say this about your mother and that about 
your sister?" 

"and that about your sister/' rinaldi said swiftly. 
we both laughed. 

"the old superman," i said. 

"i am jealous maybe," rinaldi said. 

"no, you're not." 

"

i don't mean like that. i mean something else. 
have you any married friends?" 

"yes," i said. 

"i haven't," rinaldi said. "not if they love each

"why not?" 

"they don't like me." 

"why not?" 



a farewell to arms 181 

"i am the snake. i am the snake of reason." 

"you're getting it mixed. the apple was reason." 

"no, it was the snake." he was more cheerful. 

"you are better when you don't think so deeply," i 
said. 

"i love you, baby," he said. "you puncture me when 
i become a great italian thinker. but i know many 
things i can't say. i know more than you." 

"yes. you do." 

"but you wil

"sometimes a good deal less." 

"perhaps i have improved, baby. you do not know. 
but there are only the two things and my work." 

"you'll get other things." 

"no. we never get anything. we are born with all 
we have and we never learn. we never get anything 
new. we all start complete. you should be glad not 
to be a latin." 

"there's no such thing as a latin. that is 'latin' 
thinking. you are so proud of your defects." rinaldi 
looked up and laughed. 

"we'll stop, baby. i am tired from thinking so 
much." he had looked tired when he came in. "it's 
nearly time to eat. i'm glad you're back. you are my 
best friend and my war brother." 

"when do the war brothers eat?" i asked. 



182 a farewell to arms 

"right away. we'll drink once more for your liver's 
sake." 

"like saint paul."

any sake you mention." 

"to your girl," rinaldi said. he held out his glass. 

"all right." 

"i'll never say a dirty thing about her." 

"don't strain yourself." 

he drank off the cognac. "i am pure," he said. 
"i am like you, baby. i will get an english girl too. 
as a matter of fact i knew your girl first but she was 
a little tall for me. a tall girl for a sister," he quoted. 

"you have a lovely pure mind," i said. 

"haven't i ? that's why they call me rinaldo puris- 
simo." 

"rinaldo sporchissimo." 

"come on, baby, we'll go down to

 eat while my mind 
is still pure." 

i washed, combed my hair and we went down the 
stairs. rinaldi was a little drunk. in the room where 
we ate, the meal was not quite ready. 

"i'll go get the bottle," rinaldi said. he went off 
up the stairs. i sat at the table and he came back with 
the bottle and poured us each a half tumbler of cognac. 

"too much," i said and held up the glass and sighted 
at the lamp on the table. 

"not for an empty stomach. it is a wonderful thing. 
it burns out the stomach completely. nothing is worse 
for you." 

"all right."

"you recommend it?" 

"heartily. i use no other. drink it down, baby, and 
look forward to being sick." 

i drank half the glass. in the hall i could hear the 
orderly calling. "soup! soup is ready!" 

the major came in, nodded to us and sat down. he 
seemed very small at table. 

"is this all we are?" he asked. the orderly put the 
soup bowl down and he ladled out a plate full. 

"we are all," rinaldi said. "unless the priest 
comes. if he knew federico was here he would be 
here." 

"where is he?" i asked. 

"he's at 307," the major said. he was busy with 
his soup. he wiped his mouth, wiping his upturned 
gray mustache carefully. "he will come i think. i 
called them and left word to tell him you were here." 

"i miss the noise of the mess," i said. 

"yes, it's quiet," the major said. 

"i will be noisy," said rinaldi. 

"drink some wine, enrico," said the major. he 
filled my glass. the

spaghetti came in and we were all 
busy. we were finishing the spaghetti when the priest 
came in. he was the same as ever, small and brown 
and compact looking. i stood up and we shook hands. 
he put his hand on my shoulder. 

"i came as soon as i heard," he said. 

"sit down," the major said. "you're late." 

"good-evening, priest," rinaldi said, using the eng- 
lish word. they had taken that up from the priest-bait- 
ing captain, who spoke a little english. "good-evening,

soup but he said he would start with the spaghetti. 

"how are you?" he asked me. 

"fine," i said. "how have things been?" 

"drink some wine, priest," rinaldi said. "take a lit- 
tle wine for your stomach's sake. that's saint paul, 
you know." 

"yes i know," said the priest poli

tely. rinaldi filled 
his glass. 

"that saint paul," said rinaldi. "he's the one who 
makes all the trouble." the priest looked at me and 
smiled. i could see that the baiting did not touch him 
now. 

"that saint paul," rinaldi said. "he was a rounder 
and a chaser and then when he was no longer hot he 
said it was no good. when he was finished he made 
the rules for us who are still hot. isn't it true, fede- 
rico?" 

the major smiled. we were eating meat stew now. 

"i never discuss a saint after dark," i said. the 
priest looked up from the stew and smiled at me. 

"there he is, gone over with the priest," rinaldi 
said. "where are all the good old priest-baiters? 
where is cavalcanti? where is brundi? where is

sare? do i have to bait this priest alone without 
support?" 

"he is a good priest," said the major. 

"he is a good priest," said rinaldi. "but still a 
priest. i try to make the mess like the old days. i want 
to make federico happy. to hell with you, priest!" 

i saw the major look at him and notice that he was 
drunk. his thin face was white. the line of his hair 
was very black against the white of his forehead. 



a farewell to arms 185 

"it's all right, rinaldo," said the priest. "it's all 
right." 

"to hell with you," said rinaldi. "to hell with the 
whole damn business." he sat back in his chair. 

"he's been under a s
 
 ___________________________
 
train and he's tired," the major 
said to me. he finished his meat and wiped up the 
gravy with a piece of bread. 

"i don't give a damn," rinaldi said to the table. "to 
hell with the whole business." he looked defiantly 
around the table, his eyes flat, his face pale. 

"all right," i said. "to hell with the whole damn 
business." 

"no, no," said rinaldi. "you can't do it. you can't 
do it. i say you can't do it. you're dry and you're 
empty and there's nothing else. there's nothing else i 
tell you. not a damned thing. i know, when i stop 
working." 

the priest shook his head. the orderly took away 
the stew dish. 

"what are you eating meat for?" rinaldi turned 
to the priest. "don' you know it's friday?" 

"it's thursday," the priest said. 

"it's a lie. it's friday. you're eating the body of 
our lord. it's god-meat. i know. it's dead aust

that's what you're eating." 

"the white meat is from officers," i said, completing 
the old joke. 

rinaldi laughed. he filled his glass. 

"don't mind me," he said. "i'm just a little crazy." 

"you ought to have a leave," the priest said. 

the major shook his head at him. rinaldi looked at 
the priest. 

"you think i ought to have a leave?" 



186 a farewell to arms 

the major shook his head at the priest. rinaldi was 
looking at the priest. 

"just as you like/' the priest said. "not if you don't 
want." 

"to hell with you," rinaldi said. "they try to get 
rid of me. every night they try to get rid of me. i 
fight them off. what if i have it. everybody has it. 
the whole world's got it. first," he went on, assum- 
ing the manner of a lecturer, "it's a little pimple. then 
we notice a rash between the shoulders. then we notice 
nothing at all. we put our faith in mercury."

"a mercurial product," rinaldi said. he acted very 
elated now. "i know something worth two of that. 
good old priest," he said. "you'll never get it. baby 
will get it. it's an industrial accident. it's a simple 
industrial accident." 

the orderly brought in the sweet and coffee. the 
dessert was a sort of black bread pudding with hard 
sauce. the lamp was smoking ; the black smoke going 
close up inside the chimney. 

"bring two candles and take away the lamp," the 
major said. the orderly brought two lighted candles

h in a saucer, and took out the lamp blowing it out. 
rinaldi was quiet now. he seemed all right. we 
talked and after the coffee we all went out into the hall. 

"you want to talk to the priest. i have to go in the 
town," rinaldi said. "good-night, priest." 

"good-night, rinaldo," the priest said. 

"i'll see you fredi," rinaldi said. 

"yes," i said. "come in early." he made a face and 
went out the door. the major was standing with us. 
"he's very tired and overworked," he said. "he thinks 
too he has syphilis. i don't believe it but he may have.

"please do. good-night. don't let rinaldi drink so 
much brandy." 

"i'll try not to." 

"good-night, priest." 

"good-night, signor maggiore." 

he went off into his office. 



chapter xxvi 

i went to the door and looked out. it had stopped 
raining but there was a mist. 

"should we go upstairs ?" i asked the priest. 

"i can only stay a little while." 

"come on up." 

we climbed the stairs and went into my room. i lay 
down on rinaldi's bed. the priest sat on my cot that 
the orderly had set up. it was dark in the room. 

"well,"

we stood up and shook hands in the dark. 

"i sleep at 307 now," he said. 

"i go out on post early to-morrow." 

'til see you when you come back." 

"we'll have a walk and talk together." i walked 
with him to the door. 

"don't go down," he said. "it is very nice that you 
are back. though not so nice for you." he put his 
hand on my shoulder. 

"it's all right for me," i said. "good-night." 

"good-night. ciaou !" 

"ciaou !" i said. i was deadly sleepy. 




chapter xxvii 

i woke when rinaldi came in but he did not talk 
and i went back to sleep again. in the morning i was 
dressed and gone before it was light. rinaldi did not 
wake when i left. 

i had not seen the bainsizza before and it was strange 
to go up the slope where the austrians had been, be- 
yond the place on the river where i had been wounded. 
there was a steep new road and many trucks. beyond, 
the road flattened out and i saw woods and steep hills 
in the mist. there were woods that had been taken

house anyway. the government gyps us." 

"take the car out and have the mechanics go over 
it," i said. "change the oil and check the differential. 
fill it up and then get some sleep." 

"yes, signor tenente." 

the villa was empty. rinaldi was gone with the 
hospital. the major was gone taking hospital person- 
nel in the staff car. there was a note on the window 
for me to fill the cars with the material piled in the hall 
and to proceed to pordenone. the mechanics were 
gone already. i went out back to the garage. the 
other two cars came in while i was there and their driv- 
ers got down. it was starting to rain again. 

"i'm so sleepy i went to sleep three times com- 
ing here from plava," piani said. "what are we going

"if you wake in three hours and i haven't called you, 
wake me, will you?" 

"i haven't any watch, tenente." 

"there's a clock on the wall in the major's room." 

"all right" 

i went out then through the dining-room and the 
hall and up the marble stairs to the room where i had 
lived with rinaldi. it was raining outside. i went 
to the window and looked out. it was getting dark and 
i saw the three cars standing in line under the trees.
