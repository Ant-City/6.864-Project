i prithee,
    supply me with the habit, and instruct me
    how i may formally in person bear me
    like a true friar. moe reasons for this action
    at our more leisure shall i render you.
    only, this one: lord angelo is precise;
    stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
    that his blood flows, or that his appetite
    is more to bread than stone. hence shall we see,
    if power change purpose, what our seemers be.         exeunt

  isabella. and have you nuns no farther privileges?
  francisca. are not these large enough?
  isabella. yes, truly; i speak not as desiring more,
    but rather wishing a more strict restraint
    upon the sisterhood, the votarists of saint clare.
  lucio. [ within] ho! peace be in this place!
  isabella. who's that which calls?
  francisca. it is a man's voice. gentle isabella,
    turn you the key, and know his business of him:

    then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
    or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
    he calls again; i pray you answer him.        exit francisca
  isabella. peace and prosperity! who is't that calls?

                           enter lucio

  lucio. hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
    proclaim you are no less. can you so stead me
    as bring me to the sight of isabella,
    a novice of this place, and the fair sister
    to her unhappy brother claudio?
  isabella. why her 'unhappy brother'? let me ask
    the rather, for i now must make you know
    i am that isabella, and his sister.

  isabella. woe me! for what?
  lucio. for that which, if myself might be his judge,
    he should receive his punishment in thanks:
    he hath got his friend with child.
  isabella. sir, make me not your story.
  lucio. it is true.
    i would not- though 'tis my familiar sin
    with maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,
    tongue far from heart- play with all virgins so:
    i hold you as a thing enskied and sainted,
    by your renouncement an immortal spirit,

  isabella. some one with child by him? my cousin juliet?
  lucio. is she your cousin?
  isabella. adoptedly, as school-maids change their names
    by vain though apt affection.
  lucio. she it is.
  isabella. o, let him marry her!
  lucio. this is the point.
    the duke is very strangely gone from hence;
    bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
    in hand, and hope of action; but we do learn,
    by those that know the very nerves of state,
    his givings-out were of an infinite distance
    from his true-meant design. upon his place,
    and with full line of his authority,
    governs lord angelo, a man whose blood
    is very snow-broth, one who never feels

    he- to give fear to use and liberty,
    which have for long run by the hideous law,
    as mice by lions- hath pick'd out an act
    under whose heavy sense your brother's life
    falls into forfeit; he arrests him on it,
    and follows close the rigour of the statute
    to make him an example. all hope is gone,
    unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
    to soften angelo. and that's my pith of business
    'twixt you and your poor brother.
  isabella. doth he so seek his life?
  lucio. has censur'd him
    already, and, as i hear, the provost hath
    a warrant for his execution.
  isabella. alas! what poor ability's in me
    to do him good?
  lucio. assay the pow'r you have.
  isabella. my power, alas, i doubt!
  lucio. our doubts are traitors,
    and make us lose the good we oft might win
    by fearing to attempt. go to lord angelo,
    and let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
    men give like gods; but when they weep

    i'll send him certain word of my success.

    if not already.

  isabella. there is a vice that most i do abhor,

well; the matter?
  isabella. i have a brother is condemn'd to die;
    i do beseech you, let it be his fault,
    and not my brother.
  provost. [aside] heaven give thee moving graces.
  angelo. condemn the fault and not the actor of it!
    why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done;
    mine were the very cipher of a function,
    to fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
    and let go by the actor.
  isabella. o just but severe law!
    i had a brother, then. heaven keep your honour!
  lucio. [to isabella] give't not o'er so; to him again, entreat
him,
    kneel down before him, hang upon his gown;
    you are too cold: if you should need a pin,
    you could not with more tame a tongue desire it.
    to him, i say.
  isabella. must he needs die?
  angelo. maiden, no remedy.
  isabella. yes; i do think that you might pardon him.
    and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

o. i will not do't.
  isabella. but can you, if you would?
  angelo. look, what i will not, that i cannot do.
  isabella. but might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
    if so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
    as mine is to him?
  angelo. he's sentenc'd; 'tis too late.
  lucio. [to isabella] you are too cold.
  isabella. too late? why, no; i, that do speak a word,
    may call it back again. well, believe this:
    no ceremony that to great ones longs,
    not the king's crown nor the deputed sword,
    the marshal's truncheon nor the judge's robe,
    become them with one half so good a grace
    as mercy does.
    if he had been as you, and you as he,
    you would have slipp'd like him; but he, like you,
    would not have been so stern.

    no; i would tell what 'twere to be a judge
    and what a prisoner.
  lucio. [to isabella] ay, touch him; there's the vein.
  angelo. your brother is a forfeit of the law,
    and you but waste your words.
  isabella. alas! alas!
    why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
    and he that might the vantage best have took
    found out the remedy. how would you be
    if he, which is the top of judgment, should
    but judge you as you are? o, think on that;
    and mercy then will breathe within your lips,
    like man new made.
  angelo. be you content, fair maid.
    it is the law, not i condemn your brother.
    were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
    it should be thus with him. he

    he's not prepar'd for death. even for our kitchens
    we kill the fowl of season; shall we serve heaven
    with less respect than we do minister
    to our gross selves? good, good my lord, bethink you.
    who is it that hath died for this offence?
    there's many have committed it.

  isabella. because authority, though it err like others,

    that skins the vice o' th' top. go to your bosom,

  angelo. how, bribe me?

    that shall be up at heaven and enter there

    to pardon him that hath from nature stol'n
    a man already made, as to remit
    their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
    in stamps that are forbid; 'tis all as easy
    falsely to take away a life true made
    as to put metal in restrained means
    to make a false one.
  isabella. 'tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
  angelo. say you so? then i shall pose you quickly.
    which had you rather- that the most just law
    now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
    give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
    as she that he hath stain'd?
  isabella. sir, believe this:
    i had rather give my body than my soul.
  angelo. i talk not of your soul; our compell'd sins
    stand more for number than for accompt.
  isabella. how say you?
  angel
 
 ___________________________
 
o. nay, i'll not warrant that; for i can speak
    against the thing i say. answer to this:
    i, now the voice of the recorded law,
    pronounce a sentence on your brother's life;
    might there not be a charity in sin
    to save this brother's life?
  isabella. please you to do't,
    i'll take it as a peril to my soul
    it is no sin at all, but charity.
  angelo. pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul,
    were equal poise of sin and charity.
  isabella. that i do beg his life, if it be sin,
    heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
    if that be sin, i'll make it my morn prayer
    to have it added to the faults of mine,
    and nothing of your answer.
  angelo. nay, but hear me;
    your sense pursues not mine; either you are ignorant
    or seem so, craftily; and that's not good.
  isabella. let me be ignorant, and in nothing good
    but graciously to know i am no better.

  angelo. admit no other way to save his life,
    as i subscribe not that, nor any other,
    but, in the loss of question, that you, his sister,
    finding yourself desir'd of such a person
    whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
    could fetch your brother from the manacles
    of the all-binding law; and that there were
    no earthly mean to save him but that either
    you must lay down the treasures of your body
    to this supposed, or else to let him suf

    what would you do?
  isabella. as much for my poor brother as myself;
    that is, were i under the terms of death,
    th' impression of keen whips i'd wear as rubies,
    and strip myself to death as to a bed
    that longing have been sick for, ere i'd yield
    my body up to shame.
  angelo. then must your brother die.
  isabella. and 'twere the cheaper way:
    better it were a brother died at once
    than that a sister, by redeeming him,
    should die for ever.
  angelo. were not you, then, as cruel as the sentence
    that you have slander'd so?
  isabella. ignominy in ransom and free pardon
    are of two houses: lawful mercy
    is nothing kin to foul redemption.
  angelo. you seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
    and rather prov'd the sliding of your brother
    a merriment than a vice.

  claudio. now, sister, what's the comfort?
  isabella. why,
    as all comforts are; most good, most good, indeed.
    lord angelo, having affairs to heaven,
    intends you for his swift ambassador,
    where you shall be an everlasting leiger.
    therefore, your best appointment make with speed;
    to-morrow you set on.
  claudio. is there no remedy?
  isabella. none, but such remedy as, to save a head,
    to cleave a heart in twain.
  claudio. but is there any?
  isabella. yes, brother, you may live:
    there is a devilish mercy in the judge,
    if you'll implore it, that will free your life,
    but fetter you till death.
  claudio. perpetual durance?
  isabella. ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
    though all the world's vastidity you had,
    to a determin'd scope.
  claudio. but in what nature?
  isabella. in such a one as

    and leave you naked.
  claudio. let me know the point.
  isabella. o, i do fear thee, claudio; and i quake,
    lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
    and six or seven winters more respect
    than a perpetual honour. dar'st thou die?
    the sense of death is most in apprehension;
    and the poor beetle that we tread upon
    in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
    as when a giant dies.
  claudio. why give you me this shame?
    think you i can a resolution fetch
    from flow'ry tenderness? if i must die,

  isabella. there spake my brother; there my father's grave
    did utter forth a voice. yes, thou must die:
    thou art too noble to conserve a life
    in base appliances. this outward-sainted deputy,
    whose settled visage and deliberate word
    nips youth i' th' head, and follies doth enew
    as falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;
    his filth within being cast, he would appear
    a pond as deep as hell.
  claudio. the precise angelo!
  isabella. o, 'tis the cunning livery of hell

    thou mightst be freed?
  claudio. o heavens! it cannot be.
  isabella. yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
    so to offend him still. this night's the time
    that i should do what i abhor to name,
    or else thou diest to-morrow.
  claudio. thou shalt not do't.
  isabella. o, were it but my life!
    i'd throw it down for your deliverance
    as frankly as a pin.
  claudio. thanks, dear isabel.
  isabella. be ready, claudio, for your death to-morrow.
  claudio. yes. has he affections in him
    that thus can make him bite the law by th' nose
    when he would force it? sure it is no sin;
    or of the deadly seven it is the least.
  isabella. which is the least?

    why would he for the momentary trick

  isabella. what says my brother?
  claudio. death is a fearful thing.
  isabella. and shamed life a hateful.
  claudio. ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
    to lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;
    this sensible warm motion to become
    a kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
    to bathe in fiery floods or to reside
    in thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
    to be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
    and blown with restless violence round about
    the pendent world; or to be worse than worst
    of those that lawless and incertain thought

    the weariest and most loathed worldly life
    that age, ache, penury, and imprisonment,
    can lay on nature is a paradise
    to what we fear of death.
  isabella. alas, alas!
  claudio. sweet sister, let me live.
    what sin you do to save a brother's life,
    nature dispenses with the deed so far
    that it becomes a virtue.
  isabella. o you beast!
    o faithless coward! o dishonest wretch!
    wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
    is't not a kind of incest to take life
    from thine own sister's shame? what should i think?
    heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
    for such a warped slip of wilderness
    ne'er issu'd from his blood. take my defiance;
    die; perish. might but my bending down

    i'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,

    'tis best that thou diest quickly.

  isabella. what is your will?
  duke. might you dispense with your leisure, i would by and by
have
    some speech with you; the satisfaction i would require is
    likewise your own benefit.
  isabella. i have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be stolen
out
    of other affairs; but i will attend you awhile.

  duke. the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the
    goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in
goodness;
    but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the
body
    of it ever fair. the assault that angelo hath made to you,
    fortune hath convey'd to my understanding; and, but that
frailty
    hath examples for his falling, i should wonder at angelo. how
    will you do to content this substitute, and to save your
brother?
  isabella. i am now going to resolve him; i had rather my
brother
    die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. but, o,
how
    much is the good duke deceiv'd in angelo! if ever he return,
and
    i can speak to him, i will open my lips in vain, or discover
his
    government.
  duke. that shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now
stands,
    he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only.
    therefore fasten your ear on my advisings; to the love i have

oing good a remedy presents itself. i do make myself believe
    that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a
merited
    benefit; redeem your brother from the angry law; do no stain
to
    your own gracious person; and much please the absent duke, if
    peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this
    business.
  isabella. let me hear you speak farther; i have spirit to do
    anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
  duke. virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. have you not
    heard speak of mariana, the sister of frederick, the great
    soldier who miscarried at sea?
  isabella. i have heard of the lady, and good words went with
her
    name.
  duke. she should this angelo have married; was affianced to her
by
    oath, and the nuptial appointed; between which time of the

  contract and limit of the solemnity her brother frederick was
    wreck'd at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of
his
    sister. but mark how heavily this befell to the poor
gentlewoman:
    there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love
toward
    her ever most kind and natural; with him the portion and
sinew of
    her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate
    husband, this well-seeming angelo.
  isabella. can this be so? did angelo so leave her?
  duke. left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his
    comfort; swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her
discoveries
    of dishonour; in few, bestow'd her on her own lamentation,
which
    she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is
    washed with them, but relents not.
  isabella. what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
from
    the world! what corruption in this life that it will let this

  duke. it is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of
it
    not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonour in
    doing it.
  isabella. show me how, good father.
  duke. this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of
her
    first affection; his unjust unkindness, that in all reason
should
    have quenched her love, hath, like an impediment in the
current,
    made it more violent and unruly. go you to angelo; answer his
    requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with his demands
to
    the point; only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that
    your stay with him may not be long; that the time m

what
    think you of it?
  isabella. the image of it gives me content already; and i trust
it
    will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
  duke. it lies much in your holding up. haste you speedily to
    angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him
    promise of satisfaction. i will presently to saint luke's;
there,
    at the moated grange, resides this dejected mariana. at that
    place call upon me; and dispatch with angelo, that it may be

    how he refell'd me, and how i replied,
    for this was of much length- the vile conclusion
    i now begin with grief and shame to utter:
    he would not, but by gift of my chaste body
    to his concupiscible intemperate lust,
    release my brother; and, after much debatement,
    my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
    and i did yield to him. but the next morn betimes,

  duke. this is most likely!
  isabella. o that it were as like as it is true!
  duke. by heaven, fond wretch, thou know'st not what thou
speak'st,
    or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
    in hateful practice. first, his integrity
    stands without blemish; next, it imports no reason
    that with such vehemency he should pursue
    faults proper to himself. if he had so offended,
    he would have weigh'd thy brother by himself,
    and not have cut him off. some one hath set you on;
    confess the truth, and

  isabella. and is this all?
    then, o you blessed ministers above,
    keep me in patience; and, with ripened time,
    unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
    in countenance! heaven shield your grace from woe,
    as i, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
  duke. i know you'd fain be gone. an officer!

    a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall

  duke. a ghostly father, belike. who knows that lodowick?
  lucio. my lord, i know him; 'tis a meddling friar.

knowledge that there was complaint
    intended 'gainst lord angelo- came i hither
    to speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
    is true and false; and what he, with his oath
    and all probation, will make up full clear,
    whensoever he's convented. first, for this woman-
    to justify this worthy nobleman,
    so vulgarly and personally accus'd-
    her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
    till she herself confess it.
  duke. good friar, let's hear it.         exit isabella guarded
    do you not smile at this, lord angelo?
    o heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
    give us some seats. come, cousin angelo;
    in this i'll be impartial; be you judge
    of your own cause.

                     enter mariana veiled

    is this the witness, friar?
  first let her show her face, and after speak.
  mariana. pardon, my lord; i will not show my face
    until my husband bid me.
  duke. what, are you married?
  mariana. no, my lord.
  duke. are you a

with
    her. [exit an attendant] pray you, my lord, give me leave to
    question; you shall see how i'll handle her.
  lucio. not better than he, by her own report.
  escalus. say you?
  lucio. marry, sir, i think, if you handled her privately, she
would
    sooner confess; perchance, publicly, she'll be asham'd.

  escalus. my lord, i am more amaz'd at his dishonour
    than at the strangeness of it.
  duke. come hither, isabel.
    your friar is now your prince. as i was then
    advertising and holy to your business,
    not changing heart with habit, i am still
    attorney'd at your service.
  isabella. o, give me pardon,
    that i, your vassal have employ'd and pain'd
    your unknown sovereignty.
  duke. you are pardon'd, isabel.
    and now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
    your brother's death, i know, sits at your heart;
    and you may marvel why i obscur'd myself,
    labouring to save his life, and would not rather
    make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r
    than let him so be lost. o most kind maid,
    it was the swift celerity of his death,

    whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
    your well-defended honour, you must pardon
    for mariana's sake; but as he adjudg'd your brother-
    being criminal in double violation

    thereon dependent, for your brother's life-

    should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
    her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
    and take her hence in horror.
  mariana. isabel,
    sweet isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
    hold up your hands, say nothing; i'll speak all.
    they say best men moulded out of faults;
    and, for the most, become much more the better
    for being a little bad; so may my husband.
    o isabel, will you not lend a knee?
  duke. he dies for claudio's death.
  isabella. [kneeling] most bounteous sir,
    look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
    as if my brother liv'd. i partly think
    a due sincerity govern'd his deeds
    till he did look on me; since it is so,
    let him not die. my brother had but justice,
    in that he did the thing for which he died;
    for angelo,
    his act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
    and must be buried but as an intent
    that perish'd by the way. thoughts are no subjects;
    intents but merely th
