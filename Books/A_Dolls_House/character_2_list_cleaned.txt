[CHARACTER] - 
                	a
lawyer who went to school with torvald and holds a subordinate position
at torvald's bank. [CHARACTER]'s character is contradictory: though
his bad deeds seem to stem from a desire to protect his children
from scorn, he is perfectly willing to use unethical tactics to
achieve his goals. his willingness to allow nora to suffer is despicable,
but his claims to feel sympathy for her and the hard circumstances
of his own life compel us to sympathize with him to some degree.
