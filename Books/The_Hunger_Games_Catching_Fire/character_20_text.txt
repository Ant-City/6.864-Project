combed sideways above his bright red face. ‚Äúthat stuff's too 
strong for you, girl.‚Äù he should know. next to haymitch, cray drinks more than anyone i've 
ever met. 

‚Äúaw, my mother uses it in medicines,‚Äù i say indifferently. 

‚Äúwell, it'd kill just about anything,‚Äù he says, and slaps down a coin for a bottle. 

when i reach greasy sae's  stall, i  boost  myself  up to sit on the  counter and order some 
soup, which looks to be some kind of gourd and bean mixture. a peacekeeper named darius 
comes up and buys a  bowl while i'm eating.  as  law enforcers go, he's one of  my  favorites. 
never  really  throwing  his  weight  around,  usually  good  for  a  joke.  he's  probably  in  his 
twenties, but he doesn't seem much older than i do. something about his smile, his red hair 
that sticks out every which way, gives him a boyish quality. 

‚Äúaren't you supposed to be on a train?‚Äù he asks me. 

‚Äúthey're collecting me at noon,‚Äù i answer. 

‚Äúshouldn't you look better?‚Äù he a

‚Äúno! we have to leave here before they kill us and a lot of other people, too!‚Äù i'm yelling 

again, but i can't understand why he's doing this. why doesn't he see what's so undeniable?

ines,  a  cruel  mouth.  gray  hair 
shaved  almost  to  nonexistence,  eyes  so  black  they  seem  all  pupils,  a  long,  straight  nose 
reddened by the freezing air. the powerful arm lifts again, his sights set on me. my hand flies 
to my shoulder, hungry for an arrow, but, of course, my weapons are stashed in the woods. i 
grit my teeth in anticipation of the next lash. 

‚Äúhold  it!‚Äù  a  voice  barks.  haymitch  appears  and  trips  over  a  peacekeeper  lying  on  the 
ground.  it's  darius.  a  huge  purple  lump  pushes  through  the  red  hair  on  his  forehead.  he's 
knocked out but still breathing. what happened? did he try to come to gale's aid before i got 
here? 

haymitch  ignores him and pulls  me to my  feet roughly.  ‚Äúoh, excellent.‚Äù his  hand  locks 
under my chin, lifting it. ‚Äúshe's got a photo shoot next week modeling wedding dresses. what 
am i supposed to tell her stylist?‚Äù 

i  see  a  flicker  of  recognition  in  the  eyes  of  the  man  with  the  wh

‚Äúvery well. get  your cousin out of here, then, girl.  and  if  he comes to, remind  him that 
the  next  time  he  poaches  off  the  capitol's  land,  i'll  assemble  that  firing  squad  personally.‚Äù 
the head peacekeeper wipes his hand along the length of the whip, splattering us with blood. 
then he coils it into quick, neat loops and walks off. 

most of the other peacekeepers fall in an awkward formation behind him. a small group 
stays behind and hoists darius's body up by the arms and legs. i catch purnia's eye and mouth 
the word ‚Äúthanks‚Äù before she goes. she doesn't respond, but i'm sure she understood. 

‚Äúgale.‚Äù  i  turn,  my  hands  fumbling  at  the  knots  binding  his  wrists.  someone  passes 

forward a knife and peeta cuts the ropes. gale collapses to the ground. 

‚Äúbetter get him to your mother,‚Äù says haymitch. 

there's no stretcher, but the old woman at the clothing stall sells us the board that serves 
as her countertop. ‚Ä

showed up, he'd been lashed at least forty times. he passed out around thirty. 

‚Äúlucky he only had the turkey on him,‚Äù says bristel. ‚Äúif he'd had his usual haul, would've 

been much worse.‚Äù 

‚Äúhe  told  thread  he  found  it  wandering  around  the  seam.  said  it  got over the  fence  and 
he'd stabbed  it with  a  stick. still  a crime. but  if they'd known  he'd  been  in the woods with 
weapons, they'd have killed him for sure,‚Äù says thom. 

‚Äúwhat about darius?‚Äù peeta asks. 

‚Äúafter  about  twenty  lashes,  he  stepped  in,  saying  that  was  enough.  only  he  didn't  do  it 
smart and official, like purnia did. he grabbed thread's arm and thread hit him in the head 
with the butt of the whip. nothing good waiting for him,‚Äù says bristel. 

‚Äúdoesn't sound like much good for any of us,‚Äù says haymitch.

began.  i  think  how  nice  it  is  to  have  a  friend  here.  i  notice  that the  young  man  beside  her, 
another avox, also has red hair. that must be what effie meant by a matched set. 

then  a  chill  runs  through  me.  because  i  know  him,  too.  not  from  the  capitol  but  from 
years of  having easy conversations  in the hob,  joking over greasy sae's  soup, and that last 
day watching him lie unconscious in the square while the life bled out of gale. 

our new avox is darius. 

 

 

 

haymitch  grips  my  wrist  as  if  anticipating  my  next  move,  but  i  am  as  speechless  as  the 
capitol's  torturers  have  rendered  darius.  haymitch  once  told  me  they  did  something  to 
avoxes' tongues so they could never talk again. in my head i hear darius's voice, playful and 
bright, ringing across the hob to tease me. not as my fellow victors make fun of me now, but 
because we genuinely liked each other. if gale could see him ... 

i know any move i would mak

e toward darius, any act of recognition, would only result 
in punishment for him. so we just stare into each other's eyes. darius, now a mute slave; me, 
now headed to death. what would we say, anyway? that we're sorry for the other's lot? that 
we ache for the other's pain? that we're glad we had the chance to know each other? 

no, darius shouldn't be glad he knew me. if i had been there to stop thread, he wouldn't 
have stepped forward to save gale. wouldn't be an avox. and more specifically, wouldn't be 
my avox, because president snow has so obviously had him placed here for my benefit. 

i twist  my  wrist  from  haymitch's  grasp  and  head  down to  my  old  bedroom,  locking  the 
door behind me. i sit on the side of my bed, elbows on my knees, forehead on my fists, and 
watch  my  glowing  suit  in  the  darkness,  imagi

ning  i  am  in  my  old  home  in  district  12, 
huddled beside the fire. it slowly fades back to black as the power pack dies out. 

when effie eventually knocks on the door to summon me to dinner, i get up and take off 
my suit, fold it neatly, and set it on the table with my crown. in the bathroom, i wash the dark 
streaks of makeup from my face. i dress in a simple shirt and pants and go down the hall to 
the dining room. 

i'm  not aware of  much at dinner except that darius and the redheaded  avox girl are our 
servers.  effie,  haymitch,  cinna,  portia,  and  peeta  are  all  there,  talking  about  the  opening 
ceremonies,  i  suppose.  but the  only  time  i  really  feel  present  is  when  i  purposely  knock  a 
dish  of  peas  to  the  floor  and,  before  anyone  can  stop  me,  crouch  down  to  clean  them  up. 
darius is right by me when i send the dish over, and we two are briefly side by side, obscured 
from view, as we scoop up the peas. for just o

ne moment our hands meet. i can feel his skin, 
rough under the buttery sauce from the dish. in the tight, desperate clench of our fingers are 
all  the  words  we  will  never  be  able  to  say.  then  effie's  clucking  at  me  from  behind  about 
how ‚Äúthat isn't your job, katniss!‚Äù and he lets go. 

when we go in to watch the recap of the opening ceremonies, i wedge myself in between 
cinna  and haymitch on the couch  because i don't want to be next to peeta. this awfulness 
with darius belongs to me and gale and maybe even haymitch, but not to peeta. he might've 
known  darius to nod hello, but peeta wasn't hob the way the rest of us were. besides, i'm 
still angry with him for laughing at me along with the other victors, and the last thing i want 
is his sympathy and comfort. i haven't changed my mind about saving him in the arena, but i 
don't owe him more than that. 

as i watch the procession to the city circle, i think how it's bad enough that they dress us 
all  up  in

off  to  bed.  effie  calls  a  reminder  to  meet  early  for  breakfast  to  work out our training 
strategy, but even  her voice sounds  hollow. poor effie. she  finally  had a decent year  in the 
games with peeta and me, and now it's all broken down into a mess that even she can't put a 
positive spin on. in capitol terms, i'm guessing this counts as a true tragedy. 

soon after i go to bed, there's a quiet knock on my door, but i ignore it. i don't want peeta 
tonight. especially not with darius around. it's almost as bad as if gale were here. gale. how 
am i supposed to let him go with darius haunting the hallways? 

tongues  figure  prominently  in  my  nightmares.  first  i  watch  frozen  and  helpless  while 
gloved  hands  carry  out the  bloody  dissection  in  darius's  mouth.  then  i'm  at  a  party  where 
everyone wears  masks and  someone with a  flicking, wet tongue, who i suppose  is  finnick, 
stalks me, but when he catches me and pulls off his mask, it's president snow

i  strip  off  my  sweaty  clothes  and  fall  back  into  bed,  naked,  and  somehow  find  sleep 
again. 

i delay going down to breakfast as long as possible the next morning because i really don't 
want  to  discuss  our  training  strategy.  what's  to  discuss?  every  victor  already  knows  what 
everybody else can do. or used to be able to do, anyway. so peeta and i will continue to act 
in  love  and  that's  that.  somehow  i'm  just  not  up to talking  about  it,  especially  with  darius 
standing mutely by. i take a long shower, dress slowly in the outfit cinna has left for training, 
and  order  food  from  the  menu  in  my  room  by  speaking  into  a  mouthpiece.  in  a  minute, 
sausage, eggs, potatoes, bread, juice, and hot chocolate appear. i eat my fill, trying to drag out 
the  minutes  until  ten  o'clock,  when  we  have  to  go  down  to  the  training  center.  by  nine-
thirty,  haymitch  is  pounding  on  my  door,  obviously  fed  up  with  me,  ordering  me  t

 things.  they  could  tell  by  sight  that  a 
force field had been put up between us and the gamemakers. and if we have to have allies, i 
want them.‚Äù i toss the ladle back in a pot of stew, splattering us both with the gravy. 

‚Äúwhat are you so angry about?‚Äù peeta asks, wiping the gravy from his shirtfront. ‚Äúbecause 

i teased you on the elevator? i'm sorry. i thought you would just laugh about it.‚Äù 

‚Äúforget it,‚Äù i say with a shake of my head. ‚Äúit's a lot of things.‚Äù 

‚Äúdarius,‚Äù he says. 

‚Äúdarius. the games. haymitch making us team up with the others,‚Äù i say. 

‚Äúit can just be you and me, you know,‚Äù he says. 

‚Äúi know. but maybe haymitch is right,‚Äù i say. ‚Äúdon't tell him i said so, but he usually is, 

where the games are concerned.‚Äù 

‚Äúwell,  you  can  have  final  say  about our  allies.  but right  now,  i'm  leaning  toward  chaff 

and seeder,‚Äù says peeta. 

‚Äúi'm okay with seeder, not chaff,‚Äù i say. ‚Äúnot yet, anyway.‚Äù 

‚Äúcome on

metal plates. but move where? 

i can't think straight. the image of cinna, beaten and bloody, consumes me. where is he 
now? what are they doing to him? torturing him? killing him? turning him into an avox? 
obviously  his  assault  was  staged  to  unhinge  me,  the  same  way  darius's  presence  in  my 
quarters was. and it has unhinged me. all i want to do is collapse on my metal plate. but i 
can hardly do that after what i just witnessed. i must be strong. i owe it to cinna, who risked 
everything  by  undermining  president  snow  and  turning  my  bridal  silk  into  mockingjay 
plumage. and i owe it to the rebels who, emboldened by cinna's example, might be fighting 
to  bring  down  the  capitol  at  this  moment.  my  refusal  to  play  the  games  on  the  capitol

i stretch out, pressing my hot cheek on the grass mat, staring at the thing in aggravation. 
peeta rubs a tense spot between my shoulders and i let myself relax a little. i wonder why this 
place  hasn't cooled off at all  now that the sun's gone down. i wonder what's going on  back 
home. 

prim. my mother. gale. madge. i think of them watching me from home. at least i hope 
they're at home. not taken into custody by thread. being punished as cinna is. as darius is. 
punished because of me. everybody. 

i  begin  to  ache  for  them,  for  my  district,  for  my  woods.  a  decent  woods  with  sturdy 
hardwood  trees,  plentiful  food,  game  that  isn't  creepy.  rushing  streams.  cool  breezes.  no, 
cold  winds  to  blow  this  stifling  heat  away.  i  conjure  up  such  a  wind  in  my  mind,  letting  it 
freeze my cheeks and numb my fingers, and all at once, the piece of metal half buried in the 
black earth has a name.
