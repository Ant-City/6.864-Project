his  son,  saying,  “don’t  worry,  your  mother  is  coming
soon.” i ignored him. he was blocking my view, the tears
clouding my vision as i tried to peer behind him, looking
down  the  block  to  see  if  that  familiar  brown  coat  and
white face would appear in the distance. it didn’t. in fact
there wasn’t anyone coming at all, except a bunch of kids
and they certainly didn’t look like mommy. they were a
motley crew of girls and boys, ragged, with wild hairdos
and unkempt jackets, hooting and making noise, and only
when they were almost upon me did i recognize the faces
of my elder siblings and my little sister kathy who trailed
behind them. i ran into their arms and collapsed in tears
as they gathered around me, laughing. 

my parents’ marriage was put together by a rov, a rabbi of a
high order who goes to each of the parents and sees about the
dowry and arranges the marriage contract properly according
to jewish law, which meant love had nothi

which time she would turn and fight back like an alley cat,
hissing, angry, and fearless. she had a casual way of ignor-
ing affronts, slipping past insults to her whiteness like a
seasoned boxer slips punches. when malcolm x, the sup-
posed  demon  of  the  white  man,  was  killed,  i  asked  her
who  he  was  and  she  said,  “he  was  a  man  ahead  of  his
time.” she actually liked malcolm x. she put him in near-
ly the same category as her other civil rights heroes, paul

randolph, martin luther king, jr., and the kennedys—
any kennedy. when malcolm x talked about “the white
devil” mommy simply felt those references didn’t apply to
her.  she  viewed  the  civil  rights  achievements  of  black
americans with pride, as if they were her own. and she
herself occasionally talked about “the white man” in the
third person, as if s

her lack of fear for her safety—particularly among blacks,
where she often stuck out like a sore thumb and seemed an
easy  target  for  muggers—had  me  stumped.  as  a  grown
man,  i  understand  now,  understand  how  her  christian
principles and trust in god kept her going through all her
life’s  battles,  but  as  a  boy,  my  faith  was  not  that  strong.
mommy once took me to harlem to visit my stepsister,
jacqueline, whom we called jack and who was my father’s
daughter  by  a  previous  marriage  and  more  like  an  aunt
than a sister. the two of them sat in jack’s parlor and talked
into the night while jack cooked big plates of soul food,
macaroni and cheese, sweet potato pies, and biscuits for us.

“take this home to the kids, ruth,” jack told ma. we put
the food in shopping bags and took it on the subway with-
out incident, but when we got off the bus in st. albans
near our house, two black men came up behind us an

  they  both  desperately  wrestled  for  the
purse,  whirling  from  the  sidewalk  into  the  dark  empty
street like two ballerinas locked in a death dance. i stood
frozen  in  shock,  watching.  finally  the  mugger  got  the
purse and ran off as his buddy laughed at him, and mommy
fell to the ground.

she got up, calmly took my hand, and began to walk

home without a word.

“you okay?” she asked me after a few moments.
i nodded. i was so frightened i couldn’t speak. all the
food that jack had cooked for us lay on the ground behind
us, ruined. “why didn’t you scream?” i asked, when i finally
got my tongue back.

“it’s just a purse,” she said. “don’t worry about it. let’s

just get home.”

the incident confirmed my fears that mommy was
always  in  danger.  every  summer  we  joined  the  poor
inner-city  kids  the  fresh  air  fund  organization  sent  to
host  families  or  to  summer  camps  for  free. the  luckier
ones among my siblings got to stay with host

was my own mother. the camp organizers
set up a table inside where they removed our shoes and
shirts and inspected our toes for athlete’s foot, checked us
for measles and chicken pox, then sent us outside to board
a yellow school bus for the long journey to upstate new
york.  as  i  sat  on  the  bus  peering  out  the  window  at
mommy, the only white face in a sea of black faces, a black
man walked up with his son. he had a mustache and a
goatee and wore black leather pants, a black leather jacket,
a ton of jewelry, and a black beret. he seemed outstand-
ingly cool. his kid was very handsome, well dressed, and
quite refined. he placed his kid’s bags in the back of the
bus and when the kid went to step on the bus, instead of
hugging the child, the father offered his hand, and father
and son did a magnificent, convoluted black-power soul
handshake called the “dap,” the kind of handshake that
lasts  five  minutes,  fingers  looping,  thumbs  up,  thumbs
down, index fingers collapsin
