ng that outside the baker's they had smelt the
goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious
thoughts of sage and onion, these young cratchits danced
about the table, and exalted master peter cratchit to the
skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked
him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up,
knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and
peeled.

"what has ever got your precious father then?" said mrs.
cratchit. "and your brother, tiny tim! and martha
warn't as late last christmas day by half-an-hour?"

"here's martha, mother!" said a girl, appearing as she
spoke.

"here's martha, mother!" cried the two young cratchits.
"hurrah! there's such a goose, martha!"

"why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!"
said mrs. cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off
her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.

"we'd a deal of work to finish up last night," replied the
girl, "and had to clear away t

"well! never mind so long as you are come," said mrs.
cratchit. "sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have
a warm, lord bless ye!"

"no, no! there's father coming," cried the two young
cratchits, who were everywhere at once. "hide, martha,
hide!"

so martha hid herself, and in came little bob, the father,
with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,
hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned
up and brushed, to look seasonable; and tiny tim upon his
shoulder. alas for tiny tim, he bore a little crutch, and
had his limbs supported by an iron frame!

"why, where's our martha?" cried bob cratchit, looking
round.

"not coming," said mrs. cratchit.

"not coming!" said bob, with a sudden declension in his
high spirits; for he had been tim's blood horse all the way
from church, and had come home rampant. "not coming
upon christmas day!"

martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only
in joke; so she came out p

rematurely from behind the closet
door, and ran into his arms, while the two young cratchits
hustled tiny tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,
that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.

"and how did little tim behave?" asked mrs. cratchit,
when she had rallied bob on his credulity, and bob had
hugged his daughter to his heart's content.

"as good as gold," said bob, "and better. somehow he
gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the
strangest things you ever heard. he told me, coming home,
that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he
was a crip

ple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember
upon christmas day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind
men see."

bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and
trembled more when he said that tiny tim was growing
strong and hearty.

his active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back
came tiny tim before another word was spoken, escorted by
his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while
bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were
capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot
mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round
and round and put it on the hob to simmer; master peter,
and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the
goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.

such a bustle ensued that you might have

 thought a goose
the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a
black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was
something very like it in that house. mrs. cratchit made
the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;
master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;
miss belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; martha dusted
the hot plates; bob took tiny tim beside him in a tiny
corner at the table; the two young cratchits set chairs for
everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard
upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest
they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be
helped. at last the dishes were set on, and grace was
said. it was succeeded by a breathless pause, as mrs.
cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared
to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the
long ex

pected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of
delight arose all round the board, and even tiny tim,
excited by the two young cratchits, beat on the table with
the handle of his knife, and feebly cried hurrah!

there never was such a goose. bob said he didn't believe
there ever was such a goose cooked. its tenderness and
flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal
admiration. eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,
it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as
mrs. cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small
atom of a bone upon the dish), t

called a circle, meaning half a one; and
at bob cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.
two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.

these held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as
golden goblets would have done; and bob served it out with
beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and
cracked noisily. then bob proposed:

"a merry christmas to us all, my dears. god bless us!"

which all the family re-echoed.

"god bless us every one!" said tiny tim, the last of all.

he sat very close to his father's side upon his little
stool. bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he
loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and
dreaded that he might be taken from him.

"spirit," said scrooge, with an interest he had never felt
before, "tell me if tiny tim will live."

"i see a vacant seat," replied the ghost, "in the poor
chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully
preserved. if these shadows remain unaltere

unfeeling man as mr. scrooge. you know he is, robert!
nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!"

"my dear," was bob's mild answer, "christmas day."

"i'll drink his health for your sake and the day's," said
mrs. cratchit, "not for his. long life to him! a merry
christmas and a happy new year! he'll be very merry and
very happy, i have no doubt!"

the children drank the toast after her. it was the first of
their proceedings which had no heartiness. tiny tim drank
it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it. scrooge
was the ogre of the family. the mention of his name cast
a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full
five minutes.

after it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than
before, from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done
with. bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his
eye for master peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full
five-and-sixpence weekly. the two young cratchi

and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a
good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at
home. also how she had seen a countess and a lord some
days before, and how the lord "was much about as tall as
peter;" at which peter pulled up his collars so high that you
couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. all this
time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and
by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in
the snow, from tiny tim, who had a plaintive little voice,
and sang it very well indeed.

there was nothing of high mark in this. they were not
a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes
were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty;
and peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside
of a pawnbroker's. but, they were happy, grateful, pleased
with one another, and contented with the time; and when
they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings
of the spirit'

s torch at parting, scrooge had his eye upon
them, and especially on tiny tim, until the last.

by this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty
heavily; and as scrooge and the spirit went along the streets,
the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and
all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. here, the flickering of
the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot
plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep
red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.
there all the children of the house were running out

p at peter,
who had a book before him. the mother and her daughters
were engaged in sewing. but surely they were very quiet!

"'and he took a child, and set him in the midst of
them.'"

where had scrooge heard those words? he had not
dreamed them. the boy must have read them out, as he
and the spirit crossed the threshold. why did he not
go on?

the mother laid her work upon the table, and put her
hand up to her face.

"the colour hurts my eyes," she said.

the colour? ah, poor tiny tim!

"they're better now again," said cratchit's wife. "it
makes them weak by candle-light; and i wouldn't show weak
eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. it
must be near his time."

"past it rather," peter answered, shutting up his book.
"but i think he has walked a little slower than he used,
these few last evenings, mother."

they were very quiet again. at last she said, and in a
steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:

"i have known him walk with--i have

 known him walk
with tiny tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed."

"and so have i," cried peter. "often."

"and so have i," exclaimed another. so had all.

"but he was very light to carry," she resumed, intent upon
her work, "and his father loved him so, that it was no
trouble: no trouble. and there is your father at the door!"

she hurried out to meet him; and little bob in his comforter
--he had need of it, poor fellow--came in. his tea
was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should
help him to

"why, that you were a good wife," replied bob.

"everybody knows that!" said peter.

"very well observed, my boy!" cried bob. "i hope they
do. 'heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. if i
can be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me
his card, 'that's where i live. pray come to me.' now, it
wasn't," cried bob, "for the sake of anything he might be
able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was
quite delightful. it really seemed as if he had known our
tiny tim, and felt with us."

"i'm sure he's a good soul!" said mrs. cratchit.

"you would be surer of it, my dear," returned bob, "if
you saw and spoke to him. i shouldn't be at all surprised--
mark what i say!--if he got peter a better situation."

"only hear that, peter," said mrs. cratchit.

"and then," cried one of the girls, "peter will be keeping
company with some one, and setting up for himself."

"get along with you!" retorted peter, grinning.

"it's just as likely as not," said

bob, "one of these days;
though there's plenty of time for that, my dear. but however
and whenever we part from one another, i am sure we
shall none of us forget poor tiny tim--shall we--or this
first parting that there was among us?"

"never, father!" cried they all.

"and i know," said bob, "i know, my dears, that when
we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he
was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among
ourselves, and forget poor tiny tim in doing it."

"no, never, father!" they all cried again.

"i am very happy," said little bob, "i am very happy!"

mrs. cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the
two young cratchits kissed him, and peter and himself shook
hands. spirit of tiny tim, thy childish essence was from
god!

"spectre," said scrooge, "something informs me that our
parting moment is at hand. i know it, but i know not
how. tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?"

direction where to take it. come back with the man, and
i'll give you a shilling. come back with him in less than
five minutes and i'll give you half-a-crown!"

the boy was off like a shot. he must have had a steady
hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.

"i'll send it to bob cratchit's!" whispered scrooge,
rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. "he sha'n't
know who sends it. it's twice the size of tiny tim. joe
miller never made such a joke as sending it to bob's
will be!"

the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady
one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to
open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer's
man. as he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker
caught his eye.

"i shall love it, as long as i live!" cried scrooge, patting
it with his hand. "i scarcely ever looked at it before.
what an honest expression it has in its face! it's

that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the
back. "a merrier christmas, bob, my good fellow, than i
have given you, for many a year! i'll raise your salary, and
endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss
your affairs this very afternoon, over a christmas bowl of
smoking bishop, bob! make up the fires, and buy another
coal-scuttle before you dot another i, bob cratchit!"


scrooge was better than his word. he did it all, and
infinitely more; and to tiny tim, who did not die, he was
a second father. he became as good a friend, as good a
master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or
any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old
world. some people laughed to see the alteration in him,
but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was
wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this
globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill
of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these

he had no further intercourse with spirits, but lived upon
the total abstinence principle, ever afterwards; and it was
always said of him, that he knew how to keep christmas

observed, god bless us, every one!
