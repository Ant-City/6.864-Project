"at yours and your family's!" replied bilbo, remembering his manners this time. 
"dwalin and balin here already, i see," said kili. "let us join the throng!" 
"throng!" thought mr. baggins. "i don't like the sound of that. i really must sit down for a 
minute and collect my wits, and have a drink." he had only just had a sip-in the corner, 
while the four dwarves sat around the table, and talked about mines and gold and 
troubles with the goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which 
he did not understand, and did not want to, for they sounded much too adventurous-
when, ding-dong-aling-' dang, his bell rang again, as if some naughty little hobbit-boy 
was trying to pull the handle off. "someone at the door!" he said, blinking. "some four, i 
should say by the sound," said fili. "be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in 
the distance." 
the poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in hi

th a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark 
business. 
"excitable little fellow," said gandalf, as they sat down again. "gets funny queer fits, but 
he is one of the best, one of the best-as fierce as a dragon in a pinch." 
if you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realise that this was only poetical 
exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to old took's greatgranduncle 
bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a horse. he charged the 
ranks of the goblins of mount gram in the battle of the green fields, and knocked their 
king gol-firnbul's head clean off with a wooden club. it sailed a hundred yards through 
the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of 
golf invented at the same moment. 
in the meanwhile, however, bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-
room. after a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour. this is what 
he heard, gloin speaking: "humph!" (o

"whatever were you doing there?" asked thorin with a shudder, and all the dwarves 
shivered. 
"never you mind. i was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it 
was. even i, gandalf, only just escaped. i tried to save your father, but it was too late. 
he was witless and wandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and 
the key." "we have long ago paid the goblins of moria," said thorin; "we must give a 
thought to the necromancer." "don't be absurd! he is an enemy quite beyond the 
powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be collected again from the four 
corners of the world. the one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map 
and use the key. the dragon and the mountain are more than big enough tasks for you!" 
"hear, hear!" said bilbo, and accidentally said it aloud, "hear what?" they all said turning 
suddenly towards

a good tale, and take a deal 
of telling anyway. they stayed long in that good house, fourteen days at least, and they 
found it hard to leave. bilbo would gladly have stopped there for ever and ever-even 
supposing a wish would have taken him right back to his hobbit-hole without trouble. yet 
there is little to tell about their stay. 
the master of the house was an elf-friend-one of those people whose fathers came into 
the strange stories before the beginning of history, the wars of the evil goblins and the 
elves and the first men in the north. in those days of our tale there were still some 
people who had both elves and heroes of the north for ancestors, and elrond the master 
of the house was their chief. he was as noble and as fair in face as an elf-lord, as strong 
as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as 
summer. he comes into. many tales, but his part in the story of bilbo's great adventure is 
only a small one, though important, as you w

oved with the best advice. so the 

time came to mid- summer eve, and they were to go on again with the early sun on 
midsummer morning. 
elrond knew all about runes of every kind. that day he looked at the swords they had 
brought from the trolls' lair, and he said: "these are not troll-make. they are old swords, 
very old swords of the high elves of the west, my kin. they were made in gondolin for 
the goblin-wars. they must have come from a dragon's hoard or goblin plunder, for 
dragons and goblins destroyed that city many ages ago. this, thorin, the runes name 
orcrist, the goblin-cleaver in the ancient tongue of gondolin; it was a famous blade. 
this, gandalf, was glamdring, foe-hammer that the king of gondolin once wore. keep 
them well!" 
"whence did the trolls get them, i wonder?" said thorin looking at his 
sword with new interest. 
"i could not say," said elrond, "but one may guess that your trolls had plundered other 
plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some ho

ld in the mountains of 
the north. i have heard that there are still forgotten treasures of old to be found in the 
deserted caverns of the mines of moria, since the dwarf and goblin war." 
thorin pondered these words. "i will keep this sword in honour," he said. 
"may it soon cleave goblins once again!" 
"a wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains!" said elrond. "but 
show me now your map!" he took it and gazed long at it, and he shook his head; for if he 
did not altogether approve of dwarves and their love of gold, he hated dragons and their 
cruel wickedness, and he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of dale and its merry 
bells, and the burned banks of the bright river running. the moon was shining in a 
broad silver crescent. he held up the map and

beyond. they had thought of coming to the secret door in the lonely mountain, perhaps 
that very next first moon of autumn-" and perhaps it will be durin's day" they had said. 
only gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing. dwarves had not passed that way 
for many years, but gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger had grown and 
thriven in the wild, since the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the goblins 
had spread in secret after the battle of the mines of moria. even the good plans of wise 
wizards like gandalf and of good friends like elrond go astray sometimes when you are 
off on dangerous adventures over the edge of the wild; and gandalf was a wise enough 
wizard to know it. 
he knew that something unexpected might happen, and he hardly dared to hope that 
they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonely 
peaks and valleys where no king ruled. they di

he dreamed that the floor of the cave was 
giving way, and he was slipping-beginning to fall down, down, goodness knows where 
to. 
at that he woke up with a horrible start, and found that part of his dream was true. a 
crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage. he was just 
in time to see the last of the ponies' tails disappearing into it. of course he gave a very 
loud yell, as loud a yell as a hobbit can give, which is surprising for their size. 
out jumped the goblins, big goblins, great ugly-looking goblins, lots of goblins, before 
you could say rocks and blocks. there were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even for 
bilbo; and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack, before you could say 
tinder and flint. but not gandalf. 
bilbo's yell had done that much good. it had wakened him up wide in a splintered 
second, and when goblins came to grab him, there was a terrible flash like lightning in 
the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several of

them fell dead. 
the crack closed with a snap, and bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it! 
where was gandalf? of that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, and the goblins 
did not wait to find out. it was deep, deep, dark, such as only goblins that have taken to 
living in the heart of the mountains can see through. the passages there were crossed 
and tangled in all directions, but the goblins knew their way, as well as you do to the 
nearest post-office; and the way went down and down, and it was most horribly stuffy. 
the goblins were very rough, and pinched unmercifully, and chuckled and laughed in 
their horrible stony voices; and bilbo was more unhappy even than when the troll had 
picked him up by his toes. he wished again and again for his nice bright hobbit-hole. not 
for the last time. 
now there came a glimmer of a red light before them. the goblins began to sing, or 
croak

, keeping time with the flap of their flat feet on the stone, and shaking their 
prisoners as well. 
 
"clap! snap! the black crack!

it sounded truly terrifying. the walls echoed to the clap, snap! and the crush, smash! and 
to the ugly laughter of their ho, ho! my lad! the general meaning of the song was only 
too plain; for now the goblins took out whips and whipped them with a swish, smack!, 
and set them running as fast as they could in front of them; and more than one of the 
dwarves were already yammering and bleating like anything, when they stumbled into a

big cavern. 
it was lit by a great red fire in the middle, and by torches along the walls, and it was full 
of goblins. they all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands, when the dwarves 
(with poor little bilbo at the back and nearest to the whips) came running in, while the 
goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their whips behind. the ponies were already there 
huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages and packages lying broken open, 
and being rummaged by goblins, and smelt by goblins, and fingered by goblins, and 
quarreled over by goblins. 
i am afraid that was the last they ever saw of those excellent little ponies, including a 
jolly sturdy little white fellow that elrond had lent to gandalf, since his horse was not 
suitable for the mountain-paths. for goblins eat horses and ponies and donkeys (and 
other much more dreadful things), and they are always hungry. just now however the 
prisoners were thinking only of themselves. the goblins chained their hands behind their

backs and linked them all together in a line and dragged them to the far end of the 
cavern with little bilbo tugging at the end of the row. 
there in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head, 
and armed goblins were standing round him carrying the axes and the bent swords that 
they use. now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted. 
they make no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. they can tunnel and 
mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take the trouble, though 
they are usually untidy and dirty. hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and 
also instruments of torture, they make very well, or get other people to make to their 
design, prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light. it is 
not unlikely that th

hands more than they could help; but in those days and those wild parts they had not 
advanced (as it is called) so far. they did not hate dwarves especially, no more than 
they hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in 
some parts wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them. but they had a special 
grudge against thorin's people, because of the war which you have heard mentioned, 
but which does not come into this tale; and anyway goblins don't care who they catch, as 
long as it is done smart and secret, and the prisoners are not able to defend 
themselves. 
"who are these miserable persons?" said the great goblin. 
"dwarves, and this!" said one of the drivers, pulling at bilbo's chain so that he fell 
forward onto his knees. 
"we found them sheltering in our front porch." 
"what do you mean by it?" said the great goblin turning to thorin. "up to no good, i'll

"thorin the dwarf at your service!" he replied-it was merely a polite nothing. "of the

further from our thoughts than inconveniencing goblins in any way whatever." that was 
true enough!

fact i should like to know all about you. not that it willdo you much good, thorin

were struck by lightning in the cave, when we invited these creatures to come below; 
and they are as dead as stones. also he has not explained this!" he held out the sword 
which thorin had worn, the sword which came from the trolls' lair. 
the great goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and all his 
soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. 
they knew the sword at once. it had killed hundreds of goblins in its time, when the fair 
elves of gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls. they had called 
it orcrist, goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply biter. they hated it and hated 
worse any one that carried it. 
"murderers' and elf-friends!" the great goblin shouted. "slash them! beat them! bite 
them! gnash them! take them away to dark holes full of snakes, and never let them see 
the light again!" he was in such a rage that he jumped off his seat and himself

 rushed at 
thorin with his mouth open. 
just at that moment all the lights in the cavern went out, and the great fire went off poof! 
into a tower of blue glowing smoke, right up to the roof, that scattered piercing white 
sparks all among the goblins. 
the yells and yammering, croaking, jibbering and jabbering; howls, growls and curses; 
shrieking and skriking, that followed were beyond description. 
several hundred wild cats and wolves being roasted slowly alive together would not 
have compared with it. the sparks were burning holes in the goblins, and the smoke that 
now fell from the roof made the air too thick for even their eyes to see through. soon 
they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the floor, biting and kick

d hands, and 
then off they all went at a run, with a clink-clink of chains, and many a stumble, since 
they had no hands to steady themselves with. not for a long while did they stop, and by 
that time they must have been right down in the very mountain's heart. 
then gandalf lit up his wand. of course it was gandalf; but just then they were too busy 
to ask how he got there. he took out his sword again, and again it flashed in the dark by 

itself. it burned with a rage that made it gleam if goblins were about; now it was bright as 
blue flame for delight in the killing of the great lord of the cave. it made no trouble 
whatever of cutting through the goblin-chains and setting all the prisoners free as quickly 
as possible. this sword's name was glamdring the foe-hammer, if you remember. the 
goblins just called it beater, and hated it worse than biter if possible. orcrist, too, had 
been saved; for gandalf had brought it along as well, snatching it from one of the 
terrified guards. ganda

could not do everything, 
he could do a great deal for friends in a tight comer. 
"are we all here?" said he, handing his sword back to thorin with a bow. 
"let me see: one-that's thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven; 
where are fili and kili? here they are, twelve, thirteenand here's mr. baggins: fourteen! 
well, well! it might be worse, and then again it might be a good deal better. no ponies, 
and no food, and no knowing quite where we are, and hordes of angry goblins just 
behind! on we go!" 
on they went. gandalf was quite right: they began to hear goblin noises and horrible 
cries far behind in the passages they had come through. that sent them on faster than 
ever, and as poor bilbo could not possibly go half as fast-for dwarves can roll along at a 
tremendous pace, i can tell you, when they have to-they took it in turn to carry him on 
their backs. 
still goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the way better (they had 
made the paths the

"why, o why did i ever leave my hobbit-hole!" said poor mr. baggins bumping up and 
down on bombur's back. 
"why, o why did i ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure hunt!" said poor 
bombur, who was fat, and staggered along with the sweat dripping down his nose in his 
heat and terror. 
at this point gandalf fell behind, and thorin with him. they turned a sharp corner. "about 
turn!" he shouted. "draw your sword, thorin!" 
there was nothing else to be done; and the goblins did not like it. they came scurrying 
round the corner in full cry, and found goblin-cleaver and foehammer shining cold and 
bright right in their astonished eyes. the ones in front dropped their torches and gave 
one yell before they were killed. the ones behind yelled still more, and leaped back 
knocking over those that were running after them. "biter and beater!" they shrieked; and 
soon they were all in confusion, and most of them were hustling back the way they had 
come.

long while before any of them dared to turn that comer. by that time the 
dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels of the goblins' 
realm. when the goblins discovered that, they put out their torches and they slipped on 
soft shoes, and they chose out their very quickest runners with the sharpest ears and 
eyes. these ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark, and with hardly any more noise 
than bats. 
that is why neither bilbo, nor the dwarves, nor even gandalf heard them coming. nor 
did they see them. but they were seen by the goblins that ran silently up behind, for 
gandalf was letting his wand give out a faint light to help the dwarves a

riddles in the dark 
 
when bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as with them 
shut. no one was anywhere near him. just imagine his fright! 
he could hear nothing, see nothing, and he could feel nothing except the stone of the 
floor. 
very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours, till he touched the wall of the tunnel; 
but neither up nor down it could he find anything: nothing at all, no sign of goblins, no 
sign of dwarves. his head was swimming, and he was far from certain even of the 
direction they had been going in when he had his fall. he guessed as well as he could, 
and crawled along for a good way, till suddenly his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of 
cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. it was a turning point in his career, but he did 
not know it. he put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did not seem 
of any particular use at the moment. he did

 not go much further, but sat down on the 
cold floor and gave himself up to complete miserableness, for a long while. he thought 
of himself frying bacon and eggs in his own kitchen at home - for he could feel inside 
that it was high time for some meal or other; but that only made him miserabler. 
he could not think what to do; nor could he think what had happened; or why he had 
been left behind; or why, if he had been left behind, the goblins had not caught him; or 
even why his head was so sore. the truth was he had been lying quiet, out of sight and 
out of mind, in a very dark corner for a long while. 
after some time he felt for his pipe. it was not broken, and that was something. then he 
felt for his pouch, and there was some tobacco in it, and that was something more. then 
he felt for matches and he could not find any at all, and that shattered his hopes 
completely. just as well for him, as he agreed when he came to his sen

ses. goodness 
knows what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco would have brought on him 
out of dark holes in that horrible place. still at the moment he felt very crushed. but in 
slapping all his pockets and feeling all round himself for matches his hand came on the 
hilt of his little sword - the little dagger that he got from the trolls, and that he had quite 
forgotten; nor do the goblins seem to have noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches. 
now he drew it out. it shone pale and dim before his eyes. "so it is an elvish blade, too," 
he thought; "and goblins are not very near, and yet not far enough." 
but somehow he was comforted. it was rather splendid to be wearing a blade made in 
gondolin for the goblin-wars of which so many songs had sung; and also he had noticed 
that such weapons made a great impression on goblins that came upon them suddenly. 
"go back?" he though

ard? only 
thing to do! on we go!" so up he got, and trotted along with his little sword held in front 
of him and one hand feeling the wall, and his heart all of a patter and a pitter. 
now certainly bilbo was in what is called a tight place. but you must remember it was 
not quite so tight for him as it would have been for me or for you. hobbits are not quite 
like ordinary people; and after all if their holes are nice cheery places and properly aired, 
quite different from the tunnels of the goblins, still they are more used to tunnelling than 
we are, and they do not easily lose their sense of direction underground-not when their 
heads have recovered from being bumped. also they can move very quietly, and hide 
easily, and recover wonderfully from falls and bruises, and they have a fund of wisdom 
and wise sayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago. 

i should not have liked to have been in mr. baggins' place, all the same. 
the tunnel seemed to have no end. all

 he knew was that it was still going down pretty 
steadily and keeping in the same direction in spite of a twist and a turn or two. there 
were passages leading off to the side every now and then, as he knew by the glimmer of 
his sword, or could feel with his hand on the wall. of these he took no notice, except to 
hurry past for fear of goblins or half-imagined dark things coming out of them. on and on 
he went, and down and down; and still he heard no sound of anything except the 
occasional whirr of a bat by his ears, which startled him at first, till it became too frequent 
to bother about. i do not know how long he kept on like this, hating to go on, not daring 
to stop, on, on, until he was tireder than tired. it seemed like all the way to tomorrow and 
over it to the days beyond. 
suddenly without any warning he trotted splash i

o wade out into the darkness. he could not swim; and he thought, 
too, of nasty slimy things, with big bulging blind eyes, wriggling in the water. there are 
strange things living in the pools and lakes in the hearts of mountains: fish whose fathers 
swam in, goodness only knows how many years ago, and never swam out again, while 
their eyes grew bigger and bigger and bigger from trying to see in the blackness; also 
there are other things more slimy than fish. even in the tunnels and caves the goblins 
have made for themselves there are other things living unbeknown to them that have 
sneaked in from outside to lie up in the dark. some of these caves, too, go back in their 
beginnings to ages before the goblins, who only widened them and joined them up with 
passages, and the original owners are still there in odd comers, slinking and nosing 
about. 
deep down here by the dark water lived old gollum, a small slimy creature. i don't know 
where he came from, nor who or what he was. he was gol

s were all he could think of. asking them, and sometimes guessing them, had 
been the only game he had ever played with other funny creatures sitting in their holes in 
the long, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven away, alone, and crept 
down, down, into the dark under the mountains. 
"very well," said bilbo, who was anxious to agree, until he found out more about the 
creature, whether he was quite alone, whether he was fierce or hungry, and whether he 
was a friend of the goblins. 
"you ask first," he said, because he had not had time to think of a riddle. 
so gollum hissed: 
 
"what has roots as nobody sees, 
is taller than trees, 
up, up it goes, 
and yet never grows?" 
 
"easy!" said bilbo. "mountain, i suppose." 
"does it guess easy? it must have a competition with us, my preciouss! if precious asks, 
and it doesn't answer, we eats it, my preciousss. if it asks us, and we doesn't answer, 
then we does what it wants, eh? we shows it the way out, yes!" 
"all right!" s

bilbo seeing what had happened and having nothing better to ask stuck to his question. 
"what have i got in my pocket?" he said louder. 
"s-s-s-s-s," hissed gollum. "it must give us three guesseses, my preciouss, three 
guesseses." 
"very well! guess away!" said bilbo. 
"handses!" said gollum. 
"wrong," said bilbo, who had luckily just taken his hand out again. "guess again!" 
"s-s-s-s-s," said gollum more upset than ever. he thought of all the things he kept in his 
own pockets: fishbones, goblins' teeth, wet shells, a bit of bat-wing, a sharp stone to 
sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things. he tried to think what other people kept in 
their pockets. 
"knife!" he said at last. 
"wrong!" said bilbo, who had lost his some time ago. "last guess!" 
now gollum was in a much worse state than when bilbo had asked him the egg-
question. he hissed and spluttered and rocked himself backwards and forwards, and 
slapped his feet on the floor, and wriggled and squirmed; but still he did not da

perhaps even the master who ruled them could not have said. gollum used to wear it at 
first, till it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin, till it galled him; and now 
usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was always going back to look at 
it. and still sometimes he put it on, when he could not bear to be parted from it any 
longer, or when he was very, very, hungry, and tired of fish. then he would creep along 
dark passages looking for stray goblins. he might even venture into places where the 
torches were lit and made his eyes blink and smart; for he would be safe. 
oh yes, quite safe. no one would see him, no one would notice him, till he had his 
fingers on their throat. only a few hours ago he had worn it, and caught a small goblin-
imp. how it squeaked! he still had a bone or two left to gnaw, but he wanted something 
softer. 
"quite safe, yes," he whispered to himself. "it won't see us, will it, my precious? no. it

door. to the back-door, that's it." 
"the goblinses will catch it then. it can't get out that way, precious." 
"ssss, sss, gollum! goblinses! yes, but if it's got the present, our precious present, then 
goblinses will get it, gollum! they'll find it, they'll find out what it does. we shan't ever be 
safe again, never, gollum! one of the goblinses will put it on, and then no one will see 
him. he'll be there but not seen. not even our clever eyeses will notice him; and he'll 
come creepsy and tricksy and catch us, gollum, gollum!"

ent, gollum flip-flapping ahead, hissing and cursing; bilbo behind going as 
softly as a hobbit can. soon they came to places where, as bilbo had noticed on the way 
down, side-passages opened, this way and that. 
gollum began at once to count them. 
"one left, yes. one right, yes. two right, yes, yes. two left, yes, yes." and so on and on. 
as the count grew he slowed down, and he began to get shaky and weepy; for he was 
leaving the water further and further behind, and he was getting afraid. goblins might be 
about, and he had lost his ring. at last he stopped by a low opening, on their left as they 
went up. 
"seven right, yes. six left, yes!" he whispered. "this is it. this is the way to the back-
door, yes. here's the passage!" 
he peered in, and shrank back. "but we durstn't go in, precious, no we durstn't.

"what shall we do? curse them and crush them! we must wait here, precious, wait a bit

so they came to a

all at once there came a 
bloodcurdling shriek, filled with hatred and despair. gollum was defeated. he dared go 
no further. he had lost: lost his prey, and lost, too, the only thing he had ever cared for, 
his precious. 
the cry brought bilbo's heart to his mouth, but still he held on. now faint as an echo, but 
menacing, the voice came behind: 
"thief, thief, thief! baggins! we hates it, we hates it, we hates it for ever!" 
then there was a silence. but that too seemed menacing to bilbo. "if goblins are so near 
that he smelt them," he thought, "then they'll have heard his shrieking and cursing. 
careful now, or this way will lead you to worse things." 
the passage was low and roughly made. it was not too difficult for the hobbit, except 
when, in spite of all care, he stubbed his poor toes again, several times, on nasty jagged 
stones in the floor. "a bit low for goblins, at least for the big ones," thought bilbo, not 
knowing that even the big ones, the ores of the mountains, go along at

und another corner-a glimpse of light. not red light, as of fire or lantern, 
but a pale out-ofdoors sort of light. then bilbo began to run. 
scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner and came 
suddenly right into an open space, where the light, after all that time in the dark, seemed 
dazzlingly bright. really it was only a leak of sunshine in through a doorway, where a 
great door, a stone door, was left standing open. 
bilbo blinked, and then suddenly he saw the goblins: goblins in full armour with drawn 
swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes, and watching the 
passage that led to it. they were aroused, alert, ready for anything. 

they saw him sooner than he saw them. yes, they saw him. whether it was an accident, 
or a last trick of the ring before it took a new master, it was not on his finger. with yells of 
delight the goblins rushed upon him. 
a pang of fear and loss, like an echo of gollum's misery, smote bilbo, and forget

even to draw his sword he struck his hands into his pockets. 
and- there was the ring still, in his left pocket, and it slipped on his finger. the goblins 
stopped short. they could not see a sign of him. he had vanished. they yelled twice as 
loud as before, but not so delightedly. 
"where is it?" they cried. 
"go back up the passage!" some shouted. 
"this way!" some yelled. "that way!" others yelled. 
"look out for the door," bellowed the captain. 
whistles blew, armour clashed, swords rattled, goblins cursed and swore and ran hither 
and thither, falling over one another and getting very angry. 
there was a terrible outcry, to-do, and disturba

bilbo was dreadfully frightened, but he had the sense to understand what had happened 
and to sneak behind a big barrel which held drink for the goblinguards, and so get out of 
the way and avoid being bumped into, trampled to death, or caught by feel. 
"i must get to the door, i must get to the door!" he kept on saying to himself, but it was a 
long time before he ventured to try. then it was like a horrible game of blind-man's buff. 
the place was full of goblins running about, and the poor little hobbit dodged this way 
and that, was knocked over by a goblin who could not make out what he had bumped 
into, scrambled away on all fours, slipped between the legs of the captain just in time, 
got up, and ran for the door. 
it was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it nearly to. bilbo struggled but he could not 
move it. he tried to squeeze through the crack. he squeezed and squeezed, and he 
stuck! it was awful. his buttons had got wedged on the edge of t

post. he could see outside into the open air: there were a few steps running down into a 
narrow valley between tall mountains; the sun came out from behind a cloud and shone 
bright on the outside of the door-but he could not get through. 
suddenly one of the goblins inside shouted: "there is a shadow by the door. something 
is outside!" 
bilbo's heart jumped into his mouth. he gave a terrific squirm. buttons burst off in all 
directions. he was through, with a torn coat and waistcoat, leaping down the steps like a 
goat, while bewildered goblins were still picking up his nice brass buttons on the 
doorstep. 
of course they soon came down after him, hooting and hallooing, and hunting among 
the trees. but they don't like the sun: it makes their legs wobble

and their heads giddy. 
they could not find bilbo with the ring on, slipping in and out of the shadow of the trees, 
running quick and quiet, and keeping out of the sun; so soon they went back grumbling 
and cursing to guard the door. bilbo had escaped. 
 
chapter 6 
out of the frying-pan into the fire 
 
bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was. he had lost hood, 
cloak, food, pony, his buttons and his friends. he wandered on and on, till the sun began 
to sink westwards-behind the mountains. their shadows fell across bilbo's path, and he 
looked back. then he looked forward and could see before him only ridges and slopes 
falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed occasionally between the trees. 

"good heavens!" he exclaimed. "i seem to have got right to the other side of the misty 
mountains, ri

the dwarves have got to? i only hope to goodness they are not still back there in the 
power of the goblins!" 
he still wandered on, out of the little high valley, over its edge, and down the slopes 
beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing inside him. he 
wondered whether he ought not, now he had the magic ring, to go back into the horrible, 
horrible, tunnels and look for his friends. he had just made up his mind that it was his 
duty, that he must turn back-and very miserable he felt about it-when he heard voices. 
he stopped and listened. it did not sound like goblins; s

unpleasant, and he saw that balin was looking straight at him without noticing him. 
"i will give them all a surprise," he thought, as he crawled into the bushes at the edge of 
the dell. gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. they were discussing all that had 
happened to them in the tunnels, and wondering and debating what they were to do 
now. the dwarves were grumbling, and gandalf was saying that they could not possibly 
go on with their journey leaving mr. baggins in the hands of the goblins, without trying to 
find out if he was alive or dead, and without trying to rescue him. 
"after all he is my friend," said the wizard, "and not a bad little chap. 
i feel responsible for him. i wish to goodness you had not lost him." 
the dwarves wanted to know why he had ever been brought at all, why he could not 
stick to his friends and come along with them, and why the wizard had not chosen 
someone with more sense. "he has been more trouble than use so far," said one. "if we 
have got to'

over. whatever did you want to go and drop him for, dori?" 
"you would have dropped him," said dori, "if a goblin had suddenly grabbed your leg 
from behind in the dark, tripped up your feet, and kicked you in the back!" 
"then why didn't you pick him up again?" 
"good heavens! can you ask! goblins fighting and biting in the dark, everybody falling 
over bodies and hitting one another! you nearly chopped off my head with glamdring, 
and thorin was stabbing here there and everywhere with orcrist. all of a sudden you 
gave one of your blinding flashes, and we saw the goblins running back yelping. you 
shouted 'follow me everybody!' and everybody ought to have followed. we thought 
everybody had. there was no time to count, as you know quite well, till we had dashed 
through the gate-guards,

as he said this, and 
the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out. 
then he had questions of his own to ask, for if gandalf had explained it all by now to the 
dwarves, bilbo had not heard it. he wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, 
and where they had all got to now. 
the wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more than once, so 
now he had told bilbo that both he and elrond had been well aware of the presence of 
evil goblins in that part of the mountains. but their main gate used to come out on a 
different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that they often caught people benighted 
near their gates. evidently people had given up going that way, and the goblins must 
have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken, quite 
recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now. 
"i must see if i can't find a more or less decent giant to block it up again," said gandalf, 
"or soon there
 
 ___________________________
 
 will be no getting over the mountains at all." 
as soon as gandalf had heard bilbo's yell he realized what had happened. 
in the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside the 
crack, just as it snapped to. he followed after the drivers and prisoners right to the edge 
of the great hall, and there he sat down and worked up the best magic he could in the 
shadows. 

"a very ticklish business, it was," he said. "touch and go!" 
but, of course, gandalf had made a special study of bewitchments with fire and lights 
(even the hobbit had never forgotten the magic fireworks at old took's midsummer-eve 
parties, as you remembe

r). the rest we all know - except that gandalf knew all about the 
back-door, as the goblins called the lower gate, where bilbo lost his buttons. as a matter 
of fact it was well known to anybody who was acquainted with this part of the mountains; 
but it took a wizard to keep his head in the tunnels and guide them in the right 
direction. 
"they made that gate ages ago," he said, "partly for a way of escape, if they needed 
one; partly as a way out into the lands beyond, where they still come in the dark and do 
great damage. they guard it always and no one has ever managed to block i

o which our pass would have brought us; we are too far to the north, and 
have some awkward country ahead. and we are still pretty high up. let's get on!" 
"i am so dreadfully hungry," groaned bilbo, who was suddenly aware that he had not 
had a meal since the night before the night before last. just think of that for a hobbit! his 
stomach felt all empty and loose and his legs all wobbly, now that the excitement was 
over. 
"can't help it," said gandalf, "unless you like to go back and ask the goblins nicely to let 
you have your pony back and your luggage." 
"no thank you!" said bilbo. 
"very well then, we must just tighten our belts and trudge on - or we shall be made into 
supper, and that will be much worse than having none ourselves." 
as they went on bilbo looked from side to side for something to eat; but the blackberries 
were still only in flower, and of course there were no nuts, nor even hawthorn-berries. he 
nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a small mountain-stream that

untain slope from the deeper darker forests 
of the valleys below. some caught hold of the trunks and swung themselves into lower 
branches, some (like the little hobbit) got behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of 
the rocks. soon the danger was over, the slide had stopped, and the last faint crashes 
could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding and spinning 
among the bracken and the pine-roots far below. 
"well! that has got us on a bit," said gandalf; "and even goblins tracking us will have a 
job to come down here quietly." 
"i daresay," grumbled bombur; "but they won't find it difficult to send stones bouncing 
down on our heads." the dwarves (and bilbo) were feeling far from happy, and were 
rubbing their bruised and damaged legs and feet. 
"nonsense! we are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide. 
we must be quick! look at the light!" the sun had long gone behind the mountains. 
already the shadows were deepening about them, though far away

 he knew that noise. he 
had had it described to him often enough in tales. one of his elder cousins (on the took 
side), who had been a great traveller, used to imitate it to frighten him. to hear it out in 
the forest under the moon was too much for bilbo. even magic rings are not much use 
against wolvesespecially against the evil packs that lived under the shadow of the 
goblininfested mountains, over the edge of the wild on the borders of the unknown. 
wolves of that sort smell keener than goblins, and do not need to see you to catch you! 
"what shall we do, what shall we do!" he cried. "escaping goblins to be caught by 
wolves!" he said, and it became a proverb, though we now say 'out of the frying-pan into 
the fire' in the same sort of uncomfortable situations. 
"up the trees quick!" cried gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade, 
hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or were slender enough to swarm up. 
they found them as quick as ever they could, you ca

 of the circle was a great grey 
wolf. he spoke to them in the dreadful language of the wargs. gandalf understood it. 
bilbo did not, but it sounded terrible to him, and as if all their talk was about cruel and 
wicked things, as it was. every now and then all the wargs in the circle would answer 
their grey chief all together, and their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of 
his pine-tree. 
i will tell you what gandalf heard, though bilbo did not understand it. 
the wargs and the goblins often helped one another in wicked deeds. goblins do not 
usually venture very far from their mountains, unless they are driven out and are looking 
for new homes, or are marching to war (which i am glad to say has not happened for a 
long while). but in those days they sometimes used to go on raids, especially to get food 
or slaves to work for them. then they often got the wargs to help and shared the 
plunder with them. sometimes they rode on wolves like men do on horses. now it 
seemed that
 
 ___________________________
 
 a great goblin-raid had been planned for that very night. the wargs had 
come to meet the goblins and the goblins were late. the reason, no doubt, was the 
death of the great goblin, and all the excitement caused by the dwarves and bilbo and 
the wizard, for whom they were probably still hunting. 

in spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their way back 
into it from the south, cutting down trees, and building themselves places to live in 
among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the river-shores. there were 
many of them, and they were brave and wellarmed, a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd even the wargs dared not 
attack them if there were many together, or in the bright day. but now they had planned 
with the goblins' help to come by night upon some of the villages nearest the mountains. 
if their plan had been carried out, there would have been none left there next day; all 
would have been killed except the few the goblins kept from the wolves and carried back 
as prisoners to their caves. 
this was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen and their 
wives and children, but also because of the danger which now threatened gandalf and 
his friends. the wargs were angry and puzzled at finding them here in their very 
meeting-place. they thought they were friends of the woodmen, and were come to spy 
on them, and would take news of their plans down into the valleys, and then the goblins 
and

the wolves would have to fight a terrible battle instead of capturing prisoners and 
devouring people waked suddenly from their sleep. so the wargs had no intention of 
going away and letting the people up the trees escape, at any rate not until morning. and 
long before that, they said, goblin soldiers would be coming down from the mountains; 
and goblins can climb trees, or cut them down. 
now you can understand why gandalf, listening to their growling and yelping, began to 
be dreadfully afraid, wizard though he was, and to feel that they were in a very bad 
place, and had not yet escaped at all. all the same he was not going to let them have it 
all their own way, though he could not do very much stuck up in a tall tree with wolves all 
round on the ground below. 
he gathered the huge pinecones from the branches of his tree. then he set one a

"what's all this uproar in the forest tonight?" said the lord of the eagles. he was sitting, 
black in the moonlight, on the top of a lonely pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the 
mountains. "i hear wolves' voices! 
are the goblins at mischief in the woods?" 
he swept up into the air, and immediately two of his guards from the rocks at either hand 
leaped up to follow him. they circled up in the sky and looked down upon the ring of the 
wargs, a tiny spot far far below. but eagles have keen eyes and can see small things at 
a great distance. the lord of the eagles of the misty mountains had eyes that could look 
at the sun unblinking, and could see a rabbit moving on the ground a mile below even in 
the moonlight. so thou

and yelping come up faint from far beneath him. also he could see the glint of the moon 
on goblin spears and helmets, as long lines of the wicked folk crept down the hillsides 
from their gate and wound into the wood. 
eagles are not kindly birds. some are cowardly and cruel. but the ancient race of the 
northern mountains were the greatest of all birds; they were proud and strong and noble-
hearted. they did not love goblins, or fear them. when they took any notice of them at 
all (which was seldom, for they did not eat such creatures ), they swooped on them and 
drove them shrieking back to their caves, and stopped whatever wickedness they were 
doing. the goblins hated the eagles and feared them, but could not reach their lofty 
seats, or drive them from the mountains. 
tonight the lord of the eagles was filled with curiosity to know what was afoot; so he 
summoned many other eagles to him, and they flew away fro

slowly circling ever round and round they came down, down, down towards the ring of 
the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins. 
a very good thing too! dreadful things had been going on down there. the wolves that 
had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places. it was high 
summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some 
time. yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-needles, and here and there 
dead trees, were soon in flames. 
all round the clearing of the wargs fire was leaping. but the wolf-guards did not leave 
the trees. maddened and

 angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and 
cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out, and their 
eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames. 
then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. they thought a battle with the woodmen 
was going on; but they goon learned what had really happened. some of them actually 
sat down and laughed. others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their 
shields. goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them 
most amusing. 
some got all the wolves together in a pack. some stacked fern and brushwood round 
the tree-trunks. others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, 
until nearly all the flames were put out-but they did not put out the fire nearest to the 
trees where the dwarves were. that fire they fed with leaves and dead branches and 
bracken. soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, a
 
 ___________________________
 
 ring which 
they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was licking 
the fuel piled under the trees. smoke was in bilbo's eyes, he could feel the heat of the 
flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a 
circle like people round a midsummer bonfire. outside the ring of dancing warriors with 
spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting. 
he could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song: 
 
"fifteen birds in five firtrees, 
their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze! 
but, funny little birds, they had no wings! 
o what shall we do with the funny little things? 
roast 'em alive, or stew them in a pot; 
fry them, boil them and eat them hot?" 
 
then they stopped and shouted out: "fly away little birds! fly away if you can! come 
down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! sing, sing little birds! why don't 
you sing?"

and with that ya hoy! the flames were under gandalf's tree. in a moment it spread to the 
others. the bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked. 
then gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. the sudden splendour flashed from his 
wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears 
of the goblins. that would have been the end of him, though he would probably have 
killed many of them as he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt. but he never leaped. 
just at that moment the lord of the eagles swept down from above, seized him in his 
talons, and was gone. 
there was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. loud cried the lord of the 
eagles, to whom gandalf had now spoken. back swept the great birds that were with 
him, and down they came like huge black shadows. the wolves yammere

air in vain. over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote 
them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. other birds 
flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as 
ever they dared to go.

now far below the goblins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the woods. a

the flames about the trees sprang suddenly up above the highest branches. they went 
up in crackling fire. there was a sudden flurry of sparks and smoke. bilbo had escaped

others sitting with their backs to the 
mountain wall. the lord of the eagles also was there and was speaking to gandalf. 
it seemed that bilbo was not going to be eaten after all. the wizard and the eagle-lord 
appeared to know one another slightly, and even to be on friendly terms. as a matter of 
fact gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, had once rendered a service to the 
eagles and healed their lord from an arrow-wound. so you see 'prisoners' had meant 
'prisoners rescued from the goblins' only, and not captives of the eagles. as bilbo 
listened to the talk of gandalf he realized that at last they were going to escape really 
and truly from the dreadful mountains. he was discussing plans with the great 
eagle for carrying the dwarves and himself and bilbo far away and setting them 
down well on their journey across the plains below. 
the lord of the eagles would not take them anywhere near where men lived. 
"they would shoot at us with their great bows of yew," he said, "for the

obliged to you. but in the meantime we are famished with hunger."

over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are thorin (son of thrain, son of thror, i 
believe), and that your companion is respectable, and that you are enemies of goblins 
and are not up to any mischief in my lands-what are you up to, by the way?" 
"they are on their way to visit the land of their fathers, away east beyond mirkwood," put 
in gandalf, "and it is entirely an accident that we are in your lands at all. we were 
crossing by the high pass that should have brought us to the road that lies to the south 
of your country, when we were attacked by the evil goblins-as i was about to tell you." 
"go on telling, then!" said beorn, who was never very polite.

you remember, gandalf had told them to come in pairs every five minutes. 
"hullo!" said beorn. "you came pretty quick-where were you hiding? come on my jack-
in-the-boxes!" 
"nori at your service, ori at . . ." they began; but beorn interrupted them. 
"thank you! when i want your help i will ask for it. sit down, and let's get on with this 
tale, or it will be supper-time before it is ended." 
"as soon as we were asleep," went on gandalf, "a crack at the back of the cave opened; 
goblins came out and grabbed the hobbit and the dwarves and our troop of ponies-" 
"troop of ponies? what were you-a travelling circus? or were you carrying lots of 
goods? or do you always call six a troop?" 
"o no! as a matter of fact there were more than six ponies, for there were more than six 
of us-and well, here are two more!" just at that moment balin and dwalin appeared and 
bowed so low that their beards swept the stone floor. the big man was frowning at first, 
but they did their very best t

"balin and dwalin," they said not daring to be offended, and sat flop on the floor looking 
rather surprised. 
"now go on again!" said beorn to the wizard. 
"where was 1? o yes- i was not grabbed. i killed a goblin or two with a flash-" 
"good!" growled beorn. "it is some good being a wizard, then." 
"-and slipped inside the crack before it closed. i followed down into the main hall, which 
was crowded with goblins. the great goblin was there with thirty or forty armed guards. 
i thought to myself 'even if they were not all chained together, what can a dozen do 
against so many?' " 
"a dozen! that's the first time i've heard eight called a dozen. or have you still got some 
more jacks that haven't yet come out of their boxes?" 
"well, yes, there seem to be a couple more here now - fili and kili, i believe," said 
gandalf, as these two now appeared and stood smiling and bowing. 
"that's enough!" said beorn

their climbing into trees with the wolves all underneath, he got up and strode about 
and muttered: 
"i wish i had been there! i would have given them more than fireworks!" 
"well," said gandalf very glad to see that his tale was making a good impression, "i did 
the best i could. there we were with the wolves going mad underneath us and the forest 
beginning to blaze in places, when the goblins came down from the hills and discovered 
us. they yelled with delight and sang songs making fun of us. fifteen birds in five fir-
trees..." 
"good heavens!" growled beorn. "don't pretend that goblins can't count. 
they can. twelve isn't fifteen and they know it." 
"and so do 1. there were bifur and bofur as well. i haven't ventured to introduce them 
before, but here they are." 
in came bifur and bofur. "and me!" gasped bombur pulling up behind. he was fat, and

after the other two. 
"well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, i suppose that is all that 
there were up the trees. now perhaps we can finish this story without any more 
interruptions." mr. baggins saw then how clever gandalf had been. the interruptions 

had really made beorn more interested in the story, and the story had kept him from 
sending the dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars. he never invited people into his 
house, if he could help it. he had very few friends and they lived a good way away; and 
he never invited more than a

they went straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the misty 
mountains, where we had our pleasant little party with the wargs the night before last. 
and now i think i have answered your first question, too," ended gandalf, and he sat a 
long while silent. 
bilbo thought he knew what the wizard meant. "what shall we do," he cried, "if he leads 
all the wargs and the goblins down here? we shall all be caught and killed! i thought 
you said he was not 9 friend of theirs." 

"so i did. and don't be silly! you had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy." 
the hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did go to bed; 
and while the dwarves were still singing songs he dropped asleep, still puzzling his little 
head about beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of black bears dancing slow 
heavy dances round and round in the moonlight in the

 courtyard. then he woke up when 
everyone else was asleep, and he heard the same scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and 
growling as before. next morning they were all wakened by beorn himself. 
"so here you all are still!" he said. he picked up the hobbit and laughed: "not eaten up 
by wargs or goblins or wicked bears yet i see"; and he poked mr. baggins' waistcoat 
most disrespectfully. "little bunny is getting nice and fat again on bread and honey," he 
chuckled. "come and have some more!" 
so they all went to breakfast with him. beorn was most jolly for a change; indeed he 
seemed to be in a splendidly good humour and set them all laughing with his funny 
stories; nor did they have to wonder long where he had been or why he was so nice to 
them, for he told them himself. he had been over t

they were no longer making for the main 
forest-road to the south of his land. had they followed the pass, their path would have 
led them down the stream from the mountains that joined the great river miles south of 
the carrock. at that point there was a deep ford which they might have passed, if they 
had still had their ponies, and beyond that a track led to the skirts of the wood and to the 
entrance of the old forest road. but beorn had warned them that that way was now often 
used by the goblins, while the forest-road itself, he bad heard, was overgrown and 
disused at the eastern end and led to impassable marshes where the paths had long 
been lost. its eastern opening had also always been far to the south of the lonely 
mountain, and would have left them still with a long and difficult northward march when 
they got to the other side. 
north of the carrock the edge of mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the great river, 
and though here the mountains too drew down nearer, beorn ad

vised them to take this 
way; for at a place a few days' ride due north of the carrock was the gate of a little-
known pathway through mirkwood that led almost straight towards the lonely mountain. 
"the goblins," beorn had said, "will not dare to cross the great river for a hundred miles 
north of the carrock nor to come near my house - it is well protected at night!- but i 
should ride fast; for if they make their raid soon they will cross the river to the south and 
scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you off, and wargs run swifter than ponies. 
still you are safer going north, even though you seem to be going back nearer to their 
strongholds; for that is what they will least expect, and

they will have the longer ride to 
catch you. be off now as quick as you may!" 
that is why they were now riding in silence, galloping wherever the ground was grassy 
and smooth, with the mountains dark on their left, and in the distance the line of the river 
with its trees drawing ever closer. the sun had only just turned west when they started, 
and till evening it lay golden on the land about them. it was difficult to think of pursuing 
goblins behind, and when they had put many miles between them and beorn's house 
they began to talk and to sing again and to forget the dark forest-path that lay in front. 
but in the evening when the dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains glowered 
against the sunset they made a camp and set a guard, and most of them slept uneasily 
with dreams in which there came the howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins. 
still the next morning dawned bright and fair again.

"there is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north, and twice that 
south. but you wouldn't get a safe path even then. there are no safe paths in this part of 
the world. remember you are over the edge of the wild now, and in for all sorts of fun 
wherever you go. before you could get round mirkwood in the north you would be right 
among the slopes of the grey mountains, and they are simply stiff with goblins, 
hobgoblins, and rest of the worst description. before you could get round it in the south, 
you would get into the land of the necromancer; and even you. bilbo, won't need me to 
tell you tales of that black sorcerer. i don't advise you to go anywhere near the places 
overlooked by his dark tower! stick to the forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for the 
best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you may come out one day and see the long

 the forest-
floor; but what made the noises he could not see. the nastiest things they saw were the 
cobwebs: dark dense cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick, often stretched from 
tree to tree, or tangled in the lower branches on either side of them. there were none 
stretched across the path, but whether because some magic kept it clear, or for what 
other reason they could not guess. 
it was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated the 
tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending. but they had 
to go on and on, long after they were sick for a sight of the sun and of the sky, and 
longed for the feel of wind on their faces. there was no movement of air down under the 
forest-roof, and it was everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. even the dwarves felt it, who 
were used to tunnelling, and lived at times for long whiles without the light of the sun; but 
the hobbit, who liked holes to make a house in but not to spend

there was a breath of air and a noise of wind, but it had a sad sound. a few leaves 
came rustling down to remind them that outside autumn was coming on. 
their feet ruffled among the dead leaves of countless other autumns that drifted over the 
banks of the path from the deep red carpets of the forest. 
still bombur slept and they grew very weary. at times they heard disquieting laughter. 
sometimes there was singing in the distance too. the laughter was the laughter of fair 
voices not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but it sounded eerie and strange, 
and they were not comforted, rather they hurried on from those parts with what strength 
they had left. 
two days later they found their path going downwards and before long they were in a 
valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks. 
"is there no end to this accursed forest?" said thorin. 
"somebody must climb a tree and see if he can get his head above the roof and have a 
look round. the only way is to choose

, if you must," he said. "i'm just going to lie here and sleep and dream of food, if i 
can't get it any other way. i hope i never wake up again." 
at that very moment balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: "what was that? i 
thought i saw a twinkle of light in the forest." 
they all looked, and a longish way off, it seemed, they saw a red twinkle in the dark; 
then another and another sprang out beside it. even bombur got up, and they hurried 
along then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. the light was in front of them and to the 
left of the path, and when at last they had drawn level with it, it seemed plain that torches 
and fires were burning under the trees, but a good way off their track. 
"it looks as if my dreams were coming true," gasped bombur puffing up behind. he 
wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. but the others remembered only 
too well the warnings of the wizard and of beorn. "a feast would be no good, if we never 
got back alive from it,

"but what brought you into the forest at all?" asked the king angrily. 
at that thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word. 
"very well!" said the king. "take him away and keep him safe, until he feels inclined to 
tell the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.'" 
then the elves put thongs on him, and shut him in one of the inmost caves with strong 
wooden doors, and left him. they gave him food and drink, plenty of both, if not very 
fine; for wood-elves were not goblins, and were reasonably well-behaved even to their 
worst enemies, when they captured them. 
the giant spiders were the only living things that they had no mercy upon. 
there in the king's dungeon poor thorin lay; and after he had got over his thankfulness 
for bread and meat and water, he began to wonder what had become of his unfortunate 
friends. it was not very long before he discovered; but that belongs to the next chapter 
and the beginning of another adventure in which the hobbit again show

and there across the sky. 
above the borders of the forest there was whistling, crying and piping. far over 
mirkwood tidings spread: "smaug is dead!" leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted. 
even before the elvenking rode forth the news had passed west right to the pinewoods 
of the misty mountains; beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at 
council in their caves. 
"that will be the last we shall hear of thorin oakenshield, i fear," said the king. "he 
would have done better to have remained my guest. it is an ill wind, all the same," he 
added, "that blows no one any good." for he too had not forgotten the legend of the 
wealth of thror. so it was that bard's messengers found him now marching with many 
spearmen and bowmen; and crows were gathered thick, above him, for they thought that 
war was awakening again, such as

een whirling forward; but it did not come with the wind, it came from the north, like a 
vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light could be seen between their wings. 

"halt!" cried gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted, 
between the advancing dwarves and the ranks awaiting them. "halt!" he called in a voice 
like thunder, and his staff blazed forth with a flash like the lightning. "dread has come 
upon you all! alas! it has come more swiftly than i guessed. the goblins are upon you! 
bolg of the north is coming. 
o dain! whose father you slew in moria. behold! the bats are above his army like a sea 
of locusts. they ride upon wolves and wargs are in their train!" 
amazement and confusion fell upon them all. even as gandalf had been speaking the 
darkness grew. the dwarves halted and gazed at the sky. the elves cried out with many 
voices. 
"come!" called gandalf. "there is yet time for council. let dain son of nain come swiftly 
to us!" 
so began a battle tha

t none had expected; and it was called the battle of five armies, 
and it was very terrible. upon one side were the goblins and the wild wolves, and upon 
the other were elves and men and dwarves. this is how it fell out. ever since the fall of 
the great goblin of the misty mountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had 
been rekindled to fury. messengers had passed to and fro between all their cities, 
colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to win the dominion of the north. 
tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and in all the mountains there was a forging 
and an arming. 
then they marched an

hastened night after night through the mountains, and came thus at last on a 
sudden from the north hard on the heels of dain. not even the ravens knew of their 
coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the lonely mountain from 
the hills behind. how much gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is plain that he had not 
expected this sudden assault. 
this is the plan that he made in council with the elvenking and with bard; and with dain, 
for the dwarf-lord now joined them: the goblins were the foes of all, and at their coming 
all other quarrels were forgotten. their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley 
between the arms of the mountain; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck 
south and east. yet this would be perilous, if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to 
overrun the mountain itself, and so attack them also from behind and above; but there 
was no time for make any other plan, or to summon any help. 
soon the thunder passed, rolling away to

g long afterwards, although he was quite unimportant in it. actually i must 
say he put on his ring early in the business, and vanished from sight, if not from all 
danger. a magic ring of that sort is not a complete protection in a goblin charge, nor 
does it stop flying arrows and wild spears; but it does help in getting out of the way, and 
it prevents your head from being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin 
swordsman. 
the elves were the first to charge. their hatred for the goblins is cold and bitter. their 
spears and swords shone in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so deadly was the 
wrath of the hands that held them. as soon as the host of their enemies was dense in 
the valley, they sent against it a shower of arrows, and each flickered as it fled as if with 
stinging fire. behind the arrows a thousand of their spearmen leapt down and charged. 
the yells were deafening. the rocks were stained black with goblin blood. just as the 
goblins were recovering from the

 onslaught and the elf-charge was halted, there rosen 
from across the valley a deep-throated roar. with cries of "moria!" and "dain, dain!" the 
dwarves of the iron hills plunged in, wielding their mattocks, upon the other side; and 
beside them came the men of the lake with long swords. 
panic came upon the goblins; and even as they turned to meet this new attack, the 
elves charged again with renewed numbers. already many of the goblins were flying 
back down the river to escape from the trap: and many of their own wolves were turning 
upon them and rending the dead and the wounded. victory seemed at hand, when a cry 
rang out on the heights above. 
goblins had scaled the mountain from the other side and already many were on the 
slopes above the gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless of those 
that fell screaming from cliff and precipice, to attack the spurs from above. each of these 
could be reached by pa

centre; and the defenders had too few to bar the way for long. victory now vanished 
from hope. they had only stemmed the first onslaught of the black tide. 
day drew on. the goblins gathered again in the valley. there a host of wargs came 
ravening and with them came the bodyguard of bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars 
of steel. soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while still the great bats 
swirled about the heads and ears of elves and men, or fastened vampire-like on the 
stricken. now bard was fighting to defend the eastern spur, and yet giving slowly back; 
and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the southern arm, near to the watch-
post on ravenhill. 
suddenly there was a great shout, and from the gate came a trumpet call. 
they had forgotten thorin

! part of the wall, moved by levers, fell outward with a crash 
into the pool. out leapt the king under the mountain, and his companions followed him. 
hood and cloak were gone; they were in shining armour, and red light leapt from their 
eyes. in the gloom the great dwarf gleamed like gold in a dying fire. 
rocks were buried down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on leapt down 
to the falls' foot, and rushed forward to battle. wolf and rider fell or fled before them. 
thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed to harm him. 
"to me! to me! elves and men! to me! o my kinsfolk!" he cried, and his voice shook 
like a horn in the valley. 
down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of dain to his help. down too came 
many of the lake-men, for bard could not restrain them; and out upon the other side 
came many of

the wargs were scattered and thorin drove right against the bodyguards of bolg. but 
he could not pierce their ranks. 
already behind him among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many 
a fair elf that should have lived yet long ages merrily in the wood. and as the valley 
widened his onset grew ever slower. his numbers were too few. 
his flanks were unguarded. soon th

e attackers were attacked, and they were forced into 
a great ring, facing every way, hemmed all about with goblins and wolves returning to 
the assault. the bodyguard of bolg came howling against them, and drove in upon their 
ranks like waves upon cliffs of sand. their friends could not help them, for the assault 
from the mountain was renewed with redoubled force, and upon either side men and 
elves were being slowly beaten down. 
on all this bilbo looked with misery. he had taken his stand on ravenhill among the 
elves-partly because there was more chance of escape from that point, and partly (with 
the

more tookish part of his mind) because if he was going to be in a last desperate 
stand, he preferred on the whole to defend the elvenking. gandalf, too, i may say, was 
there, sitting on the ground as if in deep thought, preparing, i suppose, some last blast of 
magic before the end. 
that did not seem far off. "it will not be long now," thought bilbo, "before the goblins win 
the gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. really it is enough to 
make one weep, after all one has gone through. i would rather old smaug had been left 
with all the wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old

the return journey 
 
when bilbo came to himself, he was literally by himself. he was lying on the flat stones 
of ravenhill, and no one was near. a cloudless day, but cold, was broad above him. he 
was shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head burned with fire. 
"now i wonder what has happened?" he said to himself. "at any rate i am not yet one of 
the fallen heroes; but i suppose there is still time enough for that!" 
he sat up painfully. looking into the valley he could see no living goblins. after a while 
as his head cleared a little, he thought he could see elves moving in the rocks below. he 
rubbed his eyes. surely there was a camp still in the plain some distance off; and there 

was a coming and going about the gate? dwarves seemed to be busy removing the 
wall. but all was deadly still. there was no call and no echo of a song. sorrow seemed 
to be in the air. "victory after all, i suppose!" he said, feeling his aching head. "well, 
it seems a very gloomy business." 
sudden

t mess of that business with the stone; and there was a 
battle, in spite of all your efforts to buy peace and quiet, but i suppose you can hardly be 
blamed for that." 

all that had happened after he was stunned, bilbo learned later; but it gave him more 
sorrow than joy, and he was now weary of his adventure. he was aching in his bones for 
the homeward journey. that, however, was a little delayed, so in the meantime i will tell 
something of events. the eagles had long had suspicion of the goblins' mustering; from 
their watchfulness the movements in the mountains could not be altogether hid. so they 
too had gathered in great numbers, under the great eagle of the misty mountains; and at 
length smelling battle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the nick of 
time. they it was who dislodged the goblins from the mountainslopes, casting them over 
precipices, or driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. it was not 
long before they had freed the lonely moun

tain, and elves and men on either side of the 
valley could come at last to the help of the battle below. 
but even with the eagles they were still outnumbered. 
in that last hour beorn himself had appeared - no one knew how or from where. he 
came alone, and in bear's shape; and he seemed to have grown almost to giant-size in 
his wrath. the roar of his voice was like drums and guns; and he tossed wolves and 
goblins from his path like straws and feathers. he fell upon their rear, and broke like a 
clap of thunder through the ring. the dwarves were making a stand still about their lords 
upon a low rounded hill. 
then beorn stooped and lifted thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him 
out of the fray. swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing could 
withstand him, and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. he scattered the bodyguard, 
and pulled down bolg himself and crushe

d him. then dismay fell on the goblins and 
they fled in all directions. but weariness left their enemies with the coming of new hope, 
and they pursued them closely, and prevented most of them from escaping where they 
could. they drove many of them into the running river, and such as fled south or west 
they hunted into the marshes about the forest river; and there the greater part of the 
last fugitives perished, while those that came hardly to the wood-elves' realm were there 
slain, or drawn in to die in the trackless dark of m

bye and good luck, wherever you fare!" said balin at last. "if ever you visit us again, 
when our halls are made fair once more, then the feast shall indeed be splendid!" 
"if ever you are passing my way," said bilbo, "don't wait to knock! tea is at four; but any 
of you are welcome at any time!" 
then he turned away. 
the elf-host was on the march;. and if it was sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for 
now the northern world would be merrier for many a long day. 
the dragon was dead, and the goblins overthrown, and their hearts looked forward after 
winter to a spring of joy. gandalf and bilbo rode behind the elvenking, and beside them 
strode beorn, once again in man's shape, and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon 
the road. so they went on until they drew near to the borders of mirkwood, to the north of 
the place where the forest river ran out. 
then they halted, for the wizard and bilbo would not enter the wood, even though the 
king bade them stay a while in his halls. they inte

nded to go along the edge of the 
forest, and round its northern end in the waste that lay between it and the beginning of 
the grey mountains. it was a long and cheerless road, but now that the goblins were 
crushed, it seemed safer to them than the dreadful pathways under the trees. moreover 
beorn was going that way too. 
"farewell! o elvenking!" said gandalf. "merry be the greenwood, while the world is yet 
young! and merry be all your folk!" 
"farewell! o gandalf!" said the king. "may you ever appear where you are most needed 
and least expected! the oftener you appear in my halls the better shall i be pleased!" 

"i beg of you," said bilbo stammering and standing on one foot, "to accept

"i will take your gift, o bilbo the magnificent!" said the king gravely. 
"and i name you elf-friend and blessed. may your shadow never grow less (or stealing 
would be too easy)! farewell!" 
then the elves turned towards the forest, and bilbo started on his long road home. 
he had many hardships and adventures before he got back. the wild was still the wild, 
and there were many other things in it in those days besides goblins; but he was well 
guided and well guarded-the wizard was with him, and beorn for much of the way-and 
he was never in great danger again. anyway by mid-winter gandalf and bilbo had come 
all the way back, along both edges of the forest, to the doors of beorn's house; and 
there for a while they both stayed. yule-tide was warm and merry there; and men came 
from far and wide to feast at beorn's bidding. the goblins of the misty mountains were 
now few and terrified, and hidden in the deepest hol
