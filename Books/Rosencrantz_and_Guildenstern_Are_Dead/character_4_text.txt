wrist and holds her hard, then he goes to the length of his arm and with his other hand over his brow, falls to such

 ros: believe what?
 hamlet: that i can keep your counsel and not mine own. besides, to be demanded of a sponge, what
replication should be made by the son of a king?
 ros: take you me for a sponge, my lord?
 hamlet: ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. but such officers do the king
best service in the end. he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed, to be last
swallowed. when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry again.

the exit, hamlet, apparently seeing claudius approaching from off stage, bends low in a sweeping bow. ros
and guil, cued by hamlet, also bow deeply-a sweeping ceremonial bow with their cloaks swept round them.
hamlet, however, continues the movement into an about-turn and walks off in the opposite direction. ros and
guil, with their heads low, do not notice. no one comes on. ros and guil squint upwards and
find that they are bowing to nothing.
 claudius enters behind them. at his first words they leap up and do a double-take.)

 (again there is a fractional moment in which ros is smug, cuil is trapped and betrayed. guil opens his
mouth and closes it.)

go out, following claudius.)

 (guil meanwhile has been resuming his own theme - looking out over the audience - )
 free to move, speak, extemporise, and yet. we have not been cut loose. our truancy is defined by one fixed
star, and our drift represents merely a slight chance of angle to it: we may seize the moment, toss it around while
the moment pass, a short dash here, an exploration there, but we are brought round full circle to face again the
single immutable fact - that we, rosencrantz and guildenstern, are taking hamlet to england.
 (by which time, ros has returned, tiptoeing with great import, teeth clenched for secrecy, get to guil, points
surreptitiously behind him - and a tight whisper:)
 ros: i say - he's here!
 guil (unsurprised): what's he doing?
 ros: sleeping.
 guil: it's all right for him.
 ros: what is?
 guil: he can sleep.
 ros: it's all right for him.
 guil: he's got us now.
 ros: he can sleep.
 guil: it's all done for him.
 ros: he's got us.
 guil: and we've got nothing. (a cry.) all i ask is our

 anything-you just repeat it in a different order.
 ros: i can't think of anything original. i'm only good in support.
 guil: i'm sick of making the running.
 ros (humbly): it must be your dominant personality. (almost in tears.) oh, what's going to become of us!
 (and guil comforts him, all harshness gone.)
 guil: don't cry... it's all right... there... there, i'll see we're all right.
 ros: but we've got nothing to go on, we're out on our own.
 guil: we're on our way to england - we're taking hamlet there.
 ros: what for?
 guil: what for? where have you been?
 ros: when? (pause.) we won't know what to do when we get there.
 guil: we take him to the king.
 ros: will he be there?
 guil: no - the king of england.
 ros: he's expecting us?
 guil: no.
 ros: he won't know what we're playing at. what are we going to say?
 guil: we've got a letter. you remember the letter.
 ros: do i?
 guil: everything is explained in the letter. we count on that.
 ros: is that it, then?
 guil: what?
 ros: we take

hamlet to the english king, we hand over the letter â€“ what then?
 guil: there may be something in the letter to keep us going a bit.
 ros: and if not?
 guil: then that's it-we're finished.
 ros: at a loose end?
 guil: yes.
 (pause.)
 ros: are there likely to be loose ends? (pause.) who is the english king?
 guil: that depends on when we get there.
 ros: what do you think it says?
 guil: oh... greetings. expressions of loyalty. asking of favours, calling in of debts. obscure promises
balanced by vagu

e threats.... diplomacy. regards to the family.
 ros: and about hamlet?
 guil: oh yes.
 ros: and us-the full background?
 guil: i should say so.
 (pause.)
 ros: so we've got a letter which explains everything.
 guil: you've got it.
 (ros takes that literally. he starts to pat his pockets, etc.)
 what's the matter?
 ros: the letter.
 guil: have you got it?
 ros (rising fear): have i? (searches frantically.) where would i have put it?
 guil: you can't have lost it.
 ros: i must have!
 guil: that's odd-i thought he gave it to me.
 (ros looks at him hopefully.)
 ros:

ious): he won't know what we're talking about - what are we going to say?
 guil: we say - your majesty, we have arrived.
 ros (kingly): and who are you?
 guil: we are rosencrantz and guildenstern.
 ros (barks): never heard of you!
 guil: well, we're nobody special -
 ros (regal and nasty): what's your game?
 guil: we've got our instructions -
 ros: first i've heard of it -
 guil (angrily): let me finish - (humble.) we've come from denmark,
 ros: what do you want?
 guil: nothing-we're delivering hamlet -
 ros: who's he?
 guil (irritated): you've heard of him--
 ros: oh, i've heard of him all right and i want nothing to do with it.
 guil: but -
 ros: you march in here without so much as a by your leave and expect me to take every lunatic you try to pass
off with a lot of unsubstantiated -
 guil: we've got a letter -
 (ros snatches it and tears it open.)
 ros (efficiently): i see... i see... well, this seems to support your story such as it is - it is an exact command
from the king of denmark,

 (guil snatches the letter. ros, doubletaking, snatches it back, guil snatches it halfback. they read it
together, and separate.)
 (pause.)
 (they are well downstage looking front.)
 ros: the sun's going down. it will be dark soon.
 guil: do you think so?
 ros: i was just making conversation. (pause.) we're his friends.
 guil: how do you know?
 ros: from our young days brought up with him.
 guil: you've only got their word for it.
 ros: but that's what we depend on.
 guil: wel

e presumptuous of us to interfere with the designs of fate or even of kings. all in all, i think we'd be well
advised to leave well alone. tie up the letter - there - neatly - like that - they won't notice the broken seal,
assuming you were in character.
 ros: but what's the point?
 guil: don't apply logic.
 ros: he's done nothing to us.
 guil: or justice.
 ros: it's awful.
 guil: but it could have been worse. i was beginning to think it was. (and his relief comes out in a laugh.)
 (behind them hamlet appears from behind the umbrella. the light has been going. slightly. hamlet is going
to the lantern.)
 ros: the position as i see it, then. we, rosencrantz and guildenstern, from our young days brought up with
him, awakened by a man standing on his saddle, are summoned, and arrive, and are instructed to glean what
afflicts him and draw him on to pleasures, such as a play, which unfortunately, as it turns out, is abandoned in some
confusion owing to certain nuances outside our appreciation - wh

(hamlet blows out the lantern. the stage goes pitch black.)
 (the black resolves itself to moonlight, by which hamlet approaches the sleeping ros and guil. he
extracts the letter and takes it behind his umbrella; the tight of his lantern shines through the fabric, hamlet
emerges again with a letter, and replaces it, and retires, blowing out his lantern.)
 (morning comes.)
 (ros watches it coming-from the auditorium. behind him is a gay sight. beneath the re-tilted umbrella, reclining
in a deckchair, wrapped in a rug, reading a book, possibly smoking, sits hamlet.)
 (ros watches the morning come, and brighten to high noon.)
 ros: i'm assuming nothing. (he stands up. guil wakes.) the position as i see it, then. that's west unless
we're off course, in which case i

t's night; the king gave me the same as you, the king gave you the same as me:
the king never gave me the letter, the king gave you the letter, we don't know what's in the letter; we take hamlet
to the english king, it depending on when we get there who he is, and we hand over the letter, which may or
may not have something in it to keep us going, and if not, we are finished and at a loose end, if they have loose
ends. we could have done worse. i don't think we missed any chance... not that we're getting much help. (he
sits down again. they lie down - prone.) if we stopped breathing we'd vanish.

so far.
 guil: and you?
 player: in disfavour. our play offended the king.
 guil: yes.
 player: well, he's a second husband himself. tactless, really.
 ros: it was quite a good play nevertheless.
 player: we never really got going-it was getting quite interesting when they stopped it.
 (looks up at hamlet.)
 that's the way to travel...
 guil: what were you doing in there?
 player: hiding. (indicating costumes.) we had to run for it just as we were.
 ros: stowaways.
 player: naturally-we didn't get paid, owing to circumstances ever so slightly beyond our control, and all the
money we had we lost betting on certainties. life is a gamble, at terrible odds-if it was a bet you wouldn't
take it. did you know that any number doubled is even?
 ros: is it?
 player: we learn something every day, to our co

il: pointless.
 ros: it's allowed.
 guil: allowed, yes. we are not restricted. no boundaries have been defined, no inhibitions imposed. we
have, for the while, secured, or blundered into, our release, for the while. spontaneity and whim are the
order of the day. other wheels are turning but they are not our concern. we can breathe. we can relax. we can do
what we like and say what we like to whomever we like, without restriction.
 ros: within limits, of course.
 guil: certainly within limits.
 (hamlet comes down to footlights and regards the audience. the others watch but don't speak. hamlet
clears his throat noisily and spits into the audience. a split second later he claps his hand to his eye and wipes
himself. he goes back upstage.)
 ros: a compulsion towards philosophical introspection is his chief characteristic, if i may put it like that. it
does not mean he is mad. it does mean he isn't. very often, it does not mean anything at all. which may
or may not be a kind of madness.
 guil: it

 guil: and talking to himself.
 (ros and guil move apart together.)
 well, where has that got us?
 ros: he's the player.
 guil: his play offended the king-
 ros: -offended the king-
 guil: -who orders his arrest-
 ros: -orders his arrest-
 guil: -so he escapes to england-
 ros: on the boat to which he meets-
 guil: guildenstern and rosencrantz taking hamlet-
 ros: -who also offended the king-
 guil: -and killed polonius-
 ros: -offended the king in a variety of ways-
 guil: -to england. (pause.) that seems to be it.
 (ros jumps up.)
 ros: incidents! all we get is incidents! dear god, is it too much to expect a little sustained action?!
 (and on the word, the pirates attack. that is to say:
 noise and shouts and rushing about. "pirates".)
 (everyone visible goes frantic. hamlet draws his sword and rushes downstage. guil, ros and player
draw swords

and rush upstage, collision.
hamlet turns his back up. they turn back down. collision. by which time there is general panic right upstage.
all four charge upstage with ros, guil and player shouting:
 at last!
 to arms!
 pirates!
 up there!
 down there!
 to my sword's length!
 action!
 (all four reach the top, see something they don't like, waver, run for their lives downstage:)
 (hamlet, in the lead, leaps into the left barrel. player leaps into the right barrel. ros and guil leap into the
middle barrel. all closing the lids after them.)
 (the lights dim to nothing while the sound of fighting continues. the sound fades to nothing. the lights come
up.)
 (the middle barrel (ros's and guil's) is missing.)
 (the lid of the right-hand barrel is raised cautiously, the heads of ros and guil appear.)
 (the lid of the other barrel (hamlet's) is raised. the head of the player appears.)

 guil: but you don't understand - it contains - we've had our instructions - the whole thing's pointless

 player: pirates could happen to anyone. just deliver the letter. they'll send ambassadors from england to

 player: there... !
 guil: we need hamlet for our release!

dead tragedians, the tableau of court and corpses which is the last scene of "hamlet".)

there.)
