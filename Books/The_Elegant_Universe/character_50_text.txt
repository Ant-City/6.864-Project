predictions or postdictions (beyond witten's remark regarding the postdiction of gravity).

why can't we figure out which is the "right" calabi-yau shape? most string theorists blame this
on the inadequacy of the theoretical tools currently being used to analyze string theory. as we shall
discuss in some detail in chapter 12, the mathematical framework of string theory is so complicated
that physicists have been able to perform only approximate calculations through a formalism known
as perturbation theory. in this approximation scheme, each possible calabi-yau shape appears to be
on equal footing with every other; none is fundamentally singled out by the equations. and since the
physical  consequences  of  string  theory  depend  sensitively  on  the  precise  form  of  the  curled-up
dimensions,  without  the  ability  to  select  one  calabi-yau  space  from  the  many,  no  definitive
experimentally testable conclusions can be drawn. a driving force behind present-day research is to

 to the initial estimate.

when  perturbation  theory  is  properly  and  effectively  applied,  the  initial  estimate  will  be
reasonably close to the final answer; when incorporated, the fine details ignored in the initial estimate
make  small  differences  in  the  final  result.  but  sometimes  when  you  go  to  pay  a  final  bill  it  is
shockingly  different  from  the  initial  estimate. although  you  might  use  other,  more  emotive  terms,
technically this is called a failure of perturbation theory. this means that the initial approximation
was not a good guide to the final answer because the "refinements," rather than causing relatively
small deviations, resulted in large changes to the ballpark estimate.

as indicated briefly in earlier chapters, our discussion of string theory to this point has relied on
a  perturbative  approach  somewhat  analogous  to  that  used  by  the  mechanic.  the  "incomplete
understanding" of string theory that we have referred to from time to time has its

roots, in one way or
another, in this approximation method. let's build up to an understanding of this important remark by
discussing perturbation theory in a context that is less abstract than string theory but closer to its string

theory application than the example of the mechanic.

a classical example of perturbation theory

understanding the motion of the earth through the solar system provides a classic example of using a
perturbative approach. on such large distance scales, we need consider only the gravitational force,
but  unless  further  approximations  are  made,  the  equations  encountered  are  extremely  complicated.
remember that according to both newton and einstein, everything exerts a gravitational influence on
everything else, and this quickly leads to a complex and mathematically intractable grav

eir  values  transcend  the
perturbative  approximation  scheme.  for  this  reason,  you  can  also  think  of  bps  as  standing  for
"beyond perturbative states."

the bps properties exhaust only a small part of the full physics of a chosen string theory when
its  coupling  constant  is  large,  but  they  nonetheless  give  us  a  tangible  grip  on  some  of  its  strong
coupling characteristics. as the coupling constant in a chosen string theory is increased beyond the
realm accessible to perturbation theory, we anchor our limited understanding in the bps states. like a
few choice words in a foreign tongue, we will find that they will take us quite far.

duality in string theory

following witten, let's start with one of the five string theories, say the type i string, and imagine that
all of its nine space dimensions are flat and unfurled. this, of course, is not at all realistic, but it
makes the discussion simpler; we will return to curled-up dimensions shortly. we begin by assuming
that the str

 one  we  started  with.  similar  to  what  we  found  in  trying  to  squeeze  a
circular dimension to a sub-planck-scale length, if we try to increase the type iib coupling to a value
larger than 1, the self-duality shows that the resulting theory is precisely equivalent to the type iib
string with a coupling smaller than 1.

a summary, so far

let's  see  where  we  are.  by  the  mid-1980s,  physicists  had  constructed  five  different  superstring
theories. in the approximation scheme of perturbation theory, they all appear to be distinct. but this
approximation method is valid only if the string coupling constant in a given string theory is less than
1. the expectation has been that physicists should be able to calculate the precise value of the string
coupling  constant  in  any  given  string  theory,  but  the  form  of  the  approximate  equations  currently
available  makes  this  impossible.  for  this  reason,  physicists  aim  to  study  each  of  the  five  string
theories  for  a  range
