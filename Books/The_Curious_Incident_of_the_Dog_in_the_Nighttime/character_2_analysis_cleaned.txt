[CHARACTER]([CHARACTER])
for the majority of the novel, our only view of [CHARACTER]comes
                through christopher's memories. he remembers her as loving but impatient, and prone
                to breakdowns in the face of his tantrums. she also comes across as a dreamer who is
                unable to cope with the harsh realities of christopher's condition. but she receives
                a momentary turn as the narrator--the only instance in the novel when see a
                first-person point of view other than christopher's--when christopher includes in his
                book a series of her letters in full. in these letters, she exhibits the patience
                that she lacked in her face-to-face interactions with him, writing forty-three
                letters over the course of two years, despite getting no response. although she
                tells christopher in the letters that she left him and his father because she
                thought they would be happier without her, this explanation is clearly only part of
                her reasoning. we also see in the letters the intense frustration she felt with
                christopher and her inability to deal with his behavior, as when christopher threw a
                tantrum in a department store while he and his mother were christmas shopping. she
                felt unable to cope with these fits of christopher's, possibly because of her
                depression, which christopher mentions at one point in passing. when we finally meet
                her in person, however, [CHARACTER]turns out to be strong-willed and
                independent. even so, she evidently still finds dealing with christopher extremely
                difficult because of his rigid needs and sometimes inappropriate behavior. she
                clearly loves christopher but also has doubts about her ability to take care of
                him.
