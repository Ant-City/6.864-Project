_the background represents the front of the castle of_ pentheus, _king

    little enclosure overgrown with wild vines, with a cleft in the
    rocky floor of it from which there issues at times steam or smoke.

i walk again by dirce's streams and scan
ismenus' shore. there by the castle side
i see her place, the tomb of the lightning's bride,
the wreck of smouldering chambers, and the great
faint wreaths of fire undying--as the hate
dies not, that hera held for semelê.

and now i come to hellas--having taught
all the world else my dances and my rite
of mysteries, to show me in men's sight
manifest god.
                and first of hellene lands
i cry thus thebes to waken; set her hands
to clasp my wand, mine ivied javelin,
and round her shoulders hang my wild fawn-skin.
for they have scorned me whom it least beseemed,
semelê's sisters; mocked my birth, nor deemed
that dionysus sprang from dian seed.
my mother sinned, said they; and in her need,
with cadmus plotting, cloaked her human shame
with the dread name of zeus; for that the flame
from heaven consumed her, seeing she lied to god.
  thus must they vaunt; and therefore hath my rod
on them first fallen, and stung them forth wild-eyed
from empty chambers; the bare mountain side
is made their home, and all their hearts are flame.

sions both to the myth and to the
religion of dionysus.

1. the myth, as implied by euripides. semelê, daughter of cadmus, being
loved by zeus, asked her divine lover to appear to her once in his full
glory; he came, a blaze of miraculous lightning, in the ecstasy of which
semelê died, giving premature birth to a son. zeus, to save this child's
life and make him truly god as well as man, tore open his own flesh and
therein fostered the child till in due time, by a miraculous and
mysterious second birth, the child of semelê came to full l

2. the religion of dionysus is hard to formulate or even describe, both
because of its composite origins and because of its condition of
constant vitality, fluctuation, and development.

(_a_) the first datum, apparently, is the introduction from thrace of
the characteristic god of the wild northern mountains, a god of
intoxication, of inspiration, a giver of superhuman or immortal life.
his worship is superposed upon that of divers old tree or vegetation
gods, already worshipped in greece. he becomes specially th

vine. originally a god of the common folk, despised and unauthorised, he
is eventually so strong as to be adopted into the olympian hierarchy as
the "youngest" of the gods, son of zeus. his "olympian" name, so to
speak, is dionysus, but in his worship he is addressed by numbers of
names, more or less mystic and secret--bromios, bacchios or baccheus,
iacchos, eleuthercus, zagreus, sabazios, &c. some of these may be the
names of old spirits whom he has displaced; some are his own thracian
names. bromos and sabaja, for instance, seem to have been thracian names
for two kinds of intoxicating drink. bacchos means a "wand." together
with his many names, he has many shapes, especially appearing as a bull
and a serpent.

 the common people, was seized upon and
transfigured by the great wave of religious reform, known under the name
of orphism, which swept over greece and south italy in the sixth century
b.c., and influenced the teachings of such philosophers as pythagoras,
aristeas, empedocles, and the many writers on purification and the world
after death. orphism may very possibly represent an ancient cretan
religion in clash or fusion with one from thrace. at any rate, it was
grafted straight upon the dionysus-worship, and, without rationalising,
spiritualised and reformed it. ascetic, mystical, ritualistic, and
emotional, orphism easily excited both enthusiasm and ridicule. it lent
itself both to inspired saintliness and to imposture. in doctrine it
laid especial stress upon sin, and the sacerdotal purification of sin;
on the eternal reward due beyond the grave to the pure and the impure,
the pure living in an eternal ecstasy--"perpetual intoxication," as
plato satirically calls it--the impur

e toiling through long ages to wash
out their stains. it recast in various ways the myth of dionysus, and
especially the story of his second birth. all true worshippers become in
a mystical sense one with the god; they are born again and are
"bacchoi." dionysus being the god within, the perfectly pure soul is
possessed by the god wholly, and becomes nothing but the god.

based on very primitive rites and feelings, on the religion of men who
made their gods in the image of snakes and bulls and fawns, because they
hardly felt any difference of kind between themselves and the animals,
the worship of dionysus kept always this feeling of kinship with wild
things. the beautiful side of this feeling is vividly conspicuous in
_the bacchae_. and the ho

rrible side is not in the least concealed.

a curious relic of primitive superstition and cruelty remained firmly
imbedded in orphism--a doctrine irrational and unintelligible, and for
that very reason wrapped in the deepest and most sacred mystery: a
belief in the sacrifice of dionysus himself, and the purification of man
by his blood.

it seems possible that the savage thracians, in the fury of their
worship on the mountains, when they were possessed by the god and became
"wild beasts," actually tore with their teeth and hands any hares,
goats, fawns, or the like that they came across. there survives a
constant tradition of inspired bacchanals in their miraculous strength
tearing even bulls asunder--a feat, happily, beyond the bounds of human
possibility. the wild b

east that tore was, of course, the savage god
himself. and by one of those curious confusions of thought, which seem
so inconceivable to us and so absolutely natural and obvious to
primitive men, the beast torn was also the god! the orphic congregations
of later times, in their most holy gatherings, solemnly partook of the
blood of a bull, which was, by a mystery, the blood of dionysus-zagreus
himself, the "bull of god," slain in sacrifice for the purification of
man. and the maenads of poetry and myth, among more beautiful proofs of
their superhuman or infra-human character, have always to tear bulls in
pieces and taste of the blood. it is noteworthy, and throws much light
on the spirit of orphism, that apart from this sacramental tasting of
the blood, the orphic worshipper held it an abomination to eat the flesh
of animals at all. the same religious fervour and zeal

uncanny; because it was a mystery which transcended
reason!

it will be observed that euripides, though certainly familiar with
orphism--which he mentions in _the hippolytus_ and treated at length in
_the cretans_ (see appendix)--has in _the bacchae_ gone back behind
orphism to the more primitive stuff from which it was made. he has
little reference to any specially orphic doctrine; not a word, for
instance, about the immortality of the soul. and his idealisation or
spiritualisation of dionysus-worship proceeds along the lines of his
own thought, not on those already fixed by the orphic teachers.

gives the two births of dionysus, from semelê and from the body of zeus,
mentioning his mystic epiphanies as bull and as serpent. the next
strophe is an appeal to thebes, the birthplace or "nurse" of the god's
mother, semelê; the antistrophe, an appeal to the cavern in crete, the
birthplace of zeus, the god's father, and the original home of the
mystic timbrel. the epode, or closing song, is full, not of doctrine,

pp. 120-124, ll. 810 ff.--this scene of the 'hypnotising'--if one may
use the word--of pentheus probably depends much on the action, which,
however, i have not ventured to prescribe. pentheus seems to struggle
against the process all through, to be amazed at himself for consenting,
while constantly finding fresh reasons for doing so.

p. 121, l. 822, am i a woman, then?]--the robe and coif were, in the
original legend, marks of the thracian dress worn by the thracian
followers of dionysus, and notably by orpheus. the tradition became
fixed that pentheus wore such a robe and coif; and to the greeks of
euripides' time such a dress seemed to be a woman's. hence this turn of
the story (cf. above, p. 167).

p. 125, ll. 877-881.--the refrain of this chorus about the fawn is
difficult to interpret. i have practically interpolated the third line

show the connection of ideas; (2) to make clearer the meaning (as

of unselfish feeling, of pity and humanity, becomes increasingly marked
in all the victims of dionysus towards the end of the play, and
contrasts the more vividly with the god's pitilessness. cadmus is always
gentle, and always thinking of the sufferings of others; and, indeed, so
is agâvê, after her return to reason, though with more resentment
against the oppressor.
