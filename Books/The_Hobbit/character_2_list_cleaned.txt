[CHARACTER]  - 
a dwarf who leads his fellow dwarves on a trip to
the lonely mountain to reclaim their treasure from smaug. smaug's
bounty is thorin's inheritance, as it belonged to thror, thorin's
grandfather, the great king under the mountain. thorin is a proud, purposeful,
and sturdy warrior, if a bit stubborn at times. as the novel progresses,
his inability to formulate successful plans, his greed, and his
reliance on bilbo to save him at every turn make thorin a somewhat
unappealing figure, but he is partly redeemed by the remorse he
shows before he dies.
