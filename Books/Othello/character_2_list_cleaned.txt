[CHARACTER]	 - 
                othello's
ensign (a job also known as an ancient or standard-bearer), and
the villain of the play. [CHARACTER] is twenty-eight years old. while his
ostensible reason for desiring othello's demise is that he has been
passed over for promotion to lieutenant, [CHARACTER]'s motivations are
never very clearly expressed and seem to originate in an obsessive,
almost aesthetic delight in manipulation and destruction.
