          out,]

          enter mathias.

     mathias. who's this? fair abigail, the rich jew's daughter,
     become a nun! her father's sudden fall
     has humbled her, and brought her down to this:
     tut, she were fitter for a tale of love,
     than to be tired out with orisons;
     and better would she far become a bed,
     embraced in a friendly lover's arms,
     than rise at midnight to a solemn mass.

          enter lodowick.

     lodowick. why, how now, don mathias! in a dump?

     mathias. believe me, noble lodowick, i have seen
     the strangest sight, in my opinion,
     that ever i beheld.

     lodowick. what was't, i prithee?

     mathias. a fair young maid, scarce fourteen years of age,
     the sweetest flower in cytherea's field,
     cropt from the pleasures of the fruitful earth,
     and strangely metamorphos'd [to a] nun.

     lodowick. but say, what was she?

     mathias. why, the rich jew's daughter.

     lodowick. what, barabas, whos

   and duck as low as any bare-foot friar;
     hoping to see them starve upon a stall,
     or else be gather'd for in our synagogue,
     that, when the offering-basin comes to me,
     even for charity i may spit into't.--
     here comes don lodowick, the governor's son,
     one that i love for his good father's sake.

          enter lodowick.

     lodowick. i hear the wealthy jew walked this way:
     i'll seek him out, and so insinuate,
     that i may have a sight of abigail,
     for don mathias tells me she is fair.

     barabas. now will i shew myself to have more of the serpent than
     the dove; that is, more knave than fool.
          [aside.]

     lodowick. yond' walks the jew:  now for fair abigail.

     barabas. ay, ay, no doubt but she's at your command.
          [aside.]

     lodowick. barabas, thou know'st i am the governor's son.

     barabas.
     i would you were his father too, sir! that's all the harm
     i wish you.--the slave looks like a hog's cheek new-singe

     my lord, farewell.--come, sirrah; you are mine.--
     as for the diamond, it shall be yours:
     i pray, sir, be no stranger at my house;
     all that i have shall be at your command.

          enter mathias and katharine. [75]

     mathias. what make the jew and lodowick so private?
     i fear me 'tis about fair abigail.
          [aside.]

     barabas. [to lodowick.] yonder comes don mathias; let us stay: [76]
     he loves my daughter, and she holds him dear;
     but i have sworn to frustrate both their hopes,
     and be reveng'd upon the--governor.

     katharine. this moor is comeliest, is he not? speak, son.

     mathias. no, this is the better, mother, view this well.

     lest she mistrust the match that is in hand:

     abigail, bid him welcome for my sake.

     abigail. for your sake and his own he's welcome hither.

     barabas. daughter, a word more:  kiss him, speak him fair,
     and like a cunning jew so cast about,
     that ye be both made sure [84] ere you come out.

     abigail. o father, don mathias is my love!

     barabas. i know it:  yet, i say, make love to him;
     do, it is requisite it should be so.--
          [aside to her.]
     nay, on my life, it is my factor's hand;
     but go you in, i'll think upon the account.
          [exeunt abigail and lodowick into the house.]
     the account is made, for lodovico [85] dies.
     my factor sends me word a merchant's fled

     for now by this has he kiss'd abigail,
     and she vows love to him, and he to her.
     as sure as heaven rain'd manna for the jews,
     so sure shall he and don mathias die:
     his father was my chiefest enemy.

          enter mathias.

     whither goes don mathias? stay a while.

     mathias. whither, but to my fair love abigail?

     barabas. thou know'st, and heaven can witness it is true,
     that i intend my daughter shall be thine.

     mathias. ay, barabas, or else thou wrong'st me much.

     barabas. o, heaven forbid i should have such a thought!
     pardon me though i weep:  the governor's son
     will, whether i will or no, have abigail;
     he sends her letters, bracelets, jewels, rings.

     mathias. does she receive them?

 mathias, as thou lov'st me, not a word.

     mathias. well, let it pass; another time shall serve.
          [exit into the house.]

     lodowick. barabas, is not that the widow's son?

     barabas. ay, and take heed, for he hath sworn your death.

     lodowick. my death! what, is the base-born peasant mad?

     barabas. no, no; but happily [86] he stands in fear
     of that which you, i think, ne'er dream upon,--
     my daughter here, a paltry silly girl.

     lodowick. why, loves she don mathias?

     barabas. doth she not with her smiling answer you?

     abigail. he has my heart; i smile against my will.
          [aside.]

     lodowick. barabas, thou know'st i have lov'd thy daughter long.

     barabas. and so has she done you, even from a child.

     lodowick. and now i can no longer hold my mind.

     barabas. nor i the affection that i bear to you.

     lodowick. this is thy diamond; tell me, shall i have it?

     this offspring of cain, this jebusite,
     that never tasted of the passover,
     nor e'er shall see the land of canaan,
     nor our messias that is yet to come;

     abigail. what, shall i be betroth'd to lodowick?

     barabas. it's no sin to deceive a christian;
     for they themselves hold it a principle,
     faith is not to be held with heretics:
     but all are heretics that are not jews;
     this follows well, and therefore, daughter, fear not.--
          [aside to her.]
     i have entreated her, and she will grant.

     abigail. i cannot take my leave of him for tears.
     father, why have you thus incens'd them both?

     barabas. what's that to thee?

     abigail. i'll make 'em friends again.

     barabas.
     you'll make 'em friends! are there not jews enow in malta,
     but thou must dote upon a christian?

     abigail. i will have don mathias; he is my love.

     barabas. yes, you shall have him.--go, put her in.

     you purchase both their lives:  is it not so?

     barabas. true; and it shall be cunningly perform'd.

     ithamore. i will, forsooth, mistress.
          [exit.]

     abigail. hard-hearted father, unkind barabas!
     was this the pursuit of thy policy,
     to make me shew them favour severally,
     that by my favour they should both be slain?
     admit thou lov'dst not lodowick for his sire, [103]
     yet don mathias ne'er offended thee:
     but thou wert set upon extreme revenge,
     because the prior dispossess'd thee once,
     and couldst not venge it but upon his son;
     nor on his son but by mathias' means;
     nor on mathias but by murdering me:
     but i perceive there is no love on earth,
     pity in jews, nor piety in turks.--
     but here comes cursed ithamore with the friar.

     barabas. what, abigail become a nun again!
     false and unkind! what, hast thou lost thy father?
     and, all unknown and unconstrain'd of me,
     art thou again got to the nunnery?
     now here she writes, and wills me to repent:
     repentance! spurca! what pretendeth [106] this?
     i fear she knows--'tis so--of my device
     in don mathias' and lodovico's deaths:
     if so, 'tis time that it be seen into;
     for she that varies from me in belief,
     gives great presumption that she loves me not,
     or, loving, doth dislike of something done.--
     but who comes here?

                         o ithamore, come near;

     my trusty servant, nay, my second self; [107]
