Beaufort - 
      Beaufort is the head of the English church. Known in 1 Henry VI as Winchester, he and Gloucester have a long-standing dislike for each other.

When it is revealed that Gloucester was murdered, Beaufort falls ill and dies miserably, signifying the fact that he had sins on his conscience.
