the grandmother didn't want to go to florida. she wanted to visit some of her connections in east tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change bailey's mind. bailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. he was sitting on the edge of his chair at the table, bent over the orange sports section of the journal. "now look here, bailey," she said, "see here, read this," and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the newspaper at his bald head. "here this fellow that calls himself the misfit is aloose from the federal pen and headed toward florida and you read here what it says he did to these people. just you read it. i wouldn't take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in it. i couldn't answer to my conscience if i did."

bailey didn't look up from his reading so she wheeled a

the next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. she had her big black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it she was hiding a basket with pitty sing, the cat, in it. she didn't intend for the cat to be left alone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he might brush against one of the gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. her son, bailey, didn't like to arrive at a motel with a cat.

she sat in the middle of the back seat with john wesley and june star on either side of her. bailey and the children's mother and the baby sat in front and they left atlanta at eight forty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. the grandmother wrote this down because she thought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. it took them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.

she said she thought it was going to be a good day for driving, neither too hot nor too cold, and she cautioned bailey that the speed limit was fifty-five miles an hour and that the patrolmen hid themselves behind billboards and small clumps of trees and sped out after you before you had a chance to slow down. she pointed out interesting details of the scenery: stone mountain; the blue granite that in some places came up to both sides of the highway; the brilliant red clay banks slightly streaked with purple; and the various crops

inside, the tower was a long dark room with a counter at one end and tables at the other and dancing space in the middle. they all sat down at a board table next to the nickelodeon and red sam's wife, a tall burnt-brown woman with hair and eyes lighter than her skin, came and took their order. the children's mother put a dime in the machine and played "the tennessee waltz," and the grandmother said that tune always made her want to dance. she asked bailey if he would like to dance but he only glared at her. he didn't have a naturally sunny disposition like she did and trips made him nervous. the grandmother's brown eyes were very bright. she swayed her head from side to side and pretended she was dancing in her chair. june star said play something she could tap to so the children's mother put in another dime and played a fast number and june star stepped out onto the dance floor and did her tap routine.

her own snoring. outside of toombsboro she woke up and recalled an old plantation that she had visited in this neighborhood once when she was a young lady. she said the house had six white columns across the front and that there was an avenue of oaks leading up to it and two little wooden trellis

arbors on either side in front where you sat down with your suitor after a stroll in the garden. she recalled exactly which road to turn off to get to it. she knew that bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the more she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin arbors were still standing. "there was a secret panel in this house," she said craftily, not telling the truth but wishing that she were, "and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in it when sherman came through but it was never found . . ."

"hey!" john wesley said. "let's go see it! we'll find it! we'll poke a

"we never have seen a house with a secret panel!" june star shrieked. "let's go to the house with the secret panel! hey pop, can't we go see the house with the secret panel!"

"it's not far from here, i know," the grandmother said. "it wouldn't take over twenty minutes."

bailey was looking straight ahead. his jaw was as rigid as a horseshoe. "no," he said.

the children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret panel. john wesley kicked the back of the front seat and june star hung over her mother's shoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their vacation, that they could never do what they wanted to do. the baby began to scream and john wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father c

"all right!" he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. "will you all shut up? will you all just shut up for one second? if you don't shut up, we won't go anywhere.

"it would be very educational for them," the grandmother murmured.

"all right," bailey said, "but get this: this is the only time we're going to stop for anything like this. this is the one and only time."

"the dirt road that you have to turn down is about a mile back," the grandmother directed. "i marked it when we passed."

all. john wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.

"you can't go inside this house," bailey said. "you don't know who lives there."

"while you all talk to the people in front, i'll run around behind and get in a window," john wesley suggested.

"we'll all stay in the car," his mother said. they turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust. the grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a day's journey. the dirt road was hilly and there were sudden washes in it and sharp curves on dangerous embankments. all a

t once they would be on a hill, looking down over the blue tops of trees for miles around, then the next minute, they would be in a red depression with the dust-coated trees looking down on them.

"this place had better turn up in a minute," bailey said, "or i'm going to turn around."

the road looked as if no one had traveled on it in months.

"it's not much farther," the grandmother said and just as she said it, a horrible thought came to her. the thought was so embarrassing that she turned red in the face and her eyes dilated and her feet jumped up, upsetting her valise in the corner. the instant the valise moved, the newspaper top she had over the basket under it rose with a snarl and pitty sing,the cat, sprang onto bailey's shoulder.

the children were thrown to the floor and their mother, clutching the baby, was thrown out the door onto the ground; the old lady was thrown into the front seat. the car turned over once and landed right-side-up in a gulch off the side of the road. bailey remained in the driver's seat with the cat-gray-striped with a broad white face and an orange nose-clinging to his neck like a caterpillar.

as soon as the children saw they could move their arms and legs, they scrambled out of the car, shouting, "we've had an accident!" the grandmother was curled up under the

dashboard, hoping she was injured so that bailey's wrath would not come down on her all at once. the horrible thought she had had before the accident was

that the house she had remembered so vividly was not in georgia but in tennessee.

bailey removed the cat from his neck with both hands and flung it out the window against the side of a pine tree. then he got out of the car and started looking for the children's mother. she was sitting against the side of the red gutted ditch, holding the screaming baby, but she only had a cut down her face and a broken shoulder. "we've had an accident!" the children screamed in a frenzy of delight.

"but nobody's killed," june star said with disappointment as the grandmother limped out of the car,

her hat still pinned to her head but the broken front brim standing up at a jaunty angle and the violet spray hanging off the side. they all sat down in the ditch, except the children, to recover from the shock. they were all shaking.

"maybe a car will come along," said the children's mother hoarsely.

"i believe i have injured an organ," said the grandmother, pressing her side, but no one answered her. bailey's teeth were clattering. he had on a yellow sport shirt with bright blue parrots designed in it and his face was as yellow as the l shirt. the grandmother decided that she would not mention that the house was in tennessee.

the road was about ten feet above and they could see only the tops of the trees on the other side of it. behind the ditch they were sitting in there were more woods, tall and dark and deep. in a few minutes they saw a car some distance away on top of a hill, coming slowly as

 said quietly to the boy with the gray hat.

"what you got that gun for?" john wesley asked. "whatcha gonna do with that gun?"

"lady," the man said to the children's mother, "would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? children make me nervous. i want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at."

"what are you telling us what to do for?" june star asked.

behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. "come here," said their mother.

"look here now," bailey began suddenly, "we're in a predicament! we're in . . ."

the grandmother shrieked. she scrambled to her feet and stood staring. "you're the misfit!" she said. "i recognized you at once!"

"yes'm," the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be known, "but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn't of reckernized me."

bailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the children.

bobby lee," he said. "you know they make me nervous." he looked at the six of them huddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn't think of anything to say. "ain't a cloud in the sky," he remarked, looking up at it. "don't see no sun but don't see no cloud neither."

"yes, it's a beautiful day," said the grandmother. "listen," she said, "you shouldn't call yourself the misfit because i know you're a good man at heart. i can just look at you and tell "

"hush!" bailey yelled. "hush! everybody shut up and let me handle this!" he was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn't move.

"i prechate that, lady," the misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.

"it'll take a half a hour to fix this here car," hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.

"well, first you and bobby lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you," the misfit said, point

ing to bailey and john wesley. "the boys want to ast you some- thing," he said to bailey. "would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?"

"listen," bailey began, "we're in a terrible predicament! nobody realizes what this is," and his voice cracked. his eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained perfectly still.

the grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. she stood staring at it and after a second she let it fall on the ground. hiram pulled bailey up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. john wesley caught hold of his father's ha

nd and bobby lee followed. they went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, "i'll be back in a minute, mamma, wait on me!"

"come back this instant!" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.

"bailey boy!" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at the misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. "i just know you're a good man," she said desperately. "you're not a bit common!"

"nome, i ain't a good man," the misfit said after a second as if he had considered her statement carefully, "but i ain't the worst in the world neither. my daddy said i was a different breed of dog from my brothers and sisters. 'you know,' daddy said, 'it's some that can live their w

"i'm sorry i don't have on a shirt before you ladies," he said, hunching his shoulders slightly. "we buried our clothes that we had on when we escaped and we're just

"that's perfectly all right," the grandmother said. "maybe bailey has an extra shirt in his suitcase."

"i'll look and see terrectly," the misfit said.

"where are they taking him?" the children's mother screamed.

"daddy was a card himself," the misfit said. "you couldn't put anything over on him. he never got in trouble with the authorities though. just had the knack of handling them."

"you could be honest too if you'd only try," said the grandmother. "think how wonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about so

s after you," he murmured.

the grandmother noticed how thin his shoulder blades were just behind-his hat because she was standing up looking down on him. "do you ever pray?" she asked.

he shook his head. all she saw was the black hat wiggle between his shoulder blades. "nome," he said.

there was a pistol shot from the woods, followed closely by another. then silence. the old lady's head jerked around. she could hear the wind move through the tree tops like a long satisfied insuck of breath. "bailey boy!" she called.

"i was a gospel singer for a while," the misfit said. "i been most everything. been in the arm service, both land and sea, at home and abroad, been twict married, been an undertaker, been with the railroads, plowed mother earth, been in a tornado, seen a man burnt alive oncet," and he looked up at the children's mother and the little girl who were sitting close together, their faces white and their eyes glassy; "i even seen a woman flogged," he said.

"lady," the misfit said, looking beyond her far into the woods, "there never was a body that give the undertaker a tip."

there were two more pistol reports and the grandmother raised her head like a parched old turkey hen crying for water and called, "bailey boy, bailey boy!" as if her heart would break.

"jesus was the only one that ever raised the dead," the misfit continued, "and he shouldn't have done it. he shown everything off balance. if he did what he said, then it's nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow him, and if he didn't, then it's nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can-by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. no pleasure but meanne
