d life was worth something now, and it would be hard to die. in the old jail he had not valued it; once, he was tempted to destroy it; but something, he did not know what, had prevented him; perhaps it was fear. he had heard those who profess to be religious declare there was no heaven for self-murderers; and as his life had been pretty hot here, he did not desire a continuation of the same in another world. "if i die now," he exclaimed, "thank god, i shall die a freeman!"

        he begged my uncle phillip not to return south; but stay and work with him, till they earned enough to buy those at home. his brother told him it would kill their mother if he deserted her in her trouble. she had pledged her house, and with difficulty had raised money to buy him. would he be bought?

        "no, never!" he replied. "do you suppose, phil, when i have got so far out of their clutches, i will give them one red cent? no! and do you suppose i would turn mother out of her home in her old age? that i would let

        hope died away in my heart as he closed the door after him. i had calculated that in his rage he would sell me to a slave-trader; and i knew the father of my child was on the watch to buy me.

        about this time my uncle phillip was expected to return from a voyage. the day before his departure i had officiated as bridesmaid to a young friend. my heart was then ill at ease, but my smiling countenance did not betray it. only a year had passed; but what fearful changes it had wrought! my heart had grown gray in misery. lives that flash in sunshine, and lives that are born in tears, receive their hue from circumstances. none of us know what a year may bring forth.

        the doctor, more exasperated than ever, again tried to revenge himself on my relatives. he arrested uncle phillip on the charge of having aided my flight. he was carried before a court, and swore truly that he knew nothing of my intention to escape, and that he had not seen me since i left my master's plantation. the doctor then demanded that he should give bail for five hundred dollars that he would have nothing to do with me. several gentlemen offered to be security for him; but mr. sands told him he had better go back to jail, and he would see that he came out without giving bail.

 as my own, nothing might occur to bring out his dagger. we walked on till we came to the wharf. my aunt nancy's husband was a seafaring man, and it had been deemed necessary to let him into our secret. he took me into his boat, rowed out to a vessel not far distant, and hoisted me on board. we three were the only occupants of the vessel. i now ventured to ask what they proposed to do with me. they said i was to remain on board till near dawn, and then they would hide me in snaky swamp, till my uncle phillip had prepared a place of concealment for me. if the vessel had been bound north, it would have been of no avail to me, for it would certainly have been searched. about four o'clock, we were again seated in the boat, and rowed three miles to the swamp. my fear of snakes had been

and anxious. the following sabbath was calm and clear; so beautiful that it seemed like a sabbath in the eternal world. my grandmother brought the children out on the piazza, that i might hear their voices. she thought it would comfort me in my despondency; and it did. they chatted merrily, as only children can. benny said, "grandmother, do you think uncle will has gone for good? won't he ever come back again? may be he'll find mother. if he does, won't she be glad to see him! why don't you and uncle phillip, and all of us, go and live where mother is? i should like it; wouldn't you, ellen?"

        "yes, i should like it," replied ellen; "but how could we find her? do you know the place, grandmother? i don't remember how mother looked—do you, benny?"

        benny was just beginning to describe me when they were interrupted by an old slave woman, a near neighbor,

        mr. sands told my uncle phillip the particulars about william's leaving him. he said, "i trusted him as if he were my own brother, and treated him as kindly. the abolitionists talked to him in several places; but i had no idea they could tempt him. however, i don't blame william. he's young and inconsiderate, and those northern rascals decoyed him. i must confess the scamp was very bold about it. i met him coming down the steps of the astor house with his trunk on his shoulder, and i asked him where he was going. he said he w

        in the midst of these meditations, i heard footsteps on the stairs. the door opened, and my uncle phillip came in, leading ellen by the hand. i put my arms round her, and said, "ellen, my dear child, i am your mother." she drew back a little, and looked at me; then, with sweet confidence, she laid her cheek against mine, and i folded her to the heart that had been so long desolated. she was the first to speak. raising her head, she said, inquiringly, "you really are my mother?" i told her i really was; that during all the long time she had not seen me, i had loved her most tenderly; and that now sh

"grandmother says i ought not to cry; that i am going to a good place, where i can learn to read and write, and that by and by i can write her a letter. but i shan't have benny, or grandmother, or uncle phillip, or any body to love me. can't you go with me? o, do go, dear mother!"

        it had never occurred to mrs. flint that slaves could have any feelings. when my grandmother was consulted, she at once said she wanted nancy to lie with all the rest of her family, and where her own old body would be buried. mrs. flint graciously complied with her wish, though she said it was painful to her to have nancy buried away from her. she might have added with touching pathos, "i was so long used to sleep with her lying near me, on the entry floor."

        my uncle phillip asked permission to bury his sister at his own expense; and slaveholders are always ready to grant such favors to slaves and their relatives. the arrangements were very plain, but perfectly respectable. she was buried on the sabbath, and mrs. flint's minister read the funeral service. there was a large concourse of colored people, bond and free, and a few white persons who had always been friendly to our family. dr. flint's carriage was in the procession; and when the body was deposited in its

        after ellen left us, this feeling increased. mr. sands had agreed that benny might go to the north

        my grandmother lived to rejoice in my freedom; but not long after, a letter came with a black seal. she had gone "where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest."

        time passed on, and a paper came to me from the south, containing an obituary notice of my uncle phillip. it was the only case i ever knew of such an honor conferred upon a colored person. it was written by one of his friends, and contained these words: "now that death has laid him low, they call him a good man and a useful citizen; but what are eulogies to the black man, when the world has faded from his vision? it does not require man's praise to obtain rest in god's kingdom." so they called a colored man a citizen! strange words to be uttered in that region!
