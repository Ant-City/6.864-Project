phie went to the mailbox. the mailman had just delivered the
day's mail. sophie fished out a bulky pile of junk mail, periodicals, and a couple of
letters for her mother. there was also a postcard of a tropical beach. she turned the
card over. it had a nor-wegian stamp on it and was postmarked "un battalion."
could it be from dad? but wasn't he in a completely different place? it wasn't his
handwriting either.
sophie felt her pulse quicken a little as she saw who the postcard was addressed to:
"hilde moller knag, c/o sophie amundsen, 3 clover close ..." the rest of the address
was correct. the card read:
dear hilde, happy 15th birthday! as i'm sure you'll understand, i want to give you a
present that will help you grow. forgive me for sending the card c/o sophie. it was the
easiest way. love from dad.
sophie raced back to the house and into the kitchen. her mind was in a turmoil. who
was this "hilde," whose fifteenth birthday was just a month before her own?
sophie got out the telephone book. there wer

r of a birthday card by purposely sending it astray? how could it be "the
easiest way"? and above all, how was she supposed to trace this hilde person?
so now sophie had another problem to worry about. she tried to get her thoughts in
order: 
this afternoon, in the space of two short hours, she had been presented with three
problems. the first problem was who had put the two white envelopes in her mailbox.
the second was the difficult questions these letters contained. the third problem was
who hilde moller knag could be, and why sophie had been sent her birthday card.
she was sure that the three problems were interconnected in some way. they had to
be, because until today she had lived a perfectly ordinary life.

... the only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder...
sophie was sure she would hear from the anonymous letter writer again. she decided
not to tell anyone about the letters for the time being.
at school she had trouble concentrating on what the teachers

whole universe. we who live here are microscopic insects existing deep down in the
rabbit's fur. but philosophers are always trying to climb up the fine hairs of the fur in
order to stare right into the magician's eyes.
are you still there, sophie? to be continued . . .
sophie was completely exhausted. still there? she could not even remember if she
had taken the time to breathe while she read.
who had brought this letter? it couldn't be the same person who had sent the birthday
card to hilde moller knag because that card had both a stamp and a postmark. the
brown envelope had been delivered by hand to the mailbox exactly like the two white
ones.
sophie looked at her watch. it was a quarter to three. her mother would not be home
from work for over two hours.
sophie crawled out into the garden again and ran to the mailbox. perhaps there was
another letter. 
she found one more brown envelope with her name on it. this time she looked all
around but there was nobody in sight. sophie ran to the edge

ly that, it seemed as though the other girl had winked at
sophie as if to say: i can see you, sophie. i am in here, on the other side.
sophie felt her heart beating, and at the same time she heard a dog barking in the
distance. hermes! she had to get out of here at once. then she noticed a green wallet
on the chest of drawers under the mirror. it contained a hundred-crown note, a fifty, 
and a school i.d. card. it showed a picture of a girl with fair hair. under the picture
was the girl's name: hilde moller knag ...
sophie shivered. again she heard the dog bark. she had to get out, at once!
as she hurried past the table she noticed a white envelope between all the books and
the pile of paper. it had one word written on it: sophie.
before she had time to realize what she was doing, she grabbed the envelope and
stuffed it into the brown envelope with the plato pages. then she rushed out of the
door and slammed it behind her.
the barking was getting closer. but worst of all was that the boat was gone. aft

vered.
"i know," said sophie.
joanna sat bolt upright and looked sophie in the eye.
"so you have been here before!"
"yes, i guess i have." 
it suddenly struck her that it would have been a whole lot easier if she had just
admitted she had been here before. it couldn't do any harm if she let her friend in on
the mysterious things she had experienced during the last few days.
"i didn't want to tell you before we were here."
joanna began to read the cards.
"they are all addressed to someone called hilde moller knag."
sophie had not touched the cards yet.
"what address?"
joanna read: "hilde moller knag, c/o alberto knox, lillesand, norway."
sophie breathed a sigh of relief. she was afraid they would say c/o sophie amundsen.
she began to inspect them more closely.
"april 28 ... may 4 ... may 6 ... may 9 ... they were stamped a few days ago."
"but there's something else. all the postmarks are norwegian! look at that... un

"i think that's the way they do it. they h

n the kitchen fixing dinner before her mother got home.
it was their regular friday agreement. today she was making fish soup with fish balls
and carrots. plain and simple.
outside it was becoming windy. as sophie stood stirring the casserole she turned
toward the window. the birch trees were waving like cornstalks.
suddenly something smacked against the window-pane. sophie turned around again
and discovered a card sticking to the window.
it was a postcard. she could read it through the glass: "hilde moller knag, c/o sophie
amundsen."
she thought as much! she opened the window and took the card. it could hardly have
blown all the way from lebanon!
this card was also dated june 15. sophie removed the casserole from the stove and 
sat down at the kitchen table. the card read:
dear hilde, i don't know whether it will still be your birthday when you read this card.
i hope so, in a way; or at least that not too many days have gone by. a week or two for
sophie does not have to mean just as long for us. i sha

k where the girl had been sitting. she
picked it up and held it in her hand. then she woke up.
sophie looked at the clock. she had been asleep for two hours. she sat up in bed,
thinking about the strange dream. it was so real that she felt as if she had actually
lived the experience. she was equally sure that the house and the dock really existed
somewhere. surely it resembled the picture she had seen hanging in the major's cabin?
anyway, there was no doubt at all that the girl in her dream was hilde moller knag
and that the man was her father, home from lebanon. in her dream he had looked a 
lot like alberto knox ...
as sophie stood up and began to tidy her bed, she found a gold crucifix on a chain
under her pillow. on the back of the crucifix there were three letters engraved: hmk.
this was not the first time sophie had dreamed she found a treasure. but this was
definitely the first time she had brought it back from the dream.
"damn!" she said aloud.
she was so mad that she opened the closet door and

hermes walked toward no. 14, where he stood still and waited for sophie to open the
door. her heart began to beat faster.
inside the front door there were a number of green mailboxes attached to a panel.
sophie noticed a postcard hanging from one of the mailboxes in the top row. it had a
stamped message from the mailman across it to the effect that the addressee was
unknown.
the addressee was hilde moller knag, 14 new square. it was postmarked june 15.
that was not for two weeks, but the mailman had obviously not noticed that.
sophie took the card down and read it:
dear hilde, now sophie is coming to the philosopher's house. she will soon be
fifteen, but you were fifteen yesterday. or is it today, hilde? if it is today, it must be
late, then. but our watches do not always agree. one generation ages while another
generation is brought forth. in the meantime history takes its course. have you ever

 the card when the last bell rang. once again
her thoughts were in turmoil.
joanna was waiting in the playground. on the way home sophie opened her
schoolbag and showed joanna the latest card.
"when is it postmarked?" asked joanna.
"probably june 15 ..."
"no, look ... 5/30/90, it says." 
 "that was yesterday ... the day after the death of the major in lebanon."
"i doubt if a postcard from lebanon can get to norway in one day," said joanna.
"especially not considering the rather unusual address: hilde moller knag, c/o sophie
amundsen, fu-rulia junior high school..."
"do you think it could have come by mail? and the teacher just popped it in your
exercise book?"
"no idea. i don't know whether i dare ask either."
no more was said about the postcard.
"i'm going to have a garden party on midsummer eve," said sophie.
"with boys?"
sophie shrugged her shoulders. "we don't have to invite the worst idiots."
"but you are going to invite jeremy?"
"if you want. by the way, i might invite alberto knox."
"you must be

she lost the coin here on new square. it is then perfectly possible that the very same
coin was picked up later on that day by a girl who really needed it to get home by bus.
you never can tell, hilde, but if it is truly so, then one must certainly ask whether or
not god's providence is behind everything. love, dad, who in spirit is sitting on the
dock at home in lillesand. p.s. i said i would help you find the ten crowns.
on the address side it said: "hilde moller knag, c/o a casual passer-by..." the
postmark was stamped 6/15/90.
sophie ran up the stairs after hermes. as soon as alberto opened the door, she said:
"out of my way. here comes the mailman."
she felt she had every reason to be annoyed. alberto stood aside as she barged in.
hermes laid himself down under the coat pegs as before.
"has the major presented another visiting card, my child?"
sophie looked up at him and discovered that he was wearing a different costume. he
had put on a long curled wig a

"socrates would most likely have said the same. or descartes, for that matter."
"socrates was a greek philosopher who lived from 470 to 399 b.c. if you wish to
know more, press f7. descartes was a french philosopher who lived from 1596 to
1650. if you wish to know more, press f7."
"thank you, that will be quite enough. can i ask you something else?"
"i am glad that this was enough. go ahead and ask!"
alberto laughed quietly. sophie wrote:
"who is hilde moller knag?"
"hilde moller knag lives in lillesand and is exactly the same age as sophie
amundsen."
"how do you know?"
"i don't know how. i found her on the hard disc."
sophie felt a hand on her shoulder.
"i have fed the data program with the little information we have about hilde," said
alberto.
"what else do you know about hilde?" wrote sophie.
"hilde's father is a un observer in lebanon. he has the rank of major and
continually sends postcards to his daughter."
"i want you to find him!"
"i can't do tha

 million and then just as you're getting the money you wake up." 
sophie ran across the squelching playing field. minutes later she saw someone come
running toward her. it was her mother. the sky was pierced again and again by angry
darts of lightning.
when they reached each other sophie's mother put her arm around her.
"what's happening to us, little one?"
"i don't know," sophie sobbed. "it's like a bad dream."

hilde moller knag awoke in the attic room in the old captain's house outside
lillesand. she glanced at the clock. it was only six o'clock, but it was already light.
broad rays of morning sun lit up the room.
she got out of bed and went to the window. on the way she stopped by the desk and
tore a page off her calendar. thursday, june 14, 1990. she crumpled the page up and
threw it in her wastebasket.
friday, june 15, 1990, said the calendar now, shining at her. way back in january she
had written "15th birthday"

ather was far from home, too. she was probably the girl hilde would be
getting to know ...
only by conjuring up an intense feeling of one day being dead could she appreciate
how terribly good life was... . where does the world come from? ... at some point
something must have come from nothing. but was that possible? wasn't that just as
impossible as the idea that the world had always existed?
hilde read on and on. with surprise, she read about sophie amundsen receiving a
postcard from lebanon: "hilde moller knag, c/o sophie amundsen, 3 clover
close..."
dear hilde, happy 15th birthday. as i'm sure you'll understand, i want to give you a
present that will help you grow. forgive me for sending the card c/o sophie. it was the
easiest way. love from dad.
the joker! hilde knew her father had always been a sly one, but today he had really
taken her by surprise! instead of tying the card on the package, he had written it into 
the book.
but poor sophie! she must have been totally confused!
why would a father s

hilde moller knag jumped out of bed with the bulky ring binder in her arms. she
plonked it down on her writing desk, grabbed her clothes, and dashed into the
bathroom. she stood under the shower for two minutes, dressed herself quickly, and
ran downstairs.
"breakfast is ready, hilde!"
"i just have to go and row first." 
"but hilde... !"
she ran out of the house, down the garden, and out onto the little dock. she untied the

alberto in this picture? yes, where were alberto and sophie?
she could not fathom that they were no more than "electromagnetic impulses" in her
father's brain. she could not fathom, and certainly not accept, that they were only
paper and printer's ink from a ribbon in her father's portable typewriter. one might
just as well say that she herself was nothing but a conglomeration of protein
compounds that had suddenly come to life one day in a "hot little pool." but she was
more than that. she was hilde moller knag.
she had to admit that the ring binder was a fantastic present, and that her father had
touched the core of something eternal in her. but she didn't care for the way he was
dealing with sophie and alberto.
she would certainly teach him a lesson, even before he got home. she felt she owed it
to the two of them. hilde could already imagine her father at kastrup airport, in
copenhagen. she could just see him running around like mad. 
hilde was now quite herself again. she rowed the boat back to th
